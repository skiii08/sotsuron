The Longest Yard," What a terrible remake!
","I give this 1 star out of 10.The original Longest Yard with Burt Reynolds had grit, interesting characters, good dialogue, good acting, and a overall good chemistry between the actors to create a very good movie. This remake is 180 degrees from what I just stated above. This is a slapstick and totally unfunny remake of the 1970's classic.The reason why I hate this movie is first, Chris Rock is totally unbelievable as the prison inmate who is supposed to be respected by all because he can you get things, however, all he does is just do his stupid one dimensional stand up in this movie. He just sucks in movies. He should just stick with voice-over work in animation where we don't have to see him. Second, the actor who played the evil warden was unbelievable as the menacing villain in this movie. That is not to say that I don't like this actor. He is good but just not convincing as the evil warden. In the original, the warden was played by the actor from Green Acres TV series and he played it very well. You really believed that the warden was certifiable psycho who was bent on winning at all cost. Third, the supporting prison inmates were not funny, and on top of that, most could not act. Fourth, it was annoying to see Courtney Cox playing the spurned lover of Adam Sandler in this movie. I do not like any movie that has any of the Friends cast in it. Those actors and actresses have had their moment of fame, and it is now time for them to disappear. Fifth, Adam Sandler does a very poor job of portraying the main character Crewe. In the original, Burt Reynolds brought a great dimension to the original character by showing the nuances of this burned out football player. Here, Sandler just plays his part in a stilted manner and he almost seem like he does not want to play this part nor be part of this movie at all. If you put all this factors together, you get one big pile of CRAP! Now, what I am saying is not to see this movie, but rather, it is not necessary to go out and purposely see this movie in a movie theater unless you can see at a substantial discount; meaning, for no more than two dollars. Just wait for it on DVD.",1,4,11,4 June 2005
Friday Night Lights," A well made movie worth seeing.
","I give this movie eight stars out of ten. Good story, solid writing, and a cast of good actors and actresses makes this a very enjoyable film.This movie is an adaptation of a book that actually chronicled a small town Texas high school football team that is consumed with winning the state championship. One of my friend who saw the movie with me was from a small town in Brazil. I did not know if she could relate to the story given that the subject is about American football but surprisingly she did because the theme is pretty universal. In her case, soccer was the fixation for her townspeople so she could relate to this movie.Given this movie is based on a real event, the story is gritty and realistic. The football action scenes were just great. Even if you are not a fan of American football, like my friend stated, the theme presented in this movie is universal.",8,0,1,18 October 2004
Alexander," This movie will make Alexander turn over in his grave!
","This movie gets 1 out of 10.Wow! This movie sucks. I mean really! It is bad. With a star-studded cast, a high budget, and a biography of a fascinating conqueror, you would think this movie would be great! Unfortunately it is not.The movie is about Alexander the Great, the Greek conqueror who conquered Egypt, Persia and up to the fringes of India by the time he was in his early thirties.I remember reading about him in my world history class back in school and being fascinated about his life and his exploits. I eagerly anticipated the making of this movie hoping it would measure up to my expectation but it did not.The movie was constantly going forward and backward in telling his life which made the movie chaotic. Maybe Oliver Stone was trying to be like Tarantino; if that is so, he failed.Stone skirted the issue of Alexander's homosexuality by not revealing his this issue openly. Alexander's homosexuality should not be a controversy because he was. In our time, homosexuality is a big issue but during that time, in Greek society, it was a big deal. In fact, the Greek ideal relationship is between a grown man and a young boy.In history, there has always been speculation whether Alexander was part of the plot to kill his father King Philip of Macedon because Philip had just taken another wife who had bore him a male child. This issue should have been more in the beginning of the story, but instead, it was shown in the middle of the movie.I could keep going on and on with examples but you get the picture. Moreover, the battle scenes, while good, was not great.Prior to the release of this movie, I saw a three hour documentary of Alexander on the History channel on cable television. It was fantastic. It literally blows away this movie ten times over. The story is told from the biography of Alexander, written by an ancient Greek and two Roman citizens. I believe one of the Romans only concentrated on Alexanders early years.Anyway, if you really want to know about Alexander, his life, and his exploits, then go check that out, or better yet, go buy a book on his life.",1,10,16,17 December 2004
Spider-Man 3," A big disappointment.
","I am a fan of Spiderman comic book. I have been collecting them since I was a young child. I know the origins of Peter Parker, how he became Spiderman, the origins of Sandman and his interaction with Spidey, and etc.That being said, I know you have to change the story when you adapt a book/comic book for movie purpose. I get that but I don't think they did it well. On top of that, the movie had just too many things going on. Due to this, the movie could not sufficiently delve deeper into a particular story line, even though the movie was over 2 hours. The movie just glossed over major characters or conflicts leaving the viewer, or at least me, less than satisfied.First of all, I cannot stand seeing Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. This just annoys greatly. If you are a Spiderman comic book collector like myself, you know that Mary Jane Watson was gorgeous. She was a supermodel and therefore, very beautiful. Dunst is cute but she is no supermodel. I don't know who picked her for this role, but as I said before in Spiderman 1 and 2, she should have been replaced. Hopefully she will be gone for Spiderman 4.Tobey Macguire is OK. He would not have been my first choice for Peter Parker role but he grew on me.In this movie, these are the things that were covered (the movie did not cover these things in this order): Petey's (Peter Parker) problems include finding out Sandman is the real killer of his uncle, he wants to propose to MJ (MaryJane Watson) but ultimately does not due to other reasons discussed below, Harry Osborne (his best friend) wants to kill him, MJ's career is in ruins and is now a waitress, Steve Brock is trying take Petey's job at the Daily Bugle so Petey's career is going nowhere, Petey has a new costume that is a living symbiotic-life form from out of space which makes him stronger and gives him self-confidence but is also trying to overtake his body, the origin of Sandman is shown and he is battling Spidey, and on and on.Let's start off with Harry Osborne. In the comic book, he becomes the Hobgoblin. Here, he has no name and his costume should be a variant of the Green Goblin but it is not. Fine, I could overlook this.Next, you have Sandman, a major villain and character within Spiderman stories. He becomes just ONE of the villains in this story. I mean you have 3 MAJOR villains in this story! I could understand 2 but 3! If they had done it well it would be OK but they did not.Next is the symbiotic life form. This life form's name escapes me now but he bonds with this life form when he was on another planet. Here, the life form comes to Earth as a meteorite in a fashion very much like the Blob. The story of this life form and its interaction with Petey should have been sufficient to constitute as being the sole villain in this movie but they brought in 2 more! I know I am belaboring the point but they just gloss over these great villains and it really annoys me.This movie had great special effects. That I will not deny but all of you know that that alone will not make a good movie. You have to have a good and smart script as well as good performance from your actors and actresses. Here, the story/script which is a major component of this movie was weak. There was too many superficial topics and characters covered but not in depth.I understand why Sony wanted to create a movie to override your senses because if I was a studio executive and I had OK'ed nearly 400 million dollars budget for this movie, I would want to make sure that I put in as many action scenes as possible to override the audience senses but at a certain point, enough is enough. You have to start developing the characters so that the audience can feel for these characters.I went to the movies with my friend and her 10 year old child. My friend and I did not like it while the child did. My friend does not know anything about Spiderman except what she saw in the movies.In my assessment of the Spiderman trilogy so far, I would have to say that Spiderman 1 was the best for me. Spiderman 1 was better than Spiderman 2 and 3 because Tom Osborne, the Green Goblin's character was really developed enough that you could really understand the villain; meaning, how he thinks and why he does such evil things. By the way, Willem Dafoe played this character really great.In the end, I recommend waiting for it to be released on DVD. If you cannot wait, then at least see it at matin√©e price.",1,14,26,7 May 2007
Cloverfield," Terrible movie!
","Wow! I thought Blair Witch Project sucked but this movie brings suckiness to a whole new level. First, I am not a fan of the 'Blair Witch' movie where you see the movie from the point of view of the person who is holding the camcorder. As you might expect, the movie shakes A lot. Now I heard from people and on the news that some people vomited and even fainted in the movie theaters because the erratic movie shots made them dizzy. I was not one of them. However, 'Blair Witch' type movies do annoy me. This movie feels like an indie movie but it's not because millions of dollars have been poured into this piece of dirt.The story is about a group of twenty somethings in New York City and one of them is going to Japan because he got a promotion. They throw a going away party where one of their friends shoots the event on his camcorder. During this party, there is an explosion many blocks away. They all go out and the head of Statue of Liberty falls onto their street. Then they see some sort of giant alien but don't know what it is since the movie only shows couple of seconds of it. Then there is more explosion. The power goes off. They see the military fighting it. The people try to escape on the Brooklyn Bridge but it collapse and some of the friends don't make it. Then they try to go and rescue a girl/friend who is in the alien attack area. They find her alive and try to escape on a military helicopter but the aliens attack it and they fall back on to the ground. They survive but the one who is carrying camcorder gets attacked. I think he is killed. I'm not sure because I was about throw my popcorn at this crappy movie along with what was left of my soda drink. The friends take the camcorder and take off to who knows where. The End.The only good thing about this movie was that the aliens looked cool.",1,1,3,6 February 2008
Ocean's Twelve," Just as I thought, the movie sucks.
","I give this 3 out 10 stars.Well, what can I say except my one line summary above sums up what I think about this movie. The movie is the sequel to Oceans 11 where several years have gone by and each characters have used their stolen money from the casino for variety of uses.However, their joyful situation will soon end as the owner of the casino, whose money they stoled from, shows up to each individual and basically say you have a certain amount of time to give him back his money or else. That is basically the story.As I was watching this, I just got simply annoyed by all the actor and actresses, especially Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, and Elliot Gould. They look such posers. Moreover, enough of already, let's get some fresh new faces on the big screen. I can't stand to see the same staple of actors and actresses over and over again.If you really want to see a good movie, see the original Oceans 11 starring the Rat Pack. When I see those guys on screen, to me, they epitomize 'coolness.'",3,1,2,17 December 2004
The Aviator," Good but not great.
","I give this 6 star out of 10.I would have given this 7 stars but the ending was not well done. I have to admit, I liked this movie although I did not want to since I cannot stand Di Caprio. That being said, he performed the part of Howard Hughes very well.The movie focused on parts of Howard Hughes life I did not know about. Howard Hughes was a rich man who inherited a fortune from his parents' business of making machinery tools. He, however, was not interested in the tool business and came to Hollywood to make movies. While making movies, he became interested in aviation as a result of making the movie Hell Cats. He created the now-defunct airline TWA. He became embroiled in personal battle with Juan Trippe, who was the head of Pan Am Airways. The film also showed how Trippe used his influence with public officials to stop TWA from expanding its business into Pan Am territories. In between all these projects and battles, he had time to date many women including starlets.I knew these facts, that I mentioned above, from seeing a documentary about him a while back but I did not know the intimate details of the relationship of some of these women he had relationship with and how his battle with Juan Trippe nearly drove him over the edge. Speaking of over the edge, I had no idea Howard Hughes had a huge OCD problem or obsessive compulsive behavior problem. This movie showed how this behavior became a constant thorn in his side.I could go on and on but I really liked this movie and this is in spite of Di Caprio and also Alec Baldwin. Now the reason why I gave this a 6 rather than 7 or above is that the movie does not go further than early 1950's of his life. I want to know more. I think a good biography of a person should show his beginning and also the end. Maybe the creators of this movie did not want to make a long movie but it leaves movie goers with only a half view of his life.Another thing I had problem with is the choice of actress to portray Ava Gardner. Ava Gardner was truly a stunning woman and the actress who portrayed her was pretty but does not come close to being on par with Gardner. With all the beautiful girls out there who are trying to make it into show business, couldn't the movie makers pick more beautiful actress to portray Gardner?",6,2,5,9 January 2005
28 Weeks Later," Not a good movie.
","I remember how I was really entertained when I saw 28 Days Later. I mean, zombies that run like an Olympic sprinter was simply genius! I have to admit though that the last half of that movie was not that good but the running zombies made the defect seemed minor.When I found out that there was going to be a sequel, I was waiting in anticipation of it. Unfortunately, I should have just waited for it to come out on DVD because the movie sucked. This time, the novelty of running zombies could no longer hide the poor story line.In 28 Weeks Later, the movie begins with British Isle still in the beginning stage of running zombies. In a countryside, you have a group of people that is barricaded in a house. They are being quiet so that they don't attract the attention of the zombies. One day, they hear a knocking on the door and it is a boy who is asking for help. They are hesitant at first but decide to open the door. They do but this attracts the zombies and they crash in and do what zombies do. In that group is a husband and wife. They are trying to escape but gets split up. The zombies will soon reach the wife and the kid. The husband wants to rescue them but fear grips him and decides to escape alone. The wife cries out for help but he keeps running and he escapes.Fast forward and over a month later, all the zombies die from starvation. The NATO led by the US, lead to assess the situation and then decides to repopulate the British Isle 28 weeks later.They bring in all those British expatriates back to England. In London, they have a 'green zone' where it is safe and there are plenty of US soldiers guarding it. Many of the soldiers are trying to bag up the dead bodies in order to burn it but there are too many and bodies are piling up on the side of the streets.Of the 15 thousand British expatriates are two teenagers, a boy and a girl. They are the children of the husband who ran away. They meet with the father and are happy but sad since their mother died. The father lies to the children how their mother died because he is too ashamed.The children later go to their old house and finds their mother in the house alive. The US soldier picks them up and examines the wife. She is found to be clean and not a zombie. The reason for this is that she has a genetic mutation that stops her from becoming a zombie. Her children also has the genetic mutation. The scientist discover that she is a carrier of the zombie virus even though she is immune to the virus.Before the scientist can decide what to do with her, the husband sees the wife and kisses her. She bites him on the tongue and instantly he becomes a zombie and kills her. Then he goes and starts making zombies and they in turn make zombies. Soon they are overrun with zombies. Some survivors try to escape and blow up the whole area. But some of the zombies escaped and went onto the continent of Europe, specifically France. So I guess this means there is going to be another one. I guess the next one is going to be 28 Months Later.My first problem with this movie is the repatriation after 28 weeks later. That does not make sense. Why would the authorities approve repatriation without knowing if the virus had truly been wiped out? I understand the story writers had to think of something but they had several years to think of a good plot. Is this the best they could do?! Also, I don't know about any of you but if my country just have been wiped out because of zombies, I would want to know what the hell happened and is there a cure for it before I go back. In the movies, you see all these expatriates just excited about going back home like it is some Woodstock fest.My second problem with the movie is that you have sole survivor of a zombie attack. I mean no one had survived except her and also she is found to be a carrier of the virus. Hello! You put guards around that woman like the kind that guards Fort Knox. But in the movie, there is one or two guards at most. That does not make sense.I mean, the movie tries to make the military in the movie like they are some bumbling idiot. Give me a break. If this is going to be comedic zombie movie then fine, but if it is going to be a serious horror movie, then use realistic story line. I could go on and tell you others but this is enough. You get the picture.",1,4,10,20 May 2007
The Village," VERY, VERY, VERY BORING AND EXTREMELY TERRIBLE FILM!!!
","I wish I had never seen this movie at all.  I am very angry that I wasted my time and spent good money on this terrible film!  What is this director thinking?!  Is he crazy or something?!  This is one of the worst movies I had ever seen and believe me, I have seen movies that are below B-type movies.  This movie is an 'F' movie!  It's been several hours since I had left the movie theater but I am still angry!This director portrays this movie as some thriller/horror movie but it was neither thrilling nor scary.  The only horrible thing was the idiots who approved the making of this film.  I will tell you how bad the movie was...for one hour and twenty minutes, nothing happened in this DAMN movie!!!  I wish I could write a whole bunch of expletives here because this film deserves that and more!When I found out what the secret that the village held, I just wanted to throw my beverage at the damn movie screen!  After that, I did not even wait for the movie to end.  I told my friend I am going to the snack bar in the theater and that he could meet me there once the movie is over.  The funny thing is once I started leaving, a whole bunch of people left as well.  Some of us congregated outside and cursed at the movie and the idiot director who made it.I mean, what was the director thinking when he made this film?  Was he on drugs?  Did he lose all creativity?  I do not have the answer but I know this, I will never go see his films in the future again.Below is the spoiler....of one hour and twenty minutes of the terrible film.
********SPOILERS********************The film never states it but it looks like the film takes place around 1800's in America, in some wooded area with a large clearing where this village exist.  The woods are supposedly inhabited by creatures that the villagers coined, 'the ones we do not speak of.'  The villagers cannot leave because the creatures will not let them.  It seems these creatures will not let visitors in as well.  The villagers and the creatures have an agreement to where the villagers will not enter the woods and in return, the creatures will not enter the village.  The villagers also offer animal sacrifices to the creatures.  Things began to go awry in the village when one of their members become ill.  He needs medical attention but such things are not available in the village.  One of the village member want to leave to go to the town for medical supply but is discouraged.  One of the village elders cannot take the charade any longer and shows the daughter a costume of the creature and reveals to her that the creatures do not exist and that it was created by the village elders to keep everyone inside the village.  They wanted to create some sort of utopia for themselves and their children, but importantly, they wanted no outsiders to influence their children.***********END SPOILERS***********************
That is it.  That is what the film is about!  If you still want to see the movie, just remember...I told you so.",1,2,4,3 August 2004
Quantum of Solace," Terrible movie!
","Where do I start. First of all, I want to say that I left the theater after 30 minutes because I could no longer stay and watch the rest of the movie. The movie, in my opinion, was that bad.What was wrong with it? (1) Bond movies usually have a great central villain. If you look at Bond movies from the 1960's through the 1980's, and for the most part the 1990's, Bond movies had interesting villains. The villain in this movie evokes little or no emotion in that you do not care if he wins or not because he is not diabolical enough. Bond villains are usually over the top and megalomaniac. The villain in this movie is just a generic bad guy in my opinion. Totally uninteresting.(2) This movie had no real substance in that there was a great deal of action but no real dialog. In a Bond movie, there is usually a great conversation between the characters. For example, those smart quips between Q and Bond or Moneypenny and Bond or the head of the MI6 and Bond. Most of the conversation in this movie very terse and uninteresting.(3) The gadgets is what makes Bond movies so interesting and something that people cannot wait to see. Do you all remember when Q would demonstrate some cool gadget to Bond and you just had to exclaim 'wow' because it was so interesting? There was none like that here. That is not to say that there was no interesting gadgets but that the gadgets that were presented only got a lukewarm response. For instance, Bond had this IPhone like cell phone that does more than your average IPhone but it does not evoke any exciting response because you know it will be within reach in a couple of years.(4) The action while 'nice' was scattered and not focused. The type of cinematography presently is to shake the camera, more or less, with the action. I personally never liked that style of movie making and find that disorienting. That's not to say that it was like that throughout the film but I noticed it during action sequences.(5) The new Bond is still not my cup of tea. Yes, he is probably more close to what Ian Fleming envisioned for Bond; meaning, gritty and no nonsense British agent but I grew up with Roger Moore, and in my opinion, Pierce Brosnan, and of course Sean Connery, are the 'classic' Bond.I will describe what I saw in that 30 minutes and you make up your mind.The movie starts with some chase scene through what looks like the Italian Alps. In the back of Bond car is some guy and he is delivered to MI6. The guy claims he is from some secretive agency and that they have members all over the world. At that point, one of the British agent in the room kills the guy and kills some of the people in the room and takes off, and Bond chases him until he is killed. He later searches for some clue of this organization in Haiti where he kills some man and assumes his identity. He saves a girl who is supposed to be killed by the very man whose identity he has stolen. The person who wanted her dead is suppose to be the central villain in this movie where he wants to destabilize some Latin American country so that they can take over a patch of land where there might be oil. That's it.",1,7,11,16 November 2008
Batman Begins," Captures the true spirit of Batman!
","I give this 8 out of 10! I hardly give this high score to movies but this movie deserves an 8! I have been waiting for so long for someone to make a true adaptation of my comic heroes that I literally gave up. Why is this movie so great and why should it deserve a 9? Let's look at the origins of Batman. Batman was a creation of Bob Kane who created this during the Great Depression of United States. Poverty, unemployment, and hopelessness was prevalent during this time. Using this as his backdrop, Bob Kane delivered a hero portraying the realities of the time. The character appealed to readers because Batman had no special powers like Superman who appealed to the fantasy side of people. Batman was realistic. He was simply a man with conviction to do justice against criminals. This is what Batman was about.During the 1960's, Batman appeared on TV as a children's show so Batman and his villains were made with comedic features and simple dialog. None of the realism of Batman ever materialized.During the 1960's, 1970's, and the first half of 1980's, the general sales of comic books were on the decline, especially older characters like Batman. Batman comics mirrored the TV series by writing fluffy stories, thereby losing even more readers. However, good stories would appear now and then such as the arch villain Ra's Al Ghul in 1971.In 1986, a highly talented Frank Miller took hold of the Batman series and created a fantagraphic story it called 'The Dark Knight Returns.' I remember purchasing this big bound book, which was very expensive, and just simply awe struck at the character development, story, and the art. He brought back the spirit of Batman again. It was truly a momentous moment because this fantagraphic novel brought back interest in Batman and Hollywood took notice of it. However, Hollywood never truly appreciated the character that was Batman and would create a trio of disappointing adaptation of Batman on the big screen.In 1989, Tim Burton was the director of Batman, the story by Sam Hamm, screenplay by Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren. The director, the story, and the screenplay all failed. Tim Burton tried to mesh the 1960's Batman series with the spirit of the original Batman comic series but failed. I like Michael Keaton and I think he is a great actor but he should have not been cast as Batman and Kim Basinger was simply annoying. The only thing that saved that movie was Jack Nicholson as the Joker.In 1992, in Batman Returns, Tim Burton directs and the story is co-written by Daniel Waters and Sam Hamm, and screenplay is by Daniel Waters. Again it failed for the same reason above. However, there was a bit more substance into the movie with the story about the origins of Penguin but it was done so humorously that I simply could not get into the character. I mean, the scene where the Penguin, played by Danny De Vito dies and these giant penguins take his body away was so hilarious that I just laughed and shook my head in disbelief. The only thing I liked in this film was Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman.In 1995, Tim Burton is no longer directing (thank god) but now you have Joel Schumacher who is even worse! Story is by Lee Batchler and Janet Scott Batchler. Screenplay by Lee Batchler and Janet Scott Batchler and Akiva Goldsman. You had more people working on the story and it sucked, and this time it sucked big time! Val Kilmer played Batman! Oh my god, give me a break! I think he is a talented actor but bad casting. The studio must have known that this movie sucked because they just threw in all big name stars at the time and hoped that movie goers will not pay attention to the substance of this crappy movie! In 2005, when I heard Hollywood was going to do another Batman movie, needless to say, I was highly skeptical and quite cynical given its past three movies which were all crap. That is the reason why I did not go and see the movie immediately but rather waited to see the reviews. I was surprised at the highly positive reaction of the movie critics and general movie viewers but I was still skeptical and waited until this weekend to this movie.Whenever there is an adaptation from a book, comic book, video games or whatever to the movie screen, literal adaptation usually does not work. I was curious as I sat in the movie seat on how many thing they would change Batman in this movie.First of all---WOW! What a fantastic movie! It really captured the spirit of Batman! There were some things I would have changed but this is as close to nirvana for someone who has been a Batman aficionado for a long time. No fluff, no inane story or dialog; only hard-edged-gritty story. Exactly what Batman is meant to be. I liked Christian Bale as Batman. He did not come off as cocky as Val Kilmer or as stilted as Michael Keaton. Katie Holmes was also good as an ancillary figure. She was not annoying like Kim Basinger. I was worried when I saw so many movie stars in the movie because that means the story would suck but I was totally wrong. No one star upstage the true star of this movie---Batman.I knew that the movie would change things but I was surprised that Ra's Al Ghul was portrayed as a good guy and that the young Bruce Wayne would go off to find himself for 7 years. Surprisingly though, it all worked. If you can make me like this movie, a true comic book Batman fan, then that says something about this movie.",8,0,0,26 June 2005
Meet the Fockers," Wait for it to appear in your neighborhood videostore.
","I give this 4 stars out of 10.This is a sequel to Meet the Parents. The story is basically that the parents of both the bride and groom meet to get know each other. The movie had its moments of laughter but not enough compared to the first movie. A friend a mine and I had an argument over my low rating for this movie, arguing that this movie should stand alone rather than be compared to the original but I think this is totally incorrect. It was due to the strength of the original movie that gave the impetus to make this sequel and unfortunately, the sequel just did not measure up to the original.I have to confess, one of my biggest problem was casting Barbara Streisand as the mother of the groom. I just cannot stand her. She is annoying both on screen and offscreen. I tried hard to not let that influence my rating of this movie but subsconsciously, it probably did. I did like Dustin Hoffman as the father of the groom. It's refreshing to see him play a comedic role now and then.It is not a movie that you need to go out and see in theater. You could wait and just rent it.",4,3,7,29 December 2004
Ghost Rider," This movie sucked.
","Where do I start. The screenplay was done poorly. The dialog was inane. Nicolas spewed out all these stupid one liners which really annoyed me. When will movie studios recognize that one liners alone do not make a good movie?! The special effects were fine. They were not ground breaking but good for what it was. That is the only positive thing I could say about this movie. Like the movie Daredevil, the wrong actor was placed to play the main character, Johnny Blaze. I am not saying Nicolas Cage is a bad actor---far from it. However, he should not have been chosen for this part. Whoever chose him should be fired. Remember, Michael Keaton was chosen to play Batman and he was a good actor but as Batman, he sucked. It was not until Christian Bale was chosen to play Batman that you could really see what Batman was about. Also, the last Batman movie in 'Batman Begins,' the story was told in a serious and thoughtful manner. Previous Batman movies were campy and just stupid. Ghost rider, unfortunately, follows those terrible Batman movies by being campy and just stupid.In this movie, Nicolas Cage was comical. You could tell by watching this movie that he thought this movie sucked so he overplayed his part.Just stay away. Wait for it on video or cable.",1,1,5,19 February 2007
Hero," Pretty picture but typical Hong Kong film
","The only reason why I am commenting is because this movie is currently opening all across the US.  I saw this movie about 2 years ago when I was on a business trip to Hong Kong.  First of all, I am not a fan of the martial arts film where people are flying all over the place, regardless how pretty it might seem.  Second, I generally like realism in my martial arts movies, although I love those Hong Kong martial arts movies from the 1970's and 1980's.  I can accept certain amount of exaggeration for action sake but not flying like Superman.If you like Crouching Tiger Hidden Tiger, then you should like this movie although the former movie, in my opinion, had more of a story than this movie.  For those of you who do not know about Chinese history, around 500 BC to 300 or so BC, was called the warring states.  China had splintered into various feudal kingdoms with constant warfare being the norm.  Towards the latter part of this period, one kingdom began to dominate the others, which would eventually unify all of the feudal kingdoms.  Some of these kingdoms sent assassins to kill the future emperor of China.  One of the assassins is played by Jet Li.  His mission is to kill this new leader of this powerful kingdom.This type of martial arts movies have great cinematography but that is about it for me.  I am more partial to martial arts films such as Yojimbo or Game of Death.  Therefore, if you are like me and do not like martial artist flying like Superman, avoid it, but if you liked Crouching Tiger Hidden Tiger, then go see.  Better yet, go to your neighborhood Asian video store near you and rent it.  They should have it given this movie was release in other parts of the globe 2 years ago.  I am not sure if your Blockbuster video would carry this because the movie is currently playing in US theaters.",1,11,22,1 September 2004
Transformers," If I was not a Transformer fan, I would have given this movie a 1.
","Basically, the special effects were awesome. I could not get enough of the way the robots transformed. That was the high point. The low points are the story, dialog, and acting----they were terrible. The dialog was just stupid. The love interest of the main character was pretty but just a filler and was placed in this movie so that juvenile boys could go crazy over, which is not a bad thing if she had some decent script to work with and if she had the ability to act. Both of which I did not see.If I was not a fan of Transformers already, I would have given this movie a 1. If you want to check out a good Transformer series, then go rent Beast Wars or the old Transformer animation. The latter though is dated since it came out during the 1980's.",2,3,7,4 August 2007
Wimbledon," Not bad...
","I just saw this movie yesterday and I thought it was a decent love story. It certainly is better than the last British comedy/love story which was 'Love Actually.' That was simply horrible. I give this movie 5 out of 10 stars. It is a good movie to take to a date. It has something for both male and female viewers. While this movie revolves around tennis, you do not need to know anything about tennis to understand the movie.As for the characters, I thought Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany played their respective roles well. I always liked Dunst ever since 'Bring it on' although I still say she should have never played Maryjane in Spiderman. Whoever in the movie studio thought of that should have been fired. Bettany has, I'm sure, been in many movies but the one that stuck in my mind was when he played a squire in 'A Knight's Tale.' A good actor and I hope I see him in other roles.The premise of this movie is that it takes place in England. The tennis tournament called Wimbledon is about to start and an aging, has been British male tennis player ranked nearly the bottom, begins to develop relationship with a rising American female tennis player. The latter is driven to succeed while the former is just trying to finish the year so that he can retire and become a tennis instructor. They meet accidentally and begin to develop a relationship and over time, they begin to learn something about themselves and what love is about.",5,0,1,1 October 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Wow!
","I give this 9 stars out of 10.I usually do not give most movies anything above 7 because they just do not deserve it. Movies that are 8, 9, 10 have two things in common: great story and great performance. Every year, only a handful of movies, if at that, I believe deserve a score of 8 or above. The reason why I am discussing this is because I have friends who will be receiving their Academy ballots for the upcoming Oscar Awards and I hope some of them will give their vote to this movie.This movie is simply superb! Well written and very good performance. I cannot single out one person as standing out over others in this movie. Perhaps it is because you have three really good actors and actress who perform their craft so well that it seems effortless when you see them on the screen.The story! I mean, when I first heard the premise of this movie, I was simply turned off by it and did not watch it when it first came out in theaters. Big mistake. The saying, you cannot judge a book by its cover, is so true here.The movie is about a young woman (Hilary Swank) from a poverty background whose dream is to become a female boxer. She wants to train under a veteran trainer (Clint Eastwood) but he does not want to train her at first. The boxing gym's janitor (Morgan Freeman) gives her boxing advice so that she can train properly. Eventually, her perseverance wins out and the veteran trainer takes her under his tutelage. Things go well until tragedy strikes which causes the characters to evaluate what is truly important in their life.If this was simply a boxing story, I would give it no more than 6 stars. Thankfully it is not. Kudos to Rope Burns, F.X. Toole, and Paul Haggis, in bringing this story into creation. Further Kudos for director Clint Eastwood...the man is simply a juggernaut of talent.Seeing movies like this really makes all those other bad movies that I had watched throughout the year, bearable.",9,4,7,21 January 2005
Black Snake Moan," I liked it but this movie is not for everyone.
","This is a quirky or strange type of movie that will not appeal to the mass audience. The movie is about a poor white girl (Christina Ricci) from the South, somewhere in Tennessee I think, who is a nymphomaniac. Due to certain circumstances, she ends up on the road beaten up and unconscious. A black man (Samuel Jackson) finds her and takes her into his house. From there, they develop a strange relationship where they both try to help each other from their personal demons.When I saw the trailer and read the story about this movie, I thought, 'oh well...another crappy movie.' However, the movie was quite good. It certainly was different. This movie is not for everyone but then again, who knows. I think if people gave it a try, they might like it. It is gritty drama with moments that will make you laugh and perhaps cry.I thought everyone did a good job except Justin Timberlake. He was not bad but not good either. I rate his performance as OK. I understand why they chose him. It will certainly give the movie more exposure than without him.I also have to criticize the movie studio for the improper advertisement. If you see the trailer and the advertisement for this movie, you might think this is some sort of sadomasochistic movie involving a sex starved white female with a black man but that is far from the truth.A good movie with an original story and an excellent acting by most of the crew---sans Justin Timberlake.",7,1,4,6 March 2007
Saw," Great premise but it lacks a strong story and script to make it a great thriller.
","I had a chance to see this movie before it is released in US. I have to first start off by rating this movie five stars out of ten. I would have love to given it a higher score but the story, script, and acting did not live up to the movie's great premise.The premise of the movie is about two male characters who awake to find themselves chained in one leg to a plumbing pipe in a large locked room. Both are on opposite sides of the room and cannot reach each other. They are given clues to follow by a serial killer in order to escape imprisonment.The story and dialogue leaves one unsatisfied due to holes in the plot and acting in the movie. You could tell that SAW takes some of its inspiration from the great thriller SEVEN from the style of the movie as well as the ending but unlike SEVEN, this movie does not have strong character development to get one into the mind of the serial killer. The movie instead focuses mostly on the killer's acts until the very end , when you finally discover the reason behind these killings but instead of evoking sympathy or hatred toward the killer, you are left with a feeling of 'so what' or 'is that it?'My next criticism is the characters and the actors who played it. I felt there were too many characters in this movie. The writers should have concentrated primarily on those few characters so that the audience can have more time to relate to them and feel some sort of connection with them. I also thought certain actors should not have played that specific role because they do not fit that part. I won't name that person because I have been told by a studio friend that some studio executives do read some of these posting and I like that actor and would like to see that person in future movies but just not in a thriller. Danny Glover plays a police officer in this movie but again, I felt nothing for this person and it is not due to his acting because Glover gave a solid performance except the story and dialogue was just too weak for even Glover to overcome.Overall, a decent movie with great potential but failed in story development, lackluster dialogue, and mediocre casting. That being said, it is a good attempt for the Australian film grads Wan and Whannell.",5,0,0,17 October 2004
National Treasure," Pretty good movie.
","I give this 6 out of 10 stars.It was good movie. I have to admit, I thought the premise was stupid but I was wrong. The story is about the Founding Fathers of America and their ties with a secretive society called Freemasons which is somehow tied with the Knights of Templar of Medieval Europe. It seems that riches beyond belief was hoarded by these people throughout the ages and one of the keys to this treasure lies with the document, Declaration of Independence.I am not a fan of Cage but he did a good job in this movie. He plays the smart but obsessed person named Mr. Gates, who is on a mission to find the mother-of-all treasures. In his way is a dangerous man who once funded the endeavors of Mr. Gates, but are now rivals in this dangerous pursuit.I like the whole conspiracy and the tie in with the Knights of Templars. Again, a good movie. I could see why this movie did well in the box office.",6,0,0,17 December 2004
The Departed," Wow! You people are easy to please.
","I am a fan of Martin Scorsese but this movie sucks. This movie is a remake of a Hong Kong movie called 'Internal Affairs.' If you have never seen the original, then please do so because you will definitely appreciate how well the original was as opposed to this crap made by Scorsese.Why do I hate 'Departed?' First, Scorsese was an idiot putting Jack Nicholson as the crime boss because he is going to steal the whole damn movie. Nicholson is that talented. Plus, Scorsese gave too much part to the crime boss character. He should have been a tangential character with the real crux of the movie focused on Matt Damon and Di Caprio.Second, Matt Damon's character was too one dimensional or there was no real complexity to his character. He was simply bad. In Internal Affairs, the bad cop was more complex. In that movie, you see a cop becoming annoyed by the crime boss who he sees as a threat to his future.Third, there was more violence and sex in this movie than in Internal Affairs and I love gratuitous violence and sex in a movie so long as it is done properly. Scorsese just injected more sex and violence to cover up his terrible script adaption of an excellent film.Fourth, the dialog was fine but again, it lacks intelligent discourse among the principal characters so I cannot say it was great writing. It was simply mediocre at best.Fifth, and primary reason I hate this movie is that there is no real TENSION between the characters. Oh sure, Damon character wants to kill Di Caprio and vice a versa but there has to more to this than that. In the original, there was interaction between the bad cop and good cop, but you see that the bad cop is not so truly bad and therefore, the audience is torn. What I am trying to say is that there was a subtle buildup to the real tension in that movie which makes you really appreciative of the quality of that movie as oppose to this crap.That being said, if you have never seen Internal Affairs, then you will like this movie. But if you are like myself and some others who have seen it and have seen this movie as well, then you will be disappointed. In fact, for those who decide to rent Internal Affairs, I can almost guarantee that you will like Internal Affairs much more than Departed. You will like Internal Affairs so much more that you will see what a junk Departed really is.",1,38,70,17 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Better than Star Wars 4 and 5 but still a mediocre movie.
","I give this 2 out of 10.What can I say except the movie is decent but nothing I would go crazy over. I have to confess, I am not a big Star Wars fan. I remember the first time I saw Star Wars, I thought it was good but not great. This sentiment was the same when I saw 2 and 3. Of course, my opinion went down dramatically when I saw 4 and 5 because those two were simply terrible.This last movie pulls all the loose ends of first three trilogy and finally ends this saga. The questions is did it do a good job of it? I would say yes. The movie shows how the Republic falls, how the emperor came into being, how the Jedi's were all killed save Yoda and Kenobi, how Darth Vader came into being, how Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker are sister and brother, and etc.The next question is whether it is worth it to see the movie now and at full admission price at the movie theater. I would answer no to both. Make no mistake, I love science fiction movies but I never got into Stars Wars nor Star Trek movies, although I love the original Star Trek series. However, if you are a Stars Wars fanatic then you would like this movie and it would be worth full admission price.Again, if you are someone like me, then you can wait for it on DVD.",2,3,7,22 May 2005
Shall We Dance," Shall we say no?
","I give this three stars out of ten because of Richard Gere. Where can I start. Jennifer Lopez, it seems, has been taking dancing lessons since her breakup with Ben Affleck but her acting is still atrocious. She should have done the reverse. As for Richard Gere, I think he should punch out Julia Roberts for sucking up all his energy when they made Pretty Woman because ever since that movie, all his movie projects thereafter have been boring to terrible. The story is about a wills and trust attorney, played by Richard Gere, who in his middle age, married to wife (Susan Sarandon) and two teenage children, finds his life a tedium until he sees Jennifer Lopez peering out of a window of a dance studio, while commuting to and from work. He takes dance lessons to meet Jennifer Lopez but instead finds his passion renewed from learning how to dance.The part where Richard Gere is trying to learn how to dance was funny but that was about it. The rest of the movie is pretty much boring. I cannot attribute that to the acting because everyone gave a good performance but the story and script did not match the acting.Oh well, better luck next time Richard Gere. Maybe he should pair up with Louis Gossett Jr. and make an Officer and a Gentleman 2.",3,2,4,25 October 2004
Sin City," Disappointingly boring.
","I give this 1 star out of 10.I had high expectation when I saw this movie a couple of hours ago because of the high marks given by other reviewers but this movie sucks. In fact, I was so bored that I left the theater after viewing about 75% of the movie. I should have left earlier.The movie Sin City, as I understand it, was an adaptation of the graphic novel by Frank Miller. For those of you who do not know who he is, this guy is huge in the comic book industry. Although I have not read this series, I understand that it was very popular with the readers.First, what I liked about the movie was that it was in black and white, for the most part, while using color for certain objects to magnify a certain scene. That's about it for the likes and now the dislikes.What I did not like about the movie was that it was not one story but multiple separate stories in the movie. The movie was basically stories about this make believe place called Sin City and the crimes that plagues it. This multiple story telling does not give enough time for one to understand the characters of one story before it ends and a new story begins. I think the reason for telling the story in this fashion was to give an overall look at Sin City as the main character in this story. It is an interesting way of telling a story but it was not well done. The only recent movie that I could remember that had similar multiple story telling in one movie was Animatrix, the animated movie about the story of the Matrix. Unlike Animatrix, however, Sin City just was not done well done.Given that the movie had to show multiple stories within a certain amount of time, some things had to be cut, and in this case it was character development. Each character was flimsy in their demeanor with no distinguishable characteristics.As for the violence, I know some IMDb viewers did not appreciate the movie because of it but I love gratuitous violence as long as it is placed correctly. However, violence cannot be rampant throughout the movie because then it looks silly and comical, which is exactly how it looked in this movie. As Eddie Murphy once said, his comedy routine is not simply a series of bad words alone, but that there is a story in his comedy routine and that he uses bad words simply to accentuate it.Food for thought for future story tellers.",1,2,6,8 April 2005
Coach Carter," good movie.
","I give this a 6 out of 10 stars.It is a good movie but nothing outstanding. The story is based on a true event where a California high school basketball coach cancels practice and games due to the team's academic performance.Samuel Jackson plays a reluctant-just-hired basketball coach of a high school that is in an inner city area where crime and poverty is the norm. He makes them care about their academic as well as their basketball performance. Through this process, the students learn about team work and personal accountability.If you have seen the movie 'Lean on Me,' then this is that except a light version.",6,0,2,21 January 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," Great movie!
","Usually, the sequel to a movie is not as good as the original but in this case, the sequel is better than the original.  I remember reading Robert Ludlum's novels on the character Jason Bourne and being thoroughly entertained by it.  When I heard this character was to be made into a movie, I was a little wary because movie adaptation of a book is usually not well done and after seeing the first movie, I felt my fears were justified.  When I heard a second Bourne movie was going to be made, my wariness turned to anger.  I felt the first movie was not true to the novel and Matt Damon was the wrong actor to be portraying Bourne.  However, I am a masochist so I did go see the second Bourne movie and I am glad that I did.The writing was better than the first movie and I had gotten used to Matt Damon's face as Bourne that I was not annoyed by his presence on the screen at all.  The action was well done although a bit over the top in certain scenes but it did not hamper the realistic feeling for the story.*******POSSIBLE SPOILERS**********************The story takes place after the first Bourne movie where he tries to leave his past as being an assassin for the CIA behind him and try to live a normal life with his girlfriend in India.  But that is not to be when an assassin kills his woman instead of him, and that leads him on a rampage across Europe to find the reason why the CIA, he erroneously believes, is still after him even though he explicitly told his CIA contacts in the first Bourne movie, that he wanted no more part of the spy business. 
In his investigation, he finds that he is being framed as a killer of two CIA operatives who were on a mission to retrieve information regarding an important Russian citizen.  His quest for truth leads him to discover how the two CIA agents and his girlfriends death are all tied to a scheme planned by corrupted CIA and Russian officials.  Further, he begins to recall an assassination he once did which he begins to unravel is directly linked to the corrupted scheme.  
********END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS****************This movie is action-packed and well written.  If you are like me and enjoy a good spy movie, then look no further because this is it.",10,3,4,29 July 2004
The Simpsons Movie," It is only a 30 minute episode that has been stretched into a movie
","I wanted to like it but I was disappointed. This movie is basically three thirty minute episode combined into one. The story is OK, nothing great. You do see it on a big screen so that is interesting but that is not enough to warrant a full ticket price. The story is basically Homer messes up again and causes Springfield to be designated as a toxic dump so the government places a dome around Springfield trapping everyone inside. Homer redeems himself and saves Springfield and cleans up the toxic waste. If you are a Simpson fan like myself, then there is nothing new here. My friends child liked it though so if you have a small child, they should enjoy it. If you really don't have to watch it, then wait for it on DVD or even cable.",2,3,6,4 August 2007
