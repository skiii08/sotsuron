The Blair Witch Project," Not going to last.......
","This type of movie only appeals to a small number of people (not real movie watchers).  I would imagine the producers will make a few pennies on this one.  I know I was disappointed afer renting it.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  If you do get it, I would not recommend younger children to watch it (for fear of nightmares).  Id this was a new angle on filmmaking, lose it fast!!  It will not last long.........",Null,0,0,8 January 2000
