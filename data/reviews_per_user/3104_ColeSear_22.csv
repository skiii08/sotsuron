E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Beautiful Beyond Comparison (Spoilers)
","When a movie is a hit it's sometimes called 'home run.' But Steven Spielberg doesn't hit home runs he hits Grand Slams! If there is any film that absolutely defines Spielberg in my mind it's this one. This film is a complete and total success both as entertainment and within the framework of the director's objectives. It's very odd to look at these films in retrospect after most of them have already gone on to become world-wide phenomena and see that many studios rejected not only this film but many other successful Spielberg ventures. Oddly enough Hollywood insiders have always viewed him as a risk taker. 	This film's success, however, shouldn't have surprised anyone at all. In E.T. we have a wonderfully structured story that seamlessly crosses over from fairy tale to comedy to drama without ever missing a beat. It always keeps you emotionally involved both through the story and with the assistance of the score. 	One of the most impressive things about this film is the dialogue. It is often humorous and insightful. The thing that makes it stand out is how succinct it is and how perfectly adept to the situation. A prime example of this is during the emotional good-bye between E.T. and Elliot. They meet each one points to their heart and says 'Ouch' then they exchange pleas 'Come' and 'Stay.' Four lines of dialogue, four words exchanged between the two of them yet that says it all; can it get any tighter than that? The best part is that it works so brilliantly. The comedic dialogue is just as effective Elliot is asked, 'Did you explain school to him?' and in response Elliot says 'How do you explain school to higher intelligence?' There have been entire films on the subject of how futile public education is and in that one line everything has been said. Another great detail in E.T. is the use of inside jokes. First, we see Elliot introducing E.T. to the characters from Star Wars and later in the Halloween sequence we see an homage to that film as well as to Night of the Living Dead and The Creature from the Black Lagoon. 	One thing that makes E.T. special is that it uses situations that all of us can relate to from our own childhood even if it's only there for a second. There's bickering amongst siblings, the use of comics, adults that just won't listen to what you have to say, Halloween, being caught daydreaming by a teacher and many others. Spielberg implemented enough shared experience that even if we didn't feel that Elliot was a snapshot of our past we could identify enough to get lost in the story. 	What also aids the story a great deal is the almost supernatural connection that E.T. and Elliot form. It's akin to what identical twins are supposed to have according to parapsychologists. The connection of their emotional and physical states leads first to some very comedic moments with Elliot sharing E.T.'s drunkenness and also the magical mimicry of the John Wayne film. Later on it leads to some of the most emotionally wrenching scenes where E.T. and Elliot are sharing an illness. 	Everything is so beautifully set up in this film that you might even stop and consider, 'Hey, didn't that come out of nowhere?' but upon examining the film you'll find there really are no holes in the narrative. An example of this being the bike flying one of the most brilliant moments ever recorded on film. It still catches me off guard but it was set up when E.T. levitated the balls in the kid's room to demonstrate where he came from.	To measure a film's impact it is probably best to look at landscape of the entertainment industry a few years later as opposed to just looking at initial box office returns. In both regards E.T.'s impact was enormous. There was a cheap copy-cat film a couple of years later called Mac and Me along with a very successful television series that took a different angle called ALF. Even scenes in E.T. had an impact, for example, the anti-dissection episode is now another staple in the sitcom book of ideas. 	The reason that this film epitomized Spielberg so well is not the emotional intensity although that has a lot to do with it and it's most definitely not the fact that there are aliens involved. What makes it such a trademark in my mind is that it is such a resounding success. This film is also timeless, it will never, ever, ever seem dated no matter how much magic computers can conjure up you'll never be able to put aside a story as involving and touching as this one, it's a classic and it's quite hard to imagine someone making a film this beautiful one of the best films ever made.",10,1,2,14 August 2002
Casablanca," Pure Entertainment (spoilers)
","In Casablanca what is most noticeable is the way separate filmic elements join to create a whole. Under the supervision of Michael Curtiz all the necessary ingredients to make this film successful come together magically. I use the word successful because that's what the film is. It does what it sets out to do. It's fun to watch and not high art nor the most involving and deeply moving experience in film history but it works. 	 Curtiz's direction deserves to be mentioned first with all the ballyhoo and trumpet-tounged praise this film receives I had never known the name of the man who directed the film. In this film not only does he construct a very well-told visual narrative but he also provide some frames that floored me, most noticeably an establishing shot of The Blue parrot including an actual blue parrot, and the shadow used to establish La Belle Aurore. His insistence on his casting decisions also made the film what it is as a landmark in Hollywood history. Changing any one of the actors would likely have made the studio's prediction of it being a flop-come-true. 	 Humphrey Bogart could not have been better suited for his part. For through most of the film we see Rick Blain as cool and unflinching. Only in the flashback do we see his more emotional and less pragmatic side. Slowly we see revelations he helps the Humgarian girl he also quarrels with Ilsa over their failed love affair. Even in this film we find Bogart in his persona of the heroic loner which we would find in many of his films. 	 In what is probably the best piece of casting was Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. Aesthetically Bergman has one of those faces that was just made to be filmed in black and white. She is luminous. She plays Ilsa to a tee and truly makes the love affair back drop of the film both during the flashback sequence and when she pleads in tears for Rick's assistance. In every film romance both actors have to be equals and suited for one another, this pair is. 	 The secondary players were also crucial. In such a way they can scarcely be called secondary characters. The most artistic part of Casablanca is that Curtiz both in the beginning and towards the end takes us amongst, little vignettes, snatches of the lives of the people who live their temporary existences in this town that's merely a gateway to Lisbon, then America. With the dual story of refugees and the love stories the secondary characters take on even greater importance. Claude Rains, when he's on the screen it's like there's no one else around. His excuse for closing down the caf√© was the only dialogue that stuck in my head after so many years without having watched it. Rains plays his character in such a way that his change of heart at the end is justified and, as written, he is the most complex of all the characters. Peter Lorre, played Ugarte, he was absent through much of the film but Lorre with that voice always leaves an impression with the audience. He also seems to exude a kind of helplessness in this part. Syndey Greenstreet seemed to be the Fat Man out of The Maltese Falcon but in the end he helps his share of people and does a good job also. 	What made itself apparent to me this time as opposed to the first time I saw the film was the omnipresence of propaganda in Casablanca. Propaganda is often regarded as a four-letter word, and that's not always the case but it should always looked at with suspicion. In this film it's handled so intelligently and it's Positive-Propaganda, meaning that it's a call to action rather than a character assassination or anti-something. Rick is told 'Isolationism isn't a practical policy.' He's the only American character of the major figures this is a call to action for the American public to support the US war effort in Europe. The propaganda in this film is so incisive, intelligent and organic to the plot that it shows what a powerful medium film really is. It's interesting to note also that the film was made up of cast and crew mostly from Europe, director Micheal Curtiz, Peter Lorre and Paul Heinreid (Victor Laszlo) were born in the Austro-Hungarian empire, Igrid Bergman was Swedish, Claude Rains and Sydney Greenstreet were English and Colonel Srasser was played by a legend of German cinema Conrad Veidt. 	 What we have in Casablanca is film that can be enjoyed from any angle you look at it. It is a film that will transcend generations for years to come.",7,0,2,31 January 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Zzzzzzz
","I came. I slept. I left. I wasted my time what a piece of garbage. The thing doesn't move at all, it lasts forever, scenes are overly drawn out and several of them are redundant. It took the film about an hour to establish some sort of premise otherwise it was just wasting its time with eye candy and gimmicks. The acting, including Johnny Depp who was great in the first film, was all flat and boring. The grotesque sea creates Davey Jones and his minions lost whatever appeal they had the feeling of repulsion separated from all other emotion isn't effective. The Black Pearl had at least some legs to stand on, however, wobbly. This series followed (or follows I shudder at the thought) a progression of getting progressively worse and longer. The first was good but too long by a half an hour, the second bad and too long by 45 minutes this one was god awful and shouldn't have started in the first place. Orlando Bloom's character doesn't really die which is a joke and I didn't care about anything that happened in it for a second. And the ending, or should I say endings, may be in fact worse than The Return of the King because at least those multiple endings were preceded by a great film. This one was barely watchable. I liked the first Pirates of the Caribbean a lot and felt, due in part by running time, that I wanted to see the story resolve itself though I really could care less. Now I wish I hadn't.",1,44,75,28 May 2007
The Terminator," Provocative though imperfect (Spoilers)
","This was the first time I had seen the original Terminator. While now it seems like it's going to be logistical nightmare it is definitely a film that leaves itself open for a sequel and eventually a third film.	We open with a very 80s fantasy set with spaceships flying shooting lasers at each other and then this huge tank steamrolling over skulls. The background is all blue with nothing distinguishing that it's the sky at all.	We then get a title insert giving us some back-story and/or fore-story telling us of the battle that lead to the world's destroyed state in 2028 and how in the present the true battle will be fought. It was truly a challenge to remember that much such that I could write it down because I hate any of those inserts at the beginning unless their purpose is comedic. I feel that when you're dealing with a visual medium and you have a lot of writing on the screen at the beginning you shouldn't expect anyone to remember it, the exception being those people who went to see Star Wars 55 times as compared to my zero. 	For the first forty minutes of the film it seems as if we're watching two characters making identical moves and are left to wonder if the script was written as half a script copied over with only the names being changed. However, slowly we find out that the Schwarzenegger character is the Terminator and the other person, Reese, who traveled through time, which is also very clouded at the beginning, are working in opposite purposes. 	What was set up by Cameron and Hurd in the beginning is a very interesting misinterpretation of facts. We see the police one deputy played by Lance Henriksen (Pumpkinhead) and the chief who just happens to be African-American (but I'll address that later) about two Sarah Connor's who had been killed. We also witness our main Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) see the TV news bulletin about the first murder which her friends find humorous and see her stunned reaction to the second and see her sitting around in fear this section was probably the best part of her inconsistent performance. 	As a director Cameron didn't seem to be very interested in creating too many intricate frames. There were a few shown during the war scenes where there was a lot of wreckage used as an obstruction and there was also some good framing in the parking garage with the use of wide angle shots. The focus seemed to be on lighting and using the color blue. There are scenes were everything is tinted blue. There also was a lot of use of floodlighting along with mist, fog, smoke and any effect of that sort they could find. This left the color palate was very muted and this lent itself to the somber tone that Cameron was attempting to create in the chases and stalking scenes also when Reese and Sarah were under the bridge for the night.	Story wise, however, there are some very good foreshadowing touches added. One being a waitress friend of Sarah's saying 'In a hundred years who's gonna care.' Where the essence of this film is examining how through time travel these people are attempting to secure the future both looking for drastically different results. Before Sarah ever sees Reese one of her friends is wearing a Jetson's shirt, small yes but any number of shirts could have been chosen and the filmmakers decided to drop some hints. 	Character-wise there is but one character who is worth talking about and that is the Terminator. Schwarzenegger's character is one who is symbolic of what humanity would become of we became overly dependent on computers/machines in that the Terminator itself is a machine with flesh. The Terminator is a film that was released in 1984 the year of Orwell's famous novel took place in and it was also a year where computer was still very new and misunderstood and the concept of Big Brother was still very alive. We see Reese has been branded with a bar code which seems to be both an attack on consumerism and Nazism by combining them in one symbol. While this is not the larger issue that the film deals with it most definitely should be a fact that no Science-Fiction film avoids social commentary in some way. 	The greatest accomplishment of this film is the way in which the Polaroid photograph was introduced in the end. It was an image haunting the story and it seemed to be the one piece of evidence that would prove the veracity of the whole plot to all those involved as if we weren't already willing to believe. The great failure of the film, however, is that Reese is the father of John Connor which was very predictable after they started talking on a more personal level. His death in 1984 makes up for it a bit but it doesn't take away the fact that I had that little voice nagging in the back of my head saying 'Don't be John's father! Don't be John's father! Don't be John's father!' In the end Sarah Conner we sympathize with and she does end up being well drawn out even though when she got 'tough' her dialogue seemed forced and I think Cameron should have re-written the line to make it more believable. The only real problem with characters I had were the African-American characters who all had either walk throughs or supporting roles and seemed to be taken from the text How to Write a Stereotype. All in all The Terminator is a very intriguing and provocative science-fiction film.",8,1,2,14 August 2002
Over the Top," Stallone Trying To Prove Himself
","I remember seeing this movie as a kid and back then I liked it fine. All I recall from the first viewing was Stallone really struggling in one of the arm wrestling matches. I caught it on TV again recently and couldn't recognize it. There was an exchange between Stallone and his son about driving a truck that was pretty interesting. In the story it worked to bond the estranged-genius son with his father but watching it is seemed like Stallone was trying to prove himself to people. As I was watching the beginning I kept thinking to myself 'Isn't this the arm wrestling movie?'. Sure enough arm wrestling was thrown in, in a contrived way and that basically took the movie off into another direction and tried to balance the father son aspect. Watching this movie now was almost unbearable.",3,2,5,25 October 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Excellent!
",I unlie 99.9999% of the planet have not gotten around to seeing the original series. It was something that just never caught my interest until the first Prequel came out. So I figured I might as well watch the films in chronological order.After 'The Phantom Menace' I was largely unimpressed and didn't know what all the Star Wars hype/obsession was about. Now I understand! This film was excellent and undoubtedly the biggest surprise of the year to date.John Williams's 'Love Theme' is perhaps the most beautiful piece of music he's ever composed. This film in no way parallels the first. Many doors are opened. The pacing in the first film was so slow it was painful and there was practically no information about anyone given. Here Anakin is a rounded character and the pace is unrelenting and we're constantly thinking but never bored.This film is thoroughly enjoyable on all levels the two storylines both Obi-Wan's and Anakins are constructed beautifully and converge perfectly. This is a film I willing went back and saw two more times and I cannot wait until the third installment. The table is definitely set for many great events to take place.,10,6,8,22 July 2002
Spider-Man," Am I the only one?
","Who find this to be the most painful moviegoing experience in recent memory? I don't think I found one redeeming piece of filmmaking in this overproduced piece of garbage and it was just torturous to watch. Do I have to be a Spider-man fan to get what all the buzz is about? I doubt it because I had only seen the hackney, corny 60s Batman before the movie came out and that was a great piece of work.Comnparisons to Batman aside this movie cannot stand alone on its own two feet. This film is two-hours of anti-climax without an interesting or even developed character in the lot of them. While Tobey McGuire is a decent actor he's always had a boring screen persona, in fact, I couldn't find a vibrant personality in this film to liven it up. David Koepp, who has written or co-written some exciting films such as Jurassic Park and Panic Room couldn't have come up with a more boring and I'm guessing faithful storyline. There wasn't anything to punch it up or make it more lively. Of course, a slow paced story can be made more interesting and Sam Raimi is also largely to blame even though he's made some great movies in the past this most certainly is not one of them.Even if the story was designed with cliches in the comic book couldn't they have been avoided? I won't even go into them but they're all over the place. Willem DeFoe is also boring and the fights are lame and contrived and there wasn't an original or even a clever move in any of them. It goes without saying the special effects were awful and they go hand in hand with the trite motionless storyline. I don't think I've seen a worse studio film in six years. I didn't have to stand in line to see this one and I sure as hell won't be standing in line to see the next one.",1,0,2,2 August 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Worth a Second Look
",This a hard film to get into because of the long extensive battle scenes. While war films aren't necessarily my favorite genre and it's not the greatest story I ever heard it's certainly a masterfully put together film. There are great moments in this that are Spielberg's trademarks but the handheld camera and the selective omission of sound are truly great at getting you into the insanity and making it a realistic experience. Home video subtracts from the experience and you must find a larger screen if at all possible. 8/10,8,1,2,21 April 2002
Saving Private Ryan," A Waste of Time
",I never finished watching this movie and I don't really care to. I wasn't unsettled or bothered by the opening sequence merely bored. It wasn't compelling merely gory and heavy-handed. It was a reverse tactic to try and get the audience involved in the story and frankly it didn't work for me and as the movie progressed I cared less and less about the story. Boring and overrated. 1/10.,8,1,2,28 January 2002
1941," Hard to Believe It's Spielberg (Spoilers)
","Here is concrete proof that comedy is unquestionably the hardest genre to succeed in. Without trying to get inside Spielberg's head and trying to determine exactly what it was that he was trying to do with this film, one can look at it as is and be left scratching their head. It is at best funny in small patches and most definitely a humongous waste of talent both on and off camera. I applaud Spielberg for not only making a huge departure from his big successes (Close Encounters and Jaws) but also for poking fun at the latter in the opening sequence of the latter film. This stands out as one of the few truly comic sequences throughout a film that is plagued by many difficulties. This film especially pales in retrospect considering that I've laughed much more during his action/adventure and sci-fi films and this film doesn't seem to make any sincere satirical jabs at the paranoia in the United States following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, nor does it really succeed at being a farce. In its better moments, which were few and far between, 1941 is hysterical. More often than not, however, 1941is poorly executed slapstick, ham-handed, off-the-wall nonsense that follows the wrong characters and actors. So that this isn't a complete diatribe there are some wonderful performances to be found here but as I've mentioned above these people make their exit from the film much too early. Probably the best performance in this 'all-star' cast was that of Slim Pickens. He delivered not only some of the best lines of the film but delivered them only as he could with that imitable voice of his. Elisha Cook was also there but that's about all what strikes me as really being odd is how ill-utilized these actors were. Most of the cast was a mish-mash of SCTV and Saturday Night Live stars who really didn't do anything noteworthy. Dan Aykroyd got to do some of his shtick but his performance was undermined by some stupid writing, when towards the end for no reason known to man he went bonkers and exclaimed, 'I'm a bug,' while he had wrapped oranges over his eyes with pantyhose. It got worse though John Candy, one of the funniest people who ever lived was just there for seemingly no reason, it was as if the casting director went amuck knowing that Spielberg could get any actors he wanted and got big names to do meaningless roles. Another under used player was Joseph P. Flaherty who provided the film with one of its best lines following the USO riot ('Maybe in the future we could have some Negroes come in and we'll have a race riot.') was also hardly there. Then there was Belushi, who I've always found overrated, doing an annoying version of the Penguin from Batman. He was occasionally funny in this and in other roles but overall I was unimpressed. The big problem this film had was that it was more likely to lose its audience before tying all the storylines together. The additional factor of having the last 45 minutes of the film being one explosion, crash or pratfall after another didn't help much at all. Another factor that didn't help this film was that on home video (apparently this version is somewhat different than the theatrical release) it is 2 hours long, it's very difficult to do a comedy that lasts more than 90 minutes long. About the only thing that made me realize that this was a Spielberg film was the inclusion of the Dumbo screening, which was both fitting to the story and helped me make it through that part of that performance because it is one of Disney's finer works. The score was also a non-entity and I didn't even think Spielberg worked with John Williams. The writing was also schizophrenic, spotty and unusually unfunny most of the time and I was almost shocked to find that Robert Zemeckis had a hand in writing it. It's as if everyone was embarrassed with the end result so that there were no opening credits only closing ones.",3,0,1,14 August 2002
City of God," Captures Lightning in a bottle
","''Cidade de Deus' captures lightning in a bottle. Like many, if not all of the internationally reknowned Brazilian films of the past decade 'Cidade de Deus shows us a segment of the Brazilian population in near perfect cinematic simulacrum. A story whose structure is indebted to 'Citizen Kane' and is just as intellectually stimulating, this films narrative moves circularly telling the tales of many characters who become the central figures in a 'favela'. Rarely is criminality portrayed in such dimension, there is not one 'no-nonsense, tough as nails, born a jerk will die a jerk in this but. The characterization separates and explains the motivations of each main cast member perfectly. The word circular works also to describe the nature of the story which is one of crime and corruption; it is something that never ends as we all know but the filmmaking is so captivating that we expect a 'happy ends' but love the truth the film shows regardless. The Samba-infused score and  frenetic cinematography work hand in hand to add rhythm and emotion where it is needed but the cold, shocking and gut-wrenching scenes are left as is and work wonderfully. This is a film worth multiple viewings and careful examination and is a rarity a great piece of art that ALSO makes a socio-political statement.",10,0,2,4 February 2003
JFK," A Masterpiece
",There was perhaps no more important film made in the 90s. While many important film either fail in one way or another either as a statement or as a piece of fiction this one excels in all facets. Whether or not you agree with Oliver Stone's theories based on the findings of Jim Marrs and Jim Garrison this film should present enough evidence such that one would be left in doubt as to what happened that day in Dallas. The complex web of conspiracy in this film also goes to prove why some people have been so willing to disbelieve conspiracy for so many years: it was just easier that way. As a drama it also works tremendously well the cutting and inserting of images which Stone used for the first time in his film has not been as effectively used by him since. John Williams's score is emotionally stirring and acts as a call to action. All the acting in this film is stupendous and further adds to the overwhelming impact that this film has. No matter what the next major political subject matter any filmmaker decides to tackle it'll be hard to match 'JFK.',10,3,15,28 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Terrible (Spoilers)
","'The Fellowship of the Ring' was a decent movie that has been overblown completely out of proportion by fans of the books. And I did like it but it's not one of the top movies ever. 'The Two Towers' on the other hand is an overly long and boring film that has nearly ruined my desire to finish the series and pursue the books.This film has so many problems it might not be possible to fit them all here but I will try. The biggest issue is that Peter Jackson, his fellow screenwriters and his editor have gotten way ahead of themselves and have crafted themselves a book on film that moves elliptically and slowly at that. This film screams 'Slave to the Book and I haven't even read it.' The editing problems is what contributes most to the problems of pace in this film we get unnecessary fantasies of the future both of Arwen's and Aragon's. The film amidst is big action sequences is too talky Galadriel gives a huge speech so does Samwise and so much of it is unnecessary. This is where I point to the screenwriters and the editor (for allowing all these pointless traveling shots).'Is this a film? Or a play or a book?' because there's too much talking and too much story and so little of it is interesting.Gollum is another huge problem. When he's not incomprehensible he's annoying. Why should I care at all that he has some form of Middle-Earth Schizophrenia? And all he does is further point out that Frodo is the most flawed character for being too trusting and also leads us to notice that Frodo is the only one constantly in conflict yet he's missing 85% of the time, after the first act and Gandalf is the only one who makes the movie worth watching and he's missing 95% of the time. The rotation of the characters in their own scenes becomes predictable and another hindrance. The Battle at Helm's Deep is interrupted 4 times by the stupid walking tree scenes (If the trees can walk and fight how some get chopped down?). What I found more often than not is that I saw many concepts that I've seen in other fantasy films. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the Bible of fantasy literature but the other films paying homage to it have been far and away better. The score of this film was also overrated in the first film and in this one Howard Shore was trying to make every single moment in the film the most important and most memorable and it never worked. His quasi-Irish quasi-classical score did nothing but bore me to tears. Not only was there a lack of filmic sensibility on the part of the makers of this film but there were story problems like when Gandalf revives the King what is that shot of Saruman falling all about.The actors do their best in this film besides Elijah Wood who seems to be wasting his time playing such a paper-thin character.

The Evil Dead," Best Gore Film Ever? (Spoilers)
","If there was ever a horror film in the gore sub-genre that went for the throat and just wouldn't quit it is unquestionably Evil Dead. This is a film with such pulverizing scenes of blood-letting and death that there's no time to be concerned with much else it just draws you in and you become absolutely enthralled. 	At the beginning we see just enough of these characters to differentiate amongst them. They are sketched out just enough such that we don't hat them for their out and out stupidity, which they never really display, and so that their deaths aren't a relief but sometimes it does come as a pleasant shock. The use of the subjective camera to represent the spirits made this film and absolutely did wonders to add to the atmosphere. The relentless speed and the bowling over of trees on the part of these spirits who never really manifested themselves in their true form made the film what it is. Of course one cannot talk about the cinematography without discussing the score of this film for without it these would have just been cute camera moves. Instead the spirits had their own theme song a tenebrous, loud yet low-pitched thump that struck fear into my heart every time I heard it. 	Another way the film Evil Dead is interesting is that it takes some precepts of film and the horror genre in general and uses them masterfully. First, is the Book of the Dead which may also be known as the Necronomicon which may or may not be a factual text but the point being they implemented it to unleash unknown powers on these characters and it was done tremendously well. The book of the dead is undoubtedly a piece of work that has been sparingly used but here it is a perfect fit and shows these people have at least working knowledge of the works of Lovecraft. In Lovecraft's fiction man's desire to know what they had absolutely no hope of understanding always lead to his downfall a similar parallel can be drawn to this film. Secondly, this film mastered the use of the subjective camera as the villain which was initiated with It's Alive! And made famous by Jaws, after Evil Dead it would be foolishness for someone to try and rely so heavily on it because it just wouldn't work as well. Third, there is the great use of possession in this film which is no doubt inspired by The Exorcist and comes close to reproducing an equally effective result along that line. 	Some audiences may look back on this film which is now 20 years old and think it looks dated but they can't argue with the fact that it works. I happen to think that the special effects are great especially for when they are made. Claymation or Stop-Motion Animation is a great technique and truly a lost art. Granted it is very difficult to film but the results are great especially with Evil Dead because the clay and whatever other materials they chose to throw in their alongside the oatmeal just added the extra grotesque touch the film need. I think it was just wonderful! 	There is a great debate between people who are proponents of Night of the Living Dead and Evil Dead. I think all the arguing is futile. Both of these films are their own unique kind of beast and they're both beautiful in their own way. Enjoy both these films for what they are and the debate should end and everyone busting a vein trying to win the argument should just shut up.",10,0,0,14 August 2002
Love Actually," One of the Year's Very Best
","Love Actually is one of those brilliant experiences where a trailer sends a jolt through your soul and whets your appetite. You anticipate the film hopelessly counting down the days but trying not to think about because you're afraid you'll hype the film to death.Then you see it and are dumbfounded. They caught lighting in a bottle. You get what the trailer promised and more.This film has no pretensions and doesn't do those stupid reversals most romantic comedies do when the result of the story is pre-ordained. This film is no more or no less a tale of people seeking to find happiness in their lives and to share that with someone else. It's a romantic comedy for real people. And for those people in the clich√© of ¬ëpeople who hate romantic comedies'This film makes you glad to be alive. It's cinematic bliss. If you're looking for a purely visceral, emotional experience with a lot of laughs you should definitely see this film.All the storylines do not detract from the emotion or the narrative structure. Upon first viewing pieces of each characters tale may seem as if they're spread too fart apart. And you find you want to get back to the Prime Minister's story or Jamie's but by the end you love all the stories. And the pay off is great.It's one of the year's very best.",10,0,2,22 November 2003
Carrie," Intense Film That Mirrors The Novel
","This is the work that made Stephen King a household name, however, when I read that he had thrown out the manuscript unfinished in disgust I was not surprised. I love King's work for more reasons than I can list here but I always felt that 'Carrie' was like a hiccup (something coming out of nowhere that isn't usually what he later dealt with; or had dealt with in his short stories previously) in his chain of tales which, ironically launched his career rather than having occurred in the middle. The film directed by De Palma is well adapted and directed. While it is not scary I would say it is extremely tense. The conflict between Carrie and her domineering religious zealot of a mother are truly brought to life well. I thought it was interesting and truly a rare adaption which lives up to the material it is based on. It isn't perfectly done but there are many, many, many worse horror/supernatural films out there.",8,0,0,22 October 2001
Signs," Signs of Things to Come? (SPOILERS)
","I walked out of Signs in awe of how unimpressed I was. As much as I like Night's visual sensitivities I just could not walk away from this movie liking it no matter how much I tried. It's as if he's gotten formulas with a concept that didn't have much lasting power anyway. The Sixth Sense was a great film and so was Wide Awake. One made hundreds of millions of dollars the other barely made ten and it seems as if that has defined his style. While in his last two films the slow pacing has been somewhat to a benefit it absolutely hurts this movie that felt like it went on much longer than it had to. The movie is very strong at the beginning we get firmly established and differentiated characters and a series of escalatingly eerie events. The image of Morgan holding the baby monitor up to the sky is fantastic but that seems to be the last moment of greatness in this film after that it thuds. The things that worked in The Sixth Sense didn't work here while Mel Gibson did a very good job in this film the moments where he tells his children about when they were born were absolutely contrived. While the lack of visual contact with the aliens in the beginning is justifiable the lack of confrontation with them in the cellar itself is rather self-defeating. And thus, lends a certain feeling of anti-climax to the actual climax which by the way takes its jolly good time showing up. The casual identification of their motivation after the fact and also that we don't see them flee hurts the film. One of the best visual moments was spoken and it wasn't a case of the dialogue was so great showing it would hurt. The 'Bird incident' was quite interesting. Ultimately Signs is a collection of interesting and creepy incident that have no idea where they want to end up. The climax which also included a montage like Shyamalan's last two films, packs no added wallop. While I didn't much care for Unbreakable the ending of that film does also provide an amazing shock. In this film, however, the end does not explain the whole of the film. Which is not usually a problem but certain critics who shall remain nameless said there was a quote 'You've got to be kidding me end.' There wasn't! Shyamalan's profound writing about how maybe there were 'No coincidences' was absolutely wrecked by the fact that he had to justify a logical ending with such flashes. I overheard someone say on the way out of the theater that 'He's the King of Fancy Endings.' This ending wasn't fancy at all and it like the film was a letdown. Also this film unlike the other two leaves many questions unanswered which defeats the style of ending and the film as a whole. All in all M. Night Shyamalan is very talented filmmaker who has to break out of this pattern. The beginning of his career is rather akin to Spielberg's with an early film that weren't much of a success and then a world wide breakout. They also stayed in the same genre for a while (Night's really in a subgenre). It truly is time for a change as far as his choice of subject matter goes, he's a very talented filmmaker and I will go see his next film I just hope he takes a new approach.",Null,2,3,13 August 2002
Am√©lie," Great to a point, but slips (Spoilers)
","Unlike Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Cit√© de enfants perdu which never has a period, or moment of greatness, Am√©lie manages to be great and wonderfully inventive for about the first half hour until Bretodeau gets his box back. After that it's as if we've watched the origin story of a super hero and then watch her go about her daily routine (changing from Clark Kent to Superman, so to speak). The film then hits a structural snag, whereas, now Amelie has satisfied the desire of one man she goes off and tries to help everyone almost at once and we are told of these incidents simultaneously. The film had its greatest grip on me when we were focused on one story, there would've been nothing wrong with vignettes after all it was good enough for Truffaut in Small Change. 	Amelie begins wonderfully, with voice-over narration of her early life which the French seem to be masters at, the best example of voice-over being in Leolo a Quebecois film. Her childhood full of its strange events come across as hilarious whereas other cultures might have botched them making them distasteful, the death of her mother being a perfect example. The quirky humor is about the only thing that never leaves the film from the ticket taker who now punches holes in plants, the stuffed dog, the traveling gnome etc. When Bredoteau finds his box we flashback to what memories those items held for him in what are truly beautiful moments of the film. This is my moment of highest involvement, that sequence was a pinnacle which the narrative never achieved again. 	Part of the problem is the predictability the film later runs into. I'm terrible at guessing the ends of movie but once we were introduced to Nino and told of his past I knew that he and Amelie would end up together. So obviously, it was nerve-wracking and annoying that she was so painfully shy and prolonged the movie unnecessarily. Then there's the almost American complication in the relationship between Georgette and the bar drunk by her talking to Nino were so uncalled for. Then we also have the 'Glass Man' and Amelie pondering Renoir's painting. While in the beginning it's commenting on Amelie is subtle it becomes more and more overt as the film moves on. The there are Jeunet's shots of Amelie smiling to extract her cuteness for some affect and frankly she's not all that cute and the shots are inorganic which is even worse. The special effects also eventually become pedantic when the key in her pocket shines, it makes me wonder what kind of film this would've turned into if Jeunet had been given a Lucas-like amount of special effect allowances in the budget. 	The cinematography in this film is quite spectacular but in certain instances the effects downplay what they have been able to do with the camera. The change in structure of this film ultimately creates a domino effect. While I can't re-write the film I wonder if I would be nit-picking so much if there hadn't been such a shift in the way the story was told. In the end Amelie is an enjoyable experience that may just have indulged its premise a bit too much-6/10.",6,8,15,31 January 2003
The Sixth Sense," Best Film of 1999
",This is an amazing movie. I haven't really thought about it yet but may be in my top ten all time. it is absolutely brilliant. every little piece of the plot is a puzzle that is constructed with hitchcockian brilliance. I've followed Haley Joel's career since his sitcom days and even i was amazed by him in this movie. he was scared he made you forget you were watching a movie and made you live it. Shyamalan provides an excellent and gut wrenching story which shows his range when you consider his prior film was 'Wide Awake' which was a beautiful tear jerker of a film. this movie also has it's moments. Toni Colette is absolutely amazing and Bruce Willis gives the performance of his career. you can try to find a flaw in this movie but you won't IT'S ONE OF THE BEST EVER,10,0,0,19 April 2000
Gangs of New York," Doppelg√É¬§ngers of New York
","Oh Marty Scorcese!Well, I finally saw it and I must say the word I came away with was: empty. Now the movie had a lot going for it and for the first hour I was hooked but there were several things that ended up working against it:Daniel Day-Lewis's performance while technically excellent was dry and left me wanting for emotion. This was a man who exemplified the very core of everything I hate yet somehow I didn't hate him. More often than not he reminded me of Dustin Hoffman in 'Hook,' although Hoffman was meaner.Leonardo DiCaprio's performance ,however, was very raw and emotionally charged despite his wavering Irish accent. His scenes are some of the more impressive along with Henry Thomas' amazing turn, he only continues to grow as an actor and is truly underrated.Where Gangs of New York suffers is towards the end. First, off it loses momentum by taking 30 to 40 minutes too long to end.The backdrop of the draft riots get too involved in the film and nearly ruin it.The confrontation between Amsterdam and Cutting is too short.Then there's a corny closing images meaning the graves with bad CGI, and this cost 97 million dollars?While the opening sequence of the film is fantastic and is what keeps you going. Scorcese leaves you wanting in the action sequences. Only showing you effect and not cause. If it were not for the importance of the scene and the good cutting it would've been a waste. He improves some in the  middle but at the end shows but a little.While it's one of those films you know could end in 5 minutes. Gangs of New York is a film that could've been great that missed the mark. 6/10",6,0,0,27 December 2002
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The best of the Series (Spoilers)
","'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is better than the original for many reasons. It's a film that doesn't just hit you but involves you more in the story line. Part of why it is easier to go along for that ride is because you've been prepared by the previous film to expect certain things despite this there are also some new and creative elements in this movie which separates it. 	In the beginning we get what is seemingly an unattached scene. In this one we flash back to when Indiana was a child, played by River Phoenix. His chase for a crucifix establishes a few things. First, it establishes that this will be yet another religious relic that they will be in search of. Second, and more importantly it defines who his arch enemy is. We also get glimpses into the character's psyche whereas previously he was a very external being we get this just through seeing past events. Young Indiana picks up a whip for the first time when coming face to face with a lion. Then we see the interplay between him and his father and can see how the boy doesn't understand how his father could've dedicated his whole life to these adventures especially in his mother's absence. 	When Indiana is pegged for a mission the discussion of it is much more confrontational than in the first. There is a lot more give and take. Indy shows part of his disbelief in the grail while we are told the history in much more detail than we were in the first film when Indy was in search of the Ark of the Covenant. He's very reluctant to go but is urged on by the fact that his father has been kidnapped this after him mysteriously receiving his father's Grail Diary. 	This film is full of riddles and mind games which makes it that much more entertaining. He arrives in the library that was a converted church and with Ilsa Schneider () they have to solve a puzzle of where the catacombs are. They look for the Roman numerals but can't find one. Indy on a hunch runs up the stairs and sees the X all across the floor. Down in the dark with all the rats Spielberg reaches a moment of terror with all the rats crawling along. 	Another great touch this film had was in keeping with the traditions of the 40s and 50s in that we could never quite figure anyone out. I was genuinely surprised by Ilsa both when we were shown she was a Nazi and then later when she mislead her leader in the choosing which grail was the Holy Grail. That coupled with her femme fatale status of seducing men only to ruin them made her seem like something out of a film noir. 	The tandem of Sean Connery and Harrison Ford worked very well together. Their timing is great especially when they were both tied up and were trying to talk to one another face to face and their heads kept swiveling side to side. Their relationship dominated significant portions of the film and they exchanged great moves and funny lines constantly. On the zeppelin the ball was in Junior's court and stayed their as they escaped but in the plane Senior had to shoot the machine gun and shot the tail off and was hysterical in denying it. Then on the beach he got the seagulls flapping to knock down the second plane. 	What I also found quite interesting in both this film and the first although it was more prominent in this film was the involvement and use of the Nazis. It was interesting for me because I had believed Spielberg had never addressed any aspect of the war in any sort of way until making 'Schindler's List.' Having established the Nazi interest in the occult and in conquering religion I think that's why there was more Nazi involvement here. It also allowed for a hilarious scene where Ford dressed as a Nazi who comes face to face with Adolf Hitler who instead of burning the grail diaries signs it for him and moves on from there. 	For me the only stumbling blocks to make this a completely fulfilling experience cam towards the end. When Indiana must spell out the name of God, Jehovah was not the name that immediately came to mind it was, in fact, Yahweh which was the original Hebrew word which people did not speak and when it was written there were no vowels. However, it was later replaced by Jehovah. This is no fault on the filmmakers part its just a slight technicality that some may or may not pick up on. 	This time, however, I was prepared for what would happen to the man who drank from the false grail because it was foreshadowed and also because it closely resembled the end of the first film. My one question lay in the fact that it seemed to me from the way the situation was explained that Indiana would now be immortalized and would have to guard the grail or his father would maybe perhaps they escape that by trying to remove the grail it did get a little hazy in that regard but nonetheless it was quite an enjoyable film that blended many diverse elements to make for a really entertaining ride.",10,1,1,14 August 2002
