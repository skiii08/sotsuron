The Avengers," Fantastic Movie. Go see it!!!!!!!
","As I reflect on my experience tonight watching the Avengers, one word comes to mind: Awesome. The movie was simply awesome. The action scenes were the best I've seen in any recent movie, and the comedy was excellent. It seems that super-hero movies these days have become parodies of themselves. And for that reason the movies are even better. The audience and the actors are all in on the jokes together, and for that the audience feels delighted and laughs. To make the greatness of this movie more relatable, here is a list of things that are equal to the movie in excellence: 1. Donald Trump's commitment in a losing battle to prove Obama African 2. Obama's actually being American 3. Women's sports 4. Bashing Women's sports 5. Powerful shower-heads 6. shower-head 7. The lifespan of the Nintendo 64 8. The triple-chinned woman working at Burger King who wears a 'Grumpy' shirt to let the customers know she is grumpy. The woman is, in fact, grumpy. You know what you're getting yourself into. 9. That dude's facial hair in the Hunger Games 10. Having your cake and eating it, too. And then going to brag to your friends about the cake that you got to eat but they didn't get to eat. And then they tell you that all of those carbs and sugar will go to your hips and butt. But you don't believe them. And you don't really care. Because that cake was excellent. I hope you could relate to at least one of these excellent things to see just how great this movie really is. It's like a mix between Fergie and Jesus. Not only will you enjoy this movie, but The Avengers will also solve many issues: 1. Relationship problems 2. Erectile dysfunction Those are actually all the problems this movie will solve. In conclusion, this movie was awesome. And, spoiler alert, Scarlett Johansson is gorgeous in this film. Much love, James Harden.P.S Selena Gomez, if you are reading this, cool.",10,2,6,4 May 2012
