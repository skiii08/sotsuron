3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Yuma Comparison
","3:10 to Yuma ComparisonIn the case of the 1957 version of 3:10 to Yuma based off Elmore Leonard's short story, and a half a century later, a remake of the movie, it is interesting to see how the difference between the three versions reflect changes. Indeed, the 3:10 to Yuma films not only showed the differences of Hollywood, but also compared our modern day culture to that of 1957.The written short story of 3:10 to Yuma by Elmore Leonard was the first to be published in 1953. The short story is virtually the bare minimum compared to the film. There are ideas portrayed in the film that are not represented in the story at all. For example, the beginning scenes were added in the 1957 movie was not in the short story. The short story jumps right to after Ben Wade is taken prisoner and they ride to Contention city. The audience only learns about what happened prior to this event in the film. Another element that was changed from the short story to film was the character names. Paul Scallen plays the equivalent role of Dan Evans while Jim Kidd is also known as Ben Wade. Amongst the main characters, the supporting characters are also introduced under a different identity. The 1957 film based off the short story is a modest film. In this manner, it is an 88 minute film that delivers a relatively simple story in a straightforward fashion. It is mainly conceived as a physiological drama in which Ben Wade interacts with Dan Evans as the time counts down to take Ben to the train that will send him behind bars. As the first film to be based off the story, it provides the audience with a minimum amount of content to understand the story, yet does not include as much content as the 2007 remake. There are some additions to the film in the remake and there is virtually no content left out from the 1957 film.The 2007 3:10 to Yuma is stunning in both its similarities and differences. It follows the same basic storyline, even using many of the same dialogue as the first. However, it's a whole different film in which it's based more off the action, is a third longer than the first, has a twisted ending, and of course keeping up to date, it is crammed with many details, conflict, and bloodshed. There are many added scenes to the movie to add to the action. The Indian gunfight and the escape from the town where Ben Wade is captured are the two best examples of action-packed scenes that did not appear in the 1957 version. Furthermore, it can also be thought of as more detail to the remake. For instance, Ben Wade defends Dan and his men from the Indians and kills them while they are hiding. Dan later says to Wade that he's not all bad inside him. He denies it and says that he only killed the Indians to defend himself. It's a perfect example of how the added scenes to the movie can be played upon later in the film to display the significance of the new scene. Another small detail that is added is that the audience finds a hidden characteristic of Ben that he has an artistic side. In one of the opening scenes, he leaves a sketch of a bird he saw on a branch hung on a tree. Again, he sketches a picture of the bartender that he meets.There were many elements that were retained, modified or expanded upon between the interim of the short story to the remake of the film. But whatever the reasons, 3:10 to Yuma is exciting, looks great and is well acted in both films. It is clear evidence that the death of a Hollywood western has yet to occur.",9,0,0,24 September 2007
