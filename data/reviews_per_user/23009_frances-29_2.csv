Requiem for a Dream," depressed and beautiful
","how can a movie about drugs be original? well..this one is because the characters are punished in the end..especially Jared leto's another trainspottin? hmm..i don't think so..cause first of all this is a us product..and secondly..the music what do they have in common? a great actor. Ewan McGregor and Jared leto..let's say this is his best performance. cause i don't notice him at all in fight club (norton was just too overwhelming). what does requiem have and trainspotting lacks? another three brilliant actors..starting with Ellen Burstyn..who is absolutely incredible..her portrayal of the woman obsessed of losin weight and this way fitting a dream, the dream of a perfect life..is just amazing..Marlon Wayans fits in perfectly..and Jennifer Connelly selling her body for drugs just make you want scream..a great cast Darren Aronofsky's fourth movie..and after this one he's taken a break..can't wait to see his next project another plus..music..i've never heard such a depressing and disturbing music (would it win the prize for the saddest music in the world? Guy Maddin should decide)..listen to it before going to a funeral and it'll make you look sad but feel good",10,0,1,6 June 2005
Garden State," the best of Zach Braff
","I saw Zach in 'Scrubs' and he did not impress me at all..just another actor..but Garden State is a different thing. I still can not believe that he is so young and moreover that he wrote something not at all cheesy, that he was able to avoid almost all the clich√©..that's impressing for someone who is not Clint Eastwood. and I believe this is his first attempt.. as an actor..Zach can actually play! and not the Hollywood way. he IS the actor that accidentally killed his mother and that has spent his life on drugs. he is real to the audience.. Natalie impressed me in Leon..shocked me in Closer..and now Garden State..two movies in such a short period of time..in Closer you want her badly..in Garden you want to love her in a pure way, well more or less..she really has transformed this part, just as she did with her career, into something you try to relate to..and more than once you can relate not only to her but to the entire movie. another plus: music..cold-play as soundtrack..that should impress anyone..every song marks an essential moment..I think it's one of the best soundtracks I've heard lately..",10,0,1,27 April 2005
