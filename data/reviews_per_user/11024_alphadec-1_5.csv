Blade Runner 2049," not even close
","In 1982 I was in the cinama and watched a groundbreaking movie 'Blade Runner'.So today I watched Bladerunner 2049, but what have i seen. ?
I dont get the feeling this is blade runner, the music from Vangelis is not even there. (why did not vangelis get this job anyway) The story if there is one is so full of holes that it is beyond repair.So why is movie like this made. ?
To me the only it does is destroy the legacy of a master pice orginal movie from 1982.The onlything this film got is lots of very nice pictures by Roger Deakins and thats what keeps this movie alive.No regreet this movie wish I just watched the orginal movie again.",5,4,7,17 March 2018
Ready Player One," Steven Speilberg, who ?
","Is there more then one steven Speilberg. ?
Noway that Steven Speilberg that made Jaws, Raidars of the lost ark, has had anyhting todo with this pile of junk!.I think it must be Steven Speilbergs assitans or tranee who put his name on this.I just spent 2 hours 20 min watch this crap, sorry didn't know there was a book. How can someoe write somethng like this, this is what tv pumps out a million of each day.This movie is 85% pure CGI! nothing else I know the Steven Speilberg I love has a vision and he hates CGI!, and this movie is just pile on pile with CGICGI = Computer Generated ImageryI am chocked hope I never will see steven speilbergs name on anyhting like this again.",3,0,2,13 July 2018
Man of Steel," Man of steel AKA Superman the movie
","How do I start this..... ;) I have been a superman fan all my life did grow up with the comic and superman movies from 1979, etc. A movie that had it all did follow the original story.Man of steel this is a movie I have been waiting for and since Z.Snider was to direct I had hoped for something exciting a new touch...After watching the first 20 min I see that this is a attempt at a remake of 'superman the movie', I though oh my god this will not go good since there is no way anyone can improve on that movie.After 15-20 movies I see where this was going a CGI kal-el oh my...... and not very good done either. We are on krypton nothing like anything like the original comic or any movies before.From here there is no story the next 2 hours is just sequences of action no story line to follow no plot just a endless line of CGI and more cgi.When comes to acting..... well there is no acting but one thing that I find strange is what are H.Cavill doing so much better then Rooth, why was he replacedMovies studios claim that we the fans are destroying movies with pirating movies (they claim). So what can we say about movie studios that is destroying one franchise after another. Just because they have bought a right to make a movie does not have the right to wreck everything they have bought the rights to under the terms of 'artistic freedom'.I think the fault with movie makers these days is that it is too many directors with Zero talent and too much use of cgi and scripting is something they find on internet. Hollywood need to change fast or the movie industry will be gone.",1,10,17,26 October 2013
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I love QT but this movie......
","I love QT but this movie is so bad I dont have words.As a movie this film is pure junk but if u watch it like a window into 60ties 70ties hollywood then you might like it, but as a movie it fails in everyhthing.I am hugly dispointed.",2,2,4,25 November 2019
Django Unchained," Django or not
","I am a huge fan of QT. Since 'Kill bill' a movie I believe is the best action movie ever made. After that movie I think QT has lost much for his talent on movies that does not lives up to Kill Bill.To me Django is a movie with Franco Nero a silent cowboy that comes and cleans up.So after been watching 10 min of Django Unchained you say to you self 'What the hell is this' where the story starts in the south where a slave is set free!, WTF!.So Quintin Tarrantino WHAT IN THE HELL HAVE U DONE TO DJANGO. ?? I am very disappointed",2,3,7,29 May 2013
