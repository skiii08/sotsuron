Walk the Line," walk the line - not
","i just had a 3 hour movie inflicted on me - called 'walk the line' .. a johnny cash biopic ..while really well photographed, well acted and competently sung, after three hours you get up and leave the cinema, thinking: 'there IS something missing here' this movie leaves you without ANY emotional involvement - NONE whatsoever ... thats what is missing here ...even if had just filmed the encyclopedia entry on johnny cash this would have had more emotional impact so - unless your a die-hard, dyed in the wool, 100% hardcore johnny cash fan - don t walk the linethis is a showcase for the fact that it is not enough to have good actors - you also need a good story ..",1,34,73,12 February 2006
