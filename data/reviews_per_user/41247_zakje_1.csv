Requiem for a Dream," i got emotional!
","in the past year, 2 maybe, i've never got really touched by a movie, i'm movie-addict for abuot 3 years now, and have seen a lot of 'touching drama's' but this one breaks everybody. you get confused during the movie about the thoughts of all persons about each other, in th end it appears they actually don't really care ... they they just we're destroyed by the drugs, and lost a lot(dignity, arm, and so on) and go live on without each other.i just recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see a nearly perfect movie, the technical aspects as well as the story and the characters. it even touched me!",10,0,0,15 January 2003
