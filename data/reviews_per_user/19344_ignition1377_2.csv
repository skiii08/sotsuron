Blade Runner 2049," not what I expected.
","I've bought the first blade runner in every possible form of media. Whereas it was VHS, Cds, Streaming.. and watched it countless times. not obsessed but is within my 5 fav movies of all times alongside Platoon , Dune ...
I was looking forward the sequel although reluctant to see it with Jared Letto and Gosling in it , nothing against Gosling, but Letto can kill a Picasso with his sight. 
I was very impressed with the artistic director of the movie, editing and production is very very good I would say 10/10 ... but ! 
Rachael ' copy ' was so badly done I almost turn off the movie. Which studio/ Special effects company did this? was the budget so low ? Really ? This was one of the worse features of the movie 
Second bad feature... the movie seems to end leaving a space for another sequel This is a Bad move as the characters do not end having a proper closure. 
Third bad feature: Letto should not be in it .. period. Gosling featured or mirrored as Batty ? Nah , why did they try to do this anyway ? His character left a taste of Will Smith 'I robot ' instead of Batty's , perhaps the character they wanted Gosling to be linked with. And finally Harrison Ford, a shadow of his former self hardly encompassing and fitting within his star winning role. No ! And three hours? Really ? I was waiting for the ziing it ! and never came. Final Verdict: Will not watch again ... the first movie is disadvantaged by all the special effects of the now but has star quality .",4,3,6,21 March 2018
The Danish Girl," Beautiful Movie Superb acting
","Watched with daughter after reading a short summary of Lili and Gerda. Amazing . This movie captivates the light and atmosphere of a time where post impressionism painted life as the movie depicts throughout its incredibly beautiful scenes, clothes and landscape shots. I could see through Renoir and Degas works as well as Klint. Lili's character story is portrayed in a delicate manner, showing enough detail for the viewer to understand the difficulties of two individuals with more avant garde than some people today . fortunately for the pair , they lived among the wealthy and arty crowd that could tolerate such scandal . The movie is a reminder of our limited attitudes to gender diversity which by the way , have only been endorsed in the Western world for less than a century. It tells a story of two people that truly loved each other and although trapped on the wrong time, they opened the path for many to freedom.",10,0,7,6 January 2016
