The Legend of Bagger Vance," A Tin Cup wanna be
","Well maybe this will encourage Will Smith to go back and make high energy action movies using quick witted humor (so there is a silver lining to the movie).  I thought Will, Matt, and Charlize did an excellent job as usual so I'm going to have to blame this one on Robert Redford.  The movie just seemed slapped together, slow, and very over dramatic.  I guess the script was a little weak and had too many underdeveloped stories but still Robert Redford produced the movie so I guess he's not off the hook there either. The movie gets a big fat Phi and the only thing that could save it would be a hot date to distract you.",4,0,1,26 October 2000
