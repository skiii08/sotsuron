National Treasure: Book of Secrets," I'm going to kidnap the president
","CAUTION: THIS REPORT CONTAINS MANY MANY SPOILERSSetting: Paris, France Event: Cage makes friends with some cops within 2 minutes of conversation. Cops just happen to use the word 'resolute' to translate. Cage figures out a riddle that has been unsolved for hundreds of years within 2 seconds. His now best friend French cops offers Cage a ride to London.Setting: London Event: Cage engages in a high speed car chase destroying everything possible along the way.Setting: Mt. Rushmore Event: Cage kidnaps the president; the president then proceeds to hijack a ride back the white house.Setting: white house Event: Cage by the divine will of the gods, gets easy access to the oval office, then proceeds to rummage through the drawers. Are we getting the point here? This movie just borders on insanity. You can't just go to foreign countries and start destroying everything and really, there's something really messed up if you can kidnap the president that easily.",5,1,2,28 December 2007
Cloverfield," made me a little nauseous...
","Overall, excellent. It was a breath of freshness in its documentary style. the camcorder effect was very effective in capturing the chaos, but i'd have to say, it made me a little sick. I would recommend perhaps sitting towards the back of the theater. I think the monster should have made its debut a little earlier in the movie, because after the first 45 minutes, i was thinking 'they're never going to show us anything, and just leave everything ambiguous.' even when we do finally see the monster, it's a little hazy, and the camera moves around too much for you to get a good look. but i give credit to the spiders that attack and eat people. I would also have to ask, why are so many movies being made about the fall of New York? just something to think about.",8,1,4,21 January 2008
