Black Swan," It got 8 star rating on IMDB maybe because of Lesbian sex.
","Lesbian sex is the only good thing about this movie. Everything else is crap.
They have destroyed the image of Ballet Dancer across the globe. Even though no one gives a rat ass to any Dancer in particular. But, it's being too harsh on them. This movie was not entertaining at all.",1,2,8,14 June 2018
Changeling," I just find it too pathetic of a movie.
","The atmosphere this movie create is very bad for the story they are trying to tell. The color contrast is very dull. The choice of music is off. The pacing of the story is bad. The progression of the story is very slow. So, over all it's just pathetic.",Null,1,10,15 June 2018
Wind River," Few good dialoges, that's it.
","Yes, their is crime but no mystery. And none Drama to be found in this movie. Just snow. Not even river. So, a girl is raped and then she died. And I got to know that their is no statistical data available for the cases related to native American women who went missing. But, come on don't add mystery to the genre. When their is none. And the background music used to create atmosphere for the movie sucks. And that is my review for this movie.",Null,1,4,16 June 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," OK, movie.
","It is not funny. That is all I have against this movie. But, it seem like it tries very hard to be Funny. Comedy is quite risky. If it works, Their is a blast. But, when it doesn't it totally sucks dead air. That is what happen with Spider man. But, the suit was nice. And Every thing else was OK. In the end Captain America summarized the film. By asking the audience that. How does it feel like to have waited so long for something so Awful?Well it certainly doesn't feel that good.",Null,1,3,28 September 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," It's like they perfectly animated the comic book.
","It was an interesting watch.
Specially the Japanese version.",8,1,2,26 February 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Quantum Time Travel stuff
","It is more of a recap of previous Marvel film. It seems to be shot across all the previous film. The thing is, I really dislike the word 'Quantum' after watching the last ant man film. But Avengers Endgame put the last nail in the coffin.",1,59,135,25 April 2019
Black Panther," This filth of a movie.
",This movie sucks. I think this film is a mockery of tribal people of Africa. They just keep vomiting the word technology like a Catholic priest.,Null,11,21,29 April 2018
Incredibles 2," Classic Milking of the Classic.
","If you don't have Interesting story to tell then just start releasing part 2,3,4 etc.
They didn't add anything of value to the original. It was such a drag. The story was for 4 year olds Awe about. Just put some thought into making movies. What were you thinking this was just lazy writing on your part.",Null,115,209,21 June 2018
13 Hours," Good enough movie about men shooting one another.
","The thing is I am not American. So, the line American life are at stakes will not produce a strong enough emotional reaction from me.This is a true story.My friend there are just bullet firing. Where is the so called story.OK, so even if this is true.This is a boring movie.Common you just add text to the movie from the beginning.This is not how you engage your audience.I would have given it 3/10. But one extra star because it is true.But still it is boring.But yes this movie is for American.But even if I was American. My rating would have been the same.",Null,3,16,6 June 2017
