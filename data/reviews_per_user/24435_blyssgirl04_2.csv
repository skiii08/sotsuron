Resident Evil: Afterlife," HORRIBLE even by Resident Evil standards
","Okay, I am usually very forgiving when it comes to zombie movies, and Resident Evil movies. I know it is a computer game, I love computer game based movies. I love zombie movies. I really liked the last three resident evil movies (the third not quite as much, but you get my drift).I actually wanted to leave this movie after the first 10 minutes, and I NEVER want to leave movies - I am serious, and I have seen a lot of movies. This wasn't even funny-bad, this was horrible bad. I should have waited to download this and laugh AT it while drunk with friends.Critiques (some spoilers) - The half-ass ed matrix-wannabe fight scenes with 'crap bullet time' effects - The bad guy who looks like a thick version of Carlisle from Twilight (not a good thing) - The million Alices and Alice's 'super powers' are neutralized within the first 10 minutes - The first 10 minutes with tons of Alices is just f*ing ridiculous - All the characters after it are boring, not memorable, die off really quick anyway - All the bad guys, super zombies, special powers etc have absolutely no explanation - not even a single line like 'Umbrella was experimenting and came up with this freak that kind of reeks of Pyramid Head + Scarecrow.' - The other movies, while good in general, deserve Oscars compared to this movie - The effects are not good, they're the crappy semi-blurred CG - The cliff hanger isn't good, and leaves off with a pseudo-'The Island' everyone in white jumpsuits is freeeee cheesiness. - A lot of the zombies have that split-mouth open effect made popular by Blade 2 and Blade 3 - total rip off, and not well done in this movie.I should not have wasted an hour and a half of my life on this movie. Or the money. Do yourselves a favor and wait for it on Netflix, or borrow it.",1,18,34,11 September 2010
The Matrix Reloaded," Amazing Movie
","As an avid Matrix fan since the movie first came out, I naturally went to see this movie.  I must say that it is now at the very top of my list of 'Movies I Will Lose Count of How Many Times I Have Watched Them'.  It was a great movie, and was not the least bit confusing. For those that DID think it was confusing, you have to ask yourself how well you understood the first movie - the second one isn't geared towards newcomers.  Also, you need to know what to look for and get used more to the Wachowski's style. The effects were really really good, I saw the movie in a prescreening at 7:00 on Wednesday with the VFX company; and though some say many of the scenes were long or unnecessary, I think they worked very well.  The ending I found was very satisfying and they chose a very good place to have a cliffhanger.  Any earlier and it would have driven the average moviegoer insane.  The plot was well-developed and it is definitely a good follow-up of the first Matrix.",10,0,0,18 May 2003
