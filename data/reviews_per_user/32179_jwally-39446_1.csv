Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," WOOOOOOOOOOW
","This movie was the best insert in the Star Wars series. I feel the fight scene between Harry Potter and Padame was truly inspiring, showing the struggle between the genders and the sciences. Also the crossover using a diamond sword from Terraria and the Omega skin from Season 4.",10,2,7,6 March 2020
