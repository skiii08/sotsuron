The Blair Witch Project," Time Better spent
","Perhaps the most pretentious movie I've ever seen.The pseudo documentary look is annoying. The female has a voice like chalk on a blackboard. It would have made a very good half hour episode of TWILIGHT ZONE, but one and a half hours? What a waste of time.This film should be lost in the woods.",1,1,4,4 August 1999
