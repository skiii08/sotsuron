Blade Runner 2049," The Power of Hollywood
","Bladerunner 2049 is a work of art in every sense of the word, and it will stand alone as one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. The fact that it happens to be a sequel makes the achievement even sweeter. The film is stunningly beautiful, and the score left a mark on me I cannot shake. The film speaks to the power of the human spirit in a way I've never before experienced. It reminds us how special it is to be human, to have a conscience, and to love, even when these things are the source of so much pain and suffering.Hats off to the filmmakers. If mankind can make films of this magnitude truly anything is possible. This is Hollywood at its very best.",10,3,12,30 October 2017
