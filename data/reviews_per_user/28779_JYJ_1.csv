Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Difficult Film For George Lucas
","Much was expected of this movie when it came out and when that happens, most people will be disapointed.  As for this film it was very difficult to make for Lucas in my opinion.  I tought it was ok when i first saw it but not GREAT.  However as i have seen it severall times since then it has become pretty good.  All sounds , visual effects and music are great as expected but that alone isnÂ´t enough is it ? ? ? ?Liam Neeson plays his part very well indeed as does Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker and the Pod race is the highlight of the movie in my opinion. Natalie Portman is great as Queen Amidala cos she has the charm that is needed. Pernila August, Ian McDirmaid also have good roles and come out well in this movie.The most sad thing about this move is the arrival of JAR JAR BINKS who tends to get on my nerves from time to time, altough he was a bit better the second time i saw this movie. The problem is that he propably plays the biggest role in this movie.  Ewan McGregor gets very little to do as Obi Wan but that will change when The Attack Of The Clones will come out.
MY RATING - Not great but ok and well worth seeing6 1/2 OUT of 10",7,0,1,2 October 2001
