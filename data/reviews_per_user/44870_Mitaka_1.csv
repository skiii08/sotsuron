The Blair Witch Project," In a word, WOW!
","Well, I finally got to see this film today. And to all of you who say the movie has been over-hyped, I say bunk! I've seen maybe two commercials since it came out, and one showing of the Sci-Fi Channel's 'mock'-umentary on the legend of the Blair witch. And even with the expectations I had of this movie, which were pretty high, I thought this was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I won't say that it utterly terrified me, but it was eerie in the extreme. Especially after *not going to spoil it totally* disappears. I recommend this to anyone who can go in and watch this movie not for what it is (a low-budget movie with a great concept and execution), but for what it's supposed to be (a chilling account of three students' run in with the unknown).It may not be real, but it's alot scarier if you treat it as though it is.Enjoy!",Null,1,2,18 August 1999
