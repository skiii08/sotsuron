Come and See," Saving a Thin Red Line
","Oh, this is just one of those boring social-realistic russian movies. That was what I thought before I saw this movie. But I had to reconcider radically afterwards. Forget The Thin Red Line, forget Saving Private Ryan, forget Platoon. Do you want to see a realistic and bizarre war-epic this is the one. Many weird moments but it all symbolize life or death, and the documentaric style often leaves you stunned and suprised. Oh, and if it was possible: Would you go back in time and kill Hitler?",8,2,4,17 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Yoda
","George Lucas is very fond of effects and it shows. And when the first two hours has very little action, but just a lovestory with bad dialogue, you start thinking, what am I doing here.Then there is a war, and the series is back to it's former greatness. Lightsaber-fights not with one, nor two, but every jedi in the universe. Even Yoda lights his saber, and gives us the absolute highlight of the movie.In episode I Jar-Jar broke up great actionsequences with stupid gags. This time around C3PO and R2D2 has teamed up again and interrupts some of the greatest Star Wars action ever. Uneccesary again, but more bearable.The actors of the Star Wars movies have always had to work with bad dialogue. The actors in episodes IV to VI managed it better than the performers in these newest films with only Ewan McGregor as the exception.Without the ending the film would get a rating of 2 from me. With the ending it manages to reach the area between 3 and 4. Not really bad, not great, not even mediocre. As pure entertainment: it works.",4,0,0,16 May 2002
Dark City," Eerie
","Dark, eerie science-fiction twist on the story of a man, John Murdoch,  who wakes up with insomnia, accused of committing murder. He knows within his heart that he didn't do it and seek the reason  why he is accused and reveals a fantastic story about aliens who can alter the environment with their mind. At first sight this was a fascinating and different movie from the director who gave us 'The Crow'. The dark 'Blade Runner'-setting underline Murdoch's chaos and give us a special 'The Wrong Man'-feeling. A mixture of The Wrong Man and Blade Runner sounds like its to good to be true, and it is. The 90s have given the special effects department more work than earlier and the last half of the this movie just becomes a effects-show. The mindgames are long gone. Now it's back to kill creatures for the visual enjoyment of it. It could have been so much better.",4,3,6,16 December 1999
La Grande Illusion," Poetic but boring
","French officers is prisoners of war in Germany during WWI. They never give up escaping, and gets transferred all the time. French poetic realism they called it. 60 years later we can also call it slow-paced and even boring. Well this movie ain't all that bad. And the last half hour is memorable. But the start introduces a lot of people that just disappears, and some of them are actually more interesting than those we follow lateron.",6,8,24,10 May 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," The Last Masterpiece.
","Stanley Kubrick was and is a master of filmmaking, so how could he fail with Eyes Wide Shut? The movie isn't boring, it isn't bad just totally uninteresting. The conflict isn't really a conflict, and there is to many scenes in the movie (usually with nudity) that could easily been left out.How can I judge Kubrick's filmmaking. The creator of 2001, Barry Lyndon, Full Metal Jacket, The Shining, Lolita, Spartacus, The Killing, Paths of Glory, Dr. Stangelove and A Clockwork Orange. I find all these movies great, but 'Eyes' is missing something, maybe he have repeated some scenes once to many and thereby lost  any sign of naturallity from the actors. Nicole Kidman is great the first hour thou, with her laughter-kick as an all-time high.P.S. I recogniced Sydney Pollack's eyes under the mask.",6,0,0,28 September 1999
A Hard Day's Night," 35 years ago...
","Has it really been that long, well, I wasn't even born then but everybody know about the masshysteria created by these guys.  The movie: It hasn't dated at all, the musical numbers could still be musicvideo in 1999 and still be state of the art. Without the CGI thou. But the Beatles was always inventive in their videos. Strawberry Fields Forever anyone?The music: I really have to hate the Beatles, to hate this movie, I don't so I had a jolly good time. But...It's the script, or the improvised dialogue that really makes this movie great. John, Paul, George and Ringo give us on-liners without becoming comedians, they're just as funny as any ordinary men would be. You should really see this one, good music, it's funny and inventive, what more can you expect?",9,1,1,12 December 1999
X2: X-Men United," The search ends here
","I must admit when I heard Bryan Singer was going to the direct the first X-men I just asked why? ...why? He had made great movies until that point and now he should sell his soul to a franchise?The first X-men was disappointing in general but had some treats for the comic-buff.This time around, the search is over, this is by far the best comic adaption ever made. It follows the pace of the comic, the frequent appearances of different characters of the comic and the whole setting is just the kind of roller coaster the old comic used to be.The casting (maybe except Scott Summers) is great, especially Xavier and Magneto. And some of the kids also looks promising.Some of the minor Characters like Beast (Dr. Hank McCoy), Colossus and Kitty Pryde I really wanted see more of. Every mutant character in this movie do have a possibility of doing an own franchise, maybe with a crossover with their fellow Marvel superheros Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, The Hulk and Dare-Devil to name a few.The Marvel Universe (great movie title) contains countless possibilities, we all expect that if Bryan Singer stays on board on this franchise this series will evolve (pun intended) to maybe the greatest comic-to-film-series ever. The third film will prove me right or wrong.",9,0,0,30 April 2003
