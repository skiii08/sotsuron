Hereditary," Watch it! Its genius!
",This is great! Anyone who says otherwise is just an idiot who thinks their opinion is worth more than it is. If you want to see an action packed movie go see a marvel movie. This is a HORROR movie. It dosent have to be fast paced. It's drawn out to build suspense while slowly informing you about what's going on. It's exactly what you should expect. It made me sweat in terror. Theres a lot of people talking crap about it and I'd be willing to put a paycheck on it that they're the type of people who rate final destination as a genuine horror movie.,9,3,7,11 September 2018
