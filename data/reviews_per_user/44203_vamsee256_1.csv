Iron Man 3," The only thing good about IM3 are the action sequences. Full stop.
","I had such high hopes when going for this movie, that perhaps I raised the bar too high for IM3. If I hadn't watched IM1, IM2 and Avengers, I probably wouldn't have been this disappointed. Here are some plot holes I would've liked to see corrected.1. Why you don't go threatening dangerous criminals by giving them your home address if you cannot protect itThe movie starts well until IM's house gets smashed to pieces with a few helicopter missiles. Now don't start questioning how or why IM, with his plethora of automated iron suits and sophisticated security systems couldn't save his house, not to mention he was expecting it. Also, later on in the movie we see him call his other suits using the same suit he is wearing during his escape. Now as a logical thinker, I really shouldn't ask why he didn't protect his house with these suits in the first place. Oh also he relies on just the one suit which was powering down during his escape. Now why didn't he call the others to save him once he escaped?2. Don't be frightened by a powerful villain because, maybe, he is just a comedian The initial part of the movie shows the Mandarin as a ruthless and extremely powerful criminal of Asian origin (talk about stereotypes) and the build up is quite impressive. However little do we know that the real villain is using him as a puppet (and with a much less catchy nickname). I would've loved to see Mandarin as the real villain.3. If at all you buy an iron suit, just make sure it comes with a warranty, coz, you know, it might break easilyWatching the movie, I was wondering if this is the same iron suit that could withstand Thor's hammer (without crumbling to pieces) or could hold against the aliens' technology. OK, maybe IM, in his 52nd iteration somehow made the suit brittle. A flimsy/easily breakable iron suit just doesn't gel with the image I have of IM.4. All's well if it ends wellNot really. The only memorable scenes in the movie are the action scenes (if you can somehow overlook the weak iron suits in these scenes). However RDJ's performance is outstanding. He lived up to his quirks, if I may say so.",5,4,8,29 April 2013
