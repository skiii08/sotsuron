Hereditary," Plan on not sleeping after watching this.
","This is the scariest movie I have seen in years. The only reason I didn't give it more stars is the ending was kind of crappy. It reminded me a lot of The Shining in terms of the descent into madness combined with supernatural occurences. A grief-stricken family tries to hold it together as the mother becomes more and more unglued - or is she? Is her hysteria justified? Does Grandma want to save her grandson from beyond the grave or does she want more? What is a husband to do while his wife loses her grip on reality? Or should he be forewarned and heed her advice? This could have a been a classic if not for the dissatisying ending. Very scary, I will be sleeping with the lights on tonight.",8,1,2,14 September 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Unforgettable.
","I knew this would be good, I did not know it would be a movie I would never forget. I don't know if Freddie was indeed the kind and gentle soul he was portray as in this film, I only know he was a musical legend. He is portrayed as too complex a person to even describe in this review. The scene where he is standing drenched in the rain and realizes he must cut loose the toxic people in his life is one of the most intense I have ever seen. He 'evolves' in this film, always knowing he was talented, but not always knowing he had so much more to offer as the person he was and the kindness he exuded. We are taken in moments to him tenderly caring for his many cats to giving performances to rock you out of your seat. We are taken to his journey to the hospital where he is recognized by a fan who sings a few notes as he begins to walk out the door. He stops, pauses, and sings back. We must remember this was a time when this horrible disease was kept utterly clandestine, so this small action was enough. We are taken on his journey with Mary, the Love of his Life. He is shy, wild, lost, kind, conflicted, lonely - but always fearless. Always loved.",10,1,1,29 April 2019
We're the Millers," What a funny, sweet movie - a must see!
","I can't believe how good this was - I was not expecting it to be so funny. It was kind of a hybrid between Half-baked and Little Miss Sunshine, but not exactly - shared some of the same comedic elements. Entire cast was stellar and by the end of the movie you truly grow attached to them. I would like to see a sequel because I enjoyed these characters so much. There was never a dull moment in it, either - pace keeps flowing with one table-turning event after another. Starts off as a 'fake' family, as the movie describes, but not only do we grow to care about the characters - they grow to care about each other. It's not sappy at all, though - it's very funny and a feel-good movie.",7,0,1,29 May 2016
The Witch," A cerebral horror film - takes you to another time....
","I wasn't sure what to expect from such polarized reviews. However, I enjoyed this movie. You will need to watch it in closed caption unless you have the ears of a bat or are used to pilgrim-speak. You instantly feel for this family as they are thrust out of their community and thrown into isolation (echoes of The Village). They pray thanks for their meager scraps of bread at dinner and do the best they can while slowly descending into madness (echoes of The Shining). Could be witchcraft, could be the poison corn, could be cabin fever - you will need to watch it to find out. As the story builds, the family begins to fall apart and turn on one another, as they think the eldest daughter to be a witch. However, we learn it is not all in their minds, as Caleb has an 'encounter' with a beautiful witch that the daughter is unaware even exists. This eventually leads to the boys dementia and demise as the evil destroys him from the inside out (echoes of The Exorcist).The family descends further into madness. Not only are they struggling in the wilderness, they now no longer can trust one another. The scene where Thomasine's own mother spits hateful accusations at her is heartbreaking.For those of you complaining about all of the religious talk - DUH - they were Puritans! This was a great movie, but left me feeling uneasy afterward, and quite somber. But if you are a horror movie aficionado, you should see this.",6,15,30,20 May 2016
