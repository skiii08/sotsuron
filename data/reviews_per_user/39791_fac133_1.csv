Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Totally Funny!!!!!
",This movie definitely deserves a 10. Borat is a total genius!! He definite deserved the award for best comedy this year...bummer there no Oscar nominee for best comedy....oh well...All other people who voted a 1 star those are the same people that Borat interacted in the Midwest..and probably the same people that voted for Bush....just plain ignorant and no sense of humor....its like saying Mel Brooks hates Jews and Chris Rock hates black people... ITS A MOVIE...ITS A COMEDY....GET A LIFE!Borat for President!!!!.....well maybe President of Kazakhstan....,10,2,12,16 March 2007
