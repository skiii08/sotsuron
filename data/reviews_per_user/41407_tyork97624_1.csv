The Sound of Music," When nuns raise their voices in song, look out!
","We know the story. We love the songs. They did a great job bringing it to the screen.  Laughter, tears..This film has it all. Eleanor Parker could have given tips to Cruella de Ville.  But this movie ain't no dog.  And that fabulous wedding dress!  Go, Julie, Go!!!",Null,0,5,19 July 2001
