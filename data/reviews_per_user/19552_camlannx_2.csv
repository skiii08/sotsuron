Alien 3," A mediocre TV episode
","What would happen if the Alien series had been turned into a TV series? Lots of episodes just like this one.  Alien3 breaks no new ground, introduces no new characters, and rehashes rather blandly the plots that preceded it.  Predictable, dreary, dismal.If this is the only Alien movie you've seen and you didn't like it, take heart.  Aliens is one of the finest sci fi or war movies ever made, and Alien did for horror what Star Trek did for sci fi.My advice would be to skip this one unless you, like I, just can't resist finding out what happened in the chapter you were told to avoid all along.  Charles Dance (the Doctor) is the only bright spot.  A 3 on a scale of 10.",3,497,542,14 December 1999
Aliens," Top of the line in two categories
","Aliens succeeds at everything it attempts.  It is one of the best science fiction and horror flicks but also one of the best war movies ever made. The characters are interesting and realistic.  You care about them (therefore avoid the third chapter).  The plot is exciting and suspenseful. The special effects are not only top notch but groundbreaking in style.If at all possible, see the long version and hope that it gets re-released in theaters so you can experience it in all its glory.  Bring someone you won't mind holding on to. A 10.",10,1,2,14 December 1999
