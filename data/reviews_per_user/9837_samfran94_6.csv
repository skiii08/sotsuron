Iron Man 3," Exciting, tense, funny - an all round hit! Marvel gets it right again!
","After the incredible success of the Avengers it's fair to say a stand alone Marvel superhero movie had a lot to live up to. With new director Shane Black at the helm who knew what to expect from Iron Man 3 but in my opinion it was a blinding success!By far the best of the three movies, Iron Man 3 is heart-racing, mouth- gaping, visually stunning and surprisingly hilarious! Shane Black has done a brilliant job, and I liked the way he focused the story more on Tony Stark than Iron Man. We see Tony as an individual.He is struggling with the fallout of the Avengers' battle in New York, his relationship with Pepper has become extremely strained, he distances himself from Rhodey (a brilliantly cast Don Cheadle) as well as fighting his own personal battles as Tony admits in the opening monologue 'we create our own demons'Not giving Tony anytime to think is the villainous Mandarin (played by Ben Kingsley, or so it would seem) who arrives on the scene to 'teach America a lesson' through violent terrorist attacks. Also causing Tony problems is the shady scientist Aldrich Killian (portrayed excellently by the wonderful character actor Guy Pearce) who apparently has a hidden agenda against Tony, from the 'history' the two have. The film is exciting from start to finish as the audience watched Tony trying to cope with these powerful new threats, his own problems, and the anxiety that arises from putting on the Iron Man suit, all building to an awesome climax upon which rests the safety of the world. No pressure then.Full of outstanding effects, most notably the astonishing siege on Stark's mansion, and a brilliant script filled with zippy one liners, most seen between Stark and Harley a small boy he befriends. These scenes show Downey Jr's unbelievable charisma and abilities as a comic actor. Also hilarious and deservedly given more screen time is Stark's driver and best friend Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau). The relationship between Tony and Pepper is also captured well by Black , this movie feels much more emotional and human than the first two, an all round great achievement, with new additions to the cast Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall all proving themselves excellent choices.Now Marvel has gotten us all excited again, we anticipate and speculate what surprises will be in store for us with the release of Thor 2 due later this year, and a teasing post-credit scene that leaves us drooling over the prospect of Avengers 2 but I guess we'll have to wait a little longer for that one.",10,10,23,26 April 2013
Life of Pi," Brilliant as a Bengal Tiger! . . . just lacked the bite.
","For me 'Life of Pi' was all about anticipation. I had read Yann Martel's novel and loved it! I had listened to all the critical acclaim, watched all the awards shows and today I sat down for the first time and was ready to see for myself just how amazing the movie was.Visually, the movie is absolutely stunning. Ang Lee and his effects team can't be praised enough for the incredible work they have done on this movie. There are some truly unbelievable sequences my favourites being the scenes with the flying fish, the meerkats, and the whale. The fact that they were able to create a CGI tiger that is so realistic, beautiful and terrifying is enough on its own to hand that Best Director Oscar to Ang Lee. He shows how he had the ability to handle the project. He brings a seemingly impossible concept to the big screen, and emphasises that he is definitely one of the leaders and innovators in his field.Although the overall experience of the film is awe-inspiring, I'm not sure why but something didn't quite 'pop' for me. I'm a huge fan of the story, and I don't think Lee's interpretation even strayed very far from Martel's text, but the movie didn't fully have that 'knockout punch' effect on me. The story is fantastic, Martel clearly possesses an incredible imagination, and Lee a highly commendable talent for transferring the premise to cinema. The movie follows Pi as he retells his astounding story of survival on a lifeboat with a tiger, a zebra, a hyena and an orangutan. He loses everything and the movie is a wonderful tale of friendship, faith and the will to live. Also handled well is the story's ambiguous ending but I won't spoil that here for you.The movie is also well-cast with newcomer Suraj Sharma not being intimidated by the sheer weight of his role, and showing that although relatively inexperienced, he is capable of carrying a blockbuster epic all on his own shoulders. Rafe Spall also does well as the writer recording Pi's tale.'Life of Pi' is not a bad, or even an average movie by any stretch of the imagination. I would recommend it to anyone, but for some reason the movie just didn't click for me. Perhaps all the anticipation surrounding it had built up my expectations a little too high, or maybe it was because I didn't view the film in the cinema and thus missed out on the proper experience but for me the movie just lacked that key ingredient.Nevertheless, it is an exceptional cinematic feat that is worth a watch purely for the effects, and I'm looking forward to what other projects Ang Lee has lined up for the future.",8,0,2,29 May 2013
Collateral," Tom Cruise with grey hair? - It works!
","Always been a fan of Michael Mann's movies (Heat, Ali etc) so thought 'Collateral' would be a good watch for me. I wasn't disappointed.I really enjoyed the movie it works as both an action movie, and a psychological thriller in my opinion with plenty of suspense, plot twists, high speed car chases and one awesome nightclub shootout.The film follows Max (Jamie Foxx) a humble cab driver as he makes his rounds in LA only to pick up the mysterious passenger Vincent (Tom Cruise). Eager to start his own business and in need of the cash Max reluctantly accepts Vincent's offer to drive him around town for the night so he can 'close a few deals'. But Max quickly learns that these 'deals' are not all they seem and neither is Vincent, and the film becomes a race against time as Max tries to correct his mistakes and save lives he has put in jeopardy including his own!Really good cast for this film, supporters including Jada Pinkett Smith, Peter Berg and Marc Ruffalo, playing a detective connecting the dots and realising there's something unusual about this case. Tom Cruise does well in a rare role as the villain, and has good on screen chemistry with Foxx which is vital considering most of the move revolves just around the two of them sitting in the cab.With some brilliant shots of downtown LA, high octane action sequences, tense encounters and a solid script; I would recommend 'Collateral' to anyone who likes movies that are unpredictable, exciting and keep you on the edge of your seat.Only downside in my opinion is that the dialogue can be a little shifty or mumbled making the movie a little hard to follow on occasions, but apart from that a really great watch!P.S. If you've seen the movie, can you believe they originally wanted Adam Sandler to play the role of Max? Me neither.",8,1,1,3 May 2013
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," You'll Go Ape! (Excuse the Un-Original Pun)
","I've seen the original Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston and although I enjoyed it I have to say I wasn't overwhelmed. The 4 sequels it produced also seemed to deteriorate as they went further along, and the Tim Burton's poorly received remake in 2001 left many viewers (including myself) skeptical as to what sort of impact this 'reboot' would deliver.An absolute knockout punch in my opinion that resurrects the franchise with a bang!This film has blockbuster written all over it and the effects are absolute brilliant. I'd like to go on record to say how much of a genius Andy Serkis is for his incredible motion capture performance as Caesar, the chimpanzee whose story the film revolves around. Having already used his ability to give us the on screen presences of Gollum and King Kong, Serkis absolutely nails this one, making us pity, love, admire, suspect and fear his character simply through body language.The film acts as a kind of prequel/kind of reboot that could easily set up a whole new franchise on its own. We watch young, ambitious scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) as he relentlessly tries to find a cure for Alzheimer's to save his father. But by 'playing God' and testing on chimps Will gets more than he bargains for when they display different side effects to humans. The first test subject Caesar seems to react positively becoming Will's companion and crowning achievement. But Caesar soon notices his inferiority to humans and as he continues to develop, Will realises he can no longer control him or his ideas.The movie has an excellent script with an abundance of trivial nods to the original franchise, as well as a promising cast including Franco, Freida Pinto, John Lithgow and Tom Felton who breaks away from his 'Potter' typecasting quite well.With stunning shots of San Francisco, and some captivating action sequence including the heart-stopping finale which takes place on Golden Gate Bridge, this film will excite and amaze both old fans and those new to the series. For someone who is not usually a sci-fi fan my attention was kept throughout the entire film, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone, especially to those unimpressed by the original series and Burton's remake because this was an all-round hit!Now all that remains is to anticipate the sequel 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' which arrives in May 2014, but one thing's for sure as long as Serkis is back wearing that motion capture suit we're in for a real treat.",10,3,5,16 May 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Academy will be 'crying Wolf'!
","If I could sum up 'The Wolf of Wall Street' I would say it's a film that you definitely wouldn't want to watch with your parents. Why you may ask? I'll tell you, Scorsese and DiCaprio's fifth outing together is an unparallelled roller-coaster ride of twists and turns, highs and lows fuelled by drugs, alcohol, gambling, hedonism and million dollar business deals. To cut a long story short it might it's incredible! ... but might be a little awkward to watch with your folks around.Without sounding like I'm jumping on the bandwagon I honestly feel this could be the year that Leonardo DiCaprio breaks his infamous 'Oscar curse'. He is in sensational form as Jordan Belfort, the eponymous 'Wolf'. We first meet Jordan as an innocent 22 year old, a fish out of water in the overwhelming world of the New York stock market, trying to make a name for himself. Over the course of the early 1990s we retrace the Wolf's steps as he transforms from a humble family man to a ruthless, domineering drug addict raking in $49m a year and gallivanting with legions of gorgeous women. However, the fabric of Belfort's success soon begins to unravel as he is pursued by the authorities, becomes consumed by addiction and greed, and is alienated by those closest to him. The way the character self-destructs is captured brilliantly by DiCaprio, he appeals to our empathetic side playing a broken man who couldn't quit while he was ahead. DiCaprio brings raw energy to a role that demands it. He exudes charisma and seamlessly slips into Belfort's 'Wolf' persona conveying his dizzying highs and tormenting lows through his god-given acting talent. If he is overlooked by the Academy this year, cries of 'fix' and 'conspiracy' could very well ring throughout the auditorium.DiCaprio's job is certainly made a hell of lot easier by the truly delicious cast Scorsese has assembled around him. Also tipped for Oscar success (Best Supporting Actor) is Jonah Hill, playing Belfort's neurotic business partner Donnie Azoff. It was recently revealed that Hill took the SAG's minimum pay of $60,000 for this role, simply because he was desperate to work with Scorsese, one of his heroes. This enthusiasm is immediately apparent as he takes to the role like a duck to water. Hill is now quickly establishing himself as hot property on the Hollywood scene, and distancing himself from his 'gross-out' comedy roots. His chemistry with DiCaprio is effortless and unforced, creating a warm, humorous and believable relationship upon which the movie fundamentally survives. Also doing well, although a little underused I felt, is the silver screen's 'Renaissance Man' Matthew McConaughey as broker Mark Hanna who first shows Jordan the ropes. The 'chest-beating' scene is definitely one for the ages! Similarly impressive are Rob Reiner as Jordan's hot- tempered father, Joanna Lumley as Emma his demure and seductive aunt, and P.J. Byrne as 'Rugrat' one of his 'merry men' in the office ensuring the money, among incalculable line of cocaine, keeps piling up.The performance I really enjoyed however was Margot Robbie as Naomi, Belfort's second wife. Robbie's contribution to the movie is brilliant, and that's not just me speaking as a warm-blooded male. The young Australian beauty conveys incredible emotion and vulnerability as she is tossed back and forth between both ends of Belfort's precarious spectrum. The sheer euphoria of their wedding in the Caribbean and the million dollar yachts, and the plight and terror of being dominated by an increasingly overbearing, drug-dependent, almost bipolar husband. At the tender age of 23 the future certainly looks bright for Robbie. She is already being touted to star as Jane in David Yates' upcoming 'Tarzan', and with performances like this no one will dare question any such casting decisions.The editing and cinematography, although unorthodox, are also fantastic juxtaposing a sober and intoxicated Belfort beautifully. Scorsese essentially knocks another one out of the ball park, which is no less than anyone expected, and if he can continue to churn out movies of such high calibre in the future he will only further cement his position as one of cinema's greatest ever directors.The only criticism I would perhaps make, and I really am being picky here, is the running time. At 3 hours Scorsese's movie incurs, a probably unavoidable mid-movie slump. We see 'The Wolf' make his rise but before the fall begins, I'll admit there was a slight lapse in my concentration. The movie seemed to drop off a little bit before it picked up its exhilarating, high octane drama again. But I'll admit I am just looking for a needle in a hay stack here, a small blip on an otherwise fabulous movie, that MUST bring home some gold at this year's Oscars!",8,0,2,25 January 2014
Semi-Pro," A Slam Dunk! (For Ferrell Fans)
","If anyone like me is a huge of Will Ferrell and his style of comedy, then there's no doubt that this is an excellent film choice for you, I loved it!Another sports comedy for Ferrell this time, after Talladega Nights (2005) and Blades of Glory (2007), once again proving itself winning formula with hilarious results.The film sees outspoken basketball franchise owner Jackie Moon who desperately tries to coach, play for and motivate his team when they hear the news that they will be dropped from the league.Will Ferrell is obviously brilliant playing the eccentric and overwhelming Jackie Moon, but is also supported by a great cast including Woody Harrelson, who takes well to his comedic role, Andre Benjamin (previously of Outkast fame) who looks a promising newcomer as a comedy actor and old favourites of Ferrell's movies including Andy Richter, Will Arnett and David Koechner.Full of snappy one liners that you'll be quoting for hours afterwards, and some truly outrageous scenes including Jackie wrestling a bear, and an on-court altercation with a priest! The highlight of this movie in my opinion is the poker game, I won't spoil it for you, but it's definitely not one to be missed it's side splittingly funny.Obviously, this movie is by no means perfect and the reason I've given it such a high rating is because I love these types of comedy and find Ferrell one of, if not the best in his field. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea but if you're looking for a good laugh with your friends and something not at all serious for your movie night then give 'Semi Pro' a chance it won't let you down!",9,1,1,7 May 2013
