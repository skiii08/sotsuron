Black Swan," ...not so much!
","Just so you know... I hated Avatar too... Watched this wanting to like it. Although I'm not a huge fan of Aronofsky's, I like the ballet and all the actors so I thought...'how bad can it be?' Well, it turns out... pretty bad. Natalie Portman obviously worked very hard and deserves a lot credit for her physical commitment to the role, but begins this movie at a 9.6 on the crazy scale and stretches all the way to 9.9 when she's done. Gee, THAT was exciting to watch. Then, factor in all the weird fantasy moments... in other words, everything that's interesting in the movie isn't real. And special mention must go out to the ludicrously scripted and overacted role of Thomas Leroy. And finally, Aronofsky's calling card of 'now I've got to make the audience squirm' moments. (a la Requiem for a Dream...) Toenail rubbing off, Picking bloody cuticles, Picking skin, Bloody accident wounds and my favorite... Winona Ryder suddenly stabbing herself in the face. I was just shaking my head for the last 45 minutes.",2,29,55,18 January 2011
