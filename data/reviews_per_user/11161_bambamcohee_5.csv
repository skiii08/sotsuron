The New World," Beautiful but boring at parts
","For an assignment is a history through film class. So we can be introduced to Terrence Malick. Malick is telling a story about Jamestown and its settlers. Specifically the natives, Pocahontas, John Smith and John Rolfe. He tried to capture what life was like with the natives and settlers. He also showed the difficulties Pocahontas had with loving Smith and trying to balance him and her people. 
Something that gave away the time period was definitely the way of life. It was very primitive and uncivilized. Very dirty and lack of technology. The clothing was another thing because like no body where's dresses that stop you from breathing properly. 
I don't really know anything about the history of Jamestown so there wasn't anything i caught until i was told. Things like Pocahontas meeting Smith back in England Also the exaggeration of her saving Smith's life.
I haven't seen any movies based in this period of time. Therefore I can't make any connections.
How it showed the natives as friendly and playful until provoked. The expressions of the actors. It wasn't all serious, there was light heartedness.
They didnt show what happened to the settlers, yeah we know they got sick and starved but what was it like?
It was a good movie overall. It was the closest ive seen to it being the real story even with the added junk. I do want to see more movies by Malick and movies with the same actors.",8,0,0,30 August 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Great western movie to some historical accuracy
",I watched this movie for my history through film class. It was the next one for the semester. The filmmaker is telling the tale of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The filmmaker is putting their own take on the story. It isn't 100% to the real thing but is close. I recognized one of the actors from a current movie. This could be used to help determine how old the movie is based off of his age. The special effects could also give it away as they weren't the best. The biggest thing i liked about the movie was that it was a very well done western movie. They stayed true to the time period and didn't stray at all. Clothing and props were as close at they could be to the real things. I didn't like the scream the entire Mexican gang did. I would like to see more movies by these actors. Preferably in the old west time period again. I'd also like to see more movies by the same director.,10,2,3,23 October 2018
The Alamo," Great Historical Film
",I watched this movie to gain a better understanding of the Alamo. This was one of the best films to ever capture what it was like even with the limitations of the budget. The filmmaker is telling the story of the Alamo. What it was like to be at siege inside the fort. What it was like to endure constant attacks from the French and Mexican armies. Then to show that the war wasn't lost when the Alamo was. Pretty much everything gave it away that the movie was recently produced. It wasn't grainy at all and had great sound. The acting was really well done; just as the special effects were. Of course there's really know what to know exactly what happen because the winners always write history. However there's small things that may not seem to real. For example how Crockett stopped the Alamo from being fired upon one night because he played his violin in harmony with the French. This movie's time period is pretty far from the historical films I've watched so I can't make any connections. I enjoyed how accurate this was to the actual battle. I loved how it showed and explained that Huston took out Anna's army in 18 min. There wasn't anything i didn't like; you can't dislike something for being accurate. Overall this was an amazing movie with great actors and an awesome director. I found it interesting how they managed to capture it and have it be a good representation of the battle. I would like to see more movies with the same actors and director.,10,0,2,9 October 2018
Wonder Woman," Amazonian Fighter Lady Movie
","I watched this movie for my history through film class. I was the next one on the list. The filmmaker is telling the story of Wonder Woman and when she was introduced. This is done through WW1 even though she was made in WW2. The filmmaker took their own spin on the character but didn't do it right at all. The special effects are so well done that this movie couldn't have been made pre 2010. The actors are also like alive and have only aged a year so that helps too. Yes, the only accurate thing in the movie is the German general's name. Nothing else was accurate. I've see Wonder Woman in another movie. I liked the pretty much everything in the movie. The one thing i didn't like was how Ares was portrayed. Oh and he said he wanted to show the other gods how Man are naturally evil.",8,5,7,15 November 2018
Cinderella Man," bop bop bang
",I watched this movie because it was next on the list. The filmmaker is telling the story of James Braddock's come back. He got old and many thought he'd stop fighting. James came was the underdog in many fights but manage to surprise everyone. The special effects and make up are very well done. They aren't excessive at all. This can be used to determine it was a pretty recent movie. I don't know anything about boxing legends so i can't say anything there. As for the great depression portion of the movie; there's nothing that makes me question the accuracy. I haven't seen any other boxing movies and i don't remember any movies that showed how bad the depression was. The lady literally stole a steak from a fancy place because they couldn't afford any food. I liked the comeback story. How even with a broken hand he kept working and fighting. I also like how a steak was stolen. I didn't like how the earlier scenes seemed to cut to different things instead of flowing. All in all it was a great movie. I don't care about seeing more movies with the actors but i would like to see more from the director.,10,1,1,4 December 2018
