Mission: Impossible III," it could even be better than the first
","mission impossible is back with a bang, we all know how disappointing the second one was but the third one lights up the series and it could even be better than the first, even if u don't like tom cruise hes still a great actor no matter what weird things he gets up to outside of acting.there is so many twists in this film too that ur just guessing right until the end, the scene on the bridge is amazing, it gets u involved with missiles been fired everywhere. phillip seymour Hoffman is brilliant but the one thing that baffled me was the mission in rome, they said there was loads of security cameras but they only took out one, that was the only bad thing about the movie, i wud recommend this to anyone who loves action movies",8,0,3,21 May 2006
The Da Vinci Code," the book is better
","yes we all know the controversy about this movie being made but the book was a best selling novel, it had to be made into a movie. the book is better but I'm not taking anything away from the film because the film is good but i preferred the book and the film was too long too. i went to see it with someone who had never read the book and he loved it and it convinced him that maybe there is a conspiracy going on, for me I'm in between did Jesus have an affair with a prostitute, possibly!go and see it no matter what your religious beliefs are, the facts are there leonardo da vinci has the facts in pictures,the acting is brilliant especially tom hanks, ian mckellen is brilliant as usual and jean reno who i respect a lot had a good performance",7,0,2,21 May 2006
