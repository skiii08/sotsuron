Marie Antoinette," She married at 15, became queen at 19 and it took her 7 and a half years to consummate her marriage.
","Anyone who has ever heard the name Marie-Antoinette is bound to know two definitive things: First, her infamous and false 'Let them eat cake.' line and second for her untimely demise. Of course the film does not touch the subject of her death (which seems to make a lot of people hate the film and regard it as historically inaccurate) the whole point of the movie was to show a different side of Marie-Antoinette, which has rarely been seen before. Not to portray her court proceedings (which in themselves are quite interesting) or her beheading. Sofia Coppola's goal was to show an unseen side to a famous monarch so mistreated in her time and throughout history. One must remember that this young queen was indeed YOUNG when she married and took over as the Queen of France. Many responsibilities, including producing an heir with what seemed an uninterested husband, lay on her shoulders. I find that most complaints about the movie revolve around the many parties, shopping, and overall 'teen' perspective if you will. Of course Marie was also known for being the Jennifer Lopez of our generation. She broke style boundaries for her time and was after all a teenage girl. Another touchy subject would be the musical score found throughout the film, which is relatively 80's rock music. Personally I loved the movie. The perspective was fresh and original, the costumes delightful, the cinematography beautiful and as for the music? I liked it. I find it added something new to a film that tried to tell a young woman's story with a new perspective and bring it to a more relating base with today's generation, whether young or old. When watching the film, you feel as if you can connect more with the character than you would otherwise with historical films. Don't get me wrong, I'm very stringent when it comes to historical accuracy, but for this movie, I felt as if I could let it go. I didn't care if they didn't have accents (a big for me), or if the musical score wasn't in keeping with traditional; I felt as if I could let that all out the door and watch Marie's story through her perspective as a young struggling woman. The whole seemed to make her more natural, more human than historical films tend to otherwise glorify and put their characters on immortal pedestals. The music and the partying (which she was famous for) just seemed to make her more like a teenage girl from today's generation which also really helped relate to her struggles. Others might argue that this was only a marketing ploy (the music, that is) to lure teens into seeing a historical film that contains many historical inaccuracies. If you want a film with historical inaccuracies why not watch King Arthur. Frankly, whether you liked it or not, is not the point, and you shouldn't let others influence your opinion. Rent it, hate it, love it, doesn't matter, it's what you take away from the story that counts. Mistreated, misjudged, hated?Â…you have no idea.",8,1,2,18 February 2007
