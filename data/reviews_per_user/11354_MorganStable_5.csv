50 First Dates," Did I laugh at this? I don't remember.....
","A comedy in which I laughed out loud app four times.  Once I chuckled.  A small guffaw or two.  That was it.  For 90 minutes.Remember when Groundhog Day took the same concept and found every imagineable laugh possible.  What does 50 First Dates do... use lines like 'Very funny' as a retort.  Adam trying new ways to impress Drew for the first time, again and again. 'You're the state moron of Hawaii.'  Sean Astin with a lisp.  AND WAY TOO MUCH DRAMA ABOUT DREW'S CONDITION.
I don't ask much of Adam Sandler comedies.  And this one couldn't even reach the bare minimum.  Hell, even Little Nicky was funnier.",3,2,6,22 February 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," All things considered - a real good time
","Face it:  T2 is as good as moviemaking gets.  There's no way to beat it, or even to equal it.  Take that attitude, and this movie becomes infinitely better.First:  Arnold.  This role is why he is on Earth.  Still fits him like a glove.These action sequences are not bombastic over computerized seizures like Matrix Reloadofcrapped.   They're based on a semblance of a real world. I personally believed they destroyed all of LA in one car chase.  Truly the action highlight of the summer.Complaints will be heard all across the land.  But T3 moves, has several good set pieces, a corker of an ending, strong performances, an engaging story, and one of our most beloved icons keeping the whole ship afloat. The whole lithe affair made me hate Matrix Reloaded even more.",8,0,0,3 July 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Dumb Arses
","I can't believe you people were suckered in by this pretentious drek. 
Here's my biggest beef - if you can tell something's a computer effect, then it hasn't done it's job.  For instance, the car chase.  First few minutes- great.  Exciting.  Then something happens - the computer takes over (not unlike the plot of the movie)  Green screen.  Computerized actors. Computerized cars.  Sucky stuff, people. The last fifteen minutes are just atrocious.  The Architect?  Puh-leaze. 
Shame on anyone who thinks this is smart entertainment.  It's high priced shlock.Go rent Santo and the Blue Demon vs. Wolfman and Dracula instead.<ul><li>Lizard Man</li></ul>",2,0,1,23 July 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," If you like this movie, you have my pity
","I'll give them credit - the Wachowskis love comic books and Japanimation. And they know how to blur the line between video game and movie with extreme craft.That being said, I just sat through a very long two-plus hours of alleged razzle dazzle that mostly just sat there like my Uncle Stanley. I know this is half a movie, but all the payoff in the world can not make up for the dead space, monotonous stunts, logic loopholes, wooden performances, subpar effects (yes, some of them just look chintzy), and schmorgasbord approach to plot and character that is the Matrix Reloaded.X-Men 2 had several action sequences that were exciting, character driven, and fresh.  In Matrix 2, the action is so over the top to remove any sense of danger, and thus little sense of excitement.  There is not one second in Matrix 2 that came close to the sheer thrill and ingenuity of Magento's escape from X-Men.And the muddled plot?  I'm sorry, but build up for the next sequel is NOT AN EXCUSE.   The Keymaster?  The Architect?  The GHOST NELSONS? The RIDICULOUS FRENCHMAN?   This could be a 100 hour miniseries, and it still wouldn't matter.  There's nothing interesting or intelligent about any of these new additions, many of which feel like they were straight out of the Mystery Men.On the positive - the car chase has a few remarkable minutes, as does the fight with the 100 Agent Smiths.  But in both cases, the sheer magnitude begins to wear the scenes down.And yet, critics are taking to this humdrum mess.  I don't get it.  You might have like it too.  Glad one of us felt like they got their eight bucks worth.",2,0,1,15 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," This movie whoops Matrix Reloaded, and you're an idjut if you disagree
","The Architect?  The French Dude?  The Buxom Woman who Wants to Mack with Keanu? The Keymaster?While Reloaded took a derivative premise and bloated it to incomprehensibility and tedium, X-Men 2 found its groove.  Even my non-comic reading fiancee LOVED this movie.Here's why you should go see this again and again.1. Action Scenes that are driven by drama instead of just effects - Nightcrawler's attack on the White House is a fantastic set piece... and that's the first minute.  Stryker's futile attempt at capturing the School is even better, with new Mutants popping up everywhere, anda furious Wolverine defending his turf.2.  The new characters are terrific.  Nightcrawler's nothing shy of perfect. PERFECT.  Pyro.  Ten seconds of Colossus.  Stryker.  Bryan Singer's real feat is juggling almost a dozen major roles with such panache.
3.  Halle Berry did not even attempt an accent this time.  IT's true. Funniest thing I've witnessed in any movie this year. Guess an Oscar makes acting easier.4.  Magento's escape - It's the single finest comic book-esque moment in any adaptation EVER.  Except for....5.  Nightcrawler's mid-air rescue of Rogue.6.  You buy what's happening.  If you think for a sec: 'that's a cool computer effect,' than it doesn't work (i.e. about 90 percent of the Matrix Reloaded).7.  A great twist at the end.X-Men 2 figured out the trick of making a comic book movie.  Treat the characters like real characters, and the action, the special effects, and the drama will follow.",9,0,0,20 May 2003
