The Rock," This movie is incredible!
","The Rock is a great film.  Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery and Ed Harris are all fantastic.  The film boasts some great action sequences.  It's very enjoyable and intense, I highly recommend it.* * * 1/2",10,2,4,5 September 1998
Armageddon," Armageddon: Some show, no go
","The second asteroid related movie of the summer is not all it's cracked up to be.  The film starts off with a brief, special effects laden meteor shower, which is entertaining, but then the film goes downhill.  Armageddon tries to mix many different genres into it, action, drama, romance, but doesn't succeed in any. In  fact the film is more enjoyable when it doesn't take itself seriously and decides to dish out some jokes, most of which come from Steve Buscemi.  It goes for about an hour or so of pointless training exercises getting ready to go into space, and it has no point to it.  The plot is also terrible.  If there is one reason to see this movie, it's the special effects, they are cool, but that's about it.  Oh, and if you do go, sit in the back, this movie is very, very loud.* *",Null,0,1,5 September 1998
Face_Off," Great performances, lame plot
","Face/Off is a so-so action movie, with some great talent. Both Nicolas Cage and John Travolta are very convincing as bad guy, good guy, then vice -versa. While the acting is good, the rest of the movie is nothing great, it offers some nice action, the jailbreak scene is good, but the plot is so silly and ridiculous that i didn't enjoy it all that much.* *",Null,0,1,6 September 1998
Con Air," Great Fun
","Con Air is a great action film, with lots of explosions and bad guys. Nicolas Cage is Cameron Poe, a man on parole, who is hitching a ride home on a plane, with some of the world's most dangerous criminals, and yes, they take over the plane! John Malkovich is terrific as Cyrus the Virus. John Cusack and Steve Buscemi co-star.* * *",7,1,2,6 September 1998
A Night at the Roxbury," Pathetic
","I am a big fan of the Roxbury guys on SNL, and after seeing the preview for a Night at the Roxbury, I was eager to see it. What a waste of money. Almost all of the funny moments were taken and put in the preview. There are few moments that are funny. The roxbury guys are funny in 7 minute increments on SNL, but for 80 minutes, they are obnoxious, stupid, and not very funny.",Null,0,2,27 December 1998
The Wedding Singer," A heart warming romantic comedy
","Formerly my impression of Adam Sandler was that he was a funny guy, and could only do stupid roles, such as Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, but i was proven wrong. With the Wedding Singer, Sandler is still funny as ever, but this time he is charming, sweet, and very nice. The chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Sandler is terrific.  Having the film take place in 1985 doesn't do much, but it's a nice little touch.* * * 1/2",Null,0,1,6 September 1998
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The best Indy.
","Harrison Ford returns as Indiana Jones! This time Sean Connery joins the mix , and adds some variety.  The Temple of Doom was quite disappointing and this Indy is much better, starting off with a great chase along a circus train with a younger Indiana Jones, and keeps on satisfying with a wild boat chase, and numerous other action scenes. I highly recommend this.* * * *",Null,2,3,5 September 1998
