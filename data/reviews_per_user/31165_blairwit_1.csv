The Blair Witch Project," I still can't sleep.
","A triumph of imagination over finance.  The Blair Witch Project is a horrifying exercise in the psychology of fear that, if there is any justice in the world, will be recognized fifty years from now as a classic film. It's not just a great HORROR movie, either; it's a great MOVIE period, the first truly imaginative and original one this Oscar year.  In a righteous world, a shoe-in Best Picture nominee; in any world, the most insanely daring and worthwhile piece of celluloid to come down the pike in a long time.  Oh, and if YOU can shake the last image, drop me a line and let me know how, because it's been seared on the inside of my eyelids every time I've closed them in the past week.",10,1,2,19 July 1999
