Sucker Punch," What happened to 2 hours of my life?
","First of all, to all you people who loved this movie, I respect your opinion. But seriously, I find it hard to find a single good thing about this movie. Being a fan of 300 and Watchmen I refused to believe the reviews. Reviews that burned down this movie. Surely a man who made such great movies cannot create such a monster of a flick? How wrong I was. I should have listened. They were right. I encourage everyone to think for themselves but in this case, believe what you read or hear about Sucker Punch. At least believe the bad reviews. Save your money for a good movie. Do not spend it on this. And why is it so bad? let me sum it up in 1 simple line. Before you can have a story within a story within a story, you should have a story to start with, just special effects does not make a story. Mister Snyder needed 'to go Deeper' with this story before he started shooting.",1,7,15,31 March 2011
