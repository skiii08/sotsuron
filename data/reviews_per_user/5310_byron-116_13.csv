Ford v Ferrari," Bale overacts.....
","Long film at 2 1/2 hours, but enjoyable for the most part. Damon is brilliant in the role but Bale overacts. Best to see the film in a theater with a larger than life screen.",7,0,3,29 December 2019
Captain Marvel," That's not Captain Marvel . . .
","Captain Marvel is one of the worst films I ever watched . . .Why oh why did they have to make this film and spoil the good memories of the real Captain Marvel, Billy Batson and Dr. Sivana,In revenge of watching this 2019 film, I dug up and watched The Adventures of Captain Marvel, the 1941 serial and thoroughly enjoyed all 12 chapters.",1,64,113,9 March 2019
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Goofy and silly, but....
","It's goofy, it's silly, it's dopey, it's wacky, but It's sweet enough to watch pleasantly.
Will Ferrel is too old for the character, and the film should have been shortened by 15-20 minutes. Despite the latter, the film is well worth a 6",6,1,3,2 July 2020
Knives Out," This is a good who-dunit
","Knives Out is a good 'who's the murderer' and it's not the butler type of movie....
Daniel Craig's gives a sterling performance, but I did not care for his accent...
First 30 minutes are a bit weary, but the rest of the film makes up for it
Knives Out is closely akin to Agatha Christie's stories",7,2,3,9 January 2020
The Irishman," Never a dull moment in all of the 3-1/2 hours.....
","This is Scorsese's finest film and ranks amongst best mob movies to date. Superb acting by DeNiro, Pacino and more particularly by Joe Pesci and Ray Romano too. Hope that despite his advanced age, Scorsese will continue to give us such great films.",9,5,11,27 November 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Was reluctant to watch it....
",Was reluctant to watch it because I didn't care too much about Spike Lee's previous works.... HOWEVER BlackkKlansman kept my undivided attention throughout.... A very enjoyable film,7,3,6,14 January 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," One of few GREAT 2018 films
",Rami Malex is outstanding as Freddy Mercury. He well deserved the Golden Globe and should/must be nominated for an Oscar. I preferred Boemian Rhapsody over A Star is Born....,9,5,7,14 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," When Hollywood was ......
",.....still the Hollywood that it was. Enjoyable to watch especially if you lived that era. Superb performance by Brad Pitt. Tarantino's best film to date.,7,0,0,5 July 2020
1917," A WAR MOVIE OR NOT A WAR MOVIE....
","Yes, it's a war movie... but not really. It's more about a corporal's determination to accomplish his given orders; and that he does through thick and thin !Excellent cinematography, superb directing, good acting, believable scenery, and so much more.It's a very good film worthy of the 10 Oscar nominations... I shall predict 1917 will win for Directing, and possibly some other categories too - but not for Best Picture!",8,1,2,17 January 2020
Parasite," A most enjoyable colorful comedy/thriller/crime/drama
","I liked Parasite very much and had predicted that it would win the Oscar for best foreign language film - as it rightfully did !However, I could never have imagined that Parasite would also win in the best picture category as well. Shouldn't the Academy's eligibility rules permit a film to enter in only ONE of these two categories ? ? ?",8,4,7,17 February 2020
Marriage Story," Sure Oscar contender
","Marriage story is a certain Oscar contender in several categories, including best film, actor, actress and particularly supporting actress Laura Dern. The film will remind you of Kramer vs Kramer....",7,0,4,8 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," This my 2nd review, with a change of mind.....
","I had previously reviewed Jojo Rabbit and rated it a '1' because of the disgusting neck-wringing bunny scene and I walked out.....I eventually decided to rewatch this movie today, which I did only from AFTER the nauseating scene..... And from that point on I thoroughly enjoyed the film.... it's funny, it's sad, it's emotional, it's thought-stirring, and sheer a joy to watch the marvelous performances of one and all.Jojo Rabbit is rightfully nominated for an Oscar Best Picture.... but it would have a better chance of winning without that nauseating bunny scene....",7,2,6,13 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," it's not 'Springtime for Hitler'....
","I started watching 'Jojo the Rabbit' and frowned as the first few minutes went by, but I kept on watching in hope for the better.... The last straw was when the Nazi broke the rabbit's neck .... what a gross scene ! The whole film is gross in its endeavor for comedy...Yes, 'Jojo the Rabbit' is a Nazi satire but it certainly does not have the refinement of 'Springtime for Hitler'....",7,3,26,24 December 2019
