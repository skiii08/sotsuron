Whip It," Bend it like Beckham, but without the good, funny or interesting parts.
","When drama is rushed it can feel like the slowest thing in the world. The characters never get any time to breathe. The turmoil that they go through feels so compact, tidy, and meager that it's like your watching nothing at all. The quest for life's answers in the 'missunderstood teenager' way, with the mandatory pushy mother and the quiet but understanding father seems like a subject done before. This movie is way too bland, stale, and unbelievable to really find the heart. I compare it to Bend it like Beckham, but without the good, funny or interesting parts. I liked the idea of this film, it had potential. Ellen Paige is great, as always, but the rest of the cast could have been exchanged for puppets and no on would have been able to tell the difference. I thought the ending too obvious and forced compared to the rest of it, and needed a more inspired and extended premise and execution for fullest success. It seemed rushed and inconsistent with the buildup to it. The movie is, too be frank, about a bunch of girl riding around in circles on rollerskating. And just as exiting as that sounds.",2,13,25,23 June 2010
Train to Busan," Amazing film, one of the best horror films of 2016
","I came across this by accident, and I am so glad I did. This is by far one of the best horror films of 2016. Set on a high speed train traveling through South Korea on just another day, the passengers are trapped inside a fast paced metal coffin of death, along with victims from a virus outbreak. It doesn't take long until the the situation is out of control and people are forced to defend themselves against certain death any way they can. The film is a road-map into the emotions of humans in a crisis. Ans we get to watch in horror as fear and panic claims just as many lives as the infected. We follow a random selection of passengers, but we closely follow the divorced father who has brought his young daughter on the train to visit her mother on her birthday. That movement from train-car to train-car could be a step towards safety just as death, and all the traits that make up who you are could be what saves you or lead to your demise.Amazing performances from the entire cast. Especially from young Soo-an Kim. Cinematography is great and some scenes are nothing short of astonishing. A film that constantly have your heart pounding and doesn't leave you unmoved. A must see for the horror fan.",10,1,4,6 January 2017
The Maze Runner," What did I just watch
","I had no expectations on this film, and it left me with just that. I could might as well watched a tree grow for that amount of time. I felt that they spent most of the films budget on making a huge CGI maze. Rather than getting good actors. Not in one single scene is the acting remotely close to believable. I never care about any of the characters. It's obvious from the first scene who will live and who will die during the film. I never worry about Thomas, nor Newt or Minho. The only interesting thing in the film are the Greivers, that you unfortunately barely see and that they don't develop further. Just like the illness or W.C.K.D are left in the dark, so seems most of the script. It all seems rushed. The film have a few decent looking actions scenes, but nothing worth watching the rest of it. If you want to see kids fighting some obscure monsters, you can watch the last ten minutes of the film. If you are looking for something with more substance, you pick something different to watch. Given that this film should be a mix between Lord of the flies and The Cube. It had potential. It just wasn't good.",2,2,4,8 December 2014
Superbad," They got the name right, it really was super BAD
","There was a major hype around this thing, so I figured 'Oh, maybe there is finally a comedy worth watching, because there haven't been any of them lately...' What can I say, the ad was misleading, making me think there was actually some kind of plot and maybe a reason why I would waste two hours of my life on this film. Instead it's just like any other film you've seen the last ten years. Same thing, same idea, same ending and so on. No real plot, just random segments of stupid people running around making idiots out of themselves and others. And an extensive amount of usage of the f-word. Frankly, I was embarrassed to watch it. It get 2/10 since there was one joke that almost made me smile and the other thing that they should have credit for is the casting. There is not one person in this film that look like the usual pretty-boy/peroxide-girl crew, they all look sort of normal. But that is it. I got the tickets for free, and seriously Seth Rogen, I want my money back.",2,9,25,2 October 2007
Aquaman," Better than I expected it to be, not as good as it ought to be
","After years of DC failures I had no hopes for Aquaman, but to my surprise the film was good. Not as good as you'd expect a film of this magnitude should be, but worth watching. Atleast as a friday night popcorn feature.My main problem with the film is that it doesn't really know what it want to be. As Jason Momoa tries to deliver puns without an ounce of comedic timing it seems more like a childish attempt at trying to be funny, but at the same time the film has so many random events that are darker and dumber than they should be. The scene where two frogmen are in a sinking submarine with one trapped under a heavy object seems beyond stupid as they both have breething equipment and should just wait until the room fills with water to be able to lift the object. Instead one pulls out a grenade and kills himself. Allthough it causes no harm to the submarine. This is to setup just an extra enemy of Aquaman, but one that serve no purpose at all. As he comes and goes, and then goes for good, without causing more than a water ripple in the movie overall.
It makes you wonder how a script like that passes the initial reading.
Same with the scene where Atlanna stands on the docks, I get that it's supposed to be a cool scene, but how long has she been standing there. 20 minutes? 2 hours? This film doesn't know what it want's to be; funny, dark, romantic... and it falls short of all of it.The GCI is amazing though. And the films visuals are worth a view.
Patrick Wilson is great as Orm, and really gives the DCEU a villain that has both depth and clear character motivation. I hope to see more of his character in the future.",7,0,1,1 January 2019
Moana," Nice tunes, OK film
","A good film, with great music.Disney have gotten to the point where they no longer make movies, they make musicals. There have always been songs in Disneys films, but they were to convey something, not to hide the lack of plot. Disney has clearly spent a lot of time on the music, and the obligatory 'I'll tell the audience what I want'-song is great. All the other songs sounds just a bit to much alike, with the exception of Maui's song. The first part of the film is well executed, the background of Moana's life, her relationship with her family and the world around her, hopes, dreams and wishes. It's great and emotional. But from the moment she takes off it feels more like you are watching a few shot films cut together into one. Every section so so disconnected from the rest that the plot is about as great as a 8-bit video game. There is the Disney 'Minions' coconut army. There is the giant singing crab bit. There is the Te Fiti section. That is it! Inbetween those bits you have the same glue-like formula; Maui pushes Moana in the ocean, the ocean brings her back, the chicken is 'derp', Moana talks about Maui's responsibility.I liked the film, but I feel that it had more potential then what was done. The plot is weak and underdeveloped. Moana is the only character that has depth (well she better be since there are barley anyone else in the film). Maui is more of a bully older brother and his behavior gets old really fast. The chicken is a great comic relief, but really serves no purpose other than that through out the whole film. The best part is Moana's relationship with her grandmother, disregard that she comes back like a Jedi, a scene that actually made her previous death less emotional.I don't regret watching the film, but when I look back I don't feel it was really worth going to the movies for. Unless you watch a massive IMAX 3D version, you might as well wait for the Blu-ray to come out.",8,0,3,7 February 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Ok film, but seems more lika a nostagia train back ten years
","Ok film, but seems more lika a nostagia train back ten years rather than adding anything new.
I loved the first Avengers, it had the right mix of action, humour, interesting characters and sstory. This however was a lot of repetiton. If anything it had almost to much resemlenst to Infinity War and didn't add much new. Some scenes just seemed like copy paste, and some of the backtracking seemed unesseary.
The acting was great, the characters are great. The movie held my interest but I wouldn't call it a masterpeice.It was a nice finish to the lineup of movies we have gotten from the MCU the latest 10 years, and I do look forward to seeing more of them.
But as always there are some plotholes that you can't really get past. The fact that noone noticed that Nebula is missing, including her partner who was right infront of her before teleportation. Had they just spent one single minute looking for her they would have noticed she was picked up by Thanos and had been prepared for the entire 3rd act.
The idea that haweye should run the infinity stones into battle with several thousend of Thanos warriors was another thing. Why not keep them safe as far back as possible, call in anyone of the Avengers with some actual skill to keep a sheild around them.
Same with the car, instead of tossing the glove like an american football so that all characters could have their 5 minutes of screentime in the end battle was just dumb, have Strange open up a portal under the car and transport it to the building. Scott, Hope and Shori could work on it, Thor could use his lighning to power it up.
And at the end, the final straw was to watch Tony die from the damages, when Strange could just use the stone right in fron of him to rewind time. He has done it to an apple, so why not save Tony Stark.Theese little things makes the film less enjoyable that it could have been. But it's still a good film and an obvious must for anyone who has seen the others.",7,0,2,27 April 2019
Beauty and the Beast," Water and CGI does not an instant classic make
","As a fan of the original Disney film (Personally I feel it's their masterpiece) I was taken aback to the fact that a new version was in the making. Still excited I had high hopes for the film. Most of was shattered in the first 10 minutes. Campy acting with badly performed singing starts off a long journey holding hands with some of the worst CGI Hollywood have managed to but to screen in ages. A film that is over 50% GCI, should focus on making that part believable, unfortunately for this film, it's far from that. It looks like the original film was ripped apart frame by frame and the beautiful hand-painted drawings have been replaced with digital caricatures. Besides CGI that is bad, it's mostly creepy. As the little teacup boy will give me nightmares for several nights to come. Emma Watson plays the same character as she always does, with very little acting effort and very little conviction as Belle. Although I can see why she was cast in the film based on merits, she is far from the right choice for the role. Dan Stevens does alright under as some motion captured dead-eyed Beast, but his performance feels flat as well. Luke Evans makes for a great pompous Gaston, but a character that has little depth doesn't really make for a great viewing experience. Josh Gad is a great comic relief just like the original movie's LeFou. Other than that, none of the cast stands out enough for me to remember them. Human or CHI creature. I was just bored through out the whole experience. And for a project costing $160 000 000, I can see why the PR department is pushing it so hard because they really need to get some cash back on this pile of wet stinky CGI-fur!All and all, I might be bias from really loving Disney's first adaptation. That for me marks the high-point of all their work, perfectly combining the skills of their animators along with some CGI in a majestic blend. This film however is more like the bucket you wash off your paintbrush in, it has all the same colors, but muddled with water and to thin to make a captivating story from. The film is quite frankly not worth your time, you would be better off watching the original one more time.",1,435,746,16 March 2017
In Time," Like a 70's sci-fi but with better effects
","Time is money. And the movie presents us with a world where the currency is just that. You work to get extra minutes on your life clock. A concept that could have been good...The movie starts with having the main character present us with the facts: Everyone stop aging at 25, you get an extra year on your life displayed on a clock on your arm where the hours, minutes and seconds count down before your eyes, and this is all because some genetic engineering. Our main character doesn't know how this came to be. And we as viewers accept that since it's a movie. After that you follow a story full of plot holes and events that can't be explained.The storyline follow our character who in a twist of fate get more time to spend. And naturally accused of maintaining this time as the result of a crime. He then proceed in taking a hostage, and in true Stockholm- syndrome they go on a Bonny and Clyde rampage believing to be Robin Hood distributing time to who ever they feel deserve it. This movie made me feel like I was watching a sci-fi from the 70's, with the same plot line regarding society as 'bad' and changing it's core structure is the solution to all problems. (Even though the large amount of people left dead in their trails should indicate otherwise) And with a character gallery that is so transparent and one dimensional you start to wonder if the script was written by a high-school student.As for the rating: Cillian Murphy is a great actor, and the clock-effect was nicely done. Due to this the movie get 2/10. (1,5 is more accurate.) This movie took about an hour and a half out of my life and I would like to get that back.",2,1,2,3 October 2012
