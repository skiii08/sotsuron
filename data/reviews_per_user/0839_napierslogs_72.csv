"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Run for this comedy
","'Run, Fatboy, Run' is a comedy, sure there is a romantic subplot, but it's a comedy, and it's funny! The humour isn't highbrow, and there's a lot of sexual innuendo jokes, but the laughs keep coming. Simon Pegg (yes, that is the guy from 'Shaun of the Dead') plays our hero, Dennis. Dennis makes a lot of really bad decisions, but don't we all? We are easily able to laugh at him and cheer him on. As his best friend says to Dennis, 'You left her at the altar when she was pregnant.' Dennis: 'But that was ages ago.' Gordon: 'Women tend to remember that stuff.' We do. It's comedy though when it happens to somebody else. The always funny Hank Azaria plays Libby's new beau, Whit. Azaria is the type of great actor that when we need to root for Dennis, he makes it okay for us to hate Whit.This is a fairly typical comedic romance - not a romantic comedy since its comedy first and slightly more male-oriented. You will know exactly how the movie is going to play out, but it's so funny that the jokes distract you from the fairly lame plot.For those turned off by the title, the writers do know that Simon Pegg isn't exactly fat. As Dennis says, 'I'm not fat, I'm just unfit'. 'Run, Unfit-boy, Run' just doesn't have the same ring to it.'Run, Fatboy, Run' is a good comedy, and it really is appropriate for most ages (a PG-13 rating in most countries).",7,1,2,27 June 2010
The King's Speech," 'The King's Speech' is fit to wear the crown
","'The King's Speech' gave us the story of a man who shouldn't have been King but staunchly rose to the position. Colin Firth was King George VI who had a deeply-rooted, severe stuttering problem. Geoffrey Rush had the perfect touch as his speech therapist. The film was great with its fluidity in telling of the accurate history. It had a few subtle moments connecting with us in the present and the more known history of World War II. But it was even better with its faithful depiction of a lesser known historical story. Rush was perfect as the 'common man' who had to make a connection with the royal monarch, and his perfect amount of comedy allowed us, also the common man, to connect with both him and the little boy still shaking with fear who was the future King. As usual, the British independent film community has come forth with a film fit to wear the crown as one of the best films of the year.",9,0,1,27 December 2010
Moneyball," More than a game of numbers
","It has long been said that professional sports are more a game of politics than an actual game. Major League Baseball is not just a game of money, but in 'Moneyball' it's a game of numbers versus a game of people. It's callousness at its highest when general managers trade away people as if they're objects with little regard for them or their family. Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, the GM of the Oakland As, seems to take that even further, treating people as if they are only numbers, and yet there was something refreshing and humanistic about the whole thing.It's 2001 and Oakland has just lost to the New York Yankees in the playoffs, not surprising, seeing as their payroll was 76 Million dollars less. The humour of 'Moneyball' starts in the off-season when the team can't afford to keep their top players and Beane and his experienced scouts start tossing around some free agent ideas. One guy is no good because he frequents strip clubs too often, another guy is no good because his girlfriend is ugly, and on down the list they go. But then Beane meets Yale-educated, economics-, mathematics-, and computer-whiz, baseball fan, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). He has no experience and he doesn't know these players. He doesn't know if they stand funny or if they swing ugly. He only knows their stats and their salary. A lot of people took offense to Beane's approach of degrading players down to the sum total of their on-base percentage and runs-in potential. But I liked it. Since the game of baseball isn't changing any time soon and players will always just be elements that can help win games and make more money, why not view them as numbers rather than as people with ugly girlfriends? Like Peter Brand, I like numbers. It's a movie about doing more with less, so I think we're just supposed to ignore the irony that they needed an excessively high budget to make it. In fact, it cost Sony Pictures more money to make this movie than it cost the Oakland A's to field their entire team for a season. Oh well, only one lesson for Hollywood at a time, and I still liked the movie.For a movie about people trying to change the game of baseball, it's only fitting that they are changing the sports genre. This isn't about the team and how many games they're going to win. As in all cases, they win some and they lose some. And we really only meet one player, the rest are just names thrown in the air. The movie is about Billy Beane, a real person, and a multi-dimensional character. At first he realizes that he is going to have to play the game with more than just money, and then after he makes it about numbers too, he finds a balanced statistical and personal concept.'Moneyball' says that the game is about money, but the movie is about people. Writer Aaron Sorkin knows how to write people, and as evidenced by 'The Social Network' (2010), he also knows how to turn computer-programming into riveting cinema. We find humour in the least-expected of places, we find heart in the least-expected of people, and 'Moneyball' gives us a completely enjoyable movie that becomes so much more than numbers.",9,110,130,1 October 2011
Black Swan," Visually arresting, but morally and essentially empty
","Natalie Portman is the Swan Queen. She is the White Swan who becomes the Black Swan through her own ambitions mixed with insecurity.'Black Swan' is a good film because Darren Aronofsky made it so visually enchanting, he made it a film that I couldn't turn away from. Natalie Portman really is the best actress of the year, if not the decade. She made her character of Nina Sayers, the hopeful ballerina, dark, interesting and all-encompassing. And Vincent Cassel who plays the depraved, arrogant artistic director, actually made me question if his sleaziness was an act or who he really was.The 7 stars is actually quite generous, it could easily be 2. The story is over-used and completely predictable and the few elements that were added to make it more daring, like female eroticism, just make it seem like it should be a porno film.'Black Swan' is a film to be experienced, but if you're not interested in run-of-the-mill psychological thrillers with girl-on-girl action, then it is certainly not the best film of the year.",7,5,14,19 December 2010
The Monuments Men," Telling an historical story comedically and missing a level of entertainment
","'The Monuments Men' is a group of men (in real life around 350, and in this film 7) who are tasked with saving the historically and culturally significant monuments, fine arts and archives during World War II. They have to find and return that which the French hid and the Germans were finding and stealing and then hiding. And the film decided to tell this story comedically.The film took a really long time to get going as they wanted it to be about the men that took on this task. But they changed their names and I also couldn't tell you a single characteristic of any of them. The men were paired off so they each had their own region to investigate, but none of that was interesting. The worst part was giving James Granger (Matt Damon) and Claire Simon (Cate Blanchett, representing the real- life heroine Rose Valland) a love story. They did have a reason for such nonsense, or how about just sticking with how it actually happened.George Clooney has said the film is about 80% accurate, and that seems fair enough. But the problem isn't the historical inaccuracy; the problem is that the cheap humour diminishes the very people and story they're trying to empower. The humour was just a handful of lines wanting to kill Hitler and standing on a landmine. It just didn't make the film entertaining. The story could have done that but it didn't become interesting until they started discovering where the Germans hid the art. Coincidentally, the same point when the film started following the real story.'The Monuments Men' very clearly wanted to help remember an important part of history and spark a debate about the cost of war on soldiers, civilians, and history and society. The debate is raging on, but the film missed the level of entertainment by not trusting its audience to be interested in exactly what happened.",5,209,275,8 February 2014
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Uplifting teenage drama with humour, heart and soul
","'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is self-adapted from Steven Chbosky's novel of the same name. While I frequently like reading the novel first to gain more insight into the art of the adaptation, and also to read good books, I stayed clear from this one since it was written as a series of letters. The protagonist writes one letter after another and such works can seem choppy at best. As a film, letter writing can be a useful tool to understand the inner turmoil of characters and here Perks feels very fluid.Charlie (Logan Lerman) suffers from mental illness resulting from the death of his best friend and a childhood incident with his aunt that is purposely left ambiguous until the very end. Entering high school, Charlie is an outsider until he makes friends with Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller), examples of the titular 'Wallflower'. Sam is definitely too pretty and Patrick is likely too funny and charismatic to not be the most popular kids in school, but it really is a good movie, so we let that go.The best part (and I will eventually start sounding like a broken record if he keeps acting and I keep reviewing) went to Ezra Miller. First he gets his name changed to 'Nothing' and then he takes our mentally- damaged hero under his wing and then his flamboyant homosexuality gets him in love and trouble. Lerman's Charlie might be the eyes to the movie but Miller's Patrick is the heart and soul and humour to everything that 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is.'Perks' is a dramedy. Superficially, Patrick provides the comedy and Charlie and Sam provide the drama. But the movie works on both a superficial level and multiple layers deep. The quickest way to one's heart is generally through humour, so that's mostly how the movie starts. Patrick gets us laughing, and then Sam gets us falling in love and before we know it, we're emotionally invested in Charlie and realize that he is more disturbed than the rest of us outsiders are. The childhood incident with the aunt is one such instance that could remove us from Charlie but they only give us hints to what occurred up until the very end, and by then we're all best friends. The multiple layers works well with this incident. Those who dig deep into ambiguous hints can guess early on, while those who are visually adept at understanding the meaning that editing can add to a movie will figure it out next, while the rest will eventually be told. This is just one such example of using editing, flashbacks, and music to enliven all elements of the story.The dialogue can get a little too clever for the ages of the characters. I always get frustrated when teenage smart-alecks start philosophizing about what combination of religions best represent them. Mae Whitman is left to fend for herself as her character is described as 'a really nice person underneath the parts of her that hate everybody'. I only saw the hate. The rest of the main characters are all very lovely and are getting their deserved accolades.'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is a touching and dramatic people- pleaser. It appears to be a hit with all audiences. So much so, that my theatre shortened the name on the marquee to 'Being a Wall' and the movie was still sold out.",7,1,2,14 January 2013
Source Code," Hero tries to save the world and get the girl, but loses track of which world it is in the first place
","'Source Code' is a movie about trains blowing up, but with far more intelligence put into it than explosive action. The former is why I didn't see it at first, the latter is why I finally had to. Another movie that belongs to the science fiction romance genre. Heavy on the science fiction, light on the romance.Jake Gyllenhaal stars as a U.S. Army colonel who only knows where he should have been: in Afghanistan on a helicopter mission. He doesn't know where he is now: in some cell after a bomb on a train was detonated. The movie tells us everything we need to know about this new world he's in and the mission he's on. The description of this science fiction world was thought out way more than most Holllywood movies attempt. I appreciated that.The best part of 'Source Code' was Jake Gyllenhaal and his character. He completely stayed in character, and the film managed to always keep the character in check. I felt for him, and I, too, wanted him to save the world and get the girl. The worst part, was the three or four endings that dragged on way too long. Hollywood couldn't just let a good movie be, they had to add multiple twists which undid the story they were trying to tell.'Source Code' exists in a world where terrorists plant bombs, the hero tries to win the girl, and after awhile, things just stop making sense. Oddly enough it sounds like the real world, but it doesn't have to be. If only they knew to leave well enough alone.",7,0,1,30 April 2011
The Hangover," From nowhere to Las Vegas and answered the funniest questions ever asked
","The Vegas comedy done right. Mostly because 'The Hangover' is actually funny. Very funny. As the guys start out on their bachelor party trip to Las Vegas we quickly get a sense of how funny this will be because of the sense of humour the characters have. Phil (Bradley Cooper) is completely unscrupulous, but that's okay he's only a school teacher. Alan (Zach Galifianakis) thinks the prospect of killing someone or being killed is absolutely hilarious.Their tame night becomes morning and questions need to be answered. In order of increasing severity: Whose baby is in the mini-fridge? Why is there a tiger in the bathroom? Will Alan put his pants on? And where is Doug? Finding Doug will answer the other questions but it will also take all day and all night and raise more questions that need answering.This works because we want to find the answers. The questions which we start with are just so outrageous, original and intriguing that we know they will be funny. Along the way we also want to find Doug. He's the sane and normal one so surely our world will be righted once we find him.'The Hangover' achieved greatness because people weren't expecting it. Hollywood didn't produce it, so to the masses, it came out of nowhere. It made Bradley Cooper a movie star, Zach Galifianakis a fearless comedian and gave Ed Helms the respect he deserved. I'm hoping Part II will do the same for Justin Bartha, but it's hard to come out of nowhere after Hollywood has hyped it for two years.",8,1,2,24 May 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Torturous and good(?) Tarantino
","'Inglourious Basterds' is Quentin Tarantino. At his best? Perhaps.It has in-your-face violence with left-field characters. I expected that, and I got that. I don't like Tarantino because of the extreme violence and the absurdity of situations that his characters get themselves into. I am usually confident with my decisions to avoid his movies. But here, I became increasingly restless, with it being a comedy, starring Brad Pitt, and all of its award nominations, including Best Screenplay? What? It's one of those films that deserves its accolades, but it still doesn't mean it's good. I certainly didn't like it, but I watched the full two and a half hours. It's like a World War II epic, and told very slowly. But every time I had enough with a scene, Tarantino knew to switch up the narrative, so I kept watching. The story narratives changed often enough to keep me watching but not too often to get confusing. I will admit, that's good writing.I got frustrated with the characters because I didn't know them well enough, but that is classic Tarantino. Violence, although necessary at times, was used way too heavily - again, that's classic Tarantino. There was just no sign of comedy, maybe a few non-sense lines for humour, but come on, this is World War II. I'm not one for being offended, but I don't find war particularly funny.'Inglourious Basterds' is Quentin Tarantino mastering what he is good at. For those that like him, this is a quality film experience, but for others like me, just because you can sit through two and a half hours of torture, doesn't mean it's good.",5,5,10,14 July 2010
This Is the End," How to make a stoner comedy with a bunch of friends and turn it into a smart, shrewd and hilarious statement on humanity
","A vanity project for a bunch of Hollywood's highest paid comedic actors, playing themselves in a 'stoner comedy'. So how do you make that good? By making it an hilarious, smart, insightful, satirical and scathing commentary on religion, celebrity and Los Angeles. And how do you make that successful? By making it a stoner comedy about a hapless group of actors saying and doing the stupidest things.It actually starts out pretty slowly with a lame story being introduced. Jay Baruchel comes to LA to hang out with his friend Seth Rogen who wants to hang out with his friends James Franco, Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson, but Jay doesn't like his friends and he doesn't think that they like him. Sounds kind of lame doesn't it? The party at James Franco's house delivers the ridiculous, raunchy comedy which the target audience craves but it doesn't yet include the intelligence which the rest of the audience is applauding.It seems like everybody in Hollywood is at James Franco's house. Michael Cera is doing coke, Jonah Hill is being friendly and everybody else is finding another drug to imbibe. While Jay and Seth are off to buy cigarettes, the Heavens open up and the Earth caves in. And then the real fun begins. Knowing the title of the film, or having read the bible, or really having seen any loose interpretation of the apocalypse, it's pretty obvious what is happening. And we get our first glimpse of the film's take on the celebrity culture and what it does (and what will eventually happen) to those at the center of it.Our heroes aren't quite sure what's going on. Remember, they are actors in Hollywood. It's probably an earthquake, or it could be a zombie invasion, or it could be the end of the world as described in the New Testament's Revelation. But who believes that stuff?The majority of the film takes place with our five actors holed up in James Franco's house – which is like a cement cave designed by himself since he's an artist. The jokes are vulgar, crass, silly but also incredibly insightful into who they are and the result is a perfectly written self-parody. You have to get past a lot of penis jokes, but once you do, you'll find an under-current tackling the issues of celebrity status but also of celebrities' biggest detractors, the religious congregation. I don't think 'This Is the End' will be successfully duplicated any time soon, but I also don't foresee the apocalypse hitting any time soon.",8,14,29,16 June 2013
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is very funny, and with actual, real characters
","'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is the low-end, crass comedy that we have come to expect from Judd Apatow and company. This one is written by Jason Segal and it's hilarious. The comedy is crude, vulgar and rude, but that doesn't really lessen the quality of the film because it's so well written.The film gives us real, three-dimensional characters whom we can all relate to and learn from as we laugh at them for two straight hours. Segal is Peter a struggling musician who is trying to get over the heartbreak caused by Sarah Marshall, the famous actress. And we can all relate to the pain and humour of Peter watching her with famous singer Aldous Snow (Russell Brand).There are a lot of comedic actors, and they can all make you laugh. 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is very funny, male-centric comedic romance that is pure comedy, with actual characters as an added bonus. I recommend it.",9,1,5,15 October 2010
Argo," Marriage of history and entertainment as Argo becomes a run-away hit.
","'Argo' starts with the history of the Iran hostage crisis of 1979 when Islamist students and militants stormed the American Embassy in Tehran and 6 American diplomats escaped with their lives and found temporary salvation in the home of the Canadian Ambassador. It was enough history to educate us but not too much to lose viewer's interest. Like most stories in this world, things start getting entertaining when the film moves to Hollywood.To rescue the 6 trapped Americans, the CIA is going to make a fake movie set in Iran. At this point we get the comedy. Alan Arkin and John Goodman make jokes about the state of Hollywood; Bryan Cranston ensures us that 'This is the best bad idea we've got, sir.' Once the history is out of the way and the film has us laughing, then Ben Affleck as both lead actor and director lead us into thriller territory. The editing in the final stretches of the film, while veering away from reality, make us question everything we thought we knew about the event and keeps white knuckles gripped to the theatre seats as 'Argo' becomes a heart-wrenching thriller. Each beat of the score matches each step down the run-way which matches our heart beats in a cinematic marriage of history and entertainment. It is not surprising that 'Argo' quickly became a box-office hit, a critical darling and an awards season favourite.The Canadian Ambassador at the time complained that Canadians weren't given enough recognition for their role. While some American viewers complained that Canadians got too much credit. Why can't we all just agree and say 'Argo' was almost perfect?",9,0,1,18 January 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Twisting your standard romantic comedy into something that's hilarious and refreshing
","Love is the be-all and end-all of life. It's crazy, it's stupid, but you have to put everything towards winning over your soul-mate. That is what all of the characters believe. Except Jacob (Ryan Gosling). He believes that people who are in love are pathetic. Thank God for Ryan Gosling. I've been saying that a lot recently, but it's true. He makes everything he's in better.Here, he wants to improve Cal (Steve Carell). Cal's wife (Julianne Moore) has announced she wants a divorce, so he jumps out of the car and winds up at a very swanky bar. The bar is basically Jacob's turf where he knows how to win over all women and get them to sleep with him. Disgusted by Cal's pathetic demeanor, we then get a man-makeover.The best part of this movie is that they make everything funny. From divorce, to objectifying women, to inappropriate soul-mates, to depression, everything is funny. It's not darkly comic or making you laugh out of awkwardness, but taking real situations and making them genuinely funny. I frequently found myself laughing just waiting for Gosling's next line. His comedic chemistry between both Carell and Emma Stone was perfect.Analeigh Tipton, a young Liv Tyler-type actress, plays the babysitter with the inappropriate crush, but I liked her. She added another layer to the role with a little bit of sassiness and a fresh take to the character.'Crazy, Stupid, Love.' is supposed to be your standard romantic comedy, where you know exactly what you're getting. But it is directed by the comic geniuses behind 'I Love You Phillip Morris' and 'Bad Santa', and you should know by that that this really isn't all the predictable. It has twists. I know, a romantic comedy with twists! They're inventive, fun, and most importantly, hilarious.",8,4,9,29 July 2011
The Notebook," Love for the characters provides real emotion to the romantic drama
","A love story for the ages; a weepy romantic drama; a timeless love story. All the exhausted clichés apply, but 'The Notebook' manages to turn them into something substantial—emotionally at least, if not intellectually. Everything in this movie is beautiful and it's easy to get wrapped up into the story.Noah (Ryan Gosling) loves Allie (Rachel McAdams). That's basically the entire story, but conflicts arise when Allie's parents insist he's not good enough for her, and Noah has to spend the rest of his life winning her back. I love both Noah and Allie. Allie, because she's the type of girl that every girl can realistically see themselves as; she's emotional, but smart and passionate, and adorable in every way. And Noah, because he has this boyish charm that he never loses. Gosling has this incredible ability to play men at any and every point in their lives.Because the characters are just so captivating, the story is able to invoke emotion. You'll fall in love when they do, you'll be heart-broken when they are, and you'll cry when they do. 'The Notebook' is beautifully shot, beautifully told, and most importantly, beautifully acted. And it's for those reasons that it is able to rise above the rather tired and painfully predictable plot. You won't even notice that because you'll be crying and falling in love.",8,0,1,31 May 2011
The Girl Next Door," 'The Girl Next Door' raises the teen sex comedy genre
","Matt is a studious, hard-working high school senior bound for Georgetown University. Then he meets the girl next door and all hell breaks loose.'The Girl Next Door' is the type of film that gently breaks down the door of a genre. Take your typical teen comedy with geeks hanging out in the A/V room, guys being obsessed with meeting porn stars, with some contrived plot which allows for breasts galore and lots of lame sex jokes. But this film sees that bet and raises it. It has your geeks obsessed with meeting porn stars, but it also has an actually well-written good comedy story, which then allows for breasts galore and some mild sex jokes.Emile Hirsch is the perfect actor for the role of Matt. He's handsome so women will love to watch him, but not too handsome that men will want to watch him too. After this, his peers started watching him and he's been getting accolades for his talent.'The Girl Next Door' is for everybody getting frustrated with the poor state of teen comedies. You can watch this without hanging your head in shame.",9,3,4,1 July 2010
Ted," Offensive, wrong and childish, 'Ted' is hilarious and then it becomes a Hollywood rom-com
","The great thing about 'Ted' is that they know their target audience. And they hooked us from the very beginning. It starts with a fairly well written narration about how in 1984 on Christmas eve, all the Boston kids would gather together and beat up the Jewish kid, and then the next morning they would open their presents. One little girl got a Cabbage Patch Kid — the identical one which I got on the exact same morning. They had similar clips for the rest of the audience.John (Mark Wahlberg) got Ted, a teddy bear, who became a real, live teddy bear. 'A Christmas miracle, just like baby Jesus.' That should give you a sense of what the humour is like. It's blasphemous, homophobic, racist and culturally offensive. For those who don't get offended easily it's actually pretty funny.As John grows up and Ted becomes famous (he is a walking, talking teddy bear after all) they settle down for a life filled with childish behaviour and lots of pot. One morning, John is too stoned to drive to work, but behind a blue haze of marijuana smoke, Ted says it's okay, he can. And so he does. I couldn't help myself but laugh.A lot of people seemed to be delighted by the fact that there was a story to the movie 'Ted'; somehow expecting that there wasn't going to be one. As much as Hollywood would prefer to not have to tell a story, they always at least try. But don't let the fact that there is a story confuse you into thinking it's a good one. It's not. It's a simple romantic comedy about a guy who can't grow into a man because as long as he has a teddy bear he will always be a kid. That is paraphrased directly from the movie.The novelty of the humour does wear off as the story builds up. Most of the lines remain funny, but I would like to think that they could have made the plot funny too. An element which makes 'Horrible Bosses' (2011) a better movie than this.Wahlberg essentially plays himself, minus the singing ability, so he was very natural but his reactions weren't as funny as in 'I Heart Huckabees' or some of his other comedies. Giovanni Ribisi, on the other hand, does not play himself – I hope! And he hasn't been funnier. He plays that creepy guy from the park with the kid who could be his son or who may be his lover.Some scenes I was a bit too creeped out to laugh, some scenes were so damn funny that I couldn't help but laugh, and some scenes should have been made funnier. Which is probably what most people would expect to get out of a movie like 'Ted'.",7,1,3,8 July 2012
127 Hours," More bold adventure film, less soulful drama
","Based on the true, survival-against-all-odds story 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place', James Franco is Aron Ralston, and he is literally stuck between a rock and a hard place—a canyon wall in the Utah desert to be more exact. '127 Hours' records the time from when Aron finds himself stranded and trapped alone in a canyon, and has to use everything that he is mentally and physically capable of to try and get himself free.I found it very similar to 'Touching the Void' (2003) and 'Into the Wild' (2007). Here, Danny Boyle captures the Utah desert in all its glory (and its few fauna and flora), James Franco in his many stages of anguish and loneliness, and his extreme adventurous nature, complete with lots of loud techno music.Franco is expected to be in the running for the Best Actor Oscar, but I'm still trying to figure out how Emile Hirsch didn't receive the nomination for the aforementioned 'Into the Wild'. I think Boyle wanted to make this more of a bold adventure film rather than a soulful drama, so there were moments with quick, flashy editing and pumping music, and occasions for drug-like hallucinations. That's what depreciated the value of '127 Hours' for me, but it is still a spectacular story of the human will.",8,3,8,26 November 2010
Pirate Radio," Ultimately disappointing
","Pirate Radio is set during one of the most interesting times in music history. Rock music was banned yet grew into immense popularity. The political implications to music during this time period is just amazing, resulting in pirate radios off-shore, and the crossing of the pond for some of the most important bands in music history.My problem with this movie is that they didn't really cover any of that. They started to, we did see some of the politics, but mostly this was just a fictional, coming-of-age story set to rock music.A soundtrack of the popular music of the period is not enough to make this a good movie. Especially when they got the rights to the most interesting period of music politics, and they chose to focus on fictional characters. I was very disappointed because this movie had great potential.If you are like me and are looking for a movie that delves deep into the political and historical implications of the popularity of rock music, then I recommend you don't see this movie. But if you're just looking for a fun, 60s rock movie with sex, drugs and rock n' roll and everything that implies, then this would probably be a pretty good movie for you.",5,4,8,16 May 2010
Hot Fuzz," Better than 'Point Break'!?!
","For those of us who know that 'Point Break' (1991) isn't the greatest movie of all time, we have 'Hot Fuzz'. And we get to side with Simon Pegg who should become one of the greatest comedic actors, in North America, if he isn't that already in the UK.Pegg is a hardened police officer from London who is transferred to the sleepy village of Sanford. Most of the other officers don't believe crime occurs here, or if it does, won't report on it. The one crime that does get reported is when a swan escapes from a lake. But Pegg playing against-type is action-ready and quickly becomes attuned to everything going on in the town.It's no accident that 'Hot Fuzz' has a high average IMDb rating of 8.0. It's inventively funny with a humorous and active plot. It's not as explosive and violent as the poster suggests, definitely comedy first. 'Hot Fuzz' also has a wide appeal and should work for many ages and lovers of any genre.",8,2,3,28 November 2010
Just Go with It," Not a good romantic comedy, but it is funny and romantic
","'Just Go with It' has Adam Sandler trying his hand at his ladies man shtick rather than his immature man-child routine. The result is a somewhat mature (not to be confused with intelligent) romantic comedy, rather than a zany screwball comedy. I like most romantic comedies no matter how pedantic and unoriginal they may be as long as they are funny and romantic too. And this one is all of the above.Danny (Adam Sandler) has long since discovered that a wedding ring and a sob story can go a long way towards picking up women. But then he meets Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) and she's supposed to be different. We can't actually tell why she's more special than the others, they just have to tell us that since subtlety is not a strong point here. The best part about Decker, the 20-something model, is that she gets showed up by Jennifer Aniston, who in turn, gets half-showed up by Nicole Kidman. There's something almost poetic about Hollywood's universe inadvertently becoming backwards.'Just Go with It' is as predictable as they get and far from original but it kept me amused and Sandler's light humour kept me smiling. It certainly isn't a good romantic comedy (which, believe it or not, does exist), but it was exactly as I expected it to be. I enjoyed it, but then again I like Jennifer Aniston and I think Adam Sandler is funny.",7,3,7,13 June 2011
Orphan," A different kind of horror movie
","I don't like horror films, but 'Orphan' was different. It was written well enough to be able to hold my sense of disbelief and keep me suspensed.In this horror film we actually have characters. Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard) have two kids, Daniel and Max, and they all have back-stories that are significant to the film, and they each struggle with who they are and how to grow as individuals and as a family. Then they adopt Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). All we know is that there's something wrong with Esther.Esther greatly disrupts the family's life - with a lot of violence and psychosis. Don't forget this is a horror film. Although that is easy to forget because the plot is driven by characters - perhaps a first for this genre? The characters are integral to a story that was so well researched that it's actually legit. That fact probably makes it even scarier.Even if you don't watch horror films, you could start with 'Orphan'.",7,6,10,10 July 2010
Juno," Can't live up to its undeserving expectations
","The problem with 'Juno' is Juno. Juno (Ellen Page) is our main character, a high school teenager that gets pregnant. Shenanigans, as she says, emanate.I adhere to the school of thought that in film, main characters should be likable, or that we can at least relate to or empathize with in some way, but Juno doesn't inhabit any qualities of a good character. She is not similar to any real high school teenagers, and has that ultra-cool, I'm-smarter-and-better-than-everybody-else vibe that young adults only wish they were like. We are to know that Juno is really, really smart – (just ignore the fact that she accidentally got pregnant) – we can tell by her speech. Unfortunately, the dialogue is not smart writing. It's just pop-culture persiflage and quick witted repartee. It may be funny, but it's not smart - especially when no actual teenagers talk like that. Then, to hide the fact that Juno is not a complete character, they have her listen to cool, indie music. But someone must have forgotten to tell writer Diablo Cody that listening to cool, indie music does not automatically add dimension or emotion to a character. That's supposed to be done through a character's actions, reactions as they evolve over the course of the film. None of which are demonstrated in Juno. To be clear, for all of the faults with the character of Juno, none of the blame is to be placed on Ellen Page. Unanimously heralded to be the next great actress, that is just a matter of time.Apart from the lack of an integral character in Juno, the film certainly has some positives. Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons play Juno's step-mother and father. They could very well be the best parents displayed in the teen, pregnancy genre. Janney adds depth and humour to a character that turns out to be not your cliché step-mother; while Simmons adds heart and humour to a father that steers clear of melodrama but can still provide the adjective 'heartfelt' to the film. Also starring Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner, who are both accomplished actors, their characters are exactly as you expect them to be. Which are fine characters, but they don't provide the platforms for Juno's supposed maturation.If it weren't for the fact that 'Juno' was the recipient of an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for screenwriter Diablo Cody, it would have been forgotten as just a flash-in-the-pan with some funny lines and a young Ellen Page. But just as America fell to the charms of its marketing team, the Academy fell to the charms of another stripper-turned-screenwriter, and we have a sub-par film getting lauded as one of the best ever. 'Juno' may have some good acting, and great supporting characters and humour and heart, but from everything pointed above it's lacking too much to be deserving of its Best Original Screenplay win. A year later, the Academy snubbed John Patrick Shanley's 'Doubt' – now that's a film with complex, multi-dimensional characters and layers of meaning into a seemingly simple story. 'Juno' doesn't even come close to that kind of brilliant writing. (Normally such a comparison can not be made but when they are nominated for the same award and both attempt a multi-meaning story arc with engaging characters the comparison somehow becomes valid but of course not fair).Watch 'Juno' if you like the teen comedy, pregnancy kind of film and enjoy it for what it offers, but don't expect it to live up to its hype.",4,5,14,9 July 2010
Midnight in Paris," Paris and literature taken to golden heights of intelligence and humour
","Have you ever wanted to see Owen Wilson play a modern day Alvy Singer and then transport him into the 1920s? I'm assuming that nobody other than Woody Allen has even thought about doing that. But trust me, now you'll want to see it. 'Midnight in Paris' pairs ingenious casting with Allen's usual parade of characters (a neurotic writer, a right-wing Republican ignoramus, and a pedantic know-it-all) and places them in Paris.Woody Allen movies are typically described as a love affair with the city, but this one is just so much more. It's not just a love affair with Paris, but with the romanticism of Paris, and with the idea of the best years of the city, and a love affair that is too crazy to be real that we don't even call it cheating.Here we get a romantic comedy, and at the beginning, one that appears that it could be a very standard romantic comedy. But we flirt with philosophical notions of loving and living in the past, and of wanting to live in a time that has past, and then we heavily flirt and engage with the golden-age of literature. That's where the intelligence, education and Allen's pure intellect come in, but he makes it hilarious, not heavy.'Midnight in Paris' is, quite literally, one of the smartest and funniest movies I have ever seen. It's almost as smart as 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' (1989) and just as funny as 'Annie Hall' (1977). It will take a few more years and viewings before I can officially place it in that order of Woody Allen's best films, which for the most part is the same as the World's best films. But after the best night out at the cinema I have ever had, I have no doubt that's where 'Midnight in Paris' will go.",10,8,16,18 June 2011
The Last Song," Only Kinnear is good and he makes it funny and dramatic
","I was wary but still optimistic about 'The Last Song' and Miley Cyrus's foray into drama. But, oh, I was disappointed. She needs to stick to 'Hannah Montana' and similar romantic comedies. The film's opening with Cyrus as the misunderstood, rebellious teenage daughter was just painful to watch.Not being familiar with the book, I wasn't expecting this film to be as dramatic as it was. There was more than just Cyrus and her summer love storyline. Her interactions with her father (Greg Kinnear) were funny, heartwarming, touching, mature, and sincere. That is mostly credit to Kinnear's natural ability. He's genuinely funny and honestly dramatic. His character always comes across exactly as he's supposed to. Perhaps Greg Kinnear is the next great actor of his generation? I'll certainly be watching more to find out.The movie on the whole, was all rather safe and inconsequential. The development of Cyrus's character was very obvious and expected; the ups and downs in her summer love relationship were rather pathetic; and although her relationship with her father deepened quicker than it was supposed to, that at least was enjoyable and kept me watching the film. Kinnear fans are not the target audience for 'The Last Song' but his talent makes this film watchable.",6,2,7,22 September 2010
Cloverfield," Not a movie, just a home video
","I have yet to figure out how 'Cloverfield' is a movie, it's just a home video.And no, I'm not just insulting it. It really is a home video. The 'characters' are introduced to us through way of home video shots at a party. I'm assuming the film-makers thought this would make me feel more connected to the so-called characters, but it did the opposite. I was more distanced and I didn't care about them, worse than that, after so long of this party nonsense, I didn't care who the characters were anymore. But then something happens.The something was some kind of disaster that they weren't sure about at the beginning. Could be an earthquake, or could be some external presence. But remember this is all shot as a home video. Can you imagine what your home video would look like if an earthquake or some other disaster occurred? Yes, that's right, not much was captured. Lots of feet shots and screams of 'what's going on?'.The whole 'movie' was pretty much shaky shots of people screaming and then shots of the ground as they start running. But you couldn't expect much more from a home video.",1,7,12,6 September 2010
Once," 'Once' is most likely for music lovers only
","'Once' is a beautiful independent film made in very little time and on very little money. That alone almost makes this film worth watching. The love that this filmmaker has for music and music in film is evident. Unfortunately, there is no good story past the music. I don't care all that much for music and have no great affinity for music in film. This movie offers you nothing more. The writing and acting were not great and I found nothing enjoyable in it.Music lovers unite, you have most likely found a wonderful film, but for those expecting more, beware of the melodic front. Because I couldn't get into the music, I couldn't get into this film.",3,15,27,1 January 2008
Horrible Bosses," Adding crude and sexual content to make a plot-rich story funny
","In the vein of 'The Hangover' (2009), 'Horrible Bosses' has three friends taking a wild trip to—well, jail, most likely. They mean well, but when you spend your free time drinking at a bar complaining about your bosses, reckless plans are bound to be hatched. But I'm glad they do. It's a premise with lots of possibilities, never quite knowing which turns they would take, and they were all hilarious.The wild heights they reach are mostly with profanity and sexual explicitness. In fact, there's an entire scene about where the 'line' is and if they've crossed it. As you can guess, that line has long since been crossed, re-drawn and repeatedly crossed.At the beginning we meet our three protagonists, Nick (Jason Bateman), Dale (Charlie Day) and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) working in decent jobs but for crazy assholes. Their bosses all have titles, but it would be wrong of me to string that many expletives together.They're not being serious about killing their bosses, but before we know it they're putting together haphazard, drunken plans. It's the type of story that seems plausible at first but then somewhere along the way, we don't really know where, reality is thrown out the window. It's an R-rated comedy where the plot is central, characters are secondary but still important, and last but not least there are funny lines. For that, it's smart.The dark comedy works because of the ensemble of characters, the three hapless adventurists and their really horrible bosses, each played by actors who can say comedy lines with straight faces and aren't scared to get dirty. Some are just really good and what they normally do, like Bateman as the normal, straight man and Sudeikis as the obnoxious womanizer. While others are stepping out of their comfort zone and showing some real comedy skills, like Jennifer Aniston as an over-the-top, inappropriate seductress and Colin Farrell as a skinny, coked-out criminal. Kevin Spacey, equally adept at comedy and drama, is of course great here. I don't know Charlie Day all that well but he made me laugh in 'Going the Distance' and he made me laugh really hard here. His whiny voice is perfect for the role of Dale because he's manic and paranoid to begin with but with his head in a bowl of cocaine he's going to need to become even more manic and paranoid.'Horrible Bosses' is more silly than it is dark as the crimes occur after we've been removed from reality. But it's also as funny as pure comedies come. This is one of those movies that need to be as profane and sexually explicit as it is. 'Horrible Bosses' does it all with plot and jokes which are inventive and funny.",8,3,6,8 July 2011
The Town," Thoughtful, character-driven crime drama thriller
","Take a crime-ridden community with gritty streets but with young men trying to get to a better life and the hopefulness of a possible romance, and you get 'The Town', a thoughtful and discerning dramatic thriller.Going beyond 'Gone Baby Gone' (2008), Ben Affleck has created an extremely well done film. Yes, it's a crime thriller, but better than that, it has real characters who each have their own motives. Most of the advancements in the plot are done rather subtly, and they are also mostly character-driven. And that's the sign of a great crime thriller.'The Town' should be in the running for all the major awards of the season. Affleck, Rebecca Hall, and Jeremy Renner all portrayed interesting characters that had their own reasons for getting into and out of the town full of crime. 'The Town' is one of the best crime dramas made, especially for those wanting to see more acumen, consideration and distinction in the genre.",9,1,2,19 December 2010
Shutter Island," Shutter Island is at the top of its genre
","Martin Scorsese has done it again. He pays attention to every detail in this film, making 'Shutter Island' one of the best suspense thrillers of all time.Visually intriguing, simplistic and absolutely phenomenal. The story is kept simplistic enough so it doesn't get absurd, but allows for an ending which you probably won't see coming. The film doesn't go for cheap thrills, so although you will be on the edge of your seat you won't get needlessly scared.The film uses everything at its disposal from breathtaking scenery, to detailed laid-out shots, and to actors at their finest to completely engross you in the film. I loved every minute of it and highly recommend it to everyone. Even if you're not a usual fan of the genre, this film has so much more to it.",9,158,199,22 May 2010
Trouble with the Curve," One great character, good comedic chemistry, but many simple turns
","'Trouble with the Curve' starts with Gus (Clint Eastwood) and his curmudgeonly ways going about his job as a baseball scout. The jokes about being old and losing his sight and getting up to pee in the middle of the night aren't very funny, but the introduction of John Goodman as his boss and best friend, and then Amy Adams as his daughter Mickey, help heighten the level of jokes.Gus is off to North Carolina to scout the next home run-hitting phenom; Pete tells Mickey to join him since he's concerned about his health and abilities. The good news for the majority of people is that this movie is not about baseball, it's a simple family dramedy. I would have liked more baseball, but I also would have liked accurate baseball. No professional team (in this case the Atlanta Braves) is going to send only one old, partially-blind, disrespected scout to draft their number 1 pick. But that is better than the Boston Red Sox who sent one immature, inexperienced, junior temporary scout to draft their number 1 pick. That honour went to Johnny (Justin Timberlake) who is really only there to be the love interest for Mickey.The next problem with the film is the very simplistic approach to the supporting characters. The young prospect is a douche-bag and the title tells us why we're supposed to not like him. The fellow scouts are douche-bags because they believe the opposite of what Gus does, so obviously we can't like them either. The one 'twist' is clearly telegraphed with an otherwise pointless scene and added sound effects to make sure we don't miss the significance.But the film is still able to add an overall warmth and humour to make it enjoyable. This is particularly through Amy Adams. She was delightful as a young career woman struggling to come to terms with her relationship with her father and figuring out what makes her happy in her life. She and Timberlake may not have the best romantic chemistry, but they do have great comedic chemistry, and I would trade for that any day.I'm still trying to figure out why Mickey was described as being smart when none of her actions indicate intelligence, but there is generally no requirement for smart characters, only likable ones, and she is likable. She had an effortless versus put-together sexiness mixed with her tomboy nature that made her very appealing. But one character does not make up for an ensemble relationship movie.",6,4,11,29 September 2012
Hugo," An orphan goes on an adventure, and we discover the magic of filmmaking
","'Hugo' has Martin Scorsese master the children's adventure movie genre. Scorsese's 2010 hit was 'Shutter Island' where he mastered the suspense thriller by paying attention to every detail in the film. Here, the camera is in the walls of a 1930s train station in Paris where we see the inner workings of clocks, an automaton, and an orphan boy looking for a key. It's also in 3D and is about the history of filmmaking.Visually, this is a masterpiece. Easily the best 3D movie released in recent memory, if not of all time. There is seamless merging between computer-generated graphics and real sets. Conceptually, this is very impressive. As Hugo is on one of his adventures, he starts finding connections to old films. These are not just fictional films that help the story along. Scorsese is actually telling us the history of filmmaking and uses the real footage of important films. He even rendered these real films in 3D. I don't know how he does it.Story wise, 'Hugo' suffered. It meandered a lot, never quite deciding which little adventure to start, or solve, or finish. A trick that I have learned in screen writing is to use a time frame to set the story in, a ticking clock as some might say. Ironically, for a film that had more actual ticking clocks than any other, they didn't give their story one.One has to question if this was really meant to be a children's movie. The over two-hour run time sent the younger kids crying into the arms of their mothers as exhaustion set in. And as the story moved away from an orphan boy on an adventure to the history of filmmaking, it became quite dry for the older kids. I found Hugo, our hero, to be a snotty kid who didn't even want to tell us what he was up to in the beginning, but at least the kids liked him. And I, at least, had the history of filmmaking to amuse me immensely.I don't think 'Hugo' was just supposed to be the history of filmmaking, but the magic of it. For those of us who love films, it certainly was magical. Hugo, the young boy, was removed from discovering the magic because his little adventure was mostly solved by the time we got into it. Unfortunately, I think this removes the kids in the audience from discovering the magic of it. But the kids can have fun watching a robot while the adults are educated — perhaps that is what makes 'Hugo' so special.Conveniently, both 'Hugo' and The Artist' are supposed to be the big winners of awards season this year, both were released the same month, and both have something to say about movies. After you watch 'Hugo' and are introduced to the earliest films of the Lumière brothers and Georges Méliès, watch 'The Artist' it picks up where 'Hugo' left off and introduces us to stars of silent films, the golden age of Hollywood.",7,6,9,4 December 2011
We're the Millers," The fake family brings many laughs, the other elements bring a few groans
","'We're the Millers' is a stoner comedy, except better than that because it's written as a family comedy - well, inappropriate family comedy. Oh, and it's actually funny. All of the main and supporting actors keep bringing the jokes so you can over-look the ridiculous plot. David (Jason Sudeikis) is still a pot dealer, even though he's 20 years past college. Two teens in need of parental figures screw up his simple drug-dealing lifestyle and now he has to smuggle a load of marijuana across the border. A fake family should be the perfect cover to fool the hapless border guards. He hires the two teens and his sexy neighbour, Rose (Jennifer Aniston), who is working as a stripper, even though she's more than 20 years past college. The comedy builds slowly, but then a fake baby (let's call her Mary Jane) enters the picture and the laughs come fast and furious. Some jokes weren't as funny as they thought (their new friends' sex acts), but by this time our fake family has connected with one another and the audience, and their obvious ending can drive us towards the conclusion of the ridiculous plot. Overall, 'We're the Millers' is pretty funny, and if you're watching a stoner comedy, you should be pretty forgiving of any nonsense the plot throws at you.",7,3,3,28 November 2013
The Men Who Stare at Goats," The force is strong with this one
","In 'The Men Who Stare at Goats', Ewan McGregor is our eyes and ears into a non-fiction but bizarre story. He is an everyman and without him we wouldn't be able to get into this incredulous tale.It's about Jedi Warriors, or psychic spies, who believe they have superpowers and use them to fight wars. This is the New Age Army, formed by Jeff Bridges as a hippie. Imagine the army run by a hippie. Yes, it is that good.George Clooney is the Jedi Warrior who tells the story to McGregor, who then relays it to us, mostly through flashbacks. They might spend a bit too long with Clooney and McGregor in present-day Iraq (well the Iraq desert at least), but that is part of the story.The humour is weird, dark, low-key, slow at times and very Coen Brothers-like. Not everyone shares this sense of humour. But for those that do, I recommend 'The Men Who Stare at Goats'. As McGregor says about Clooney, and I'm expanding it to the film, 'the force is strong with this one.'",8,9,13,13 July 2010
Dallas Buyers Club," A character with conflicting ideals provides a drama with charm and humour
","Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) has been diagnosed with AIDS in 1985. But surely that's a mistake because he 'ain't no homo'. 'Dallas Buyers Club' does a good job of establishing the character of Ron Woodroof with that of what he needs to do to survive. He lives in Dallas, lives a very disgusting lifestyle and should be close to dead. But he also likes making money and disregarding authority.McConaughey, as he is able to do, imbibes Mr. Woodroof with enough charm and likability that we care to follow him, but the faster we get past his less charming moments the better. The film hits its stride when we meet Rayon (Jared Leto), a transsexual also suffering from AIDS/HIV, and when we travel to Mexico to secure drugs otherwise unavailable in the United States.Dallas Buyers Club is a bordering-on-illegal club that Woodroof sets up to sell drugs to fellow sufferers. It serves a dual purpose of providing needed to care to a disenfranchised community of society and making Mr. Woodroof more money. He's this AIDs patient / cowboy / business man that really is pretty amusing. Along with the Texas accent and swagger, it's the type of mix that only McConaughey can pull off.Rayon and Woodroof have an interesting relationship in the beginning. The homophobic Woodroof can't stand the transsexual Rayon but Rayon can put him in touch with the homosexual community which has the money and need to buy life-saving drugs. Woodroof has to face the conundrum of money versus homophobia. He chooses money.That early comedy moves into drama as we learn more of Rayon's life, which is not a happy one. But Woodroof continues with this Texan swagger as he attempts to win over Eve (Jennifer Garner), a doctor in charge of the HIV drug trials and who prefers to do things according to protocol. Woodroof, of course, does not like doing things according to protocol.'Dallas Buyers Club' does mostly follow protocol but it was the many light and humorous moments of the movie that are most memorable.",8,2,3,4 February 2014
Now You See Me," The Four Horsemen create magical entertainment, the rest of the film attempts to undo it
","Sometimes I think I should give 'Now You See Me' more credit. It's exactly what it's supposed to be; the tag-line 'The closer you look, the less you see' couldn't be more accurate, and I'm pretty sure the sole point of Hollywood summer fare is to be entertaining. That it is. The Four Horsemen will take you on such a fun ride that you might not notice how terrible the script is.Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco work exceedingly well together as a rag-tag group of magicians. Their individual talents and personal egos are brought together to create magnificent illusions to entertain and please the common folk. They rob banks and rob people but it's okay because some banks are bad and some people are bad and they give the money back to people who unfairly lost it. They're Robin Hood and his Merry Men and FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is the Sheriff of Nottingham.The tricks were exciting to watch with a particularly appealing style and choreography. Story-wise, the tricks build in significance, visually the tricks build in cinematic wonder. People like that but eventually you'll get concerned that the film doesn't have anything intelligent to say.Dylan Rhodes was a frustrating character. He worked his way up in the FBI, takes his job seriously and snidely communicates with co-workers (whether they should be there or not). He doesn't care about magic – doesn't believe in it but also doesn't have an interest in how the tricks are actually accomplished. Each step closer to the Four Horsemen and he's pushed two steps back. The frustrating part is that we don't want him to catch them but we do want him to get close because whenever they're on the screen, the film is fun again.Obviously there's a twist, it wouldn't be a heist movie without one, but how unfortunate that is. I wasn't the only one hoping there wasn't a twist which was guaranteed to undo all the fun that came before it. It would have been a much better movie if the entire thing was Harrelson, Eisenberg, Fisher and Franco performing magic for the masses without even an attempt at a story. That would have been written better.As is, 'Now You See Me' throws in a romance subplot for no good reason, destroys meaningless characters for no good reason and a twist that undoes that glorious good the Four Horsemen accomplished. The Four Horsemen did accomplish a lot. Their personal issues never got in the way, the lack of character development wasn't a problem and they obeyed one of the golden rules of performance art: Have fun and your audience will too.",6,0,3,16 June 2013
No Strings Attached," No romance, comedy or even friendship - what kind of romantic comedy is that?
","'No Strings Attached', friends with benefits, and as they described it to their friends and family, they're friends who have sex. First there are the obvious jokes, 'Nope. That's not possible!' But my problem with that set-up is that these characters—if they are even characters—are definitely not friends. 'Acquaintances who have sex.' Really takes away some of the potential, doesn't it? We're already told that they're taking the romance out of a romantic comedy, but minus the amiability that comes with friendship, then they're also taking the comedy out of a romantic comedy. So what are we left with? A juvenile story, best friends who have a meaningless sub-plot, and sex. That's it. I like romantic comedies but they took out everything that I like about them and left me with everything that I don't like about them.It's vulgar as they promised but with no greater purpose and for no higher comedy. If you're going to give me sex humour, there has to be more to it. Not one-dimensional characters who have no resemblances to actual human beings. For as charming and attractive as Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman are, if there are no feelings attached, then why should I care? Paramount Pictures, this was just plain wrong.",3,12,17,14 May 2011
To Rome With Love," All of your heart's fantasies played out in Rome with love, celebrities, death and opera
","'To Rome with Love' is a fantasy film; a comedy about people living out their fantasies. The great thing about it is that it's subtle enough that you don't recognize the fantasy element in all of the relationships until later on in the film. The obvious one is when native Roman, Leopoldo Pisanello (Roberto Benigni), becomes a celebrity over night. 'It's better to be a celebrity than an unknown.' And as Benigni shows, way funnier too.It's the type of film where everybody gets to see themselves as famous, or supremely interesting, or a guiding angel, or married to a hooker, or the object of a movie star's affections, or on a romantic rendezvous with a thief, or having the ability to change the world with one simple idea. It will take you to wherever your heart desires. And then you'll realize why it's often advised to think with your brain rather than with your heart.Half Italian and half English, we follow two relationships involving Romans and two relationships with Americans in Rome. A young, Italian, married couple get separated and the young man finds himself living out every other young man's fantasies while the young woman finds herself living out her own fantasies.Hayley (Alison Pill), a New Yorker transplanted in Rome, falls in love and gets engaged to a successful Roman lawyer. Her parents (Woody Allen and Judy Davis) make the trek across the ocean to meet their in-laws. But Allen's obsession with death and equating retirement with death causes him to create a national disaster (or success story, depending on how you look at it).Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) is an American architect living in Rome with his girlfriend. First he meets his architecture idol, John (Alec Baldwin), who sees Jack as the younger version of himself. Or more accurately, Jack sees John as the older version of himself (the joke works better that way). Then Jack meets Monica (Ellen Page) who is his girlfriend's best friend and is the object of all men's fantasies.Page also gets to play the role of the self-obsessed, pseudo-intellectual — commonly referred to as 'the pedantic one' in most Woody Allen movies. Other than Allen himself, Eisenberg and Baldwin play a sort of tag-team version of the self-deprecating, neurotic hero, although this time with a touch of confidence.Confidence is not to be confused with optimism because as funny as 'To Rome with Love' is, it also has Allen's usual undertone of pessimism. Death is going to come sooner than you would like, but not soon enough. And even if you do get to live out your heart's fantasies, they may not lead to everything that you hoped for. This film is the comedy version of death and negativity, and can provide you with the simple joys in life.",9,80,115,17 July 2012
Bridesmaids," Apparently, women swearing really is funny to everybody
","A movie for women, about women, and by women. Well, make that last one written by women but directed and produced with the Paul Feig and Judd Apatow touch. This means that we get comedy and emotion in equal parts. But it also means that we get perverted humour, cliché cat-fights, and sweet romance.Some of the requisite inclusions like trying on bridesmaids dresses, which incorporates the perverted humour, are absolutely hilarious. While some of the requisite girl fights are stupid, ridiculous, and completely unrealistic. Realism may not be something they're aiming for here, but it's funnier when it's true.'Bridesmaids' is more about Annie (Kristen Wiig) than the other bridesmaids. A better title would have been 'Kristin Wiig Before the Wedding'. Wiig is best known for 'Saturday Night Live', and they do take a lot traits from SNL, live over-using Wiig, having scenes last longer than they should, but at least the majority of them are funny. Thankfully the other featured bridesmaid is played by Melissa McCarthy. She is given the best character, the funniest lines, and proves how good of a comedic actress she is.Undeniably, 'Bridesmaids' is hilarious, but the ridiculously high critics' rating really just suggests that men love it when women swear. It's funny but it's not brilliant.",7,4,10,22 May 2011
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A beautiful, funny story that is just as smart as it is nonsensical
","Wes Anderson's latest film 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' opens at the elaborate Grand Budapest Hotel with a storied history located in the fictional former empire Zubrowka in Eastern Europe. Young Zero Moustafa (newcomer Tony Revolori) is an aspiring lobby boy for the famed concierge Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes). The elder takes Zero under his wing and the two begin a trek across mythical lands.As with recent Anderson films, this shares his distinctive artistic sense. Like he's telling a story through pictures. The story here is a quirky, idiosyncratic tale of mischievous and silly whimsicality. Random nonsense could also be a way to describe it. The plot, or a loose semblance of chapters of a related story, literally takes Mr. Gustave and Zero from satisfying old ladies, to art thieves, through a murder plot, to prison, a brief pause to fall in love, to escaped convicts and back to the noted Grand Budapest Hotel. It was quick and playful, also very far removed from any relatable sense of reality.But the interesting thing about the film is that it does serve as an odd viewpoint to the real, war-torn world of late 1930s Europe. Personally, I found the juxtaposition between the frivolousness of the story and the dark, grandiose themes of life to be too startling and moves the film even closer to random nonsense. However, this is also where the film shows off its unique, incredibly intelligent and endlessly witty dialogue. It is really funny and fits both the quirky, playful nature of the story and the darker tones of the times. The dialogue at least allows you to laugh your way through the film even if you don't form much interest in the story.As mentioned before, Wes Anderson is telling a story through pictures. Each shot is framed meticulously and symmetrically. I like his 'square' way of telling more ludicrous stories. There are also a number of shot set-ups which allow for some funny jokes as the camera pans over to complete the scene. The production design is also very beautiful and fits the grand and eloquent, but also lonely, hotel. The colour palette this time around shifts more than usual, but the story also goes through a lot of phases. The hotel itself is bathed in a dull pink and purple, which is a gorgeous visual imagery for the overcast pall of communism and the lavish and hopeful lifestyles of its residents and employees.'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is based on the writings of Stefan Zweig and it opens with a writer telling a story of an older Zero relaying the story of his life. Part of my issues with the film is that these characters don't resemble humans. Zero's motivations aren't clear and are not understandable, and Mr. Gustave is just crazy. And then they embark on an adventure that is just as odd as they are. The dialogue is hilarious and astute, and the landscape it all unfolds on is beautiful and elegantly created. It's a beloved film, but some will be unable to place themselves in that world.",7,1,3,9 July 2014
Revolutionary Road," Revolutionary characters on a road that curved to brilliance
","As Frank and April Wheeler move to Revolutionary Road, it is indeed hard to remember if they are the young Wheelers on Revolutionary Road, or the young Revolutionaries on Wheeler Road. This was noted by mental institution patient, John (Michael Shannon) and I agreed with him. Part of the brilliance of 'Revolutionary Road' is having the one character who is deemed mentally unfit also be the one voice of reason.Director Sam Mendes takes us back to the 1950s to a Connecticut Suburb, where you were supposed to get married, have kids and play house. And if you wanted to play in a pretty house with a pretty wife and kids, then you had to work at a job you didn't like. Frank and April are more perceptive and innovative than those around them, and they believed that they didn't have to live that life to be happy. They could move to Paris and do whatever they wanted.Revolutionary Road was not a straight road, and although it never really twisted or turned, it did curve. Frank and April could see past their neighbours, but they couldn't see past themselves. Instead of a revolutionary move across the ocean, we got to examine trust issues that only spanned the suburb and the city. And for as forward-looking as they are, they couldn't see what was holding them back. But we could.I was fascinated by 'Revolutionary Road' because they gave me a revolutionary character that I could instantly connect with, and the resolutions for Frank and April were always just around the bend that you could almost see. DiCaprio, Winslet, Mendes and writer Justin Haythe have enough talent and nerve to drive me straight to the end without stalling.",9,0,1,28 January 2011
Mr. Nobody," 'Mr. Nobody' is about nothing but encompasses everything
","At the beginning of 'Mr. Nobody' we meet Nemo Nobody in the future as an 118-year-old man and twice in the present as his 34-year-old self, but he doesn't know, and we don't know, which life is his. The rest of the film isn't so much about figuring out which life is actually real, but that all lives of right if you choose right.It's about life, death, birth, and everything before, after and in-between. For as weird as it sounds, it is just as weird, but it's also a beautifully realized film with elegant shots, outstanding performances, and thought-provoking dialogue. 'Mr. Nobody' embodies questions of fate, lectures on physics, and space travel to Mars—there's a good reason the film is two and a half hours long. And what film wouldn't be complete without multiple loves and three wives?'Mr. Nobody' is a remarkable film because it pretty much accomplishes all of the aforementioned concepts. It's also a really long exercise in existential philosophy with a complete time-line of one man's life in multiple dimensions. The old Mr. Nobody makes statements saying that he's a nobody but his life has been everything, and, well, this film is nothing but also everything at the same time.",7,3,6,18 January 2011
Drive," Driving a slow and thoughtful character study into a full-on violent crime thriller
","Ryan Gosling is a driver. During the day, he's a part-time Hollywood stunt man and a part-time car mechanic. During the night, he seems to spend most of his time helping out with criminal activities. All of the time, he's a leading man. He has a quiet and unassuming charm about him that can drive girls wild, and grateful bosses (like Bryan Cranston) since he's so trustworthy and capable.The girl is Carey Mulligan, looking much older and more experienced than her 16 year-old Jenny from 'An Education' (2009). Again, sometimes girls fall for the wrong guy. But sometimes, the guy isn't bad, he just makes some wrong turns. For the few questionable choices that the driver made, every choice the filmmakers made was perfect. The film has such an artistic appeal to it with interesting transitions and scenes where the characters might just sit silent for five minutes, but we still know what's going on.The driver may drive at high-speeds and flip cars in Hollywood crash 'em up action movies, but 'Drive' is anything but. It's actually not so far-fetched for Gosling to refer to it as a 'John Hughes superhero movie.' There's a background feel to it that makes it seem like an '80s chick flick, even though it's nothing like that. It starts with the speed of a minimalistic character study, but we don't even learn our hero's name. I'm glad it started that way because it got me more interested in the crime and money-stealing plot.'Drive' is slow, thoughtful, and interestingly shot and paced. Oh, and it's violent. Things get bloody as there is a tendency for heads to get smashed in when the money and livelihood of thugs are in jeopardy. Be sure you know your driver and your route home well after seeing this as you could be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life.",8,6,17,16 September 2011
Kick-Ass," Characters who are just so entertaining they 'Kick-Ass'
","Why don't people just put on capes and try to be superheroes? Because they would likely get themselves killed on their first night out. We meet Dave (Aaron Johnson) in high school when reading too many comic books has given him the idea that he should become a superhero. He becomes 'Kick-Ass'.The character of Dave gives this movie the most brilliantly funny start to any movie even close to the comic book, or action, or even comedy genre. Writing that smart and that funny is not expected in a movie like this. And by 'this', I mean a movie where bad guys have guns, and more bad guys have more guns, and then trained assassins have even more guns.The 'trained assassins' part is where Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) come in. Most people like Cage in his annual action role, but this is better, his comedic delivery is a sort of self-mockery and it's perfect. Hit-Girl and young actress Moretz are what sets this film apart and will determine whether or not you'll like it. Hit-Girl kills people. That's all she knows how to do. Some reviewers, like Roger Ebert, don't think it's funny when 11 year-old girls kill people (a lot of people). I happen to agree with him, but this movie has a lot of fans that don't agree. Moretz is like a cute, young, female Jackie Chan. For fanboys who like martial arts movies that is like hitting the jackpot.I don't like comic books, I don't like comic book movies, and I really don't like martial arts movies. I can like action movies if they give me solid characters to believe in. That's what 'Kick-Ass' did and I liked it. Hit-Girl sent my head spinning but that's not necessarily a bad thing.",7,0,4,23 May 2011
Gran Torino," 'Gran Torino' has too many problems that makes it not as good as it's supposed to be
","Clint Eastwood's 'Gran Torino' is like a bad film disguised as a good film. The truth lies somewhere in between. There are a couple of lines that belong in 'Dirty Harry', like: 'Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have messed with? That's me'. All delivered in his dry-throat, raspy voice.The Vietnamese neighbours were all beautifully crafted and very well portrayed. Eastwood's occasional racist behaviour and then occasional friendly behaviour towards them was confusing, but it was paced well enough that it kept me watching.There are some problems in the writing. Apart from the 'Dirty Harry'-lines, there were mistakes in the characterizations, characters actions that were out of place. I never could figure out if Walt truly loved his late wife or didn't give a damn about her. Sure, he loved his 1972 Gran Torino car, but it barely even became its own character in the film. Too many problems with 'Gran Torino' means it's not as good as it is supposed to be.",5,2,5,22 November 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Not worthy of the rights to Fitzgerald's short story
","This film has the audacity to claim that it is based on the short story 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' by the incomparable F. Scott Fitzgerald (published in 1922) who credits Mark Twain and Samuel Butler for the philosophical idea that 'it's a pity that the best part of life came at the beginning and the worst part at the end'.This film version of 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' did not retain any of the cogitative ideas presented in the book when a man ages backwards. So when watching, there is no deep thought-provoking concepts explored, and nothing to engage you in a philosophical exploration of life. I'm guessing that the only thing of value is supposed to be that part of the film has Brad Pitt looking not attractive. That is as far as Hollywood can take a good book.Clearly the film does have high production values and they may have done a lot of good things, but they lost their right to be judged fairly as a film once they bought the rights to Fitzgerald's story. Now nobody will even have a chance to see this great story brought to visual life, and that is a travesty.Please go to your local public library and borrow a copy of 'Tales of the Jazz Age', you will be able to read the short story and get so much more out of it than the film and in less time and money.",1,11,20,19 July 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," Intelligence mixed with big-budget Hollywood action to form the new science fiction romance genre
","I'm starting to like this new genre of science fiction romance that 'The Adjustment Bureau' falls into. Hollywood seems to have learned how to add a significant amount thought to their films, just with their usual dumbing-down procedures.David (Matt Damon) has met Elise (Emily Blunt) and based on one spontaneous kiss and one flirtatious encounter, he's determined that she's the one he's supposed to be with. They have other plans. Oh yes, the indefinable, ambiguous pronoun 'they'. Just to keep a sense of the intrigue afloat, I'll define 'they' as the men of 'The Adjustment Bureau'. What they want, we don't really know. But David wants the girl—a beautiful girl—but just a girl nonetheless.For us, questions of free will, fate, soul mates, success and pre-defined destinies abound. All running around an intricate maze of New York architecture. Although intricate might not be the best word because there's nothing here for us to figure out; the film lays everything out well in advance, and over and over again in case you missed it. At least there's intelligence to the story but unfortunately no subtlety.'The Adjustment Bureau' has pretty city-scapes and pretty people playing more profound characters than pretty people usually play. As with most genre-mixing films, there is something for everybody. I got the intelligence that is usually sorely missing from big-budget Hollywood action films although I could have done with a bit more respect.",7,116,172,6 March 2011
The Hangover Part II," An extreme comedy that focuses more on shock than on creativity
","This time around they are in Thailand. Like last time, they have forgotten their night out, and as Phil confesses on a cell phone call to Tracy, things are bad this time. The good news is, Doug is okay, bad news is brother-in-law Teddy is missing and their answers may have gone crashing into a glass table.Bangkok is dirtier than Las Vegas, at least in this film it is. Everything is significantly grittier, darker, and ruder. At times Zach Galifianakis' character was less like the Alan we met first time around and more like Ethan from 'Due Date'. He was still very funny as are the other guys, but there was just an air of disrespect and insolence to the whole thing.Their references to the original 'The Hangover' were quite funny, and although I probably would have rather watched it, this was another original take with the same characters and formula that I fell in love with. I laughed not as often as I did the first time around, but I still laughed just as much as I was expecting too.The problem when Hollywood gets their hands on a good idea, is that they need to make everything bigger and bolder. The jokes are more outrageous, less witty, their adventures are more shocking, less creative, and instead of intelligent, snappy dialogue we get chase scenes and explosions. Of course we do. They got to spend more than twice as much money.Although 'The Hangover Part II' is an inferior product to the brilliantly funny original, there are laughs and everything is more extreme as they promised.",6,13,29,25 May 2011
Prisoners," Two suspenseful approaches to one dark crime
","It's Thanksgiving in Pennsylvania and the sky is grey, the air is cold and the ground is frozen. Two families, perfectly matched, celebrate the holiday together. Each family has two kids, a teenager and a younger daughter. The daughters are 6-year-old girls, ready to get into a harmless adventure, and the teenagers are teenagers. But the girls go missing, and the hunt goes on to find them and figure out what happened.The families have no luck and soon enough the police are there to help. The lead investigator is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), and the one father, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), already has his suspicions that he's not going to be useful at all. I think now is as good as time as any to declare that Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki is one of the most fascinating detectives to watch, and arguably one of the best performances of a detective ever. I want him on every case.Keller disagrees because he already has his prime suspect and any decent detective would torture him until he revealed the location of the missing girls. Unfortunately the prime suspect, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), is mentally disabled and likely incapable of committing such a serious crime.'Prisoners' is a good movie because it takes two different approaches to try to get to the same result. Keller takes matters into his own hands to track down the killer and the missing girls. And Detective Loki actively tries to solve the case. Loki is really on his own with Keller against his every move and boss which won't budge on formalities. Keller, on the other hand, shouldn't be alone with a wife who needs his support, a teenage son left to deal with a tragedy on his own, and a similarly suffering best friend. He turns from all of them but the latter to take care of the case on his own.The farther that our two active participants get in opposite directions, the more that needs to be solved. And 'Prisoners' spends two and a half hours leading us down a twisting, suspenseful path during a bleak November in a Pennsylvanian suburb.",8,1,2,27 January 2014
Friends with Benefits," Insulting romantic comedies, its fans, and everything else
","The thing about 'Friends with Benefits' is that you have, in fact, seen it before. Not in the generic way the film implies that all romantic comedies are the same. But this exact movie was released earlier this year with the title 'No Strings Attached'. And what's worse is that vapid, uninspired, Hollywood-love-fest original is actually better.Unashamedly, I admit that I like romantic comedies. I do get very upset when Hollywood makes stupid ones that I don't like it, but I still watch them. The problems here stem from the fact that 'Friends with Benefits' is a romantic comedy but thinks that it isn't. One of the jokes that lasts the entire run-time of the movie is that romantic comedies suck and the people who watch them are fundamentally stupid. I don't like being insulted and I especially don't like being insulted by something that is trying to survive on put-downs and pretending to be better than the very genre they belong to.There is a fake romantic comedy that plays during this movie, usually serving as fodder for insults, and allows the film to point out everything that is wrong with it. I don't think the filmmakers are so daft to not realize that they are doing the exact same things, but I do think they expected their audience to not pick up on it.Recently Jason Segel has been doing the rounds promoting his new Muppets movie. One of the points he likes making is that the humour is pure and innocent; that the jokes don't insult or put-down anyone or anything. I like Segel as much as the next person, but it astounds me that he could be so hypocritical that just three months earlier he appeared in a movie where every joke insulted somebody or something.And I do mean every joke. We start with John Mayer insults and the obligatory Katherine Heigl jokes, move on to standard romantic comedy insults, then come back with some out-of-place jokes making fun of the Hudson River-landing pilot, and on the way back to more romantic comedy insults, shoot off some remarks about Kriss Kross, '90s pop bands, and of course, homosexuals. And I likely forgot some.Contrary to the current popular stance, I like Justin Timberlake. He has been in a lot of movies recently, and he's usually one of the best things in them. He also has no problem insulting himself. Surprisingly, the movie never took that path.If for some reason, you're still watching, beware that 'Friends with Benefits' probably has the highest product placement total in recent history. There's a reason Timberlake's character is a marketing exec at GQ – if they didn't make enough money at the box office, they would have off of their sponsors.To be clear, 'Friends with Benefits' is a romantic comedy. Girl is emotionally damaged, boy is emotionally unavailable. Girl falls for boy, boy falls for girl, but let's see how long before they both give in. If you don't like romantic comedies, then you won't like this. If you do like romantic comedies, then the filmmakers think you have a worthless opinion and you won't like it anyways. It is odd how that works out.",2,16,35,31 October 2011
The Artist," The golden hue of black and white silence and old-school charm
","'The Artist' is an artist's film; a tribute to the golden age of movies. In 1927, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a silent film star at the height of success. When the studios turn their attention to talkies, George isn't ready to make the transition. He continues to watch the world in black & white and listen in silence.If you haven't realized it yet, 'The Artist' is a silent, black and white film, and it's great. Our hero, George Valentin, was created in the vain of the swashbuckling Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. He is funny, charming, charismatic; he can do comedies, dramas, action-adventures; he has a wife, adoring fans, and a dog. The dog is star number 2, capable of playing dead or dancing in step with George.An adoring fan finds herself absorbing the spotlight after a chance meeting with George. Not only can she keep up with him, but the world is ready to hear the voice of Ms. Peppy Miller. She is not named 'Peppy' by accident.We have a delightful story of love; love of success, love of movies, and love between George and Peppy. Dujardin has a wonderful comedic touch to everything he does in this movie that the simple story line is helped along with a healthy dose of comedy. He turns serious when The Great Depression hits, but 'The Artist' keeps chugging along with its original, uplifting score, inventive scenes, and a finale that brings us into the future.",9,3,7,2 December 2011
Super 8," Like it for its nostalgia, cuteness, or possible aliens
","Building a film out of nostalgia is exactly what 'Super 8' is. Nostalgia for the Steven Spielberg films from the '80s, jokes about the '70s, and the pure joy that Spielberg and Abrams would have had for filmmaking as young boys. A movie about movie making. It might also be about aliens.We start by getting to know our six young protagonists and the love they have for making a movie. As Charles always says, 'Production value is key.' In the real world, I can't imagine production value is a concern anymore for Abrams. The budget for this movie is $50 million and it shows with trains crashing, over and over again, and cars flying through the air, over and over again. From there we go to the main Hollywood story which involves a teenage love story, strange occurrences in the town with dogs missing, and a mysterious Government cover-up. Hint: It might involve aliens.I liked 'Super 8' because I like nostalgia. The jokes about the '70s were quite funny (I could be wrong, it might not be aliens, but the Russians!). Kids making a low-budget zombie movie is funny, especially when all six of them can actually act. If you ignore the whole Government conspiracy angle, then everything was quite cute, even the possible aliens.",7,0,0,25 June 2011
Rio," Birds singing and dancing their way to Brazil, and that's all
","I thought it was just for fun that 'Rio' rhymed with 'Nemo' and that the story of 'Rio' (2011) nearly mirrors the story of 'Finding Nemo' (2003). But there is actual fact in this movie. Hyacinth Macaws (blue in colour) are real birds who are endangered and native to Rio de Janeiro. The cage bird trade — which takes our beloved Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) to Minnesota — are a problem for the species. I'm pretty sure they don't talk though.I mean form thoughts, speak in complete sentences and solve math and engineering problems. Blu can do all of that but he can't fly. When he returns to Brazil, that is the entire joke and conflict of the movie all wrapped up into one. Which makes the movie very, very short.To round it out, all the birds, animals, and even humans have to stop and sing and dance for awhile. They have to because it is done in every animated animal movie where the hero returns home (either the artificial or natural home). It's annoying here because the birds do a sort of hip-hop, rap, dance routine — the kind that is in 'popular' movies. Blu's female counterpart Jewel is voiced by Anne Hathaway, who can actually sing, but she doesn't until the very end in a duet with Jesse Eisenberg who cannot sing.I liked the animation, especially of the Hyacinth Macaws (and I completely accept that they changed the female's colouring since we do need to be able to tell them apart). The animated 'choreography' with the multi-coloured birds dancing was cute enough it was almost dazzling.The reason we animate animals is because it is supposed to be cute and funny, but 'Rio' unfortunately, really was not funny. Perhaps it will be to kids, but for those of us who find flaws in animated children's movies, it's just not quite cute and funny enough.",6,0,1,11 August 2011
Limitless," A limitless source of stupidity
","Ever thought about what you could do if a magical pill could turn your life into its most promising form? Hollywood execs have and 'Limitless' just shows that they wish they could be smart. And it is just a magical pill because any scientific explanation is lacking, at best.We first meet Eddie (Bradley Cooper) on the ledge of a building as bad guys are breaking down his door. He's not going to let them win—apparently, suicide is him 'winning'. But then we rewind back to the beginning of the story. Eddie is an unemployed writer, losing his girlfriend, and losing his grip on reality. When a mysterious pill comes his way, perhaps drugs could secure his grip on reality? One of the many problems, is that Bradley Cooper can never be a worthless slob with no job. With looks like that and eyes that blue, countless romantic comedies have proved that he can easily get women like Julia Roberts, Scarlett Johansson and Jennifer Connelly.Attempting to find clever ways to show off New York (and handsome men vomiting), just sent the camera on a whirlwind spin, and my head on a worse one. Car chases, fist fights and elaborate action sequences were thrown in just to distract you from the point that they had nowhere else to take the story.'Limitless' has proved that Hollywood's stupidity is... (yes, I am going there)... limitless.",1,34,71,19 March 2011
In Time," Time is money and the science fiction romance genre is money for Hollywood
","In the world of 'In Time', time is money. Literally. Set in a future where everybody ages until 25, then they have one year left to live, except that one year is currency. The rich can live at age 25 eternally and the poor don't always have a chance to live. Time zones are classes of wealth and you can't cross over without upsetting the order of the world. It's quite possible that they have taken this time is money equation too far.But I enjoyed this twist on the same old action movie. It even starts with some thoughts on philosophy. A rich boy finds himself in a poor man's bar where everybody wants a piece of him, so much so that his considerable wealth and time line are in danger. While the poor are in constant need of money, it turns out that the rich don't have the same drives for life. This rich guy is impressed by Will's (Justin Timberlake) honesty and earnest desire to find out how the other side lives. Will is then faced with the possibility of an infinite life time of money.From there, we get a Robin Hood action movie. Will pairs up with a daddy's girl vixen, Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) and they are on the run from the time keepers (Cillian Murphy). I have enjoyed Timberlake's recent foray into the world of movie stars, but I like him more as a comedic straight man than as an action hero. Seyfried, on the other hand, proves that she can play pretty much anything. A mysteriously innocent, sharp-shooting, sexy action girl suits her well.The logic that this new world presents is pretty easy to figure out, but as you are doing that at least you are distracted from the usual action movie set-up. Hollywood has ventured again into the science fiction romance genre, and has again come out with an intelligent, action-packed film with something for everyone.",7,14,18,13 November 2011
Burlesque," Lofty, dramatic and musically ambitious, but also obvious, lame, and mildly entertaining
","Like the name implies, 'Burlesque' was lofty, dramatic and musically ambitious. Unlike the name, I think it was too serious to be much of a parody of stage-shows. Cher is an actress, an Academy Award winning actress at that, but there was minimal evidence of intentional self-caricaturing.A small-town Iowa waitress pursues her dreams and high-tails it to Los Angeles. Ali has way too much audacity for her own good but it does get her a job, two scrumptious boyfriends, and into the burlesque show. Of course it does. Alice, you are in wonderland now. At least when lines like that are delivered by Stanley Tucci they are pretty funny.The film did have a plot with questions along the lines of: Will Ali realize her dreams of singing and dancing? Will she meet the man of her dreams? And more importantly, will Tess (Cher) save her club from financial ruin? The latter storyline might actually matter if the rest of the film wasn't littered with outlandish sets, costumes and lighting. But 'Burlesque' is also what it claims to be—entertaining. Well, mildly entertaining. Christina Aguilera can sing, Cher and Stanley Tucci have good comedic chemistry, and Cam Gigandet is one of the hottest young actors around.",4,28,52,10 March 2011
Dark Shadows," A beautiful but boring production of vampires and witches and love and other nonsense
","I'm assuming it's the recent obsession with vampires, including teenage vampire love and nonsensical vampire lore, that has made it okay to make movies based on bad 1960s horror-drama soap operas. I had also assumed that Tim Burton's remake of 'Dark Shadows' would be a comedy. In that case, at least, I was wrong. Unfortunately, the film stayed faithful to the original and was more soap opera-like than comedic.Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is from the 1770s but had a curse placed on him (because of unrequited love) and is pulled from his coffin as a vampire in 1972. There are a few quick jokes making fun of the 1970s and the changing of the times, and then sprinkled throughout there are a handful of funny one-liners as Barnabas comes to terms with the new-age world. I would have actually preferred the movie if that was the entire thing. But instead it was mostly about rich families trying to maintain their wealth and control their fortune and status in a small community. It's also about vampires and witches falling in love and determining their destiny.These characters really don't do anything interesting so I certainly don't care about their future, whether it's a lack of a future or an eternal future. Again, as a comedy, it could have at least been entertaining. Being a Tim Burton film though, he obviously cares more about the visuals than the characters or the story. It was a fairly detailed atmosphere, combining mystery-like illustrated art work with 1970s lavish musical sets.The costuming was pretty exquisite. Over-the-top in some cases, but I'm assuming that was the point. The best part was the stylistic flair to Eva Green's witch named Angelique. The clothes and make-up alone defined that character. And that was counteracted with this ethereal beauty of Bella Heathcote and her innocent and unadorned love. I have singled those two actresses out because they were the only two that tried to make this movie interesting on some level.Since costumes don't comprise an entire movie, the rest was the soundtrack. Littered with catchy pop tunes, we were supposed to be singing along to songs that defined a generation. Obviously that last bit is an exaggeration, but the influence on the movie is not. There was even an entire Alice Cooper concert thrown in just for the fun of it. 'Dark Shadows' was made just for the fun of it all, but why wasn't it more funny?",4,30,62,10 May 2012
Inception," Merges style with substance
","'Inception' is what you get when a filmmaker knows how to merge style with substance. Christopher Nolan has crafted a story (not an original one, but that's OK) that takes slightly abstract ideas and places it in a reality you can almost grasp, and then tells it with little complexity. It's a movie for all the masses - and that's where Nolan's genius comes in.He gives us characters, many of them in fact, and all performed expertly by the stellar cast. The dreams all have their own architecture which is visually stunning. And no it's not redundant to say again that he managed to merge style with substance.'Inception' is filled with special effects, action running all over the place and loud dramatic scores. Remember this is Nolan with a big budget. But it's also just a straight-forward story with characters and romance - it does star Leonardo DiCaprio after all.",8,4,8,17 July 2010
Despicable Me," I highly recommend 'Despicable Me' for its 'pure' comedy
","'Despicable Me' really is an animated family comedy. With such a simple, but clever, storyline of villain vs. villain, it is just a kids movie despite the many stars for attraction of an older audience.It is full of funny lines, which are not unsuitable or over kids' heads. Adults will be able to appropriately laugh throughout the film along with all the other kids. So many recent animated family comedies have claimed its funny for the adults and kids, but they have different jokes for them. Jokes that are inappropriate for kids that they don't understand and they sit there confused as their parents laugh at mature humour. The great thing about 'Despicable Me' is that it's one of the first where it's so well written that it's the same jokes that the adults and kids will be laughing at. These jokes are sweet, simple and genuinely funny.Steve Carell is great as Gru, the struggling villain, who comes up with ludicrous plans to become a super villain. I was particularly impressed with Jason Segel as Vector, the super villain (who commits crimes with direction and magnitude). The original songs written for this movie are also catchy and humorous.I highly recommend 'Despicable Me' for its 'pure' comedy.",7,2,5,29 October 2010
The Woman in Black," Simple, quiet but creepy harshness to a classic horror
","I went into 'The Woman in Black' thinking it was going to be a dramatic thriller along the lines of 'Martha Marcy May Marlene' or 'Take Shelter'. But it turns out to be a classic horror. Better than a Hollywood horror movie, at least it's a British indie. Set in the late 1800s in a haunted house, the film thrives on the austere harshness of the small town, the house and its inhabitants.We have one main hero, Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe), who has to leave his young son and travel on business to take care of the final papers of a deceased woman and her lonely old house. The house is literally haunted with shadows of disquieted ghosts and creepy deaths of young children. The overblown score will tell you when to get scared. Some of which were reasonable startles to have in a movie, but towards the end most thrills were visibly ridiculous.The only interesting direction the film takes is never having Arthur doubt himself. He knows what he is seeing and he's going to get to the bottom of it. The reason that character works so well is Daniel Radcliffe. He's good for the film, and the film is great for him. He has a very quiet demeanour and a very earnest, steadfast approach. This keeps the film simple and gives a power to the actors. One which Radcliffe competently displays.Everything and everyone in the film is haunted. The title tells us, and prepares us for, one of the illusions, which I thought was good. Most of the other-worldly hallucinations or actions were just to increase the creepiness factor but don't give any insightful interpretations. But then again, I don't particularly like horror movies; only when there is an element of reality to the thrill.",6,0,1,12 March 2012
Win Win," Great characters looking for something in life and 'Win Win' just might be that something
","As in Thomas McCarthy's first film, 'The Station Agent', there is an  air of loneliness to the characters in 'Win Win' but also with an  ability to be kind and with a whole lot of humour permeating  throughout. Mike (Paul Giamatti) is approaching a mid-life crisis; the  monotony of daily life and money troubles colliding. But this is a well  written film and it doesn't look or feel like a mid-life crisis.  Just as we get to know the characters exceedingly well (despite the  short air time for some - Bobby Cannavale's Terry), a plot is  introduced. Mike starts acting like a sleazy lawyer just to make some  easy money, even though he's anything but a sleazy lawyer. Because he's  a good guy, realities quickly catch up, and he starts taking  responsibility for a troubled kid. Mostly trying to assuage his guilt  of wrong-doing, but this kid happens to be a wrestling phenom and Mike  is a struggling high school wrestling coach. This film could easily  turn into an underdog sports story, but as I said before, this is a  well written film and it doesn't look or feel like an underdog sports  story.  I found 'Win Win' to be a great mix of character study, a mid-life  crisis, and an underdog sports story all rolled into something that  isn't any of the above. It's a light, funny, enjoyable slice of life  that could provide a few lessons on morality but stops itself before it  becomes condescending.",8,34,44,24 April 2011
Moonrise Kingdom," Young, yellow love finding happiness in the world of Wes Anderson
","Like all Wes Anderson films, 'Moonrise Kingdom' has its own specific colour palette. This time it's yellow. Yellow can symbolize wisdom, joy and happiness but also the conflicting traits of cowardice, loneliness and deceit. All of which can be found in the characters that inhabit this world. 'Moonrise Kingdom' takes place in the 1960s on a remote island of New England, but I'm pretty sure it's set in a time and place that doesn't exist and never has.The opening, establishing shots were quick and strange making sure that you had no idea what you were getting yourself into. Beautiful American homes standing alone on rocky cliffs and a handful of characters looking alone and out of place. But of course during this time I was focusing on the opening credits and discovered a delightful mix of actors.Edward Norton (whom we welcome back to the quirky comedy genre) plays the Scout Master Ward of a small group of boy Khaki Scouts, dressed of course in khaki. The movie starts when he discovers that one such boy has zipped his tent up from the inside and escaped through a hole covered up by a map. Sam, we discover, was a troubled kid, disliked by everybody. When his foster father is informed of the incident, he informs us that Sam is not welcome back home, at this time.Norton instructs the Khaki Scouts to find Sam and bring him back. But these boys are armed and dangerous. Carrying guns, knives, clubs and axes, they don't like Sam. Norton also calls the local police captain, Bruce Willis (whom we enthusiastically welcome to quirky comedy genre). At around this time, Bill Murray (of course) and Frances McDormand discover that their daughter Suzy is also missing. Suzy discovered a pamphlet on 'Coping with the very troubled child' that her parents put on top of the refrigerator, and she has run away.This is when this clever, comedic and quirky film really came into its own for me. We have a pair of smart, troubled, independent and lonely preadolescents on the run together. And the genre that 'Moonrise Kingdom' belongs to finally became clear: it's a simple, coming-of-age comedy about puppy love. As unnatural as everything seems at times, all the while being set in nature, Anderson's depiction of preadolescent love was the most realistic interpretation I have ever seen.Sam and Suzy are played by Kara Haywood and Jared Gilman (reverse respectively) making their feature film and Wes Anderson film debuts. And they couldn't have been better, fitting right into the eccentric landscape. An almost unstoppable duo, Sam and Suzy send the local inhabitants on even more search parties and disastrous adventures determined to find a place where they and everyone around them can find happiness. 'Moonrise Kingdom' is that place with remarkable stylistic imagery.",8,3,5,2 July 2012
Pitch Perfect," Romance to cheer for, low-grade comedy, but musical numbers both predictable and perfect
","'Pitch Perfect' is kind of like taking 'Glee' and putting it into a college environment, but is more like mixing the popularity of 'Bridesmaids'-styled humour and the popularity of a cappella singing. The Barden Bellas are a struggling all-girl singing group trying to succeed with female pop songs from yester-year and showing off their bikini bodies, but after an on-stage meltdown, the team is left with two high-strung seniors and is forced to rebuild.Beca (Anna Kendrick) is an aspiring DJ with no interest in campus life, but after a deal made with her father (a small but good role by John Benjamin Hickey), Beca considers joining the Bellas. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), who calls herself Fat Amy so twig bitches like the Bella leaders don't call her that behind her back, is not what Aubrey (Anna Camp) and Chloe (Brittany Snow) have in mind to rebuild the group, but she can match pitch perfectly.What makes 'Pitch Perfect' a good movie is the supporting characters. Fat Amy is a fully-realized character where everything she does and everything she says matches what we have come to know about her. Stacie (Alexis Knapp) and Cynthia Rose (Ester Dean) have even less screen time, but are almost just as complete of characters. Amy, in particular, is hilarious and provides all of the humour in the movie.The lead characters aren't nearly as well thought-out. Aubrey is a screeching, high-maintenance control freak, one-dimensionally so, and her few moments of humour are very low quality and very poorly realized (her aforementioned on-stage meltdown is almost laughably bad it's so poorly edited). Chloe, unfortunately, has a very simplistic role as Aubrey's only sidekick who also shares Beca's vision. Snow is a better actress than that.As the Bellas are trying to find their groove as the competition regionals and finals approach, Beca has met a boy who belongs to their all-male rivals. Jesse (Skylar Astin) is cute and extremely likable (an actually very impressive feat considering he got in over his quirky but cute roommate). Jesse aspires to create movie scores (yet another excellent character trait), and through his friendship with Beca, hopes to introduce her to some of the classics. All movies, as Beca complains, are predictable. You know that the boy is going to get the girl and you know what is going to happen before it happens. Jesse says that doesn't matter because the perfect music can still move you to tears. His prime example is 'The Breakfast Club'.Of course 'Pitch Perfect' was predictable, and while that might drag during some of their early competition performances, the predictability works for the type of movie it is. Sometimes the comedic dialogue went too far for a joke, other times the humour was just a cheap gag, but overall it was still funny. With better, more original comedy it could have been a very good movie. Beca and Jesse made a great on-screen couple and had the audience cheering them on. In fact, 'Pitch Perfect' works very well as a romantic comedy with a non-romantic primary storyline.",8,3,8,30 September 2012
50_50," The mostly weird, but the funny and the beautiful of the comedy of cancer
","'50/50' takes the dying-of-cancer genre and mixes it with the crass-and-crude comedy genre. The result is a film which is half-touching and half-funny, and only barely adds up to a whole. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has made a career out of playing the nice guy with the simple and subtle reactions, usually in light comedies, but as 27 year-old Adam there was a bit too much of the nice and light.Seth Rogen has made a career out of playing the bumbling best friend with rude lines and sexual innuendos. As usual, he was still pretty funny here. But it is a weird mix when one friend is dying of cancer and the other is making jokes about getting laid in high school. It is also exactly what the film was trying to do.Adam is trying to come to an understanding and acceptance of the finality of his life, and it is his life. He wants everybody to understand that. Whether it's the unhelpful assistance of his passive aggressive girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard), or the awkward joke-making of his best friend, or the incessant meddling of his mother, Adam just wants to be left alone. Not actually alone, alone, but alone with them.There was something void in Adam's struggle of his fate. He was perhaps too staid during a part of life that those of us who are the same age as him, won't be able to have the same understanding. Either way, there was something missing for that needed level of sympathy.What was missing was a humorous, touching and compassionate love interest. She arrived in the form of the beautiful and funny Anna Kendrick. She was our connection to Adam. She was the one that was able to meld the comedy and the dying-of-cancer tragedy into something that wasn't weird. I would like to say that she came into the picture too late and was used too little, but '50/50' was trying to make it more about Adam and all the relationships in his life.",7,1,2,18 October 2011
Get Him to the Greek," Not funny or original, and not well written
","Jonah Hill plays Aaron a young music producer who likes musician Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) and he's been charged to 'Get Him to the Greek'. The beginning of that sentence sounds familiar because this film is 'based on characters created by Jason Segal' (as written in the credits). At least they credited it correctly because they take nothing from 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' (2008). Just two of the same actors playing characters with some of the same superficial aspects and that's it.I like Hill and Brand in small doses, but they just aren't likable and talented enough to carry an entire film. It was all unfunny jokes and dragged out ad nausea. I don't believe there was any spoofing going on here, just trying to steal some once funny lines. They had a character copying Isla Fisher from 'Wedding Crashers' (2005) but she was just a cheap imitation.'Get Him to the Greek' didn't have anything very funny and nothing original and just wasn't well written. I would recommend re-watching 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'; it's just so much funnier and overall a better film.",3,3,9,15 October 2010
The Hangover Part III," Revisits Las Vegas but can't recapture the magic
","The good news is that Todd Phillips and co. figured out the mistakes they made with Part II. The bad news is that they didn't figure out how to fix them. Instead of just repeating the identical plot in a new location, the guys are back in Las Vegas with a plot involving fall-out from their previous actions. That's the good part. The bad part is that it's actually kind of boring and the jokes have become pretty tiring.Doug, Phil and Stu are delivering Alan to rehab (finally a place where he belongs). However, along the way they get hijacked. Marshall (John Goodman) and his team of thugs including Black Doug kidnap our Doug because the Wolf Pack needs to track down Mr. Chow and his stolen loot. So off we go to Mexico and back to Las Vegas on a ridiculous trail of crime.Just like Part II, everything is bigger and bolder, and it loses even more of the wit and creativity that we had with the original. There's also way more Chow. If you think Alan and Chow are funny in small doses, imagine how unfunny they become in large doses. The insolent and rude humour usually surrounding Alan that was introduced in the sequel is still very much present. The first off-colour joke that we saw in the trailer, really was just as it was portrayed in the trailer. Alan beheads a giraffe and that is supposed to be hilarious. Nobody laughed.Luckily Phil and Stu are always alongside the troubled man-child. Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper have quickly proved that they're the stars of this franchise. They're able to add a likable factor to the disastrous Wolf Pack that we're cheering for their success even though it's about time that we all part ways. Phil is no longer just the arrogant asshole who wants all women and everything else in the world to go his way. He has settled down and he does his best to settle the rocky relationships and situations around him.The beginning of the film takes them to Mexico in an attempt to befriend and then betray Chow. But that part moves surprisingly slow with our only two likable heroes not providing any of the comedy. When they follow Chow to Los Angeles, things do pick up. Alan meets a woman (his soul mate) and Phil and Stu use their smarts and charm to relive the glory days of The Hangover.This third story really didn't need to be told and we're left hoping that the Wolf Pack and their arch nemeses will learn to just let sleeping dogs lie.",5,0,1,8 June 2013
Easy A," 'Easy A' is enjoyable except for the annoying vocabulary
","'Easy A' has way too many similarities to the overrated 'Juno' (2007). Like Ellen Page, Emma Stone did portray her character, Olive, with humour and heart, but no teenagers talk like that! She's not indie-cool and smarter than everybody else, it's only young adult writers who wish they were like that (or perhaps a young adult writer who wishes he could sleep with Diablo Cody).Olive is ostracized at school because of a rumour of promiscuity. Knowing that the plot is congruent with Nathaniel Hawthorne's 'The Scarlet Letter', I was thinking that I should read that before seeing this film just to make sure that I catch all the subtle nuances, but no, there's no need, there is nothing subtle about this film. It's just a modern tale about exclusion and teen sex, but with a rather refreshing ambivalent take on abstinence versus promiscuity.The problem with 'Easy A' is that Olive and her classmates are not as smart as their vocabulary (and based on a few evident mistakes, the writer is not as smart as the vocabulary either). I'll let the parents slide because Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson were very funny and made me laugh through every scene. 'Easy A' is an enjoyable watch but only if you can get past the sesquipedalian loquaciousness.",5,0,1,31 December 2010
Jackie Brown," Slick characters and slick dealings in one perfectly executed film
","I never thought that I would actually like a Quentin Tarantino movie, let alone think that it's a brilliant film that should be revered. 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) was entertaining but most of his other violent, ridiculous 'artistry' I couldn't even sit through. 'Jackie Brown' though, gives us some powerful characters to connect to, a drug and money plot which for the most part makes sense, and relatively, very little violence.The eponymous Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a 44 year-old black woman, but I can't describe her using Samuel L. Jackson's words because they are all expletives. I am hoping that I'm allowed to laugh at Jackson's many racial, blasphemous, and offensive declarations because they were hilarious.The majority of the comedy is when we are being introduced to all the characters at the beginning of the film. Once we establish that Ordell (Jackson) is a very ruthless, rich arms-dealer, then we establish that Jackie Brown might be more like the opposite of him, a hard-working stewardess trying to make right in society. But they're friends and she's caught with his money and cocaine.After giving us some rich characters, we then get a plot. A plot which involves some very shady connections, and under-handing and double-crossing. But we're given everything we need to know so it's easy to follow, and then we get to guess who is actually working for whom and who is defrauding whom. And every single one of these potentially-suspicious characters is played by a great actor in a role seemingly made for them.'Jackie Brown' is filmmaking at its best with these vibrant characters, engaging story and the detailed use of style, song choice, and framing of shots to keep all of the connections alive. Who would have known that Tarantino knew how to write for, and dress, a woman so well?",10,1,3,29 May 2011
Moon," A limited atmosphere where Sam (Rockwell, that is) matters
","Astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is alone on the moon in a lunar module, save a computer named GERTY voiced by Kevin Spacey. Although we're never quite sure what his mission is, he becomes increasingly less certain about what he's doing there, how long he's been there, and how long he's going to be there. Internal conflicts abound, and 'Moon' does an outstanding job of portraying those internal and personal struggles that Sam is experiencing.It's a small film telling a small story where psychological science fiction meets character study. Rockwell, as always, is larger than life. His progressive disorientation and confusion about time, himself and his mission allow for so much thought and introspection for the viewer. A very welcome addition to the science fiction genre. Sometimes you really can do so much more with less.'Moon' tried very hard with its intriguing script, and they had a lot of choices to make. As with all films that have so many questions and options, some you won't agree with, some won't get answered at all, and some won't make much sense—at least according to the explanation that you have provided for yourself in your head. But in the atmosphere that 'Moon' created, Sam is the only one that matters, and oh, yeah, he does matter.",8,1,5,1 May 2011
The Social Network," A film not about Facebook, but the face of the guys behind the book
","'The Social Network' is a great film and it does deserve all the credit it's getting. The key is in how Sorkin crafted the story and the characters and then how the actors ably portrayed those characters.This isn't about Facebook, but more the guys, or guy, who invented it. And the way Sorkin presented these characters was perfect. I was never very sure about exactly what Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) was like but I could quickly get a handle on everybody around him: Eduardo (Andrew Garfield), the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer) and Divya Narendra (Max Minghella). They represented Harvard students, and they represented them accurately.I was particularly impressed with Garfield. He was the slightly awkward loner, the caring friend, the ambitious businessman, and the revengeful scorned friend, but most importantly by the end he was the one who I had to see through to get to the real Mark Zuckerberg. Originally I had said that Mark Ruffalo was my vote for Best Supporting Actor, but I might have to retract that statement. It's now Garfield. And of course Aaron Sorkin for Best Adapted Screenplay. This film wouldn't have been much without the incredible and interesting dynamics that Sorkin created.Upon it's initial release, I was quite put off because they basically marketed it as: A movie about Facebook, starring Michael Cera, and brought to you by the director of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. What about that statement would make me want to see this film? They should have tried something like 'A film not about Facebook, but the face of the guys behind the book. Written by Aaron Sorkin.' There, Columbia Pictures, 18 free words for you.I want to say The Social Network is the best college film ever made, but that is such a negative genre, and I don't mean to insult the film that way.",10,0,1,17 December 2010
The Great Gatsby," Famous scenes and symbolism re-imagined beautifully but also problematically
","'In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'' I have been frequently convinced that Baz Luhrmann does not know how to read, but I do have the advantage of literacy. However, I am not Nick Carraway and am not compelled to follow his father's advice that opens Fitzgerald's classic novel 'The Great Gatsby'.The first big problem with this movie version is that Tobey Maguire's Nick is not the same Nick that we know and love from the novel. This Nick is a quirky, agitated simpleton who has gone insane and has decided to become a writer. His voice and disposition was all wrong. Nick is no longer our credible vantage point into the selfish, boorish ways of the old money and new money of Daisy, Tom, Jordan and Gatsby in East Egg and West Egg. Much has been said about the lavish style of the film's sets and imagery and even more about the ludicrous soundtrack. But it mostly works. I don't think anyone can deny that the unrestrained money, extravagant mansions, brilliant costumes and choreography with a lively score just make the whole story seem more fun. I still have no idea what the point of the 3D was. Nick's bow-tie and the strange shooting style (mostly prominent early on) just made everything look cartoonish. At times, it looked like they were driving Gatsby's yellow car through the set of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. The cartoon- stylings mostly affected Nick; Gatsby's parties are always supposed to be at least slightly surreal.Problems definitely arise in the beginning when Luhrmann chooses to use his typical flash editing and put some party scenes out of order. The randomness of it all and Nick becoming even farther removed from the narrator we once trusted, was only re-confirming that this was in fact the disaster many expected it to be. But then we met Gatsby. And more importantly, we met Daisy. And even more importantly, Gatsby met Daisy. It is literally impossible to live up to the expectations about Gatsby – both the man built on wild whispers of him being a war hero, but also the literary character so ingrained in popular culture that he has earned the adjective 'great' in front of his name. Leonardo DiCaprio does as good a job as anyone could reasonably expect of him. He drew me in, and since Nick couldn't do that, it was even more than I could ask of him.One of the significant themes glowing throughout the novel is that of hope. Luhrmann even recognizes this with Nick referring to Gatsby as the singularly most hopeful man he has ever met. And then we would get a shot of the green light glistening off the water and through the fog from the end of Daisy's dock. The one thing missing from DiCaprio's interpretation of Gatsby was that earnest hope. I felt like a photographer on a model shoot: 'Now give me a look of hope! No, that's anger. Give me hope! No, that's sadness. Give me hope! No, that's frustration. Fine, just give me another look of despair.'Gatsby yearned for Daisy. And so do we. Carey Mulligan's Daisy was probably the most accurate character re-imagined from the novel. Starting from her introductory scene where she lay on the couch and the wind rustled her white curtains and her diamond ring sparkled in the daylight and then she turned to stare at Nick, she filled the screen with her ethereal beauty and faux innocence. I don't think it's surprising that the film takes its best form in the scenes where it's just Gatsby and Daisy.It's hard not to get wrapped up in the grandiosity of Gatsby, the grandiosity of the story, and the grandiosity of the film's visuals. It's a beautiful story and it does look beautiful on the big screen, but then comes the nagging suspicion that Luhrmann never actually read the novel. After all, half of the quotes are just paraphrased and are not the actual lines from Fitzgerald, and all of the scenes and famous imagery are only the ones that have seeped into the public consciousness (straight from the Cliffs Notes, perhaps). It should work well as a way to introduce another generation to this accomplished work of art, and I do applaud them for that, but it doesn't serve those who already know the book well.",5,181,300,11 May 2013
The Fighter," Enjoyable interactions with funny lines but fails to deliver anything meaningful
","Dicky Ecklund (Christian Bale) is 'the pride of Lowell, Massachusetts', at least he still believes that. Most people just see him as a crack addict. HBO is making a documentary about him, but 'The Fighter' is about his brother, Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) and trying to become a champion boxer.'The Fighter' has a slightly different feel to it than most gritty boxing movies both because of Bale's performance and because of the amount of comedy delivered with all the lines. Lowell is also the type of town that producer Wahlberg grew up in so the characterizations would have been accurate. But it is still exactly like every gritty boxing movie, and although I was relieved it had comedy, it was an awfully strange mix between comedy and drama. They made light of situations that one scene later or earlier they had taken seriously. Any emotional message that they were trying to deliver was lost.The interactions among all the characters were quite enjoyable, especially between Micky's 'MTV' girlfriend Charlene (Amy Adams) and his mother and sisters, and between Dicky and his mother. The performances were great with a wonderful quick wit and fairly interesting interactions. 'The Fighter' is a good film but it doesn't have the meaning or impact that something like 'Million Dollar Baby' (2004) has.",7,0,4,30 January 2011
High Fidelity," The realistic and insightful comedy to the hopelessness of relationships
","'High Fidelity' is really not a romantic comedy. It's a comedy about the hopelessness of men and romance. Rob (John Cusack) is thirty-something and he owns a record store, but that's just because that's what happens after you break-up with a girl in college and you go into a stupor for days, weeks, months, years and when you wake up you have aged but not matured. The fact that Rob and his fellow record store employees are not mature is an understatement. And that's where the comedy comes in.The narration of Rob's thoughts and the analysis of his 'top 5 break-ups of all time' are hilarious. The overall consensus that men are stupid and women are from another planet is taken to extremes, but realistic extremes. I, too, was shocked that his ex-girlfriend Charlie (Catherine Zeta-Jones) was in the phone book! Girls like Charlie shouldn't exist, but I'm not surprised that people like Nick Horny and his alter-ego Rob find them.Author Nick Hornby has an incredible talent for characterization; turning every day life into absurdities but back into realities and then making light of it all. Cusack fully embodies the immaturity and frustrations of slacker Rob, while Jack Black pours all of his manic energy into music exhibitionist Barry.Set in a record store with music lists like 'top 5 albums to play on a Monday morning', music is certainly a major part of 'High Fidelity'—but not overwhelmingly so. It's funny and meaningful for snobs and neophytes alike, but preferably somewhere in between so you can appreciate their jabs at the smarter-than-thou indie-hipster scene.Breaking-up may be hard to do, but 'High Fidelity' does it with a pumping soundtrack, insightful humour, and immensely quotable and hilarious dialogue.",9,1,2,1 June 2011
