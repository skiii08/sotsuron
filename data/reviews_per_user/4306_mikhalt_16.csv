Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Make Benefit Professionale film
",this movie was well produced and well put together I have to say. Although some of the political humours and satire may not be acceptable by all audiences. I am still impressed by its artistic integrity and honesty. Reminds of Brokeback mountain and my review on that which is a respectable film in my opinion. The cultural learnings in this film are quite interesting and in depth. Connected to the plot of the story of this journalist learning about America. Cultural understandings one might say and bring it out into the world that his character lives in. In my opinion this is when the Satire begins. I am not surprised at the ratings being high for this movie I mean we live in a country that rates Family Guy is good for babysitting our children.,8,0,7,16 November 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Excellently executed
","When I saw Mi3 I was impressed and I thought it was excellently executed; the Alias director has overdone himself in his first Big blockbuster movie directed effort. Tom Cruise acting and portrayal of Ethan hunt is awesome. The special effects, and plot in the movie really show the heart of the trilogy having this top level government operative. Being able to survive all this time is quite impressive. I am quite fond of the guns in the movie; and the pretty wife does add a bit of zing to the movie. Excellently executed I have to say this movie; what else is there to say about this. Tom cruise has overdone himself again; so go see this movie without hesistation.",8,0,1,27 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," New pirates movie awesome
","so this new pirates movie that I saw just saw yesterday has an alright plot. Not as strong as the first one, but still sufficient to deliver I guess. This movie has action, no romance, and lots of pirates. There are many times in the story where I knew what was going to happen. so that is not a good sign when you can predict the plot twist of the film. So those kind of things were not well hidden in the film. I am trying my best not to give out anything that has to do with the film. So go, take your children along to your local cinema and give it a try. You might like it yourself. In my opinion the first one was better, but this one makes up for the wait. For families this is a great film clean all the way through barely anyone gets stabbed and such. Thank you for your time Mikhal T",9,0,1,9 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Well made 3rd movie another ending at the end
","This new pirates film is well made, with a pretty good plot, not as good as the first one plot wise but still does not fail to satisfy. the sound quality in the film is very very high I have so say being a sonic hobbyist such as myself I have to say this movie fits the bill well. In terms of special effects etc. it was well done and polished. not as much action as I expected, and calypso wasn't that impressive when her essence was released, but I guess they ran out of money or something who knows. The romance parts of the film stay strong between the two couples, will ends up getting married in the end to ms. easy on the eyes swan. Although he cursed, you get a special thing at the end of the movie. 10 years later. you'l see. I hope they stretch this out. I figure why not I want to see johnny depp act like an idiot again",8,1,2,2 June 2007
Blades of Glory," in my opinion its funnier then roxbury
","this movie blades of glory when compared to other movies is pretty funny certainly has more of a developed storyline then the movie 300, well it was 0 by the end since they all got slaughtered bu errors. Then u have to look at the fact this story seems to come up short then other movies. Even lizzie mguire had a stronger storyline, but hey who can complain I mean its will farrel cant go wrong with that. I like the scene when he is on the treadmill and he began to sing the song by that black eyed peas group. my humps, he does it really well. I like his fake passion for ice skating really makes a twist on it. so for sure this is a good movie to see and a winner at the box office for sure.",7,1,2,2 April 2007
Ghost Rider," plot is not really there unless u a fan of the comics
","this nicolas cage fun quest is something that he can truly enjoy plying this role because he read the comic books as a child, for me I think the story line is not strong in the story similar not to startship troopers but more so like that of ultraviolet. Shady plot means weak characters means lame ending. But if you are a fan of the comic books and a fan of nicholas cage. or Eva mendes then this film is for you, but possibly not worth the trip to the movies, Alpha dog is good or babel. Check the Oscars this weekend to see some new movies. the flaming head and the chain isapparelty what is the only good elements of the movies besides it being based on a popular comic book.",6,0,1,23 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not bad Xmen 3
","Xmen 3 I found for myself wasn't that band had a weak plot mixed in with a lot of CGI effects; really showed how much computer stuff they can cram in in order to distract the watcher; from the plot of the movie. Know what I mean; this movie was not bad for this reason; its not as good as da vinchi, da vinchi even wasn't that good, but still is at an 8 out of 10 for me; Xmen has some interesting elements in it; but to many people died; and they really should have worked on expanding some characters instead of killing them off. I found this movie not as good as the first one that is my take take it face value. hope u liked the film I sure did",10,0,1,31 May 2006
Invincible," Excellent Footbal historical film
","This film is very excellent from the plot up. This movie is based on the true story of this normal guy, whom had a dream and chased after his dream to attain his goals. This is the same actor that was in 4 brothers he is a pretty talented actor. The Football aspect of this movie will really appeal to sports fans alike. The team-work aspects that are displayed in the football scenes are awesome. The Soundtrack sounds pretty leveled out and catchy. I think they use a Nickelback song in it. Side of a bullet if I am not mistaken. This will for sure storyline wise beat out Snakes on a plane, and is good to even show the family. The Film is owned by Disney so you can't go wrong with that. So I recommend this film to any sports fanatic, football fan or a family man.",8,9,18,21 August 2006
The Fountain," deep movie
",this movie starring Mr. High Jackmen and his theatrics is quite unique. As it talks about this fountain that gives Immortality to whomever that finds it. Then there is a romance in the film that is tied in with the plot which is a good element to the overall plot. I am wondering why Mr. Jackmen has chosen this kind of a role. Quite different from his roles in Xmen or on stage. I would love to see this movie if I had the chance to. Unfortunately It hasn't opened up in Canada. Here in Vancouver we don't get a lot of Indie Films opening up. Or films with small release like this Fountain movie. So by all means go out and see this movie. I personally will when it comes out on DVD.,8,4,15,26 September 2006
The Departed," interesting film
",this film looks interesting starring Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio. The plot looks strong combined with a talented cast of characters really build a fantastic story revolved around this head crime boss played by Jack Nicholson. I am no sure of the full story I just know this much. Looks like there is good enough humour in this story to get your attention. The development of the characters should be good as well as the storyline. I wonder what were the quirks on this movie were. Especially when they were on set I am wondering what were the funny things that happened. The director I have to say this film seems like his best effort to date. So I will have to check out this movie.,9,1,9,5 October 2006
Toy Story 3," best toy trilogy
","this movie toy story 3 showcases an all star cast with an excellent plot with great intrigue dialoge, character development. the plot unfolds so clear throughout the film and the characters carry on from the previous titles really well i have to say its one of those films thats u will never forget. Tom Hanks voice in it brought a peaceful calm nature to woodie as well as the other cowgirl and several other characters in the film. The avid studio work for this film must have been a large undertaking but still good nonetheless I slightly teared up at the end as the heartfelt moment as they experienced their upbringing and watching andy part with his fellow toys.",8,1,1,26 June 2010
300," this movie is well done
","this movie i have to say is well done but not really that good in terms of storyline because of the fact that there is no storyline just guts and glory for 1 hour and 52 minutes. every guy longs for war and battle its built into them, but too much of a good thing will kill you and this is it I have to say it just doesn't make sense ot me these kind of things. I will for sure see this movie eventually when I get a chance. Or when it comes to the cheaper theatre. This movie is not for children and definitely not a date movie unless your wife loves the movie saw or sin city. The graphics etc. are well strung together. so go see this movie its one of a kind.",8,1,4,21 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Excellent movie, I was in it;
","hi this Mikhal T; Fantastic 4 is an awesome movie; filmed in Vancouver; the storyline, and real life adaptation of the original comic book legend is professionally done. The acting, filming etc. in this movie was professional, and seeing first hand on set(I was part of the Red Porche 911 scene outside the stadium) I was impressed by the acting, and filming of the crew there. The people that I met on set there were kind, well kept; a lot of work was put into the making, and setup of the film; they even had me being a gentlemen where makeup. So I recommend this movie to anyone who is into this sort of action film; email me for questions MCstudios_Inc@Hotmail.com",Null,2,5,26 March 2006
Click," Click is professional comedy
","This new film click is really professional, mature comedy with a good number of twists and strong story developments. The story is compelling, deep, mature and funny. You will find though the types of jokes and even the subject matter changes throughout the story giving the viewer and interesting perspective into the characters in the film. Hands down adam wife in the film is hot. Just wanted to say that before continuing. Where was I oh yes the professional side of the comedy is the well executed performance on adam part and you can see his comedy act in this film to be showing signs of maturity, instead of the same child-like rambling that was in his previous films. The main plot of the story is quite interesting built around a remote of course. That remote controls your universe I am sure we would all like to take control of our lives. So go and see this compelling and kind of deep movie.Mikhal T",10,1,8,9 July 2006
V for Vendetta," Profound, professional, deep movie
","I have to say this movie is really awesome in terms of political topics and story lines deep and well made,the acting quality of Natalie port man is really professional and deep with her theatrical acting. She is beautiful as well so this fits her persona I think, not like I know her. The acting of the masked villain was well played, the backdrop of London, england and the political oppressing regime was interesting reminded me of the Berlin wall; and the whole revolution aspect and theme of the movie was quite, inspiring in its own respect; I am thinking of getting this when it comes on DVD. Props to the directors, writers and actors of this movie. have a good one MikhaltMCstudios_Inc@hotmail.com",9,2,5,26 March 2006
The Island," excellent movie
",this movie called the Island I quite enjoyed has a lot of depth and a beautiful women in it what more do you need. Well the state of the art car and boat doesn't do too bad in the film either. The Plot is well development with ideas that are crossing in terms of Total Recall and 80's Sci-Fi Movies. Although this film I have to say does not show the originality like a film like the Fifth Element or Blade Runner. I have to say this film was excellent to watch with good story. So for any Science Fiction fan this is a must movie to see alongside your date or lack there of. This is a suitable movie for mature audiences but for people that are younger especially younger children this film might be a bit too graphic.,8,0,0,23 October 2006
