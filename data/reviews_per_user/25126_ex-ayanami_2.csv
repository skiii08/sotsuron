The Incredible Hulk," Hulk!
","I've watched the 2002 version of Hulk. It was kind of boring, and I still don't understand the reason behind its ending, not to mention the fight at the end. So when I saw the trailer of Incredible Hulk, I was really excited. He looked angrier than the 2002 version in every aspect.The story line was well constructed, you will not be bored. The Hulk vs. Abomination battle is great. The infection of Mr. Blue's (Samuel Stern) head was a little bit confusing since he never reappeared again in the MCU.And then there was Tony Stark at the end. The Avengers is now in the air.",7,0,1,11 October 2016
Iron Man," I am Iron Man
","Tony Stark: I am Iron Man. The beginning was well thought. The Jericho Missile scene was awesome. The way he started the Mark II, which was one of my favorite suit, is still mind blowing up to this day. Gwyneth Paltrow was gorgeous with those red hair and really complimented Robert Downey on screen.The two bald villains are OK. The fighting in the end was average at the most considering that the suit of Obadiah is absurdly ugly. Overall, there's really nothing you can said against Iron Man.I enjoyed this one and unlike any other superhero movie, this brings a new level of excitement. The Nick Fury at the end credits signaled the start of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",8,0,1,11 October 2016
