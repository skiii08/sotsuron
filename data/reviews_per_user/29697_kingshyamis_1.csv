Skyfall," Not a true Bond film for the Mass Market
","So i was looking forward to watching the new bond movie, i went to the opening of a new Cineworld cinema and was very excited. i hadn't watched any trailers or reviews just i was hoping to see one of the best movies this year.15 Mins later, i was thinking the movie is slow and being longed out. but i was still giving the movie a chance. 2hours and 25 mins later i walked out disgusted!! i also did fall asleep for 20 mins or so along with many other people. I am one of those that likes the bond movies for the action, Witty comments, the ladies, and of course the gadgets... of which i found non of in this movie. There are people writing reviews in favor, however i feel they are happy due to the story giving some answers to old questions and making the story more personal to Bonds character. however compare all the other Bond films as being shown on Sky Movies 007 you get very upset at Skyfall.Sorry to say i will not be paying money to watch any further Bond movies in the Cinema. (please mind my spelling) i hope people can see where my view is coming from, i am so very disappointed and angry at what i have seen. The opening shot is good and seems like a good scene. But 1st 15 seconds are also disappointing.i leave it up to you guys.",1,40,88,26 October 2012
