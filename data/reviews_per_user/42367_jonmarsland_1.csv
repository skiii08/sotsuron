Iron Man 3," Did you all pay any attention?!
","Wah, plot holes, wah, mock villain, wah. Seriously, did anyone actually listen? 1. Mark 42: withstood Thor lightning but not super soldiers heat. IT WAS A PROTOTYPE. NOT FULLY ARMED OR COMBAT READY. And the suit in avengers 2 was a much more developed albeit earlier tech and combat ready.2. Ruined the Mandarin. Who's to say the mandarin doesn't exist. 10 rings as an organisation does. Killian just ripped him off. He never said he created the Mandarin, just the threat.3. Removal of the Arc Reactor. Why not remove in Iron Man 2? Because Stark would some way of regenerating the massive trauma to his chest. What could do that? Oh yeah, Extremis. He says he fixed it. Never said what he did with it.4. Mk42 wrecked by truck. Errr, yeah, it was barely hanging together thanks to massive damage suffered in the house attack, further damaged by the crash landing. And once again: A prototype.5. Finally: that last line: 'I AM IronMan' so you destroy your suits and find a way of regenerating damaged tissue. Can't anyone see the leadup to the extremis Armour, housed within Starks body???",8,0,2,4 July 2014
