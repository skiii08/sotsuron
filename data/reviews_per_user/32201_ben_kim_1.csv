The Ring," Best horror movie ever
","Being a major film fan and amateur critic, I had become extremely cynical about a movie's ability to chill me - until I saw 'The Ring' this weekend. I have not seen the Japanese original or sequels, but the American version ranks as the best horror movie ever for me.  Lacking the cheese and stupidity of gore-filled slasher flicks, but packing the serious punch of terror that even good suspense/thrillers miss, 'The Ring' breaks new ground in western cinema.  While a few of the plot details may be puzzling, watching this film is such a powerful visceral experience that you can't and won't be bothered by them.  I found 'The Ring' to be completely engrossing and ultra-creepy, and I left the theater feeling totally impressed and a little out of breath.  Not since I watched 'The Exorcist' on TV at a far too young age has a movie so effectively gotten under my skin.  Hats off to Gore Verbinski for a rare achievement.  A must-see for all fans of the genre and anyone else who can handle it.",8,0,0,20 October 2002
