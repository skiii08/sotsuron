The Blair Witch Project," Did Anyone Else Notice The Goof-up?
","I watched The Blair Witch Project for the first time last night with a group of friends. Although it was enjoyable, none of us were truly scared. We all know it is completely fiction, and there never was a Blair Witch, but that shouldn't have taken away from the supposed horror of the film. Honestly, the scariest part was the final scene. That's it. Also, I noticed something odd. I've heard that the three actors filmed the entire movie themselves. However, during the frames just after they've realized the map is missing I noticed there must've been a 4th person filming. Heather was sitting on the ground arguing with Josh about who had the map last. Heather isn't holding the camera; she's searching through her pockets. Josh is standing about two feet away looking down at her. He's not holding the camera. And Michael is seen in the distance walking away, further in the woods. The camera moves quickly from Heather to Josh as they continue to argue. In the meantime I see Michael walking further away. WHO IS FILMING?!",Null,0,1,6 February 2000
