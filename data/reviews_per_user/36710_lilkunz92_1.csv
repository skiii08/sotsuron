Mission: Impossible III," Can't wait for next one!!
","I didn't know what to expect in M:I 3 considering i didn't see the first or second one. It proved it didn't matter much since the storyline didn't depend much on the prequels. For a 2-hour movie, it sure was exciting and eventful! It was easily the most action-packed movie i've seen this year. The conversation at the end between Hunt and Brassell prove there will be yet another sequel. If it supplies as much action and a great cast as M:I 3, I'll see Mission Impossible 4 in a heartbeat. The only thing about Mission: Impossible 3 that nags me is the stupid red thing in a bottle that they refer to as the 'Rabbit's Foot.' Can SOMEBODY please explain what was up with the 'rabbit's foot' that everyone wanted so badly?",9,2,3,8 May 2006
