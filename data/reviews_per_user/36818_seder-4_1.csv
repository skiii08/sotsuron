Skyfall," Took everything that bond was and threw it in the trash
","Where do I start, Well I am a huge bond fan and I really found this movie to be a crap to my face and the franchise. the Craig movies in general were made as reboots as an answer to beat out the Bourne Identity movies which were beating bond in the box office. I am not a huge fan of Craig's bond movies but i don't mind Craig. The movies are just too far from what i loved about the bond movies. Going this pseudo realistic route is just outright stupid.Anyway let's review this crap. The actors themselves are great in the movie. All of them are fine actors who are doing their job. The story itself is horrible and for what it is, poorly executed . Bond isn't saving the world in this, just trying to protect M. Let's talk about Q. I actually didn't mind him. As much as i thought i would hate a young Q he worked as a character. until they decided to render him useless. Q gives bond 2 gadgets 1 being a gun that is attached to his DNA and only he can use(comes in use once). 2 being a small button that transmits his position if hes in trouble(this is not a gadget that is new). This is IT! Bond asks 'that's it' and Q replies and i swear this is the worst thing said in the movie and i almost left because of it 'What did you expect, an exploding pen? We don't do that sort of stuff anymore' That basically mocked Goldeneye (My favorite bond movie)the gadget used in a great scene in the movie. I felt as if they were mocking the fans who wanted gadgets. Q then says please don't break it 007. Keep in mind Q just met bond. How does he know bond is usually breaking gadgets. I did like how Q is now able to talk to bond during missions. that i thought was a good addition.They also introduce the car from the first 007 movie 'Dr. No'. But it doesn't fit in the time line as that car is fitted with the gadgets used in that movie. The movie took place in the 60's that could put bond to be around 80 years old since the new movie takes place in present day. He does win a similar car with casino Royal i believe but there is no way he outfitted it for use because there was now Q lab during these new movies. The villain played by Javier Bardem is a decent bad guy but he is totally a rewritten '006' from Goldeneye. He has almost the same reason for being bad. problem with his character is he was introduced way too late into the movie and get's almost no screen time. You never really get 'him' as a character. You don't fully understand him. He's just thrown in their and has a couple clever lines and then dies.(very anticlimactically)Anyway they decided to keep the bond tradition and give the villain some kind of scar. But it was done with Horrible CGI.I am not a fan of CGI I feel that it is lazy, ugly and really distracting to a movie. If you are going to go with effects, use practical effects. Anyway this whole section has to do with the action and horrible CGI. From falling people to Komodo dragons to Helicopters. For a movie that is trying to be realistic, having a komodo dragon come out (looking like it is straight out of a video game) and eat a thug that was fighting bond is just the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. It was seriously the ugliest CGI used through t the movie. There was also an intro scene with a motorcycle chase i have to point out, that had the worst Green screen when the camera would show bond riding the bike. It looked awful. Also who ever thought silhouette shots looked cool is an idiot especially overused ones.There's another scene where bond goes to his old house...yes i said his old house. They did it they tried delving into more of his back story to make is feel for his character and humanize him more. I cannot stand this. I loved that most of his past was a mystery. this adds so much more to your own imagination. Well that's killed instantly as they tell you his parents names and a bunch more i did not want to hear. Anyway they use this house for what I like to call the 'Home Alone' scene and the WORST scene in the movie. Bond who is known for taking out hordes of people on his own is subjected to hiding and planting traps to kill about 9 people. It was ridiculous and so hard to watch.That scene leads onto another scene where bond chases the villain but then a thug and bond drop into the ice (where realistic bond should have hypothermia or frozen to death) and then leads to another scene in a church where M dies and you are suppose to feel bad but you just don't. Because the movie spoke about her being replaced anyway. So in any shape or form she wouldn't be in the next movie. anyway the villain dies with a knife throw to the back and he's done. like i said, anticlimactically.After This movie I can tell you I don't want to see another new bond movie unless they go back to their roots. Maybe if they get Christopher Nolan considering he really wants to make one and he understands what bond should be. Also he doesn't use CGI.I give this '5 Moonrakers out of 5' just kidding 1/10 stars. Enjoy giving them money and making them realize this is what sells.",1,38,69,22 November 2012
