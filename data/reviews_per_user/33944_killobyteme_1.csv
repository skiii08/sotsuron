Requiem for a Dream," Art in images, dynamics and content
","Today is the second day after I've watched Requiem. So, the influence of primal effects is not present. I feel like I felt when I've read Dostoyevsky's Demons. The implications in my consciousness are massive... The movie shows the reality in the most genuine way, and the consequences of social deviations are dramatic. It's unbelievable! Both the creativity of the author of the book and of the producer. The movie involves psychology, social psychology, psychopathology, picture art and great music. The time line which is structured by the seasons is also a impressive way of integrating art. The only thing I have to do is to read the book to see if there is content that isn't shown in the movie.",10,2,4,9 February 2007
