Requiem for a Dream," Proof there is life after Pi...
","Just finished watching Requiem again and i have to say one thing: Well Done. Arno did a great job, a truly spectacular film that just totally surprised. His earlier work, Pi, was completely his baby and totally under his control. With Requiem, he had to adapt someone elses work yet still maintain his artistic integrity. If there are any doubts whether or not indie filmmakers are truly talented, please lay it to rest. The content of the film (incl. EXCSESSIVE DRUG USE, betrayal, deceit, lust, family, hope, failure, and utter physical and mental anguish) were juxtaposed insanely with fast editing, sweet camera work, and a visual style that no mere human being could ever dream for in a film. But the performances in this film were truly, truly magnificent all across the board. Jared Leto - crazy! Jennifer Connoley - reached Julianne Moores exceptional talent, and may very well have exceeded it under the circumstances! Marlon Wayans - utterly stunning in his portrayal as the straight-man role, no jokes, no silly sight gags, just very awesome dramatic power! Ellen Burstyn - whatever pre-conceptions i had towards her performance (i think the academy awards are more corrupt than american politics) were washed away when i experienced first hand the true genius of a disciplined actress who was so utterly committed to her role that i had to constantly remind myself that this was Reagan's mother in excorcist so many years ago. SHE DIDN'T JUST INHABIT THE CHARACTER SHE IS SARA, ELLEN BURSTYN DID NOT EXIST AT ALL! Also, a much needed mention goes to Keith David, a wonderful surprise in the film and the cast of Pi popping up allllll over the place! It's been a long time since i was touched by a film in this way, it felt so deep and incredible that everyone should witness what happens when a studio backs one of the greatest films talents in the world. Forgive the poor grammar and some spelling mistakes, please! I'm still trying to reuperate from my last viewing of the film...",10,0,0,20 August 2001
Fight Club," Fight Club, American film tragedy or just misunderstood?
","From the title, I'm sure many believed I would discuss how the film 'Fight Club' was a blatant display of contemporary fascism, but that's not what I think. Beyond the violence, the big names, the media attention, I saw a message and not just a film. Almost like the child-genius in 'Magnolia' telling his father that he needs to be treated better, I saw 'Fight Club' tell me I need to re-evaluate what is important in my life. This is not to say that the film has changed me in some grande way, sure I did change, but ever so slightly. After 'Fight Club' the purpose of film changed, that's minute in comparison to the great picture that is life. It's my humble opinion that a film like 'Fight Club' was totally misunderstood.Unlike many who saw the film, I left the theatre fearing physical pain. I now shudder whenever I hear a friend mutter that he wants to 'beat the hell' out of someone. It's scary that a strip of celluloid was able to do that to me, rather than further desensitize me towards violence, the film has caused me to avoid confrontation. I think that's wonderful, but a lot of people do not. A lot of people are disgusted by the film, simply because of it's vastly horrific violence. But truth be told the film does not even have as much attack on the human body as I was expecting. So what made it appeal to me, a 'modern teenager'?It was the director, David ('Se7en', 'The Game') Fincher. He's a visionary, I see him as one of the few young talents in Hollywood that actually have some sort of feel for what the camera is allowed to see. His directing is fresh, dark, gritty and especially URBAN. Through his previous works we have seen at least two sides of the class spectrum which have always shown some darker side of man. In 'Se7en', we witnessed the absolute hell that could befall a pair of civil servants, two officers of the law and though it was not a major display in the film, there had to be a point in the main characters' lives when they had to come to grips with what and who they were dealing with. Needless to say, there is a sad ending and a great tragedy. Meanwhile, in 'The Game', more than a year later we are treated to the darker side of the rich socialite, and we are treated to a happy ending. But in 'Fight Club', there was no happy or sad ending.There was loss and there was gain whether it was wanted or not. And amidst this, Fincher was able to take that whole idea of 'funky' and 'digital' to it's darkest, while he erased the classes which were present and highly focal in his other films. Indeed this is true as we see the various faces and races which the actual 'Fight Club' incorporates, mixed together trying to release some aggression. And things do get over the edge, but there is a sense of loyalty borne between the men who dare to journey into the darker side of himself. 'Fight Club' to the characters in the film was practically religion and a new way to live. They were better than most people in the real world, because they did not live for the material items, they were actually able to live for life. That means that they were living for something that material items and cool gadgets could not buy. Would it eventually lead to mass murder? Perhaps, but I think they would have gotten bored with it by the time it got that out of hand. I believe that much is true because, regardless of the new found strength they were given by 'Tyler Durden', they were still products of the Generation X. Basically they have all inherited some short attention span. It was a fad, nothing lasts forever in this day and age. Besides which, 'Fight Club' would have eventually become commercialized.Big industry is always looking for the next big craze, and I don't think that the members of 'Fight Club' would support something that could be commercialized. Once you commercialize it it becomes an easy target for merchandising, then they would be back at square one. But they can always live in the now and know that they were doing something different, doing something real, and doing something beyond therapy to help improve themselves.So I say to Fincher, and Palahniuk (for his original novel), and Uhls (for the adaptation to the screen), and Norton, and Pitt, and everybody who helped to make such a great film, and of course the Dust Brothers for an absolutely seamless soundtrack; Thank You! You have actually accomplished making a film that has actually entertained me beyond the visual and story and was successfully made in the 90's. Don't get me wrong, there are a vast number of incredible films made in the 90's such as 'Usual Suspects', 'Philadelphia', and 'Trainspotting', but 'Fight Club' was directed towards me, and that felt good, I felt appreciated. I could identify with the struggles like no other film before it, that just makes me feel great. I think it was misunderstood, maybe I'm right or maybe I'm wrong, but that still doesn't mean that it was a bad film. To conclude I would just like to say that I wish to read the original novel by Chuck Palahniuk, but half the adventure is actually finding a copy which I have unsuccessfully accomplished. It's a rare book, so there must be a good reason for it's popularity.",10,0,1,25 February 2000
Akira," Unlike a lot of N. American Sci-Fi there's no simple answer!
","AKIRA is an incredible, astonishing film. Yet, there's one thing you should know about the ending, rather the last 15 or so minutes of it. I've watched it so many times and to this day I still can't explain it to other people. I can't even explain it to myself. But don't let that keep you away from the film as it stands, in my humble opinion, as one of the greatest achievements of filmmaking in history. With an awesome cyberpunk/mutant-filled Neo-Tokyo backdrop. At the center are the inherent social problems and barriers that exist within people and government. This is timeless.There's a certain obvious truth, which lies in the film. It is the simple fact that we, as human beings, are simply not prepared. This applies to any and every aspect of our lives. The characters in the film are certainly not prepared for the things that happen to them. And this fact shows. Unlike many North American sci-fi flicks, there are no simple answers for AKIRA. It's depressing and at the same time refreshing to have an understanding that we are limited creatures. It's a harsh reality and a simple answer. For Tetsuo, the changes that he goes through tear his very mind, and humanity, apart and it's not just him.If given the unfortunate chance of suffering his same 'collision' with destiny it would have the same effect on anyone. And no matter how much we say we would be unaffected it's all just a lie to ourselves. To Tetsuo. When Tetsuo's hallucinations begin the result is only catharsis, and rightfully so. No one would ask to be put into his situation and as the viewer we must watch the madness unfold.Don't let the fact that it's anime steer you away from this compelling, and albeit twisted tale. The detail put into the imagery and story in the film adds to the unique and realistic feel, which AKIRA possesses. And there certainly wasn't any slacking in the story of the film as we are given an often thorough explanation of the events of the past, which have affected the Neo-Tokyo. Indeed, by the end of the film I felt like I had lived in Japan of the future, that's how drawn in I was. And still am. Whenever I am given the opportunity to watch AKIRA I must put off whatever I am planning to make room for this monster of a film.If you get a hold of this flick, and it's dubbed, make sure it's the old dub with the truly gravy melodramatic voice acting by the main characters. The new version has some crummy, by comparison, dubbing that is nothing short of inferior to the original.'TETSSSUUUUOOOOOOOO!!!''KANEDAAAAAAA!!!'What more do you need from a film, people????",9,1,3,22 December 2001
