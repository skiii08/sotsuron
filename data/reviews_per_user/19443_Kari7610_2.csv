The Blair Witch Project," I loved it but I can understand why some wouldn't
","This movie was incredible! I was literally on the edge of my seat waiting for what was next. Although I liked this movie, I can see why some people would not. You definately need to be open mined and have a very active imagination. If you are not or do not, don't bother watching the movie. It's that simple. I suggest to anyone who has and those who have not seen it, to do a little research. Look up things on the net, go to the web sites. You get more history and information that way and so many things are much easier to understand. Like the ending! The last 10 minutes of 'The Blair Witch Project' has been in my head now for three days! Good stuff. I would have to say that the directors succeeded in their goal 'to bring the horror back to horror films'. *****Most definately 10 of 10 stars!*****",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
