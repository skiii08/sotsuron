The Avengers," Awesome stuff.
","Positives: *The movie looks awesome, CGI is unobtrusive and the costumes look almost exactly like the comics. *Traditional but well told superhero blockbuster story, putting Michael Bay to absolute shame, simply by focusing on the avengers and not some lame characters no one cares about. *Every superhero acts like they should (except maybe Hawkeye, but he's the only one I don't know from comics) *Rescued the hulk from the absolute pits of the last two movies made about him and Mark Ruffalo made him the best part of the whole movie by far. *A satisfying conclusion with a very surprising (and exciting) reveal after the credits.Negatives: *Hawkeye doesn't leave much of an impression. *Enemy baddies could've been explained a little more than they were. *Kind of predictable, I guess. My two cents. Yeah.",9,3,7,28 August 2012
The Hunger Games," Meh.
","Positives: *Jennifer Lawrence was brilliant and convincing to boot in this movie, but then again, she's brilliant in everything. *Nice futuristic style going on, good sets (love the beard on that one guy) *Concept is great (no i have not seen battle royale)Negatives: *This movie's faults can be almost entirely put on the director Gary Ross. He clearly tried, at least, but the movie's screenplay is weak with mostly stock unmemorable characters and lame dialogue (especially from Hutcherson's character). The movie's major problem, though, is that its action scenes are some of the worst this side of a DTV Seagal vehicle, with poorly edited, choppy fight scenes and no sense of pacing or anything like that. *The cast members try their darnedest with the material they are given, most actually coming out okay, with the notable exception of Josh Hutcherson, who has an extreme lack of charisma and failed to position himself as a significant romantic rival to Liam Hemsworth's character, whether that whole thing was faked for the cameras or not. *The movie's ending is an extremely disappointing sequel baiting climax to a disappointing movie. So, my two cents. Later.",5,3,4,28 August 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Great conclusion to the epic Bat-Trilogy!
","Well, this is the end of the Nolan Batman movies and what a way to go!Positives: *Great looking film, slick designs for all the bat-gadgets, dark and grim looking, especially the second half, able to keep the bleak, heavy tone consistently throughout. *Soundtrack by Hans Zimmer suits the film well. *Mostly very well acted, Michael Caine and Christian Bale in particular giving it their A-game and being very convincing. *Good action set pieces and tight pacing make the film seem not quite as long and dragged out as the nearly 3 hour running time suggests. *Tom Hardy as Bane, despite the face mask thing, was amazing. Anne Hathaway's Catwoman is the best so far.Negatives: *The villain's motivation was quite frankly not as clear as it should have been. *Marion Cotillard seemed to be sleepwalking through the movie, her final scene being especially weak, which surprised me a lot.So there you go. My two cents.",8,1,5,28 August 2012
