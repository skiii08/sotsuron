Requiem for a Dream," Are we suppose to take this film seriously?
","***SPOILERS*** 'Requiem for A Dream' is a very stylish, extremelly well acted film. It held my attention for most of its running time. Unfortunately, it ends up being too preachy and over the top for my taste. Amputation, incarceration, psychosis and impossible prostitution (watch the size of that dildo!) are all cramped in the film's conclusion. I would have laughed...but it was all so disgusting and exploitative that I couldn't do it.  5/10",5,1,3,12 October 2001
Catch Me If You Can," Smart, subtle and deceiving...Just like its protagonist.
","***SPOILERS*** Having read Frank Abagnale's book, I was surprised to see how much I enjoyed the film. It is clear that both Steven Spielberg and Jeff Nathanson have captured the spirit of the book, which was without a doubt 'spiced' by the author (his cleverest swindle yet???) So don't worry about finding much sense in things like the escape from the plane through the toilet. Tom Hanks' character (Carl Hanratty) is an invention too, BTW. He was never mentioned on the book, but it's great to know that 'Frank and Carl are still close friends'. ;o)",9,1,2,21 February 2003
Memento," Disappointing
","***SPOLERS***  This is really a very simple story about a serial killer with the most exotic excuse you can ever think of. It's all style but not much content. Just like the overrated 'The Usual Suspects'. Telling a story backwards is not a novelty, but it certainly helps the film to look and feel smarter than it actually is. Entertaining but empty.",7,1,2,11 October 2001
Gladiator," If you didn't like this film...
","...then you probably were expecting to see another 'Ben-Hur', just as I was the first time I saw it. I felt extremely disappointed. I thought it was dark, boring and I wasn't even impressed with the F/X. Then I saw it again...And it was a revelation. Once you let the film speak to you in its own language (and not the one of the old Hollywood films) then you begin to savor it. Of course there are some ludicrous scenes ( the final confrontation between Commodus and Maximus, for example) that don't change even if you see it 10 times, but one must credit Ridley Scott for having the courage of giving us a new, more authentic look of that era, even though it was much darker and bloody than other representations we were used to see in film. Russell Crowe is perhaps the key to the film's success. His performance is outstanding. I just hope Crowe is not going to become the next Nicolas Cage. I'd like to see him taking more risks as an actor, as he has done in the past.",9,0,0,7 July 2000
Gladiator," I just don't get it...
","Why is so much people complaining about 'Gladiator' winning Best Picture and Russell Crowe winning Best Actor? I just don't get it. It is obvious to me that Academy members did like 'Gladiator' much more than the other 4 films nominated for Best Picture. And when they voted Crowe as Best Actor, they were stating that he ALONE carried the film. His acting is SUPERB. I'm pretty sure that those who question Crowe's talent are not familiar with his career. Try watching 'Romper Stomper' and 'The Sum of Us' back to back to see what I mean. 'Gladiator' is an excellent film. It was the year's best indeed. It's closer to Shakespeare than it is to 'Ben-Hur' and other Hollywood epics of the past. It's going to be an influential film too...just wait and see. 'Gladiator' is not 'Titanic' nor 'Braveheart'. It's a MUCH better film. Its heart lies in its hero, not in its F/X or action sequences.
