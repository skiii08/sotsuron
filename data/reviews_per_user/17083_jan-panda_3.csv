Skyfall," One of the worst Bonds I've ever seen...
","The media were promoting this Bond as the best ever, but we all knew that's just the way things are today and that all products have to be over-hyped to sell. I'm a fan of action films and the action scenes in Skyfall aren't even that bad. That heightened the grade a bit.Now to the bad part. What I didn't like in this one is the storytelling. There are too many plot holes and unexplained circumstances. I would define the 'Silva' storyline dreadful character development, because I didn't understand his motivation. He could've just killed M and get it over with. But NO he came up with a lifelong plan to destroy her and in the end just proved her right with all her paranoia about how terrorists are hiding in the shadows. I wouldn't go into details about all the plot holes because there are many. Like the one 'I wanted to get caught and I bombed the MI6 headquarters specifically to get locked up in the tunnels underneath the subway' trick. The script is awful and there just isn't enough logic in some of the twist and turns in this film. Maybe if it wasn't portrayed as serious and dark as it was, I would enjoy it. I remember some of the older Bonds as more easygoing and I missed that. Watch the film if you're a Bond enthusiast, you might like it.And sorry for all the grammar mistakes, English is my second language and also this is one of my first movie reviews.",5,7,16,3 January 2013
500 Days of Summer," Best motivational breakup movie ever!
",If you ever went through a tough breakup you know what im talking about. When you love someone you don't really need any reasons. You just know. The clues are there. If they don't love you back thats their problem. You'll get hung up and thats your problem. Feelings are not bound to be mutual. People go through phases that they themselves cant explain. We just explain things through cards!We don't find the words to comfort ourselves. How can we find words to comfort others? The massage is fine but surely under the weather. Its just funny.I loved every minute of the movie. Both leading performances were brilliant. Actually I was shocked by their performance. Id never seen nothing like it. It seemed so real though i knew it wasn't. Zooey was so cool and Gordon was so emotional. He really made the whole film. I cant really explain in words but as i said...It gives you motivation to go on. To explore yourself and collaborate with everything you have going on. To be bold and fearless. Its just so powerful when you understand the essence.Time goes on and Tom goes on as well. We all go on about our feelings so easily sometimes. We just don't have the capability to express them. He cant get over Summer and that is understandable. But when he does he makes a whole new life for himself. We want to see that. True changes come from within the changes we do ourselves. As funny as that sounds its true.I could go on but I think thats it for now...,9,0,0,24 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Are we all scumbags?
","No, absolutely not. Although most of us are.In this one you don't even have a chance... The protagonist is (or in my view an antagonist), although he is a total scumbag with no regard for anyone else rather than himself, portrayed as the good guy who came out unharmed. Who even gives a freaking s**t about him. In reality he's a small fish that got got. The ones that really caused the financial crisis... OK... It doesn't even matter... That'll be saved for another movie... Yeah right...On the other hand I really liked the dialouges and Leonardo's acting. Everything was so absurd and (for us mortals) out of this world. Like who rents or whatever a midget and throws him at a target... It's like watching Jackass... Thing after thing and that makes a story? Not in my book.No explanation for us mortals... What happened? What did they do? How did it came all to this? Oh, right... Thats too much for the regular viewer... They were just extraordinary people that sold junk bonds to poor and afterward rich people and did investment bank stuff. I just can't understand the 8 and over grade... There's just nothing special about this film and you can find that for yourself... Just go watch it's fun after all... Exuse my English... I'm still practicing :)",6,4,8,1 February 2014
