United 93," This is probably the worst movie iv'e seen
","Jeez, it's like a bad documentary, with poor actors, poor story and overly dramatized... It's highly unoriginal and i hate this 'movie' because it is incredibly cheesy and boring. Many have made films like this, patriotic ****, they try to make it look like those on the plane were heroes. How the **** can this 'movie' have so high ratings? If the incident had not occurred in real life i'd bet my hand this movie would have a rating below average. I'm not badmouthing the dead just the movie.We all know how its is going to end, and what happened, whats the point? There are no surprise elements, nothing new.I give it one point because its highly overrated. They didn't even try to add something new.",1,8,26,22 September 2007
