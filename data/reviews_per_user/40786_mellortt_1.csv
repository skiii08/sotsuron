The King's Speech," Better than i thought
","now i am one of these men who like wanted and sin city but i never thought i would like this. i watched the baftas and it won so many of them so i thought i would give it a go. the film is a good drama film with many swearwords. but i still don't think it should be a 15 just because of a bit of a bad language. there is absolutely no violence, so personally it isn't an adult film. some people under 15 will probably like this film. the film itself is all about king george and has some great performances from colin firth and helena boham carter. the kings speech deserves all the awards it is getting and could be this years best movie if harry potter ends up flopping.",9,0,0,9 March 2011
