Saturday Night Fever," Here comes the good music
","The success of this movie only relays on the performance of John Travolta, and the brilliant Bee Gees's musics. The rest of it, the story, the other characters, and the way of filming, is pretty bad.I haven't decide yet if it's the character Stephanie or the actress who plays her role (Karen Lynn Gorney) that is annoying me, but she really does ! Fortunately the sight of John Travolta dancing on the dance floor (damn he's a really good dancer) help us to forget the global aspect of the movie. At least, Saturday Night Fever gives a sincere vision of what American teens were like in the 80's.",5,5,7,12 July 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A perfect movie
","The Star Wars universe recovers its allure, and the use of the word 'war' in the title finally makes sense again. After the very disappointed Star Wars 7, Rogue one is offering a new story, which really stands up. We can feel the respect for the movies that were already made in the same universe, which is a relief if you are a fan, like me. The viewer's attention is total from beginning to the end of the movie. What I really enjoyed was the way the characters were presented, one by one, and their strong relationships. For once, I had the pleasant impression that the story was at the heart of the movie, and the characters were here to stand for a cause and not to make a presence and discuss about their lives. There was this very inspiring movement of solidarity and pure friendship between them. People fighting for what's right, and nothing else. I could mention the fact that Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor don't kiss at any point, how surprising? I mean nowadays big firms from the cinema industry, as Walt Disney and Lucasfilm, are making blockbusters movies based on the same weft: violence and love affairs. It really means the world to me that the characters from the movie have been all spared from useless visual and physical feelings, in a way the emotions become even more intense. The viewer is frustrated, he would like them to kiss, but there's not need to show it as we feel it. Not to forget that special effects are breath taking. We're witnessing beautiful landscapes and very realistic explosions. As if it wasn't enough, the presence of some well know characters form the Stars Wars saga, recreated thanks to CGI and old footage, is so well done that I almost missed it (I'm thinking mostly about princess Leia and Grand Moff Tarkin)Even if I wanted to, I couldn't find any negative facts about this movie. It's perfect at any point.",10,1,5,30 June 2017
Passengers," Your worst nightmare: alone in space
","Passengers is an original story that leads us to reflect, whether on human relations, human existence or even technical and artificial progress. Finally, these are questions which correspond mainly to the psychological field and which do not have all the time an answer (this is precisely what makes them annoying and hard to bear)The duo Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are doing pretty well. The characters they are playing are endearing. Forced to notice that one attaches immediately to the character of Jim, then to that of Aurora. At different stages of the film, I was surprised to ask myself 'what would have I done in his place?' Some choices made by the characters may seem unfair to us but they are finally justified. Indeed, the human factor is not to be neglected and is often put forward; the characters (and actors) go from laughter to tears with perfect mastery.The sets are impressive and the special effects are very successful (I think about the scene where Aurora's swimming in the pool, when gravity ceases, water in weightlessness is remarkably realized)Passengers allows us to observe a future arousing our curiosity but which, as we discover it, also gives way to fear and anguish. The machines can prove as beneficial as they are harmful, and this is what Passengers wanted to stage. Fortunately, love always triumphs (at least in films)A very good movie, captivating from beginning to end.",10,2,2,20 July 2017
10 Things I Hate About You," Not so interesting
","This movie is okay. There's really nothing special to it. Next to brilliant teen movies as Breakfast club and Clueless, this one can't compete. It seeks to get emotional but it wasn't at any point. The characters doesn't seem true and I don't feel like I should care about their love troubles. It'as a bit too superficial and stereotyped for me. I felt a bit frustrate as there was no lesson to learn from this film, not even a small one. I will keep in mind a global feeling of indifference towards 10 things I hate about you.",4,1,2,12 July 2017
Hitch," Ideal for evenings between girls
","Hitch is a movie that I've already watched many times, alternately with my family and my friends (Ideal for evenings between girls), simply a cult movie. Every time I'm watching it, it's a real pleasure; I can't stop smiling stupidly at the jokes and gags of the characters that are very endearing. Not to mention the remarkable performance from Will Smith, who knows how to play the cute and handsome guy who turns out to be also a sensible person. Regarding Kevin James, he has never been as funny. The quotes from the film don't cease to be amusing. In short, we forget everything during an hour and a half, we get back to reality with a huge smile on our face, a positive attitude, and the will to find (or to go find) the prince charming. In addition, for the fans of good music, the soundtrack is excellent; we go from Earth, Wind and Fire to John Legend, a real pleasure for the ears.",10,0,1,16 June 2017
Arrival," In a future not so far away
","Arrival is a poignant film with a rather simple and refined visual aspect, whether it is in the design of the extraterrestrials creatures (which makes by the way more credible), that of their ship (called 'shell' in the film) or in the creation of sets.I had the pleasant impression of a film which, for once, took the time to explain as clearly as possible the phenomena and actions that were taking place on the screen. Some scenes appear like deep breaths that leave space for reflection, both for the characters and for us spectators. In a sense I was even able to immerse myself little by little in the life of the heroine until fully sharing her feelings and her ambitions. I would also like to mention the correctness with which Amy Adams embodies the protagonist, which gives even more intensity to the situation. We follow with avidity the process of interpreting the language used by of the apparent alien visitors (Xenolinguistics), and subsequently of the powers that this generates when this language is mastered (for Louise Banks the possibility to know the future)A small default that would explain the note I attributed to this film (09/10) would be the lightness of certain dialogues that created a lag in relation to the tone and general atmosphere of the film. I speak mainly of some conversations between Louise and Ian punctuated by typical phrases, straight out of a romance novel. They contrast too much with the gravity of the situation, for we are still talking about the discovery (then taken as an invasion for some) of an inhuman kind. If this film has taught me something, it is that an event like this would cause our loss, the disappearance of the human species. Indeed, we would be unable to agree between citizens and heads of state, except that this time there will not be Louise to allow us to perceive the future and thus save humanity (although we can always believe it)Arrival explores a new side of the science fiction genre, which is proving to be very interesting and deeper.",9,1,4,20 July 2017
Music and Lyrics," Entertaining, funny and lively
","The come back is a great movie which tells a sweet and modern love story.Hugh Grant is hilarious (especially when he starts swinging his hips) Obviously we would all love to see Hugh Grant performing on stage a love song destined to us, what an amazing moment it would be! Drew Barrymore is so lucky.It feels good to reconnect with the 80's, plus the musics are surprisingly very good (I can't stop singing 'I said I wasn't gonna lose my head, but then pop! Goes my heaaaarrttt...)I spent a very good moment watching this movie which gives us an idea of how hard can the music industry be.Morality of the story: you never know where and how love can strike!",7,1,1,21 July 2017
