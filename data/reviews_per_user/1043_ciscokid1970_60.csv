The Blair Witch Project," Lost in the woods
","If you were around when this actually showed up in the theaters it was a strange sight. It was un-watched for about 2 weeks then someone spread the rumor that is was a true story of amateur film students who found a real witch. All of a sudden people started watching it.I think it is one of the first movies to become famous via internet. Of course there are a lot of 'film students' who love the idea of this movie that gives them hope of one day duping the public in the same way and making some money for a crappy film.In reality it was not a true story, because even really stupid people could not do the moronic things these 'educated college students' did. But it was different, full of amateur acting and amateur shooting, and writing so bad I wonder if a script even existed. The story moved way too slow, and did not have enough clarity to keep you in suspense. But the worst part about this was the filming, the camera hoping up and down is almost enough to make you sea sick.Really what kind of idiots go investigate a 'witch' with NO GPS, NO real Map or compass. Oh and no phone or emergency radio?...geez.This is one of those rare things like Pet Rocks that gets unexpectedly hyped up, reaches a point that everyone says hey I got to see that. Then they go watch it and say to themselves 'wow that was a waste' But then they are afraid to say how lousy it was because they will seem un-cool.All I remember is the Hundreds of copies of this movie for sale at $1 each and still nobody buying them.",1,3,6,17 August 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," finish the story started by Kill Bill 1
",I knew this movie would be different from Kill Bill 1. It was still good although did not quite live up to what I was wanting.This movie plays more on the arduous pursuit of Bill that requires patience instead of slashing your way through the bad guys.I enjoyed the Uma Thurman training which pays homage to many great kung fu movies of past.As in all Tarantino movies Madsen's character is good at being bad. And I also enjoyed the fight between Daryl Hannah and Uma Thurman.But this movie was missing a major fight scene. It was missing some sur-real scene such as the cartoon development of O-ren Ishii. and was certainly lacking in the final duel.But I still enjoyed it.,7,0,1,25 September 2007
Changeling," WOW...outstanding all the way around
","This is one of those movies that blows you away in every part of the movie experience. Clint Eastwood did a brilliant job of directing. Michael Straczynski outstanding writing (from a man who has written a lot of good stuff). Angelina Jolie became the role so well that she seemed natural, and she looks brilliant in 1930s getup. She deserved the Oscar for this (Winslet got it for the Reader, not as good a movie) Ohh and Jeffrey Donovan did such a great job of being a bad guy that you actually start to hate him.I do not want to give hardly anything away.I will say that a good movie tells a story. Great movies have multiple themes, this movie manages to tell 3 powerful stories. They center around the struggle of a single woman trying to find her child.More and more I appreciate movies shot in a certain period of Americana, they spared no expense here. Cars, clothes, advertisements even the little things like period skates, mailboxes and matches. This should have won Oscar for cinematography...was WAY better than winner Slumdog millionaire.What is incredible is that it is based on a true story...holy smokes!! Has some scary parts so not recommended for kids under 13...uless you want to use it as a warning for stranger danger.Outstanding!!",10,3,6,25 February 2010
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Brilliant series of practical Jokes
","This movie was a lot better than I expected it would be. There were times when I laughed my posterior and there were a few times when I said, 'Man I did not need to see that'.The funniest thing about this movie is that just about all the people in the movie are normal people in everyday life who are un-knowingly part of this satire movie.I find it amazing how he being such a pain the butt did not get punched out by someone. Well he almost did in the NY Subway.Strangely enough some of the funniest stuff is in the DVD Extras. There is a part where he is asking a grocery store guy about cheese, pretty much the same question some 100 times...either the grocery guy was extremely polite or he had no idea he was being punk'd.The movie may have went on a little too long and had some stupid parts.Worth renting maybe watch it again.",7,0,1,21 August 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Same formula different actors
",What happened here...The first Hulk done in 2003 did not work out like the other superhero movies...so hey lets get all new actors make a bigger uglier bad guy and see what happens.Seriously disappointed that they replaced all the actors. Although I will say Tim Roth is a fantastic bad guy.I did like that the new story showed more occurrences of Banner/Hulk helping people.I am starting to think that Hulk is not a Big Screen superhero. Hulk only gains depth when he is non-Hulk which means to understand Hulk better there will be less action...and less action means no box-office boom.,6,1,4,17 January 2009
3:10 to Yuma," Starts with a bang...ends with a WHAT ?
","I am wondering if any of the first 1400 reviews for this movie have actually seen the movie or are just in love with Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. I am thinking the positive reviewers both on line and in the news papers only saw the first half of the moviewhich was good. But the second half of the movie was terrible.Caution this review contains some spoilers.but you may thank me for them.The movie starts off very good. Bale's character is set up nicely as a father who is trying yet failing in vain to provide for his family. The setup for the first wagon chase scene is good and the shooting (both camera and bulletsha ha) are brilliant.I am happy to see that Peter Fonda's character survives this scene because his character one of the few bright spots of the movie. He plays a tough, worn and battle tested bounty hunter / coach transporter / tough guy.But soon after Crowe's character is captured the story goes south in a hurry. Now do not get me wrong I do not expect script and story line perfection but this movie had holes so big you could drive a stagecoach through them.First of all no experienced tough guy would handcuff a guy with his hands in the frontduh you handcuff them in the back. This ends in the death of the most colorful character in the movie. Then after that nobody bothers to tie up the bad guy during the night timewhich ends in the death of another guy? Then the bad guy kicks one of the good guys in the headand none of the other 3 armed good guys bother to stop the bad guy? All during this time the Bad guys gang makes up 80 miles and ends up being only minutes behind themhuh does anyone remember that horses do not move that fast for that long? But the ending takes the cake, in some attempt to not end in typical western format (so many have been done that there are very few new endings) they have the bad guy help the good guy so he's not shot by the bad guys gang, because the bad guy all of a sudden develops a feel good conscious for the guy who is trying to send him to prison and be hung? What. To reduce the payoff even more neither the good guy (or the good guys son) gets to kill any of the bad guys gang which truly deserve it, no instead they are killed by the guy they are trying to help escapewhat the  kind of ending is that? Ohh I was not the only one disappointedthere were other people shouting out 'ohh mans' and 'what kind of ending is that' You are better off renting one of the old Sergio Leone's movies or Eastwood flicks than burning money on this movie.",4,0,1,23 August 2009
Se7en," Brilliant bad guy with frustrating ending
","This movie is a cross between Silence of the lambs and Bone collector. There are some very clever investigation scenes and clever writing and set creation.This movie was a showcase for Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. This movie had one of Morgan Freeman's best roles where he plays a educated, intelligent and experienced detective. Brad Pitt has a role but is not as impressive.This movie certainly had a new approach to police / horror movies. This movie and Silence of the lambs brought a whole new level of gore and horror to mystery movies. This is not a kid friendly movie and does not have a happy ending.",8,3,4,8 September 2007
Inglourious Basterds," Batter UP
","Ohh Yeah this was good fun. Quentin did a good job with this movie. The story line was brilliant, acting from everyone was outstanding and some of them in multiple languages. One of the best things about Tarantinos movies is that the BAD guys have fantastic roles that inspire great actors to perform splendid. This movie had lots of good old violence, but of courseit is a Tarantino movie after all. It had a couple of the Tarantino trademarks, which a true fan will appreciate, like side clips showing characters origin and on-screen labeling of person, places or things. The film has a beautifully rich color and outstanding cinematography, why can't more films look like this! Movie was almost 3 hoursbut only dragged at small points. I do not want to discuss the plot to much because I do not want to give it away.Yes it has violence and foul languageso do not take your kids.Plenty of bloody violence, plenty of witty dialogue, plenty of interesting characters.The only negatives are some scenes drag on a bit and some more action scenes would have been appreciated. I would have liked to see a little more batting practice.Not as good as Pulp Fiction but better than Deathproof. I give it a solid 8 out of 10. Will watch it again on the big screen then snatch up the DVD. I hope the DVD has some extra scenes.",8,0,4,26 August 2009
The 13th Warrior," A good hero with a sword movie
","This is a great movie for the Conan the barbarian / Braveheart crowd. Well worth watching when you are in a 'guy movie' mood. The picture and sound are very good. The story line is very solid and has a good flow. It was one of the more enjoyable Antonio Banderas movies I have seen.Story starts off with two Arabs traveling in exile way up in Scandinavia during the 1000s. They meet a clan of Norsemen who are visited by a messenger from a nearby tribe that needs help against a evil. Banderas character is chosen as the 13th warrior.What gives this movie its edge is the contrast in methods of Arab warriors and the completely different philosophy of a good horse.Plenty of swords, blood, hacking and screaming. The only place it looses points for me is not enough battle scenes.",8,1,2,23 April 2009
The Fifth Element," Awesome sci-fi action movie
","This is one of the best sci-fi action movies in the last 20 years. It This was one of Bruce Willis best action roles since Die Hard. Gary Oldman is a brilliant actor and truly excelled at being a bad guy. This was also the beginning of Milla Jovovich's action movie career. Even the supporting cast was fantastic even the over the top Criss Tucker. Movie watches like a comic book on screen, it was written by Luc Besson which is the same guy who wrote Femme Nikita and Point of no Return.This movie is so good that you can watch it over and over again. The story is solid and moves at a good pace. The special effects are well done without being too over the top. And even though this DVD was made in 1998 sound brilliant. There is plenty of gun fighting and explosions...and as a added bonus Leeloo has some impressive fighting scenes.Willis plays Korbin Dallas who is a Taxi driver in the future who happens to be some retired special forces guy. He ends up giving a ride to Leeloo and saving her from people who do not understand who she is. She is there to save the world.",9,3,6,25 April 2009
Hot Fuzz," Not even close to Shawn of the Dead.
","It moved a bit slow for me, as so many British comedies do.But there are great action comedies like Lock stock and 2 smoking barrels or snatch.But I was expecting so much more from this...more than it could deliver apparently. For some reason scenes like Simon Peg finding Nick Frost and takes him in for drunken disorderly and picks up a bunch of others along the way, is not extremely hilariousonly mildly funny. I know the story does not make real sense, it is not supposed to it's a comedybut the comedy was so mediocre to me it had me trying to hunt for a logical ending.Not even close to Shawn of the Dead.",2,5,12,25 September 2007
The Town," WOW...awesome movie...will be re-watched
","Wow...I mean really wow, this movie is one of the best character driven action films in a long time. This is right up there with Young Guns, Public Enemies and Heat as far as excellent cop vs bank robbers. If you liked The Departed or Public Enemies...you will love this movie.First a warning, mild nudity, violence and Lots of F bombs. Not that I am complaining in fact the way this part of the world (Massachusets) uses the F word is almost an art by itself. Props must be given to Ben Affleck here, He Wrote this movie, Directed this movie and Stared in this movie. Jeremy Renner fits perfectly into his role as 'pain in the A$$ always in trouble best friend'. And Jon Hamm is brilliant as the FBI guy out to get Affleck. Even the smaller parts Pete Postlethwaite and Chris Cooper are outstanding.The plot is flawless, moves at a nice pace while not giving itself away. The prep and shooting of this movie shows off the greater Boston Area in a great way including giving props to Fenway Park. The action is outstanding without being ridiculous (hard to do with today's action hungry audiences).",9,0,1,21 December 2011
Shutter Island," Interesting story twists overdone and too long
","If you liked Kafka, Identity or Slaughterhouse 5, you will probably dig this movie. This movie starts out with DiCaprio's character going to some nut house island jail to investigate some escaped criminal. People working in the criminally insane jail start to become uncooperative and suspicious. The story is mostly a 'what is going on here' after that.First I will tell you what I liked. I liked the set design, lighting and cinematography. The movie is shot on a island fortress/nut house. There is a wonderful mix of color and lighting for the scenes and the flash back scenes look great also. I liked the top notch actors doing a great job Ben Kinglsey, Max Von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, John Lynch and others. DiCaprio and Ruffalo did OK. Most did a brilliant job of making you not trust them. Things I did not like. I did not like that the movie over stretched to 2 1/2 hours. There are some scenes that go on too long or some that do not fit at all. I did not like the storyline of the second half...it felt kind of thrown together and the ending was weak and inconclusive. I did not like twisting characters roles and not giving any back story.I liked it...but will not watch it again. Worth Renting",7,1,3,24 February 2010
Lost in Translation," Lost in sleep
","This movie will put you to sleep...the music...the story...the acting. The only bright spot was Scarlett Johansson who is starting to develop in to a good actress. But if you want to see Scarlett in a much better movie watch 'Girl with a pearl earring' a far more interesting movie made in the same year.The story centers around 2 Americans in Japan that are developing a slow moving friendship. There are so many slow scenes in this movie that do nothing but allow you to start to nod off. The soundtrack i swear was designed to put you in a coma.There is NO WAY this movie was the 'Best Writing' Oscar of the year. Last Samurai, Cold Mountain and even Finding Nemo were far better writing than this boring waste of time.You know this is starting to get old. Sofia Coppola makes a barley digestible movie...but because she is sofia coppola...it MUST be a masterpiece. And even if it stinks...well then it is praised for its raw approach and 'good try'. Virgin Suicides has been the only movie that I would consider a success.So in short...if you want to see Bill Murray at his best...Watch Groundhog Day. If you want to see Scarlett at her best watch Girl with pearl earring. If you want to see sofia coppolas best...turn off the TV.",4,2,4,12 May 2009
Full Metal Jacket," One of the best military movies ever made
","The most 're-watchable' movie that Kubrick ever made. It was also the least Kubrick-y movie that he made, in other words it does not have the signature color scenes, strange lighting, ultra odd characters or strange story twists.This movie made the career of Ron Ermey, he has so many on liner insults in this movie that you could fill a book with them. He fit the part so perfectly because he spent over 10 years in the Marine Corps. In fact this movie has been so watched that a true fan can mouth along with most of the insults. Ermey's part in this movie has made him immortal, he will be forever linked to this movie.The supporting cast was also excellent, this movie showed the rise of excellent actors such as Matthew Modine and especially Vincent D'Onofrio. D'Onofrio's part as Private Pyle should have won an Oscar, he nailed the part as a mentally challenged cadet that twisted to the dark side.This movie got snubbed at the Oscars, one factor could be that it was so dark and negative that many people were put off. Another thing was that 78 was the same year that The last emperor and Fatal attraction came out.The only reason this movie is not a perfect 10 is because of the non-climactic ending. I love Kubrick films but his endings have never been memorable, his films always peak at about 20min before the end of the film.My favorite line is 'I do not discriminate...to me you are all equally worthless'",9,1,1,27 September 2006
Burn After Reading," Waste of a Rental...I want my $1 and 2 hours back !!!
","If you are the kind of person who enjoys watching OTHERS play chess. This movie is for you. If you are actually wanting to see a movie with a plot, story and a Ending...this is not the movie for you.The movie starts interesting with Malkovich sounding off as he is being fired. (NOT a spoiler since it happens in the first 5 min of the movie).It pretty much slowly staggers downhill from there. There was some potential here some characters were complex and interesting such as Clooney, McDormand and of course Malkovich. But all the actors were part of this weak web of a story.Imagine Fargo, but remove the good story. Imagine Lebowski, but remove the quotable lines.You wanna watch a Coen movie...Rent Raising Arizona, Fargo, O Brother where art thou or No country for old men.",5,2,5,20 June 2010
Watchmen," Attack of the blue schlong
","I have read the comic books, long ago made by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. They were my first read of British comics, interesting so I figure I would give the movie a chance.I understand they started by killing the comedian to draw the audience in, but I would have preferred if they kept the story chronological. The action was good but could have used more back filler showing where each of the characters came from. Some plot holes here some huhh store bits there.Then and now my favorite character is still Rorschach. They could have made a movie about just him. I will say what is up with giant blue schlong constantly flapping away. Jeez at least they could have balanced it with some more female nudity. Was really hoping to see Silk Spectre in her young vibrancy.I would say 'rent it' for first timers, or 'buy it used' if you are a watchmen fan. watchmen fan.",7,1,5,23 August 2009
Little Miss Sunshine," Little bit funny, little bit drama with a lame road trip
","I was not sure what to expect of this movie. My wife has this sick obsession to watch ALL the movies that win Academy awards. This movie won 2. Well we rented it, we saw it, NOTE even though this movie has a kid in it...IT IS NOT FOR CHILDREN...it has some serious adult subject matter, drugs, suicide, teen depression and homosexuality.It started off funny with everyone at the dinner table. I know Alan Arkin pretty much won the Academy award due to his fantastic ability to deliver the F word. Most notable was his phrase 'What's that, chicken? Every night it's the f**ing chicken! Holy God Almighty! Is it possible just once we could get something to eat for dinner around here that's not the god**med f**ing chicken?!' For some strange reasons fans of this movie like to say that it was unpredictable. It was pothetically predictable. You know that the Father character was not going to sell his self help method. You knew Abagail was not going to win the contest. You knew that the brother would eventually start talking. The only surprise was Alan Arkin dying...which is too bad he was the ONLY entertainment in the movie.I do predict that Abagail Breslin will become a impressive actress. But I base it mainly on her ability to take on serious roles and roles surrounded by other serious roles. I still liked her more in Raising Helen, The Ultimate Gift, and No Reservations.This is yet another movie that somehow is in the top 250...how?...I do not know. I have no desire to watch this again.",5,1,5,3 April 2009
Spider-Man," Made me feel like a kid again
",This is the most anticipated movie of all time for me. I have been waiting for special effects to be good enough to create a hero like spider man and make him look lifelike. And most certainly it is one of my all time favorites.No superhero ever created has had the popularity that Spiderman has and his longevity is well Amazing. The reason that most people like Spider Man is that they identify with him is that he is the most 'human' of the superheros. He is a teenager with money problems and girl problems and makes mistakes. This movie was beautifully done and stayed true to the character (with only some minor mods). The build up of the character is great and story line moves nicely. The movie covered a lot of ground yet still did not bury you in details. All the actors they got for this did a great job. It is nice that Stan Lee finally got movie making technology to catch up to his fantastic imagination.,10,0,1,27 September 2006
Aliens," Best of the Alien films
","Certainly the best of the Alien films. This movie is great on so many levels. One of the best SciFi / Horror films ever. It is one of the best Female Hero movies of all time. And it even has enough explosions and firefighting to qualify as a 'Guy Movie'.Yeah I liked the original Alien movie because it was well acted and had a fantastic idea. And it was certainly the first time I ever saw a evil creature pop out of someones chest.But the second one was absolutely fantastic. More monsters, more explosions, improved she-hero and even a bit of comedy sprinkled in there (thanks to Bill Paxton's character).This is still one of my favorite movies to watch in my Home theater room due to the brilliant filming and sound.One last thing...Sigourney Weaver holding heavy firearm...very sexy.",9,2,5,30 October 2006
No Country for Old Men," Whoa was this a Hollywood movie or European movie
","The story starts great, Josh Brolin character stumbles upon a situation...drug deal gone bad. The stoy is based in the 1980s drug trade along the Texas Mexico border. 80% of the story goes fantastic, smooth plot very few holes...fighting between two stars could have been a bit more 2 sided...but the ending...damn...you can not do that to American audiences. I loved cinematography, great job of showing Texas landscape (some filmed in New Mexico). The acting was fantastic. The actors were great all over. Javier Bardem is finally getting to show English speaking audiences what a great actor he is. He is a absolutely wickid bad guy...but come on how can he get away...jeez.By the near end of the movie...you loose perspective of who's story this is Josh Brolin (guy in over his head) or Tommy Lee Jones (small town sheriff) or a stretch here Javier Bardem (the bad guy). But the ending stinks...I am sorry, bad guy wins does not do well here as you can see by the sub-par box office numbers this movie hit.",6,1,4,17 January 2009
District 9," Some good scenes with a lot of filler
","Wow I had great hopes for this movie. Sad to say they were not met. It bounced back and forth between trying to look like a documentary, conspiracy drama and sci fi action movie, in result did none of them well.This movie is NOT original people ! There is a much better movie made over 20years ago called Alien Nation which was infinitely better. Supposedly they only spent 30 Mil to make this movie, but to me it looks like a garage movie that cost 3 mil.The TV ads for this movie contain just about every action scene in the film. So if you go looking for action you will be greatly disappointed. I will say, the alien technology produced some awesome booms and bangs, and the mechwarior was cool. But there was not enough action scenes to make this film worth watching on the big screen.The storyline started really bumpy because the documentary / interview section wasted valuable 'get the viewer hooked' time. And the Aliens trying to flyback home was muted compared to the 'lets exploit them for the weapons'.The movie sets itself up for a sequel, but does not make me hopefull. I think once word of mouth gets out it will quickly slow to a crawl at the box office.In my opinion rent or buy a different movie and stay at home. You are better off watching Alien Nation, Independence Day or War of the worlds.",3,5,14,16 August 2009
Saving Private Ryan," So good you forget that it is a war movie
","This is one of my favorite films of all time. I can watch it over and over again. It also has one of my favorite actors of all time, Tom Hanks. This movie should have been Tom Hanks 5th Oscar but for some reason the 'academy' has some bias against him.Many people have said that the start of this movie is the most intense, realistic capture of the invasion of Normandy beach. In addition the shooting of the first part of the movie puts you inside the action along with stunning 5 channel sound that places bullets, bombs and screams all around you.Does not stop there there is plenty of action in this movie. It shows many sides of humanity during the war and you even see the impact of all sides US forces, German forces and by standing citizens.This movie to me was the best film of 1998. Unfortunately 1998 was one of the most competitive Oscar runs in history. Titanic, Shakespeare in love, Elizabeth and Life is beautiful all competed that year. And as always the Lovey-dovey movies mostly win the Oscar races.Still this movie was so great that it spawned a HBO miniseries that was equally great 'Band of Brothers'.This is my favorite movie from Spielberg.",10,6,10,27 September 2006
2012," The kind of movie meant for the BIG SCREEN
","OK this movie has some awesome special effects. Seeing volcanoes blow on a proportion that can change the landscape. Tidal waves that can crest mountains and earthquakes big enough to makes cracks visible from space. Lots of awesome visual and sound special effects.The story is OK...humans trying to survive. Concentrates on a divorced dad trying to fly away from the disasters and can drive on earthquake, lava ridden earth like an Indy 500 racer.They loose some points for the artificial drama injected (the saved are the rich and powerful, not the lottery system like in Deep impact). All though makes you think...time and time again it has been shown the rich and powerful save themselves at the expense of the under classes. (AKA Titanic syndrome)It is like a geology students dream movie...lots of props for those who study rocks and cracks in the dirt. Not that often that an earth scientist is one of the main characters in a movie.ANYWAY...movie has lots of cool special effects...This is one of those movies you MUST see on the BIG SCREEN. Like Independence Day and Armageddon.Worth the matinée price.",7,0,4,23 November 2009
Kick-Ass," Ohhh yeah that was a superhero movie!
","I will avoid giving too much away. Here is my short summary: Imagine Tarantino directed a cross between Sin City and Power Puff Girls movie. Now add lots of gory violence with plenty of money shots. Do Not take your kids it has lots of violence and some bad language and sex, well deserving of R rating.Thank goodness the trailers have not given too much away with this movie. You think it is going to be some movie about one dorky teen who is a Spiderman wannabeNOT! The movie has multiple stories working at the same time.Matthew Vaughn hit this movie out of the park. This is only his 2nd major budget directing job, and his 3rd writing job. Ohh and he also Produced this movie so he should be reaping some major bank for this.Aaron Johnson was OK in this movie. Christopher Mintz-Plasse was his dorky self. Nicolas Cage did great in a medium size role. But it was 13 year old Chole Moretz who stole this movie, stabbed it then set it on fire! The movie is full of clever lines, comic fanfare and even pokes fun of superhero movies. This gets my highest rating: Run to see this movie then buy the DVD for watching at home.",10,5,16,20 April 2010
The Hurt Locker," Good...but NOT better than Avatar
","OK I am still emotional...Just saw this movie ROB Avatar for best picture. This is a good movie, just NOT a GREAT movie.OK I got that out of my system.I do not want to give too much away. is a movie about the bomb experts that are working in the battlefield. It does more that just show explosions or failed explosions. It prys into the life of SST James, played by Jeremy Renner. The filming is well done with locations closely resembling war torn Iraq. Kathryn Bigelow did a good job directing. But Oscar for Directing....ehh.Things I did not like: I have met Bomb specialists...and they are NOT strung out with a death wish like Renner portrayed. Bomb experts are meticulous, calm and sticklers for safety and procedure...or they end up dead that simple. I did find the movie a little long. At the same time I felt there was not enough story on his home life near the end especially the strain this job is placing on his family. The ending could have been better.I liked it, worth a Discount Rental (but it is not even close to Avatar, or Blind Side, or 9, or Up In the Air)",7,2,7,7 March 2010
The Illusionist," Norton, Giamatti, Sewell make a tense story
","Pretty damm good movie. Impressive how this movie mixes drama, magic, revenge and love. Kind of like Count of MonteCristo meets a magic show.I really enjoy period movies, especially when they get all the little details and even better when the film feels like it was filmed long ago. Accents are probably not accurate, but they are a minor quibble. Norton is the hero who has loved Beil's character all his life. Sewell is the man who has her. Giamatti does not disappoint in this movie where he plays the inspector trying to expose Norton.Tricks are cool, story is solid yet not too predictable. Certainly worth watching.",9,0,0,23 March 2010
Children of Men," Premise was cool...average plot line slows to a crawl
","I saw this movie after it was nominated for a Academy award.The premise of the story is cool...somehow mankind can no longer reproduce. In other words women can no longer become pregnant. As a sub-plot there is this anti-immigrant story where country of England is shipping out all non-British people, maybe this is the reason this movie has resonated with so many people.Somehow Clive Owen's character gets caught up in helping a pregnant girl escape to some save haven. Obviously her baby is special, but because she is a immigrant, the government is after her.The movie does a poor job of clearing up the who's after her for what reasons. The ending is fairly meaningless. I guess it is some king of warning for 'developed nations' where citizens are having fewer children while immigrants (legal and non-legal) are multiplying 3 times faster.Wait for it to come out on Sci Fi for free or rent it for a dollar.",7,11,16,23 March 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Beautiful Femme Fatal with a Sword,,,can't beat that
","Another top 10 movie, another Quentin Tarantino movie, another movie with samurai swords.Tarantino was said to have created this story with Uma Thurman in mind and she fit perfectly. She did a great job as the Femme Fatal in search of Revenge. This movie certainly has more fight scenes than dialog and they are very well done.This movie pays homage to great Samurai Sagas, 70s Kung Fu movies and one of my favorite scenes which was a wonderful example of Japanese action anime.And again Good guy / Bad guy movies are only great when the Bad guys are well done. And all the bad guys in this movie are so good it is almost a shame to see them demise. In fact Michael Madsen is afraid he will only keep getting bad guy parts. This movie also brought David Carradine back from obscurity.This is one of my top 10 movies and should be higher on the all time list. Kill bill 2 is also very good, but not as good as 1.",10,0,2,17 August 2006
Clash of the Titans," Makes you MISS stop motion filming
","When it comes to classic stories it is dangerous to stray from the storyline, after all they became classics because of the way they were written the first time. If you do stray from the storyyou better do it damn well (such as 300)or fail miserably (such as The Scarlet Letter – Demi Moore version).There have been a handful of versions for the trials of Perseus, but nothing this off target. The only parts of the story that retained are the Graeae and Perseus killing Medusa. The movie came in below 2 hours with big chunks being the freshly made up stuff. So it is quite lean on storyline.The action scenes are OK, but not really impressive. On top of thatthe CGI did not impress me. I found myself missing the Ray Harryhousen stop motion work in 80s version of Clash of the Titans.The acting was OK, but nothing memorable or worth remembering. Ohh one rant, I am getting really tired of the whole 'ancient world spoke English with a British accent', ohh we can't find enough actors that speak with a Mediterranean accentso Queen's English shall suffice. Movie is worth a discount ticketor rent the 1981 Clash of the Titans and watch it at home.",5,4,7,9 April 2010
Black Snake Moan," Black side of love and good side of Blues
","This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect. Music is outstanding the writing is powerful and acting from everyone was brilliant.And the DVD has some great features, including Samuel Jackson's background of learning to play guitar and feel the blues.This movie is not for children and I even caution parents of teenagers.",9,1,4,29 July 2007
The Dark Knight," Heath Ledger stole this movie
","This was a good movie...but not great. First of all I enjoyed the Joker bad guy persona so much that I was almost rooting for him at the end. Heath Ledger just consumed this part so well that I did not even recognize him, every part facial, body language and of course the smiling bad guy curl in his voice.But I found myself saying 'what the hell' in several parts of the film. Like how did Batman not hear of the Joker before he dropped in the party. And how is a guy with a knife and handgun manage to have the ability to get away from Batman so many times. But what really did it for me was...why did Batman let the joker live at the end!!! Come on this is supposed to be the newer meaner batman...and did he not get the memo...the Joker can't come back next movie.Batman did not seem to have as many awesome toys in this movie...and his car did not hold up very well against the bad guys. And to be honest...the movie started to drag...I mean it was almost 3 Hours long.",7,2,5,17 January 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," A movie that is more than a movie
","Chances are that if you are reading this you have already watched 2001: A Space Odyssey. I saw this movie in the theater for its 20yr anniversary, the film had been restored, the sound was modernized (for 1988) and 20min of footage was added back. Before that I had only seen it on PBS.If you have not seen this movie, understand that Kubrick does not follow the same movie formula. Along with his wonderful use of lighting, camera positioning, colors and script modifications; Kubrick will also test your time patience and your tolerance for understanding.So for those of you who have not seen this movie, rent the 148min version, watch it on a big beautiful TV and keep the remote handy. There will be portions where you will want to fast forward scenes at 2x or 4x. There is also a thing called a Intermission (for you youngsters this is for back in the day when the reels of film only fit a certain amount of time so they used 2 reels). You can use this time to make a sandwich or go the restroom. Here is a tidbit...Kubrick only has critical scenes when people are in them. Pause and FFWD at will if it keeps you watching, go ahead.The theater had its die hard fans, who knew it was safe to go get popcorn or go to the bathroom at certain points. And it had some people with short-modern-attention spans who left the theater after 1 hour.I loved this movie. In a non religious way, Kubrick shows you the evolution of man with god. And takes a good attempt at what death/afterlife might look like. But bear in mind this movie was made in 1968, so for its time these special effects were so outstanding you did not mind watching them for 10 or 20 extra minutes.No it is not perfect, I wish some scenes were shorter, I wish there was more explanation about the moon monolith and I wish some scenes moved faster. But like any masterworks...you must accept the artist work as a whole, in other words take the good with the bad.Worth Renting...if you like it...then Buy it.",9,1,3,4 March 2010
Toy Story," One of the greatest family movies EVER!
","My kids are now 10 and 8, they have been watching this movie since they were able to sit up. They still watch it, and I still watch it with them. This is a movie like Dumbo, Snow White and Monsters Inc that you will keep forever.The idea of toys being alive and having the simple desire to be played with. The story is excellent and filled with humor for both kids and adults. The art and sound of the movie are absolutely top notch.My favorite part of the movie, does not even happen in the movie, it happens when your kids go to play in their room. This movie TEACHES kids how to play with toys again. Sadly due to nintendos, computers and other electronic gadgets, kids no longer know how to pretend or use their imagination. The pure brilliant fun of making a house out of a cardboard box, parachute out of a grocery bag and using your imagination to make a story. I saw my daughters taping pieces of cardboard together and creating a story with her ponies and plastic dogs. It brought a tear to my eye.I hope to one day watch this movie with my grand kids, and play after.One of the greatest movies ever.",10,0,0,20 June 2010
Taken," Stay away from Paris
","Okay this is a hamburger movie...by that I mean you go and order a double cheeseburger with bacon...you know what you are going to get...a cheeseburger with bacon.I am kind of happy that they did this kind of movie...not a ransom movie that has been done many times. This movie takes a more honest and depressing theme that girls are being taken for the sex trade. So it makes you feel good when Liam goes around killing bad guys. The story moves at a nice pace, does not have any yeah right scenes and has plenty of gunfire. Any movie where they kill French people gets my vote...and in this there is a bonus they kill arabs. Wohho Moral of the story...stay away from Paris...in fact stay out of France. Worth a matinée price.",8,0,1,23 August 2009
Avatar," Wow
","This movie is the kind that reminds you why you go to the movies. If you have to stand in line to buy 3D tickets, it is worth it. If you can find a IMAX theater within driving distance...make a day trip out of it.The digital details of this movie has set a new standard for digital picture. Add to that that they did it in 3D !!! Ohh and it is not just a handful of shots in 3D...Just about every scene has 3D...in fact it is like you are watching the live movie being made, you truly feel immersed in the movie.The story is very good, best summed up as Dances with wolves meets Starship Troopers. There is very good acting, with some distinguished voices like Sigourney Weaver, Wes Studi and CCH Pounder. I like that James Cameron filled most of the rolls with lesser known actors, so you can focus on the story.There are Mechwarriors in the movie that are some of the best I have ever seen. Awesome.The only minor quips I have are that the movie is long, which can become taxing on the eyes in 3D mode. Almost wished it was in 2 movies. In my opinion this will be the first movie truly deserving of Blue Ray.",9,0,3,11 February 2010
Groundhog Day," My all time favorite Bill Murray movie
","When I first saw this movie in the theater, it just made me laugh. Bill Murray is his regular smart mouth slightly obnoxious self...and he is brilliant at it. If you have not yet seen this movie you owe it to yourself to watch it. Harold Ramis could have just written this about any day, but by centering it around Ground Hog Day Feb 2 he has ensured we all get to watch this great movie every year on some cable channel.While humorous this movie has a serious side of a man who is stuck in a endless loop (dilema or opportunity...you decide) tries to find a purpose and cause to better himself.After you watch this movie, you can't help but think what would you do in this situation.",Null,0,1,5 August 2011
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino...started with a BANG !
","I was like wow...this is different. I am glad Tarantino made this movie for 2 reasons. One he had the courage to make something that was different from what everyone else was doing. Second...if you did not catch this movie on the big screen...you had time to see it and knew NOT to miss his next movie in the big screen.This movie had so many great things about it, too long to list. But safe to say I truly enjoyed the characters and the storyline. Looking back now this movie served as a jump-start or acceleration of actors careers, like Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen and of course Harvey Keitel.The birth of the Tarantino-isms: 1. Bad guys talk with eloquence and intelligence about subject matter that would require recreational reading. 2. No story should ever be told in chronological order. 3. At every point possible inject pop culture and subtle homages to greats in the film history. 4. Curse words are a colorful part of the English language and should be utilized in a manner that elevates them from mere offenses. 5. If a character can be killed...well why not.I was lucky enough to see this movie on the big screen. A solid movie that is worth re-watching. Only points off are for missing some of the fine tuning in later films and higher budget.",8,0,0,26 August 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," Good family movie, could have been better.
","Not bad for a family movie. Nerdy kid Hiccup finds a injured dragon, turns him into a pet and friend. The nerdy kid is the son of a Viking village leader, voiced by Gerard Butler, who is learning how to fight dragons. On his off time he helping the dragon fly again and learning good things about his new pet dragon. Story was good but not great. It was missing the little side jokes and pop culture that is usually in kids movies now days. The voice acting was good with some new namesbut it mostly feels like a long Saturday morning cartoon, it is only about hour and half. The graphics were a little on the cheap side and the soundtrack felt low budget also.My 8yr old liked it but my 10yr old found it OK. It is still a solid movie for family fun. My rating is based on the RE-watch-ability factor. Like the movie Robots, Space Chimps or Meet the Robinsonsyou know good but not great.Worth watching at a discount theater or buy it used.",8,1,2,20 June 2010
Pulp Fiction," One of the greatest guy movies of all time
","Guy movies do not get much better than this. It has good acting, good action and some of the best catch lines ever.Tarantino has made himself and all those who star in this movie immortal. This movie is not child or young teen appropriate. Lots of blood, lots of shooting, lots of bad words, sexual violence and drug use.But the lines and characters in this movie are so memorable that you like many others will be caught memorizing them and repeating them to your friends. I can not think of any movie that has this many memorable lines.Ezekiel 25-17... and Ohh your gonna blow...",10,2,5,14 September 2006
Mystic River," Slow drama with a non sensible ending
","I truly respect Clint Eastwoods work as an Actor and a Director. But mystic river was not one of his better films.The plot moves back and forth between the search for the young girls killers and the flashbacks of Dave's abuse. Eventually they seek revenge on Dave for killing the little girl when in actuality he did not do it.The story moves so slowly and actors performances are over-dramatized. It got to the point every time they zoomed in on Penn or Robbins there was a 5 second pause, gets VERY irritating after the 20th time.I do not know if this is based on a true story or what. But the ending makes no sense...the wife of Robbins knows her husband was a scapegoat and somehow is social with the mother of the girl??? Huh.It was not worth watching again...good but not great...and certainly does NOT deserve to be in top 250 of all time.Changeling and Flags of our fathers are much better examples of Eastwoods directing.",6,0,2,8 July 2009
Zombieland," Quest for a TWINKIE
","You know it is really great to go to a movie and truly have fun and feel you got your money's worth. ZOMBIELAND was awesome !!! Killing zombies is cool, really cool when it is done by a perfect collection of social misfits. Do not show up late for this movie or you will miss out on one of the coolest intro I have seen in a long time. Lots of cool clips of zombies in slow motion while letters from credits fall out of the way, simple yet brilliant.I don't know what it is about apocalyptic movies where only a few humans are left standingI mean sure it would be difficult and dangerous but for some reason the idea of having the world as your playground seems almost like a dream. But I love the concept that 4 of the survivors are on extremes of the social pool.You of course have you gun-toting crazy redneck, probably the only part of society that learns how to use a gun by the time they can walk, played perfectly by Woody Harrelson. The NERD, yep that's right there is always going to be a nerd population that uses its wits and logic to survive, and this one is a sarcastic yet polite person who has developed rules and methods to survive. Jesse Eisenberg pretty much continued the same Adventure land character into the same park just full of zombies. Then you have your con-artist hot girl Emma Stone who has one of the most gorgeous set of eyes I have ever seen, ohh and the rest of her is hot too. And of course there is always the young kid that just finds a way to survive; Abigail Breslin does a great job of delivering in a minimal role.The writers (Rhett Reese + Paul Wernick) and director Ruben Fleischer are young by movie industry standards, did not follow a formula and HIT this movie out of the park. They did not need to rely on stupid formula scare tricks; like 'quick zoom camera' or 'loud noise before the attack' or the one I hate the most the 'turn around look behind you'. And the movie has Bill Murray in itwhat's not to love there! The only complaint I have about this movie is it should have been longer, to show more zombie whacking or running in to a few more survivors.",10,2,4,12 October 2009
The Departed," Brilliant
","Fantastic movie. The story was solid, actors nailed their parts and the development was entertaining.This is basically a Irish Mafia Vs Cops movie. What is not to like. As with most of Scorsese's movies the storyline is bulletproof. I am really enjoying seeing DeCaprio turn in to a serious actor. He is doing all he can to shake the Titanic image. The real surprise for me was Mark Wahlberg he just turned on the Mass' accent and attitude and in my opinion out-shined everyone including the 3 lead actors.The only negative of this movie is it runs a little too long. But still well worth watching again.I was happy to see Scorsese win for best Director it has been a long time coming. He could have easily won for a number of his previous movies like Aviator, Gangs of New York, Casino and one of my all time favorites Goodfellas.This movie is worth buying.",9,0,2,12 May 2009
Glory Road," Fantastic sports movie about a monumental event
","This is certainly one of the greatest sports movies ever made. The only thing more phenomenal is that it is completely true. Yes they modified the story a little for drama purposes. The movie is well acted and the story line is smooth and entertaining. But this is one of those movies that is dominated by the story line which had a monumental impact in college and pro sports.This movie chronicles the story of the School, Coach and Team that contained the first All Black starting lineup to win a NCAA championship. It is also the first championship team to contain a Mexican American. This event that showed change and opportunities for Black athletes in college and pro sports.But to me the most meaningfull part of this story was the environment that allowed this team to prosper. The University, the Coach, supporters and the city all worked to make this possible. Texas Western College of Mines (now known as University of Texas at El Paso) had Black players on its team before Don Haskins arrived. Don Haskins was receptive and recurited more of them. The University is located in a city with friendly and diverse people, being poor and being a minority did not matter so much.It is also a story of David and Goliath, Texas Western was a small school by population and money. It built its program over 5 years before it soundly defeated Kentucky in the NCAA championship. In fact when they won they had a 27 and 1 record. The movie had a bit more negativity than I would have liked, they never really indicated how much the University and city embraced this team and still does. The movie could have shown more teamwork and positive impact that white and Hispanic players made to that championship year. The movie also failed to mention that Texas Western made it to the NCAA tournament in 63 and 64. The movie not really show how much Haskins cared about all his players, and failed to mention that he played basketball as a boy with black friends.The DVD also contains some great extras like interviews with players of that team and inverviews with the coach and his wife.Of course I am a Proud graduate of UTEP...Go Miners.",10,0,0,6 December 2006
Die Hard," A guy movie that is still fun to watch
","So many things made this movie great.This movie made Bruce Willis immortal. He soaks up this character so well, it was him. The wise cracking cop who is entertaining because he is sarcastically funny not uttering stupid catch phrases. He is a cop who looks like a normal guy, middle age, loosing some hair with wife problems. (no faked up pretty face with shaved chest and oiled muscles). He is cool without pretending to be cool. He manages to thwart the bad guys while barefoot, man that is a great twist.The plot is great because it does not fall perfectly in line for the hero. He stumbles, gets stuck and survives only by last minute thinking. It has plenty of action without getting ridiculous.And the bad guys are great, smart sinister and well acted.It is one of those movies that could play every weekend and would still be watched. Is one of those top 10 movies every guy should own.Die hard 2 was OK but not as good as the original, I wish they would have stopped after 2. Die Hard 3 is poor.",10,119,201,17 August 2006
Crazy Heart," Better than I expected...washed out western singer finds purpose
","Pretty impressive movie, storyline was great and it had a meaningful plot. Story of a washed up old western signer/song writer builds himself back up. The movie is not recommended for under 18, due to sex, alcohol and language (unless you want to warn your teenager of drinking and life as a musician).The story is quite simple, but I do not want to give too much away. All the actors did a great job of being natural and Jeff bridges enveloped his part as aging country western singer. I was impressed they got some serious actors for relatively small parts, Robert Duvall, Colin Farrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal. They have enough western music to please most CW fans but not too much to turn non CW fans off. But you could pretty much substitute any musician, Jazz, Blues, Rockand the story would fit.Way better than I expected, I can see why it received Oscar nominations.",8,1,1,6 August 2010
There Will Be Blood," how do these movies win Oscars!!
",Okay this was a selective adaptation of Upton Sinclar book 'Oil'. It had some of the same characters...but did not capture the malicious identity of the early 1900s oil men. Is it entertaining...not really. Did i say wow acting job of a lifetime...not really. Would I watch it again...not really. I thought the movie would be more about the way Oil mongers affected the communities they invaded...but saw almost nothing.Daniel Day Lewis was mean and engulfed his character...but Best actor winner...I think not. I think they are trying to pay him for the job he did in 'Gangs of New York' Wow he was great in that.I did enjoy the almost black and white filming of this movie but found it lacking in substance. Ohh and a little beef here...how did this movie win best cinematography while 'I am legend' and '300' did not even get nominated.,4,2,6,17 January 2009
WALL·E," Fun Family movie for all ages
","This movie is one of the best modern family movies I have ever seen. It can be appreciated by people of all ages. My 5 year old daughter loved it and my 80 year old parents enjoyed it.I do not want to give too much away but it is a combination of sci fi, adventure and innocent love. Yes it pokes into the belief that Walmart will take over the world and we will end up destroying our planets resources and fill it up with trash.What I loved about it was Disney and Pixar's ability to give a animated robot a lovable personality.In addition the two shorts on the disc 'Presto' and 'Burn-e' are also brilliant.This movie is worth buying.",9,0,1,22 February 2010

","A homeless black teenager, Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) has drifted in and out of the school system for years. Then Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and her husband, Sean (Tim McGraw), take him in, transforming Michael's life and theirs. With help from his new-found family, tutors and coaches, he realizes his potential as a student and football playerThese movies are rare and beautiful. This is one of the best examples of what the kindness of the human spirit can do when it helps another person. What makes this movie that much more special is that it is a true story. This story will make you appreciate the things that really matter in life, people who love you, health and simple necessities. This movie has Oscar potential written all over it. Screenplay and directing are top notch. The casting is outstanding, down to the small characters. Sandra Bullock is at her prime and Quinton Aaron did a brilliant job delivering a struggling young man. If this movie does not win multiple Oscars I will never watch the Oscars again.This is a movie to take the whole family. It is entertaining and makes you feel good.

The Silence of the Lambs," helloo clarice
","This movie was groundbreaking. It finally gave a showcase role for one of the greatest actors of all time, Sir Anthony Hopkins. It also revived the career of Jodie Foster.Hopkins character dominated and clearly the character was well written and had some of the most memorable lines of all time.The movie keeps you wondering what will happen next during the whole movie and in the back of your mind you know there is a strange relationship based on interest between Hopkins character and Foster's character.This is one of those movie where you almost create a respect and admiration for Hopkin's character.",10,2,4,8 September 2007
Iron Man," A superhero for the mechanical NERDS!!
","Whoo yeah one of my favorite superheros come to life. This movie was a fantastic adaptation of the comic book series. The story was well done and moved along with smooth pace. Plenty of great action scenes that showed many levels of the suits powers. And I have to say Robert Downey Jr. was perfect for the part almost a alter ego of himself. Jeff Bridges was a evil bad guy. Gwyneth Paltrow looked good as Pepper Potts. One of the best things about this was that they built a real suit it was not all CGI like Hulk. You have to really respect that they built real suits for the special effects. Okay the real Iron man was created during the Vientam war and had multiple suits for different applications...but the concept was the same, bad guys say build me a weapon...so he does but not for them.Whoo I hope they make 4 of these!!Saw it twice in the theater and bought the DVD. Hey this may even inspire a whole new generation of robotic engineers.",9,0,1,17 January 2009
Toy Story 3," Funny Heartwarming Family Fun...Outstanding!!
","Just as good as the first two. Outstanding family movie, funny for kids with bits that adults will love. It is amazing how Pixar/Disney finds new way to keep the story fresh. It has been 15 years since the first Toy Story, and they found a way to work that into the movie.We saw it in 3Dthe 3D did not add many items flying at your face. So save some money watch the regular version, in fact avoid the 3D glasses eye strain. I do not want to give anything away, but I have to point out some of my favorite parts. The part of Andy growing up and outgrowing his toys, reminds me of my own kids who are growing up and loosing their childhood ways. And the 'Buzz Lightyear Spanish mode' was brilliant. And the extra music done by the Gypsy Kings was fantastic.It is amazing how many great actors lend their voices to these movies, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Joan Cusak, Michael Keaton, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenburger and others. Ned Beatty did a brilliant job of voice acting for Lotso, he reminded me of Phil Harris (Baloo, Jungle book). Blake Clark did a great job on Slinky Dog paying homage to the late Jim Varney. Worth watching in the theater with family, and definitely worth buying.",10,2,4,20 June 2010
RED," Funny, clever action movie with excellent actors
","Ohh yeah this was good fun. Take a action adventure, comedy, conspiracy and sprinkle top tier actors with a brilliant scripta classic in the making. Bruce Willis pulled a 'Whole 9 yards' performance, ML Parker looked as good as she does on Weeds, John Malkovich is always a standout, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox and even Ernest Borgnine all had parts that blended yet still allowed their screen personalities to shine through. I love how the aging actor reflects into the aging assassinwell done. The story has plenty of violence to please the action fans, lets say safe for 13 and older. There are many things I liked about this movie, but the stand out is the visual and audio special effects, they were great without being too 'aww come on' as done in many over the top movies. This is a movie I will definitely add to my collection.",9,1,2,18 November 2010
300," Battle dance in blood
","The battle scenes are visually stunning. The adaptation of Frank Miller's book is faithful to what matters...the gory graphic violence.If you are a person that loves to see limbs dislocate while their victim screams in agony. If you enjoy blood cascading like rain drops on a battlefield. The beauty of heads dislodging while they still have a expression on their face. This movie IS FOR YOU ! And my favorite part is blades traveling in slow motion to capture the graceful destruction of their victim. Man I just kept watching in anticipation of new characters just to see them die.The only part that Frank Miller claims to be historical is the 300 Spartans that fought to the death against the Persians. So if you are going for Oscar winning performances, perfect subplots or a history lesson...this is the wrong movie for you. The only have 2 complaints: 1 I wish there were less scenes filmed in near darkness or night, makes it difficult to watch on normal TVs and hard to appreciate the cinematography. 2 They should have spent more time with the battle scenes and less with goofy drama going on in the senate.Worth owning used.",8,0,2,29 July 2007
Sin City," Action film that looks like art
","So few movies can adapt from comic to screen. But when they are done this well it is like watching art. Frank Miller wrote some great stories and Robert Rodriguez transfered them beautifully to the screen.This is NOT a movie for kids or family time, very violent, bad language, sexuality and some creepy parts (you have to watch to find out).A great collection of short stories with Tough guys, beautiful girls and lots of blood, fists, bullets and my favorite a Samurai sword. Some of the script reads as poetic taoism. The good guys are against the world and unappreciated, while only being good to seek revenge on those who wronged them.Every actor brought their A-game. Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood were my favorites. I loved the actors who went from being safe happy 'after school special' characters to walking on the wild side like Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl, Rosario Dawson, Alexis Bledel and the luscious Carla Gugino.This movie has the greatness of Pulp Fiction with the visual stunning of The Crow.",10,0,1,17 August 2006
The Ugly Truth," A chick movie  that guys will like
","I am sure a lot of guys got dragged to this movie by their girlfriends. (well OK me too) Well in fact the theaters pretty much had nothing but couples. I am telling you guysif your girlfriend, wife, mistress or best friends hot mom wants to watch this with yousay YES.This is one of those rare chick flicks that are more fun for guys to watch. Katherine Heigl is in this movie, so most chicks thought this would be like some 2 hour Grays Anatomy episode. NOT About 15min into it the dudes are laughing out loud and the chicks are feeling embarrassed but still laughing, but since the movie was the chick's idea they go along with it.But once Gerard Butler started spouting of the one liners, and telling women that if they really want men to stick around they need to be slutty and not complain about how their men dress. Butler's character continues to makeover Heigl's character so she can get the guy of her carefully calculated dreams.Of course the typical romantic comedy formula takes over and Heigl and Butler eventually start falling for each other. Plenty of naught talk but no complimentary frontal nudity (sorry guys). Heigl is fun to look at but when is she gonna start showing off the twins!!Worth renting, you may even get naught sex after.",7,1,5,21 November 2009
Moon," Sci Fi Drama, Rockwell was brilliant
","This is a Sci-Fi Drama...yes they exist. Many of the good Sci-Fi movies have a element of drama, to make you identify with the character. This movie engulfs you in the life of a single person living/working on the moon. The only real company he has is the main computer called GERTY. The movie has resonances of Space Oddessey 2001 combined with a twilight zone episode. Every time I hear a computer voice say 'I'm sorry' I feel the chill through my spine from 'I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that' that HAL utters in 2001, to this day one of the all time bad guys. I have liked watching Sam Rockwell in his many roles, and I give him props for this movie. Rockwell basically is doing a one man show and must transform emotionally and physically during the movie. He deserves an Oscar for this performance. Sadly most people now days do not have the patience or appreciation for one man dramas. The movie is a reasonable 90 something minutes but because of the small cast feels longer. I will say the story could have moved a little bit quicker. I thought the set production and cinematography were outstanding making you think he was in a large space station and traveling on the moon surface. Worth Renting just make sure you are not expecting lots of explosions or lasers.",8,1,4,4 March 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," Not bad...but
","This movie was OK. I rented it and sat down with my wife to watch it. The story is very depressing for 90% of it, shows a lot of poverty and cruelty of living poor in India. The story basically centers around Jamal who some strange way gets on the show Who want's to be a millionaire in India. Quickly goes into some strange interrogation where he starts to tell the story of love, happiness, tragedy and some joy. The movie benefited by not having the dance scenes and song scenes in the middle of the movie (as most typical Bollywood movies). Yeah Hollywood gave a lot of Oscars to this movie. I think it was in hope of 'making happy a new market' close to Bill people. The story was OK but not solid enough to be in the Best Screenplay category (Frost Nixon was still better). Got Oscar for sound and music (Walle should have won both). Just my opinion but this movie does not deserve to be in top 250 of all time.I still enjoyed Monsoon Wedding much more as a example of good India film-making.",7,0,6,28 September 2009
Donnie Darko," Jake Gyllenhaal best work
","This is a fantastic film, to me it is Jake Gyllenhaal finest work to date. It is full of small but good acting performances by Drew Barrymore, Noah Wylie and even Jake's sister Maggie Gyllenhaal.This movie has the surreal look of Jacobs Ladder with the time / dimension warp element of Steven Hawking. The story line is solid and logical yet it throws you curves. You may try and guess the ending but it keeps you wondering until the end.It is not super scary but has enough to spook you if you watch it late at night. The dialog of this film is brilliant, actors lines are intelligent and articulate and are delivered with intensity.I am afraid of bunnies now.",9,1,3,12 September 2006
V for Vendetta," Angry guy in a mask
","This movie was so slow for me that I fell asleep during the movie. No joke. And when I woke up I picked up just where I dozed off and knew I missed nothing.The movie started good had kind of a 'Darkman' quality to it. Then became like some sort of cross between Ryming Batman and Phantom of the opera.I like the premise that V represents the one day revenge of the masses for those Totalitarian people who if left un-checked will drive humanity in two lives of fear and oppression. I only felt it was wasted since it seemed to concentrate on political exiles and gays and lesbians, as if they are the only ones discriminated against.The story goes back and forth in time and sideways to plots of other people to try and explain the drive.I am sure this movie was/is loved by many 'alternative lifestyle' people who feel they need a champion movie. But it has only proved how lame of a movie it is by its dismal showing at the box office. This movie certainly does not deserve to be in the top 250 of all time, I think once people actually watch it they will see how lame it is.Do yourself a favor rent Sin City, Dark City, The Crow or even 12 Monkeys. Any of those has the same feel but a far superior film.Scenes of London were good though, and it is nice to see Natalie Portman.",1,2,9,17 August 2006
