The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Best movie yet, and most true to the story line of the book.
","**********SPOILER ALERT***********I have been anxious to see this movie since the debut of Eclipse. I wanted to know how a book as amazing as Breaking Dawn with the craziness of a vampire to human marriage resulting in a 1/2 human 1/2 vampire child would play out.The wedding is beautiful, the gown is beautiful, the groom is glowing he is so proud. Kristen does an amazing job of presenting a nervous bride who is suddenly sure of marrying her soul mate when she sees him standing at the end of the aisle.The honeymoon is wonderful. I was amazed at the details and how true to the book this part was. It's not explicit, they are under covers for the majority of it and no frontal nudity. Would love to see the uncut version - maybe on DVD. They are happy and so in love. Edward is busy trying to distract Bella and keep her mind off sex after their first foray...she is busy trying to seduce her all-to-willing husband and finally wins. It was presented very true to the book and while some parts were skipped, the important ones were there. The morning after will make you laugh :) Once they realize she is pregnant we are swept into the intense portion of the movie.Jacob's portion of the book could have used more attention, but since I have read the book many times I was not lost. I went with a friend who has not read any of the books and she was confused about a few things. Namely the imprinting and what the heck was going on at the lumber yard when the pack is arguing in their wolf form. The problem for the younger crowd, and why my 11-year-old will need to wait for the DVD is the graphic nature of the birth scene. I am not complaining, because once again the movie is so true to the book. The baby is delivered via vampire teeth c-section. I also appreciated the description of the burning that Bella experiences through the depiction of the venom traveling through Bella's body.Speaking of her body, Bella is very emaciated - think poster child for anorexia. There are many shots of her emaciated body - mostly clothed, but still pretty graphic. She then dies after the baby is delivered and with the special effects it's pretty convincing that Edward and Jacob are working on a corpse. Condon adds a vampire vs. werewolf fight for viewing pleasure, but really the book touches on this after Bella wakes up. It's a bit different, but I understand why it was made this way. Jacob saves the day and we are left on the edge of our seats waiting for the next installment. I was not disappointed - hope you enjoy it too! 10/10 Stars",10,9,24,18 November 2011
