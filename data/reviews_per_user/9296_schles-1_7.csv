Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," if you're in the 'right' mood
","Off the wall,in bad taste, politically in-correct...all these things and much more can be used to describe Borat. While it won't appeal to everyone, there is no denying the creativity, audacity, and near anarchic zaniness of Cohen's latest film. Maybe 'comic genius' is a bit of an exaggeration, however there is no question that this is a great and very original talent. A must see...even if not totally enjoyed,any semi-serious film buff will find his/her time and money well spent.The fact that Cohen is not himself an American adds a nice touch to the 'outsider's' look at U.S. culture and society. Besides the rather extreme and outlandish humor, it is the choices of who and what to meet in America that make this a film that has more than entertainment value. It does, believe it or not, provide plenty of food for thought. That adds up to a much higher than average night at the movies.",9,1,5,14 December 2006
Two for the Money," got to make a living
","For all the cast and crew who worked on this excuse for a movie, another payday in L.A. For any audience hoping for a fair return for the price of admission, a huge waste of time and money. The saddest aspect of this ugly exercise (to me) is that we are watching an extremely talented actor, Pacino, seemingly playing a parody of himself. That's what remained with me as a total mystery. I can fully understand the need for movie industry people to work and thus make a living. What I fail to comprehend is an artist of Al Pacino's talent prostituting and embarrassing himself with this level of mindless junk. Hopefully he'll choose projects of better value in the future...and for value, save your time and hard earned money. Skip this!! Let's send Hollywood and Al a message.",1,0,2,24 January 2006
BlacKkKlansman," American History 101
","Thank you, Spike Lee. Your film should be required viewing for ages 0 to 100 and not just by Americans. From Birth of a Nation to Harry Belafonte's unforgettable story, from the very real David Duke to the all too real Donald Trump, from yesterday to today, you have given us a vision that must be studied in order for tomorrow to be any better. And that vision has to do with not only your identity as a Black director but also your identity as a human being and true artist.
' If not now, when'? This challenge (from a Jewish source) is what elevates your film to rise above an entertainment and achieve the status of art. One leaves the theater, enters the real world and can only be moved to a altered perception by the viewing experience. Any American history teacher on the planet should urge his/her students to open their eyes, ears, minds and hearts and learn from your masterpiece. Thank you.",10,33,85,13 August 2018
Batman Begins," pure junk
","A waste of time, money, and talent. This film is a comic book at its lowest,worst, most obscene level. Ridiculously violent,visually unpleasant,unbearably loud,poorly plotted,and embarrassingly acted. If there has been any movie to come out recently that is worth walking out of, this is it. It's noteworthy for that alone. The one question it did raise, however, is this: is it really possible that with all the creative talent that exists in the industry that makes films,the re-cycling of previous blockbusters is what warrants the resources and energy that were so obviously spent on this? It will make a fortune for its producers and many of its participants but it is not worth the price of a ticket and is truly offensive to adults and destructive to children.",1,7,22,5 July 2005
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," in a normal movie ...
",But this is not a normal movie. So Julia Butters can't steal the show. Incredibly though she adds a beautiful piece to the puzzle that Tarantino delivers. And what a great puzzle it is. Anyone who loves film will be sorry to see it end and busy anticipating seeing it again (and maybe again). LA of 1969 as well as TV and the movies from that time couldn't have been better presented but more than that there is enough relevancy to today to prevent a mere trip down memory lane. 'Food for thought' would be the understatement of the year. A precious gem of a film.,9,7,19,14 August 2019
The Good Shepherd," Love/Hate
","Anyone reading the comments who has not seen this film must feel awe struck by the opposite extremes of reaction created by those reacting to having apparently viewed the same film. From this: 'The more I think about this movie, the more interesting it becomes...I may see it again'. To someone comparing the viewing experience to a torture method appropriate to a North Korean POW camp (got to love that imagery). I find the rather emotional, even somewhat distraught negative reactions fascinating and a little scary. This forum allows for a truly democratic form of movie criticism, which is fine...as is the democratic rating system. And when a potential movie goer or renter decides how to spend their time and money, this can be helpful or hurtful in making choices. Who are the critics? Just folks who like the idea...like me for instance. Should we follow their advise? Not necessarily!!!",10,4,8,24 March 2007
Munich," is comment 536 worth anything?
","As an ex-American living in Israel for the past 34 years, I would like to add my personal perspective to Munich. By my standards, it's a good film in that it is not only well made technically, but very thought provoking and engaging on an emotional level. I was not bothered by the fact that it took many liberties with historical fact, since it makes no claim to be a documentary. However, two major flaws caused me a certain level of discomfort. Why portray the Israel Mossad team as mostly non-Israel and extremely amateurish? Since this was so obviously and extremely far fetched, was there a some artistic point and if so what? Secondly and far more disturbing, why was revenge or punishment of the terrorists the only and constant driving motivation given for Israel's response,when the known and obvious factor of self-defense in an on-going war for survival was and still is the operative element in trying to prevent more terror from those who have declared their intentions openly and publicly. When all is said and done, there really are two sides to every conflict. This film may have somehow,and maybe even admirably, attempted to be somewhat even-handed. Maybe that's why others could find more to like in it than either an Israeli or a Palestinean. We, who are still embroiled daily in this on-going, tragic, and complicated conflict need much more than a decent piece of entertainment to help us struggle toward a just and viable solution. So...good movie,yes...but impossible for those who are here, living the reality to really appreciate and find much value in.",7,0,0,26 March 2006
