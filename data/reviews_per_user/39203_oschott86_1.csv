The Devil's Advocate," Incredible movie
","Devils Advocate is my personal favorite. It is wisely directed and the way the actors perform is impressive(except the Asian girl in the elevator). This film is a must, and believe me that you will not regret watching it (except if you are a puritan). After watching this movie you may feel a little confused about your religious beliefs. It may aid you on doing wrong or it may even help you to be a better person. After watching this movie you may find that you have been doing many things wrong. This movie is intended to leave a message. However, some people take it the other way. This movie will change your perception of good and bad just a little bit. Feel free to reply since your opinion can be different from mine. This is just my opinion and I will not try to change your way of thinking. So fell free to respond positively or negatively.",10,3,4,19 November 2007
