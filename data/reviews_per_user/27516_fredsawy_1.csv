Catch Me If You Can," Catch me if you Can, The Great Impostor
","Catch me if you can is a well made movie, but the main problem I have with it has nothing to do with the movie, but with its promotional ads and reviews. They keep promoting it as an original movie from an original idea never filmed before. So, all I have to say, am I the only one that seems to remember the Tony Curtis 1961 film `The Great Impostor' Which was also based on a true story about a man who goes around pretending to be everything from a Monk to a Prison Guard. He even pretended to be a surgeon and performed surgeries, and got away with them. So again, all I have to say, is am I the only one that remembers that film and if not, why do they keep saying `Catch me if you Can' is an original idea?",Null,0,0,28 December 2002
