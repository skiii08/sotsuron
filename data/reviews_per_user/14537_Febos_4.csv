The Blair Witch Project," Intense and satisfying...
",I think the director of the film (Daniel Myrick) was bold in creating anything but your regular main stream horror film. He not only made you tense and nervous but also made you think. This movie was one of the few horror film that let you decide what's out the there and let your imagination run wild.

A Clockwork Orange," A very good movie
",Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece A Clockwork Orange is a truly great movie. Kubrick's use of constant nudity is a little 'over done' but the plot and meaning of the movie is magnificent He tells the strange story of a young mans journey from a street gang raper to a brainwashed law binding citizen. Or is he? This movie grabs your attention and want let you go. I great movie but not for the light hearted.,8,0,0,9 August 1999
