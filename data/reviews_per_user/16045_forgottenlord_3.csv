Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas had more to worry about this time 'round
","When you set your expectations high, you generally get disappointed.The Phantom Menace would have been considered a good movie if people weren't expecting revolutionary special effects as the originals had in their time. Lucas has much more to compete against today than he had to 20-25 years ago.Another issue, the story line.  In just the last quarter of a year, I have seen about 5 new books based in the Star Wars Universe.  Lucas could make whatever he felt like 20 years ago because he was only bound to the movies he'd already made.  Now he has to worry about a universe that is molded more by the books that continue to expand on it than the movies that started. While an average person likely wouldn't care about it, anyone who reads the novels will feel cheated if they didn't get something similar to what they've read about.For someone who had many rules to follow, Lucas did a fabulous job.For someone who wanted to impress an audience with high expectations, Lucas fell short.Better luck this year.",8,0,1,31 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Great Movie
","The only reason I didn't see this movie twice was because I decided that instead, I'd rather have my second, third and fourth viewing of it all on the same day without going broke.  It was a fabulous movie.I compare it to the only other movie that came out this year that I've seen - Harry Potter.  With only a week in between the time I saw each, I felt after Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter was a rip off.My Dad was telling me a few days before I saw it that I should read the book while my friends were saying that a) The book ruined it and b) there were two many omissions.  I didn't hear a word either group said- if Harry Potter gave me anything, it was a lesson, read the book afterwards.  That is what seperated me from my friends.Unfortunately, every rating service in this world has an annoying cap of giving a movie 100% (which translates into 10/10 or 5/5 or whatever). Personally, I have found there are several movies where the mark it deserves is above that limit.  Lord of the Rings is not just one of those movies, but serpasses them all.  If the world was my way, Lord of the Rings would get 35/10.  I don't know, that may be a bit low.Now to find out how badly it mutilated the books - I am going to read them.",10,1,1,30 January 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Problems might even screw up sequels (A FEW SPOILERS HERE)
","The Following text contains spoilers of this movie and sequels Please refrain from reading if you haven't watched the movie If you have but you haven't read the books, don't read past the line of asterics.Hello, I'm a major Harry Potter fan.  I have read all four books (several times) and I have countless discussions and speculations on how the entire series is being played out with my friends.  I love movies but am not an expert on them, but I do enjoy commenting on them.  For this movie, I must congradulate Columbus for not just screwing up this movie, but damaging some of the points that are in the upcoming sequels.  I couldn't stand the movie. most movies make me sit there, give me the odd thing to laugh about - unless I'm watching a comedy where I'm rolling on the ground not able to hear the next line because I'm laughing so hard for a full 2 hours (which is why I don't watch them in the theater) - and keep my focus but as far as I could tell, there was only one humorous sceen that they wasted in the comercials.Before I describe what it dents for the upcoming movies, I'd like to describe what was wrong with its translation from the book.First, and I have had several fights with my mom over this, but I felt that while the Dursleys definitely deserved less screen time than book time, they were cut a bit too short.  You just didn't get the feel of the absolute hatred that the Dursleys felt for Harry, or vice versa.  Of course, my mom would be perfectly all right if they were cut completely (shakes his head).Second, (being a major logic person) I wanted to see Snape's challenge. It was a puzzle I would have somewhat liked to have been mapped out in the book (ie, given us an idea of where each of the bottles were) and was hoping for in the movie.  By far, that was my greatest disappointment.Third, I rather enjoy the remarks and retorts that are tossed around between Draco Malfoy and Harry (and there respective friends).  However, I guess when you're translating something from book to movie, anything unnecessary must be thrown out.  Still, like I said above, there was a considerable lack of humor and the fights Harry and Malfoy have would have made up for it.Fourth, my friends and I have had an ongoing argument on how to pronounce Hermione.  We thought that it was settled in the fourth book when she pronounced it Her - my - oh - nee, whereas in the movie its more like Herm - oh - nee.  This is likely not a major issue to most of the world because that's how the majority of the world pronounces it (or so I understand) but I think that when you are trying to decide between what's normal for the world and what the author decreed, you should go with the author.************************************************************************Now, my comments on the upcoming movies.In the book, after the first of the letters from Hogwarts are recieved (and through all the books afterwards) Harry is moved into Dudley's junk toys bedroom at the beginning of the movie.  On the one hand, it would be a major flaw in movie magic for him to all of a sudden be in a bedroom but on the other, it is a major flaw in translating the books into movies.Also, the Quidditch match was fairly long, so I'm interested to see how they manage to get everything into The Prisoner of Azkaban (#3) and all three Quidditch matches.  (Though I must say, I enjoyed the different spin on the match that was put in there - mainly the viciousness of Flint).I hope they don't strip Lucius Malfoy's two parts.  They are enjoyable better even than (while we're at it, hopefully they don't remove too much of Dobby either - ie. his being freed and his requirement to start smacking himself with the nearest heavy object).",8,0,0,30 January 2002
