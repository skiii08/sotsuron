The Ring," Total Hype
",This movie was OK at best and received a rating of '2' from my wife and I. It is amazing to me how so many people can get caught up into the 'hype' that they actually beleive it. This movie was not scary in any way! Remember the hype of the Blair Witch?? Remember how fast it died and was forgotten? The same will happen here. There is nothing of 'long lasting rememberance' in this movie. Really a total disappointment. This kind of hype must be started by the movie studios in order to sell tickets. There are people that will beleive anything you tell them even after they see first hand otherwise!,2,0,0,3 November 2002
