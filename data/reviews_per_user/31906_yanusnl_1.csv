Angels & Demons," The most awful filming of a book ever!
","This was by far the most awful, nail curling film i have seen in quite a while. I wanted to throw my laptop through the window while watching, I wanted to surgically remove my brains so that I do not have to live with the memory of having watched this film. Saying this, it is obviously is have read the book before i watched the movie. because, there are more than 50 (I counted) things that do not match the book. In fact I think there are more things incorrect than correct according to the book. This is THE perfect example of a film butchered by Hollywood. I wanted to say Ron Howard is the most terrible director mankind has ever known. But I can't. He directed Cindarella Man and A Beautiful Mind, which both are really good movies. But he sure slaughtered and butchered this one. I simply do not believe Ron Howard read Dan Brown's book before making this film, he probably only read a summary on the internet. There are simply too many things wrong with this film to mention every one of them, but I will give it a go. 1. Where is Mr. Phillipe????? 2. Vittoria Vetra did not discover the body of her father 3. In the movie this isn't even her father 4. where is the ultrasonic jet that flew Langdon to Geneva (he didn't even visit Geneva in the film) 5. There are three fighting scenes cut out (the one in the fountain, the one in San Angelo and the one in the 'fire' church where Langdon gets stuck behind the tomb) 6. Robert Langdon did not flew with the Camerlengo in the chopper (of course in the book he did) 7. THE FOURTH CARDINAL WAS NOT MURDERED?!?! 8. Not only that, he is elected for Pope, what the hell is that about? 9. In the book, there were trouble with the number of police men that could be used. While in the movie, the Vatican police, the Carabinieri and even S.W.A.T. teams are all over the place. I think you catch my drift here. It would have been better if Ron Howard simply used another name for the movie, contacted Dan Brown that he used fractions of his book and that's it. This, by far, nowhere near a filming of a book. I am really p*ssed of about the fact that I just gave up 2 hours of my life to watch this worthless piece of junk film, knowing I will never get those two hours back. I even feel bad for Tom Hanks and Ewan McGregor that they starred in this film, because they are both great actors and should not be in a useless film like this. So my tip to you is, if you read the book but didn't watch the movie, DO NOT WATCH IT! If you didn't read the book and didn't watch the movie, you perhaps can watch it, but still I doubt the fact you will give it higher than a 6. This was my review and I hope I will stop people from watching this film by heaving them read this review. Jan M Eindhoven Netherlands",1,6,10,30 May 2011
