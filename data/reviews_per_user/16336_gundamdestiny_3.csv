The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Very Boring
","This movie was both boring and disappointing. Those calling it the 'Best Games yet' are i believe paid. This was not the best games yet, Catching Fire is 10 times better. Total waste of money, there were some good parts but thats not enough for the overall movie. And Jennifer Lawrence's acting was just boring, not enough character in there compared to her Catching Fire Katnis.This film was a total waste of money, and the Part 1 and Part 2 thing, is just a grab for money. This isn't Harry Potter or Twilight, this is terrible just utter crap.Good Day, I'd like a refund",1,28,41,1 December 2014
Suicide Squad," Good start, falls apart later
","Suicide Squad was a film I was not looking forward to after the disaster known as Batman V Superman. As a fan of comics and also as a movie goer, this movie fails on many levels but manages to achieve some things.The Suicide Squad form together to fight Enchantress and her cgi army, they're built up of a bunch of baddies.The start is good but the intros definitely went to long, throughout the story though Will Smith's Deathstroke and Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn are really the main characters, everyone is just supporting i guess. The story becomes quite repetitive and boring after the first half of the film. Once the action starts, a brief break, then back to the action. A formula I don't believe is good enough for a film like this. However this film was more humorous than Batman V Superman, which made it much better in my opinion, I was always excited to see Captain Boomerang as I knew he would always have a joke lined up.Joker Jared Leto's Joker appearance is too short for me to make any sort of judgement but from what I saw he was Okay, not as good as Ledger or Nicholson.This film was better than Batman V Superman mainly because it has more action, and its more light hearted. Will Smith did an alright job, but Margot Robbie really shined as Harley Quinn as she did a very good portrayal of the character.P.S Killer Croc looks so stupid",5,180,358,4 August 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Good Concept, horrible execution
","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was overly hyped and there were too many spoilers in the trailers released before it came out.But you won't need spoilers for you to watch this movie, because this movie is just as bad as the first one. I walked into the cinema thinking this movie was gonna be awesome, but i was wrong, this movie was terrible. I'll admit it had some pretty cool action sequences but that just isn't enough for a movie.The cast in this movie is not the best, the Green Goblin is played by some feminine boy, and Electro played by Jamie Foxxx is not good at all. The transition of scenes are also terrible as they just shift from one scene to another, talking about something new. There's hardly any real build up of the characters as well. The acting isn't bad, but whoever directed it needs more work on his skills, because everything is badly placed. If the next one isn't good please all sign a petition to get 'The Spectacular Spider-Man' cartoon back, because it is 10x better than this movie franchise so far",1,7,36,17 July 2014
