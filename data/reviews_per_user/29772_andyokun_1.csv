It," Loved IT
","This is the first time that I ever posted here on IMDb though I have valued this page for about 8 years now.I need to first start off saying that I never read the book. I never saw the 1990 mini series.Just returned from seeing IT (2017) about 5 minutes ago. I personally loved every minute of IT.I am seeing negative and positive reviews on this here on IMDb and on FB.This movie kept me glued to my seat all the way through. I left the movie just saying 'wow' to myself over and over and over again. I agree that it had more CGI effects than needed. Personally I loved the sound. I think it helped startle the crowd. Everyone in the theater just jumped at all the parts where the surprises came.Don't want to give away or spoil IT. I am not a book reader of any kind. I do however would like to see the 1990 mini series version just to check IT out.I thought the story was held together quite nicely despite some obvious flaws in the filming (which is why I gave it an 8/10).Personally I do not have an issue with clowns. Those that do should probably not see this movie IMHO as you will have some gnarly nightmares.From what I am seeing there are a lot of folks that have experience from reading the book and watching the mini series. I am actually glad that I do not have experience with either. For me it was fresh and had enough gore but not too much gore. I thought that the actors/actresses played their parts well and totally added to the entertainment value of the presentation. Right from the beginning when Georgie was floating the paper boat down the stream and into the gutter I was already hooked (which is in the trailer, so no, not a spoiler). I am totally looking forward to seeing the next part.If you like a good thriller and you have no experience with the book or mini series I can honestly recommend seeing this flick.",8,4,9,17 September 2017
