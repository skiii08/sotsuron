National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Horrific.
","I liked National Treasure enough, but I completely loathed Book of Secrets. It was just loaded with an entirely clichéd story, clichéd characters, wildly predictable situations and probably the most contrived and utterly unbelievable events I've ever seen in a film. I was just in awe the entire time about how ridiculous it was. I was expecting a bit of that coming in to the film (I mean I got past the clichés and contrivances of the first one and found it to be decent entertainment) but it was just way too much this time around. Every second introduced a new painfully ridiculous event that had me cringing in my seat. If it wasn't for Justin Bartha, who I still enjoyed a lot and found hilarious throughout, I probably would have slit my wrists.",2,14,30,8 January 2008
Vertigo," Superb!
","Let me start by saying that the twist is one of the most original, shocking and simply intelligent that I've ever seen on film. I was completely stunned when it was revealed, and I can only think of one or two other occasions of me being shocked remotely by a twist. Hitchcock has a rare ability to have the film run 15 full minutes with no dialogue, yet it remains just as/if not more engaging as any action filled bloodfest we see today. My eyes became completely glued to the screen as I became just as obsessed with discovering the truth behind the mystery as Scottie was. As Lynch does in Blue Velvet, Hitchcock uses the theme of voyeurism throughout yet instead of making it perverse and disgusting he somehow makes the act feel completely natural and almost comfortable; it's just like a second nature.The use of contra-zoom to display the sense of vertigo is absolutely astonishing. It perfectly depicts the sensation and even gives the viewer a sense of the illness whenever the technique is used. The performances are fantastic. Stewart is definitely at the top of his game, bringing us right into the character in what I consider the finest work of his career. Novak is even more incredible, delivering one of my all time favorite portrayals. She is completely immersed into her character and furthers the viewer's immersion into Scottie. We really feel the same emotions as he does throughout the entire picture. The ending is unbelievably abrupt, but that makes it all the more shocking and utterly cathartic.",10,7,10,9 January 2008
The Incredible Hulk," One of the very best of it's kind.
","The Incredible Hulk takes a slightly different approach to the normal routine of a superhero picture. Instead of focusing all the energy and screen time on trying to one-up the competition with the next best CGI sequence and the most explosive, ridiculous fight scenes, it takes a smaller approach and focuses on the characters. And it really works.Edward Norton's performance is easily one of the best in a film of it's nature, as he perfectly displays the internal anguish of a man who can't lose control of his emotions. Early on he encounters a female co-worker (he's living in Brazil at the time, working at a soda-producing factory) being harassed by some other men and you can see in his eyes the heartache that comes with knowing that by getting involved in the situation he'll only make things much worse. His performance goes far beyond what the role calls for and adds another impressive entry to his phenomenal resume. On the other side of the battle is an equally impressive from the always incredible Tim Roth. His Emil Blonsky is a soldier who believes his only reason for living is to fight. He's hitting middle age and realizing that his body is not at all what it used to be, so when he sees this massive green symbol of pure power he sees a new hope. Blonsky wants to the power of the Hulk, and he wants more of it. Roth perfectly captures the greed, obsession and slight desperation of Blonsky and seeing the two of them on opposite sides of a battle is absolutely stunning. William Hurt provides excellent support as the explosive Thunderbolt Ross, a General leading the hunt for Hulk and also father to Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), the love of Banner's life. In fact the only major flaw in the film is Tyler's atrocious performance. She is unconvincing, bland and sticks out like a sore thumb in this epic ensemble.On the surface, it's a chase film. Banner is in Brazil trying to find a cure for his gamma radiation poisoning, when General Ross finds him and the chase begins, ultimately resulting in one of the most adrenaline-fueled scenes in history when the army tries to bring Hulk down outside of the college where Betty works. So the chase aspect provides for absolutely incredible action sequences that had me on the edge of my seat throughout. But deep down, at the film's core is both a story of two lovers trying to be together and, more importantly, a story of a desperate man gaining control of his emotions and the explosive anger radiating inside of him. It makes for something very compelling, well-acted, explosive and well...incredible.",9,4,10,13 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," A whole mess of fun.
","Certainly one of, if not the, best action films of the decade. A wickedly fun ride with some amazing cinematography and gorgeously intense action scenes. Philip Seymour Hoffman delivers another top-notch performance as one of the greatest villains in cinema history. Billy Crudup is perfectly cast. Though their roles are particularly small, Keri Russell and Simon Pegg could not have been cast more perfectly. I absolutely adore Keri Russell as well. She's so cute and sweet, yet she plays a gun-blaring badass with ease. However the film goes a bit over the top sometimes, and I was really desperate to murder Jonathan Rhys Meyers any time he came on screen. His character is so corny and weak with some of the worst lines I've ever heard. I really wanted him dead every time he spoke. And although it's been a decade, I still can't believe Tom Cruise as a badass secret agent. He's much more believable in this one though, I'll be honest. Easily one of the better films of the straight up action genre.",8,8,12,8 January 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," An underrated gem.
","I love it dearly. Witty, hilarious and incredibly compelling with top-notch performances from the entire cast. I had never been a fan of Josh Hartnett before seeing this film, but he perfectly creates this character and has my eyes glued to him the entire film. The twist is a jaw-dropper and really had me stunned. The entire story has this breezy, slick feel to it that's unlike anything I've ever seen in a film and is something I adore watching over and over. Easily one of the best films of 2006 and certainly one of the most underrated of the past decade. An intelligent,hilarious screenplay combined with the fantastic direction of McGuigan and an incredible cast creates a truly amazing film.",9,1,3,2 March 2008
Requiem for a Dream," Overglamorized after-school special.
","It's a powerful, technically brilliant film, but to me it plays more like a graphic afterschool special than a poignant work of art. I understand the message of showing the negative affects of drugs on the human body, but the film makes everything so extreme that it goes to the point of unrealism and almost humor about how graphic and morbid it has to make these people's lives in order to try to get it's message across. I would have understood that drugs are bad without seeing Leto's arm chopped off, Connelly made into a pathetic lowly whore getting screamed at by old men to shove a dildo in her ass while gyrating the other end with another young lady, Burstyn going clinically insane and being electroshocked (a technique that hasn't been used since the 80s) graphically and Wayans experiencing racism while stirring some potatoes. It just takes everything way too far into the extreme for me to appreciate it anymore. In terms of comparing it to the book, it suffers the same flaw that Fight Club does. It puts all of it's attention on one subject matter (the negative affects of drug use) and leaves the rest virtually nonexistent (the beautiful relationship between Harry and Marion turned into bitter hatred on the surface but remaining deep love internally, the strong connection of Harry and Tyrone turned into a distant mutual understanding of being around each other just so they can get another score, pretty much the entire story with Tyrone and his mother, etc. etc.) It puts little touches on these things, but brings them up and then jumps right back into the anti-drug message for 95% of the duration.",3,3,5,8 January 2008
3:10 to Yuma," An action-packed western that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
","A roller coaster ride of flawless action and brilliant dramatic strength. Bale and Crowe are two of the greatest modern actors, in my eyes, and they fail to disappoint in this one. Both of them deliver absolutely exceptional performances and watching them play off one another is one of the most memorable film experiences of my this year in cinema. The supporting performers also turn in some noteworthy work, notably from Ben Foster (who's out of control charismatic brilliance is possibly the highlight of the film for me) and Peter Fonda. It was also great to see Logan Lerman get a meaty part, after the terrible cancellation of the phenomenal television series Jack and Bobby in which he gave a wonderful performance in the title Bobby role. I did feel that Gretchen Mol was pretty underused, though.The story itself also happens to be sensational, consisting of a vast array of beautifully unique and intricate characters. Every character has so many flaws and details provided by the script, making it fascinating to see what happens to them throughout. The action is some of the best I've ever seen. It takes a visceral, gritty and in-your-face look at Western violence. We follow the characters from their point of view as they charge on their horses to rob a bank courier. All of the action is so hard-hitting and intense that it left me hanging onto the edge of my seat. The final battle, as Evans (Bale) and Wade (Crowe) sprint through a town with guns blazing and 30-40 men trying to stop them from reaching the 3:10, is one of the most fascinating and enjoyable rides I've ever experienced.I was, however, quite displeased by the completely unrealistic fact that Evans was sprinting and charging through the town, going just as fast as Wade, when Evans had lost one of his feet during the Civil War and was running on a prosthetic foot. Pretty bizarre that a man with only one actual foot could move that quickly. It's easy to forgive this small displeasure though, due to the sensational work all around. The ending is utterly amazing, as it provides two huge twists that evoked more shock and gasps from the audience than DiCaprio's death in The Departed (which I saw on opening night with a sold out theater, so that's saying a lot). The ending combines an anti-Hollywood, tragic and beautiful death with a very Hollywood (but reasonably so, trust me) decision that I didn't see coming from a mile away. In short, it's definitely one of the best films of the year and more than lived up to all of my great expectations.",9,2,5,8 January 2008
Ali," Another breathtaking show from Mann.
","Mann put a lot of pressure on his head by attempting to create a film that not only tackled the tumultuous ten year dramatic highpoint of Muhammed Ali's life, but also covered the political conflicts and protests of the times and the vast scope of the civil rights movement including the deaths of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. It's a lot to handle in one film that runs under three hours, and I do feel that he should have spent some more time on the lives of possibly the two greatest revolutionaries in American history, but for the running time I don't think anyone could have handled it better than Mann. His distinctive style, mostly through the camera-work, shines through here as always and it never fails to be a pleasure to watch. He makes everything so sleek and engaging that, even when the scenes are dragging a bit, your eyes remained glued to the screen. Though I do wish he would have used a soundtrack closer to the ones he used in Collateral and Miami Vice, instead of the more jazz-focused one for this but I understand his reasoning.The performances are just sensational all around. Smith delivers one of the best of the year and I commend the Academy for recognizing such brilliance. He completely immerses himself into Ali and does nothing short of absolutely becoming the man. It feels like you're actually watching him. Jon Voight undergoes one of the most amazing transformations I've ever seen. I didn't even know who he was playing until the credits rolled. Jamie Foxx also delivers an exceptional work. His emotional trauma is palpable, and I wish that Mann would have spent a bit more time on him. Most biopics go through so much cheesy sentimentality that it becomes a chore to watch by the end, but Mann goes in a completely opposite direction and presents a hard-hitting, realistic drama that doesn't pull any punches. The boxing scenes are the greatest in film history, from my perspective. Most films use slow motion and fancy camera techniques to make boxing more dramatic, but Mann just puts the camera in the ring and presents it all exactly how it is, just like he does with all of his films. The man is a cinematic genius, easily one of the greatest directors of all time, and this is just another example.",8,1,3,8 January 2008
Catch Me If You Can," Old school fun.
","What starts off as a very entertaining story of one of the nation's biggest criminals becomes a unique character study of a young man running away from not only the law and a dysfunctional family, but running away from himself as well. It explores every facet of Abagnale's life while remaining wickedly entertaining and perfectly stylish (the costume design and set decoration are incredible). DiCaprio gives another knockout performance Hanks delivers what might be my favorite performance of his. Walken and Amy Adams are also quite excellent (as is Jennifer Garner in her cameo). A really fun, enjoyable ride with a lot more under the surface than it seems to have. It's easily my favorite Spielberg and definitely one of the best of 2002. I should also mention that the score is incredible.",9,0,2,8 January 2008
Stop-Loss," A devastating character study; not a war film.
","Last year, the film industry produced a series of Iraq-war based films that flopped immensely at the box office. Stop-Loss appears to be no different, and that's a true shame because this one actually deserves praise and deserves to be a success; because it's brilliant. Films like Lions for Lambs or In the Valley of Elah dealt with conspiracy in the government and the politics of the war, or the battles happening over there. With this the films try to strike an emotional chord with audiences who have no experience in the war; people who aren't soldiers but may be related to them or have no real connection to the war whatsoever. But in doing so they develop a cold, unemotional feeling that I can't get over and disables me from making any kind of emotional connection to the characters and as a result I end up disliking the film.Stop-Loss couldn't be more different and that's why it succeeds so admirably. Its name is derived from a horrific injustice that's being used on soldiers (a sort of backdoor draft which allows the military to send soldiers back into combat after they've completed their military contract) but the actual use of stop-loss is just the motivation to get the plot going. Not to say that this tactic the military employs is taken lightly in the film. Director Kimberly Peirce hits us hard with the tragic, dirty-handed use of force that the military uses but its effect on the soldiers takes a backseat to the torturous experience of trying to get back to their life after fighting through the horrors of war. The film focuses primarily on three soldiers and all three men have their own wrenching story about trying to cope with life after the war.The film opens up in Iraq as an attack on a group of soldiers leads a chase scene through a barren city and into a narrow alley. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) leads these soldiers into the alley, where an ambush strikes them. The next few minutes are some of the most wrenching, horrifying moments of war I've seen on screen. A grenade rolls into the alley and Rico Rodriguez (Victor Rasuk) dives to protect one of his fellow soldiers. As a result, half of his skin is burnt severely and eventually he loses his right arm and right leg. Brandon scrambles to get control of the situation and protect his men, but the chaos is too much. Tommy Burgess (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) sees his best friend take a bullet in the jaw and another in the neck. He snaps and picks up a machine gun and starts taking down everyone he sees on the rooftops attacking him. Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum) follows an attacker into a building, despite Brandon's warning. A few moments later we hear him calling for help and Brandon quickly storms in. Brandon saves Steve but not after killing a few innocent civilians (including a woman and some children) with two grenades, whose only crime was living with a man who attacked these soldiers. Later on in the film, we find out that an event even more traumatic occurred while Brandon walked Steve out of the blood-stained building.Soon after when they return home, Brandon finds that he has more problems than dealing with the trauma of his friends. He reports to turn in his gear to the military and is stunned to find that he is assigned to report back to duty at the end of the month. When he complains to his higher-up, he ends up being escorted to military prison to wait until he is shipped back. Thinking on his feet, Brandon takes down the two men escorting him, finds Steve's jeep and drives off. He is officially AWOL. When he tells his family and Michelle what happens, they are also stunned and struggle thinking of what to do. Brandon remembers a Senator telling him that if he ever needs a favor, to ask him, and decides to head up to Washington D.C. to take the Senator up on his offer. Steve's fiancée Michelle (Abbie Cornish) offers to drive with him, knowing that Steve is likely to suffer from stop-loss as well. So off they go on a road trip to try and stop this cruelty to soldiers.This film is getting hit with more insults about being just another 'anti-war' or 'anti-Iraq film'. Due to these claims, it's going to fail at the box office just like every other film labeled with that title has. The tragic thing about that is the fact that this film really has little to do with Iraq. Peirce never implies whether she is for or against the war and none of the characters do. She criticizes the government's use of the stop-loss technique, but whether you support the war or not it is quite clear that what they are doing to these men is so wrong that it should be criminal. This film is an incredibly devastating character study focused around men who are torn apart mentally because of the war, but in doing that Peirce doesn't come out and say that the war is wrong. She says that stop-loss is wrong and that men who suffer from the war shouldn't be sent back there within a month of returning home. An impressive film that struck me deeply and still has me holding back tears when I think of it.",9,4,11,7 April 2008
Casablanca," Simply amazing.
","Possibly the most iconic picture in cinematic history. It's a film that doesn't rely on subtext and deep symbolism in order to impress the audience. This one is all about the story, and it's a magnificent one at that. Another picture that focuses on the lives of people who are indirectly involved in the war and how it changes them. Rick and Ilsa are two of the most complex and beautiful characters ever brought to film, in my opinion. Their romance is beautiful and the effect that leaving one another has on them is utterly tragic. Watching Rick brood while throwing back shot after shot the night after his first encounter with Ilsa in years is one of the most brutal and well acted scenes I've ever witnessed. He pours his heart and soul into the performance, as does Bergman, and everything about watching them is just sensational. You just know that you're watching magic. Their final moments together are some of the most shattering I've ever seen. It truly ripped my heart into a thousand pieces. Bergman delivers one of the greatest female performances I've ever seen, and Bogart is simply phenomenal as well.",10,2,4,8 January 2008
Finding Neverland," An uplifting beauty.
","Some may call this epic tale of finding happiness in the most unexpected places to be too 'cheesy' or overly sentimental, but I'm inclined to disagree. In this day and age of modern cinema where every week there are three new films released that are gritty, hard-hitting and feature devastatingly pessimistic finales it's a wonder to find a film like Finding Neverland. Something so euphoric, uplifting and purely joyous. Especially when I've been hitting such a brutal case of depression, a film as optimistic as this was the perfect thing to get my mood in a state of happiness for the first time in as long as I can remember. Forster creates a fantastic fairy tale dream of one man's loneliness being cured by a wonderful family, who are full of their own flaws.The story centers around playwright J.M. Barrie, played by Johnny Depp in the most perfect decision of his career, who is suffering a terrible case of mediocrity in his writing abilities. This lack of ability seems to stem from troubles at home where his wife Mary (the increasingly diverse Radha Mitchell) barely notices his existence and is far more focused on their social status than their marital one. In a wonderful meeting of chance, Barrie encounters the Llewelyn Davies family at the park one afternoon. This chance meeting turns into the luckiest experience of Mr. Barrie's life and also happens to be quite the blissful experience for the Davies' as well. We are then taken on a journey of watching J.M. burst out of his writer's block with the help of this beautifully imaginative family, and see that they needed his help just as much as he needed their's.After a devastating loss of the families male lead, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (played masterfully by Kate Winslet) is left with four boys all to herself. Her slowly decreasing medical condition only makes matters worse and the film is filled with a constant state of approaching dread. Of course, since the film is perfectly magical, even as she passes on it's the beautiful imaginative hearts of Barrie and her four boys that help Sylvia leave this world in a complete state of happiness. With this wonderful relationship established between this family and this married man, we do get glimpses of the obvious tolls it takes on everyone's life. Barrie's marriage falls apart, he receives criticism from the community at large for the nature of his relationship with Sylvia and even the boys and Sylvia's mother constantly tries to bring the spirit of the family down. But it's the magic of these characters and this story that carry the picture on and keep joyous spirit alive.Another interesting subplot to the film is the relationship between James and one of the Davies boys in particular, this boy being Peter (the inspiration for Barrie's title character Peter Pan, played by relative newcomer Freddie Highmore). Peter seems to be the one who struggles the most over the loss of his father and the addition of J.M. into the family life is one of painful sorrow and needed relief for him. He struggles with his feelings of James seemingly replacing his father and the lack of respect he gets from adults. This climaxes in a gut-wrenching scene as Peter destroys the faux-stage that the brother's set up in what is a brilliant display of acting from the young Highmore. Ultimately, Barrie takes Peter under his wing and teaches him the magic of imagination and appropriately helps him to find the infamous Neverland which represents the blissful place in your imagination where no harm can come to you.I mentioned it before, but I would like to go back to Depp's fantastic and deservedly Oscar-nominated performance. The genius of Johnny Depp is clearly displayed in his decision to take this subtle and beautiful role after the eccentricity and wild charisma of playing Captain Jack Sparrow. His performance is very reserved, but this in no way makes it any lesser than his other work. In fact, I believe it to be one of the best portrayal's of his entire career and his best work of this decade so far. All of the performances in this sensational film are excellent (Winslet is another one to be remembered) but this truly is Johnny's show. A dynamic feat in what is now surprisingly one of my favorite films.",9,3,3,8 January 2008
Training Day," Original and engrossing.
","Police corruption is a topic that is used numerous times in films to the point of annoyance, but this one makes it much more gritty and realistic than any example I can think of. I'm always a fan of the 'Good v. Evil' scenario and this one employs it perfectly. The polar opposites that the film creates in Alonzo and Hoyt (the former being completely corrupt, the latter being completely pure) are very interesting and the balance between them kept me engaged the entire film. As we watch Hoyt try to understand this new world that he's been thrown into, while still trying to keep his morality and good nature intact, we realize (just like he does) that there is no right or wrong. You have to create a balance, because the line 'It's not what you know, it's what you can prove.' couldn't be more true, so sometimes that's why you have to bend the rules in order to bring the bad guys down. The ending is one of my all time favorites, as Hoyt leaves Alonzo to be murdered by the numerous men out to get him because he can't arrest him and he can't kill him himself. Brilliant. Both of the lead performances are excellent, and Denzel's win was fully deserved. His charisma and the fact that his character was so against his normal 'good guy' type made for such an interesting and ethereal portrayal of one of my favorite characters. The only thing that I wasn't a fan of was the huge coincidence that the girl Hoyt randomly saved from being raped just happened to be the cousin of the man who was about to kill him. I found that insanely dumb, but it didn't affect my opinion on the film at all.",9,1,2,9 January 2008
Unbreakable," Easily Shyamalan's best.
","One of my favorite techniques in the film is Shyamalan's use of color contrast, that is very unique to how most directors use it. He uses vibrant colors (orange, red, purple) to highlight the antagonist(s) and uses very dull colors (green, brown, black) to blend the protagonist into the background. It helps to display the films overall theme of someone completely ordinary having the abilities of someone extraordinary. The cinematography itself is very fresh and original. Seeing Willis' conversation on the train through the point of view of the girl sitting in front of him was a great technique. I also liked seeing the scene between young Elijah and his mother reflected off of the television screen. Another unique strategy used by Shyamalan.The performances are some of the best work done by the actors involved. Willis is very subtle and flawlessly melancholy in what I firmly believe is his greatest performance. Jackson is, like the theme of the film, on the other side of the spectrum. Vibrant and extravagant, using great vocal power in everything he says. The film is just full of these contrasts between Willis and Jackson which Shyamalan uses brilliantly. The twist itself is one of the best I've ever seen. It's subtle and extremely unpredictable. Also, the fact that the entire film isn't based on this twist (unlike The Sixth Sense) makes it that much less predictable.",9,1,1,9 January 2008
Shakespeare in Love," One of the best I've seen in quite a while.
","A whimsical, hilarious, tragic story about a forbidden love between a then-common playwright and a beautiful woman with her wealth forcing her to wed another man. It's one of the most sharply written films I've ever seen, that completely draws you in from the first moment where we see Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson) order his men to chop off Philip Henslowe's (Geoffrey Rush) nose and ear to the very end as Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) walk up the beach.The film centers around the young Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) who is desperately trying to sell his work in order to keep on living. As him and theater owner Henslowe are auditioning for the lead in his new play, he meets a young boy whom he thinks is perfect for the part. The boy runs away after realizing that it's Shakespeare, and Will follows him to his home where he meets Viola (who he later finds out was disguised as the young boy due to her love of theater). And thus begins this beautiful romance between two lovers who are torn apart by status and society.This story has it's share of hilarious moments mixed with absolutely tragic ones, but never manages to drag or stop being one of the most compelling pictures I've ever seen. I also really love all of the subtle references to rumors regarding Shakespeare and the allusions to his other plays that occur throughout the film. The performances are all glorious and the technical aspects (the costume design, set decoration and score in particular) are easily among the best of the decade. Surely a masterpiece which more than deserved it's Best Picture win.",10,0,0,10 May 2008
Dawn of the Dead," Fun enough.
","An exceptionally fun, zombie-slaying time. It sticks to the basic horror formula of 'Everything is fine, turmoil, everything is good again, huge problem, attempt to solve it, happy ending' but makes everything a lot more fun and gory than the average weekly gorefest. The performances are all pretty nice, notably a surprising turn from Sarah Polley into a much more mainstream environment, and no one really distracts from the story of the film. All of the gore and violent scenes are very well done and are some of the best entertainment of the decade. Attempts at a more supernatural form of horror, like the baby delivery, are poorly done and tend to take you out of the thrill of the rest of the film but they are few and far in between. It gets a bit dull at time, but as always, the final act is exhilarating and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The finale is bittersweet and a perfect end to the picture.",6,0,1,8 January 2008
12 Monkeys," Amazes every time.
","Probably one of the most complex stories ever crafted on film, Twelve Monkeys is also one of the most engaging. It compelled me from the moment it started to the second the credits started rolling. I've seen it many times and each time I see some small symbolisms that I didn't notice before, but I don't think I'll ever be able to grasp every single symbol that Gilliam put into this brilliant film. I'm honestly blown away by how ingenious the story is every time I see it. It's surely a science-fiction but it's almost like a thriller in the many twists and turns that the plot takes and every time I see it, I'm still amazed. The complexity and detail that Peoples and Gilliam put into this film is breathtaking. Truly one of the marvels of cinematic history. Of course I also have to mention Brad Pitt's absurdly charismatic performance which is among the best I've ever seen. Bruce Willis is also quite good.",10,7,9,24 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A letdown from the first, but still pretty fun.
","It's very rare that we see a sequel surpass it's original, and Dead Man's Chest is no exception. The original is fresh, inventive, utterly hilarious and one of the most entertaining films of all time. This go around is stale, tedious and blends between overly cheesy and simply odd. However for all of it's flaws, it remains a massively entertaining piece of Grade A blockbuster action. Johnny Depp provides another wildly outrageous and charismatically riveting performance, but the rest of the cast ranges from dry and repetitive, yet still insanely beautiful (Knightley) to some of the worst I've ever seen (Bloom, of course). The story is completely insignificant and wildly convoluted. Jack owes a debt to Davey Jones. Something about a beastie. Sexual tension between Jack and Elizabeth. Just ridiculous reasons to keep letting Johnny be eccentric and hilarious, to provide some perfectly amazing action that is among the most entertaining I've ever seen and, ultimately, to bring in more money. Despite all of the flaws and repetitiveness of the film, the beauty of watching Johnny Gone Wild and the massive quality of entertainment that the film contains makes it completely worthwhile in my eyes.",6,0,2,8 January 2008
The English Patient," An epic story of love.
","A passionate tale of determination and romance. Like with all of Minghella's work, every single character is so layered and complex. He takes time and devotion to give each character a sufficient amount of intricacy that we truly feel like we know these people and when one of them feels pain, we do as well. When one of them is joyous (the rain scene, for instance) our faces light up with glee.There's Hana, the caring nurse who is too afraid of love to let anyone near her since right from the start the two closest people to her are destroyed by the war. Slowly her friendship with Almasy becomes stronger and stronger and it gives her the courage and determination to pursue a sexual relationship with Kip, who is also a very complex character. On the surface we see him as a kind man, who is very spiritual and loving. But near the end he realizes how isolated he is and the fact that he barely even knew his best friend whom he worked side by side with for years sends him into a complete breakdown. This leads to a very emotional scene, where Binoche really shines. Next up there is David Caravaggio, a spy who eventually gets captured and loses his thumbs while being tortured for information. He sets out on a vengeance to murder everyone connected to his capture, which leads him to Almasy, his final target. But being around Almasy and realizing the pain and suffering that he has been through leads him to look deep inside himself and realize that he doesn't need his revenge. He relieves himself of all this pain and anguish and in the end we see him with a bright grin, just happy to be alive, thumbs or not.Katharine Clifton is a character very similar to those in the past, but she has an extra spark that makes her very unique. As her husband spends less and less attention to her, she becomes involved in a tumultuous love affair with Almasy which leads to some of the most beautifully romantic scenes ever brought to cinema. Minghella easily could have made her another whiny, confused housewife who just passed in and out of the film with no real connection the audience but he bestowed her with a certain grace and dignity which made us want her to have a happy ending and made us adore seeing her and Almasy enjoying each other's company. Even Geoffrey Clifton becomes a layered character when we learn that he isn't venturing off to do photographs, but is instead helping the army explore territory. So while he could have just been another ignorant husband to an adulterous wife, Minghella adds intricacy to him. And of course the entire story all revolves around Almasy, the man who would do anything, even sell out his country to the enemy, just to be with the woman he loved. A truly romantic and beautiful tale.What I found very interesting, though, was how Minghella subtly displays the horrors and terrible effects that war has on the people that aren't even physically fighting it. Through Hana we see a woman who is permanently destroyed and almost unable to love due to the fact that this awful war took away everyone who became close to her. In Kip we see a man who is so blinded by his job and duty to his country that he never even takes the time to appreciate the man he considers his best friend. Caravaggio takes abuse after abuse, with unimaginable pain being inflicted on him as a result of the war. The Cliftons are a loving couple, who have no troubles whatsoever until the war starts and Geoffrey is off helping his country while Katharine becomes involved in an affair. But the most horrific effect of war is shown constantly through Almasy's story. All he wanted was love and companionship, but the war wouldn't allow him that. He only gets his love because of the war, and due to it's changing seriousness his love is ripped away from him and he falls into complete heartache. Then we see him reclaim this love, and he does whatever he can to save her life. But, as Binoche mentions early on the film, when war times come even your name means a great deal. We see this terribly through Almasy who is beaten, dragged away and arrested merely due to his name when all he was trying to do was save the woman he loved. Of course we see the effect of war physically through Almasy in the horrific burning of his entire body. This film shows no huge war scenes and terrible travesties that blow off limbs and open chest cavities, but it manages to send an anti-war message stronger than I've ever seen before. No physical battle is shown, whatsoever, yet it makes me absolutely detest war due to the effect that it has on those who aren't even directly involved.As always for a Minghella work, the performances are absolutely brilliant. Fiennes, Binoche, Thomas and Dafoe deliver some of the best work of the decade. Simply through their eyes we can see all of the pain and emotion searing through them. The right actors were definitely cast in this one. We never hear them shout or break down into a ten minute fit of crying and throwing objects across the room, but we see all of their anguish and torture simply through their eyes and facial expressions. It's a beautifully subtle way of showing emotion and really helped make the film the brilliant masterpiece that it is. I highly doubt that any other cast could have pulled it off so seamlessly.",10,17,24,9 January 2008
The Other Boleyn Girl," Inaccurate, uninteresting and terribly acted.
","The historical inaccuracies are mind-boggling. It feels like they sat down said 'Alright, we know that Henry will bang both of them and that Anne will have Elizabeth. That's all we need. Let's make the rest of it as sexy as possible.' The ironic thing being that with a PG-13 rating, you can't really be sexy. Especially not when you make Scarlett Johansson incredibly unattractive and knock down Portman's looks a few knots as well. They advertised it as this massively erotic soap opera and it was just a melodramatic, unappealing mess that couldn't have been further from sensual. The technical achievements are pretty solid; the cinematography, costume design and score are certainly among the best of the year so far but none of that makes the film worth watching. I would say that Natalie Portman's good performance makes the film slightly worth sitting through, but the positive aspect in that is completely cancelled out by the atrocity that is whatever Scarlett Johansson did. Calling that a performance would be an insult to performers. It was terrible.",4,2,3,15 June 2008
Hot Fuzz," More fun is rare to find.
","In the tradition of Shaun of the Dead, the trio (Wright, Pegg, Frost) create a film that is much more of an homage than a comedy. And what a brilliant homage it is. The first half mainly consists of the dry, witty humor that played throughout most of Shaun of the Dead. Personally, I was a huge fan of this. Coming from a British background, I really adored all of the dry British humor that was used and the clever spoofing of some of the action genres biggest moments/situations was also quite hilarious. Unlike the Scary Movies of the modern world, Fuzz knows how to do a parody. It doesn't go insanely over the top and gimmicky, barely linking the story together with scrapes of former film plots. Instead it bases the entire film around one plot, and cleverly pokes fun of other films in scenes or perfectly disposed one liners. The second half is just a complete explosion of action and frenzy. The homage is perfected with some of the best and most engaging action I've ever seen, as well as being filtered with some great humor (Timothy Dalton with a spike through his chin moaning 'Owie'? I'm in.) that makes the experience all the more enjoyable. The trio once again creates one of the most hilariously entertaining films I've had the pleasure of seeing, and I'm sure I'll be able to watch it a thousand times without getting the slightest bit bored. On a side note, the cameos from Cate Blanchett, Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy and Peter Jackson are absolutely wonderful and hilarious.",9,0,0,8 January 2008
Troy," Some swords-and-sandals entertainment.
","Loads of high-adrenaline entertainment that was put together brilliantly on screen in some of the best choreographed battles in cinematic history. Was it just me, or did Kruger have a different accent in every scene? Plus...just a really awful performance on every level, though I think the same applies to Bloom. Other than that I thought acting-wise it was pretty well done, particularly from the beautiful Rose Byrne. Eric Bana and Brad Pitt were very intense and perfectly embodied the legendary soldiers that were superior to entire armies. The film was a little...overexaggerated (which was a good and bad quality, depending on the situation) even when it comes to the grand war that it was and some of the dialogue is too cheesy to stand for the most part. The choreography was beautiful, and I found a morbidly poetic sensation during the invasion of Troy. Perhaps the thousands of soldiers silently charging across the sand gave me this feeling. The ideas of getting rid of the Gods direct involvement and making Achilles an unstoppable badass added a lot to the film, especially in terms of entertainment which seemed to be Petersen's main priority (if it wasn't, then uh oh).",7,1,2,9 January 2008
Brokeback Mountain," A modern masterpiece.
","Destined to become an American classic, Brokeback Mountain is a tragic story of painfully forbidden love in a world full of prejudice. The story is compelling and deeply heartbreaking with an ending that leaves me in tears every time. It's such a powerful story that was weaved so perfectly by Annie Proulx and adapted flawlessly by Larry McMurtry. Ang Lee's direction captures the beauty of the scenery (an aspect also captured by the score) and the pain of these characters like no one else could. The story is somehow completely subtle yet absolutely wrenching. Rarely has an ending drained me as much as this one.Of course when talking about the film you have to mention the performances, which are among the best of the decade. Heath Ledger (my win) is shattering as Ennis Del Mar, the more masculine of the couple who fights his love for Jack because of the consequences that society will place upon them. Jake Gyllenhaal is just as wrenching as Jack Twist, the more open of the two who wants nothing more than to be with Ennis for the rest of his life. Michelle Williams is also heartbreaking (a word that I use a lot, but mean every time when discussing the film) as Ennis' first wife, Alma, who discovers their secret and tears herself apart trying to keep her family together. Anne Hathaway and Linda Cardellini also deliver strong performances.On the surface, Brokeback Mountain is simply an emotional story of two forbidden lovers. But in this love story, it weaves the prejudices of American society on homosexuality that is so true of today even though the story takes place a few decades ago. It never blatantly judges society, but in it's story we see the ignorance and absolutely despicable way that people look upon homosexuals. Even in Ennis' denial of his love for Jack we can see this. Overall, it's a wrenching story with some absolutely phenomenal performances. Destined to become a classic and certainly one of my all time favorites.",10,18,20,23 January 2008
Ed Wood," An uplifting portrait of one bizarre man.
","Tim Burton takes a chronicling of the 'worst director of all time' and transforms into something far beyond that. He crafts a film about ambition and the dedication a man took in order to follow that ambition and turn it into a reality. He shows us a man who follows his dream, no matter how bad the reviews are. We see that it's not the world's dream, and it's not something that will be critically accepted in his industry but it is Ed Wood's dream and his final success of getting his picture made is one that completed his life. An uplifting tale of self-acceptance over doing things based on what other's perceive as excellent.The performances really take charge in this one. Martin Landau greatly deserved his Oscar win for his portrayal of the late Bela Lugosi. His transformation is vital to the story as it's Bela who really charges Ed's career and inspires him to become the legend he eventually became. Martin captures the drug addicted, bitter old man's essence with ease and makes us feel as if we're watching the real deal. Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette also deliver superb performances, each taking over one half of Ed's romantic life. For me though, the real star of this one was Johnny Depp. He has stated that his portrayal of Wood was a mixture of 'the blind optimism of Ronald Regan, the enthusiasm of the Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz and Casey Kasem'. As bizarre as that sounds, it looks as though he hit the nail on the head and delivers one of the best performances of his career. A true marvel to watch, as he always is for me.",9,1,1,8 January 2008
Juno," Massively overrated.
","Juno is a very cute film about witty little high-schooler Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) and her unplanned pregnancy after losing her virginity along with the awkward Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). While being very cute for the most part, having one of my favorite endings ever, some pretty good performances (and one phenomenal one) and some absolutely hilarious scenes the film managed to be a massive disappointment for me. The dialogue, while sometimes hilarious, was mostly painfully annoying and so 'look at me I'm tres hip' that it almost made me choke on my vomit. Even the plot was horribly contrived at it's core. Obviously Juno is educated well beyond her years, but she doesn't have the intelligence to use a condom, be on birth control or even have Paulie pull out? Fu*king please. Almost as jaw-droppingly outrageous is the fact that she's completely set on getting an abortion until some little Asian classmate tells her that her baby has fingernails and when she gets into the clinic she notices that everybody has fingernails and decides to keep it. On what planet does that happen? It's certainly not Earth. Must be Diablo Cody Land, which is a place I'd never like to visit. I'd read that the film was relatable and realistic to lives of teens. Whoever says that clearly has no idea what the average teen life is, or is just dropping too much acid to have any clue what they're talking about.It also happens to drag pretty badly from time to time and has an insanely unbelievable subplot of romantic tension between Juno and the planned-adoptive father of her future child (Jason Bateman). Grimace. Of course those are really the only gripes I have with the film, though they do happen to be semi-major ones. It was pretty funny from time to time, had an unbelievably wicked soundtrack and some of the dialogue was top-notch. The performances were also pretty good. Michael Cera and Jason Bateman were both well-above average. J.K. Simmons was quite good for the small time that he was on screen. A big letdown, however, was Jennifer Garner as the adoptive mother. She wasn't bad, per say, but the fact that people have been talking about her performance as award-worthy is completely absurd. Nothing remotely above average. The star of the film though, the cute little Ellen Page, was phenomenal. In what could have been a very one-note performance she added a massive amount of depth and absorption into her character. Just like last year in Hard Candy, she floored me with her flawless portrayal.",9,8,31,5 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," What did I just see?
","As a big fan of the first film and one of the few people who genuinely enjoyed the second one, I have to say that At World's End was pretty dreadful. There were so many characters, all with their own elaborate plots and motivations but not in a 'Wow, this movie is so beautiful and complex' kind of way. More in a 'What the hell is happening? Why are they doing that?' kind of way. It seemed like they tried to throw in as many characters and plots as possible and that would make the best film, but it turned out horribly. I spent half the time being completely confused as to whom was fighting whom and for what reason, and everyone just popped in and out of the situations and disappeared back into nowhere with no real explanation. The addition of this insane amount of pirate lords just made me wonder where all of these characters were in the first two films when everyone was fighting over an enormous amount of gold and being destroyed by The Flying Dutchman. Speaking of The Flying Dutchman, the fact that they actually managed to make Davey Jones frightening in the first film was ruined by making him a pushover in this one, just like every other character.The acting is all outrageously flat or completely artificial, sans Geoffrey Rush who unfortunately came back for this one. It just always felt like the characters knew ten times more about the situation than we did and the audience was supposed to look past that because of all the cool explosions. Every character had in-depth plots and backstories but we see two seconds of that and then move on to the next person. The humor is virtually gone, with a few laughs here and there but for a franchise that builds itself on mixing quirky humor with big action it's lacking in the comedy and tries to make up for it by increasing immensely with the action. Depp, who generally provided all of the comic relief in the first two, is stuck doing lame schtick where he sees different versions of himself that made me laugh...once. That being said it still manages to be entertaining for the parts where I wasn't completely lost and I actually liked the ending, even though it felt like it was never going to come. A letdown, surely.",5,2,3,4 December 2007
Yes Man," Say yes!
","Yes Man follows the same basic genre comedy structure that we've seen an endless amount of times in the past few years. The main character has a big problem, they work to solve that problem, the problem is solved and happy times are had. Then another problem arises as a result to the solution to the original problem. So everyone is sad. But then that problem is solved and everyone lives happily ever after. And there's a message about how to live your life sprinkled in there. For every single comedy in the past few years with that structure, I've gotten so bored by the time it's over because I just lose interest when the drama comes in during the third act. I either don't care about the characters or I don't care about the message.Every comedy except for this one. Not only did I care about the characters so much (thanks mostly to the performances from Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel who put a beautiful, free-spirited romance at the core of this seemingly typical comedy) that I was emotionally impacted during that predictable turn for the worse near the end, but the message of the film was actually something that I found relatable to my own life which is something I've never experience during these kind of comedies. I'm definitely a man who doesn't really live his life (as cheesy as that sounds) because I isolate myself by making excuses to just be alone and not be with anyone. As a result, I was definitely more invested in this film than I have been with other comedies of the same vein.Add to all this the fact that it's completely hilarious throughout to the point where I have no hesitation in calling it the funniest movie of the year and easily the best straight comedy (not that there have been many good ones; three by my count). Plus, of course, Zooey Deschanel is absolutely infectious in every moment she's on screen (especially her lovely singing). I love her more than air, and this is just another example of why that love is justified. Call it fanboyism if you must, but she's my #2 of the year in supporting actress right now falling second only to the Cruz. In summation, do yourself a favor and say yes to this great comedy.I'm so sorry, I had to say it.",8,234,275,20 December 2008
Zodiac," Fincher's best since Se7en.
","Personally, I find David Fincher to be an overrated director who aims his films at every teenage boy trying to look totally awesome because he can quote Fight Club, but I all admit that I'm a pretty big fan of his wonderful thriller, Se7en. Since he created that unnerving, psychological journey in 1995 all I've seen from him has been one mediocre formulaic thriller after the other with the complete disgrace that was Fight Club in the middle. Zodiac is a much more adult film for Fincher, and it's easily his best since Se7en and the second entry to his resume that I can honestly say I admire. The story of the infamous serial killer has always been one of great interest to me; I first discovered it years ago and read Robert Graysmith's book that the film is based on a few years ago. Fincher does this disturbing, extremely mysterious story justice by creating an adult thriller that covers every big element of the still-open investigation that has spanned decades.In order to capture everything without making a ten hour production, he was forced to jump across extremely different amounts of time (from as little as ten hours to as long as four years). Surprisingly, he does this with great skill and the film never manages to drag or distract due to this gaps in time. It's a taut, unnerving tale that thoroughly studies the mystery of the Zodiac killer and shows the effect that this case takes on three very different men. A charismatic, witty reporter who eventually gets threats on his life (Robert Downey Jr.), a young cartoonist who takes the investigation under his wing once everyone else has all but given up (Jake Gyllenhaal) and the head detective who is destroyed by the case and even gets accused of forging letters from the Zodiac in order to boost his own fame (Mark Ruffalo). All three performances are excellent, but Downey and Ruffalo really amazed me. They are two of my favorite actors and they still manage to catch me off guard by how outstanding their portrayals are.",8,1,2,9 January 2008
Milk," Believe the hype.
","Pretty much perfect. I do have one complaint with the film though; we should have seen more Dan White. It felt like they just spaced out scenes for him where he showed up every ten minutes after his first appearance and each scene of his was a big block of character development. It did a good job of demonstrating what led him to kill Harvey Milk, but didn't give us a chance to sympathize with him or even really understand why he did it beyond the basics. I felt like there was a lot more depth to him beneath the surface and while Josh Brolin did a great job of showing the insecurities and anger of the character internally, I wanted to see his flaws fleshed out more in the actual story instead of just in Brolin's performance. Aside from that, I have no complaints with the film.I've seen a lot of people call it an unconventional biopic, and while I can't really agree with that, it's definitely the pinnacle of a biopic. I'm tempted to say that Sean Penn has never been better than he is here and I'm struggling to think of a reason why that wouldn't be true. People say it about performances all of the time, but it's really true here; Sean Penn became Harvey Milk. He embodied the life and soul of Milk and completely disappears into the character. It's one of those cases where you think he's not really doing anything impressive...but that's what makes it so impressive. He lives and breathes the character so much that it just becomes his natural persona for the duration of the film and you don't realize just how brilliant he was until it's all over and you think 'That was Sean Penn that entire time.' An impeccable performance if I ever saw one. No one can beat Sam Rockwell (in Snow Angels) for me this year, but since he's not a contender I'm throwing my hat in the 'Give Sean Penn another Oscar.' ring as of now.Gus Van Sant's direction was superb; he used the technique of bleeding real footage into the movie footage that we've seen before, but something about the way he did it made it all feel very organic which I loved. He made everything lively and fresh while not getting in the way of the actors doing their jobs and that's pretty hard to find. The screenplay incorporated all of these big, epic moments of Milk's history into the story of his personal and political life without missing a beat or making anything feel like 'Oh, this is just building up to that big speech.' which is a problem that occurs with a lot of biopics. Danny Elfman's score ranges from emotionally powerful to beautiful to quietly haunting without getting in the way of the rest of the story. It's my favorite of the year so far. The cinematography gave a very intimate feel to everything from the first love scene between Milk and James Franco's character Scott Smith to those big speeches and marches unlike most films where they make those moments seem grand and out-of-this-world. But here everything is very 'in the moment' throughout.And finally, the acting from the entire cast is brilliant. Penn leads the front with an Oscar-worthy portrayal. Josh Brolin is emotional and painfully insecure in his own body. James Franco goes from being the gorgeous, flirty young boy to a brooding man who just wants to be with the man he loves but that man is too busy focusing on much grander things. Emile Hirsch is adorable, driven and wildly charismatic. And the rest of the campaign cast did a great job of blending organically into their roles.",10,6,13,18 December 2008
Cloverfield," Quite the experience.
","The hand-held camera was a little annoying at first, but once I got used to it, it was phenomenal. The visual effects are outstanding. The monster is one of the most incredible things I've ever seen. It truly scared the hell out of me...and was just technically amazing. I can't even describe it. Those little spider bastards were bloody well done too. The acting all felt really authentic, like we really were just watching these people reacting to the situation. So that was cool. There were definitely some little things that irked me, some people surviving at certain points in the film, a thousand questions that I want some answers for, and the really cheesy ending...but for the most part it was badass. Surprisingly pretty great. The direction was top-notch.",9,1,8,18 January 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Burton was made for Sleepy Hollow.
","Tim Burton's entire career has been based on films that provide the paradox of a hauntingly magical style. I believe that Sleepy Hollow can be described as the perfect Tim Burton picture in the sense that it captures everything that comes to mind when you think of the man. The Gothic style, haunting ambiance, bizarre and wickedly charismatic humor and a sense that you're living in a dark fairy tale for a few hours. It stays morbidly entertaining all the way throughout and never fails at keeping you on the edge of your seat. Burton crafts another phenomenal work that utterly defines his unique style.Everyone knows the story of the Headless Horseman from their childhood, but this takes a much darker and necessary tone to the tale than seen before. The technical aspects of the feature certainly help to achieve this and create wonders for the eye to behold. The sets are vast and glorious, creating that perfectly Gothic ambiance and almost Wicker Man-esquire eeriness. In fact the entire film has a lot of similarities with The Wicker Man from the supernatural ideals to the suspense of knowing that something is going on that is much bigger than what we believe. The cinematography, costumes and visuals all add to create a poetically dreary experience that is sure to please in every element.Burton also shows his strong ability in the casting category. The choice of Depp for the leading role of Ichabod Crane (a character who was portrayed as brutally unattractive in the story) is an odd one at first glance, but the decision to show his flaws through personality made Depp the perfect man to nail this one. I've always thought that the contrast between Ichabod and the Horseman is an interesting one; Crane is a man who lives inside his head and seems bizarre to society, Horseman is a man with no head and strikes fear into society, and Depp certainly captures the quirky eccentricities and creates one of my favorite performances of his. Burton also showed his sense of humor through the casting, by picking out wildly charismatic men to play the leaders of the community (Michael Gambon and Richard Griffiths being the two best examples). Miranda Richardson also delivers a fantastic performance and almost steals the show. All in all, a wickedly entertaining picture that is sure to delight through and through.",10,0,0,8 January 2008
The Beach," Has it's flaws but I was pleasantly surprised.
","It's a fascinating film that delves into a whole bounty of themes (though this sometimes comes across as the film not really knowing what it wants to be, to me at least) and features a sensational performance from DiCaprio. I saw Richard as naive and selfish and really sitting on the border between man and boy, and I think this comes across wonderfully in Leo's performance. He has instances of extreme maturity (like saving the French couple from the drug farmers when they first arrive on the island) and then moments of extreme immaturity, like talking about Daffy being incinerated while laughing.Some of the choices in the style were really tasteless from my perspective (the scene with Richard and Francoise making love in the water and the scene with Richard inside the video game being the two best examples) but these instances were rare. It does drag a little bit in the middle and the relationship between Richard and Sal seemed really soap opera-esquire but once he was forced into isolation it really picked up into my favorite part of the entire film. This extremely unique study of the isolation of someone who's not quite a man driving him insane was exceptional. His ability to adapt to the jungle while also playing immature little games is just another example of this boy/man battle that was constant throughout.The main story of the film is a bit contrived (I never really bought into the 'hidden island paradise' thing) and the ending was a bit ridiculous as well. The dialogue was pretty poor sometimes to the point of being cringe-worthy but DiCaprio's exceptional performance really helps to hold together some of the sub-par elements of the film; Tilda Swinton was also pretty great. Overall, I nit-picked at a lot of little things but I found it to be quite good.",8,3,5,10 January 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Massively overrated.
","While the idea of contrasting a dark fairy tale with a dark political story of rebellion is quite ingenious, the film ends up being extremely empty and drags far too often. As strong as the performances are the lack of any kind of depth in the mother character results in a lack of sympathy for Ofelia because we never really understand what she's doing all of this for, though I did get teary at the end. The fact that Captain Vidal has absolutely no positive qualities is utterly ridiculous since no one is that sadistic and terrible (even Anton Chigurh showed signs of sympathy) and made the more realistic parts of the story seem that much more unbelievable. The strength of the performances and the jaw-dropping technical aspects can't entirely save a film when it feels so hollow. The ending did manage to bring quite a smile to my face, though.",4,6,15,8 January 2008
Alien," Did I just get Punk'd?
","I'm kind of at a loss for words. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed. I thought the film was one of the most excruciatingly dull I've ever seen. It just dragged on and on, with even the violent scenes were the alien attacks being completely uninteresting because you see nothing that happens. It's just some blurs, some terrible acting, a closeup of the mouth and it's over. The characters were total clichés and completely uninteresting ones at that. I didn't care once about what was going to happen to them. I was just praying they all died and the film ended an hour before it was supposed to. The film wasn't remotely suspenseful or engaging. A lot of scenes were unintentionally laughable because of how absurd they were (like the one in the picture above) or because of how contrived and idiotic they were (like Ash being a robot). As much as I want to give this film a below average rating though, there's no denying that it's technical aspects are phenomenal. The art direction and makeup completely revolutionized science-fiction and the cinematography is ingenious. But when all is said and done I was just bored to tears and extremely disappointed.",5,22,44,29 January 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Another Burton masterpiece.
","A Burton work in the truest sense. Sure it's an adaptation but it feels like something he actually created and his direction is flawless. It's filled with everything he brings to his best films; dark, poetic beauty and aesthetically gorgeous but haunting visuals. His style is at an all time high as he perfectly crafts this dreary London and all of the characters within it (the costume design is also some of the best I've ever seen). All of the songs are so phenomenal combining vocal power and intensity with wonderfully unique and fun rhythm, while having sometimes hilarious and always dark lyrics.The performances all combine to be one of my favorite ensembles of the year. Depp is as good as ever. His raspy voice is perfect for the vengeful, murder-driven mind of Sweeney Todd. Likewise, Helena Bonham Carter's exhausted voice is the perfect embodiment of Mrs. Lovett's internal anguish while her adorable appearance is so cute. She was absolutely perfect for this role (just as Depp was for Todd) and perfectly captures the love that Lovett has for Sweeney, which makes the ending that much more devastating. The rest of the cast is exceptional. Rickman and Spall have a lot of fun with their characters. Jamie Bower and Laura Kelly bring some of the best vocals I've ever heard. But the real surprise of the film was the young Ed Sanders who creates one of the most sympathetic and warm characters I've seen in quite a while. The power of his voice is truly stunning. Of course Sacha Baron Cohen is also there and Burton took the best approach possible with him. Cohen is funny in the time that he's there, but Burton was wise and gave him the axe (erm, knife) before he was on screen long enough to become unbearably annoying.Of course behind every film I love, there is a story that I adore. On the surface, basically none of the characters are likable but somehow the story makes Todd and Lovett two of the most sympathetic characters I've seen in quite sometime. It makes their actions perfectly understandable, however absurd and sinful they are. I was behind Todd every step of the way and wanted him to succeed in every aspect of his murderous plot. A phenomenal film in every way that truly lived up to my original expectations.",10,4,8,13 January 2008
Blades of Glory," Could have been much better.
","A very fun and entertaining comedy that does a seamless blend of over-the-top physical comedy combined with a subtle but respectful mockery of the ice skating profession. The genius, and downfall, of the film all comes in the casting. The decision to put Will Arnett and Amy Poehler in the same film is one of the most remarkable and praiseworthy of all time. The decision to make the husband/wife team play siblings is even more brilliant. The extra step of adding Jenna Fischer as their other sibling is almost too orgasmic to still be wearing pants. But then...oh, then the earthquake of pain and suffering comes. This is in the form of the unexplainably working Jon Heder. The man is a disgrace to the world. You shouldn't put him on the big screen, you should hide him in a coffin at the bottom of the Atlantic. He isn't and never will be funny in any form of the word, until he is being murdered by me in which I'll be laughing my head off. Ferrell is always fun, though he is still just playing the 'Arrogant, idiotic and talented' type that he's been playing since 2004's Anchorman. Scenes between him and Heder, which is the majority of the film, only help to make me realize how little screen time the combination of Arnett, Poehler and Fischer had and how they needed about a thousand times more. The film should have just been this trifecta, instead of the idiocy of Jon Heder ruminating through my eyes for an hour and a half. The Iron Lotus was still one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen, though.P.S. - Jenna Fischer was insanely sexy.",5,0,0,8 January 2008
Ocean's Thirteen," Almost as fun as the first.
","Nothing could really live up to the magic of the first film in the franchise, but this one definitely comes close. It's a hell of a lot of fun with the same witty, hilarious style that I loved in the first two but this one raises the stakes just a bit. The heist is bigger...but they also aren't really stealing anything for themselves so it's a bit anticlimactic. This one is probably the most original of the series and also the most outrageous. I mean Casey Affleck freaking out and starting a worker's strike at a Mexican dice-making factory? And then Scott Caan being sent to stop him only to be seen throwing a Molotov cocktail at the police? It doesn't get much better than that, and I was laughing until the tears came. The cast is brilliant as always with everyone from George Clooney and Brad Pitt to Casey Affleck and Eddie Izzard delivering knockout performances. Al Pacino is the perfect addition as the villain this time around and he plays the part like he was made for it. It's clear that everyone had a lot of fun making Ocean's Thirteen and that sheds through to a wild, hilarious and immensely enjoyable ride for the viewer.",9,0,1,8 January 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Ben Affleck crafts a disturbing emotional adaptation.
","After a decade of critically disgraced performances and brutal public humiliation year after year, Ben Affleck took a well deserved break from the Hollywood scene. This year he came back, but instead of taking the spotlight by starring in a film, he went behind the scenes and opted to direct his first feature film. Taking an example from another actor turned director, a little independent man named Clint Eastwood, he decided to adapt a novel written by Mystic River author Dennis Lehane. On the surface, Gone Baby Gone tells the story of a missing child and the two private investigators who are hired to find her. The story transforms into a highly disturbing tale of selfish, terrifying characters and the fact that no matter what people never change.In deciding who to play the leading role of the intelligent, reserved, moral and slightly naive Patrick Kenzie, Ben looked no further than his brother Casey. Initially this may seem like a bad idea with lots of sibling tension on the set, but the decision couldn't have been a better one. After years of under-the-radar brilliance, Casey gets to show his acting genius in the leading role of a powerful, emotionally drenching work. I love the fact that everyone is finally getting to see what a true wonder this young actor is, with talent greater than the majority of actors I've ever seen no matter what their age. He's getting a large amount of critical recognition for his flawless turn in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, but he is almost as exceptional in this one. Counterbalancing Kenzie is his mature and equally intelligent partner and lover, Angie Gennaro played by the beautiful Michelle Monaghan. The two of them grew up on the streets of Boston and therefore are pursued to use their relationships with the criminals involved to help find the men who kidnapped this little girl. This leads the audience on a highly engaging and very disturbing journey through the lowest forms of scum in the Boston population and a climax that is just as surprising as it is haunting.The second half starts with another missing person's case and Kenzie discovers something that forces him to bring back Detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris), a character who he didn't end on the best of terms with in the first act. In an act of high tension and in the face of an ultimate evil, Kenzie makes a decision that he immediately regrets and is the first time he really matures in the film and falls into a moral crisis as he witnesses the true personalities of those around him and re-evaluates everything in his life. A conversation with Bressant soon after this act provides a stage for Ed Harris' remarkable display of talent in one of his career best performances. However a revelation Kenzie makes during this conversation leads us into an even darker world of corruption within the police, back to the victims of the original crime and a lesson that sometimes the most morally righteous can people can do terrifying things if they believe it is for the greater good.Another stirring revelation leads Affleck to the film's second big twist that I didn't see coming from a mile away. He finds moral corruption, again 'for the greater good', in the most unexpected place and is led to one of the most arduous and unimaginable decisions I've ever seen put on film. I won't spoil anything, but it's safe to say that this was the first and only time I've ever put myself in the shoes of a character on screen and wondered what I would do in his situation. It's a decision I don't think I could ever make, and one of the most painful scenes of the year. Watching Affleck's expression and the pain in his eyes is truly gutwrenching. In his decision we eventually see that even in the most emotionally straining situations and no matter how much they say they will, people never change. I found that to be the final moral of the film, and the ending was haunting, cathartic and emotionally painful as we see Kenzie living with the fact that maybe his decision was the wrong one but he still tries to do the morally just thing in the end.Ben Affleck has come back strong to the Hollywood scene by avoiding public humiliation and realizing that the film would be miles superior if he directed instead of starred in it. There is one minor flaw in this feature, and that is that it felt to me like three different films. There are two clear cut endings, but the film picks back up afterwards on the road to the final conclusion. With each new story comes depth and disturbance from the characters and overall plot, so one can easily ignore this very minuscule flaw. His casting was flawless from the stunning magnificence of Casey Affleck to the Oscar-worthy Ed Harris to the critically praised grieving mother Amy Ryan. Gone Baby Gone is certainly one of the best films this year, and I hope it's not forgotten come awards season, particularly in the form of it's reborn director and flawless leading man (as well as the rest of this multi-talented cast). A deeply disturbing and thoroughly engaging picture that is sure to stay on my mind for days.",10,244,308,22 October 2007
The Godfather: Part II," Sensational.
","Keeps the authentic, beautiful and rich feeling of the first film, while adding a level of intensity and interest throughout. The idea of producing parallel stories depicting the rise of a young Vito Corleone (played to perfection by Robert De Niro) and the loneliness and betrayal of Michael Corleone (the subtle and frighteningly intense Al Pacino) was a brilliant one. However, this is where the majority of the film's flaws lie. In creating these two separate stories, they made one much more interesting than the other. When watching the slow turn of paranoia and danger in Michael's life, all I can manage to think about is what will happen next in Vito Corleone's rise to becoming the Godfather. Either way, these are two of the strongest and most complex characters of all time. Vito loses his father, brother and mother to the same man who he luckily escapes from. He gains a family and rises to power, murdering another Don in the process in one of the most intensely suspenseful scenes of all time, and returns to confront this now bitter and alone man.The death of Don Ciccio is one of the strongest scenes of the film, and certainly portrays how much more brilliant De Niro is when he's playing quiet strength instead of shouting at the top of his lungs. In the late Don Ciccio, we also see a parallel to the story of Michael Corleone throughout the film. A man who is simply trying to keep his family in tact, while remaining at the same level of respect and power as his late father. Instead, he falls into a world of betrayal on all fronts and the constant paranoia of being at the top of the food chain. He begins to feel as though he is the strongest man, waiting for the inevitable opportunity for another to bring him to the grave (just like what Vito had previously done many years ago). This leads to a life of utter alienation, even from his family. Three images in this film portray the most sympathetic form of isolation in cinematic history (Michael looking out the window as Fredo sails away, Michael sitting in the park bench alone at the end, and Michael sitting alone at the dinner table while everyone else joyously surprises Vito on his birthday). We see the loneliness and rejection of a man who lives his life for his family, but eventually loses them all. The final dinner scene has so much complexity it left me stunned well after the credits rolled. Definitely a film that has earned it's iconic status, featuring two performances that rightfully lit the fuel for the two most acclaimed careers the film industry has ever seen.",9,0,1,9 January 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Continues in the grand tradition of the series.
","Continues with the tradition of the series so far. Once again, the series excels at being an intellectual, action-packed, edge-of-your-seat thriller that starts with a bang and never lets up. It's a gritty, stylized espionage thriller that is certainly one of the most exhilarating and visceral experiences I've had in recent memory. Greengrass implies the 'in your face' techniques that he used in Supremacy which makes the action seem authentic and really puts you into the point of view of Bourne, getting your pulse racing and your eyes completely attached to the screen.The cast is all great, as usual. Damon and Allen add the intellect and commanding power to the film. It was great to see Julia Stiles getting a more pivotal role, since I felt she was pretty underused in the previous installments. The addition of David Straithairn and, more importantly, Albert Finney was absolutely brilliant. They just continued the tradition of brilliant, insanely commanding actors playing the generic 'hunt him down' role. They certainly added a lot to what could have been very flat characters. The style used is gritty, suave and very authentic. However, it can become a bit too stylized at times. It can cut too quickly and zoom in and out and tilt all over the place, and the editing could be pretty sloppy from time to time. Other than that though, I don't really have much to complain about. If you liked the first two installments, you'll surely be pleased by this one. If you didn't, then this obviously isn't for you. I was a big fan.",9,1,3,8 January 2008
Fargo," Gets better with each viewing.
","The Coen brothers seamlessly weave the hilarity of American plainness within a story of a greedy, selfish man who hatches a plot that goes completely awry in this masterpiece. They capture the dreary scenery of this winter plain-land flawlessly mix the dark humor with a pretty violent story, all the while keeping their tongue firmly planted in their cheek. It pokes fun at these characters and their lifestyle while also creating a magnificent story out of them. You can see that the Coens truly loved these people and put dedication into creating this world (that was inspired by their actual life in Minnesota) and had a lot of fun mocking it all while paying tribute to this sort of sub-culture. The score and cinematography are easily some of the best I've ever seen (as is the film). It's also creepy how much I relate to Gaear Grimsrud. I feel like we have so much in common and were I in his situation I would act the same way. He also managed to draw the most laughs out of me. It should also be mentioned that the performances from the four main actors (McDormand, Macy, Buscemi, Stormare) are all grand. It truly is a film that only gets better and better with each viewing. This was my tenth and I've never loved it more.",10,0,0,23 January 2008
The Aviator," Marvelous.
","When it comes to film, my love is primarily focused on two things. I can be swayed and amazed by brilliant metaphors and symbolisms and fantastic technical aspects, but a film is nothing to me without two key ingredients. First, I need power in the performances. Be it subtle inner pain or explosive intensity, it's practically impossible for me to love a film if it doesn't feature some great performances or at least a brilliant one in the lead. Secondly, and most importantly, is the story. The thing I love most about film is the ability it has to immerse me into a story and take me on a journey outside of my own world. Be it through wild comedic adventure, an action-filled extravaganza, a deep, emotional story about characters or a powerful epic drama, I have to love a story to love a film. Luckily for me, The Aviator features a magnificent story of a very complex individual and is anchored by one of the finest performances I've ever seen in the form of Leonardo DiCaprio. While it does have flawless technical aspects (including a score that never ceases to amaze), the film is founded on these two elements. As you well know, Scorsese's film tells the story of the infamous Howard Hughes who led a life full of beautiful women and a huge amount of money to do whatever he pleased with. Hughes decided to put this money towards his huge ambition and his love for film and, more importantly, aviation.As the film begins we see him working on his debut feature, Hell's Angels, which proudly portrayed his love for the sky and the planes that glide through it. Throughout the production he's met with an enormous amount of obstacles from money troubles to plane troubles to having to reshoot the entire picture because by the time it was finished, the era of silent films was over. We progress through the prominent stages of Howard's life and along the way, Scorsese shows us everything about his life from his relationships with beauties like Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) to his battles with severe mental issues ranging from OCD to bipolar disorder and potentially paranoid-schizophrenia; and all of this is portrayed exceptionally while in the background his aviation empire rises, falls and rises back again and his film career is met with constant turmoil. Scorsese manages everything perfectly so that the viewer is always aware of what's currently on screen, what's happening that we aren't seeing and what has driven the story up to the point we are currently at. It flows at a perfect pace, never going to quickly for the viewer to catch up and never dragging throughout it's almost three hour running time.Scorsese's direction is perfect as he creates, in my opinion, what is easily his best film since Taxi Driver and one of the finest films of the decade. The film shares a lot of similarities to Scorsese's other widely acclaimed biopic, Raging Bull, and one of the key similarities is that the film is anchored by a wildly intense, unstoppable performance; in this case coming from Leonardo DiCaprio. Taking on someone as complex as Howard Hughes would be an immensely difficult task for any actor, especially one as young as DiCaprio, but Scorsese firmly believed in his abilities (the two previously worked together on Gangs of New York) and his decision pays off in a way that I couldn't have imagined in my wildest dreams. DiCaprio's power is stunning, his absorption into the character goes beyond anything one could have expected and he ultimately creates one of the finest performances I've ever seen. A raw, brutally intense portrayal that perfectly encompasses the legend that is Howard Hughes in a film that tells his story admirably and never cuts corners. Scorsese and DiCaprio both create what is bound to be one of the highlights of their careers and certainly is one of the highlights of this incredible decade of film.",9,7,11,9 January 2008
The Bourne Identity," A revolution for the espionage thriller.
","It really takes the espionage thriller to a new, and much superior level. Instead of ridiculously over the top action with whatever the highest form of special effects are available at the time, Bourne is very low-key with natural and realistic action, and no visual effects. That's one of the main reasons why I love it so much. It feels authentic. Sure the backplot is a little far-fetched, but the way everything plays out from it is so natural and realistic that I'm just blown away. Damon is brilliant, as usual, and plays the most convincing amnesiac I've ever seen on film (eat it Memento fanboys). Franka Potente is gorgeous and also very natural. Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are easily two of the best and possibly the two most commanding actors working right now, and putting them together on screen was just an explosion waiting to happen. The casting of this film was brilliant. The car chase is possibly the greatest of all time (only Supremacy's can top it) and I always admire the use of Paul Oakenfold's 'Ready, Steady, Go' in a film, although Collateral did use it better. My only big complaint about the film is the complete change in the story from the novel, although I do understand why it was done. They had to translate the Cold War era of the novel to modern times, and it loses a lot of it's details in the process but they replaced them nice and neatly. They keep the central plot the same, just change around a bulk of the details. If you hadn't read the novels, you wouldn't notice the flaw at all and think that it was very properly handled. Very entertaining and very authentic. One of the best films of the weak 2002 for sure.",9,2,2,9 January 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A great adaptation.
","One of my all-time favorite literary tales, The Fellowship of the Ring is transformed on film into a sprawling, epic fantasy tale. The action is supremely well done. I doubt I've ever seen more well rehearsed and orchestrated fight scenes, especially on such a mass scale (the ones in the next two films are even better) and the film has some of the best art direction, makeup, cinematography and costume design I've ever seen. They're truly phenomenal. It does drag a little in the beginning, but it's worth it to get us into the story. My only other big complaint is that some of the scenes are just a little over the top, Galadriel's freak out being the best example (a little bit of training for Blanchett for The Golden Age). The performances are relatively good all around with a few being phenomenal (Viggo Mortensen and Ian McKellan), a few being great (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) and one being very poor (Elijah Wood). But overall, they're good. This film is one founded on it's story. If you don't like the story, you won't like the film. Personally I adore the entire plot spanning all three novels/films and Jackson perfectly captured this first act.",9,0,0,31 January 2008
28 Weeks Later," Just another example of a sequel losing any flare from the original.
","Four years ago 28 Days Later delivered a much needed revolution to the zombie flick. It's use of hand-held cameras, rapidly caffeinated zombies and pure isolation created a sense of dread and terror that I hadn't felt in years. It was widely acclaimed and became one of the best horror films in decades for the sole reason that it was such a fresh relief from the serial killer-of-the-week cheap thrill rides that had been pumping out since the early '90s. The film became a welcome relief of originality in a genre that had quickly become stale. Of course in creating a sequel, it loses all of this freshness.28 Weeks Later plays out as just another unneeded sequel to an already closed film. We see that everything is perfectly fine; London is quarantined and the virus is contained. Of course nothing can be that simple for long. The foolishness of children leads to a relapse of the virus in the American militarized zone and another outbreak is quickly on hand. As the zombies increase amazingly in numbers, the soldiers get orders to shoot everyone; infected or not. They need to contain any chance of the virus getting out, and the ultimate decision is to firebomb the entire district. In the midst of all this mayhem is a possible cure to the disease. A cure ironically found in the one person who introduced the infection back into the public after months of safety. This cure simply would've been unnecessary had it not been for the blind foolishness of children and inefficiency of a government that thinks they have control over everything. The desperate attempt at escape for the cure, living in the bodies of the two foolish children and led by an American soldier and an American military nurse, is the main plot of this seemingly insignificant story.In turn the film ends up as an attempt at making some extra cash from the success of it's predecessor and fails miserably at trying to have any sort of unique quality. The camera-work from the first is thrown out the window, but a unique style of a faux-Greengrass/Mann cinematography pours the 'shaky-cam' on far too thick and does nothing but add nausea and confusion to what's happening on screen (the same exact thing that happened back in Sunshine, and just like Sunshine this film thrives on making the phrase 'style over substance' a gross understatement). This is a film that relies on the ambiance of fear and excitement that it attempts to create, but unfortunately it doesn't do a great job at that either. I will admit that it was entertaining for the most part and that the majority of the cast was excellent (particularly Rose Byrne and Imogen Poots) but the film just lost any kind of freshness that 28 Days had obtained therefore making it nothing more than another modern horror sequel that is completely pointless. The completely unbelievable ending (a soldier spends the entire film saying that he won't bring the kids on the helicopter, but then he lets them on without his buddy solider? Right.) that further provides the commentary of the foolishness of children, shows the virus spreading globally (in this case all the way to Paris) and practically insures another unnecessary, irrelevant sequel. Eventually we'll be able to see 28 Centuries Later. Zombies in space? I'm there.I'd like to take time in this review to discuss my lovely sweetheart Rose Byrne. It really is coming to the point where she needs to get her role-choosing cap fitted, because this is becoming ridiculous. She is one of the most talented actresses I've ever seen and she constantly chooses these big mainstream pictures that range from terrible to barely above average, and her talent goes completely unnoticed. Big-budget features that put her in minuscule supporting roles while they pour and pour and pour the disgusting style that they try to create over the audiences head. It's revolting. She delivers one of the finest performances of all time in The Goddess of 1967 and since then it's been one big-budgeted stylized piece of tripe after the other (with the exceptions of The Dead Girl and Marie Antoinette). Ms. Byrne always delivers a knockout performance, even in something like Sunshine, but her brilliant work falls into the abyss unless you're precisely looking for it do to the disgusting need for stylistic attention these self-obsessed directors have.",5,0,1,8 January 2008
21," Massively entertaining.
","It doesn't aim to be anything incredible and just allows itself to be a lot of fun with a great cast. Jim Sturgess again shows some great talent as the film showcases his naturalism and diversity. He does a superb job of leading the story and is really proving to be a true rising star. Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne are great to watch as the veterans of the film whose pasts lead to some twists and turns at the end that I really didn't see coming. But neither overstep their parts like some big stars do in supporting roles; they let Sturgess make the film the entertaining up-and-down story that it is. Kate Bosworth is incredibly sexy in a rather underwritten role. In a small role, Aaron Yoo again delivers a hilarious performance as he did in last year's Disturbia. It's a little too long and I didn't really buy the fact that everything works out so well in the end, but overall it's just an enjoyable little film that demonstrates the strong talent of a great young actor.",4,1,4,31 March 2008
The Shining," This is how you create ambiance.
","Kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film. Mainly through cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start. It really is this flawless ambiance that makes The Shining the masterpiece that it is, in my eyes. Of course it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. A frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be nice, but it's easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant. Plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).",10,3,5,3 March 2008
Wanted," Very fun.
","It's a lot of fun and that's really all it aims to be. James McAvoy basically proves that he can do anything, as the young, pale Scottish boy turns himself into a believable action star. Angelina Jolie is painfully sexy and perfectly emotionless. My only real complaint is that sometimes it feels like it tries way too hard to be different. Sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't but the majority of the stuff falls into the former camp so there isn't a lot to complain about. The dialogue is a little silly at times and some of the action fringes on being almost too ridiculous but overall it's really just a lot of adrenaline-fueled fun.",2,2,6,28 June 2008
Disturbia," A simple, entertaining thriller.
","Obviously it takes a lot of elements from Rear Window, but it really isn't the complete ripoff that everyone makes it out to be. This one mixes in some very likable humor and adds a lot of elements to make it more relatable for teenagers. It does a good job of reflecting a teen's life, especially what would happen if one was completely cut off from the technological-based world of today. Shia LaBeouf was surprisingly good and I found him really likable. The ending was a bit clichéd and there were some elements throughout the film that I wasn't a huge fan of but overall this was a very likable, engaging and enjoyable thriller. A pleasant surprise.",7,0,0,8 January 2008
Edward Scissorhands," One of the best and most heartbreaking films of all time.
","A hauntingly poetic, dark fairy tale filled with fantastic humor, amazing performances and possibly the most heartbreaking romance of all time. Everything about this film is perfect. Johnny Depp plays arguably his most bizarre and surreal character, which is a lot for him, and he portrays it perfectly. For his most bizarre character, Depp is at his most reserved. The story is ultimately one of a man who wants nothing more than to be accepted and belong in this happy, seemingly Utopian suburbia.Of course the tragedy of the story is that, nearing the completion of his invention, Edward's inventor/father died tragically before he could finish his hands. So we see society's typical reaction to something new and bizarre. At first everyone is overwhelmingly interested by this new man and want to know as much about him as possible. We see his many unique talents (gardening, for instance) and for the first time in his life Edward feels like he belongs somewhere.At the end of the first act, we are overjoyed by his acceptance and happiness in this world. And then the introduction of Kim leads to a slow, inevitable downfall of this tragic character. The scum of the Earth is portrayed through Kim's boyfriend Jim and the combination of his jealousy of Edward with Edward's infatuation/devotion to Kim creates some of the most painful scenes of all time. Jim takes advantage of Edward's lock-picking abilities and in an unhappy accident he gets thrown in jail, but his devotion to Kim means that he won't tell the truth; that it wasn't his fault. So now society turns. Some make up false stories of how he tried to rape them, even though it was her who forced herself upon Edward's innocence; but everyone turns their interest and adoration of Edward into spiteful fear and detestment. Everyone except for Kim, the golden light in this pathetically revolting neighborhood. We fall in love with her, just as Edward does, as she leaves her boyfriend and tries to do all she can to make Edward feel accepted.But society won't have this. They turn every small mishap into the apocalypse and want to bring down the man they all admired so dearly a few days prior. This isn't even the most tragic element of this story. The most painful scene of all time is unleashed as Edward and Kim are standing alone in a room. 'Hold me' Kim asks the man with scissors for hands; she wants comfort from the fear and chaos of the world outside but the only person who can give her this comfort is unable to because he could hurt her simply by touching her. It brings more tears down my face than I can ever remember happening. Such a painful scene in a heartbreaking film.The finale is just as heartbreaking. Kim is a very old woman, almost on her death bed, and after years of not visiting Edward in his castle on top of the hill she realizes that it is too late to do so. Her heart crumbles before us as she makes the painful decision to let Edward remember her as the adorable and beautiful young woman she was; not the old lady she has become. Probably the most painful film I've ever seen, yet it still gives me a sense of pure joy every time I watch it. Maybe it has something to do with Danny Elfman's flawlessly gorgeous score, that I've now decided is my favorite of all time. Maybe it has something to do with Johnny Depp's uniquely outrageous performance. Whatever it is, Edward Scissorhands is a film that I will always hold close to my heart, no matter how much it breaks it.",10,5,7,8 January 2008
In the Name of the Father," A powerful story with one of the best performances of all time.
","An emotionally wrenching and immensely powerful true story of an innocent man who is put in prison for fifteen years, after being forced by interrogators to sign a confession out of the threat that they'd kill his father if he didn't, and this man's fight to clear his name and his father's. Due to an incident with the IRA, Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) moves to London and after a chance opportunity to rob a prostitute he returns to his home in Belfast, coincidentally the day after a huge bombing committed by the IRA in London. His best friend, who was with him that night, Paul Hill is arrested and after being forced to confess with a gun in his mouth he lists Conlon and two other friends as members of the IRA. Now known as the Guildford Four, these innocent people were all sentenced to very lengthy jail sentences and, after painful torture, the government plants false accusations on members of Conlons' family including his father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite). Gerry has to deal with pent-up aggression that he has built up against his father for years while also trying to survive in a British prison as an accused IRA member.Even after Joe McAndrew (Don Baker) is arrested and confesses to the police that he was behind the Guildford bombing and the people they have in prison were innocent, Gerry and Giuseppe remain in prison suffering more and more by the day. Eventually Giuseppe begins working with Gareth Pierce (Emma Thompson) to investigate their case and prove the innocence of the Conlons and the other members of the Guildford Four. After Giuseppe dies of natural causes, Gerry gains a new drive to prove their innocence and takes over the task of working with Gareth. The film is a powerful character study of a man put under unimaginable circumstances and has the discipline to rise up and, along with Pierce, prove the innocence of not only himself but of his father and the other three members of the Guildford Four. It's an immensely heart-wrenching, emotional story that had me in tears several times throughout.Highlighting this sensational film is Daniel Day-Lewis who further proves that he is the greatest actor of all time and delivers what I believe is the best performance of his career. Taking on the role of Gerry Conlon requires the ability to subtly flow from a naive, immature young man to a disciplined adult working to clear the name of his father. Along that journey there are several highly emotional scenes that could have felt melodramatic or silly if another actor were portraying the man, but Day-Lewis brings a power to Conlon that no one else could. His brilliance is unparalleled. Pete Postlethwaite and Emma Thompson also deliver fantastic performances that rank among the best of the 90s. In the Name of the Father is a phenomenal film that studies the torture that one man had to go through due to the government and the journey he took to clear his name and the name of his father. It's the best film of 1993, in my eyes and Day-Lewis' portrayal is very high among the best performances of all time.",10,5,7,30 December 2007
Ocean's Eleven," Some of the most fun I've ever had.
","Pure entertainment at it's finest. I didn't experience a single dull moment and I never felt that the film dragged at all. A perfect blend of humor, tension and vibrant action. The performances are all wonderful and they blend together seamlessly. The chemistry between everyone involved is extremely palpable and plain warming. The entire style of the film is very quick-paced and lively, bringing the viewer on a wild ride of hilarious antics and vibrant adventure. The chemistry of the actors really makes the film what it is. You feel like these eleven people could actually be working together, sharing this close bond. I'm a big fan; one of the most entertaining films to watch.",9,1,4,8 January 2008
The Duchess," One of the best period dramas in ages.
","A brilliant ensemble highlights this period drama about one of history's most interesting members of royalty. Director Saul Dibb does an excellent job of creating this extensive, intricate universe and the cinematography and score are the best of the year, but it's really Keira Knightley's performance that drives the film to the level of greatness it has achieved. She is absolutely phenomenal. She's never had a performance with this much fury, both external and internal, and she nails the delicacies of this without a second of hesitation. She knows exactly when to bottle up the pain and express it through her eyes and when to let all of the pent-up aggression out without ever going over the top. A shatteringly emotional performance that remains impressive all the way to the end. I'm tempted to call it her best performance, but I can't manage to say it's better than her work in Pride & Prejudice. Still, it's a close number two in her career. Of course she's not the only member of the cast, and the rest of the ensemble all does a great job of supporting her. The most impressive of that supporting cast would be Ralph Fiennes, whose piercing eyes shook me to the core whenever he came on screen. Two perfect performances in the best period film about royalty in quite some time.",9,1,2,24 October 2008
Quantum of Solace," Almost as good as the flawless Casino Royale.
","In 2006, James Bond was reinvented. After four decades of him being displayed as a suave, cheesy and one-dimensional spy, we finally saw a darker side of the man. In Casino Royale Bond was a brutal, vicious bastard with a heart colder than ice. But that changed when Vesper Lynd came into the mix and melted this man's heart. For the first time in history, we saw a Bond in love, and were then witness to the tragedy that came when he found out that she betrayed him and he had to watch her die.For the first time in the franchise, Quantum of Solace is a direct sequel to it's predecessor. In fact, it begins almost immediately after Royale as Bond is in the midst of escaping with the man he found and captured at the end of the previous film. It's clear from the beginning that he is even more ruthless now and he's going to bring down anyone who stands in the way of his revenge. He's not 'out for blood' in the classic sense, but he won't think twice about tossing a man through a window and bleeding him out on his patio if the man attacks him. He wants to find whoever is ultimately responsible for the death of the woman he loved and, in the end, the person who allowed him to feel and then ripped that love away. Once again, this newly reinvented Bond goes beyond the rest of the franchise by pouring a strong amount of true emotion into this story.A lot of the emotion on this new Bond comes with the help of Daniel Craig, who gives another flawless performance in the lead role. Last time he went through a range of emotions, but now he is just a wrecking ball of rage driving towards the people who hurt him. It's a visceral portrayal that, just like in Royale, shook me to the core. However the most surprising display of internal pain and heartache in this film didn't come from Bond himself, but from the woman who commands him. M usually takes a huge backseat to the action in the series and only pops in once or twice throughout the film to say 'Oh, Bond, you silly boy.' and then disappear. But she's given a lot more depth this time around and Judi Dench takes full advantage of this opportunity to pour emotion into a mostly underused character. At the beginning of the film, one of her men turns out to be a mole for QUANTUM, the organization that they are hunting but have no knowledge of, and he tries to kill her and Bond. This results in a phenomenal chase sequence as Bond chases after the man, but the even more interesting result of the scene is the impact it has on M. We get to see her as a fragile woman who has spent years putting her heart and soul into her job who is shattered when she is almost murdered by a man she trusted to be her own bodyguard. I loved getting the chance to see what's been boiling underneath M's surface all of these years.Of course with every Bond film comes a Bond villain and here we get the cunning, malicious and intelligent Dominic Greene played with a quiet fury by Mathieu Amalric. I loved this character as, like everything else with the new Bond, he isn't typical to the series. He's not a recycled psychopath with a scar or a cat, to try and make him more menacing than he needs to be. Amalric embodies this man brilliantly by showing from the start that he will do anything to get what he wants and anyone who stands in his way will catch a bullet. His subtle nature and refusal to ever be extravagant or go over-the-top made him all the more frightening as a villain.In Casino Royale, Eva Green's Vesper Lynd evolved the standard Bond girl that we get to see every film. She was different because she actually got Bond to fall in love with her. She wasn't just a tramp who fell for his charm and was tossed out of his room in the morning. In Quantum of Solace we see another evolution of this usually one-dimensional character with Olga Kurylenko's excellent portrayal of Camille, a woman out for vengeance of her own. Unlike the majority of Bond girls, Camille is a fully developed character with her own story of revenge that is displayed throughout the course of the film. Kurylenko's pure rage and desperate need for revenge against a man who killed her family and burned her house down around her as a child, is a surprisingly interesting subplot to this story and seeing how her and Bond relate to one another while trying to use Greene to get to the people they want is one of the most compelling aspects of this story.As with every Bond film, there is beautiful scenery and masterfully extensive action scenes all the way through and they've never been better than they are in Solace. All of the action is brutal and whether it's a fistfight, a chase in the sea or in the sky, or a fight with an axe while a hotel is burning down around them, every scene is wildly commanding and had me on the edge of my seat. Daniel Craig's Bond is a much more compelling character than Bond has ever been and this tragically vicious story is what has made both of these films among my favorites of the decade. Quantum of Solace is a film that, while not being as epically flawless as Casino Royale, is still a masterpiece according to this viewer.",10,7,16,17 November 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A Shakespearean tragedy with one of the finest performances in history.
","Despite some pointless narration (and irrelevantly blurred editing during the scenes with this narration) and the complete mistreatment of one of the finest actresses of the decade, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is easily one of the finest modern films around and certainly one of the best of the year. It plays as a Shakespearean tragedy instead of an outlandish, action-filled western that one would expect when hearing the name Jesse James. Featuring some of the best performances of the decade, the film is a wonderful mix of subtle and emotional heartache with biting realistic tension and a beautifully flawed character that everyone can relate to in some way. Slowly the film builds a tension and knowing dissension towards the inevitable downfall of Mr. James. It's a heartbreaking story of one man trying to be remembered and another knowing a betrayal is quickly coming upon him.A contrast between the main characters Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) is presented throughout and really shows the truth that Ford is exactly the same as James, just at an earlier stage in his life. Jesse was the youngest of three boys and rose above all of them to be the most renowned outlaw in American history. He murdered and stole, but gained nothing but respect and admiration from those who heard the stories of his crimes. Of course with all of this fame, and the bounty of men he's had work with him and in his trust, Jesse knew that a betrayal was soon coming. He averted one before, but he can see the end in sight and this time, he is welcoming it instead of trying to fight it.This portrayal of James is one of the many things that make this film so brilliant. He's a melancholy, brooding, bipolar and enraged mess. A man who knows the end is approaching, but has come to a point in his life where he doesn't see any reason to try and stop it. We see him for how he truly was, instead of the gun-slinging charismatic outlaw that James is constantly portrayed as time and time again. This deeply heartbreaking man is perfectly personified by Pitt's award-worthy performance. We see a side of the light, breezy Brad Pitt that I personally could never have imagined. He presents so much pain and anguish behind those steely blues, that my heart stopped every time he started intently with his eyes ever so lightly filling with tears.I have no hesitation in calling Robert Ford the most tragic character in cinematic history. He is the youngest of five brothers, and all day he gets picked on and disrespected so when he sees another man who's the youngest of a number of brothers, he begins to idolize him. When he finally gets the chance to meet his hero, and work alongside him, his tendency to give a bad first impression (albeit he is a bit eerie with his strong admiration of the James boys) leads to more humiliation from the man he considered to be everything he wanted to grow up into. Obviously this leads the young man into spite and bitter insecurity. He becomes a wreck, but in this state of depression he is able to finally realize his true feelings and express them to the world. Due to this, Bob begins to get more respect and fear from those around him, and the Sheriff decides to capitalize on this bitterness by enlisting Bob in a sort-of undercover mission to arrest James, though everyone knows there is no way to arrest the man. It can only end in the death of one of the men.Of course the title, and any kind of history book, reveals who the dead man is and Ford assumes that this will lead to him becoming a legend in the same way that Jesse was. An icon on the morally right side, instead of as a criminal. However he is gravely wrong and he's met with more disrespect and tales of him being the biggest coward in American history to match Jesse's status as the biggest and most respected criminal. James was an icon and Ford was just the snake in the grass who stabbed him in the back. This undoubtedly brings more depression to Robert; he killed his hero for fame and was forever remembered as a coward who betrayed an icon. And then another man gets the idea that Robert had; he was going to murder someone infamous in order to be remembered and with this second murder ends the tragedy that is Robert Ford's life. The man who wanted nothing more than to be Jesse James, and became his killer.Casey Affleck's performance is the stuff of cinematic legend. His dynamic brilliance, deeply emotional strength and powerful absorption into this fatally flawed character combine to create what is easily one of the best performances I've ever seen and quite simply the best performance of the year so far. I've been a fan of this underrated genius for a long time now, and this performance is his best by far and is sure to get him a lot of attention come awards season; I could even see an Oscar in his future. He completely steals the show from Pitt, who still turns in an excellent portrayal, and perfectly embodies a character who just breaks my heart. Casey creates such a nice demeanor and personality for this dangerously awkward young man that makes him one of the most complex and, as I said before, easily the most tragic character in the history of film in my eyes. A true revelation to modern acting and proof that when you get the right role in the right film, you can take it all the way to the top.",9,39,63,14 October 2007
Revolutionary Road," An absolute masterpiece.
","Sam Mendes' masterpiece Revolutionary Road doesn't take any time to introduce us to it's characters or show us how they met and fell in love. From the very first scene, we know who Frank and April Wheeler are and why they are so tragically unhappy. The Wheelers thought that they were special, somehow superior to the drones of classic suburban America that they began living among. Perhaps it was the realization that they were living such a dull, unimpressive life that made them feel superior, but in the opening stages of the film they slowly realize that they have stopped being outsiders and instead have become just another uninteresting couple in this uninteresting world. To open themselves back up to life and that superiority, April creates a dream fantasy to move to Paris and they both buy into it for as long as they can.This dream of Paris, however, is just a band-aid for a wound that won't stop bleeding. For a little while they live on a high, basking in the glow that this fantasy has brought them. But soon they realize that they can never escape this disaster of an existence that they accidentally slipped into too long ago for them to even remember what made them so interesting in the first place. Their despondency with life quickly turns into aggressive hatred towards each other as they fall further and further apart in a series of brutal arguments that only get worse and worse. The tragedy of this film, and these characters, is that in the end they don't hate each other. Frank and April Wheeler love each other deeply, but that love is so strong that the only way to distract themselves from a life they never dreamed of living is to turn such a strong emotion into unimaginable hatred towards each other. They are in love and want to be happy together, but everything in their lives succeeds in driving them further and further apart into an ending that shook me to the core.Of course, when it comes down to it, this tragic tale of suburban misery is an actor's showcase. And boy, what a showcase it is. I've seen a few people express hate for the film and it's performances because they feel that it was all too melodramatic and scenery chewing. But I personally think that's the genius behind these performances. Not because the actors are melodramatic, but because the characters themselves make their own arguments melodramatic and explosive just so that they can feel something. These people are craving for something that they can never have, a kind of life you would see in the movies. And if they can't have a happy life where they travel around Paris having fun, they can at least feel alive in the most tragic way possible by taking out their aggression on each other at every turn. All of the shouting and flailing of the arms, I think that was all in the realism of the characters and their need to shout louder and be more theatric than the other person. They used this explosiveness to establish dominance in the argument and relationship and in that respect, the performances were flawless.Leonardo DiCaprio has really impressed me a few times this decade, but his performance in this picture makes his past work look like child's play. Hell, he makes the rest of the actors in this piece seem like amateurs. He steals every second of this film with an explosive, emotionally powerful performance that served to devastate, terrify and move me all at the same time. A brutal portrayal of an ultimately sympathetic and tragic character and without a doubt one of the best performances of the year. Even though DiCaprio completely steals the film, that's not to say that the rest of the performances are anything but sensational. Kate Winslet is the perfect match for his talent in the arguments of these characters and each of them provide their own level of internal fear and external explosiveness. Michael Shannon has been an actor who I've admired quite a bit over the past few years, stealing scenes in all of his films while he went unnoticed and underrated by the world at large. Needless to say, when I found out that he had a performance with Oscar buzz in a prestige picture like this (a performance that would eventually earn him an actual Oscar nomination), my expectations were pretty high off the bat. He took those expectations, ran with them, and then shattered anything I could have expected from him. His performance is absolutely frightening and I couldn't be more pleased that his talent is getting recognized all over the place, especially by the Academy themselves. His explosive argument with DiCaprio's character unsettled me in a way that few films ever have, and that was based entirely on the flawless performances from the two actors.",10,1,2,24 January 2009
Across the Universe," Engrossing, energetic and flawless.
","No matter how hard I try, there is no word to describe the uplifting, emotional and truly sensational journey that this film took me on. It's simply indescribable. From the opening scene of waves crashing on a shore mixed in with newspaper headlines, a vague trace of the film's most powerful moment where the two lovers are ripped apart by police and protest and the classic 'Helter Skelter', it is clear that Taymor is going to take us on an epic journey of revolution, charisma and entrancing sequences of Beatles brilliance. Every single scene is so vibrant, fresh and unique.Taymor manages to keep the integrity of each work of lyrical art, while also adding her own distinctive touch of excellence to it. Each sequence is powerful, enthralling and utterly joyous. I really can't put the sensation this film gave me into words, but it's the most wonderful feeling I've ever experienced. And the most remarkable thing about it is that this feeling wasn't just during one particular moment or musical number, it hit me strong in the opening sequence and carried me on a pillow of divine euphoria unlike any experience I've ever had.The love story that plays out over the entire film is beautiful, painful and riveting. Both of these young adults are unique and beautiful revolutionaries, but they take their protests in very different forms. Eventually this drives them apart, and in an attempt to reunite we experience the film's most brilliant but painfully heartbreaking scene. As Lucy is being pulled away by the police during an immense protest, Jude fights his way through the crowd and officers to get to her. As they reach for one another, a club hits Jude across the face and he goes down. This all plays out under the cathartic collision of 'Helter Skelter' and 'Across the Universe' while we also see Lucy's brother, the resisted soldier, quickly falling into madness under the extreme pressures of the Vietnam War and Jude's face become bloodied and beaten. It's a scene that brought tears to my eyes and streaming down my cheeks. Thinking about it brings these tears back, but makes my urge to see the film again even stronger.The cameos should also be mentioned, as they are particularly lovely. Bono is hilarious as the drugged out, 'inspirational' Dr. Robert, but it's Eddie Izzard who steals the show. His Mr. Kite is hilarious, surreal and utterly brilliant and through him, Taymor creates a scene that will take you on an acid trip harder than anything Hunter S. Thompson experienced. Another bizarre cameo was that of Salma Hayek who had me lost for at least five minutes. I thought I was stereotyping every Latino woman into the same category of appearance, because I was sure it was Salma Hayek but was confident that she wouldn't take such a random and tiny part in the film. Of course this is when I remembered that Hayek was directed to her Oscar-nominated role in Frida by Julie Taymor and she must have asked to be in the film. Later I learned this to be true.Of course even though the cameos are so exceptional, the main performances highlight the wonder of the film. Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess have perfect chemistry and their acting abilities are just as profound as their lyrical beauty. In fact everyone who plays a musical part really amazes me by their singing talents. Surprisingly, it's Joe Anderson who steals the show in this one. He is charismatic, gorgeous and brilliantly hilarious throughout the first half of the film and then we see the entire affect that the madness of war plays on the mind simply through his painful eyes in the second half. Since the second I first saw the trailer, I thought this was going to be the greatest experience of my life. Slowly I realized that nothing could possibly live up the expectations I had created for this epic cinematic journey. Well, I was proved wrong as Taymor easily met my expectations and more than exceeded them. This was a journey unlike any other, and created a cathartic experience far too brilliant for words. Just impeccable in every way.",8,0,2,8 January 2008
I Am Legend," Smith is brilliant.
","I'll start by saying that Will Smith delivers a superb performance. He completely carries this film on his shoulders, and I don't think that anyone could have succeeded like he did. A phenomenal work from him. The film does drag a lot, for me, in the first couple of acts but it really could have only been done that way. I adored the complete lack of a score and felt it added to the ambiance, making the audience feel like they were also the last person on Earth. Some of the contrivances really irked me (like the girl showing up right before he died....after not hearing his radio message for three years and finally coming just as he lost all hope) but they were pretty easy to look past. Just like everyone complains about, I wasn't a fan of the monsters. The idea of using CGI instead of makeup effects really disappointed me. And I wasn't a big fan of the ending. The martyr thing always pulls on my heart, so I was fine with that, but the whole 'super-duper happy commune' thing felt really contrived. Oh, and I couldn't watch Sam's last scene.",8,1,3,20 January 2008
Gran Torino," The best performance of Eastwood's career.
","I've never been a fan of Clint Eastwood, as a writer or director. In fact I've hated almost every single film he's directed or starred in. When I first saw the trailer for Gran Torino, I couldn't stop laughing. I thought it looked absolutely ridiculous and full to the brim with clichés and stupidity. So all things were pointing to this being one of my least favorite films of the year. Much to my surprise, it turned out to be quite the opposite. Gran Torino is one of the best films of the year, Eastwood's best directorial work since Mystic River and it contains the greatest performance of his career.That's not to say it's without flaws, of course. As a whole, the film is very clichéd (the angry old man mentors the naive, fatherless boy, the angry old war veteran is haunted by his past, etc.) but that's easy to look past because it's not a film about the story; not really. It's about this character and his transition throughout. Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a bitter, angry old man. He spends his days drinking beer on his porch with his dog, admiring his beautiful lawn and the 1972 Gran Torino he has sitting in his garage. When he's not on his porch, he's growling to himself, talking to his dog about his disgust for the Koreans who have moved into his neighborhood. Walt is a traditional man, and it's easy to see why things in his life make him hate his family (his grandchildren where football jerseys and shirts revealing their bellies to his wife's funeral, for instance) and isolate himself to his home.His disgust for the world is put to the test when a group of Hmong gangbangers attack the young boy who lives next door to him, and Walt steps in with a rifle when they cross over onto his lawn. He saves the young boy, Thao (Bee Vang) and as a result the Hmongs in the neighborhood start to worship Walt and consider him a savior to the people living there. At first Walt turns away their love and admiration, but slowly they beat it into him to the point where he accepts their gifts and starts to associate with his neighbors. They bring down the wall of anger that Walt has built up around him over the years, and when they start to move into his life he realizes that he has more in common with these people he detested than he does with his own family. He finds a common understanding with the Hmong family next door, and accepts Thao's request to help him with chores around the house. What results from this is your typical story of an old man mentoring the young, fatherless boy, but Eastwood has a way of making it all feel fresh. Nick Schenk's screenplay definitely helps in making it feel more original than one would expect. To my knowledge there has never been a scene in a story like this where the old man takes the young boy to his barber to show him how to talk like a man, by insulting everyone your friends and doing nothing but complaining about how much life breaks your balls. Something I didn't expect from this film was just how intentionally hilarious it was. The scenes with the barber (the always under-appreciated John Carroll Lynch) are some of the funniest stuff of the year.Walt invests himself into the Hmongs life and when the gangbangers come back and start harassing Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her), he feels a responsibility to step in and protect them. Walt wants to do something meaningful at the end of his life, something to repay for the sins he committed in the war and defend the few people who he feels are good in this world. It's all a little typical, but as I said earlier, Gran Torino isn't really about the story. It's a character study of a haunted old man who opens his door and finds that the people he despised are actually more akin to himself than his own family, and the fact that he'll do anything to protect the people he's come to care for throughout the film. Clint Eastwood directs this all with that old Hollywood feel he's been pouring into his films this decade which makes it feel very cinematic, which is a good thing in the context of the film.The real shining aspect of this film, however, is his performance which is astonishing. He imbues Kowalski with an air of Dirty Harry and it works so well for the character, because this all feels like it could be the final installment of the Dirty Harry franchise and it would be the best film in that solid series. Eastwood doesn't hold anything back, slurring off every racist remark in the book within the first half hour and making it all feel so believable. And despite all of the racism and bitter resentment for everything in the world, Kowalski remains an insanely likable character (the fact that I found a lot to relate to in him definitely helps, but it mostly comes entirely from Eastwood's brilliant portrayal). I enjoyed watching him for every second he was on screen and as his heart warmed to the Hmongs (without ever getting sentimental or anything close), so did mine. The Hmong actors all give pretty terrible performances (especially Her), but it's easy to look past that when the film is anchored by such a tremendous lead. On the surface, Gran Torino seems like something typical and potentially ridiculous. But don't let that deceive you. This is a subtle, powerful film with an ending as devastating as it is moving.",8,2,5,14 January 2009
Moulin Rouge!," Dazzling.
","I think that dazzling would be the best word to describe this film. Everything about it is just visually pleasing from the set designs to the beautiful costumes. The idea of adding unique flare to classic songs (i.e. 'Heroes') really made me adore all of the musical numbers. For the most part, the charisma and eccentric nature of the film was hilarious and a joy to watch. However there were certain points, mostly in the first half, that were a little bit too out there for me to enjoy and ended up distracting me from the film as a whole. A lot of the film was really cheeky and sometimes that worked, but sometimes it turned me off. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman both give absolutely phenomenal performances (the best I've seen from both of them), doing an outstanding job of combining emotional range with drama, musical talent and very charismatic charm. I loved watching them throughout. The story has been done many times before, but it felt really fresh for some reason, maybe that had to do with the overwhelming charisma. I can't get over how fun it was to watch McGregor. Overall, I liked it a lot more than I thought I would and it's certainly one of the best of 2001.",9,5,8,8 January 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Lifeless.
","Hated it. A lot. From the trailer it looked like Button was going to be an epic, self-indulgent way too overly sensationalized mess of a film. Now I don't go into a film expecting anything good or bad, so don't think that I went into it determined to hate it. And even if I had, it wouldn't be for those reasons. Although there are a few moments of the film that fit that description (the Mr. Gateau story, for example), most of the film was more low-key. However what the film did turn out to be was unbearably dull. There was no emotion, no intrigue, no life. It's a shame that a story which is fascinating on paper could turn into a picture that is so absolutely lifeless. The performances, the characters themselves, the direction, the screenplay. All of it contributed to a completely comatose picture. The visuals weren't even impressive. Sure they weren't bad, but they sure as hell weren't anything above average. And thus Button is just another highly-praised film that's making a dent in the awards season that I simply don't understand the praise for, at all. Three hours of my life I wish I could get back.",1,31,63,30 December 2008
Donnie Brasco," A very unique story with two brilliant performances.
","Very entertaining with some of the finest performances of the 90s. Johnny Depp and Al Pacino are such a dangerously grand combination and they are both so dynamic throughout. They both completely amazed me, notably Depp who I didn't expect such a strong, emotional performance from. He usually goes for charisma in his work, which I love, but he really displayed such emotional strength in this. The story itself is phenomenal. The most brutally honest portrayal of the life of a gangster ever created. I definitely wasn't expecting a scene like Johnny Depp cutting a guy's foot off more realistically and years before Saw become such a crave for it's brutality. Anne Heche was also surprisingly great in the best 'semi-abandoned wife of an undercover cop who is trying to care for her kids while desperately missing her husband' role that appears in every film dealing with an undercover cop. She brought real authenticity and sympathy to the role, which I've never seen before.I also thought that the film took a very interesting look into what happens when an undercover becomes too attached to one of the men he's trying to commit. The best scene of the film comes when Joe is in the garage talking to his wife and he is painfully describing that he can't reveal himself as a rat because if he does Lefty, who he has come to love as a father figure, will die for it. He's stuck in such a bind because if he doesn't reveal himself, and stays undercover, he will drive his family away until he loses them. But, if he reveals himself, he is putting the gun in Lefty's mouth and pulling the trigger. It's one of the best acted scenes I've ever witnessed, and Depp makes his emotional pain so palpable in the best acted scene of his career. I really loved this film.",8,1,1,8 January 2008
Casualties of War," Very intense.
","A very powerful story of a unique bravery in the time of war. Usually we see the generic sentimental tales of a group of men banding together, becoming brothers and struggling to make it through a brutal war together. This is a much darker story of a moralistic man doing whatever it takes, no matter what the dangerous cost, in order to give four horrible men the proper punishment. De Palma does a very good job of showing the true side of war, where men go mad, without having to show us the descent of insanity when the men return home. We see the true horror and disgusting nature of soldiers at war, and 'brotherly comradery' shown in films like Saving Private Ryan takes a much darker, disgusting turn for the troop in this one. I must say that the ending was a wonderfully symbolic moment that I hadn't expected from such a hard-hitting straight forward drama. We see the inner pain of seeing something so horrible as kidnapping, rape and murder by men who are supposed to be fighting the good fight, taken in the form of a dream. A dream that takes place on a train, just like where the abducted Vietnamese girl was shot down right before Eriksson's eyes. He makes constant eye contact with a woman, and gets off the train to speak to her. Played by the same actress who portrayed the rape victim, she lets him know that his nightmare is over now. He brought the criminals to justice, put them in prison, and now he deserves to wake up. He did the right thing and, in a saved form of the victim, he becomes aware that his conscience his clear and he can move on with his life. A beautiful ending to a very gut-wrenching film.The performances from the two leads make and break this feature. Sean Penn is on fire in one of the best works of his career. His portrayal of the supposed courageous hero who turns into the leader of a despicable crime is top-notch. The performance is extremely intense and makes the audience terribly afraid for Eriksson. Michael J. Fox was insanely miscast for this kind of a film. After Back to the Future, it only made sense for him to try and escape the nice-guy routine but the unfortunate part is that's the only kind of character that Fox fits in to. He just...doesn't work here, and that's all there is to it. Another aspect of the film that I wasn't too fond of was it's habit of being a tad overly sentimental at times. There are a few scenes where Fox is delivering a righteous monologue about doing the morally right thing, and Ennio Morricone's score (which is a little too sentimental, as always) is really pouring on the attempt to bring the tears flowing, that the film just becomes far too sappy and overly preachy for me to enjoy it. Fortunately this only happens a couple of times, and the rest of the film more than makes up for it.",8,0,1,8 January 2008
The Piano," A symphony of brilliance.
","Coming across an ocean, Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) sits silently with her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) beside her and a piano accompanying. They are on their way to New Zealand where Ada's new husband (Sam Neill), whom she's never met, is waiting to be with her. Upon arrival, the two instantly dislike the newest member of their family as he drags them up towards their home and leaves the piano on the dreary beach. The next day, Ada gets George Baines (Harvey Keitel) a tribesman who works for her husband, to bring them back down to the beach to the piano. Ada is mute, but finds poetic beauty in the sounds that she produces through her piano and I have to say that I was quite moved with their beauty as well and so was George. Or rather, he was moved by Ada's beauty.So George brings the piano up to his home and keeps it there; he arranges for Ada to give him lessons to play and in turn she can play her piano at his home. Soon she finds out that his reasoning for having her come there is of a much more erotic nature. They come to an agreement that for every visit she makes to 'teach him to play', she will be one step closer to him giving her the piano. But while she visits and plays, he makes requests of her (such as lifting her skirt up or taking off her dress-coat so that he can see her arms). Quite quickly these requests come to her laying down next to him and eventually them laying nude together. Initially she is stubborn and put back by this man, but soon she begins to feel for him. Soon she falls in love with him. In this love comes my favorite aspect of the film. It's not your typical love story between two incredibly attractive people torn apart by their families or some twist of fate and they fight to get back to one another. These are two very flawed individuals who have nothing stopping them from being in love, except for her caution towards feeling so deeply for someone again. But once they finally accept their passion for one another, they have her new husband to deal with.The Piano is a tragic film with scenes of extreme tension and one of the most wrenching moments I've ever had to witness on screen when husband Alisdair discovers their affair and picks up his axe. However it's also a beautiful picture with some of the most gorgeous cinematography I've ever seen and a score that sweeps me away. Two shots in particular had me stunned; one focused solely on the piano in it's crate sitting on the beach as the waves crash on the sand behind it, and another where Flora runs over a series of hills to deliver a message to Alisdair. As I said before, the love story in it is certainly unique and thus it's one of my favorites ever depicted on screen. In order for it to work, the performances had to be flawless and they most certainly are. Holly Hunter is painfully moving without saying a word, Sam Neill is flawed and naive throughout the entire picture until the final act where he is absolutely terrifying and Harvey Keitel makes the audience feel as Ada does; at first he is strange and despicable but we realize that under this creepy exterior is a gentle lover and Keitel perfectly embodies both aspects of this. My only complaint with the film is in the young Anna Paquin, who won an Oscar for this role. I personally found her to not only be unbearably annoying, but her scenes near the end felt so forced and ridiculous it almost came to the point of hilarity. If it wasn't for the incredible performances surrounding her and the power of the story, I believe I would have ended up laughing. However when there is such strength and flawlessness encompassing everything, one little thing isn't going to ruin the experience. An absolutely incredible film with such a beautiful ending.",10,0,3,18 April 2008
Black Snake Moan," Ricci is on fire.
","Entertaining with great performance from Ricci. I've rarely seen such a courageous performance, and if you add that to the remarkable range she has throughout it's one of the better performances of the year. Also, when the hell did she got so hot and skinny? Jesus Christ. Justin Timberlake was also surprisingly good, displaying some strong acting skills. It's a shame that him and Ricci had absolutely no chemistry. I also loved the blues music scattered throughout. It really gave the film a great ambiance and put the viewer in the mindset of the characters. The main flaw of the film for me was the fact that I didn't care about any of the characters at all. It was also incredibly unrealistic how the minister was perfectly fine with a girl being chained up in Laz's house and that the boy didn't tell anyone, amongst other unrealisms. I really liked it though, a lot more than I thought.",6,2,6,8 January 2008
Big Fish," Burton crafts another masterpiece.
","An utterly fantastic journey from start to finish. Every second of it brings a complete smile to my face. There is a quote from the film that is something like 'Sometimes things can be so strange, yet seem so familiar.' That directly applies to this entire film. It is filled with events that are so strange and magically bizarre, but everything feels so close to home. It was just two hours of what I felt was the best day of my entire life. Of course, coming from Tim Burton, the visuals and cinematography are absolutely breathtaking. All of the surreal happenings are just breathtakingly beautiful. The set designs are possibly the best I've ever seen. The performances are all phenomenal, as expected from such a superb cast. Helena Bonham Carter is absolutely exceptional, and Albert Finney makes me feel some of the most strong sympathy I've ever felt. Billy Crudup does the same. Alison Lohman is just gorgeous. Her beauty radiates across the screen and makes it very easy to believe why Edward Bloom would fall so madly in love with her. Ewan is as charismatic as ever, creating one of the most likable characters I've ever seen. It's a fascinating film full of greatness from a standard suburbia to a Utopian commune to a roaring circus and all the way across seas to the war.",10,3,4,8 January 2008
The Insider," Ordinary people under extraordinary pressure.
","Sitting in a lush New York restaurant, Liane Wigand (Diane Venora) gets up and leaves the table in a reserved fit of anger after learning that her husband, Jeffrey (Russell Crowe) is going to record a taping the next day for 60 Minutes where he plans to expose the tobacco industry and their web of lies the next day. After she storms off, Jeffrey whom admittedly has a bit of a drinking problem, quietly stands up and marches over to the bar. Remaining at the table, the show's host Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) gleefully stares across at his producer, Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) and asks with a grin on his face 'Who are these people?' Lowell's answer perfectly describes what Michael Mann's visceral, subtle thriller is all about. In one sentence, he summarizes the entire plot and in that shows the genius of how Michael Mann could take something so minimal and make it so extraordinary. Lowell quickly answers 'Ordinary people under extraordinary pressure, Mike.' The Insider focuses primarily on Jeffrey and Lowell, two characters who start in very different places and collide to eventually make drastic changes in each other's lives and the fate of our nation as a whole and it's stand on the tobacco industry. The film opens with Lowell in Israel, blindfolded being taken to a meeting with a reported terrorist whom he convinces to conduct an interview with Mike Wallace for the show. Across the globe in Louisville, Kentucky we are introduced to Jeffrey Wigand as he's walking away from his office for the last time after being fired for what his employer called 'communication problems' but he knows that it was because he was no longer comfortable with what they were doing; lying to the public in order to get them to continue to buy their products while being completely unaware of the consequences. He watched the Seven Dwarfs (the seven CEOs of Big Tobacco) lie under oath, saying that nicotine wasn't addictive, and he was no longer comfortable with it so they let him go and made him sign a confidentiality agreement not to disclose any knowledge he gained while working for Brown & Williamson. Jeffrey had every intention to go home, find a new job and honor this agreement with no exception.As is generally the case with Mann, he quickly (but thoroughly) introduces us to the main characters without wasting half of the running time just to give us the basic background of the characters like the majority of films inevitably do. Mann has a gift for showing us one scene for each main character (in this case, the two leading men) that allows us to understand their entire personality and leaves the vast majority of screen time for the actual story to present itself instead of spending so much time on introducing the characters that the story is left to be bunched together in a flimsy package in the last half hour. After the strong introductions to the characters, we see a typical morning for Lowell Bergman. On the phone every second with his wife answering the other calls, he barely says goodbye to his two children as the eldest informs him that there's a package on the porch for him. When he finally gets around to opening this anonymous delivery and realizes that he's going to need a consultant in order to translate the documents into words he can understand. Through a network of communications, he's connected with Jeffrey Wigand who agrees to help him but refuses to do anything that would breach his confidentiality agreement.That is, until Brown & Williamson make a grave mistake. After hearing that Jeffrey has spoken with Lowell, they bring him back in and ask him to sign another agreement that 'more thoroughly defines what confidential is'. After some poorly chosen words by the company's CEO Thomas Sandefur (Michael Gambon), Wigand becomes infuriated and gets the impression that the company is threatening not only his life but also the life of his family. He doesn't sign the paper, storms out of the office and immediately calls Lowell, thus embarking them on the journey that will vastly change both of their lives. Wigand goes through an emotional roller-coaster in order to do what he knows is the right thing by exposing Big Tobacco for the frauds that they are. His family is threatened and eventually leaves him, his paranoia reaches several breaking points and his life is ultimately destroyed by his decision to come forward; through all of this, he still firmly believes that it's worth it. He becomes a martyr in order to expose the lies of Big Tobacco, and Lowell guides him through this crusade. Through Lowell we are given an inside look into the new industry and we see very raised emotions that explode, Network-esquire, including one particularly stunning scene where Mike Wallace scolds 'corporate lackey' Helen Caperelli (Gina Gershon) for cutting the guts out of a controversial statement he made.Just like Network, The Insider's sensational story of corruption and the web of the media is hinged on numerous brilliant performances. Russell Crowe gives possibly the finest performance of the entire decade. His subtle portrayal of Wigand's paranoia and indecisiveness is stunning, but what's even more brilliant is the actor's ability to display all of the bottled up rage and fear that Wigand had bound up inside of him. The few scenes where these emotions explode are some of the most emotionally draining experiences I've ever witnessed on film. Though Crowe is definitely the shining point of the acting ensemble, the rest of the cast also excels (primarily Al Pacino, Christopher Plummer and Diane Venora). Mann's direction is truly ingenious, as it always is. His style is beautifully unique and smooth and he manages to create a visceral, highly engaging film unlike any I've ever seen. In the end, The Insider is an impeccable character study of 'ordinary people under extraordinary pressure'.",10,0,1,4 December 2007
The Dark Knight," More than just a superhero film.
","Gotham is in turmoil. In Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne created Batman as a symbol for justice and to put fear into the hearts of criminals. By the end of the film he had succeeded, but in The Dark Knight we see that his vision has turned Gotham into an even more chaotic world filled with more crime than ever and littered with pseudo-vigilantes dressing up as Batman and unsuccessfully attempting to fight crime. The story begins briefly after its predecessor ended, opening with a bank robbery constructed by the Joker and his thugs. We are immediately introduced to how this madman works, killing off his thugs as the robbery gets closer to completion. But he's not robbing the back for the money; he's sending a message to the mob that he can take as much as their money as he wants and they can't do anything to stop him. At first Batman tries to ignore the Joker and continue his attack on the mob, but he'll soon realize that nothing is more terrifying than this completely unhinged maniac, motivated only by the desire to spread destruction.The key theme running throughout The Dark Knight is the idea of justice in a corrupt society. Wayne (Christian Bale) created Batman as a symbol of that justice, but he didn't plan on being Batman forever and he's looking for someone to replace his position as this symbol. Enter Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), the new District Attorney and Gotham's White Knight. The city sees him as a beacon of hope, and unlike Batman, this symbol is an elected official with a face everyone can look up to. He doesn't use theatrics to put fear into criminals, but he demonstrates that not everyone is corrupt and he's going to do whatever it takes to bring down those who are. Bruce sees him as the right man to bring decency to Gotham and allow him to quit being Batman and be with Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), his love who is currently dating Dent. So Batman and Dent team up, along with the morally upright Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) to put an end to corruption in Gotham and for a while it looks like they're going to succeed.The Joker (Heath Ledger), however, refuses to let decency win out. He stands as an agent of absolute chaos and he wants to show the world that deep down, when you strip away all hope for justice, everyone is capable of destruction. To prove his point he spends the film testing these three men who show that they aren't going to back down easily. And so the battle for Gotham's should begins. The Joker constantly throws pain and aggression into the faces of this city and forces everyone to show that they are capable of unimaginable cruelty, just like he is. Batman and Gordon stand strong against this menacing psychopath no matter what the Joker throws at them, but he eventually finds the trigger in Harvey Dent that brings him down from his status as the White Knight into a frightening but incredibly sympathetic monster.In creating Two-Face, Christopher Nolan does what I think is one of the smartest moves in the history of this genre. He doesn't just throw a villain at us and expect us to be afraid of them or to sympathize with them and he doesn't have fifteen minutes introducing the character and then show us a freak accident that turns them into the villain for the rest of the film. We meet this character as Harvey Dent, a symbol for decency and get invested in him as such. I personally almost forgot what his horrible fate was destined to be throughout a large portion of the film, through the shear fact that he was displayed as such a large icon for morality. Seeing him as this makes his complete decay into madness even more devastating to the point where it brought me to tears. Aaron Eckhart's performance is absolutely phenomenal. Yes, all of the talk is about Heath Ledger, yes he was a force to be reckoned with, and yes he gave easily the best performance in the film to say the least. But Eckhart is almost as magnificent. He is terrifying after his transformation into Two-Face, but we can still see the man we came to know him as throughout the film. There is one scene in particular, before he becomes Two-Face, where we can start to see the primal aggression that is going to take control of him boiling up inside and it terrified me and broke my heart all at once.Of course with any talk about The Dark Knight, there must be a detailed discussion about Heath Ledger's performance. To say that he immersed himself into the role would be an insult to the genius that is portrayed here. His unfortunate passing isn't even a factor when saying that this performance is so far beyond flawless that it almost surpasses any expectation I could have had. His work in the interrogation scene is so real and terrifying that it would have been impossible to watch if he didn't suck the viewer in so perfectly. I mean, the Joker is nothing but pure chaos and Ledger flawlessly creates that. This masochistic, destructive force goes from being charismatically hilarious one second to immensely terrifying the next. It gets to the point where you have no idea what he's going to do next, but you know that it's going to be brilliant. That interrogation scene alone is enough to convince me that it's one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. Words can't even come close to doing justice to this man's genius.",8,6,13,19 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Absolutely glorious.
","As a story, Order of the Phoenix is easily my second favorite of the series (behind Deathly Hallows). In the first four films we never really experience the true girth of the story at hand. It's all about the children developing into mature young adults who fully comprehend the wizarding battle and, more importantly, the danger of Lord Voldemort so that by the time we get to the last three stories they are prepared for battle against him and we can fully focus on the war at hand. There's always a great story/mystery with the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and how they always end up being the complete opposite of what they appear to be, and of course the genius of Sirius Black's introduction in Prisoner of Azkaban always amazes me but the story always centers around the children and their growth.Order brings the series up to the dark, epic scale that makes Harry Potter's overall journey so phenomenal. It let's the audience know that there is a war coming. Each team is gathering their forces (the Order is rejoining and finding new members, especially in the form of Dumbledore's Army created by Hogwarts students who know there is a war coming and prepare to fight when it does and Voldemort gathering his Death Eaters and attempting to find the prophecy that he didn't have the first time) and the connection between Harry and Voldemort that was subtly mentioned in the first four films really takes center stage in this one. The final thirty minutes kept me glued to my seat with the sensational battle that is only a precursor for the epic war that's going to take place in the final two films, and then the epic duel between Dumbledore and Lord Voldemort that was beefed up from the novel and ended up being one of the most astonishing experiences I've ever had watching a film.I really can't say enough about how brilliant the overall story of the series is, and Order of the Phoenix brings the idea of war right on the surface preparing everyone (the characters and the audience) for the epic scale that's going to take place in Half-Blood Prince. As always the visuals, cinematography and art direction are some of the best I've ever seen and possibly the best of the year. Overall, the performances are fantastic. The regular children are getting better and better as time goes on (Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were magnificent in this one) aside from Daniel Radcliffe who is just keeping a steady pace of horrific acting; his scenes of anger and frustration ended up being absolutely laughable.The supporting cast is flawless as always. I wish they hadn't cut so much out of the occlumency sessions but they still presented what was integral to the story and added a lot of depth to Snape. Gary Oldman's return was also very well-done and he once again proved that he's one of the finest actors in the series. As always, everyone is underused (particularly David Thewlis who is one of the best actors alive, delivered one of the series' best performances in Prisoner of Azkaban and was insulted with not a single word of dialogue in this film) but that's to be expected. However the film does introduce quite possibly the two greatest performances of the entire series. Feeling as if they were ripped from the pages of the book and put onto the screen, Helena Bonham Carter (as the sadistic, maniac Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange) and Evanna Lynch (in her film debut as the whimsical Luna Lovegood) perfectly capture their characters like I could never have imagined.As always there were some exclusions from the book that upset me greatly; the final conversation between Dumbledore was over ten pages in the book and left me in tears (a conversation which also explains why Harry has to go back to the Dursleys every summer instead of removing him from that terrible place) while in the film it was a barely-memorable minute chat and they cut so much out of the ending (Harry's conversation with Luna about the fate of the dead and Moody's threat to the Dursleys, in particular). But exclusions are to be expected and they weren't nearly as horrific as they were in Goblet of Fire, so it's easy to forgive. Order of the Phoenix is by far the second best film in the series, behind Azkaban, one of the most entertaining films of the year and a perfect epic journey from start to finish. The best apart about it all is that it's just a precursor for the epic scale and sensational wizarding war that will take place in the next two films. I can't wait.",9,0,1,12 December 2007
Into the Wild," Jaw-dropping.
",Immensely inspiring. It's a beautiful film filled with lush cinematography and superb performances. The driving force has got to be in the story. Christopher McCandless' theory of life is one that I couldn't relate to more and seeing how his life played out was extremely compelling. Emile Hirsch was...sensational. A performance that held so many emotions on it's shoulders and combined them flawlessly. In one brief smile I felt all the happiness that he gathered from the wild in my heart. This sheer joy and inspiration was contrasted painfully with the heartache of his final days on Earth which Hirsch again captured expertly in nothing more than his eyes. The shot near the beginning of his eyes tearing up as he sees the beauty of a herd of animals roaming in the snow is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. I can't describe how much I loved Hirsch in this. It's a poetic and wonderfully uplifting tale that had me in awe the entire duration. I should also mention that Eddie Vedder's songs were breathtaking.,10,1,4,4 March 2008
Annie Hall," A witty, unique masterpiece.
","One of the most original films I've ever seen. Woody Allen uses a bounty of different techniques in the film to the point where it almost feels experimental, but he doesn't base the film around these techniques. He breaks the fourth dimension (in a very High Fidelity fashion), has the characters walking around in their own flashbacks, has subtitles detailing the characters' thoughts and fragments the story but he never overdoes any of the techniques. He makes them all feel natural and doesn't use anything for the entire film. In doing this it all feels very fresh and vibrant and moves at a quick pace. It's ninety minute running time was also quite nice with so many films running well over two hours these days. Allen integrates these techniques into a very relatable story of the relationship between the neurotic, self-destructive Alvy Singer (Allen) and the beautiful, intelligent aspiring singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). I found Alvy's nervousness and cynicism to be very relatable to my own personality and that really helped me to connect with this character and feel his emotions as the film progressed. Of course the fact that it was absolutely witty and hilarious really helped my love for it.",10,0,0,25 January 2008
"Girl, Interrupted"," Ryder shines.
","An outrageously flawless performance from the lovely Winona Ryder highlights this interesting, though sometimes tedious film. Some if it felt really out of place but for the most part it was a compelling story. Not entirely unique and with a load of cliché characters and scenes, it still found ways to keep drawing me in and focusing on the plot. As I said before, Ryder is phenomenal in one of my favorite female performances of the decade and is surely my win for the year. Her range and emotional intensity is flawless. I found that her character was extremely easy for me to relate to and that made her performance that much more emotional for me. Jolie was also great and deserved her win, though I give it to Bonham Carter.",9,1,1,4 February 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Breathtaking.
","The word 'masterpiece' doesn't even begin to describe the stunning brilliance of this film. It is more deep, profound and complex than any other work I've ever seen. I am still completely baffled by elements of it. I have my own interpretations, as everyone does, and I can see the connections between everything but I'm sure it is far more complex than my rather simplistic interpretation. Just everything about it (the 'Dawn of Man', HAL, beyond the infinite, the monolith, the Star Child) is absolutely mind blowing. I still can't seem to grasp my head around the perfection that I just experienced. Technically speaking, it's a marvel. The cinematography and visual effects are sensational, and it is rare to find ones superior. I wasn't bored for a second. There are a few instances where the story seems to drag a little bit, but it's necessary to further the story and explain everything that is occurring. Without these little drags, the story would be just full of holes and situations that are left unexplained. However, Kubrick recognizes this slight dullness and uses remarkable visuals, cinematography and a booming score to keep the viewer thoroughly engaged no matter what the situation. It's been over an hour and a half since I finished the film and I am still stunned, basking in it's supreme magnificence. Certainly one of the finest achievements of all time, and easily the best Kubrick I've seen so far. Exceeded any expectation I had.",10,5,12,8 January 2008
Blood Diamond," One of the best of 2006.
","A completely exhilarating experience. It's a wild ride in a foreign land that grabs you in it's opening sequence and never let's go. The story is simple. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a man living in 1999 war-torn Sierra Leone trying to make an honest living and raise his son to be a doctor when rebels invade his village and force him to work in the mines trying to discover diamonds for the illegal diamond trade with companies across the globe. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a smuggler who has lived his entire life in Africa and makes his living by taking the diamonds out of Sierra Leone and bringing them to the people that can get them out for retail sale. Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is an American journalist doing a story about Leone and its civil war over the blood diamonds.Through a series of events, coincidence and propositions Solomon finds a large diamond, hides it and agrees to show Danny where it is with the promise of being reunited with his family. In order to get to his family, Danny needs to provide Maddy with information regarding the conflict diamonds and who is involved in trading them. So all three of them embark on the same journey with very different motivations. Solomon wants nothing more than to be reunited with his family. Danny wants to get the diamond so that he can make enough money to finally get out of Africa. And Maddy wants her story and to do whatever she can to help the innocent people of this war-torn country. What follows is an extraordinary adventure that contains a beautiful exploration of African culture, an in-depth study of the lives of those affected by conflict diamonds and some of the most exciting action sequences of all time.Though the film may appear to be too preachy at times, I think it avoided the more-traveled route of chastising America for two hours and instead presented the real situation of what happened (and is still happening) in areas of the world at war over conflict diamonds while providing a high level of quality entertainment. It never rants about America's misdeeds but presents the well-known fact that if people weren't buying these diamonds, there wouldn't be any war over them. It never slaps American wrists but it constantly flows with a purposeful cause and a riveting story. DiCaprio and Hounsou give two of the most impressive performances of the year (particularly the former) and switch seamlessly from wildly intense rage to biting cynicism to heartfelt sincerity. DiCaprio really manages to shine however with even more contrast displayed in his roller coaster quick romance with Jennifer Connelly's Bowen, a seductive and highly intelligent product of a journalist's background. There is also a subplot involving child soldiers that is just as informative as it is haunting and terribly unnerving.",9,0,0,8 January 2008
Pride & Prejudice," Easily one of my all time favorites.
","Unarguably the finest love story of all time. The themes and characters in the film are all beautiful and timeless. Joe Wright manages to capture every flawless element of the novel, while making it massively entertaining and creating the best cinematography I've seen in a long while. The gorgeous landscapes mixed with the pouring rain and the entrancing score create an utterly joyous experience throughout. A seamless blend of side-splitting humor, gut-wrenching drama and the most passionate and beautiful romance ever brought to screen. Performance wise the film is just as flawless as the storytelling. Knightley more than deserved her Oscar-nomination, and a win in my books, but the phenomenal work in the acting field doesn't stop there. Everyone from Rosamund Pike to Donald Sutherland and back to Matthew Macfadyen deliver nothing but praise-worthy brilliance. The finale is one of the most joyous, wonderful and simply pleasing experiences of my lifetime. An utter joy to watch, and very high among the best of the decade so far. The best of it's year, undoubtedly.",10,2,6,8 January 2008
The Hurricane," Denzel is a powerhouse.
","A film that pleasantly surprised me. I really just thought it was going to be the same old mundane biopic with a good performance on top like they always are but it drew real emotion out of me and felt very inspiring. What happened to Carter is absolutely tragic and just...despicable, but seeing the affect that one person can have on another human being and how drastically it can change that person's life is immensely moving. It's nothing unique but it's definitely among the best biopics I've seen, and it's a story that needed to be told. Denzel Washington is just sensational. One of the best performances of the decade, and probably the best of his career in my eyes.",8,0,3,9 January 2008
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," A remarkable study on what divides a nation and a family.
","This film is really split into two separate films. One is a grand story of war; how one can easily get swept up into it and can never escape, how it can change drastically people and how it can tear the closest relationships apart. The other is a hard-hitting political drama, filled with intense courtroom arguments and even more engaging debates among the community (in this case, among the leaders of the IRA). The story of war is utterly heartbreaking. We see Damien become quickly engaged as a leader of a war that he never wanted to be involved in, and the toll this war takes on him throughout his life.We slowly realize that the war will never end; there will just be more and more killings, and those who are involved can never escape it. Even after the IRA receives everything they have asked for, after many debates of whether to compromise or not, some members are still unsatisfied and paranoid and they revolt setting off another war between fellow Irishmen. This is where we see the tearing of one of the strongest relationships known to man. Two loving brothers, who meant the world to each other at the beginning, are ripped apart onto opposite sides of this civil war. The parallel between Damien and Teddy's relationship from the beginning of the film to the end of the film is utterly fascinating. At the beginning we see them in a prison together, ready to be executed by each other's side. Damien says that his name is Teddy's so that they will torture him instead of Teddy, though the farce doesn't work.At the end, we see Damien sitting in the same prison cell. The amazement of this is that Teddy is the one running the prison this time around, and it's Damien who is to be executed. The finale is one of the most gutwrenching and utterly heartbreaking scenes of cinematic history for me. I could barely stand to watch, and tears quickly rose to my eyes. Overall this is a phenomenal film, and easily one of the best of 2006. Cillian Murphy delivers a phenomenal performance that ranks among the best of the year. Padraic Delaney and Liam Cunningham also give quite the exceptional work. I should also mention the gorgeous cinematography which does a phenomenal job of setting the scene for this heartbreaking and vastly engaging political war drama.",9,1,6,9 January 2008
The Descent," One of the best horror films in decades.
","Sticks to the basic formula of modern horror films (an hour of character development, a thirty minute rush with the baddies) but completely excels in every element of it. It doesn't transcend the genre, but instead it perfects it. It builds strong characters and goes in depth with the majority of them so that we become familiar with who these characters are and we become worried, knowing that their lives will soon be in grave danger. The first half delves into the mystery and fear of simply being in the cave. They are lost in an unknown territory with no help possible from the outside world. Marshall does a great job of developing a strong sense of claustrophobia and paranoia and a desperate need to escape from the hellish cave that these ladies have become lost in.Then the second half steps it up enormously, creating one of the most frightening experiences of my life. The creatures are absolutely terrifying and put the viewer in a constant state of fear and even further paranoia. We forget about the need to escape the cave, though it is still a strong desperation, and we focus on the more pressing need to escape the creatures. The title certainly presents numerous meanings. There is the obvious descent further and further into the depths of the cave. Then there is the obvious descent into a metaphoric hell as they go darker and darker and finally the creatures appear. Yet even more internally, there is the characters descent into complete madness. The paranoia and insanity of it all is mostly apparent through Juno, who after accidentally stabbing Beth turns into a killing machine, and Sarah who, after actually killing Beth, becomes even more of a hollowed shell, absolutely annihilating everything in her way. This includes handicapping her only living friend, whom she just found out had an affair with her husband and that's why her husband and daughter died, which I hated at first but have just grown to love more and more. Her 'badassness' was just overwhelming and completely awesome.The ending is one of the greatest of recent years (I saw the original UK ending where Sarah doesn't actually escape, by the way). It transcends the Hollywood trend of the one hot girl that we see from beginning to end surviving all of the impossible to survive odds and getting away from the horror, in the most unrealistic fashion. But in this ending, we see the realistic fact that no one has a chance of surviving those odds and a great revelation of complete mental breakdown to the horrors of the descent. This film also has the privilege of being the only film that I've screamed like a black person during, which happened when the creature appeared on the video camera. I'm normally a fan of more ambietic, mental horror but this film just had my pulse racing like I was having a heart attack whilst soiling myself. I've rarely had a more frightening, yet extremely entertaining time watching a film. It also has the privilege of making me grimace and mutter 'Fuck.' more than any other picture.",8,2,4,9 January 2008
Three Colors: Blue," Stunning.
","At it's core, Blue is really an uplifting story of a woman who loses her husband and child (something I could never imagine the pain of ) and is slowly able to bring herself back into a working society. It's really stunning the way she gathers herself together at the end, but the final shot shows us that she'll never truly be rid of the pain from that situation. We also see how one person in such a tragic circumstance can affect so many lives and I thought that was really touching. Kieslowski does amazing work with colors here as he uses stark, vibrant reds, greens and blues that completely draw the viewers attention and suck them in. I loved the little scenario with the mice in Julie's apartment and how instinctively she tried to kill them but once she realized it was a family she was unable to do it. I also adored the repetition of her diving into the lush blue swimming pool, as a way of almost freeing herself from all of the stress and pain that's building up inside of her. Of course the first thing she does when she emerges from the water is cry. Overall it's a completely sublime film that I couldn't take my eyes off of. The final shot of Binoche (who gives an amazingly subtle performance) staring directly into the camera with a tear dried on her face and another emerges and runs down is truly heartbreaking. It feels as though she's staring right through us and into our soul.",10,2,3,3 February 2008
The Happening," A huge disappointment.
","As a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan and someone who thought this was going to be his best film by a long shot, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. The concept of an event occurring where people are dying and being evacuated and panicking with no one really knowing what the cause of it is certainly is an interesting one and Night manages to convey that aspect of the film very well. He gives the entire film a very ominous, eerie feel to it that few filmmakers could come close to achieving and I don't think anyone could do as well as he can. The film itself is pretty terrifying for the most part and (not to spoil anything) he somehow conjures up the ability to make the simple image of grass moving a very frightening experience.That being said, the writing is where the film ultimately starts to unravel. The dialogue is some of the most laughable and unnatural stuff I've ever heard in a film. I was shocked to see such a talented filmmaker write so poorly. And with such terrible writing, the actors don't have a whole lot to work with. It seems like they knew the dialogue wasn't real, but still tried to force it out and it all feels really artificial. Even the simple idea of trying to make Mark Wahlberg say big words in an attempt to prove that his character really is a teacher ends up making me laugh. Wahlberg himself is slightly above average and while Zooey Deschanel delivers easily the worst performance of her career (a shame since I love her to death), it's in the supporting roles that the acting truly turns disastrous. As always with Night, he tries to use some sense of humor to ease the tension of the film and it falls completely flat. The humor in most of his films is pretty terrible, but usually there is someone like Joaquin Phoenix or Paul Giamatti there to miraculously pull it off. Wahlberg and Deschanel weren't as lucky and even they couldn't make the jokes feel like anything more than an embarrassment from an incredibly talented filmmaker.A lot of scenes just appear to be jokes out of some sort of parody film...until you realize that Night is actually trying to be serious. An example: a group of five (Wahlberg, Deschanel, a friend's child and two douchebag high schoolers) are knocking on the door to a boarded up house, trying to get inside for some food for the child. After the people inside tell them to leave, the douchebag kids start trying to break the door and windows open to get in. The barrel of a gun sticks out the window and aims toward one of the kid's heads. And, I kid you not, Wahlberg moves in slow motion, screaming the kid's name, as he takes the bullet in the back of the head. It's ridiculous and a real shame knowing what it could have been.",3,10,21,13 June 2008
The Fountain," An emotional journey.
","Aronofsky perfects his vision with this wondrous, emotionally draining experience. It transcends being a film and completely immerses the audience into it's world and story; drawing them further and further along until the explosive finale. I wasn't too crazy about some of the dialogue, and Cliff Curtis' horrific accent almost made me kill myself but aside from those two minor things, the entire film was mind-blowing. Hugh Jackman's intense, emotional performance was stunning and had me in tears. Rachel Weisz was also quite good, though she suffered from the majority of the dialogue that I didn't like. Aronofsky creates his vision by combining the sensational score and cinematography to drive the viewer along this incredible journey.",8,1,3,13 February 2008
Mystic River," Haunting; the best film of 2003.
","Since Dennis Lehane is my favorite author and I adore all of his stories, it's pretty clear that Mystic River is a film that compels me from start to finish. The story is one of my favorites of all time and is filled with intricately detailed characters full of flaws and backstory. Lehane took care in crafting all of these people so that all of them feel natural and none are completely unlikeable, but none of them come without flaws. He has a talent for making human characters and Mystic River is where this is best on display.The mystery of the film is conveyed perfectly; we are never so focused on figuring out who did it so we can be engaged in the lives of these people, but always in the back of our mind we are trying to unravel the plot. When the answer finally comes, it stuns me. Lehane's Boston roots show again as he immerses us into this city and how everything stems from the King that is Jimmy Markum. This dark, mysterious story is perfectly structured until the wrenching and painfully haunting finale. All three of these characters collide twenty-five years after an event that would destroy anyone's childhood. We see how their lives have built over the years and how each has come to be in this devastating story. Lehane's detail in this is incredible.When looking at the cast you can expect some phenomenal performances, and that's exactly what you get. Sean Penn gives one of the best of the decade in his intense and emotional portrayal of Markum. Tim Robbins also deserved his Oscar win and Kevin Bacon deserved much more critical acclaim for his subtle portrayal as the Detective trying to put all of the pieces together. An incredible, gut wrenching story that sticks with me well after the credits are through. It's Eastwood's best film by a long shot and the best film of 2003.",10,4,7,10 February 2008
A Beautiful Mind," Flawless.
","It's a stunning tale of perseverance and quite possibly the finest character study of all time. The film does a great job of exploring every single aspect of John Nash's mind and when we finally see him for who he truly is, my heart breaks. A heartbreaking film that becomes almost unbearable to watch as Nash combats with his own mind between what he knows is right and what his mind tells him is real. The fact that he had such a beautiful gift for codebreaking but along with it came an unimaginable curse is terrifying. I believe it's impossible to understand what possibly could go through John Nash's head on a daily basis, and the experiences he had to endure throughout his life really are unimaginable but this film does a flawless job of bringing us as close to understanding him as possible. A big help in creating it's brilliance are the phenomenal performances from Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly which are two of the best of their career (probably is the best of Jennifer's), the decade and, I dare-say, of all time. A sensational work.",10,1,4,4 December 2007
The Departed," Phenomenal.
","Even through about ten viewings, The Departed manages to be a highly engaging, suspenseful and thrilling film that's easily one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen. Scorsese creates an entire ensemble of interesting (some more so than others) characters that make every second just as fun and enthralling as the rest. When we switch from Costigan to Sullivan it never loses or gains entertainment value and its steady level is higher than practically any other film around. There's a wonderful mix of humor involved as well, coming primarily from Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin and Jack Nicholson (more in the character's reactions to Nicholson than the man himself). Everyone in the cast is brilliant from DiCaprio and Damon all the way down to Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone (though I've never been too big on Vera Farmiga and thought she was a thousand times better in that year's Running Scared).In my first viewings of The Departed, I knew it was wildly entertaining but I always thought it was a little shallow and the characters lacked depth. But this viewing helped me see that what I originally thought was a thrilling story of undercover deception is really an intricate study of the loneliness and mental breakdown that occurs when you decide to live a lie. As William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) delve further into their life of being an undercover criminal and an undercover cop, respectively, they become so much more lonely and their psyche continually falls apart. While these two character's lives are polar opposites, they are quite similar at their center. They are both morally decent men who live a life of crime for unfortunate reasons; Costigan obviously because he is an undercover cop but Sullivan seems to be a good man at his heart but lives his life of deception out of loyalty to Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) who was always a surrogate father to him after he lost his own. Of course they do have their contrasts which I thought came primarily in their way of making decisions. Costigan is indecisive, paranoid and is never confident in his decisions but Sullivan has snap reflexes and can make an insanely tough decision in a second with no hesitation. But in the end they are more similar than they are different; they even have romantic interest in the same woman. Ultimately it's their loneliness that links these two men; which Scorsese beautifully shows in the shots of Sullivan sitting in his office alone in the dark having to live with the horrific decisions he's made in his life (further proof that he's a morally decent man unlike the purely evil Frank who shoots a woman dead and his only remark is that she fell funny).So while the film is still probably the most entertaining I've ever seen and is stylish, fun and completely enthralling my original belief that it was hollow was quite incorrect. It's a remarkable study of the toll that a life of lies can take on a person and is highlighted by two phenomenal performances that perfectly immerse into these characters. In fact every actor fits perfectly into his character. It never feels like you're watching Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin but you're watching the characters unfold this story. Even in ten viewings it still manages to be completely suspenseful (Damon and DiCaprio sitting silently on the phone with each other, both knowing that the person on the other side is the rat, still had me holding my breath) and wildly entertaining. There's never a dull moment in this magnificent picture that I love more and more every time I see it, and that love was significantly increased in this viewing. I don't think any words can do the story justice, but there is so much depth and intricacy in there that I never saw before. And of course William Monahan does a perfect job of adapting the originally Asian story into the streets and people of Boston. Amazing in every way.",9,2,7,15 December 2007
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," A fun little love story.
","It's pretty typical, but still quite a lot of fun to watch. The scenes just between Nick and Norah are where the film shines the brightest. Cera and Dennings have a great chemistry in both comedic and romantic moments, and they are just a joy to watch all the way through. The film should have just been all about them, but it got bogged down with pretty pointless subplots that got tedious after a while. The entire story with Triss trying to get Nick back was boring and didn't add anything to the film, and while everything with Nick's gay band members was kind of funny it wasn't vital to the story and took screen time away from Nick and Norah which is where it should have been. However there is one subplot that was absolutely hilarious and always made a for a lot of fun and that was Norah's friend Caroline who gets ridiculously wasted at the beginning and spends the entire night lost in the city completely out of her mind. Ari Graynor steals the film away from the two leads in a big way. She dominates every scene with some of the best comedic work of the year. Her scene with Kevin Corrigan (who is dressed as a chef, doesn't say a word and just looks at a sandwich in his lap with a scarily depressed face) is far and away the best scene in the film and probably the funniest of the entire year. It had me dying. Overall, it's a cute little love story about finding your true soul mate in the midst of one chaotic night. A good watch.",7,8,18,4 October 2008
Wedding Crashers," A comic masterpiece from start to finish.
","A pitch-perfect comedy full of laughs and heart from start to finish. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson play off of each other as natural and easily as Abbot and Costello. They really are the perfect comedic duo. Wilson's confidence and heart of gold combined with Vaughn's supremely charismatic hate of the world. All of the performances in the film are golden. Rachel McAdams is so sweet and adorable that you feel like she's the girl next door that you've been in love with your entire life. Christopher Walken is an actor with such warmth and charisma that it's impossible not to love him. The real highlight of the film though is Isla Fisher. She is so natural and convincing in one of the most difficult roles of all time, that is scares the hell out of me. I'm scared to ever meet her because of how convincing she was. Will Ferrell delivered arguably the greatest cameo of all time. Even Bradley Cooper was brilliant as the chauvinistic, over the top jackass who is stealing the adorable, perfect girl. I really love everything about this film. I die in laughter from start to finish every time I see it. It's so quotable as well. My only real complaint is that it's pretty one-dimensional but that can be forgotten with how perfect of a comedy it is. Vince Vaughn is really a comic genius. His style of striking, smooth quick-paced, charismatic cynicism is more brilliant than any comedic style I've ever seen. He really is nothing short of a miracle to comedy.",8,3,4,14 June 2007
There Will Be Blood," A great film.
","There Will Be Blood is a gripping tale of American ambition at the turn of the century and, more importantly, the greed that comes with that ambition succeeding. We are introduced to numerous characters, all of whom say whatever they can in order to gain the most wealth. Every character places their own selfish needs in front of anything else and this compels the story into many dark, unnerving scenes of power and greed.Behind every element of the story is the continuing battle between Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). The core plot is that of Daniel's greed and desire to make enough money that he can escape from everyone else, but Eli constantly shows up to get in his way. He's the kind of annoying ant that you see on the street and immediately want to squash and Plainview embodies that desire. Day-Lewis creates a wince every time Eli appears on screen that feels so much like myself and he finds humor in the young man's absurd preaching and gospel, for he believes that he is a vessel for God. But when Plainview's son H.W. loses his hearing, he finally snaps and bullies Eli into a puddle of oil, shoving it down his throat. This feud continues through decades all the way to the shocking, jaw-dropping final scene. I literally couldn't breathe or move for moments after the final scene...my mind was stunned into a complete catharsis.Charging the entire film is the flawless performance from Daniel Day-Lewis who once again proves why he is the greatest actor of all time. This intense, completely absorbed performance is easily one of the greatest of all time and deserves every award he has received and the Oscar that it's the front-runner for. A haunting portrayal. Most actors would pale in comparison to such a daring portrayal, but Paul Dano rises up to the challenge of having to share the screen with Day-Lewis. He excels, and then some. Dano clearly had no reservations with completely immersing himself into this character. He goes over the top just as Sunday is meant to be and it results in a performance that is one of the best of the decade. Words can't begin to describe the genius behind these two performances.Behind everything in the film is Paul Thomas Anderson who completely sheds the style that he's used in his previous films and creates something unlike anything I've ever seen. He perfectly captures the bleak aspect of the film's setting and the time period, which is the perfect contrast for the painfully unnerving story that he unfolds here. His direction is absolutely top-notch. Jonny Greenwood's score should also be mentioned as it sets the perfect, bone-chilling ambiance that the story should have behind it.",9,4,14,15 January 2008
Man on Fire," Surprisingly phenomenal.
","This is indeed a film that is expertly split into two parts. The first half does a flawless job of developing the relationship between Creasy and Pita and making us feel for these characters. We enjoy watching them interact together, are so excited to see them developing such a strong father/daughter-esquire bond that it completely tears us apart when Pita is taken away. Scott and Denzel do a brilliant job of making us feel Creasy's pain when she gets taken away. It's one of the most emotional scenes of all time, as we see Pita in tears but desperately want her to run before she is taken.This drives the substantial second half, which is a film of emotionless revenge. Creasy's need for vengeance is made completely understandable and we want nothing but for him to succeed in the brutal murders of every person who was involved. It drives some of the best and most stylized action of all time, in a journey that is more than just. We want him to succeed so much it hurts. What I found most interesting about the film was Creasy's transformation from beginning to end. He starts off as a man who doesn't care about anything in the world. He's completely indifferent and doesn't care whether he lives or dies. But it's this little girl who completely brightens up his life and teaches him how to love again, and that's what makes it so arduous for the audience when she is taken away. Pita's kidnapping not only stole her physical body, but it took back Creasy's ability to love. He once again becomes a creature of sheer pain and relentless furiosity in one of the most amazing quests ever put on film.The ending is one of the most bittersweet of all time. On one hand we rejoice in Pita's life and her safe return to her mother. But on the other hand we are in sheer pain as we know what Creasy must do, and that their beautiful reunion will be very short lived. The performances are simply excellent. Denzel is on top form, as always and this is the film that showed me that Dakota Fanning really is a great and underrated actress. Watching her cry is one of the most painful experiences of a film for me.",9,0,3,8 January 2008
The Last King of Scotland," A gripping thriller. McAvoy excels.
","Although it drags at times and some of the scenes are just unintentionally laughable, The Last King of Scotland still manages to be a great blend of the tragedies created by dark political dictator, Idi Amin and the (fictional) adventure story of the young Scottish physician who realizes what's happening and escapes Idi Amin's terror to help bring peace to Uganda. When I first saw the film I put most of my focus onto Forest Whitaker's powerful performance that perfectly combines Amin's intense but horribly childish tantrums with his charismatic charm, but on this re-watch I found myself being more drawn towards James McAvoy's absolutely flawless portrayal of the naive Nicholas Garrigan who slowly realizes that the man he's become attached to is a monster. In my opinion, McAvoy upstages the Oscar-winning Whitaker and gives one of my favorite performances of 2006. The subplot featuring an affair between Garrigan and one of Amin's wives, played by Kerry Washington, felt pretty pointless aside from it being the reason why Amin strings Garrigan up by his skin near the end of the film instead of just shooting him (which is one of the most unnerving, painful to watch scenes I've come to witness). Overall it's a highly engaging story that shows the beauty of a country, the dark underbelly that a dictator can create and the incredible journey that one man takes to bring him down.",8,0,2,9 January 2008
Defiance," Zwick's best film; extraordinary.
","Defiance succeeds where most Holocaust films crash and burn. In most films of this nature, they try to force tragedy down the viewer's throat by depicting everything cinematically so you can say 'Oh, look how well they shot that scene with the the four Nazis raping and killing that girl'. It has a habit of coming off as exploitative to me, instead of just depicting the true events. They put so much effort into showing just how awful everything was, and as a result it feels artificial. I personally don't think a film can ever depict a real life tragedy as despicable as that, and Defiance succeeds because it doesn't try to. Zwick puts the focus onto the characters and their experience, instead of attempting to show the overall brutality of the event. He makes it a character film instead of a Holocaust one.On the surface, this is a relatively simple story of men rising up and protecting people who were in trouble. But at it's heart, there is much more. As I said, it's definitely a character drama and most of the film focuses on the relationships between these people in crisis. Each of the three main brothers (there is a fourth brother who doesn't get much attention) get a significant amount of screen time and their own individual stories of love, tragedy and emotional extremes. Tuvia (Daniel Craig) is the oldest brother and as a result he takes the position as the leader of the group. Craig portrays him wonderfully as a flawed hero, rising to protect so many people but being unable to handle the pressure that comes with it when he's saved them all but now has no idea what to do with them. Zus (Liev Schreiber) is a brute of a man who wants to help these people, but is more focused on getting revenge for the loss of his family. Asael (Jamie Bell) is a boy who develops into a young, experienced man over the course of the film.At it's core, Defiance is a story of three men who rise up out of their tragic circumstances to become something more than just Jews who persevered. They became heroes because they survived while helping others to do the same. But no hero is perfect and that's where the film really drew me in. The drama that was stirred up between these men, whether they were fighting against the Nazis, against the people they saved, or even against each other, absolutely fascinated me. Tuvia has to live with the pressure of trying to provide a decent state of living for all of the people he saved. About halfway through the film, Zus lets his need for violent revenge get in the way of what is truly important and he leaves the woodland society the Bielskis built to go and fight for a group of Russians who are busy killing Nazis. And Asael's transformation is actually what fascinated me the most. In the beginning he is too overwhelmed with sadness to be of much help to anyone, but as Tuvia gets sicker and sicker near the end, Asael rises up and becomes a leader for the group in the time when they need a leader the most. He becomes what Tuvia was in the beginning to these people; a shining light in a time of unimaginable darkness.The characters definitely make this film the brilliant work that it is, and that is in no small part thanks to the actors who portray them. Daniel Craig finally has the chance to lead a big, widely seen epic like this, thanks to his fantastic work as the new James Bond. And he doesn't take his new status lightly, seen here in a tremendous performance. He brings so much quiet pain to Tuvia throughout the film, but he is most impressive when he lets the rage building inside him out into the open. He is mostly seen as a peaceful person who just wants to protect people, but when he lets that aggression out he is truly terrifying. Liev Schreiber's performance is the exact opposite. Although he doesn't express it in a theatric manner, for most of the film his Zus is looking for blood. It's in those quiet moments, like a relationship with a woman they saved or his breakdown after learning that his wife and child are dead, that his performance is the most impressive and is why he was the highlight of the cast. Jamie Bell is one of the best young actors working today and he proves that again with what I believe is his best performance yet. Of course they aren't the only actors in the project and everyone else, from their three love interests to all of the other unique characters living in the society they built, gives solid supporting work.Being a Zwick epic, Defiance is not only filled with layered, tragic characters but also contains a bounty of massively entertaining, beautifully orchestrated action scenes. The technical aspects, from the cinematography and score down to the sound and costume design, are all tremendous and come together to create a believable, authentic setting for these characters to make this emotional journey.",9,3,7,18 January 2009
Raging Bull," Quite ingenious.
","The only thing I would bother calling a flaw is the rather unnecessary shots randomly scattered throughout (the men fighting in the opening fight, the closeup of a teacup handle, etc.) but this can easily be looked past. This is the only time Scorsese has perfectly structured a rise and fall story. It has a beginning, middle and end yet leaves parts to the imagination. It doesn't focus too much on one era (Goodfellas in the rise, Casino in the fall), yet it never feels like it cuts anything short. De Niro is simply dynamic. He covers such a range of emotions and hits everything perfectly. The 'You *bleeped* my wife!' and the jail scenes are two of the best I've ever witnessed. I should also mention that this is the only time I haven't wanted to stab Joe Pesci in the head. He became too full of himself and type-cast in his later years, but in this he is just perfect. Moriarty is also heartbreaking and seductive. The score is flawless. It has a very elegant and nostalgic feel to it, which Scorsese crafted to a tee. The cinematography is some of the best ever, with the scenes flawlessly shot and put together.",6,2,8,8 January 2008
Iron Man," More than matched my expectations.
","Outside of Batman Begins, it's my favorite superhero movie and Downey Jr. gives my favorite performance in said genre. He took his normal hilarious personality and charisma, which works incredibly well for the character, and added touches of internal angst in the struggle of trying to make right for all the wrongs he has committed in his life. It works well as a character study of this complex man, and as a massively entertaining blockbuster. One of the most entertaining films I've seen in quite a while, and Downey Jr. kills once again. The action sours high, the characters are rich and the entire ensemble gives good support to the man of the hour. It really is Downey's film; nobody could capture this essence so perfectly and I don't think there's an actor around who I enjoy performing more than him. It's ridiculous that he actually had to fight for this role, because he is just too perfect. I'd go into more detail, but you get the picture.",10,3,7,2 May 2008
Signs," Has garnered very unnecessary hate.
","As an alien invasion film, it fails. I just couldn't really get on board with the fact that they went into their basement, fell asleep, woke up the next day and it was all over among other things. However, as a character story of a man regaining his faith, it succeeds quite well. I'm not a religious person by any means, but I admired it nonetheless. In some aspects I did really enjoy seeing an epic alien invasion as portrayed through the eyes of a simple family with no huge explosions or battles or anything like that. It made it much more suspenseful and terrifying knowing that if the aliens actually did get to them they wouldn't have a shot of fighting their way out. As Joaquin Phoenix's Merrill says 'It's war of the worlds.' but instead of epic shots of explosions and alien technology, we see the fear and hopelessness of a single family.I love how slow-burning it was as well. It takes a while to get into the actual invasion, and all of the chaos on the news channels that we see just makes it a very exciting and suspenseful journey. I thought Shyamalan handled that very well. For instance, when Merrill sees the Brazilian video with the brief shot of one of the aliens, it shocked and intrigued myself just as it did him. However in bringing up the aliens, I have to say that they looked pretty ridiculous and just far too fake. It looked like something out of a playstation one game. I also wasn't too impressed by Shyamalan's attempts at humor in the film, aside from Joaquin Phoenix. It felt too cheesy and out of place. Some of the dialogue didn't go over so well with me, but most of it was good enough. Performance-wise, Phoenix is superb and Gibson falls pretty short for the most part. The kids are fine but nothing to write home about, and Shyamalan's brief appearance is laughable just like it is in all of his films.",8,3,8,21 April 2008
Speed," A roller coaster of fun.
",Extremely fun and exhilarating throughout. Reeves and Bullock provide a rare form of chemistry that is usually lacking in the romantic side of action films. Hopper exceeds all expectations in the typical 'Insane villain' role and proves to be a joy to watch. The phrase 'Die Hard on a bus' really does apply perfectly to this one. It's a film that grasps you in the opening scene and refuses to ever let go. I knew that they were going to survive some of the scenes (i.e. Jumping the gap on the bridge) but I was still on the edge of my seat in anticipation. It's very unique for an action film to give me that kind of quality and it certainly proves to be an extremely tense and thrilling ride. Certainly one of the best of the action genre.,8,0,0,8 January 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Loses some of the classic Die Hard appeal, but thrilling nonetheless.
","One of the main appeals of the Die Hard franchise was always that it wasn't some super-spy or big badass cop taking on some superhuman bad guys. It was just an ordinary man in a small, but deadly situation. Slowly the setting has gotten larger and larger (from an office building to an airport to New York and now it's the entire nation) and that takes a little bit of the fun out of it. Also the fact that McClane is more superhuman than human (the original John McClane wouldn't have survived everything this one went through) takes a bit of the classic Die Hard feel away.It's all a little over-the-top and some of it is just too contrived to stand (the jet vs. rig was pathetic) but it still manages to be one of the most entertaining, action-packed and completely engaging action films of all time. It really perfects the type of stuff the genre has been trying to achieve this decade (the massive-scale, apocalyptic fear, technology based kind of stuff). In fact, off the top of my head only this and Shooter are the only really admirable pure action films of the decade. McClane is such a fun, mantastic character and his aging charisma makes Live Free or Die Hard an insanely enjoyable picture.Bruce Willis was born for this character and he just brings a grin to my face every time he plays him (that laugh is just perfect). Justin Long, surprisingly, is the perfect sidekick for Bruce in this one. Timothy Olyphant is a pretty lackluster villain. Too young, too dull, too annoying and too...lame. The real badass villain comes in the form of the seemingly-robotic Maggie Q who kicks a hell of a lot of ass before making her leave in my favorite scene of the entire film. All in all, it's pretty contrived and doesn't really stick to the Die Hard formula I love so much but it's still wicked entertaining and one of the best purely action films ever made.",8,0,1,8 January 2008
The Sixth Sense," I benefited a lot from revisiting it.
","I saw this film a few years ago and remembered a few scenes, but not the majority of it. The one big problem being that one of the things I did remember was the twist. So going through this re-watch it all seemed very, very obvious but that probably has a lot to do with the fact that I knew what it was. Either way, it's a good story; compelling and incredibly unique that I was able to enjoy a lot. I quite enjoyed Shyamalan's use of the color red (his use of colors in all of his films is quite extraordinary, really). The twist is a good one and adds a lot of depth to the characters, especially Malcolm, obviously. I really like the idea of him being around for the sole purpose of helping Cole learn to live with his sixth sense after being killed a year ago because he failed to help someone with the same gift. That's the twist that really made an impression on me and stunned me for a second; the fact that the man who murdered him was such a nutcase and killed him due to the fact that he had the same gift Cole has and Malcolm couldn't help him with it. I liked that complexity in the character a lot. Some of the scenes are very melodramatic and overdone and I really, really hated the editing (it was just too abrupt and out of place) but overall I thought it was compelling and the ambiance was very well structured. Toni Collette was pretty great also, especially in her final scene where Cole tells her about his gift; she was really heartbreaking there and had my eyes watering up. I think Shyamalan's masterpiece comes in his next feature, Unbreakable, but this is still a solid film that I'm glad I revisited.",9,1,1,2 April 2008
Casino," One of Scorsese's few misses.
","Another painfully dull, formulaic, rise-and-fall story. It really adds nothing new or original to the genre and featured the most disgustingly overacted performance I've seen my entire life in the form of Sharon Stone. Also, any time a film relies 90% on narration just annoys me. If I wanted that much narration, I'd get a book. You should be able to convey your story through images and character dialogue, not a constant narration with little clips of what they're talking about scattered throughout. I give it some credit for completely kicking it up six notches in the final third of the film, though. It became so much more engaging and entertaining, and Pesci and De Niro both fine tuned their performances. James Woods was also very fun to watch, but was criminally underused.",5,2,5,8 January 2008
The Thin Red Line," Malick's best.
","The first war film I've ever seen that was above average also happens to be one that I deeply love. The narration was a wonderful touch, giving a chance to become much closer to every character in the film. As the tagline says 'Every man fights his own war' and that is displayed perfectly throughout the film. Each man has his own different story. We got to see what was going through their heads as clearly as they were thinking it, and it really gave us a much more personal connection to each character, something that I always find lacking in war films. The performances are great all around, but I do wish Clooney had been a more vital role. As always with Malick, the direction and cinematography are absolutely superb. Such beautiful and striking images really set the tone for the film, and clash with the horror and brutality of war. Malick creates a contrast between nature and weaponized war, constantly switching from elegant images of nature to the terror of violence and battle.This creates one of the strongest paradoxes I've ever seen. It brings forth the question of how we could cause death and destruction while being absorbed in such beauty and wonder. The shot of the bird being hit by a bullet seems pointless at first, but it is really a contrast between nature's relation to life and man's association with death. The effect of man on nature is one of brutality (the constant fires and explosions) while the effect of nature on man is one of therapeutic absorption, displayed through Caviezel as he swims with the children in the water with a vibrant smile on his face and playful laughs surrounding him. Caviezel can handle all of the pain and bloodshed of war due to his connection with nature. The water cleanses him of sins and stress, in what I saw as a metaphor for baptism. The final image is one of optimism, showing that even though man took a heavy toll on it, the beauty of nature will live on.",10,2,5,9 January 2008
Gangs of New York," Grandiose.
","While I do have some complaints with the way that Scorsese handled the film's style I found it to be a very enjoyable film highlighted by one of the finest performances of all time. The editing during the fight scenes happens way too quickly and becomes convoluted, and the way that he introduced us to the era seemed far too rushed and never really let us understand the surroundings that we were placed in. The script does a good job of explaining the politics of the time period and what was happening in New York at that time in history, but the introduction to it all felt really forced and rushed. But once I got used to that, it was quite easy to immerse myself into the setting. The art direction and costume design is phenomenal and all of the actors do a great job of making us feel like we're there with them.In order for me to like a film I have to like the story and Gangs of New York has the benefit of being a sensational, almost Shakespearean, tragedy which I absolutely adore. The story centers around Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) who, as a child, sees his father slain in battle by the menacing Bill 'The Butcher' Cunning (Daniel Day-Lewis). He flees the scene and lives at the church for sixteen years before returning to the place where his father died and is re-introduced to the world that he once knew which is almost exactly the same, with the addition Bill running everything with an iron fist. Amsterdam succeeds in becoming a close associate of Bill's, eventually becoming basically his right-hand man and saving his life at one point. He does all of this for the chance to avenge his father and murder The Butcher in cold blood. As I said, the story is very Shakespearean and that's what I love about it and that's why the ending was a bit of a let-down. It doesn't follow continue with it's tragedy roots and that disappointed me but it was still handled quite nicely.Of course with Daniel Day-Lewis being my favorite actor and his extremely strong selection process I'm more than likely going to adore his performance, and that's very true for his portrayal of Bill. His brooding intensity, flawless accent and ability to strike cold fear into someone while saying the most polite things truly make it one of the most astonishing performances of all time. Just plain brilliant. Everyone else in the cast is quite nice; DiCaprio is great, Diaz is above average, John C. Reilly and Brendan Gleeson provide fine support but it's ultimately Daniel's show and he amazes us as always. Overall, Gangs of New York really is a great film, regardless of some flaws scattered along the way, which follows a brilliant story and holds one of the finest performances of all time.",9,2,4,18 December 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Greengrass ups the style of this remarkable franchise.
","One of the few instances of a sequel being superior to it's original. The Bourne Supremacy increases the action and deepens the story that the original mastered. The action is much grittier, crisp and natural. The performances are the same, notably Damon's who fine tunes his amnesia into a sense of dedicated revenge. Joan Allen was perfectly casted in a performance made to rival Brian Cox's commanding drive. Joan Allen really commands the screen every time she is on, much like she does in every role. She was prefect for the part. The car chase is the greatest I've ever seen. It's wonderfully authentic and realistic. Paul Greengrass was perfect for directing this film. His gritty, hand-held style makes it feel like you are there watching the action occur, most notably performed during the fight between Bourne and the last Treadstone assassin with the magazine. Julia Stiles' wonderful performance should also be mentioned. My only big complaint is that Karl Urban butchers Russian whenever he speaks it, getting most of his lines wrong. Still the epitome of the espionage thriller and one of the best films of the packed 2004.",9,3,4,9 January 2008
Valkyrie," Intense, but a lack of dimension in the characters.
","Valkryie is a relatively intense thriller with an ending that we all know going into it, but that doesn't make it any less suspenseful. Well...maybe a little less suspenseful, but not significantly. The film has one fatal flaw though and that's it's complete lack of focus on it's characters. Bryan Singer made a decision to focus almost entirely on the attempted assassination on Hitler to the point where by the end we don't even know who these characters, aside from Stauffenberg, were that conspired to bring down Hitler. As far as I'm concerned, they were just a bunch of strangers in a room. The performances were good, giving each character a certain amount of presence, but after it all I still don't know who these men were. Tom Cruise definitely commanded the film with a driven performance that made him the high point of the picture, for me. And in the end, despite the lack of layers or exploration into the characters, the story still managed to be very suspenseful which made it fun to watch. And that ending was devastating.",Null,8,17,31 December 2008
All the President's Men," The perfect embodiment of one of America's most captivating stories.
","A taut political thriller about two men who rose up and uncovered the truth behind a wall of conspiracy. It's suspenseful and very engaging, but I do wish it would have spent more time on the personal lives and the emotions that Bernstein and Woodward must have been going through. But when you have that many facts to go over in a two and half hour film, your main focus definitely becomes getting the facts and adrenaline of the story and this film perfectly nails that. It gets us to cheer when they cheer and to be disappointed when they are, which is what any good film should do. We become emotionally involved with these characters. There are a lot of names flying around at high speeds though so if you aren't informed on the Watergate Scandal, you may get a little lost (thankfully for me I find it to be one of the most interesting events ever) but it's nothing too terrible. The performances really shine; Hoffman and Redford are phenomenal and Jason Robards (who won an Oscar for his performance) and Hal Holbrook steal every scene they're in.",9,2,3,8 January 2008
High Fidelity," Flawless.
","It's very rare for me to start a film and within the first ten or fifteen minutes fall completely head over heels in love with it. High Fidelity transcends this rarity. Within mere seconds, my eyes were glued and my jaw was dropped by how incredibly in love with it I became. Everything from the wild performances to the wonderful moral to the flawless soundtrack was absolutely perfect. It's a film about maturing and realizing that nothing is the way you want it to be, so you need to learn how to settle. It also happens to be one of the most enjoyable films of all time.This modern tale of growing up takes place under the story of a breakup and one man's desperate need to discover why his partners always go right from him to someone else. Over the first thirty or so minutes, Rob Gordon (John Cusack) goes through his all-time, top-five most memorable breakups and we see that each one of them ended because the girl chose someone else over him (except for the one that he broke up with due to her lack of sexual promiscuity; immediately after their split she slept with a guy). The film begins with the newest breakup, Laura (Iben Hjejle) who we soon find out is now bedding Ian (Tim Robbins), more commonly referred to as Ray. This sends him into a reassessment of his own life and he decides to find these other four women and figure out why they chose someone else over him.In doing this, he discovers that these women weren't what he remembered them to be. They are extremely flawed individuals whom he wouldn't want to take back, even if they wanted him back. This sparks his realization that all of his fantasies of what his dream life should be and how perfect everything is in his mind is never really the truth. He slowly accepts that in the real world he has to settle constantly and nothing can be completely perfect. No matter what, every element of life has it's flaws and every relationship has bumps to get past. He had been putting all of these ex-girlfriends up on a pedestal and it took this revelation in order to bring them down. Due to this realization, he was finally able to move on with his life and actually mature instead of remaining in the constant void of unrequited fantasies he had trapped himself in.I'm not one for spoiling endings, but I have to say that High Fidelity features one of the most satisfying finales as far as I'm concerned. Rob's newfound maturity and ability to move on with his life, along with a wonderful decision from a certain someone, does nothing but bring an enormous smile to my face. A lot of this enjoyment comes from the satisfaction achieved by one of the most relatable characters in film history. Rob is easily a character that very closely resembles my own self in so many ways. It goes beyond his excellent taste in music and the fact that he builds up fantasies that are far more perfect than any thing could realistically become to the smallest elements of his life like his trivial tendency to make 'Top 5' lists on the most insignificant things. I can find so much in myself that is similar to Rob, so watching him succeed in life almost gives me a sense that I can eventually succeed as well.Something I've always said when it comes to film is that my favorite elements belong to the story and the characters. High Fidelity excels in both of these categories by an immense proportion. The story is inspirational and highly engaging with deep characters who entrance you and keep you glued to the screen. Rob's riffs to the audience are brilliant and range from being absolutely heart-shattering to side-splitting hilarity. Speaking of hilarity, comic relief has never tasted as sweet as the combination of Dick and Barry, the two employees at the record store Rob owns played impeccably by Todd Louiso and Jack Black respectively. The three of them bounce off one another seamlessly and give a pure sense of authenticity and keep the laughs coming in this wonderful tale. All of the performances are just as strong as the rest of the film, but the highlight is clearly from the anchor John Cusack. He's also been an actor I felt I could relate to and in becoming this character that relatability only increases massively. He hits such a range of emotion and becomes this character so flawlessly that it seems as if Stephen Frears just put a camera on him and told him to say whatever he wants. A perfect performance highlighting a perfect film.",10,1,3,27 October 2007
