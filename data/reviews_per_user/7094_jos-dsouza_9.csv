Hereditary," What did I just see?
","I am zapped by those reviewers who have rated this movie 5 or above. I wonder what movie they saw!!! 
This movie was terrible. I mean, what were they trying to show or tell? The plot is lost. There are absolutely no horror moments (isn't that what is expected in a horror movie?) and the ending is lame and stupid. Someone crowned as king of devils!! It couldn't get more stupid. I actually dozed thrice during the movie and was woken up by my wife. 
Skip it or watch it if you cannot sleep. It is a good alternative to a sleeping pill.",1,28,65,17 June 2018
A Star Is Born," Delusional
","This movie is a sore. Come on....an alcoholic who has not control over his actions and ends his life as a loser with no consideration for his wife and loved ones, deserves no sympathy.
In todays world, this movie has no significance. The level heads people, please skip this. It s a sore.",1,7,20,18 November 2018
Us," This movie is a disaster
","Please done go by the high ratings. This movie is a disaster. The plot and storyline are all confusing, When you think its all over, some thing new comes up. This is a movie where the kids do exactly opposite of what the parents say. Someone is addicted to mask. Some one has to explain what home alone is. Phew. Bad screenplay, worse dialogues and the cast and acting is totally mediocre.
It was tiring watching this and a total waste of time. Please skip this.",1,3,5,25 May 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," For whom was this movie made?
","If this movie is for the kids, I doubt if any of them will even understand the plot and the purported humor. They tried to complicate the plot too much.
So it is the adults who are going ga ga over a kids movie. So much for the purpose. But who cares when the box office cash is flowing.
I found the plot to be mushed and too complicated. The animation seemed blurred in many places. I dont know if that was the intention. And the 3D effects are nothing to rave about. Very Ordinary.There are far better 3D animation movies out there and I wont rate this in the list of Top-10 3D animated movies..",1,18,67,18 January 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Why the hype?
","While I respect the fans going ga ga and people discussing the emotions etc, I beg to differ. I saw this movie yesterday after all the rush had died out. There were about 25-30 people in the Audi having seating capacity of approx 250.Pace: The buildup is slow and boring.Emotions: Forced and sometimes looks very artificial. You don't feel a thing. When some people said that they cried, I wonder for what. Action: It comes late and is limited. I expected more (isnt that expected in the avengers movies?)CGI: Was good.Storyline: Very weak. It could have been refined. Many of the characters were inserted and wasted.Length: It was unnecessarily prolonged, esp towards the end. They could have reduced the runtime by 20-30 minutes.Overall: Bad. Barely a one time watch, with lots of patience. The studios have created the hype and made their money. The previous avenger movie was way better. This one was a totally let down, just like the Game of Thrones final season.",1,196,341,17 May 2019
Midsommar," Deserves a ZERO
","This over two hour disaster of a movie makes absolutely no sense.
The female lead can't sleep without taking a sleeping pill. And in the process puts us all in deep slumber.
The plot just didn't make any meaning or sense, Come on...atleast try to give some meaning to the movie. Its so jumbling, looks like the writers and producers had smoked pot during the making of this disaster.
Don't be mislead by any of the high ratings. It smells worse than than pigs fart.",1,18,30,12 October 2019
The Shape of Water," One of the worst movies
","What did I just see? This is one of the worst movies. The high ratings are totally misleading. The moment it turned to a sexual relationship between the lady and the alien, the whole plot was lost. Totally gross. A Stupid, senseless movie and trust me it will get to your nerves. Skip this.",1,6,25,13 January 2018
Parasite," Less than Ordinary .. plain stupid
","I just cannot understand the reason for such a high rating this movie has got. It is a less than ordinary movie.
A family getting employment using fraud means and in the process kicking out the honest ones. No laughing matter.
And the violence they unleash to stop getting exposed, is hard to comprehend.
The old housekeeper is killed mercilessly by this family to protect themselves.
And in the end, when one of them kills his own employer, whatever the reasoning..it spoilt to all.
The second half and esp the end are horrible. The movie made no sense.",4,10,40,12 January 2020
Green Book," This movie is a winner
","If I could sum it in one word it will be : Fabulous.
Seen a lot of movies showing the Black and White divide. Most of them were overdramatic. But this one is subtle, peaceful and a pleasure to watch.
We have the white guy who takes no non-sense and the black guy, the pianist, who endures everything with grace. And in the end we see the white guy mellow down and the pianist rebel and both enjoying the change.
A very well made movie with no preaching or over dramatism.
This ones a winner.",9,5,11,5 January 2019
