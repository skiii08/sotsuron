Black Swan," I cannot stand such type of story telling
","Absolutely disgusting plot for one crazy girl who is in the pursuit of her mad ambition to be honored with the leading role as Prima balerina. All the time bloody scenes, some horrible visions and so on. I felt sick almost as of the first 15-20 minutes and wanted to pu.... as she did a lot of times. I cannot believe such a poor story was given 8 for rating. Surely, somebody will try to convince me that Natalie totally sink into her role and performance deserves outstanding rating. However, this movie gave me nothing more than strange feeling, dull feeling, negative energy which I need some time to transform and recover my normal condition. I am not sure what kind of people would 'like' or moreover 'enjoy' watching this 'Drama'. I am really sorry to waste my time and watch this complete chaos, mess. I hope such type of movies not get credit by audience and not being produced at all. This is all personal opinion, so not forcing anyone to agree with me/it.",1,5,9,6 February 2015
Django Unchained," This is really FAR BEYOND EVER BOUNDARIES
","I don't approve slavery and my people from Bulgaria were enslaved for about 500 years by Turks, also called Osman Empire ( 14-19 century). I hate scenes of brutal violence, although pretty sure everything is done during years of slavery. This so called 'movie' makes me feel absolutely sick and aggressive. If you are seeking for repentance from Americans.. This is the most DUMB and inappropriate way of doing it - Black rap music, black action hero, who shot 100000 men, cause he is too smart and kick as...s. The worst character for Leo Di Caprio, although he is as always brilliant. I totally disapprove such type of movies and all this HATEEEEE Mr. Tarantino... and all like you. What is the point ? To show human insanity and brutality treating other people like animals? Yet, playing classical and rap music... This movie is complete mess...absolute .. If you are trying to bring audience attention in this way...Well, you are pretty low .. All people, from all races, all mankind history is full of such brutal moments and inhumanity..... Shall we picture more scenes and movies showing that side of human nature ? Of course with BLACK RAP MUSIC and COOL Gangster-HEROES? Shall we build Hollywood in every continent, so we can make money of the most dark ages of human kind ? Can you make it more brutal and full of violence ? Your movie I mean... I vote 1....cause cant vote with ' - 10 '. This is what your movie deserve..Absolutely, disgusted after seen it...",1,19,31,16 March 2014
