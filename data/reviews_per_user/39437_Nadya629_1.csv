The Ring," Most suspenseful, least bloody horror movie since the original Halloween
","The Ring is, in my opinion, the most suspenseful, least bloody horror movie since the original Halloween.  Quick synopsis: a journalist's niece dies and in the course of trying to find out what killed her, discovers a videotape that, once viewed, seems to cause the death of the viewer one week to the moment of viewing.  The journalist (of course) views the tape, and then has 7 days to discover the origins of the tape and end the 'curse.'  From the hair raising opening when the niece's friend tells the 'urban legend' of the tape to just about the end, this movie is very well put together, leading us from one discovery to the other, and leaving no unanswered questions that I noticed.  My only quibble is with the last two seconds of the movie.  I thought they were cheesy.  Overall, a really good movie.  See it.",9,0,0,26 September 2002
