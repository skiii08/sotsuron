Blade Runner 2049," A fine comeback, but tiring!
","Thirty-five years onward since Ridley Scott's 1982 original Blade Runner hit theatres, now the long awaited sequel finally comes out. The question stands 'was it worth the wait?' Blade Runner 2049 opens to an amazing soundtrack from the talents of composer Hans Zimmer, followed by a fabulous production design with an amazing visual style (more advanced and modern than the original). So far, this gives the audience a hint that there are numerous doors left open for a possible expanded universe, which is, by far, cool! Expectations are huge and satisfactory, but 2049 suffers from a story-line that could have been shortened down from its overlong 163 minutes run-time to the 117 minutes of the 1982 original. It's basically an overlong police procedural episode that is totally unnecessary. While the visual effects and style is nothing short of amazing, the plot can easily make audiences feel less about the movie, followed by boredom. The performances of Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford (whom has limited screen time) are fine, but this isn't enough to overcome what is tiring about the movie; and considering it's poor box-office performance at the weekend, the release of future sequels might be unlikely, but never say never. Plus, the movie lacks action scenes, as did the original and I feel a movie called 'Blade Runner' (and given its premise) should have more action scenes. The chances of this happening in future sequels is anyone's guess.",5,9,18,11 October 2017
Skyfall," Bond crisscrosses the globe yet again!
","Skyfall, the third movie starring Daniel Craig as Bond, is a sequel made to be just as compelling as the older movies; but nevertheless Skyfall ignores the events of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace and takes place sometime later. The events of the last two movies are non-existent in this follow-up as there is no given detail of what had happened thereafter. Nevertheless, Skyfall manages to tell a new story in Bond's life and this sequel really explores the character both physically and emotionally, which wasn't really done a lot in the older movies. The well written script and action sequences are terrific, but towards the second half of the movie, story becomes very weak, but there is enough throwbacks and an explosive action-packed finale to get viewer's attention and the lust for another Bond sequel.",5,1,2,9 November 2015
The Day After Tomorrow," This disaster movie is not one of the best!
","Out of Jake Gyllenhaal's finest movies and roles, The Day After Tomorrow is, exceptionally, the worst I've seen. It's fair to say it's not his movie, it centres around a science professor played by Dennis Quaid, who predicts an earth catastrophe that is near - which includes tsunamis, snow storms and, ultimately a second ice age - but neither the characters nor the plot itself are in any way interesting. It's tragically bent on clichés. The direction of Roland Emmerich isn't good, nor is the dodgy screenplay, dialogue, nor the characters - and the irritating clichés even include ridiculous lack of character development - even our lead actor, whom is Dennis Quaid, portrays his science professor in way to convince the audience that he's more interested in the safety of his son (Gyllenhaal), in the tragic ice age, than of the many millions of hopeless survivors living in the States.",4,1,5,6 March 2015
Justice League," Visually great, though at mediocre standards!
","Though, it's worth noting Justice League deserves credit for cutting down its run-time to 120 minutes precise, so there's no overuse of length of boredom to tire the audience to death, but this movie still suffers from multiple errors. There is plenty of room for character introductions, but Justice League suffers ludicrously from lengthy, obscure dialogue - mainly from the Flash - but one might argue the problematic misuse of this is due to writing issues of the movie. Like previous instalments: Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice and Man of Steel, Justice League - amongst the front runners in the DCEU - continue to suffer from poor direction. Plus, Diane Lane's brief presence as Martha Kent is weaker than ever, following her weak portrayal in Batman V Superman and Man of Steel. I believe her weak portrayal in these movies is the error of the writers. Arguably, one might expect to see the return of Kevin Costner and Russel Crowe, in their respective roles as Clarke's biological and earth fathers. Plus, Superman's return is nothing exciting, nor is the brief portrayal of Henry Cavill, which is a large step back from his portrayal in the previous movies. Though, the visual effects are mediocre and decent, there is enough writing errors to go around here that puts the movie down. Considering its poor box-office performance so far, it's errors and financial performance may very well affect the rest of the DCEU.",4,2,10,26 November 2017
Quantum of Solace," Lack of story and lazily paced!
","A promising direct sequel to the classic 2006 Casino Royale, is what fans hoped for, but sadly not. Quantum of Solace lacks what made Casino Royale a noteworthy reboot to the Bond series. Solace basically covers all the areas of flaws from fast and lazily edited action scenes to fast and lazy pacing - followed by poor production material. It was no doubt, a rushed project. Though, the whole intriguing background of the Quantum organisation (the main worldwide terrorist organisation in the movie) is interesting and offers many expectations, there doesn't seem to be enough here to arouse satisfaction, as the movie also suffers from lack of character development. Also, the new villain Dominic Greene, played by Mathieu Amalric, is a top member of Quantum and an oil businessman, but no were near one of the finest Bond villains. Given its shortened run-time of 104 minutes (making it the shortest Bond movie to date), there's not even enough development for familiar faces returning from Casino Royale: Judi Dench, Jeffrey Wright, Jesper Christensen and Giancarlo Giannini. Overall, Quantum of Solace was rushed due to the Writer's Strike of 2007-08. Following the success of the next Bond movies, Skyfall and SPECTRE, there will always be another Bond adventure!",4,0,2,24 October 2017
Drive," A genre-defining masterwork!
","Ryan Gosling and Director Nicholas Winding Refn are in for a career best piece of masterwork in 'Drive!' It is an absolute genre-defining masterpiece, offering limitless set pieces, character development and gritty action. Also, a classy soundtrack and heartfelt presence. Without giving too much away, Ryan Gosling is a Hollywood stunt performer credited as 'Driver.' He is a jaw-dropping presence in the movie, as the main storyline goes into play. With a great performance from supporting leads: Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Oscar Isaac and Albert Brooks, the main plot includes a failed heist and subsequent actions leading to gritty circumstances. Ryan Gosling's mysterious 'Driver' steals the show with his unique portrayal and set of skills.The relationship between Gosling and Mulligan is so melodramatic, especially with his connection to her young son. Though Gosling's gritty approach of his role suggests 'Driver' has a dark and sufferable past, it is seemingly not enough to secure a relationship between the pair - especially when Gosling has one last up front score to settle with villainous mobster Albert Brooks. Nicholas Winding Refn offers a lot of magnificent attributes to being an achievable filmmaker here. He accomplishes this by delivering a unique, questionable, intense and gritty action thriller that will leave audiences on the edge of their seat.",10,19,25,19 March 2018
Enemy at the Gates," Fine production material but not much drama.
","Though I am very interested in the history of World War II and its biggest incidents and battles, sadly Enemy at the Gates did not live hot to my expectations of a noteworthy adaptation of the Battle of Stalingrad.Jude Law is a fine actor, as are notable additions: Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz and Ed Harris. Though some top cast movies can fall flat and sadly I believe this is one of them.There is enough production material from the rubble of Stalingrad to make this movie watchable, as well as soldier customs and weapons for props, but there is not enough drama as the story flows, to make Enemy At the Gates a worthwhile WWII adaptation.Also, with the limited number of snipers featured in the movie, Enemy At the Gates comes across as disappointing as the actual history involved multiple sniper regiments and many high class snipers. So, it is unfortunate to say that Jude Law plays a an excellent sniper fighting a one-man war through the rubble of Stalingrad, with no sign of many other snipers.",5,0,0,6 June 2020
Whiplash," Best achievement in Sound Editing of the year!
","Whiplash is an extraordinary achievement in filmmaking and totally unmissable! Who thought J.K Simmons would have been offered a role eligible for an Oscar win? Nobody - but that's not the point; the movie is mesmerising to its own extent and outweighs the boundaries of sound editing to a unique and powerhouse level. With so much pleasure to keep the audience glued to their seats, Whiplash is a fascinating tale about a passionate drummer called Andrew (played by Miles Teller) - who's undying dream is to become a musician as a drummer, even if he has to go off the deep end by severely injuring himself, in practise, which he, ultimately, does, when music professor, Fletcher, abusively doubts his talents. It's a careers best for J.K Simmons, whom delivers a masterful performance as Fletcher, as he horribly abuses the students in his music class, in order to make them successful and talented musicians - but Fletcher is not to be messed with. Miles Teller also delivers a mesmerising performance as the young master drummer, Andrew, whom will stop at nothing and will cross boundaries, even with Fletcher, to achieve his dream. It's one of my favourite movies of the year and of all time - and an extraordinary new achievement in filmmaking!",10,2,4,2 March 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," An epic Nutshell of flaws!
","Though, it can't be deemed one of the worst science fiction, fantasy movies, it is certainly not the best Star Wars movie. The third entry in George Lucas' epic prequel trilogy may offer plenty of iconic and enjoyable moments, but there is also a lot of flaws that overwhelm the movie completely. Unlike the fine pacing of the previous two movies, Revenge of the Sith is very slow and, though there is plenty of action scenes and light-sabre duels, it doesn't live up to the other instalments, nor does it live up to the continuity of the classic original trilogy. The screenplay by George Lucas is not great and the love triangle between Anakin and Padme is just as boring and lame as ever. The overuse of silly dialogue is just tiring and the slow character development is nothing essential compared to the memorable characters of the original trilogy. The performance of Ian McDiarmid as the villainous Chancellor Palpatine/Emperor is excellent and noteworthy, and, arguably, the most iconic performance of Prequels. Other creditable performers I would add Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, as well as Frank Oz as Master Yoda. On the weaker side: Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman. Though, I believe most of the flaws of the movie is due to the poor screenplay.It is worth noting Revenge of the Sith is the ultimatum Star Wars movie of action sequences. Features the closing chapter of the Clone Wars, General Grievous, a brief appearance of Count Dooku, the advancement of dark side and the fall of the Jedi. This all sums up to making Revenge of the Sith the most explosive, action-packed Star Wars movie yet.",6,1,2,27 December 2017
Halloween," The Night Terror Came Home!
","Suspenseful in every way possible, John Carpenter's Halloween is a classic! An unforgettable, jaw-dropping, suspenseful masterpiece. Featuring a talented cast, including Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence.Halloween begins with main antagonist Michael Myers, whom after murdering his sister on Halloween night (1963), returns home on the same night - fifteen years later - to resume his killing spree, following his escape from Warren County Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Pleasence's Dr Loomis is hot on his trail and will stop at nothing to track down his former patient.Halloween sets a new bar for the horror and suspense genre and will keep audiences on the edge of their seat from start to finish. The cinematography and the well-paced screenplay is pleasing in many ways, as every suspenseful moment is captured so professionally. Every scene offers intriguing moments and keeps the viewer brainstorming, throughout, to find out what the main antagonist, Myers, is up against and when he will make his move.Throughout, viewers will also be tuned into the classic, creepy soundtrack of the movie. There is a lot to enjoy here and Halloween is recommendable for everyone whom is a devoted fan to the horror and suspense genre.",8,0,0,31 October 2017
