United 93," A Devastating Docudrama Examining Chaos and Self Preservation
","No words can describe this powerful examination of September 11th. This film grips you with its relentless real time expose of how the dramatic events of September the eleventh unfolded.. We are immediately introduced to the hijackers and passengers of Flight 93 then swept into the boiler rooms of America's skys led by Ben Sliney the Federal Aviation Administration Boss as himself .. From here we are introduced to the detailed chaos of traffic control following the increasing anomolaic movement of rogue numbers across a VDU.. with a gradual realisation of something new in conflict ! This is captured by the hectic audio mix of the control rooms and plane all aiding the cinematic style, creating a unified and consistent feel for the filmWith secure knowledge of the what happened you cannot help but as a viewer grab control of the situation as The Army and American Airways fail to cope with the escalating chaos.. We spend time with the controllers as they track there targets until they simply disappear not realising the enormity of the situation.. Greengrass creates a feel of dread throughout, There is an ever growing urgency and with the backdrop of the world trade centre in smoke a sense of impending doom as communication breaks down to a bare silence . This is an astoundingly tense pressure cooker of a movie with a realism that pulls you in. Greengrass develops this tension with an intense soundtrack that ticks like a bomb...and a with quick egdy cutting creates an ever growing unease. United 93 is shot entirely with hand held cameras perfectly capturing the realism of the events placing you behind a seat on the doomed plane or in the military command room.. And what makes it more effective is his choice of Casting, throughout no recognized actors or big names..An uncompromising piece of film making on how a super power fails to cope with unprecedented events and the examination of self preservation Powerful Stuff",10,1,2,2 June 2006

Pan's Labyrinth," Stunning Imaginative and complete ! Del Torro's Masterpiece

The Hurt Locker," Cracking Action War Film with a message
","This is simply a belter of a movie .. Using the unsung heroes of Iraqs Bomb Disposal unit and some relentless set pieces this film sucks you in gargles you then spits you out leaving you with an emphatic message.. WAR IS A DRUG FOR SOME.... Following one of the most riveting and unsuspecting open sequences I have seen in ages we follow the maverick Sargeant Willaim James take on anything the Bombers/terrorists can throw at him. The director succeeds in her portrayal of Iraq as am impossible environment to work in,, the claustrophobia and unnerving constant threat of suicide bombers is delt with true realism.. There is no political message more a message of how soldiers live for risk and adrenalin .. and how adjusting to civilian life can be impossible,, The film succeeds by continually cranking up the tension as the two hours breeze by.. Sure there are some plot holes but remember its a movie and I guarantee you will stay with this one throughout the ride ! It will simply blow you away !!!",9,54,85,10 February 2009
Mystic River," Gripping Intense Drama spoilt by ending !
","I thought Mystic River was a good film and a lot better than the hugely over rated 'Unforgiven' but nowhere near an excellent film, (Why not try 'The Pledge')  The opening scene was terrific and the menacing kidnap set the scene for the ensuing story which offered so much and indeed delivered until the ridiculous end  !The acting was good apart from Tim Robbins and his wife, who need to understand that viewers are not to keen on 'overacting'Location was excellent and the feel was great, especially the sweeping night shots from the Mystic River .. and why the reference anyway ?And why hit us with the ridiculous deep and unrealistic schmaltz speech at the end , drawing close to the rocket science, introspective neurosis, deep thinking that  most American child actors seem to adopt ! and unbelievable murderThat said I certainly enjoyed this cinematic experience and found the originality of the story and setting most appealing, and the characters engaging  7/10 !!!",7,0,0,28 October 2003
Casino Royale," James Bond .. Relatively Stirred not Shaken (SPOILERS)
","Watched this on Wednesday at a Ford Screening in London and came out feeling fairly satisfied with this latest offering from the Broccolis .. A complex tale of intrigue, middle men, money laundering , and Gambling at the Casino Royale with Daniel Craig in his first outing as Bond ! James Bond. The film engages you from the off with the usual whambamb action man sequences, the relentless set pieces are more like an Indiana Jones movie, dramatically spiced up with the Parkour free style running, edgy imaginative sets and use of height to scare the Living Daylights out of you !! .. Forget the popcorn you need a dozen red bull to keep u going in this energy sapping intro ! So what now for Bond well he keeps on going unbelievable so, and morphs into Bruce Willis in Die Hard with a Vengeance in an elaborate if not overly long Airport action scene which includes wait for it,, wait for it celebrity placement .. yes forget Sony, Rolex or Gucci ,, try Richard Branson !! The dialogue is minimal and the action is to the Max !!! So now we are in Montenegro and the intrigue begins with an exhausted Bond who decides to confront the kingpin of terrorist Money Laundering Chifre or as I know him Tommy out of The much acclaimed Danish pusher Trilogy .. It moves from the Motorway to the pedestrian sidewalk and ambles on with recurring exchanges between Bond and Chifre over a tense game of Poker playing for Zillions of money.We are reminded of Bonds new darker violent side with scenes of sporadic violence which keeps the interest level above freezing as it moves closer to the two hour mark To be honest it never gets boring and is more than watchable but you begin to wonder and ask questions,, who is that ?? What is going on,, ? Are you joking ? the film becomes disjointed in places and the plot holes become an irritation and the cheesy lovey dovey scenes should have been shot at Dawn.. Do these people ever learn !!! The impressively imaginative finale on the 2hour 25 mark re energises the movie as the sparring moves to a Sinking venetion House with Bond evading more bullets than your typical Zombie !!! Entertaining enough",6,1,2,28 November 2006
Dodgeball," Truly Awful
","As a somewhat pretentious film buff who prefers to dissect movies and observe Editing, camera work, quality acting, interesting story lines etc I decided to give this a chance as Mr Stiller gave us classics like Meet the Parents, and Zoolander , however this was from the outset a shocking experience,,, having to pretend not to be a paedophile in the queue from the eternal munching of popcorn, nachos and mindless laughter from a very low IQ sect of people. The film was certainly no Dumb and Dumber but truly awful, acting was shocking, normal Stiller , story was pish and the comedy nilPLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS FILM",Null,2,6,10 September 2004
The Fighter," Disappointing and Nauseating and unengaging
","This was such a let down, am I the only person who sees through the hype. The film starts with a funky bouncy walk down the street . It promises so much however ends up so flat, It's like a predictable TV movie lacking any punch and when the predictable love interest and the overbearing family arrive on the scene it dissolves into a 12 round slug fest, dead on the canvas all the characters are annoying and there is more shouting than a Jerry Springer movie.. I wish Christian Bale and the whole family would just OD immediately Some of the reviews have the audacity to put it in the same ring as Raging Bull ,,,, eh get a life. (And lets not forget about the schmalzy American Rock soundtrack - dire It was dull,, unengaging and ultimately predictable tosh,,, I would rather watch Rocky 10 Intacto I can steal your luck",1,24,50,21 January 2011
Atonement," Reviewers must Atone for their sins ....
","I have rarely complained about specific reviews, ., however through utter astonishment at reading Empires Helen O'Haras recent verdict of Atonement as being 'a masterpiece' (Is she on the books of British Film incorporated !!!,) , including comments such as 'near faultless performances' , 'complex', 'devastating' and 'best Picture'... . Her credibility as a quality reviewer of film has been severely damaged by this overtly Patriotic analysis ,, I was expecting to see something between Lawrence of Arabia and The English Patient and was given a beautifully shot Lynda La Plante TV drama ,, was so disappointed , and like most of the cinema's whispers on the verge of walking out this snobbish middle brow drama,, .... Basically all dramatic tension is lost in the second act when the action moves to the bigger canvas of the war in France ,, James McEvoy's accent failed and his presence weakened any scene and where does one start with Ikea Knightley .. shocking.... Is it possible Empire can ask Helen to take off her ' English Rose' tinted spectacles and read a proper and accurate review of this 'tosh' by Cosmo Landesman's cutting and on the ball review in the Sunday Times .",4,27,54,9 September 2007
