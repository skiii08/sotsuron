The Longest Yard," A very entertaining movie, but
","They used WAY too many racial jokes in this movie. I can definitely see a lot of people disliking the movie because of this, but as a big Adam Sandler fan the movie as a whole lived up to expectations. My only 2 gripes are Chris Rock's character which was funny at times and hard to watch at others, and the over usage of race to get cheap laughs (which worked for those around me) I give it a 6/10-------------------- ------------- --------------- ----------- ------- ----------------- ------------- ---------------- ------- -------------- ---------- --------------- ------------ ------ ----------- -------------- ---------- --------------- ------------- They used WAY too many racial jokes in this movie.
