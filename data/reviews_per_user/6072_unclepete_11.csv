Casablanca," I've never met anyone who didn't like Casablanca.
","I could say so much but it's all been said already. If you think you won't like this film then change your mind - you will. It's utterly effortless to watch with a bunch of characters that you can't help but like.You will probably be able to name a film that you think is better, but nothing is as universally liked as Casablanca.Perfection.",Null,0,0,17 December 2000
12 Angry Men," Courtroom Drama with a difference...
","Ever since I got my fingers burned with 'The Graduate', I've been just a little wary of films that are considered revered classics on imdb. I didn't need to have any fears about this one!It really is a courtroom drama with a difference. We don't see the presentation of the case, there is no damning evidence produced at the last minute by sleight of hand, we don't have the oh-so-intense barrister getting the hard-headed witness to crack on the stand (but don't get me wrong, I loved 'A Few Good Men'!)What I like most of all is that, just like the jury, we don't ever find out if the defendant really is guilty or not.As a film, this is a work of craftsmanship. As so many have said, when you can't bank on special effects or locations, it's down to great writing and great acting, and this film has both in spades.It's basically a character study, and a fabulous demonstration of group dynamics. Whatever your preferred genre, this film is a must have your collection.Dare I say flawless?",9,0,1,22 April 2003
The Princess Bride," Similar to 'Spinal Tap'...really?
","This film is a wonderful piece of work by Reiner. His 'Spinal Tap' movie is considered by many to be one of the greatest rock movies ever, even though it is a spoof! In many ways, Reiner has pulled the same trick here. The middle eighties was a brave time to film a fairy story, and it would have been so easy to go for a slick, urbane allegorical story set in Manhattan or some such. Reiner goes the other way, and parodies the fairy tale genre, ramping it up and camping it up with ridiculous characters and settings. This gung-ho larger than life approach has given us a wonderful fantasy with heroes we love to love and villians we love to hate. And whoever penned the line '...with eyes like the sea after a storm' please make themselves known. Call me an old romantic, but I would lay down and die for any girl who said that about me :-)",Null,1,2,19 September 2001
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Great, but the story deserved better direction.
","I've got to say that I saw this tonight and I loved it. It's a very powerful, very well made film but it had a good Director and deserved a great one.I'd have dearly loved to have seen it filmed in German and subtitled, but accepting that that won't happen, I applaud the decision to go for almost perfect received pronunciation rather than German accented English which would have been beyond awful.For me, the bugbear was the music. Herman directed both Little Voice and Brassed Off - the man KNOWS how to use music effectively (Danny Boy in the latter film still makes be cry like a baby). The climax to this film however felt ham-fisted. The orchestration completely drowned the moment where I feel a much more restrained hand would have had greater emotional impact. Much of the rest of the score was fabulous.In the acting stakes, I think the ladies won the day, with both Amber Beattie and Vera Farmiga giving performances that were a joy to watch.A great film, but it could have been better.",8,1,3,7 October 2008
Mission: Impossible II," The franchise deserved better.
","As many have said, this is a mind numbing action flick. The first film had great characters, a great plot full of duplicity and subterfuge and wonderfully atmospheric locations. The sequel has...nothing.As an action film, it represents its genre respectably enough (though Woo has done a lot better) but as a sequel to M:I, this movie stinks.Hard to recommend.",Null,0,0,30 June 2001
Once Upon a Time in America," Protracted and self indulgent...
","My overall feeling at the end of my viewing experience was that this was a good movie. It is not without its flaws, however.*Minor spoilers throughout this review*Why is this movie 229 minutes long? The establishing shots, the action/reaction shots, the 'oh so meaningful' facial close ups. We have a scene where a kid buys a cake to give to someone else, but then decides to eat it himself. That's great in itself, but do we really need to spend two minutes of screen time watching him eat it?The actors pull off some splendid work, but I can't see why the direction is so lauded. There is just SO much screen time used ineffectively. It almost seems that Leone felt a gangster film couldn't be taken seriously if it was less than three hours long, and he didn't want to leave anything to chance.The score is nice in parts, but gets repetitive. And don't even start on those ******g pan pipes!Throw in some gratuitous violent sex and things could start to get offensive. Watch it if you have time - you might like it.",Null,16,30,3 August 2003
Up," Beautiful, but it peaked too soon...
","There's no question in my mind that this was a sublimely wonderful film, and I hate to criticise it, but I had just one niggle - it peaked too soon! Whilst I've long respected the Pixar animators for their technical skills, it's their storytelling that I truly admire. Here, they excelled themselves. Within the first fifteen minutes of the film lies a contextualising montage. With almost no dialogue, and very little screen time, it told a story that ripped my heart out. All the adults in the theatre were crying. It was tragic and beautiful, and I'd place it as one of the best pieces of storytelling that I've ever seen on the screen, large or small.The rest of the film was likable, with charming characters and a lovely whimsical plot, but no matter how hard it tried it couldn't take me to the places, emotionally, that that first quarter hour did. And I can't believe I'm saying this about a kid's animated movie! Wonderful work, bravo Pixar!",9,1,3,23 October 2009
Some Like It Hot," Recommended, but with caveats...
","This is a highly enjoyable film if taken for what it is...a late fifties madcap comedy.It's a good comedy, maybe even a great comedy, but if you watch it expecting to be bowled over by the finest comedy film ever made then you will be very, very disappointed. It's Lemmon's film by a country mile, with a wonderful performance. Curtis hams it up wonderfully as well, though you'll find his 'legendary' Cary Grant impersonation either hilarious or irritatingly awful (I hated it!).Monroe is completely forgettable throughout, and I'm sure for that comment alone people will entirely disregard this review.This film IS funny, but it would really pain me to think that two men in dresses is still the funniest thing that a century of cinema has to offer the world.",Null,0,1,22 April 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Something of a paradox for me...
","This is probably the most high octane, action packed film that has been made in the last five years...hell, maybe ever!Why then, oh why, did I find it so insufferably boring? The action scenes are technically interesting, but way, way too long. The notorious Agent Smith fight descends into a farce as quickly as it descends into sub-'Jurassic Park' quality CGI.As the fight scenes came on thicker and faster I just wanted to whizz through them. It seemed that the scene near the end of the film where Neo meets a critical new character was the only genuine item of interest on offer. This film could have been fifteen minutes long.
The car chase scene was visually impressive but not emotionally engaging. I suppose that pretty much sums up my whole viewing experience. I'm just so glad that I didn't pay to see it.I wouldn't say 'avoid at all costs', but if you watch it don't expect much and have the remote control handy.",Null,0,0,12 October 2003
To Kill a Mockingbird," The best adaptation of a novel I have ever seen.
","What a wonderful adaptation of the novel. I had never seen this film, but when it came up on UK DVD release this week I decided to go for it. I'm so glad I did!Wonderfully atmospheric, superb acting and a wonderful score.
Note to UK readers...don't be put off by the badly colourised pictures on the case and the fact that the back of the DVD says its in colour...it isn't!",Null,5,8,10 February 2001
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," The first film I've walked out of in 37 years...
","I've given this a four as it has a lot to be commended, including some nice cast members, some great eye candy and some beautifully designed and rendered CG. I've seen a lot of criticism for Rosie Huntington-Whitely which I found a bit unfair. She is, to borrow the vernacular, 'smoking hot', but she also gave a credible performance. Sure, she won't be troubling the Academy next year, but this is a Blockbuster action flick, not Richard III.But my problem with this film is that it's SO DULL! Non stop action isn't exciting for long - it gets tedious quickly. When this film reached it's natural set piece finale and it still had an hour to run I just got up and walked out, and that was the first time in my life I've ever done that.I'm sure this movie could be saved with some ruthless editing. It could lose an hour. A whole hour. Comfortably.",4,2,6,10 July 2011
