Hereditary," What's the fuss about
",Didnt find it creepy or horror worthy. Felt like watched different movie,5,1,3,16 September 2019
Spider-Man 3," Overall A Pretty GOOD movie
",I happen to watch this movie twice on Friday. First time in the early morning show and second time the late night show. Believe me after reading all those reviews I feel like to write my one too. And this one wants to display the strength of the movie. Every human being be it normal human or superhero has to face certain things in his life. And this movies showcases some of them if not all. :) I like the part where Peter speaks about the Choices one can have in life. Fight scenes are brilliantly depicted and shot. The love tension between the lead pair is perfectly handled. The scene of bridge was little exaggerated. I like the movie and it is worth a watch with all those CGIs and emotions packed in it. Enjoy... Have Fun... :) Words of Advice: Don't strain your brain too much,9,1,2,6 May 2007
