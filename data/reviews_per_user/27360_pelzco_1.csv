10 Cloverfield Lane," don't read too much about this movie before you see it.
","the less you know about the film the more you enjoy! the less clue the better. the under-informed the more entertained. that's it! i would have stopped, but they want me to write 10 lines. 10 lines in English for an Austrian ... what a task (Austria, not Australia! we speak German, usually) so to fill your lines i could write down some spoilers in the meanwhile. but i won't. no fun. just 1 more thing to say: john Goodman flabbergasts me nearly every time i see him on screen. same here, in 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE. how he transformed from roseanne's husband ... blablablah. you really wanna hear more of my blah? see. OK, so enjoy the movie, folks!",7,2,4,29 March 2016
