The Blair Witch Project," True Psychological Horror!
","You know why the blair witch project is scary it feels real! The blair witch isn't full of jumpscares,blood ect it feeds on your fear of the unknown its a Psychological horror from start to finish that keeps you on the edge of your seat.There are some complaints about the movie like 'where's the witch' so some people complain about that but the fact you don't see the witch makes it scarier not knowing is true fear! Withholding information from the characters and
audience puts them on the same page.Other people say nothing happens but are you crazy no one gets a break in that movie something is always holding the 3 film makers from progressing if its supernatural or just nature is up to you to decide.in conclusion his is a good movie (better than most other found footage movies) that just works! it has a has a rich deep lore a great production history authentic feel and great acting!",8,1,4,24 August 2019
