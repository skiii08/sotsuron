The Monuments Men," Why you don't get it.
","Reading the reviews here its obvious that most Americans don't get this one. Which is sad since its a movie about good Americans doing good things. I think the problem is that you are so used to the 'comedy - or -thriller - or action?' formula that you feel lost without it.If you spend the whole movie trying to decide what kind of movie it is (or worse: feeling its to little comedy, thriller or action in it) you will miss the whole movie - and the point.But the subject of this movie is a bit to serious to make a comedy, and a bit to uplifting to make a thriller. Its about people trying to make good in a war, or better; people trying to reverse some of the bad that war brings. Its not your standard American film going from plotpoint to plotpoint but more of an European film going from scene to scene, and the actors are great.",9,1,2,16 July 2014
