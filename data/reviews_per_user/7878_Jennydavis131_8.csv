Casablanca," a great classic film
","Love, passion, corruption, lies and murder are only a few things that are contained in Casablanca's story line. Made in 1942 it remains a great film that people still talk about today. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is a man bitter about love, and doesn't stick his neck out for no one. He lives in the city of Casablanca in Morocco and owns his own American caf√© which is more like a saloon than a good place to sip coffee. A long love Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) revisits Rick unexpectedly and leads to a lengthy flash back to better days in France.As the Germans are trying to take over the world during WWII people flee to Casablanca to try and get to America for a free and safe life. The plot speeds up as a customer of Rick's asks him to hold on to papers that will lead anyone out of Casablanca and into America with no questions asked. When the man gets killed by the corrupt police, Rick is stuck with something he doesn't want and does not know what to do with it.Casablanca is one of the most emotional movies the viewer will ever see, from love and lust to murder and deception you're always on the edge for your seat and wanting to know more.The actors could not have done better. Humphrey Bogart's detached emotion adds a lot of comedy to the film, but when he loosens up sentimentally you can't help but to cheer. Ingrid Bergman is a great actress who can love you one second then pretend to hate you the next. Claude Rains who plays Capt. Louis Renault is a man who gets what he wants when he wants it even if it costs other peoples lives, but some his cold heart unthaws.The dialog in the film is lengthy and somewhat confusing at points, but normal for those classic films that try to be sophisticated.
Casablanca is a film to watch over and over again without it getting old or boring, and can still connect to its audience 60 years later. So here's looking at you kid.",9,1,2,28 April 2004
Citizen Kane," A really good movie!
","When Charles Foster Kane was a boy, his mother sent him away from his home in Colorado to live with a banker in New York. His mother was the owner of the Colorado gold mine and wanted her son to grow up somewhere nice. As a young man, Charles was kicked out of almost every prestigious college, including Harvard. When Charles turned twenty one, his mother had orders that he would take full ownership of his mother's fortune. When he got full ownership of his wealth, he bought the New York Inquirer newspaper. He turned it into the most unique paper of its time and he began taking over many other papers in other states until he had the most circulation.
Many people think that this is the story of William Randolph Hurst who ran the New York journal at the same time when the movie was in production. There are many similarities between William Randolph Hurst and Charles Foster Kane, but the truth is this is a fictional story of a fictional character.This particular movie is the most intriguing film that I have seen. The script was written for radio broadcast and soon became a motion picture and some of the dialog stayed the same. The way that the film starts out is unique because the main character dies then summarizes his life. The main plot is to figure out what the meaning of Charles Foster Kane's last word `rosebud', meant. What was also intriguing was the lighting, in some scenes there would be very bright light, and other scenes so dark you could barely see the characters face. The acting was surprisingly good because all the co-stars had never acted before in their lives.The film was delightfully funny, sad, and dramatic. You could almost feel the characters emotions. Orson Welles was a genius when he put together this film that he stared in and also directed. It will probably be one of the greatest films that I will see in my life-time, and was one of the greatest films of its time.",9,5,8,14 November 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," the strangest movie i have ever seen
","Dr. Strangelove is probably the strangest film the reviewer has ever seen but yet probably the most creative. This film can be viewed as a satire about war movies or war itself, and it is a black comedy. The movie is directed by Stanley Kubrick and stars Peter Sellers and George C. Scott.
 This film is about a general, ironically named Jack Ripper played by Sterling Hayden, who orders nuclear bombs to drop on Russia. When the President finds what has happened he finds out that there is no way to get a hold of Ripper and stop all the madness. Once Russia finds out what's going on, the U.S. is informed of a `doomsday machine' that would destroy the whole world. There is so much hilarity in this film it's amazing. There is one particular scene that stands out from all the rest and that is when a pilot of one of the planes, goes through a check of his crews survival kits. The pilot goes over the intercom and reads off the items. They include 9 packs of chewing gum, a miniature bible, and various medications such as vitamins, sleeping pills, pep pills, and tranquilizers. It also includes prophylactics, and womens nylons. At the end of the checklist the pilot says to himself `Shoot! A fella could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with all this stuff.
The acting was just great, all the characters where unbelievably well thought out. The reviewer's favorite character was General Buck Turgidson played by George C. Scott. His character is outrageous and in your face. He also has an obsession with chewing gum. There could not be a better cast for this film. The set, costume and props were all great. They looked so realistic and not so 1964. There are many scenes in the film where a plane is flying around scenery, it does not look as fake as it could have been, it was impressive for a 1960's film. The music adds a lot of comedy to the movie as well. During a scene that is supposed to be serious they always seem to have music for enlightenment.This movie is the funniest war movie ever. The reviewer highly recommends it to people that love and hate war movies and love comedy as well. The reviewer would rate this film 9/10.",9,1,2,15 March 2004
Some Like It Hot," great fun
","Set in 1929, prohibition and alcohol is definitely one of many undertones to this film. Two men, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are musicians with very bad luck and who can't seem to make ends meet. In the middle of winter in New York City the two men witness a mob whacking and now have criminals chasing after them. Their luck seems to change when they pose as women to play in an all girl band headed for Florida. As they meet their train for the job, they are dressed as women, and you can't help to think `those are two ugly chicks'. This film being made in the 1950's, is about cross dressers and a little hint of homosexuality, with Marilyn Monroe seducing her audience with her good looks, its hard to believe that people would stomach this film as a family movie while Leave it to Beaver is playing on the television at home.
Some like it hot ironically portrays Monroe's real life where alcohol is her first and only resort, and her trouble with men and love. Her role is the stupid blonde that can't really think or do for herself, and that women are just gold diggers. Even though her role is stereotypical she is a very convincing actress.Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are great actors and a great pair for this film. Totally hilarious is an understatement as two men posed as women are fighting for affection of the same girl. The scene where they break their feminine characters are great.The music is great from hot Jazz to smooth classical, the right music is in the right scene at just the right time, which adds to the emotion of the characters.There is also some great action scenes in some like it hot. The most impressive is in the beginning as the cops are chasing a car full of mobsters, gunfire and car crashes fill the screen. Even though it's a 50's film it was just as effective as today.Some like it hot is a great family film, in which you will have fun just watching it. This film is highly recommended and a great piece to add to your home video library.",9,4,7,27 April 2004
Psycho," a chilling thriller
","Psycho was the movie that put Alfred Hitchcock on the map and leads to his great career. Psycho is an all time thriller and suspense movie for all people. Ten minutes into the film you're on the edge of your seat asking yourself what's going to happen next. Hitchcock was great with developing his characters and the plot. As you sit and watch the film you are amazed by the genius of Hitchcock on the way that he not only shoots the film but also the lighting and music. The lighting helps make everything seem eerie, and the  music puts chills down your spin. The plot twists will keep your head spinning and is mind blowing. Through all this suspense you may even find some humor. As you meet the characters one by one you hope that you will never be in their situation. The reviewer would highly recommend this film to everyone, even if you don't like scary movies. The reviewer would rate this film 10/10.",10,0,1,14 March 2004
Rear Window," slow but good
","This film is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most popular movies. The movie seems to start out slow and doesn't really pickup the pace until the concluding end. The film is about a man  L.B. `Jeff' Jeffries  played by James Stewart. Jeff has a broken leg and sits in a wheelchair, spending his time spying on his neighbors through a courtyard. When Jeff starts to suspect that one of his neighbors may have killed his wife, he asks his girlfriend Lisa, played by Grace Kelly, what he should do. At first Lisa thinks he might be going mad until she starts to get into the courtyard drama herself. As Jeff's curiosity grows toward his neighbor's abnormal behavior, the suspense starts and you're on the edge of your seat. The only great thing in this film is the acting.  Since Stewart can't move much, he uses facial expressions. Those expressions seem to say it all, it adds a lot to his characters behavior. Grace Kelly's performance is also good, as she plays the concerned girlfriend and detective at the same time.
The reviewer noticed the most peculiar thing about the music in the film. There was no actual background music placed in the movie, all the music that is heard comes from the neighbor's piano or someone's radio/record player. The reviewer has never seen this before in a movie. This is actually a good film if you can sit through the first hour and a half. The reviewer would recommend this film to people who love Hitchcock , and or old thrillers.",6,1,4,14 March 2004
The Godfather," undoubtedly the best mob movie ever!
","The Godfather is the classic mob movie. The film is totally different from all the others in its genre. The way Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo wrote this film so that the viewer actually sympathizes with the characters of the Italian mafia. Within the first scene the writers introduced all the main characters and all that's left to the film are twists, suspense, surprises and thrills.The film also has many romantic scenes. Michael Corleone (Pacino) is in Sicily and walking through the open country when he and his two bodyguards stumble upon a beautiful young woman leading a school of children. Their eyes meet and it's love at first sight.  Michael being brought up with the utmost respect went to the girls father and asked to meet her in the presence of their family. The viewer can't help but think `How sweet.' Fortunately the father approves and love blossoms into marriage.The acting in the film is like no other and with so many big stars the viewer can't help but be excited to see so many great names in one film. Marlon Brando plays the role of the Godfather AKA Don Corleone, the leader of one out of five Italian mafias in the New York area. The way Brando developed his character was amazing and his famous voice in the film that has been mimicked for 30 years now sounds untouchable in it's originality. Al Pacino plays Brando's son Michael Corleone, who actually wasn't wanted for the part at the time but the studio cast him with the recommendation from the Director (Francis Coppola). Pacino actually sets the bar for himself when he took this role, and for all the future roles he would play in Mafia movies. His acting is compelling, and his looks are almost unrecognizable.There are actually no innocent by-standers that get hurt or victimized in the film that you might see in other mafia movies. Infact everyone that ends up dead were people that were a part of one of the mafia families. The whole film is about respect and the closeness of family if you can see behind all the violence.The film is quite long to sit through in one sitting but is totally worth it by the end. The film will grab you in an instant with curiosity to the underground world of the mob.This is undoubtedly the best mob movie ever. This film is recommended for people that love mafia films. And for the people who don't really care for these types of movies this film will change your mind on organized crime movies.",9,0,2,4 May 2004
