The Incredible Hulk," Worst Marvel movie I've ever seen
","Wow. Just wow. I never thought I could fall asleep during an MCU movie, but now I have. What was Marvel thinking, casting Edward Norton as Bruce? He was terrible. I'm glad Mark Ruffalo plays him now. All in all, stay away from this film.",5,2,3,30 June 2018
