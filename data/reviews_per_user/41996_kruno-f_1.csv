Blade Runner 2049," Probably the worst reboot to this day!
","This is a very, very bad movie. It is insultingly dim and makes me want to fight for the cause of some sort of 'money-return' policy for cinemas. I simply don't think cinemas should have a blank check for taking people's money for such atrocities. The only way I'd keep any respect for Mr. Villeneuve is if he asked for this movie to be ascribed to Adam Smith. It doesn't get much dumber than this. I would have no problems saying that Phantom Menace does more justice to Star Wars than this movie does to the original Blade Runner. It is as if screenwriter never read anything in his life. I'm happy to see Tyler Perry makes more money than this shame. Mr. Villeneuve, you should be ashamed of yourself. You took the lead from all the Lucas', Spielbergs, Scotts of the world.",1,6,14,26 October 2017
