The Blair Witch Project," War of the movie fans...
","I love and admire every single frame of The Blair Witch Project, and nothing anyone says will ever be able to shake me from that opinion.  BWP is, for me at least, one of the scariest movies of all time.  You have to pay attention, you have to think, you have to imagine.  The movie doesn't show us the witch for the same reason 2001 doesn't show us aliens and the original Jaws barely ever shows us the shark--your imagination is much more effective at creating those images than any special effects artist could ever be.  We live in an age where every movie plot point is so thoroughly explained that even the dullest audience member can follow the action and where special effects take the place of characterization.  It's incredibly refreshing when a rare movie like this one that actually respects its audience comes along.Maybe the problem is that the film respects its audience too much.  I guess people see the words 'scary as hell' in the trailer and they go to the movie expecting to see blunt, frightening images.  But that's not the way BWP works, and those viewers just sit there waiting for some more traditional movie scare that never comes.  Or maybe they've never been out in the woods, and have no idea how incredibly creepy it can be out there at night.  Maybe they were too busy ruining the movie for everyone else, yawning and making jokes and obnoxiously asking if the movie was over yet, to be able to hear any of the dialogue.  Or maybe they just enjoy bashing successful, publicized movies because they want to feel different from everyone else.  I don't know.Too many people have the mistaken impression that a movie takes one form and that's it, that's all the movie is.  The Blair Witch Project is different. It's like a horror movie Mad Lib.  It can be as scary as you want it to be.",10,2,3,15 December 2000
Spartacus," Worthwhile but uneven and poorly paced
","For all the praise it's received, I really think Spartacus is a pretty flawed movie.  Basically the film's scenes fall into two distinctly different categories.  First, there are scenes following Spartacus as he suffers through gladiatorial school, rebels against his tormentors, falls in love, and leads a slave revolt that threatens to topple the power of the Roman empire.  These segments succeed in everything they seek to achieve-- they entertain mindlessly and viscerally, and somehow manage to be exciting and predictable at the same time.  We all know, for instance, that the mean gladiator instructor is eventually going to get what's coming to him, but we're actually surprised and a little shocked when he finally does.  Add an effective score by Alex North, some occasionally touching human drama, and a massive battle sequence that clearly served as inspiration for Braveheart's massive festivals of destruction, and you've got one hell of a movie.But then someone decided that the film needed about an hour and forty-five minutes of flat, uninteresting, irrelevant, utterly useless political intrigue among the Roman heads of state.  Spartacus is one seriously lengthy movie, and during the segments focusing on the senate and the military leaders you can't help but look at your watch a few times.  I went along with these scenes at first, but after a while I lost track of all the confusing different political figures and what they were trying to accomplish.  I sat trying to figure out who everyone was and how the intrigues affected the Spartacus revolt story and found myself dozing off. Having seen the film again, I now know who everyone is, but I still haven't figured out why all this scheming and plotting is important to the story at all.  It's just dead weight that slows the movie down right when it should be reaching escape velocity, and I really wish most of it had been left in the editing room.I can only half recommend this film.  A movie made up of just the Spartacus story along with only a few, essential scenes devoted to the Roman leaders would really have been a true classic.  But instead we have a movie that just gets in its own way for just about half of its running time.  Good thing Kubrick had more control over the rest of his films...",7,4,10,17 November 2000
Akira," Complex, unusual film
","The first time I saw Akira (on dubbed, pan & scan VHS) I was very disappointed.  I had pretty much misunderstood the entire film and sat in stunned disbelief as the end credits began to roll.  Having been familiar with various animes, such as Ghost in the Shell and Wings of Honneamise, for a long time, I just couldn't believe that THIS was the classic everyone was talking about.I now know better.  Akira is like the anime 2001; you just don't get it the first time around.  Look at the explosion we see at the beginning of the film, for instance--despite the initial reaction you'll probably have, that isn't a nuclear weapon of any kind.  It's something much, much different, and the only clues we have as to what it really is turn up towards the very end of the movie.  Because of stuff like that, Akira is a demanding, obtuse film that really requires a lot of work on the part of the viewer, and the funny thing is that it doesn't have nearly as much gore or nudity as one might expect. The story has its flaws.  Writer-director Katsuhiro Otomo was faced with the seemingly impossible task of compressing his 38-issue (I think) manga series into a two-hour film, in a way that would please both fans of the comics and Akira newcomers.  As a result I think there are too many characters and subplots swirling around.  Personally I would have liked the film much better if Otomo had left out all the confusion with the corrupt parliament and the underground resistance movement, and focused more on the complex relationship between Tetsuo and Kaneda.  The movie's greatest story strengths are the statements it makes about friendship and teenage violence, and most of the other plot elements made sense in the manga but aren't really necessary here.But in the final analysis, Akira is an intelligent and provocative film that deserves its cult classic status.  And it need hardly be said that the English dub is pure garbage compared to the Japanese version with subtitles. Watch it, and then watch it again.",10,0,1,21 November 2000
Akira," Not the movie everyone thinks it is
","I've learned to love this film, but it shocks me that such a loyal cult following has sprung up around it.  It's not an easy movie to watch-- the story meanders between many different interlocking plot threads (personally, I find the sections dealing with the underground resistance movement to be boring and needlessly complicated).  At its core, though, it's a story about a biker, Tetsuo Shima, who suffers from an inferiority complex and lives in a self-imposed cloud of low self-esteem; when Tetsuo gains psychic powers after the government experiments on his brain, he uses his new-found abilities to take revenge against a world that rejected and scorned him as a child.  'Akira' disguises itself as a big crazy science fiction movie, but it's really about the Columbine syndrome, how some misguided young people can only escape their self-imposed feelings of isolation through violence against the supposedly happier, more 'accepted' people they see and envy every day.  A fascinating film that absolutely demands multiple viewings, and one of the most rewarding movies ever made (if you understand it).",10,0,1,3 April 2000
Armageddon," Like watching the tip of a spinning propeller blade
","Armageddon is just one dilemma after another, and you can sense the desperation with which each new obstacle/problem was added to the film.  I still don't understand what causes the Russian space station to explode, other than the movie's general need to have something blow up every few minutes regardless of cause or effect.  Later in the film there is a retread of the always dependable which-wire-do-I-pull-to-defuse-this-bomb routine, which works in many movies but just doesn't make sense here.  It's not a terrorist bomb--the astronauts work for the organization that made it, NASA, who in any acceptable circumstance would have thoroughly briefed everyone about the bomb and told them exactly what wire to pull should such an emergency arise (or, even better, put a STOP DETONATION SEQUENCE button somewhere on it).  And then Steve Buscemi just starts randomly shooting stuff because apparently he didn't think they were in enough trouble yet. That's how this movie works--bad things happen for these astronauts, and it doesn't matter how or why they happen as long as they happen.  The film would have been much, much better if it had just taken a couple of these dilemmas and developed them more, but the story ended up being a constant barrage of obstacles and setbacks that just end up canceling each other out. You know these guys are always going to be in trouble but then just barely scrape through, and what should be exciting becomes an onslaught of boredom.
But it's the editing that really derails this movie.  It's impossible to tell what's going on in the action sequences because they're edited so quickly.  You see something for less than a second and, while you're still trying to figure out what you just saw, you see something else, and then something else, and after a while you just give up and let the movie take off without you.  There's no reason for it.  Braveheart and Gladiator used hyper-editing to convey the chaos and randomness of battle; this film uses it to dull us into believing we're watching something exciting or stylish or interesting, even though we're not.  Or maybe it's so we can't see how fake the special effects are, I'm not sure.  Armageddon is a brainless event movie that actually forces a high degree of effort on the part of the viewer, and that's something that should never exist.  You go to a movie like this to relieve stress, not increase it.Have fun with this movie if you can.",4,0,1,18 November 2000
North by Northwest," Great but FLAWED (some mild spoilers)
","I won't bother with any of that nonsense about how this is one of the greatest movies ever made.  Everybody knows that, and if anyone tries to tell you otherwise, let me know so I can stamp the word IDIOT on their forehead.  But the movie has a terrible, terrible flaw that needs to be addressed.Simply put, Hitchcock should have cut that early scene where the intelligence agency members discuss what they are going to do now that Thornhill has been mistaken for Kaplan.  It's an awful scene.  For one thing, the scene is incredibly poorly written in comparison with the rest of the film--the characters say everything over and over again, in the simplest terms possible, as though they think we're all too stupid to figure anything out.  More importantly, though, the scene completely ruins the mystery of George Kaplan way too early in the film.  Imagine if that scene were removed.  Then we'd be closer to Thornhill's plight throughout the entire movie--when he sees that guy at the cornfield, we'd think that was Kaplan, just like Thornhill does.  And then when the professor guy shows up at the airport, we'd all be like, 'Okay, now that HAS to be Kaplan.'  And we'd learn the truth about Kaplan right along with Thornhill.  But that dumb scene at the beginning spoils the mystery, and unfortunately that keeps us from relating with Thornhill as much as we otherwise might have.Don't let any of this stop you from seeing the movie.  It's wonderful.  But while you watch it, think about what it might have been.",10,2,3,5 March 2001
The Patriot," Disappointing
","Nearly all of the comments posted here address the issue of the historical inaccuracies that run rampant throughout The Patriot.  The film's detractors attack the loose approach Emmerich and Devlin have taken with regard to American history, while fans of the movie dismiss the inaccuracies and say that the film never tried to follow the history books.  My theory is that, if the movie had been good enough to justify taking those liberties, no one would ever even mention them.  Rarely does anyone complain about the inaccuracies of Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, Apocalypse Now, Lawrence of Arabia, or any of the other great historical period films, because those movies are effective enough to make such historical goofs irrelevant.  The Patriot, by contrast, is set right here in America, in a time period that nearly all of us have learned about in school, so the inaccuracies are bound to be noticed.  But even without going to school, any thinking viewer will easily see that no real war has ever been this cleanly divided between Good and Evil.  It's painfully obvious that the colonists weren't really that lovable and virtuous, and that the British were not as hissably evil or comically formal as they are in this film.  This isn't some fantasy like Independence Day or Godzilla, this is a movie that tries to be about a real event that took place and involved real people who fought and died for what they believed.  I think it really is a sign of a bad film when it tries to depict real historical events, and ends up being even less believable than ID4.  One more minor quibble-- the movie gives us no sense of geography.  We never know where the hell any of the screen action is taking place once things really get going; wouldn't it have been more effective to give us an idea of the real places, many of which still exist today, where this struggle took place?",4,1,3,2 November 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Great but flawed
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a great movie.  It really is.  The fight scenes are probably the best ever filmed, the special effects are completely convincing without relying on computers, the performances and production design are without flaw, and the cinematography is gorgeous.But in all honesty I must report a couple of minor quibbles.  First of all, the story is a bit too complex and sometimes the subtitles are too fast to be easily understood.  Obviously those problems would be irrelevant after seeing the film more than once, and the film is certainly compelling enough to warrant repeated viewings, so I don't really consider those complaints very important.  But even if you completely understood everything, though, the movie would still be flawed.  About an hour in, the story is suddenly interrupted by a very long flashback sequence involving the warrior princess and a bandit she encounters in the desert.  The sequence is much too long, not very interesting, and very oddly placed, completely stifling the film's momentum for about 25 minutes.  Information conveyed in the flashback is definitely vital to the story, but I would have admired the movie much more if that segment had been shorter and more smoothly integrated into the flow of the film.Really, though, who cares?  The movie is excellent and has one of the most oddly powerful endings I've ever seen.  Go see it.",8,0,0,25 December 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Something of a departure
","Having only recently (within the last year or so) become a rabid admirer of Kubrick's work, I was frothing at the prospect of actually seeing one of his films on the big screen.  And even the rush I felt as I watched the big yellow words 'Star Wars' zoom away on The Phantom Menace's opening night pales in comparison to what I was going through in the minutes before this, Kubrick's final release, unspooled before me.  Roughly an hour later, though, I had pretty much forgotten about the great director and settled into the depths of William Harford's mind and conflicts.  While it lasts, this movie completely immerses its audience.  But somehow, Eyes Wide Shut isn't like Kubrick at all; while his stories usually only use characters to prove a point or make some statement about society, this film attempts to achieve psychological realism in its portrayal of a doctor's sexual escapades and their effects on his marriage.  It's as though the whole movie is just one giant experiment, like Kubrick wanted to see if he could really create a believable human character.  There's still meaning and messages and all that good stuff, but they seem tacked on to the complicated plot and occasionally shocking sexual imagery (which was shamelessly softened to avoid an NC-17 after Kubrick's death by the use of Austin Powers-esque 'covering' techniques-- let's pray to God they give us the original version on video).  It's a decent movie in and of itself, but a far cry from 2001 or A Clockwork Orange.",7,0,0,19 July 1999
Scream," Good, in and of itself
","A lot of people hate this movie, mostly because it inspired the glut of awful postmodern horror flicks we've endured over the last few years.  The complaint is valid (don't get me started about Urban Legends: Final Cut), but don't let that stop you from watching and appreciating this movie for what it is.  Scream really is a good film.  Sure, some of the characters are a bit annoying and some scenes just kind of slow things down, but as a whole the movie is exciting, well-written, and occasionally truly frightening.  The Drew Barrymore sequence, as overly familiar as it has become, is horror filmmaking of a high order--Craven proves that even the same old cliches can be frightening if they are used with the right timing and balance.  It's nearly impossible to make a good slasher film, since the genre has been so overdone; Scream pulls it off, and does it with a smile on its face.Sure the sequels and imitators and spoofs are awful.  Sure Craven and his colleagues fell back into the same old rut that this movie protested.  But Scream exists on a higher level than the rest of the pack.",9,0,0,15 March 2001
Princess Mononoke," My favorite film
","I really can't think of anything to say about this movie.  It's almost too good.  I can never watch it without wishing we had someone like Miyazaki-sama here in the States, or that we had more of his films on DVD, or that this movie had gotten the mainstream theatrical distribution it deserved.  If Disney had been smart enough to release this film subtitled, with a real advertising campaign, it could have been more successful than Crouching Tiger.  There's a reason why this is the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time, and if its distributors had handled it better it could have won Best Foreign Film.  Hell, it should have won Best Picture for 1997, and Jo Hisaishi ABSOLUTELY deserved the Best Original Score award. 
But none of that happened.  And that's why it's so hard to watch.  Because Mononoke Hime is the best film of all time, and most Americans will never bother to see it.",10,0,1,14 March 2001
