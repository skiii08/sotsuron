Iron Man 3," A lot better than what other reviews here say...
","I don't normally write reviews, but after reading a lot of negative reviews on this movie I thought it deserves a more honest review from someone who watched it with an open mind. First of all, if you're a comics fanboy and you want the movie to closely adhere to the comics and not do anything contrary to that, then yes you won't like it. For those who have a more open mind and can simply watch a movie without expectations or preconceived judgments, then this movie is actually quite good. In terms of story, I'd actually say it was better than the first Ironman movie. The pacing is better, and the story is a lot deeper. Of course it doesn't quite have the WOW impact of the first movie simply because the first movie had that 'first time wow factor' involved. Here, the suits are pretty much what you've seen before. But the action is better than almost any Marvel movie to date. Only the Avengers comes close to the action.There are a lot of funny moments, but the overall tone of the movie is a lot more serious than the first 2 Ironmans. So give this movie a shot. Watch it with an open mind, and you'll be extremely pleased.",8,3,10,8 May 2013
