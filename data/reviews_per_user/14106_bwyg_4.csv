Blade Runner 2049," in a word, spectacular
","My wife and I streamed the 2007 'final cut' version of Blade Runner last weekend and went to see BR 2047 today; it's just spectacular. The attention to detail is amazing. Roger Deakins hits another home run with lighting that's perfectly natural. His framing is, well, it's Deakins; it doesn't get much better. And the sets... dang. Those people should be picking up some serious awards for this film. The music is awesome, the use of Tibetan horns is perfect. And the rest of the sound was amazing. Anyone who's interested in sound should make a trek to the theater for this movie.Contrary to many, I thought the pacing was perfect. As was the length. I can't think of anything I'd be willing to cut, or anything I'd be willing to shorten.I loved the original Blade Runner; this sequel actually builds on and exceeds the original. I wound not have thought that possible.After Arrival and now BR 2047, Denis Villeneuve is my new favorite director.",10,11,24,10 October 2017
Moana," yet another in a long line of Disney princess movies
","I was... underwhelmed. Moana follows the standard Disney princess theme with less variation than I hoped. Disney is expert at manipulating your emotions. But Pixar is excellent at providing a story to go with it. This time, Disney won and Pixar lost. Not a lot of there there.What's odd is that Zootopia is just an amazing film. Zootopia crushes Moana on every level. Even the music. But then, Zootopia has a story to tell. All the difference in the world, that is.As an aside, Disney apparently put in a lot of work to find an ethnically authentic princess in Auli'i Cravalho. Yet, if I read the credits correctly, she shared credit with another lass for the songs. I'm not sure what that means in the world of animation, but it does leave one scratching one's head wondering what one just heard.Disney, go back and look at Zootopia again. More like that please!",5,18,47,1 December 2016
Interstellar," Not much more than a summer pop corn movie
","I'm disappointed. Nolan failed to break out of his mold and make a truly challenging movie. This is one heck of a summer pop corn movie, I'll give it that. But it's not much more than that, and it has perhaps the worst sound design I've heard in 20 years. Nolan himself says in interviews that this is what he wanted -- really loud with dialog that's hard to hear. To make it 'more immersive' apparently. But if I want immersive, I can go ride my pick of rides at an amusement park. What I want when I go to the theater is for the director to tell a story. And his crappy sound design gets in the way of his telling of his story. And the story is yet another variation on his favorite theme of recursion. Meh. Getting old Chris. Old. And by the end of the movie, so were the endless references to 2001. Sheesh.A good amusement park ride, yes it is. But it's still considerably below the bar set by Gravity last year.",5,10,18,25 November 2014
Cloud Atlas," a new addition to my personal top 10 list
","It's been easily more than a decade since a new (or old) film edged its way into my personal top 10. Cloud Atlas did just that though.If there's any justice, Cloud Atlas wins Oscars for at least screenplay and editing. At least. I'm a film editor by trade; I like to think I've got a clue or two about editing. Cloud Atlas is a film editing masterwork. And I don't say that lightly.This film is unique. To my knowledge, this type of storytelling hasn't been attempted in film before. The closest is perhaps Christopher Nolan's 2000 film Momento, but Cloud Atlas makes the non-continuity technique work seamlessly. It's just beautiful.This is a film by adults, for adults. It's no summer blockbuster aimed at 14 yo boys. It's far more, and far greater. Sit back, open your mind, and let the film come to you. Contrary to many of the reviews, this film isn't too long, and it's not at all difficult to understand. If you'll have some patience and give it your attention, it's not even difficult to follow.Best film of the year. Best film of the decade. Hats off to the Wachowskis and Tykwer. Well done. Well done indeed.",10,42,81,10 November 2012
