Sucker Punch," Glass Half Full
","Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch has amazing visuals, and music that drives the scenes really hard. However where the movie falls short is the story. The story appears to be a well thought out script with fantasy worlds, and alternate realities, but it never really gathers any sympathy towards the characters. It was cool to see an action film filled with girls doing awesome moves and taking out the bad guys. But after the first action scene the fighting got kind of stale and repetitive, 'OK another slow motion back flip and shooting the gun while upside down.' Perhaps it is with the success of 300, and Watchmen that has set the bar so high for Snyder's films, or the comparing of which makes Sucker Punch fall short. This is by no means a bad movie, just not as good as one might expect from the likes of Zack Snyder.",5,1,4,2 April 2011
Insidious," Surprisingly Good and Intense
","The film Insidious has done something many horror movies have failed to do recently, and that is to be scary. Insidious has a lot of really intense moments that scare, and then grab hold of you. Its not entirely made up of 'make you jump' scenes, which it does have, but scenes with genuine horror. Insidious has taken a risk with doing something original, and It works here for them. Without giving anything away the movie does not just talk about whats scary, or show the the aftermath of something going on in a room that you can only hear until its over and the door magically unlocks. Insidious shows you whats scary, and quite often reminds you whats there, and waiting in the dark.",7,113,158,2 April 2011
