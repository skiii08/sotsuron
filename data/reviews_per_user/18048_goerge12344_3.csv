Hereditary," Was tough to watch
","As a parent, and someone who has experienced grief from losing loved ones, this was a hard film to watch. I expected it to be the typical evil little girl type of scary movie, but it was unlike any scary movie I've seen.The drama is so heavy, so well done. The acting was too good to not feel for the characters, and this made what happens to them literally painful for me. Add to that some very disturbing, graphic scenes, and it just leaves you sad and disturbed at the end.I came away from this movie feeling very heavy hearted, without any happiness left in me. It was very well done. I almost regreted watching.",Null,6,11,4 July 2018
The Wolf of Wall Street," Not funny enough, and not serious enough. A mess.
","I'm a fan of crude--I've got no problems with nudity, sex, drug use, foul language, etc. But this movie tried to be two things and failed at both. It's listed and well reviewed as a comedy, but it's not very funny. It tries too hard because it's simply not witty, almost throughout. The writer, Terrence Winter's funniest contributions to culture were Sister, Sister and Xena: Warrior Princess (4 episodes combined). That's fail #1.The attempt at being a cautionary tale is fail #2. Most people walked away amused, maybe disgusted. But who walked away with any genuine anger or sadness after this movie? Maybe a handful of people. The duped investors, and society at large are the victims of the crimes shown on screen, but you never see them, never feel their pain. There isn't even a character to develop on screen in that respect.I would've rather they'd gone all out with glorifying the crimes on screen, with actual funny dialogue and creative scenarios--that would've require another writer for sure. I would've been thrilled by that. But this movie wasn't funny, and it wasn't cautionary either. It was just a hyped up mess of a movie.This was a painted up trollop version of Boiler Room. Go watch that instead.",Null,9,21,2 January 2014
Alien: Covenant," A MUST-SEE movie if you care about the Alien story
","I was hesitant to go to the movies for this, given some of the harsh criticism, but I'm very glad I went anyway. I don't know what these people were expecting given that this movie picks up right where the last one left off, and fills in several gaps in the story from Prometheus, and tells the origin story of the alien species from the 1st movie. A lot of complaints talk about it being an unoriginal cash grab, but that is nonsense. Love went into this movie, and it shows.First off, James Franco was unable to ruin the movie, so anyone worried about that can rest easy. Danny McBride played a dramatic role, and was not jokey at all--great job. Every actor performed well, particularly the 'man of faith', in my view.This was much better than Prometheus in just about every way: casting, dialogue, action, plot, direction. Cinematography was as good as before. Covenant really showcases the brutality of the alien species, and completely exposes the underlying reason for their brutality. I consider this a must-see movie if you care at all about the Alien story.",Null,6,15,25 May 2017
