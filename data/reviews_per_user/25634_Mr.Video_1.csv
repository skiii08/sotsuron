The Blair Witch Project," Scary? I think not.
","To say that this movie was a disappointment is an understatement. This boring, silly film didn't even meet our low expectations. So much for listening to hype and media movie critics. We've heard scarier stories at slumber parties and boy scout camp fires when we were 10 years old, and those stories were scary without a constant barrage of foul language. It seemed as though the film makers thought the audience needed to hear a certain four-letter word at least 100 times to be convinced that the characters were scared.  Sorry, but the limited vocabulary really reflects a lack of creativity and makes young people look like idiots. Read 'Hansel and Gretel'; it's more frightening than this waste of time and money.",Null,0,0,6 August 1999
