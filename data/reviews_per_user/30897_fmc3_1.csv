The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Possibly the BEST movie for fans. NOT so great for non-fans.
","Non-fans will find this movie slow, and even boring. However, for the fans of the series, this is definitely one of the best. It fulfills all of their most important wishes, and does so with style and great beauty.Fans will walk out feeling warm and happy. Non-fans will wonder why nothing is happening, and why it is important. So everyone should expect that there will be a very great dichotomy of opinion about this movie, depending on which group is evaluating it.I'm a guy, who read the books and enjoyed them, despite their obvious (though unimportant) flaws, but I wouldn't be at such an early showing if it weren't for my wife. Yet, because of my understanding of the books, I can see the beauty of how this was done.If you liked the books, or like the movies, then go see this. You will enjoy it and find that it moves you. But don't be surprised that many many people won't 'get it' because EVERY bit of the 'real' (non-emotional) action is being saved for the final movie in the series.",9,5,19,18 November 2011
