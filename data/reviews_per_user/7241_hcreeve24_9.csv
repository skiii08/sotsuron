Requiem for a Dream," Gut Wrenching
","If you want to see a happy vision of heroine addiction watch something else, hell even the glum trainspotting pails in comparison to this movie.  Requiem for a Dream is about hope going away for four people due to drug addiction. The amazing thing about this film is that it shows the charecters highs as well as their lows.  You see the Euphoria and then you see the horror.  The performances are top rate especially Ellen Burstyn as the doomed Sarah GoldFarve.  Burstyn is fantastic and should have won the Oscar. I have not seen a more sad or haunting performance in years.  Jared Leto is terrific as Burstyn's never do well Heroine addict son Harry.  He gives the charecter a nuisance and a guiniune desire to do good though his life has gone bad. Marlon Wayans is shockingly good as Tai, he shocks us with the depth of what is an unheralded and overlooked performance. Jennifer Connolly is great too, she is the one that is placed in the most degrading and embarrassing situations of the four junkies and her performance is a revelation.  Requiem for a Dream is a spectacular nightmare of addiction, it is a horror show and it is a great one. This is the best movie I have seen in the last 5 years, this one is a mind blower.  The hardiest men will be tears by the end of this one. At the end of this movie your stomach will be in knots your heart will be broken, and you will want to watch this movie over again cause it affected you so deeply. Ladies and Gentlemen run don't walk to the video store for this overlooked gem. I give it a 10/10",10,0,1,4 September 2002
Se7en," A classic Chiller
","I remember when me and my friend were going to see Showgirls one day, and at the last minute we decided to see this movie instead.  All I can say is we definately made the right choice, this movie is nothing short of stunning. David Fincher and Brad and Morgan have weaved a tapestry out of suspense and surprise.  This movie was David Fincher's Pennance for Alien 3, this movie had everything that one did not, it had a brilliant script, and a numbing ending. For those of you who haven't seen this movie yet, be prepared to be knocked off your seat by the ending.  Be prepared to see evil in the killer John Doe, be prepared to look into Morgan Freemans haunted eyes for 2 hours, most of all be prepared to be dazzled. This is the best serial killer movie besides Silence of the Lambs.  This one like Lambs will be remembered as a classic.",10,0,0,4 February 2001
Fight Club," I am Jack's stunned mind
","Fight Club is unlike anything you have ever seen. It is at a dark comedy, a social commentary, a twisted love story, and finally a total assualt to your senses.  Edward Norton plays the narrator, a biting commentary on the facelessness of our society. He is suffering from insomia when he starts to go to self help groups.  The groups help him sleep.  Helena Boheim Carter plays Marla a fellow support group faker whom the narrator despises. When we meet Tyler Durden we know he's trouble.  Tyler comments on how the proper mixture of OJ and gasoline will make Napalm.  Durden is brilliantly played by Brad Pitt, he plays Durden as a sadistic anarchist, who believes society should de-evolve from its friendly nature. Tyler and the narrator form Fight Club, a club that the basic goal is to beat the crap out of one and another.  It is a brutal club based on a idea of infinite freedom.  The club slowly evolves into a sick little militia called Project Mayhem. The rest of them movie is a sick little game between Tyler and the Narrator.  The end result being the stunning truth about their relationship. Fight Club is ingenious and it isn't for everyone. The movie is bizzare and shocking it is twisted and brilliant.  The movie is one stunning twist after another and it is a testament to Finchers genius.  This is a fantastic movie and I would recomend it to everyone.",10,0,1,7 March 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," What the hell were they thinking
","I just got out of the Matrix Revolutions a couple of hours ago and I think I am beginning to dislike the film more by the minute.  There are a lot of problems with this film, but to me the primary trouble with it is simple there isn't any closure, they didn't answer any of the questions they asked, and the action sequences were underwhelming.  First off let's start with the action sequences, simply put they blew their creative wad on the first two films.  The Zion shootout was allright but felt too artificial, nothing like the rescue scene from the first one and the brilliant highway chase scene from the second one, and the final battle between Neo and Smith was allright but hey we have scene Neo take on a hundred agent Smiths in Reloaded how much fun is it going to be to see him just fight one.  The movie doesn't answer any of it's questions either, it is like someone asking you a question and then skimping on the answer.  They left so much for us to ponder with the first two and they basically copped out on the answers.  I suspect this film was heavily edited and we may see a three hour DVD one of these days.  Anyways the film is a mess and I am sooooooooo disapointed. I loved the first one and thought Reloaded was even better, this one was just a letdown.",6,0,0,7 November 2003
Armageddon," A cinematic Libotomy
","Brain hurts...movie too bad to comprehend. Brain bursting like one the poor bozo's from scanners. God Mike Bay sucks! Can Hollywood please stop hiring this shallow no talent hack. His movies trying to inject some sentimentality is like a person with tourettes syndrome trying to write a greeting card. Sure it tries to tug your heartstrings but ultimately it cannot achieve such depth no matter how hard it tries. This movie is what Top Gun would have been like if a chimp directed it. Here's hoping Transformers flops (fat change) and The Prince of Persia rolls over and dies at the B.O., so we can finally rid ourselves of Michael Bay.",1,1,4,25 June 2007
Transformers," A pretty decent flick but Bay still sucks
","I found Transformers a mixed bag, sure I loved the special effects, I thought the actors handled their cotton candy roles well, the pacing was decent in places, but the 'director' good old Michael Bay #$@#ed another movie up. From the start there is a lot to like about the Transformers, Shia Lebouff is very good as Sam the movies protagonist, the aforementioned special effects are dazzling, and the movie moved at a brisk clip, but it is the fight scenes that sink this movie. The reason I hate Michael Bay is his reliance on quick cuts. I love to absorb an action scene, to see the chaos of the situation like pure ballet, if I directed this movie you would see fists flying, gears popping, and slow explosions galore. With Bay you get a flash in the pan, a scene shot with so much disorientation that it is hard to tell what the f$#$ is going on. SPOILERS There is one scene in particular with Optimus Prime fighting the police car Transformer and we barely see the fight, in fact Bay cuts out most of the fight. We see the aftermath of the fight sure, but we don't get to see the fight itself, and isn't that the reason we all put our money down in the first place. SPOILERS END In summary it is a shame this movie doesn't flop outright, and the Prince of Persia doesn't follow it into shame, while this movie hardly deserves to flop its demise might rid us of Michael Bay once and for all. Believe it or not folks that would be a worthwhile sacrifce.",7,0,3,7 July 2007
Mission: Impossible II," How about plot imcomprehensible, or plot contrivable
","What a waste of money, of talent of time, I saw this movie and I tell what I am disowning John Woo. Nah I can forgive him and Cruise. But the movie is a mess it is some nonsesence about a virus that could wipe out the world or some garbage like that. I was too busy trying to keep my eyes open to pay all that much attention in the first place. Dougray Scott plays the villain whateverhisnameis, just a lame excuse for him to flaunt an Austraillian accent and act like a scumbag. All in all this movie is a complete waste of time and a total bore unless you count the last 20 minutes which were truly exciting.  With Cruise and Woo involved you hoped for more but the only thing about this movie that is impossible is watching it.",5,0,0,29 September 2000
The Silence of the Lambs," That expires in one week you aren't real FBI are you?
","This is a classic, this is one of the films that should be played in Film 101 class.  This is one of the most unnerving movies ever made it is a classic in every sense of the word, and it leaves a lasting impression on everyone who sees it.  This is the movie that you can't miss it is one of the best one of the 90's, and all time.  From the chilling line qouted above, to the rest of the mayhem this is a chiller.  Hopskins is excellent in one of the best displays of acting talent ever. You look in Hopskins eyes and you can see pure evil, and his taunts are bone chilling.  Hopkins is pure evil, and Hannibal Lecter is a classic villan.  Jodie Foster is great as Clarice Starling the haunted FBI agent interviewing Lecter to find a killer named Buffallo Bill.  Foster is purity taken back by the literate and charming tongue of Hospkins.  This movie is pure genius and if you haven't see it run to your nearest video store now.  For a 5 time Oscar winner that deserved every single award it won.  I can't wait to see Hannibal.",10,1,1,2 February 2001
Live Free or Die Hard," John McClane Saves the summer!
","Let's be honest, so far this summer movie season has sucked eggs. Though I throughly enjoyed Spiderman 3, I admit it was a bit overdone and I know a ton of people who hated Spidey's third outing. Pirates 3 was pretty good, but it was too long. The Fantastic Four 2 sucked out loud and every other big summer popcorn movie hasn't delivered what it promised, except Die Hard 4. I was and still am annoyed by the PG-13 Rating, and for weeks before the film opened I was calling it Die Kind Sorta Hard, but the film surprised me. The film I was sure would be a flaming turd turned out to be a fun, diverting, surprisingly clever 2 hours of pure joygasm style entertainment. There is no doubt the movie is flawed, the villain is a wimp, the plot is outlandish but slightly plausible, and there are massive plot holes, but the film still delivers. I have no doubt that if there had been any other character in this film but John McClane, we'd all be tearing this flick a new piehole, but we aren't because the character of John McClane is a winner and he saves this movie from mediocrity. I have no doubt without McClane this movie would be a 5 out of 10, but Willis and his alter ego elevate this material above standard and turn it into something sadly missing this summer pure entertainment. The movie is not a classic like the first one (the best action film of all time), in fact Die Hard 4 is the worst one of the series, and the fact I am still giving it an eight shows how strong this series truly has been. So I would like to take this opportunity to thank John McClane for once again entertaining the hell out of me, and heres hoping we see him again soon.",8,2,6,29 June 2007
