The Blair Witch Project," The public must get some taste!
","I read through articles and comments on The Blair Witch Project and it makes me sick.  To think that some people actually are walking out on this movie. I mean it has to be one of the most original ideas ever put on the silver screen.  Without even spending .1% of the money that Titanic did.  The creators of Blair Witch created something much more enjoyable.  Anyone who can't enjoy this movie needs to get some taste, and quit expecting a senseless form of entertainment.",10,2,4,17 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," A realistic, genuine horror
","First of all, those out there who believe that this movie was awful, watch it again.Blair Witch is a highly original idea in a period of copies and remakes. A movie with genuine fear and horror, and a movie that can scare even the most hardened person.  Complete with the realistic improvizational acting, Blair Witch is an early contender for Best Picture.",10,1,2,10 August 1999
Fight Club," Very Original, Highly Entertaining, A Great Surprise
","Fight Club isn't at all what one might expect it to be.  This movie starts out as a comedy, moves into something straight out of a UFC tournament, then finishes with one of the most surprising endings I have ever seen.  And it is not like the ending is just thrown out there.  It was there all along, but you just don't realize it.  Fight Club is a must see. (You have to see it just to see Meat Loaf with Boobs).",10,0,1,20 October 1999
Forrest Gump," The greatest movie ever written...brilliant.
","All other movies bow down and worship.  Forrest Gump is by far the greatest movie big and small screen.  An outstanding plot with comedy, drama, and action all together.  Follow Forrest through our nation's history as played by the one and only Tom Hanks.",10,0,2,28 February 1999
American Pie," Disappointment of the 'Unrated' version
","Time and time again movies come to video claiming to be the unrated, uncut version.  The same true for the latest release of American Pie.  I love this movie, but when I saw it on tape claiming to be 'The version you couldn't see in theaters'.  I was greatly disappointed.  For of what I could tell only one 3 second clip was different even though the back of the box claimed more of Nadia, more Pie, and so on.  I am just tired of being duped into believing that there is new stuff on these movies.",8,0,0,29 December 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Give me a break.
","I'm sorry to all you out there who think that this is the second best film ever made.  Shawshank, Godfather II, etc, etc.  Obviously you've not seen these great films or just have no taste.What I saw out of this film was 3 long hours of talking, then walking, then talking some more.  Then every fight sequence seemed pretty much the same. 'Oh no, it's the blah blah', boring fight sequence, someone dies slowly, then we'll walk some more.Don't get me wrong it did have it's moments.  The cinematography was good, so let's nominate whoever did this.  Let's NOT nominate this for Best Picture because it was no where near the caliber film to qualify for this honor.  I just hope the Academy is smart enough to recognize this.",1,2,8,12 March 2002
Pitch Black," Great special effects, mediocre plot.
","Pitch Black starts out on a positive note with awesome special effects. It takes several simple undeveloped characters onto a dead planet inhabited only by quick creatures of the night.  Though the plot has much to be desired and isn't much different than the typical horror/suspense/sci fi movie (i.e. Deep Blue Sea), it still comes across as a watchable entertaining movie.  It is well worth watching as long as you are not expecting much, and you thoroughly enjoy mind blowing special effects.",7,0,0,18 February 2000
American History X," Even the worst people can turn their lives around
",American History X has to be one of the most emotional well written films that I have ever seen.  Filled with symbolism and Edward Norton in an excellent acting performance.  This movie is a true example of a movie being shunned because of violent not pc content when in fact it should be seen by all people of any race.,10,0,0,30 January 2000
Resident Evil," Great transfer from game to film.
","It's been quite a while since I first heard of the Resident Evil movie. Back when George Romero was writing a script, and Samatha Mathis from Broken Arrow was going to play Jill Valentine with Bruce Payne as Wesker, I was excited.  Then things seemed to fall apart and the project was in my mind trashed.Slowly things came back together.  A new writer, director, cast, and so on help to bring my confidence back.  Even though the cast seemed to lack a little bit, and the characters were not the same, I was still excited to see the movie when it finally came out this past Friday.Although I understand this could not be considered a great movie, I was very much satisfied with the transfer to film of one of the greatest video games ever made.  I was disappointed with the changed characters, but the story was very much there.  And the special effects and gore were excellent.  I was especially impressed with the dogs in how closely they resembled what you see in the game.Needless to say I was happy with the results, and look forward to the sequel.  If it's anything like the video game series, it only gets better.9/10",9,0,0,19 March 2002
Vanilla Sky," Great original idea.
","I just watch Vanilla Sky for the second time.  I am so glad when a movie comes out which isn't the same old crap.  Vanilla Sky was a great original idea which kept you guessing throughout the whole movie.Tom Cruise (shunned from a Best Actor Nomination) does an excellent job in his role as a confused, depressed man on the verge of insanity.  The direction is amazing with the constant flashes and repeating of lines previously heard throughout the movie.  Halfway through the movie you feel like you haven't even watch anything because you are so confused yourself. In this way you are drawn into Tom Cruise's character.
Seeing it the second time you pick up on everything, which just makes the movie that much better.9/10I also recommend Memento and Fight Club.",9,0,0,12 April 2002
Any Given Sunday," A close look at what makes a football team work...or crumble
","Any Given Sunday takes a good behind the scenes look at a football team. It not only looks into the players, but the coaches, staff, owner, and even the medical trainers.  It was very interesting to see how many things can go into whether or not a football team wins their games.",6,0,0,12 March 2000
