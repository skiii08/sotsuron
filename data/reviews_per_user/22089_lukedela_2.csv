Come and See," A Must See
","Put simply, 'Come and See' is one of the best films I have ever seen. It is also one of the most effective anti-war statements ever produced and many of its images still resonate today, particularly the dark and bleak ending. It works better as an experience rather than as entertainment and should definitely be watched in a single sitting.Amazingly shot, filmed and acted, it serves as one of the pinnacles of Russian Cinema. That being said, it is not a film for the faint of heart. Althrough the actual atrocities in the film make up only a small part of the film, the scene is unrelentingly brutal and there is a prevailing sense of dread throughout the film.Also, there is much controversy about the ending sequence of the film and many people view the film as anti-German and merely Russian propaganda. Personally, I view the film, at face value, as a warning about the dangers of fascism rather than being anti-German. 'Come and See' is not simply a case of condemning Nazism but rather a wider view that everybody has the capacity to do what Hitler did.'Come and See' cannot fail but provoke a reaction in an audience, which very few films actually do and because of this it is universally worth seeing. It is definitely a film that lingers in the memory.",10,7,9,7 July 2006
The Elephant Man," For anyone with a heart
","Easily David Lynch's most accessible film and undoubtedly a classic that is still heartbreaking for me to watch. 'The Elephant Man's' accessibility is undoubtedly owing to Lynch's decision to sparingly use his surrealist style. Lynch's typical traits as a filmmaker are only really evident when relating to Merrick's mother. Also unusually for Lynch, the film has such a positive message and contains such universal sentiments about being an outsider and the desire to be normal that it is difficult not to connect with the film on some level.The ending is one of my favourite scenes ever and is unspeakably beautiful with John Merrick dying and his mother appearing in the sky telling him that 'nothing will die'. His mother, meeting him in the afterlife, becomes the angel that he envisioned. It is really difficult not to react to such a powerful scene and is indicative of the films overwhelming effect on an audience.John Hurt gives a great performance in the role of John Merrick. His acting really arouses sympathy for John Merrick, giving his character a polite and simple friendliness that only contributes to the tragedy of the film.The soundtrack is also perfectly used in 'The Elephant Man' not dominating the film but rather adding to the haunting and melancholy atmosphere of the movie. Silence is also suitably used to add tension to scenes.Although 'The Elephant Man' has a PG rating it is certainly not a film I would recommend to children as it is a disturbing film which is at times extremely discomforting to watch. The human exploitation which Merrick faces from the night porter in the hospital is a good example. I found it such a draining experience to watch as it is an entirely believable account of the treatment Merrick would in reality have received because of his appearance.Although not my favourite film by David Lynch, this will always remain a personal favourite. A film that I probably will not revisit to often but when I do will always have a profound effect on me.",9,1,1,8 July 2006
