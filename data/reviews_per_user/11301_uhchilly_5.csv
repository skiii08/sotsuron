Black Swan," Character study without character
","I went into this movie with no expectations other than knowing some Aronovsky films and liking them. I didn't see any trailers so I was really happy to jump into a film without any serious preconceived notions.I do have some spoilers in here to stop now if you don't want to know anything!I have to say that I really enjoyed the acting and the story both - the problem I had was the way it was told. The lines of the story are already laid out in the title of the movie and it doesn't deviate an inch from what your initial, most obvious conclusion would be. That in itself wouldn't be a big deal if, through this journey elements of the character are revealed, illuminated somehow but again, nothing seems to expand on the initial character we see in the first several minutes. Instead all I saw was variant portrayals of her particular psychosis each more dramatic and vulgar than the last but providing no different perspective. Like watching a slide show of anonymous personal injuries. These moments just upset us and then move along leaving an empty feeling.After a while the 'watch-out-behind-you'or 'see-you-imagined-it' scenes get really tiresome and are better left to the Final Destinations and Grudge's of moviedom. What starts out with genuine tension and disturbing curiosity as to what exactly is going on (her rash, the hallucinations of herself) seems to just continually repeat itself without any purpose other than to shock. I like shock just not when its trying so hard to be meaningful (or seeming to).So you have over-use of shock value (she hallucinates and then wonders - did that happen? REPEATEDLY AGAIN AND AGAIN OK. we get it.) Pile that on with the obvious metaphor of the production of the Black Swan which in and of itself is groovy, the two stories paralleling each other but when you couple the horror shock aspect with the uber-dramatized story within a story of the Black Swan coupled with seriously dramatic music (great music but so much overkill for an abundantly dramatic story and story-telling style) it all just becomes too much wherein some points I felt became unintentionally funny because I was just hit too many times in the head with the shock-hammer. Part of this was likely do to poor shot choice eg.(pivotal scene in Nina's dressing room between Acts) - it was just plain silly, like watching some monster movie - off-camera monster drags off its kill.I think had any one of these elements been played with a bit more subtlety, perhaps the soundtrack, a reduced amount of repetitive hallucinations and/or shocking grossness (and I love gory movies but even the gore-masters know when and how to do it) or play down the actual parallels a bit more so we are not constantly reminded of how she is just like the Black Swan, then this could have been a good movie.It just seemed like a director who became too enamoured with his ideas and decided to let them all loose in one film and it unfortunately become a ham-fisted disappointment albeit with great acting.I would actually give it a 6.5 but I feel it deserves a lower rating simply because my expectations went from positive to very positive as I was watching it only for me to helplessly watch the movie circle the drain along with its main character.

The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Typical teen story, clunky writing
","As a few other reviewers have said, this film has the typical storyline of the outcast teen with misfit friends going through high school. My biggest problems with it is the writing. The dialogue is really clunky and comes off totally inauthentic. The characters don't develop any real chemistry except for Patrick and Charlie, as the rest of them seem very cardboard - like all they are is a character synopsis.Both Lerman and Watson were ineffectual in their roles adding nothing to the decidedly poor material they were given. Her delivery was deliberate and forced and the entire time I couldn't help but feel there was an over-instructive director guiding her every move. I think that is reflected in most of the performances - forced and limited at the same time. This goes for everyone and it seems to back to the writing again and again.Much more reflective of made-for-TV writing, at least when it comes to the characters and their words.Lastly the music. Even though I like the music (I grew up with it), it was completely wrong for the movie and only added to the inauthentic feel. This movie takes place, presumably, in the 2010s but the music they all listen to is from 20-30 years ago. The music is masquerading as the current play-list for this generation. It isn't background music, it is actually a big part of the movie with mixed tapes being exchanged etc. Yet I think it does a complete disservice to the characters to presume that they would identify so strongly with music that their parents would have listened too instead of something more contemporary. It just doesn't ring true.I'm hearing these characters gush about the Smiths when none of them were even born when the band broke up; it just makes no sense (XTC,Cocteau Twins on their OMG I LOVE them! list????). I think the characters deserved more and the film's plausibility really suffers for it .",4,3,6,2 February 2013
3:10 to Yuma," pretending to be a good movie
","I was so wanting to love this movie but the extremely tedious pace and poorly written Wade character, who so obviously should have been written better, destroyed this movie. I'm all for subtlety and a certain degree of ambiguity in characterizations and I prefer it in fact to blunt exposition but this film managed to do blunt exposition that revealed little of interest about his character. It did all this while appearing to subtly reveal a strange kinship between the two that never really materialized in any satisfying fashion. The main characters spent their time grimacing a lot trying to look like they were undergoing some profound exchange but it was just fluff. The acting was terrific but even the great Prince character became dull. No consistency in the characters (specifically Wade and Prince accepted) and a what I thought was the films obvious sense of its own importance overshadowing good storytelling. Terrible leaps of logic expected of the audience in the end when the first part of the film is so pedantically realistic it felt like I was watching the stuff that DIDN'T make it into the most boring reality TV.A real, REAL disappointment. And worst of all, not entertaining. Even some really terrible pics are at least that.",3,2,7,19 September 2007
Watchmen," Alan Moore was right...
","One way reading (books or graphic novels) differ from movies is that they don't rely on motion. Continuous motion. With books you can digest the words and pictures and absorb their meaning at a pace that permits you to develop your own understanding at your OWN pace. Its how really complicated stories get told very well. Watchmen as a graphic novel is second to none and both in its original monthly format and in its compiled form, lets you go back, re-read, examine the art, embrace the connections and the meaning. Movies can achieve a similar feeling but because they are slave to time (unlike Dr. Manhattan) the information is ALWAYS coming at you, never giving you any time to really appreciate the gravity of any particular scene. I have to agree with the folk who couldn't stand it, even though I think it was very well made, sadly it fails completely in providing the gravitas that the graphic novel does because its creators fail to realize that you cannot just translate these things shot for shot. It just doesn't work. Neither does this movie. (and the violence was just pointless and groan inducing, way too much and it totally detracted from the high-brow story.) Bleh.",5,1,4,8 March 2009
Into the Wild," definition of a bad movie
","This movie is it. It was very difficult to separate my own personal taste from objective review but after a day or two of simmering I think I can encapsulate my thoughts on this truly disappointing movie.Basic things like expository narration. This is a movie not a radio play. Having the redundant narration of his sister (which was very poorly done) sounding like an actor reading through lines in a coffee shop rehearsal lacked authenticity and constantly removed you from the ability to make your own conclusions about the emotional state of the characters. The choice to have on multiple occasions Chris stare directly at the camera utterly baffled me. Moments like that (say at the ending of Magnolia) should generally be reserved for situations where character and audience through the weight and momentum of the story are drawn to some mutual realization (not exclusively but you get my drift). Once is maybe OK but, again, as with the narration, the self-centred direction is encouraging us to accept the movie's supposed profundity by continually doing this amateurish nonsense rather than having the confidence to let the story stand on its own merit. Very, very lame direction there.The dialogue was utterly unbelievable and preachy. Now I can take a story with a moral focus or political slant as much as the next guy but it seems like a case of a writer not having a clue what a screenplay is supposed to be. Actions should be more important than words or at least on equal footing but in this movie, words are not parts of conversations between the characters or even thoughtful narration but rather some sermon directed AT the audience. The movie was like its own good review..'Look at how sublime I am! Look at how profound I am!'The acting by everyone except Hirsch was good. Hirsch was a single note playing for two and half hours. Zero empathy was derived from his monochrome performance. The character begins self-centred and dies self-centred. It could be argued that his 'call it by its real name' blathering was monumental change in his character that was the culmination of this journey but it was sabotaged by an actor with no range and a director with no confidence in either the story or its performers. Instead we are left with everything being spelled out for us ..yet again.. about how seeing the world through Chris' eyes is the only way to see the world.The only reason I didn't give I a single star was because it looked great. This movie was a pretty big insult I think, since attempts to spiritualize a character or more correctly, spiritualize his 'experiences', without ever giving the audience a chance to empathize. Instead we get sermonized. This DVD is only good as a coaster for my drink.",2,60,114,11 March 2008
