Hereditary," A doubtless MASTERPIECE!
","The best word I can use to describe the greatness of this movie is 'masterpiece'!
The director create a unexpected environment in his work.
To be honest, at first I thought it's a drama!
But gradually the movie came out like a tremendous storm and destroyed all things that I had been imagined.",10,1,2,10 February 2019
