Men in Black 3," Back In Black! - And better than ever!
","I was extremely skeptical about this movie... so much so that I was going to refuse to watch it. The last MIB movie was absolutely terrible and had forever tarnished the franchise's reputation in my eyes.A couple friends of mine were talking about the movie and were interested in seeing it so I thought, fine, I'll give it a try (it wasn't MY money I was wasting!).Coming out of the movie, I was very impressed! This third installment reverts back to the roots of MIB, recreating all of the elements that made you fall in love with the boys in black to begin with.NOTABLE: Josh Brolin's performance is outstanding!; both the plot and subplot are amazingly well written. I always appreciate intelligent quips and little hints to major revelations; Loved the addition of the guide! Great character!; The villain in this movie is another great character and also well performed; the time travel scenario utilized in this movie was a big risk that could have gone terribly wrong. Instead, it was a brilliant move and well played. My appreciation of the MIB franchise has been revived.",10,0,4,16 June 2012
