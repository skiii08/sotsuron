United 93," Reality as Art
","Sometimes an artist tries to interpret reality, heighten it, and massage it in order to make clearer its real meaning. But there are some rare realities that are so overpowering that they stand alone and any massaging can only diminish it. Unfortunately, in most cases, the ego of the artist cannot resist the imperative to try and clarify further. The director in this film has successfully resisted these natural artistic impulses, and in so doing allowed the art of reality to manifest itself, as itself. That in itself signals an artist of a higher caliber.This is not a documentary. It is indeed an artistic film.Beyond art, the reality of the events are straightforward. There are no political statements, no indictments, no rah-rah. We see failure and we see heroism in equal parts as normal people react to crisis. We see competence and incompetence hand in hand. We decisions made and responsibility taken in one moment, to be negated by incompetence or a flawed system in the next.This film shows us a massive system designed to protect us break down in chaos and confusion. Those elements of the system capable of processing information and those capable of acting were not in concert. The weakest link of the chain doomed the system.The only group who was able to process information effectively and act on it were normal Americans just like us. The North American Air Defense Command, the FAA, the Air Force, the CIA, the FBI were unable to save thousands of lives and an irreplaceable American landmark of the soul on that day despite the desire and will to do so. But Tom Burnett and the others on Flight 93 were.If there is a message in this film. Perhaps that is it. Each of us may be required to take action some day in defense of ourselves, and something larger than ourselves. We are America, not some far away FAA official, not a local police agency, not some Colonel in some underground command center, not a Department full of federal employees.We must take our survival, and that of our country, into our own hands from time to time.

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Loads of Fun
","Thrill ride of a movie with a memorable quirky performance by Johnny Depp. Destined to be the classic Pirate movie.  Has the same fun feel as Indiana Jones went it first came out.  Plenty of cannons, undead creatures, curses, gold coins, grappling hooks, and plenty of Johnny Depp.  An excellent supporting cast, particularly Geoffrey Rush's portrayal of a pirate captain and a Royal Governor's Daughter who looks good in both a corset and British Navy pants.  The kids and adults loved it.  After a long dry spell, Disney remembers what entertainment is.",10,0,1,9 July 2003
Gangs of New York," Place and Time But not People Picture
","If you have an interest in obscure corners of history that affected the development of what we are today then you will enjoy this picture.  If you are looking for pure entertainment, a classic story, or an appealing romance, then you probably want to just move along.But I am one of the former and I enjoyed the spectacle.  Watching the movie prompted me to head on out to the net and do some 'Five Points' surfing to get the real facts behind a story I had not heard before.  This is a 'place and time' picture that is visually rich and does a great job of capturing the mood and atmosphere of an obscure, and not very pretty, moment of our history.But the people who inhabit this world are pretty much cardboard cutouts, or worse, with the exception of the villain who successfully possessed the body of Daniel Day Lewis.  Despite Lewis's grand attempt this is not a character driven movie.  The real main character was the city of New York.Lewis puts on an incredible performance.  One of the finest characterizations of the villain I've seen.  Even though the character is palpably evil every time he appears on screen, Lewis makes you understand him and, at times, empathize with him.Nothing of the sort can be said for the supporting cast.  Leonardo DiCaprio waltzed through this film without even bothering to maintain his fake Irish accent in half his scenes.  The idea that any character played by DiCaprio could have survived 16 years in an 1846 New York Reform Prison is ludicrous. Miscast AND bad acting is an unpleasant combinationCameron Diaz went to the outer edge of her limited range, but unfortunately that range does not extend to any role that takes place earlier than 1994. Seeing Cameron Diaz in this picture was, in some ways, more shocking than seeing a Chevy Corvette driving past Boss Tweed's carriage would have been.Speaking of Boss Tweed, a passable job of acting in that portrayal.  But in this movie, passable acting stands out.But I did enjoy the movie.  I was able to concentrate on Lewis, ignore all the rest, and learn something about an interesting place and time.",8,0,0,17 July 2003
