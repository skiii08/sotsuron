Ali," Ali Shmali
","I can't say that I really enjoyed this movie. Tolerated would be a better word. It was sort of like getting a haircut, although a bit more unnecessary. Just kind of, whatever.First of all, why did they even make a movie about Ali to start with? He's at best a mediocre talent. He's certainly no Jack Dempsey, or even Louis Gossett Jr from Diggstown. He was ok. He won a few fights, but did he ever capture a nation's attention like Mary Lou Retton did in the Olympics? I think not. Nobody will ever forget her. That's for sure. She had heart and a fantastic outgoing personality. Those kind of traits can take you far. She was just a talented spunky girl with boatloads of Moxie.I'm also not sure why they cast the Fresh Prince of Bell Air to be Ali. I mean, it's not like Ali was a poor kid from Philly who went to live with his rich Uncle in California, was he? Did he have a cousin named Carlton who danced funny? Did he have a best friend who would get hilariously thrown out of the mansion when he made fun of the calorically challenged Uncle? No, no, and a resounding no.Golly, Ali, I would've rather seen Along Came Polly.",Null,0,1,6 February 2004
Radio," Dial R for Radio
","As far as sports movies go, Radio is right there between Rudy and Necessary Roughness. Radio should have gone straight to TNT (the cable channel, not the stuff used to blow up things, although that's not an entirely bad idea).Ed Harris reprises his role of the tough minded family man that will eventually come to realize what's truly important in life, with the help of some sort of good hearted person, or a traumatic event, or in this case both, played by Radio. Alfre Woodard does a credible job in her typical role as the voice of reason.This movie also has a cop named Irv. Need I say more. Ok, I will. Irv.There's the punk kid who gives Radio a hard time. Will he come around to learn the error of his ways? Does Radio end up touching his cold little heart? Will this film make salty tears stream down your cheek with the inspirational soul music playing in the background at all times?To find out the answer to these and more questions, turn on the 'Radio'.Lastly, and more than probably leastly, we have Cuba Gooding Jr.
Cuba's portrayal of the mentally challenged Radio was eerily reminiscent of Cuba Gooding Jr. in Jerry Maguire, or Cuba Gooding Jr. in Snow Dogs, or Cuba Gooding Jr. in Rat Race, or Cub...well, you get the point.
If you have a yearning to see Cuba Gooding Jr. jumping and dancing around like Chris Kattan on a sugar high, while enjoying a somewhat watchable, yet most definitely formulaic sports movie, then by all means tune in...Radio.",Null,0,1,10 February 2004
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Wow
","This movie was pretty good, although a tad bit unrealistic.
I liked the scenes where people were talking and joking around, but they should have had more action sequences, a la Rambo, or The Terminator.
The guy who made this movie probably should have spoken to a couple of people who were actually there (the war), because he was about as close to accurate as Superman II was to Lunar Exploration, when the 3 evil castaways from Krypton go to the moon and kill the astronauts.I think some special effects would have given this film a little extra juice. Maybe some laser guns. Colored smoke bombs and Ninja would have been super. How about having the troops be led by Mr Miyagi? He could have given them invaluable wisdom. Plus we all would have learned something. I know that I walked away from the Karate Kid a better person.If you're looking for a good sci-fi type movie, then by all means rent Apocalypse Now. But if you want a healthy dose of reality in your movie, you may be better off seeing Kramer vs Kramer, or any movie with Cuba Gooding Jr, as he does nothing but keep it real.",Null,0,1,9 February 2004
Mulholland Drive," The Box
","This movie should have been called 'The Box', because that's what it's all about. Really, a movie about a box? Couldn't come up with something a bit more original, Mr Linch?The acting in this movie was ok. Nothing special. Pretty much what you'd come to expect in this type of movie. The acting in this movie is on a par with 'Anaconda', 'Romancing the Stone', and 'Barber Shop', which was much funnier, by the way. This movie could have used some comic relief, a la Cedric the Entertainer, or maybe a funny dog, like the one in 'Turner and Hooch'.Another thing that bothered me is how this 'movie', so blatantly ripped of Bound. 2 Women. Ooooooh. If I want to see that type of naughtiness, I can just head on down to my local video store's back room. It's not like the ladies in this movie were really even that good looking. Couldn't they have gotten Pam Anderson, or even one of her co-stars from V.I.P.?I also didn't really understand this movie. I know it was about the box, but I didn't really 'get it'. It gave me a headache. Why was this movie called 'Mulholland Drive'? Is that the street that he was drunkenly walking down when he tripped over this script that some wino wrote for kicks?I hope it's the street Mr Linch will drive away on. For good.",Null,0,1,4 February 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," This Movie is OK, sort of
","I both liked and disliked this movie at the same time. Kinda like my parents.I liked Elliot and the little girl that was also in Firestarter, which, by the way, was a hot movie. I thought the scene when they dressed the alien like a ghost and went trick or treating, then ended up flying on the bicycle was absolutely adorable. I think that Mr Kubrick was really on top of his game when he wrote that scene. I put the box of Kleenex that I usually keep next to my bed to good use during that scene.Now for the bad.Reese's Pieces? Really. Who eats those things? Do they even make them anymore? Would it have killed them to use some M&Ms? Way to go Stanley. Cute little aliens visit our planet and all you can think of to give them is Reese's Pieces? Why not just give them a Charlston Chew. Or perhaps a Reggie Bar.Anyway. This movie was ok, if you ask me. I'd compare it to Earth Girls are Easy, or perhaps White Men Can't Jump.I'd suggest seeing this movie if you can rent it for $1.99 or less.",Null,2,5,3 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Give Me Back My Money!!!
","This movie was bad on so many levels. Well, at least 3 levels, but that's 2 more than Disorderlies, which was bad only because of the Fat Boys. Although they do comprise many levels, especially if you count their chins, of which they have more than a Chinese Phone Book.Firstly, what a snoozer this movie was. I can't even really give a complete review, because I kept falling asleep. Couldn't they have added a few action sequences. Maybe some dramatic tension to keep people's eyes open. I felt like I was listening to the soothing sounds of gentle raindrops, while watching Elves frolicking in the woods.Now, has there ever been a movie been more insulting to little people since Danny DeVito was doing movies? Hobbits, Dwarfs, and Orcs, oh My! Why didn't they just have them follow the Yellow Brick Road? Possibly find the Cowardly Lion some Courage. Or help the Tin Man get a Heart. At least The Wizard of Oz had singing. I will admit, the singing was very mediocre, but at least they tried.This movie needed some real stars. Maybe a Vin Diesel, or perhaps they could have had Michael Clarke Duncan play an Orc. Hulk Hogan would have given this snoozer a well needed shot in the arm.Return of the King?How about Return of my Money.",Null,0,1,3 February 2004
