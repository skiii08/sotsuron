Walk the Line," Top acting
","Even though the movie is long, it is definitely worth it. It might not be the best movie I have seen but the acting performances are truly great. Phoenix is very convincing as a lost soul. I was actually amazed to realize it is actually their own voices you hear. I am not familiar with most of Cash' work but Witherspoon and Phoenix were very convincing. One of the nicest things about the movie I found is to watch a man who can be loving and caring one moment and the next scene he can be as scary as only Jack Nicholson can be. Phoenix and Witherspoon deserve their nominations.7 out of 10 for the movie. 10 out of 10 for the acting.",7,0,0,5 February 2006
Crash," Brilliant film
","One of the best movies I have seen over the last couple of years. Even though different stories are told they all blend together and make you realize how easy it is to judge and be prejudiced. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat constantly, at times it makes you angry, sometimes it makes you melt, other times it makes you laugh. The acting is great across the board. Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle are brilliant in their roles. It made me realize that their is good and bad in all of us and that the two co-exist. I really liked the way the different stories were built up and how they came together. Brilliant movie.10 out of 10.",10,1,8,15 February 2006
City of God," Tough movie
","Very tough movie portraying the lives of kids/teenagers in one of Rio's favelas. What I liked most about the movie is the way in which it is told, through the eyes of one of the kids who manages to escape the harsh reality of the favela. I also like the flashback following the opening scene in which a group of kids tries to catch an escaped rooster. The freeze-frame shots are very nice as well. It is a very fast paced movie and sometimes it is hard to keep track of all that is happening especially because the movie covers a couple of decades. I saw this movie after visiting Rocinha in Rio the week before. I did not realize until after having seen the movie that Seu Jorge plays the role of Mane Galinha. He makes beautiful music these days and one of his quotes is really frightening 'The other actors were ... curious. They wanted to know if the favelas are really like that. I said unfortunately they're much worse.'",8,3,6,6 February 2006
