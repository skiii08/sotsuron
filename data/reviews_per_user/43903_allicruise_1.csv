The Expendables 2," been waiting for this since late 80's or early 90's
","the movie is great but I've been waiting for this to happen since i was a kid that was late 80's and early 90's. back then I've heard its not possible due to the agents of sly and Arnie. it could be better during that time when they are still in their 30's and 40's.i wish they will make a expendables spoof version staring the best comedians like: jack black, Zach Galifianakis, Chris tucker, Adam Sander, Ben stiller, rob Schneider, Jim Carey etc.can we make a petition for this movie to happen? :-)more power and more expendables movie to comeAlli",10,2,4,27 May 2013
