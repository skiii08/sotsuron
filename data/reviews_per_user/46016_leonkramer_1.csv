Skyfall," They Didn't Even Try
","Wow, this movie sucked from A-Z.Since James Bond plays in the present time and you can't see space ships or flying cars, I suppose that we live in the same reality. Yet Skyfall differs from our world so you can only get the feeling the producers just did an extremely awful job researching.Skyfall reminds me of Casino Royale. There insanely rich guys play poker for all their money in a setting, in which any skill that exists in the game of poker was eliminated because the initial blinds are insanely high already. Just poor research, but was it a one time flaw?In Skyfall the plot is about an encoded list that has been stolen and obviously has been decoded by someone, who must be the very best hacker on this planet by far, i.e. an former 00-agent. However, anyone who spent only some effort in computer technology and encryption knows that there are very common encryption mechanisms that are just not decipherable in the current state and that are not even the most advanced.So, we can only assume that MI6 just sucks ass at using computers. Okay, are at least the bad guys smarter? You decide: Bad guy enters a skyscraper in Shanghai, kills some guards and takes the lift to some higher level. There he gets in position with a sniper having a great view to an nearby apartment in which some Asian guys walk around. Then an old guy enters the apartment and sits down, having the bad guy in his back. He, the bad guy, pulls the trigger and kills the old Asian dude. Now you think the other Asian guys should be shocked and panic, but no, apparently they are part of the plan and instantly carry the dead guy somewhere. Well, now what the f**k is the logic behind this? Was killing that guy with a sniper from another skyscraper and killing a couple of guards on the way up easier than just killing the guy within the other apartment? Probably not, but hell, it looks damn interesting.The whole movie is the same way. It's so far from reality, not cleverly done at all. The producers don't even try to explain anything to the viewers. Nothing makes sense. Who the f**k cares? It's James Bond, dude! Guarantee for success.",1,31,58,21 November 2012
