The Blair Witch Project," These are the dumbest kids ever.
","People have said that this film is scary.  Excuse me?  I don't see how a pile of rocks and some harmless twigs constitute a threat to anyone, and it sure didn't give me any butterflies in my tummy.  And I was revolted by the seemingly endless arguing by mindless twits over where the map was.Instead of developing any sense of concern for the characters, I began hoping they would die soon so I could get on with my afternoon.The filmmakers purported this to be a true story.  If three grown people can't find their way out of the woods for a week in Maryland, they deserve whatever fate comes to them.  If you haven't seen this film, save your time and money.",2,0,1,27 September 1999
