The King's Speech," A Film That Speaks To Everyone
","The Kings Speech is a film that I honestly think is an achievement, a film about a royal family member with a stammer really shouldn't have been such a compelling and beautiful film to watch but it was. Probably the most common complaint about this film is that it is widely considered to be 'Oscar Bait' well if that means a beautifully written film with amazing performances that is never boring or dull then that's fine by me because this is a truly fantastic film. The biggest praise I could give this movie is that it legitimately makes you care for its lead character, the film takes the time to show you just how much King George's stammer effected him not only privately with his family but also publicly where you saw the self humiliation he endured and it's all done perfectly. While the beautiful script had a large part in this it was truly Colin Firths magnificent performance that carried this film, through his performance you understand just how much he endured and you feel the fear he felt in taking the crown and his fear in his own voice, Firth won an Oscar for his performance and it was very well deserved. While no one steals the spotlight from Firth there are plenty other performances that truly shined in this film mainly Geoffrey Rush. Rush is just so likable in this film he has fantastic chemistry with Firth but he was also a very well written character, you understood his need to help people, his past was very well developed and added something to his character. Helena Bonham Carter completely departs from her usual work and gives the best performance of her career in this film, she was such a supportive character to Colin Firth she made me legitimately smile in some places when she comforts her husband and doesn't make this film to sad to endure. This film is not all sad and gloomy it's a very uplifting and inspiring film that does have some really good humour to it. Guy Pearce can be a very good actor when he wants to be and he clearly wanted to be in this film because he did a great job in this movie, his character was despicable and Pearce clearly eats it all up and it adds to the torment of Firths character, but my biggest complaint about this film is his character arc, not enough time was taken to truly justify some of the decisions his character makes and didn't feel earned when he made them. This is a performance piece, this film relies entirely on its lead performances and there was not a bad one in sight, this film is inspirational an uplifting, Colin Firth is incredible in the film and will not stop reiterating how impressed I was at how compelling this film was. 91%/A",9,1,2,8 December 2016
Moneyball," I Don't Even Like Baseball
","I hate sports, I really do but I love movies and this one peaked my interest and I decided to watch it and I was thoroughly impressed by what I saw. The filmmakers To a really good job of making you care about the success of The Oakland Athletics because they take the time to show you just how bad a state they are in. They also take the time to build the characters so that you understand how important it is for them to succeed. Brad Pitt was fantastic in this film not only did he have some really great one liners but he had a great heart to him you felt sorry for him through seeing his last failings and I really loved his chemistry with Jonah Hill who was also great in this film up until The Wolf of Wall Street this was his best performance ever, I loved his character because he was easy to relate to, that new kid quality does that and I thought Hill did a great job with some of the more emotional scenes. The baseball scenes are filmed terrifically there done in a very documentation style which makes them feel more life like. The relationship between Pitt and his daughter was a really nice touch it made you care more about him and gave you a sense of who he was as a person not just a manager. I liked the fact that they made this film feel real, you completely understand how bad the odds are against this new system, you see them be put down, get angry at defeats and face dismissal and it makes you care all the more about this team succeeding. The late great Phillip Seymour Hoffman was in this movie and he did a great job, I really liked his character he didn't agree with this system and it let you get the series of events from the players perspective and added a more personal touch to the games. I do have a few flaws with this film, for one Chris Pratts character was very wasted, at first it seemed as if they were setting up a good arc for his character but they don't give it the time required to make you care and just ends up being unnecessary. I also thought that they should have taken the time to see the teams success instead of simply shown it in a montage as it didn't give the victories any emotional weight and was an unsatisfactory conclusion to such a good story arc. Despite hating sports I really enjoyed this movie, I loved Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill, you really got invested in the characters and the team and the sporting sequences themselves were very well done. 84%/A-",8,6,7,26 November 2016
Blade Runner 2049," One of The Best Sequels Ever Made - A Masterpiece
","This movie was not going to disappoint me, all the marketing for Blade Runner 2049 had me thinking that this movie was gonna be incredible, it had one of my favourite directors working today at the helm, the same writer as the original and looked like a faithful continuation of the original, as I had hoped this movie was absolutely incredible.The script for this movie was perfect, it made the world still feel like the one we knew from the first one, like it's been through so much since the first one only worse and it always felt like a gradual development. Every character in this movie has a good motivation and backstory, no one felt like they didn't have a purpose to play and I really got invested in all of them, even if some of the more villainous characters. The mystery that weaves this film together was really well done, so compelling and I really wanted to know the answers to the questions raised. As soon as I heard that Denis Villeneuve was going to direct this movie I knew he would be a perfect fit, Arrival was my favourite movie of 2016 so I knew he could do Sci-Fi and like everything else in this film it lived up to my expectations. There aren't a lot of action scenes in this movie but when there is he is very good at making them look realistic and gritty which gave them real tension, he used lighting very well to sell the location and state of the world and he gave this film such a good tone, a dark yet hopeful one. At this point Villeneuve could take over any franchise and I'd be convinced it was in perfect hands. All the performances in this movie were fantastic and I could not have imagined anyone else playing the characters in this movie. Ryan Gosling was brilliant as K, you knew he had a real moral complexity to his actions in this film and he really play his characters isolation very well. Harrison Ford was phenomenal as Deckard, he played him as a very traumatised man that Ford made sympathetic and it felt as if he was playing the same character as he did in the original not just someone else entirely. Ana de Armas was a real surprise in this movie, she wasn't just a love interest but a real character with depth that I really cared about. Jared Leto could have been in the movie more but he really played this morally grey and mysterious character very well and always kept my attention when he was on screen. The look of this movie was jaw dropping I loved that they really expanded on the world not just through dialogue but visually as well. The different environments all look distinctive and sell the off balance system of the planet rather than just telling the audience that it is. A lot of this has to do with the cinematography, everything looks incredible, the rainy city streets, dusty landscapes and snowy locations all look immaculate but never like they are in a film but part of a larger world. All of the special effects are amazing, they weren't used to an unnecessary degree but only way practical effects weren't an option and they always looked real like they should be. Blade Runner 2049 was a masterpiece, if it's not better than the original it is at least equal to it. Everything from the direction, characters, performances, special effects, cinematography and world building were perfect for what they needed to bring to this movie. It's the best movie of the year so far and is proof that sequels, even ones that took as long as this, can be every bit as good and though provoking as there originals. 10/10: A+ (Incredible)",10,7,19,8 October 2017
Frost_Nixon," One of Howard's Finest
","I love interview movies, movies that centre around an important interview and all the trails that come with it so as you can imagine Frost/Nixon immediately appealed to me and was definitely worth the watch. I thought this film was fantastic with two excellent lead performances. Frank Langella gives the performance of his life in this film he's truly amazing at portraying a fragile and fearful man trying to regain some humanity that he lost to his presidency. Michael Sheen was also really good in this movies you could tell just how badly he wanted this interview and how desperate he was to get it done right. The actual interviews themselves were very well executed, the tactics that went into both their sides leaves you riveted and intrigued and makes Nixon eventual apology feel earned and all the more satisfying, I wasn't alive to watch the actual interviews but I can imagine they felt the same way they do in the movie. Ron Howard did such a good job at directing this movie he makes sure that your always engaged and riveted by what your seeing and turned what could have been a boring and melodramatic drama into something much better than that. The chemistry between Nixon and Frost is great the tension between them and some of their more personal scenes made the film all the better. However I do have a few flaws for one I didn't like the documentary style flash forwards with the characters it just felt weird and out of place and ultimately just unnecessary. The film also does suffer from it taking some time to find it's footing but eventually does. I really like Rebecca Hall and she was really good in this movie but I didn't really get her character I don't know if her character was a part of the real life events but even if that's the case I still didn't think she fit her relationship with Frost just comes out of nowhere and is mostly skipped over. Overall Frost/Nixon is a fantastic film with a great main conflict and performances and is by far one of Ron Howard's greatest achievements. 85%/A-",8,0,0,7 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Star Wars Film That Fails To Leave An Impression
","When I was younger and watched every film in the Star Wars franchise I pretty much liked all of them including this one. While today I still hold the same opinion on most of them The Phantom Menace and Attack of The Clones have fallen down majorly to me and this film in particular suffers the most from that in my mind. Like Attack of The Clones I don't think this is a bad film I just didn't think it was anything special but unlike that film I didn't find anything truly satisfying in this film. But there is still plenty of positives, for one the action sequences are all brilliant, all the lightsaber fights and space ship combat are all perfectly directed by George Lucas and in these scenes the film truly does entertain me. Darth Maul was also a fantastic antagonist, he was completely threatening, despite not saying much he left such an impression on anyone watching this film and is the most memorable thing ago this film for me. Another thing I liked about this movie was Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor they both had really good chemistry and it was nice to see a new interpretation of Obi Wan as a less experienced and more reckless character. But every thing else in this film just falls apart. The cripplingly slow pacing of this film lead to so many boring sequences that make this film unbearable to watch at times. While I liked the two protagonists the rest of cast had no development, backstory of anything unique to them. The senate scenes in particular are so bad, they have no real need to be in this film or at the very least could have been focused on less, it makes you forget that your watching a Star Wars film and more of a mediocre political thriller. Now I didn't personally think Jake Lloyd was that bad in this film I just think the writing for his character was the problem, we never got the impression that this child was as special as he had been made out to be and was honestly just an annoying character. This film also changes certain things from the original trilogy that just didn't need to be changed such as the explanation of The Force, this just makes the whole concept of it seem less magical and more dull and didn't belong in this film or any Star Wars film honestly. The last battle of this film is very muddled, the battle being split into three like it was the Return of The Jedi just didn't work as well for this film as the characters hadn't been as nearly well developed as they were in that movie. Overall The Phantom Menace was a fairly dull movie in terms of characters, plot and pacing, it's boring at times but not without it's entertaining portions. Don't get me wrong I don't hate this film nearly as much as other Star Wars fans do but when compared to the rest of the franchise it just doesn't stand out nearly as much. 60%/C+",6,0,1,2 January 2017
War Dogs," The Most Underrated Movie of 2016
","War Dogs was one of my most anticipated movies of 2016 it looked like it could be the next Wolf of Wall Street and while it definitely didn't reach those heights I still think that this is an amazing movie and a very underrated one at that. I've always been interested when comedic directors decide to take on more serious projects and while this still has plenty of comedy in it this is still a drama and Todd Phillips knocked it out of the park he's amazing at keeping a fast pace during both the arms dealing scenes and action sequences. While there isn't a whole lot of action sequences in this film but when there is it's extremely entertaining and they've got a lot of tension to them because you can tell neither of these characters have seen up close what they cause with the weapons they sell. You get the risks of the business they're by it just being implied but when they get involved with bigger fish like Bradley Coopers character you can really tell what they've gotten themselves into. While you never respect what Miles Tellers character does you understand why he's doing it to provide for his family and make a name for himself, these are motivations that anyone can get behind and makes him more relate able as a character. Miles Teller and Jonah Hill both have fantastic chemistry with each other they defiantly feel like life long friends who slowly start to lose their friendship to their business. While Miles Teller was great Jonah Hill was really the man who stole this movie he's very reminiscent of Gordon Gekko in this film he's obviously hilarious that's something we've come to expect from Hill but he's surprisingly a very intense character in a few scenes and that's something we've never really seen from him. There are a few flaws with this movie and the biggest one of the subplot of Tellers characters wife, it's just not very interesting and just amounts to a few scenes of arguing between them in the end. Bradley Cooper in the end is really just fine in this film he's a bit bland but did what he had to. War Dogs is an amazing film it's entertaining and hilarious with mostly great performances and an interesting story. Defiantly disagree with the critics on this one. 92%/A",9,1,4,27 October 2016
Skyfall," One of The Greatest Action Films of All Time
","Skyfall is always going to be a special film for me. It's the first Bond film I ever saw in theatres and I vividly remember the hype this film had from Everyone around me. The film was everything I wanted it to be and more, to date it is my favourite Bond film of all time and, for my money, one of the best action films of all time.One of the best things about Craig's film is that they make Bond into an actual character. He has his weaknesses and strengths and they're all conveyed perfectly in a way that makes him a better protagonist. Daniel Craig is again amazing as Bond it's a much more subtle performance than before that make his more emotional scenes a lot more fulfilling. It also gives the character a past and allows the audience to better understand how he became the man he did.Sam Mendes is a terrific director, despite him not being know for action before this film I think he absolutely nailed it with this film. The action is absolutely pulse pounding and gritty, there's not a single action scene that isn't great and improves massively over the shaky nonsense that was present in Quantum. The film also looks spectacular thanks to Roger Deakin's cinematography, every single location looks different and every frame is visually alive . Without a doubt the best looking bond film of all time.A great villains can make or break a bond films so it's so gratifying to say that this film has a truly wonderful one. Silva, played to perfection by Javier Bardem is a magnificent villain and one of bonds best foes. He has a fantastic backstory that really makes him a more personal villain than most villain. It's also great to see another unhinged villain in the bind series. The character is completely insane and it makes for a captivating presence. Bardem nailed his performance, another villain he played perfectly.More than any other bond film, Skyfall made excellent use of its supporting cast. They all have a part to play big or small. Judi Dench gives her best performance as M in this film, her chemistry with Craig is perfect that makes the film about their relationship just as much as anything else. Moneypenny has a perfect return to the series, with her excellent chemistry with Bond and giving her a backstory as opposed to the fairly one note character that was present in the other iterations. It was also great to see Q back in the franchise as a younger less experienced version of the character. He has an excellent back and forth with Bond that creates for comedy gold and excellent dialogue. It's great to see Ralph Fiennes in the film that establishes him as a new presence in the franchise that makes it more satisfying to see him continue to play of Bond in future films.Skyfall is a complete masterclass in acting, directing, action sequences and cinematography. It's the perfect action and bond film, my favourite in the series and it's going to take a lot for future films to beat it. It's one of the few films that both old school and new school fans can love and appreciate.10/10 - A+ (Incredible)",10,3,6,30 December 2018
Catch Me If You Can," A Different Kind of Spielberg Film
","If I had no idea who directed this movie and I was told to guess Steven Spielberg would not been my first guess, but believe it or not that's a great thing, it shows that Spielberg is willing to change things up and try new things and this is definitely one of his better movies. This is a film that is extreme well written, entertaining and funny all in one I loved this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio was so good in this film he really sunk himself into this con man but through his performance you can tell that he isn't a bad person just a lost kid refusing to face reality which makes him a much more interesting character. Tom Hanks was also fantastic in this film not only is he really funny but he had great scenes with DiCaprio, you really got the impression that these two were each others equals and it was riveting to watch. Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances ever in this film I thought he had some really touching scenes with DiCaprio and he was a really tragic character. John Williams gives one of his best scores ever to this film, the theme is jazzy and alive and matches perfectly with the tone of the film. A lot of the entertainment value for this movie comes from seeing Abagnale change in and out of his different personas, not only does it create for a lot of laughs but it was really interesting to see how he was able to accomplish all his misdeeds. I do have a couple of flaws with this movies for one a lot of character arcs such as Amy Adams arc just do not get a real conclusion and are left dangling in the air. My other flaw may seem like a minor one or a nitpick but there were a lot of unbelievable aspects in this film namely scenes where DiCaprio makes clear and obvious mistakes and are just written of as funny scenes, which they are but I just think it took me out of the movie a bit. Another than one or two minor nitpick I think this is a fantastic film, one of Spielbergs better films for sure, it's got some great performances, a really different and catchy score from John Williams and a tone different from other Spielberg films that just continues to show me his incredible range as a director.91%/A",9,0,1,26 November 2016
Minority Report," Everybody Runs, To See This Film
","Steven Spielberg is one of the Definitive directors of our times he's done everything and has changed cinema more than once but out of all his films over all the decades that he's been a director Minority Report in my opinion is his greatest achievement and is my second favourite movie of all time. I love everything about this movie from its through provoking plot to its gorgeous world. The main story of this film seems all but to realistic you can't help but debate with yourself about the system they have in place is it the fight way to do things? Is there a better way? Questions like these are what make Minority Report more than just an average action thriller. The opening scene of this film is one of my favourite openings in any movie, it perfectly presents to us how things are done in this future and the effectiveness of this team. The world in this film is incredible but not blown out of proportion it feels like it could exist one day, the blown out whites that Spielberg out into this film made it feels like the future and never seemed distracting. Tom Cruise is so good in this film, I really liked his character he was not just a perfect police officer but a damaged one that added a layer of complexity to him, you understood perfectly why he was the way he was and you were able to sympathise with him all the way through. Max Von Snydow was fantastic in this movie not only did he have great chemistry with Cruise but he just had a presence to him when ever he was on screen and when he eventually shows his true colours you completely understand his motivations. That's another great thing about this movie everybody has a reason for the way they feels they all have their own views and opinions, nobodies a mindless drone in this film. The way this film approached the murder mystery was enthralling, it was built up perfectly to another one of my all time favourite movie moments the scene were Cruise confronts who he thinks killed his son, this scene truly proved how good an actor Cruise is you believe his rage but when he chooses not to kill him you feel so satisfied. In my opinion this is one of the only movies dealing with time manipulation that doesn't really have any plot holes to it, any hole you might see in this system is carefully countered through intelligent conversation between characters. The way this film ends between Cruise and Snydow is amazing, it's very physiological you really don't know what's going to happen and everything comes together perfectly for an intense ending that perfectly wraps up the physiological war between these two characters. Know I know the most common complaint about this film is its stereotypical happy ending but I really like it you get the sense that these two characters have had some closure and are ready to move on.Minority Report is a flawless movie it's intriguing and engaging, never boring its directed beautifully, has the greatest future since Blade Runner, has excellent performances and thought provoking arguments that ring true to real life and will forever be one of my favourite movies and a constant reminder of why I love cinema so much.100%/A+",10,1,1,17 November 2016
Wind River," Taylor Sheridan is Here To Stay
","As much as I like Sicario, I like it more for the direction and performances rather than the script, Hell or High Water on the other hand was so good mainly because of the screenplay so I was understandably very excited for Wind River and I was blown away by my second favourite movie of the year so far (falling only close behind Dunkirk) and I could not be more curious to see what Taylor Sheridan does next. Sheridan wrote and directed this movie wonderfully, at first it seems like an ordinary murder mystery but it quickly turns into a character based drama with something real tragedy behind it with some very good social commentary in regards to the way the law works in the poorer areas of America and the treatment of Native Americans which makes this film more intelligent and fascinating than it could have been. Sheridan also took to the directing of this film really well, it made you feel the atmosphere of the film as well as giving some true realism, an Oscar nomination for the writing or the directing would be well deserved. Sheridans script also happen to be very performances centric and this film is no different. Jeremy Renner gives the best performance of his career in this film, he's so subtle yet brilliant in his delivery, you get the sense that the character has been through some real turmoil and is in a lot of pain, it let you sympathise with his character more and he stole this movie for me. Elizabeth Olsen is also fantastic in this movie, real strong willed, professional yet quite inexperienced, she was really convincing as this character. I'm glad to see her get out of the marvel universe and give a more grounded performance like this. The location played a big part in this movie, it was almost a central character, like Sicario and Hell or High Water before it Wind River really makes you feel like it's main location is a grimy place, not one you would want to visit. It gave this film a real grit to it, nothing felt like a movie but about as close to real life as this film could be. Sheridan did a good job of making you feel cold while watching this movie, you hear the wind in the air and see the thick snow on screen, it makes you feel like you are there and that's one of the best praises I can give a movie. Despite all the social commentary this film is still a murder mystery at its heart and that mystery is very intriguing, it's a good guessing game like any solid mystery should be but the pay-off was fairly unsatisfactory. The film just kind of tells you the answer and was done in a fairly lazy way. Wind River is amazing, it's got a brilliant script with a good directing style to match, fantastic, career best performances from Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, a very good atmospheric location as well as a solid central mystery. Even if the answer to that mystery is given in a fairly lazy way I was far too impressed with everything that came before for that to bother me to much. I'm very excited to see what Taylor Sheridan does next and I truly think he's becoming a real talent to watch out for. 9.5/10: A (Phenomenal)",9,5,12,14 September 2017
Star Trek," The Definition of A Reboot That Really Works
",Now this is a familiar story but before i saw this movie I didn't give a crap about Star Trek as a whole my best friend guilt tripped me in or watching this movie on his birthday and was blown away by this incredible film and to this day is in my top 50 films of all time. Recasting cinematic legends for characters that they mastered was really no easy task but they they absolutely nailed it with Chris Pine nailing it as Captain Kirk giving him a more flawed and relatable portrayal than that of William Shatner. Zachary Quinto absolutely blew me away in this film with his performance to the point were I was hoping for a best actor nomination for him which obviously did not happen but doesn't make his performance any less fantastic. The rest of the cast was also great Scotty and Bones both being the films comic relief I though they were both hilariously funny in this film while still having a good heart to there characters. The late Anton Yelchin also blew me away in this movie he nails that new kid quality to Chekov making you feel right at home with him playing the character. The special effects are incredible in this film they make you feel the scale and power of the enterprise and the scale of the destruction during the space battle action scenes. Eric Bana to me is a really underrated actor he absolutely blew me away with his amazing performance in Munich and kills it here as Nero he just gets his characters damaged persona while still managing to make for a sinister portrayal. This movie had no easy task of rebooting the franchise but they did it in the best possible way allowing the event of the previous to shows and movies to happen but allowing these films to exist separately. In the end this movie is in Incredible it got me and many other fans into one of the greatest franchises of all time even if it's still got its haters. 100%-A+,10,1,3,27 August 2016
Memento," There's No Other Movie Like This
",Memento is a movie that is actually quite hard to review because it is so unique and different but I'm going to try to do it anyway. First of all this movie is perfectly directed by Christopher Nolan he adds such suspense and mystery to every shot and scene in this movie. The movie is one that intentionally played in reverse by starting of a scene in a certain situation and the next scene will take place before that explaining how he got into that situation it's works perfectly for Memento as it is a perfect way to put the viewer in Leonard situation and reflect how much his condition holds him back. Guy Pearce in my opinion is a good actor who can really do wonders when given the right script and wonders is exactly what he did here as this today remains his best and most complex performance because through his performance you are able to feel sorry for him while still being able to be untrustworthy. Carrie Ann Moss is also very good in this movie as like Leonard you don't know how to trust her and she is the polar opposite of Leonard selfish and manipulative. The screenplay in this move is one of the best ever written in my opinion as there's just no other movie like this and every scene has a new mystery to it. Memento is in my top 20 movies of all time at is really should just how good a written and director Christopher Nolan is continuing to keep up this standard over 15 years later. 100%-A+,10,0,3,10 June 2016
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantinos Masterpiece
","I adore Quentin Tarantino, he's a filmmaker like no other, the way is he able to create almost entirely dialogue driven films that have no down time or boredom is what makes him one of the best directors of all time and Inglorious Basterds is my favourite film of his and one of my favourites of all time. The plot of this movie is simple: 8 Jewish soldiers set out to kill every Nazi in sight. It's simple and it's impossible not to get behind the deaths of some of histories evil human beings. But there's just one Problem, Christoph Waltz is the way of them killing he entire Mazi command and Waltz gives an absolutely Incredible performance which ranks up in the greatest performances of all time. Theirs not a single scene where he's not intriguing or down right terrifying. Brad Pitt also gives one of his greatest performances here not only is he really funny and an entertaining character buts he also really unpredictable and really cruel which just make him an overall better character. This movie contain some of the best building tension ever put to screen for example the scene in the bar that just has you on the edge of your seat and still manages to leave you startled when everyone starts shooting and again it's all through dialogue. This is not a war movie it's a Tarantino movie it's not trying to be a historical movie it's trying to be a tension filled Masterpiece and the proof of this comes from the films ending. Not only is the movie within the movie incredibly well executed but the events surrounding the final assassination of Hitler and the high command all comes together perfectly it's feels earned and I really admired Tarantinos choice to change history. It's give the film as a whole a more satisfying conclusion. If your looking for a war movie this is not for you but if your looking for a movie with incredible performances and tension filled sequences then this is for you and is in my opinion Tarantinos greatest achievement.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Fun At Times But Flawed and Unnecessary
","I was really excited for Rogue One, I was fully aware that this movie was not necessarily needed but I wasn't to concerned about that as long as it was entertaining and had good characters and only to a certain extent did they succeed. This is not a bad film but it's just not all that great and will not stand as one of the better Star Wars films. But there was plenty of good in this film for one it looks incredible, Gareth Edward did a fantastic job at blending special effects with real life and was seamless, he is also a master at showing scale and making his films seem gritty and real. This is a war film and it made the world seem more grounded in reality. The performances were pretty good, Felecity Jones was really good and had a nice arc to her, Diego Luna was also really good and was an entertaining character, I haven't seen much of Donnie Yen but he really impressed me in this film and his character was a nice way of showing how the fall of the Jedi effected more than just the Jedi themselves. But easily this films greatest performance was Mads Mikkelson, he's one of my favourite actors and he was just perfect in this film as a father and as a man faced with an impossible situation. The last act of this film is easily its best it's directed amazingly you are invested in the plan and is easily the best thing about this film. But for every positive in this film there is a negative and this film has plenty. For one the character for the most part remained undeveloped, other than Jyn Erso not enough backstory and motivations are provided. I love Forrest Whitaker but he was so bad in this movie, his voice and mannerisms were completely over the top and was not a necessary character. Like I said I loved the last act of this movie but the first two were dull, slow and uninteresting for the most part. Obviously one of the things people are most looking forward to in this film is Darth Vader and he is a fantastic presence when he was in the film and I truly think that he could have been used more as the scenes he was in he added nothing to the plot other than fan service. Star Wars has a bit of a tradition of adding comic relief through droids and this film follows that tend but fails at it, K2SO was funny at first but after a while became really annoying and his humour was really forced.I loved The Force Awakens and I was hoping that this film would tide me over until Episode 8 next year but it really hasn't, its an entertaining enough movie but far from one I'm going to be dying to watch again soon, if your a Star Wars fan you can at least appreciate it but it fails to live up to other entries in the franchise and doesn't give me a lot of hope for future anthology films. 66%/B-",6,18,37,15 December 2016
Shaun of the Dead," Dawn of The Shaun
","For Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's first film collaboration they took a simple story that they could get every bit of comedy gold out of. While it's definitely my least favourite of their work it was still the perfect note to start their trilogy on.Theirs no way around it: the casting and performances in this film are pitch perfect. It's clear every part in this film was written specifically for the actors who played them. Pegg and Frost obviously have perfect comedy timing but they pulled of just as many dramatic scenes as well. All the supporting actors made the roles their own and played of the two leads well.The directing in this film is vibrant and alive. Like all of Wright's film, it feels like I could watch this film for days on end and still discover new hidden details and references he put in the film for viewers to discover. The comedy in this film is some of the most inventive I've ever seen. Theirs so many examples of visual comedy as their are in the script.The romance in this film really didn't do a lot for me. It was by far the most generic and cliche element of the film and I was far more invested in Pegg and Frosts friendship than I was in Pegg trying to win back his girlfriend. As much as I love watching this film I don't consider it much more than a very clever comedy but for Wright's feature debut I couldn't have asked for anything else.I really do love this film. It's endlessly hilarious and visually inventive, the characters are likeable and it's absolutely a film I could watch at any time and still enjoy it every time.8.7/10 - A- (Fantastic)",8,0,0,6 January 2019
Argo," Argo and Watch It Now
","Ben Affleck has proved himself to be both a brilliant actor and an amazing director and both of these are very clearly on display with Argo, one of my favourite films to win The Academy Award for Best Picture. One of the greatest reasons for this is the fact that it brilliantly mixes both entertainment value and nail baiting intensity. The first half of this movie is just incredibly entertaining and really interesting its reminiscent of a heist a heist film and it paints an interesting look at the Hollywood film industry and slowly builds the anticipation for the overall rescue without every seeming likes its just killing time until then. Once we get to the actual operation the film just completely switches tone but not in a bad way or an out of place way it helps to point out the real dander of what Afflecks character is trying to accomplish while showing the overwhelming odds against him and the hostages. There's not a single second where you are bored or invested or on edge every time a character looks over their shoulder or checks their watch you feel the exact same way they do. That's all because of the characters you learn just enough about them to make them feel like real life human beings. The performances in this movie are all top notch Affleck is just right he never overacts but is never bland and just comes across as genuine. But they real scene stealers in this film where Alan Arkin and John Goodman they were both absolutely hilarious in the film their lines and catchy and quick even when they say something that would seem to be stupid or false you believe them because of the way they come across and it's not all laughs and giggles with them when they are desperately waiting for any news on the operation you get a real feeling of concern from them and makes them all the more likable. The only real flaw I have with this film is the fact that it could've put more effort into telling the story of the other hostages that didn't get away and we're spending everyday with a gun to their head, we get a few quick scenes of them being threatened but it wasn't really enough and other than a little credit at the end theirs not real conclusion to their story.Overall, I love Argo its entertaining, hilarious and riveting at all right times and I just don't understand the controversy for this movie, I will keep saying it you can't judge a film by the story or characters it based on you have to judge it as a film and this is a damn good one.A/95%",9,0,2,15 October 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," The Greatest of The Star Trek Franchise
",Star Trek is one of the most beloved franchises of all time yet the rebooted trilogy are easily the series most divisive instalments. But this film and the 2009 original made me the Star Trek fan that I am today and this is in my (unpopular) opinion the franchises greatest instalment. The new cast of these films fit right into there roles and I could not imagine better replacements for some of the best cast characters of all time. Chris Pine really impressed me in this film he's still very entertaining and funny but he's also really good at portraying the rage filled Kirk that begins to emerge throughout this film and is a great arc for the character that would continue to be explored in Beyond. Zachary Quinto is also fantastic he once again is amazing at conveying the inner struggles that take place in his character and when he fails to keep that hold it allows Quinto to really show is acting chops. The relationship trouble between Spock and Uhura is not some meaningless sub plot it's a fantastic way to show the progression of these characters and how their continued service and past experiences have begun to effect and change them. But my God Benedict Cumberbatch was absolutely phenomenal as the Villain in this film not only is he incredibly menacing and physically imposing but also very heartfelt when you begin to more understand his motivations. He's also got some Incrediblely terrifying scenes where you legitimately start to fear for the life of the crew because you believe that he poses a real threat to them. The special effects are of course fantastic there seamless and look nothing less than amazing. Now I know that the biggest and most common complaint about this film are the comparisons to Wrath of Khan but honestly I think it worked for this film it allows the characters to be pushed to the edge of their abilities like the cast were in WOK and it gives us another chance at seeing one of the most beloved sci-fi villains of all time played by an amazing actor. The way they set up the five year mission was perfect it feels like the cast at this point have earned it and leaves you excited to see what they'll do next. I think Star Trek Into Darkness has developed a lot of unwarranted hate I thinks it's a masterful edition to the franchise that I will always love. A+/100%,10,1,8,27 October 2016
Us," All of 'Us'
",With 'Get Out' Jordan Peele cemented himself as an interesting new director to watch out for and its a movie I've loved the more I've watched it. There was no reason for me not to be excited for 'Us' and while it was very different from what I was expecting it was still an immensely rewarding experience that I cannot wait to see again.Peele's writing and directing were both top notch in this film. In Get Out it was more about his script but here he proves himself to be just as good behind the camera. There's a constant sense of tension and unease in his directing. He does many things visually that set up things that viewers can enjoy after repeat viewings.With basically every actor portraying 2 characters in this film is almost entirely reliant on its actors to carry the film. Luckily Peele brought out the best in all of them with Lupita Nyong'o owning the film in every scene she's in no matter which characters she's playing. Winston Duke and the actors portraying the children are also all excellent in the film even if they're not given as much as Nyong'o to do.It's also a very intelligent movie that sets up a great sense of mystery. The audience is kept in the dark for so much of the film and it slows the viewers to make their own theories and predictions as the film goes on. It's a great sense of fun in trying to predict what will happen but I wouldn't blame anyone for simply waiting for answers. Even if there is a bit of an exposition dump towards the end that I found tacked on there still plenty left up to interpretation.My only other real issue with the film was a two sequence at the beginning of the end Act. Both two scenes that work well on their own but are placed next to each other and with them both being fairly similar it feels repetitive and halts the pacing somewhat.Us is a movie that anyone can watch and still take something away from it. It's a highly original movie that rewards the viewer on their first viewing and many more after that. The powerhouse performance from Lupita Nyong'o carry's so much of the film but Peele's writing and directing is the true star of the film. It's one the best films of the year and is likely to stay that way.9.3/10 (Phenomenal),9,0,7,9 May 2019
Knives Out," A Whodunit Like No One Has Dunnit Before
","Apparently an unpopular these days but I adore Rian Johnson as a director, I've yet to see all his work but of what I've seen he's never made a film that I have not loved. Because of that Knives Out was one of my most anticipated movies of 2019 and more than that there was never a moment of doubt during the build up to seeing this film where I thought it would disappoint me. As I'd hoped this movie lived up to my expectations as well subverting them in all the right ways.Like the classic murder mystery's that inspired it, Knives Out has an incredible cast without a single weak link within it. Daniel Craig gives a Performance like he never has before and loved what he did here. I got used to the accent he used and loved the eccentricity he brought. Ana De Armas has really come Into her own over the last few years and this is the best I've ever seen her, she's a star in the making and this film just proves it even more. Chris Evans, Jaime Lee Curtis And Michael Shannon all give performances against their usual type and loved all of them here, as despicable as their characters were they were still so engaging to watch thanks to the writing and their performances.Despite the cast, Rian Johnson is the real star of this film. His blend of drama and humour worked perfectly. Despite the amount of brilliant comedy it never took away from the mystery aspects or the tension. His writing was subversive of the usual ways in which we expect a mystery to be portrayed and left me wondering where exactly the movie was going in the best possible way. This really keeps the movie original and fresh which definitely made for a unique experience of watching this movie for the first time. My only issue with his script was the overload of exposition, there obviously has to be a lot in a complex mystery like this but the expository scenes feel overlong and drawn out at many points.Knives Out is endlessly rewarding, intelligently written and so much fun as a movie. While Rian Johnson may be the true star, the entire cast is incredible with many of them giving performances against their usual type and succeed at it wonderfully. It's full of humour while still maintaining a great deal of character and tension. I can't waiting to see what Johnson does next whether it's another entry in this world or something else that is completely original.9.5/10 - A (Phenomenal)",9,0,6,12 January 2020
127 Hours," A Rock and A Hard Place
","With Danny Boyle being such a unique film maker it's a given that he will take a lot of risks in his careers and '127 Hours' is definitely one of them. Having a film mostly set in the same location, with one character can be tricky but Boyle and James Franco pulled it off fantastically. Danny Boyle made this film as engaging as it is, the way he directed this movie ensured that you knew exactly how desperate this situation was, he used a lot of footage from the camcorder, a lot of fast edits to show Ralstons deteriorating mental health Anne he also didn't leave the location of the canyon that often, it made you feel as if you were in this location with this one character and helped you better buy into his situation. I've always really liked James Franco, both in his comedy roles and more serious dramatic works he's consistently surprised me with his range but nothing more than his work in this movie with his amazing performance. Not only does he make him instantly likable and engaging with his natural charm but when things start to get more desperate Franco nails the more emotionally intense scenes that help you sympathise with the character a lot more than any of the flashbacks. This film didn't pull any punches, the eventual scene where Ralston has to cut of his arm is breathtakingly realistic, the sound effects, Franco's performance and excellent prosthetics come together to make you believe that what is happening on screen is as close to what it must have been like in real life. It also doesn't hold back on the more emotionally devastating moments where Ralston confesses to his failings and short comings that help you to realise what someone will do or say when they are as close to death as this man was. My only real issue with this movie is the rather on the nose flashbacks, I'm not saying that I objected to learning more about Ralston as a person, I just think that seeing anyone in this horrific situation is enough to get the viewer to sympathise with him. A lot of them did add something to his character but a lot didn't really do anything for me. While I'm not going to rush back to watch this film, as a viewing experience this is a film that any major film fan should watch at some point. Thanks to Franco's amazing work, Boyles masterful direction and excellent use of the premises gritty tone this is something that I believe will stay with anyone who watches it. 8.6/10: A- (Fantastic)",8,0,1,7 September 2017
Spotlight," A Powerfully Real Film
","At the end of this film a list of all the similar cases as explored in this film come up on screen and I was shocked to see so many places near my home town come up. But that's the best thing about this film the fact that it stays with you, all the disturbing things you see or hear off in this film leaves an impression on its viewer that makes you realise the importance of the story these journalists are trying to tell. The Spotlight team themselves are very well realised, there not put on a pedestal as heroes but instead as people trying to tell a story and there subtle reactions to the horrors they are investigating fell real not just like it was done to add to the horrors. This film is an ensemble piece there's no one main character in this film but instead they all bounce of each other and work together well as a unit and there is not a bad performance in sight. Mark Ruffalo is proving to me more and more that he is becoming one of today's best actors, he has such a great character arc to him and when his scene where he explodes with anger feels very well earned. Rachel McAdams was also very good in this film, she had some truly hard to watch scenes where she interviews some of the victims and she keeps her vulnerability yet cool head at all times that make her a more believable character. Up until the year before with Birdman, Michael Keaton has never really impressed me outside of his Batman movies but here he was fantastic, very convincing as are the rest of the cast, through his performance we understand that's he more experienced in this field than most. Tom McCarthy directed this film beautifully, he has a very specific style about him where he keeps the camera in the same position for long periods of time and direction like this in my experience usually makes the film bland, but because of the brilliant performances and story I was never anything less than intrigued, the best shot in this film though was a long tracking shot that followed the reporters down the street to discover one of the people they are investigating lives nearby and it added a more personal touch to the main characters. But my biggest and really only issue with this movie is it conclusion, the film just ends so abruptly and I wanted to see more of the after effects of such a story. Spotlight is a brilliant movie, it's not always easy to watch but it's got a very gripping and powerful story behind it and has got amazing performances and will relate to more people than anyone would care to admit. 92%/A",9,0,0,8 December 2016
Insomnia," A Solid Yet Conventional Thriller
","Christopher Nolans filmography in his short career is very varied and different he's done Sci Fi, superheros and Phycological thrillers yet this film seems much more straightforward than his other films while it's easily his worst film under Nolans hand it's solidly entertaining with some truly fantastic performances. The best thing about this film is how atmospheric it is, the touch of having the town in constant daylight reflected Pacinos inability to sleep and set this location out as different. Al Pacino gives one of his better performances in this film he's completely convincing in his gradual decline through his lack of sleep and brought a conflicted nature to his character. Robin Williams also gives one of his best performances in this film because he is so creepy and unstable in this film so he's always entertaining and engaging to watch. I will say this for the film it did do a good job at being engaging, the mystery was pretty interesting, even though we get the reveal of the murderer fairly quickly the battle between Pacino and Williams was always engaging. This film succeeds at being entertainment in its action sequences, there extremely gritty and life like. However this film does have flaws that stem mostly from the script, for one it's a fairly standard murder mystery at its core, had it not included the insomnia plot thread nothing about this film would have been truly unique. However probably my biggest issue with this film is the decisions made by Al Pacino character, we get all this build up towards him being an honest cop but after his one mistake, though fairly large, he seems to just flip 180 into a completely different person who comes across as corrupt and is in complete contradiction of itself. A fairly interesting sub plot of Williams blackmailing Pacino looked like it could be fantastic but is barely focused upon and quickly grazed over and is ultimately dropped. I know this is a fairly short review but there just not that much to talk about in this film, it's got two very good lead performances, Nolan directs to action brilliantly, it's an atmospheric film and one that is at least entertaining. The script however lets this film down with its clichés, contradictions and dropped sub plots. It's not a bad film but far from Nolans finest work. 75%/B",7,0,0,14 January 2017
Zodiac," An Ambitious Serial Killer Movie Like No Other
","David Fincher has truly proved to be a master and physiological thrillers and serial killer stories but before I watched this movie I was sceptical if it could work, because it spans so many years and different stories so it would be hard to bring this all together for a cohesive narrative. Another thing I was worried about was if this movie as a whole would be satisfying as the real Zodiac killer was never caught so I was wondering if it would really be a story worth telling. But it truly was this movie is fantastic and is truly one of Fincher best efforts. This movie does jump in time a lot but it's done in away so that you see the long lasting effects on the characters without ever feeling bored. Jake Gyllenhall is incredible in this movie he perfectly conveys his characters child like innocence and the toll that his obsessive investigation into the Zodiac has on him and in my opinion was snubbed an Oscar for this movie. Robert Downey Jr also really blew me away in this movie he's really able to come across as an arrogant character at first and then turns into a sympathetic and damaged one once you realise just how much the Zodiac has cost him. The investigation is always compelling your always engaged by it and are desperate to see the case solved so that the characters can feel some piece of mind. The final scene between Graysmith and Allan is truly incredible had this scene not been included I don't know if this movie would have been as satisfying it just makes you feel some piece for Graysmith and further proves how incredible Gyllenhall is. My biggest and really only problem with this movie is the fact that the last act wasn't nearly as interesting you start to feel the run time and needed to include the other supporting characters more. Zodiac is a great film despite its disappointing last act it's got amazing performances a compelling mystery and a surprisingly satisfying pay off. 87%-A-",8,0,0,21 October 2016
The Prestige," An Incredible and Magical Experience
","The first time I watched Christopher Nolans 'The Prestige' I didn't really know what to think I watched it in the wrong circumstances, I was on a plane and couldn't really take it in properly, so my first advice when watching this film is make sure that your watching it so that you can pay attention because if you love a good and mind bending mystery then you will love this movie just as much as I did because The Prestige is one of my all time favourite movies. The initial rivalry and physiological warfare that goes on between Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman is a really effective plot device because you know how much it means to both of them to be the best there motivations are very understandable and the tole that it takes on them is truly intriguing to watch unfold. I adored watching the mechanics of the magic tricks it makes you realise how simple it is while never ruining the magic for you. The setting of 19th century is just a marvel to watch the production design is seamless and you can clearly tell that a lot off effort went in to it. To date I think this is Hugh Jackman finest performance it really showed his acting range from a happy yet naive magician to a haunting and damaged character. Christian Bale is also really good in this film he feels natural and it's truly disturbing to watch his life fall apart in conjunction with Hugh Jackman's. Scarlett Johansson also gives the greatest performance of her career in this film she's perfect at portraying the one thing these two characters still have in common. David Bowie was fantastic in this movie he's really mysterious yet somewhat wise and or definitely one of the best performances ever given by a musician. Christopher Nolan directed this movie beautifully everything from the editing, to the stage illusions to the little moments that set up for the final twist are all done perfectly and it do date amazes me The the academy continue to snub him. The final twist in the movie is just perfect it feels believable thanks to Nolans direction but is anything but predictable. The Prestige is a masterpiece I have not one flaw with this movie it's got amazing performances, direction and locations it's one of my favourite Nolan movies by far. A+/100%",10,0,2,5 November 2016
The Hateful Eight," An Amazing Mix of an Intriguing Mystery, Stylish Violence and Engaging Dialogue
",Quentin Tarantino is not only considered to be one of the greatest directors working today but one of the best of all time and The Hateful Eight is just further evidence of this as its one of his finest efforts. One of the reasons for this is its central mystery because who can't get behind a good mystery and with Tarantinos Dialogue your just constantly engaged and intrigued by what happens next and makes you want to go back and watch it again to see it in a different light and perspective. To have an an engaging mystery you need intriguing characters and they all are because they're all just so different it makes their interactions fascinating. We have Kurt Russell in one of his greatest performances making for a very charismatic and likable lead you get the impression that he has a very strong moral code and helps you get behind him more and want him to survive the night. Samuel L Jackson gives the greatest performance he's ever given since Pulp Fiction he's just perfect as Major Warren he's entertaining and mysterious and that's another great thing about this movie your never 100% sure on any of the characters even after the credits start rolling you don't know if any thing they said during the entire run time was the truth. Before this film I hadn't seen much of Jennifer Jason Leigh but she blew me away in this movie she was just so despicable and disgusting and it takes a special kind of actress to pull it off as well as she did. The location of the log cabin in this movie was perfectly utilised you feel like your their with the characters feeling as cold as they are. Under the wrong direction this movie could have been so boring because this movie is mostly dialogue very little action so Tarantino directs this movie wonderfully never making you feel bored or any less than invested. Visually I would say that this is Tarantinos best movie the cinematography in this movie is incredible This snowy landscapes look amazing and suck you into the world they are building. Unfortunately the one thing that stopped this movie from being perfect was the last 20 minutes with giving away to much it just fails to keep the intrigue and suspense of the rest of the film. The Hateful Eight was one of my favourite movies of 2015 and if one of my favourite Tarantino Movies and for me it holds the title of being Tarantinos most addictive movie.A/97%,9,1,3,15 October 2016
Crash," Flawed But Admirably Ambitious
","Crash is a solid movie for me, it's not amazing but I do think that it's got very good intentions and found the story to be very interesting and while I do agree that it shouldn't have won Best Picture that doesn't make it a bad film. One thing that nobody can deny about this film are the excellent performances by its entire cast with Michael Pena, Terrence Howard and Matt Dillon being the standouts. Pena gives a fragile and heartwarming performance here I loved his scenes with his daughter and you truly feel for him with the racism he has to deal with. On the opposite end of the spectrum Matt Dillon completely falls into his hostile and racist character but the best thing about his character was the fact that you understand why he is the way he is the fact that he has not got the right but the right reasons for his feelings and quickly turned from a hate able character into an intriguing and sympathetic one. Terrence Howard plays a perfect coward he's become used to the casual racism and discrimination that he has to put up with on a daily basis and watching him let it all happen while he wanted to do something was truly tear jerking especially in the scene with his wife. Technically this movie is fantastic Paul Haggis did an excellent job directing this film he panned along very nicely and he's back enough to left the actors to perform on their own without ever getting in their way with needles cuts and movements. This film won an Oscar for its editing and its very well deserved they knew when to cut at just the right time and managed to keep the film very well balanced. However this film is far from perfect for one, it lacks subtly instead of allowing the actors to just emote through their performances the writers felt the need to have them go on with big monologues or outbursts. When certain characters snap it just didn't feel earned while you certainly understand some frustration or anger it just seems as if they've lost the will to live and it just feels so out of place. An I found the ending of this movie to not really fit with the rest of the film it feels to much like a sitcom from the 90s. However I thought they did do a good job at closing out all of the character arcs in a satisfying way. Crash is not perfect it's got some narrative issues and some over the top moments and it. Certainly should not have one best picture against Munich (one of my favourite movies). But it has fantastic performances and a great message that I could really get behind. 78%/B+",7,2,4,1 November 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider Man Comes Home
","Being completely honest, I wasn't really sold on Spider Man Homecoming on the lead up to its release, I was always an advocate for Andrew Garfield and his interpretation of the character and thought his series came to a premature end. Beyond that the trailers weren't really grabbing me and I wasn't too sure if Tom Holland could carry an entire movie for me, but while I wasn't floored I was pleasantly surprised by what I got. Tom Holland is really coming into his own as this character, he's still my least favourite out of the three live action adaptions but he brought a real humanity to this role, you got the sense that he really was inexperienced yet excited to be this hero and you bought his performance all the way through. I really liked Robert Downey Jr in this movie, his character was a lot more mature in this film in his mentor role to Peter but he never lost that entertainment value that makes people love him. Happy Hogan was also a welcome addition that had great chemistry with Holland. One positive I have for this film is something I haven't had for many other MCU films; the villain. I actually loved the Vulture in this film, not only was Michael Keaton fantastic in this movie as him but the character himself was just very well written, he had excellent motivation that I could understand, you never got the sense that he was a naturally bad man but instead a good guy who wasn't in a bad situation and didn't come out of it for the better. I also loved how they handled Spider-Man himself in this movie, we've never really seen him in high school in any of his other films so it was a good decision to put him in that situation. In every film the character always struggled with balancing Peter Parker and Spider Man but it was done in a more relatable way. It was great to see him in his infancy as a superhero, a lot of humour directed at his inexperience and his need to prove himself, despite all the cgi and superpowers it felt like a more grounded and more realistic addition to this franchise. It's great to see Marvel give smaller directors chances and Jon Watts really took to the task, a lot of the directing in the high school scenes felt really old fashioned and really well edited but he does a really good job with the action scenes, again he adds something if a realism to them that makes you feel Peters vulnerability. As much as I enjoyed this film it isn't perfect, the pacing in this film wasn't the best. Homecoming cuts back and forth between Peter and Spider-Man and him at high school and the divide isn't done very well, just when the film starts to get quicker with him as Spider-Man he'll go back to high school for a while and the pacing gets a lot slower and this is repeated about 3 or 4 times throughout the run time and did kill the momentum a bit. While I loved the main villain of the Vulture the supporting antagonists weren't handled very well, they just feel like disposable characters with no result purpose other than to just add more comic characters to this film. The film wouldn't really have been any different had they not been in here which is a shame because there could have been a lot more done with them. While it's not quite my favourite of the franchise, it was nothing if not a pleasant surprise. The tone was perfect, it has something of a realism to it, Holland and Keaton are both excellent in this film and we finally have another strong MCU villain. While the pacing isn't the best and some of the supporting villains could have been handled better, while I was very sceptical about a new version of this character I was glad to be proved wrong. 8.4/10: A- (Fantastic)",8,2,7,24 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Greatest and Most Undervalued Star Wars Film
","Despite the original Star Wars trilogy being considered one of the greatest trilogies of all time it's final instalment Return of The Jedi is only considered to be good and I have to say that not only do I think this movie is on par with the past two entries, I actually think this is better than them. A large part of why I love this movie so much is how satisfying it is, the entire trilogy has built up to the events in this film, so we're completely invested in the characters and situation, it all came together perfectly. All the characters in this film are different than they were in the last two films and if adds to there characters to see that there are still consequences to every action they take. I thought that The Emperor was a fantastic villain for this film as we truly realise just how powerful he is and it was interesting to see how he controlled Vader. The physiological and physical war that goes on between Luke and Darth Vader is done perfectly, now only is is incredibly intense but it's also very Eye opening to see a more personal fight for Vader and we understand just how much the emperor has taken from him. The final three way battle against the empire and the Death Star is done just right because we understand just how much the characters need to rely on each other to succeed, all the arcs feed into each other and I found it to be extremely well done. Now I wanted to address in this review some of the most common complaints with this film and why I disagree with them, for one I thought it was an interesting idea to bring in a second Death Star because it created a new sense of urgency as we know from the get go in this film, the power that it possesses and I thought the way they destroy it in this film was better executed than in the original. While most people were willing to understand that complaint, the Ewoks are extremely hated upon when talking about this film but I really liked the idea of them and found it somewhat inspiring that they went up against the empire. The most powerful scene in this film is that of Vader funeral it was an extremely personal scene and thought that ten silence of Luke staring at his fathers bodies was extremely heartfelt and was a satisfying conclusion to the arc they have built across the series. I really do think that this film was the best Star Wars films, it's got all the characters back in satisfying and well done ways, all the character arcs all come to a close nicely and the final scene of this film was just a perfect way to wrap up the trilogy and will always make this one of my favourite movies of all time and one of my favourite sequels of all time. 100%/A+",10,6,10,16 December 2016
Alien," Definitive Sci Fi Brilliance
","When speaking about the greatest science fiction movies of all time Ridley Scott's Alien is a film that will come up in conversation and its very much deserving of such praise as this is a fantastically executed and atmospheric film that I truly found to be brilliant. For one this film looks fantastic, the interior design of the Nostromo is designed perfectly its not flashy or unbelievable but a realistic version of a space craft. The special effects are also perfect most likely (similarly to George Lucas with Star Wars) chose not to rely on them to much but instead use them sparingly using real life models to make it seem more realistic. The design of the titular Alien is also perfect, the design makes it look terrifying and imposing. The tension in this film is done perfectly due to Ridley Scott's masterful direction of this film made he made it very claustrophobic through long takes and wide shots that revealed to us just how little space there was for the characters to run. Also like the special effects he used the Alien itself sparingly we only really so it up close a few times which puts the viewer more in the shoes of the characters and makes the film all the more unpredictable. Another thing this will did very well was get out a truly fantastic central performance from Sigourney Weaver who is just cast to perfection in this film she's a strong and intelligent lead that is extremely likable and was the perfect conduit for the audience to experience the horror. There is never a moment from the first act on wards where the viewer feels completely safe and it made this film much more enjoyable. When such a menacing force such as the Alien in this film is built up its hard to make its eventual demise satisfying but this film did it, it was built up perfectly to the point where it seemed unlikely that the protagonists would succeed. However my biggest issue with the film is it's first act as while the slow pace worked for the second and third act in the beginning it did bore me and didn't grab my attention like the rest of the film did. Alien is a fantastic film things done in this film have been repeated in countless other Sci Fi films to this date, it's got one of the most effective uses if atmosphere ever in a film, I loved the central character and there was never a point past the third act where I felt completely safe. The only real problem with the film was the beginning of the first act but beyond that this film has no other flaw. 87%/A-",8,1,2,5 January 2017
The Town," One of my all time favourite movies
",Ben 'The Batman' Affleck directs The Town an amazing movie with a really great plot and themes where Affleck is amazing both in front of and behind the camera as I think he gives an Oscar worthy performance here as Doug McRay a man who just doesn't know where he belongs in life and that struggle is what carries this movie as here it's not about the heist it's about the characters. Jeremy Renner received an Oscar nomination for this movie and it's very well deserved he's fantastic in this movie just excelling at being incredibly intense and even frightening at times. The film isn't all drama though this is first and foremost a bank robbery movie and those bank robberies are filmed very well as there really fast paced making them feel real. The chemistry between Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall is perfect as its really believable you feel like these are real people in a real relationship. The Town is amazing extremely entertaining and in a lot of ways relatable it's one of the best bank robbery movies of all time with amazing performances proving that Ben Affleck is just as good a director as he is an actor.

Shutter Island," A Movie That Has To Be Watched Multiple Times
",It's always a delight to see directors have a variety of genres in their careers that's one of the reasons a love Shutter Island so much it's something completely different from Scorsese. The editing and directing in this movie is fantastic Scorsese keeps the suspense and tension he was able to achieve with The Departed and uses it even better here adding a lot of mystery leaving the viewer guessing to the very last second. This became apparent in the dream sequences as they could have come across as pretentious and melodramatic but they fit in perfectly.This is definitely a movie that's best experienced knowing as little as possible because this first and foremost is an investigation movie and you want to be able to experience that investigation with the characters. Leonardo DiCaprio returns for his fourth collaboration with Martin Scorsese and he is fantastic in this movie not only is he a character the audience can get behind he is also very complex and makes sure DiCaprio can give it everything. Mark Ruffalo was also very good in this movie he was likable and subtle. Ben Kingsley isn't in the movie much but he definitely makes the most of that screen time. This was one of the best movies of 2010 and Scorsese' most underrated movie. 96% from me would absolutely recommend this movie.,9,1,2,9 June 2016
Doctor Strange," The Doctor Will See You Now
","I love the MCU not since Phase One have I disliked a single movie that they've produced and Doctor Strange is one of their finest. Now I love the Captain America and Thor franchises but I've always liked seeing them introducing new characters into the mix and this is with a doubt their most ambitious movie since The Avengers. This movie is truly different from anything else we've seen in this universe and I loved that about this movie. The magic in this movie truly brought something new it made for some incredible, jaw- dropping visuals that convinced you of the power of these people. Benedict Cumberbatch was perfect for this role not only does he have a (surprisingly) convincing American accent but he's also able to bring his charm and wit to the role that makes him a much more human protagonist. Rachel McAdams was really good in this movie she's in it just the right amount and had some really great chemistry with Cumberbatch that made it all the more sad to see him fall apart. Chiwetel Ejiofor has truly become one of my favourite actors he was great in this film and I liked that they took their time set him up in this movie and I truly cannot wait to see him again. Tilda Swinton proved all the haters wrong in this movie she was great and coming across as wise and intelligent and hit just the right note of intrigue. By far the most common complaint among Marvel movies are the villains but I really think they nailed it here with Mads Mikkelsons character. Not only did I love the design of the character but also his motivations were somewhat understandable and in a way you can see where he's coming from. The magic in this movie is truly amazing they use it in practical ways that further proves that Marvel can take anything from their comics and make it work on screen. The movie does suffer from its conventional telling of an origin story and makes you realise that we've seen the structure before which is a shame considering the great lengths they took to establish a different kind of world with this movie. I found Doctor Strange to have terrific performances, characters, villain and have a good heart to it. This defiantly leaves me wanting more from this stranger side of the Marvel Universe. 91%/A",9,3,8,7 November 2016
Interstellar," Not Nolans Best but Still One Hell of A Film
","Despite the fact that I adore Christopher Nolan I just wasn't a huge fan of the trailers as I don't really like realistic space movies but this and 2015s The Martian have turned me as I though this was a fantastic movie even if it doesn't quite live up against Nolans other movies. I will be honest though the first time I watched it I wasn't a huge fan but this is definitely a movie that gets better and better with repeat viewings. But Nolans fingerprints are all over this it has an incredibly intriguing plot that is fully explored that was one if my worries watching this movie that it wasn't going to realise it's full potential but it did and made Interstellar very intriguing and smart. This film is directed beautifully there's no need for constant cuts and movement sometimes you just need to let the actors act and that's exactly what Nolan did. The space sequences in this movie are incredibly the special effects are perfect to the point where it looks and feels real. I loved the way the other planets were designed not only is it incredible to look at but there feel like real places that could exist out there somewhere. Christopher Nolan always inspire fantastic performances from his actors (look no further than Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight) and Interstellar is no different as there is not a single bad performance in the movie but ultimately its Matthew McConaughey who steals the entire movie in an Oscar Worthy performance. The actress who play young Murph Mackenzie Foy is also fantastic here and stays on par with Jessica Chastian who plays Older Murph. Say whatever you like about Anne Hathaway but I really like her as an actress as she gives one of her best performances here. But unfortunately the great performances in the movie can not save Interstellar from its biggest issue, the characters. There's just so many of them and other than McConaughey you don't really care about any of them I couldn't even name the other members of the crew and characters like Michael Caine and Casey Affleck just don't seem important enough. Without spooling anything I will say that there was an incredible sequence in this movie that was spectacular to look at but ultimately merely felt like a means to advance the plot forward and came across as to easy. This is the longest of all the Christopher Nolan Movies and it shows because Interstellar is far to long I think they could have easily cut a good 30 minutes out it. Overall though I really to like Interstellar the performance, direction and set pieces are all fantastic even if it has some problems with its characterisation and script. 86%-A-",8,0,2,24 June 2016
Full Metal Jacket," An Amazing First Act Ruined By The Rest of The Film
","Stanley Kubricks, Full Metal Jacket is widely considered to be one of the definitive war films, yet when I heard about it all I ever heard about was about the first act which is a new platoon of soldiers being trained by a cruel drill instructor so I was really wondering if the film was only focused on the training of the troops. It doesn't and that we're this film truly lost it for me. But I do think this film has plenty of positives, as I said the half of this movie is truly amazing it's intense and has an amazing performance for R Lee Emery I thought he was so convincing as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman he was hilarious and imposing and is by far the greatest thing about this movie. An extremely young Vincent D'Nofrio is in this movie and he was also amazing in this film, he was such a sympathetic character and even when he starts improving you still feel for him because you know just how much this training process has taken from him. I'm pretty sure it goes without saying that Stanley Kubrick directed this film to perfection, he always he something visually interesting happening on screen and their was never a dull moment for that first half. My praise pretty much stops there I think the last half of this film was dull, boring and tensionless. A big part of that was due to the completely boring protagonist, he never leaves any impression on the viewer and has absolutely no character development or arc. Honestly other than D'Nofrio nobody has any kind of character development and it really shows in the action sequences were there is absolutely no tension whatsoever because every character is interchangeable. The first half of this movie was incredibly intense because we saw the effects it had in the characters, the last half doesn't take the time to do this they just go on as if nothing's happened. The Vietnam arc of this film is simply just boring because it's pretty much just the same shots repeated for the last hour, Private Joker standing around talking to someone while other soldiers fight in the background. I wanted to love this movie, I really did but I couldn't, it's got far to many flaws when it comes to its characters and how it handles the arc in Vietnam. I honestly believe that if this film had just focused on the training of the platoon then this film would have been fantastic and tension filled, things that were very much lacking from the rest of the actual film. 58%/C+",5,5,11,1 December 2016
American Sniper," One of Eastwoods Best Efforts
",I have always said that if a movie is based on a true story you have to judge the movie not the story of characters it's based on and that's why I believe a lot of people have come to hate this movie but I love it. Clint Eastwood's movies are extremely hit or miss but he is always extremely skilled behind the camera and he exceed at his job as a director with flying colours he makes for so many intense and nail biting action sequences along with quitter and more personal moments between Chris Kyle and his wife played to perfection by Bradley Cooper. Cooper is amazing in this movie I believe this to be to date his greatest performance I knew that he could act after seeing movies like Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle but here he just brings his action ability to a whole new level bringing a humanity to his character even during the real life persons more controversial moments. The reasons why Kyle does what he does in the film are extremely satisfying you just get the feeling that he just wants to help his country because he believes in it and what's to do his part in helping it. The rivalry that develops between Kyle and an enemy sniper throughout the movie is extremely riveting it grounds Kyle as a character and makes you realise that he isn't the legend he has been poised to be that he is human and may have met his match. Sienna Miller really impressed me with this film I thought that she had excellent chemistry with Cooper and perfectly portrayed a struggling wife wanting to help and understand her husband. Where the film falters thought is the fact that it never really addresses the controversy of Chris Kyle I have no opinion on the man personally but I just think that it would have overall made the film just a but more interesting. But Overall I love American Sniper I think it is for the most part an excellent analysis of its title character and creates for a riveting and very intimate movie that perfectly portrays the struggles of war and those who fight in them.A-93%,9,13,18,13 October 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A Truly Fantastic Final Act At The Expense of The Rest of The Film
","Attack of The Clones is generally considered by most to be the worst Star Wars film and overall just a bad film and while I personally wouldn't go that far I think this is an incredibly flawed film that has a few redeeming features mainly to do with the final 30 minutes. This last act is truly fantastic, not only will an Star Wars fan take joy in seeing the true power of the Jedi but it's also just entertaining, the massive battle that has been built up has been extremely well executed and truly gave us a sense of the power of these two opposing forces. The final lightsaber battle of the film while not very intense internally is still fairly well choreographed and made for a somewhat epic conclusion, all the action sequences are very well done I just wish there had been more of them. The performances in this film are a bit of a mixed bad but the one undeniable positive of this entire trilogy is Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi, he just brings a wise nature yet vulnerability to this already iconic character not only in this film but the trilogy as a whole. However this film still has its fair share of flaws. For one while the last act is riveting and engaging the first two are dull and drab, just dialogue heavy exposition with no real heart or intensity to it, the characters are not built up in any way and the villains are given no motivation or backstory making giving them no really presence. The central romance in this movie just simply does not work mainly because the two actors have very little chemistry due to the poor dialogue and script. Green Screen environments are used frequently in this film and it always shows and comes across as incredibly fake. I really don't like criticising performances but here I have too Hayden Christensen was truly bad in this film, he never really embodied Anakin as a complex character but mainly as just a whiny brat that did not make for a compelling protagonist. This film also sets up some very good ideas or plot lines that are either brushed over or all but forgotten about and came across as lazy at times.Attack of The Clones in my opinion is not an awful movie but far from a great one, while the actual Attack of The Clones itself is very well done the rest of the film has poor characters and dialogue, it fails to be compelling and wastes very good actors that could have made for potentially engaging characters. Despite its serious flaws I still consider this film to be at least a marginal improvement over The Phantom Menace. 68%/B-",6,1,2,30 December 2016
Gone Baby Gone," Gone In A Second
","I love Ben Afflecks work, both as an actor and a director he has consistently blown me away with his work, while he went on to say great things with his directorial ability I can't say he had a great start in what I found to be an extremely misguided crime thriller. Another trope of Ben Affleck I find recently is that even when he isn't in a good movie he tends to be the highlight of it and this is the case here to, his work behind the camera is truly excellent here, he's not afraid to go slow and a lot of his shots are done all in wide angles without cuts and it's extremely effective, this film doesn't have a whole lot of action but when it comes he handles it very well, nothing about the violence feels like a movie, but realistic and often shocking. In all his films he uses the location as a character and it's no different here and adds this dark feeling that stays consistent throughout the film.The performances here are all stellar, Casey Affleck gives a very subtle performance here, you can read a lot of his face without him saying anything and carries a lot of this film for me. Ed Harris is also fantastic in this movie, a very wounded and tired performance then he plays extremely well. Amy Ryan absolutely floored me in this movie, she was so despicable I couldn't believe and absolutely earned her Oscar nomination for her work here. The ending was handled perfectly in this film, it asks the audience to think for itself and doesn't give any easy answers, it leaves them feeling unfulfilled and makes you look back in the entire film as a whole. It was a bold note to end on and I really admired them for not giving a stereotypical happy ending. But I find this film to be very mediocre for a few reasons for one, the pacing. This film drags for large portions and honestly bored me quite a bit. A lot of that has to do with a lot of meaningless sequences, the film takes a turn about half way through and nothing ever comes of it other than to extend the run time. Before the ending nothing that happened really stayed with me and makes this film rather dull for me.I have no issue with slow movies but I have to be invested in the characters for that to be a benefit and I don't care for most of these characters, many of them are one note and just have a tendency to repeat the same dialogue over and over again. I don't care about them so I don't particularly care for the situation. I particularly didn't care for Michelle Monaghan's character, I didn't feel like she had much chemistry with Affleck so I didn't really buy their romance. The twist in this movie is also very mishandled, not only was it really cliché but a lot of the characters involved with this twist feel forced in and don't feel very within character for them, it adds something to the ending but on its own it does nothing to me except for making me feel underwhelmed. The Town is one of my favourite movies, Argo is one of my favourite Best Picture winners and I even enjoyed Live By Night for what it was but I really couldn't get behind this film. I like the direction, performances and ending but the film as a whole is bogged down by weak characters, an unearned twist and slow pacing. I'll still watch anything Ben Affleck directs but I can't say he hit the ground running in his career as a director. 5.5/10: C (Mediocre)",5,1,2,24 August 2017
American Hustle," At This Point It's Not Overrated It's Underrated
","David O Russell's American Hustle is an extremely controversial film and I don't understand that controversy because I think this is an amazing crime thriller that reminds me of classic Scorsese movies. This movie on the wrong hands could have been very boring but it's not this movie is one that entertains me from start to finish and that's because of Russell's direction he maintains a fast pace and consistent tone that keeps me loving this film every time I watch it. The performances in this movie are all fantastic for one Bradley Cooper absolutely steals the show here he's amazing in this movie because he makes his character so unpredictable and unhinged but you can't help but be excited for when he gets back on screen. Amy Adams should have got the Oscar for this movie because she is such an unpredictable character your never completely sure where she's standing but you still route for her. Christian Bale gives another one of his legendary Body transformations in this movie and he gives one of his finest performances here because you can't just help but like him despite all the bad things he's done and continues to do. I love the fact that this movie was set in the 70s it just makes the film look more glamorous and Russell captures the period perfectly I didn't live in the 1970s but after watching this movie I feel like I have. The narration in American Hustle works which is good because if done wrong it can become very frustrating and overloading but helps you understand that characters mindsets and motivations. But without a doubt my biggest issue with this movie though is Jennifer's Lawrence's character don't get me wrong I love Jennifer Lawrence she gets way to much hate and she's fantastic in this movie but her character has far to much screen time than is necessary and it gets on the viewers nerves quickly. Overall I adore American Hustle it's a fantastic film with terrific performances, great direction and an entertaining, fast paced plot. A-93%",10,3,6,3 July 2016
Fargo," A Unique, Funny and Entertaining Crime Thriller
","I wasn't really sure what I was going to think of this movie when I sat down to watch it because while I don't always agree with The Coen Brothers sense of humour I've always found them to be excellent directors of action and actors and I'm glad to say that I thought this film was fantastic. Fargo has a perfect run time it never drags for a single second yet everything is wrapped up perfectly in the relatively short run time. I really thought that the accents in this film were going to get on my nerves after a while but they didn't it fit perfectly with the characters and its actually another thing that makes this film so unique. From scene one William H Macy impressed my he was just so perfect at being a pathetic and slimy human being and while you don't ever side with what he's trying to do you kind off in a way sympathise with him because of all the hardships he's has and absolutely earned his Oscar nomination. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare were both fantastic in this film I thought they bounced of each other perfectly and created for some really entertaining dialogue scenes between the two. The whole plot of the kidnapping gone wrong was exhilarating seeing all the characters trying to avoid the law and getting caught hiding evidence and double crossing each other made for some great tension and gave this film its entertainment value but the thing I absolutely hated about this film was the character of Marge Gunderson. She stopped this movie from being perfect, don't get me wrong I thought that Frances McDormand was great in this film but the character was just so annoying her interaction with her husband was awkward and annoying to watch and at the bare minimum it just wasn't as interesting as the kidnapping plot. She just didn't need to be in this movie and it really held this film back for me. I'm not going to say that McDormand was bad in this film but I can't say that same for he character or her arc but luckily this film had far to much good in it for one character to ruin it for me. I really enjoyed Fargo it's a non-stop crime thriller with a great movie plot and it's perfect paced despite the atrocious female lead. 84%/A-",8,0,1,30 October 2016
Nightcrawler," Steady Hands
","For the past 3 years I've heard nothing but good things about Nightcrawler and heard nothing but critical acclaim for Jake Gyllenhaal performance and after seeing it I can easily say that all that praise is easily deserved, this is a film unlike any other that I've ever seen, the whole idea of people listen to police frequencies and filming crime scenes for the news is a strange plot but one that was honestly fascinating to watch, seeing the lengths that these people go to for footage made the film much more interesting to watch, it definitely felt like it was an area that had been exploited and added to the creep factor of this film. Much like the film itself the thing I loved about Jake Gyllenhaals performance was how different it was, the formal way he spoke and the repetitive techniques he uses to talk to people made his character an interesting presence. This film also did something for me that very few other films have, it didn't bother me that it had a lot of awkward interactions between characters, it added to the unhinged and strange nature of Gyllenhaals character. The main character is the thing that carries this movie and he is most definitely not this films hero, I could just as easily describe him as an antagonist because he does such horrible things in this film that make you realise that he's not the 'good guy' but instead a pretty horrific person. This film also has a really great atmosphere to it, it made LA night life feel gritty and violent. Meg Ryan was also brilliant in this film she felt like a real professional and the perfect opposing force to Gyllenhaal, she's also a very well written character that has clear vulnerabilities that makes her better rounded as a person. I only really have on flaw with this film and it's Riz Ahmed's character, Ahmed was brilliant in this film but the character was boring, he had no presence to him, he got on my nerves a lot and the scenes between them never really grabbed me like the rest of the film did. This is a truly original and different film, Gyllenhaal gives his best performance since Zodiac, the main protagonist is interesting to watch, it's got such a real life and gritty vibe to it and it was only aspects of Ahmed's character that got to me in an overall truly fantastic film. 9.3/10: A (Phenomenal)",9,0,0,27 January 2017
The Aviator," A Solid (Central) Character Piece
","Martin Scorsese's films all have a distinctive style and tone to them so it's always been nice to see him change things up a bit and while this most certainly has hints of his style The Aviator was a nice departure from his usually films and I can honestly say that I enjoyed this film though it's not without its flaws. Easily the best thing about this film is the central performance of Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, DiCaprio just brings a presence to Hughes making him very charismatic yet charming, his character is never dull to watch and it's always interesting to watch. Mainly because his breakdown into near insanity is so well done, its built up slowly across the films run-time so that when that pivotal moment where he loses his mind it feels merited. If I'm honest I've never been the biggest fan of Cate Blanchett but I can honestly say that I thought she was excellent in this movie, not only was her character just extremely entertaining she had such good chemistry with DiCaprio and her romance with him joint with their gradual parting is done perfectly. The Aviator it set from the mid 30s to the late 40s and the production design joint along with the Costume Design are immaculate, it sucks you right into this period. The actual aviation scenes themselves sequences themselves are very well done, the green screen is completely convincing and they're built up just right so that we understand just how much they mean to Hughes. However if I'm honest while this film is far to well acted and executed to be bad I do think this film is a little overrated. For one while the central character is developed perfectly and given good and clear motivations for his actions the other characters in this film have very little reasoning behind their actions so when they start their attacks against Hughes they don't feel earned and this makes this entire arc fall a bit flat. Another thing this film doesn't do very well is make you feel much sympathy for Hughes, because he's such an unlikable character it doesn't really make you care that much that he has so much at stake. However after this arc finishes I enjoyed the final act and DiCaprios haunting last 'The Way of The Future' monologue was extremely haunting that did make me feel sympathy for him unlike the previous act of the film. I do like The Aviator, both DiCaprio and Blanchett are both amazing in this film, it's a fantastic period piece but ultimately where it succeeds with its central character it ultimately fails with the Supporting making for a lot of this film coming of as unsatisfactory. But it's definitely a good film and would recommend it to any fan of Scorsese's work. 72%/B",7,0,0,5 January 2017
Watchmen," A Daring Narrative That Tests The Limits of Film
","Zack Snyder's Watchmen is an extremely ambitious movie that seemed as if it would be impossible to make into a feature film so even if this film hadn't worked and had fallen apart I would still have to admire the effort of trying to bring such a complicated narrative to film but luckily I can do more than just admire the effort, I can marvel at a truly fantastic superhero film that I happen to love. One of the things I love the most about this movie the fact that it is first and foremost a character piece, we have constant flashbacks to our main protagonists, giving us backstory to them and how it shaped the people they are today. These flashbacks never feel forced or distracting, they never stop the pace but flow naturally and feel organic to the film. All the characters are uniquely different and entertaining in their own right with my favourite easily being Rorschach played to perfection in an amazing performance by Jackie Earle Haley, the character is such a wounded and violent soul which makes him entertaining and investing he by far has the best arc in this film. I also loved the character of Nite Owl, he seemed like such a real person weighed down by the legacy he feels he cannot live up too and I loved his chemistry with Silk Spectre. The defining trait of these characters are that they ultimately see themselves as doing the right thing and are fighting for something if the greater good but characters like The Comedian balance out the characters creating for a much more colourful and entertaining cast. While the characters do make this film something else I loved about this film was its realism, despite being set in an alternate history this film seemed close to how events like these would occur in real life, the way the public and government react to the whole idea of heroes seemed to be a close telling of how people would react should we be faced with similar obstacles. A common error in superhero films nowadays is a lack of a truly compelling villain but this film doesn't have that problem because all the characters are built up so well he is given crystal clear motivations and while you never quite see yourself agreeing with him you can see the place he is coming from which gives him a better opposition to the heroes. My only flaw with the film is Dr Manhattans sub plot the character in my opinion just was the only character that never made any kind of impression on me, he came across as dull and spends much of the film in solitude that never gives him the excellent interaction that the other characters have making him a fairly forgettable part of this film. Watchmen is a film that leaves its viewers thinking, it mimics real life and it's amazing cast of characters make this film not only entertaining but intriguing to watch, it's an ambitious film and most of its ambition pays of creating for a film that I will not soon forget. 92%/A",9,0,3,6 January 2017
Baby Driver," Music To My Ears
","I really like Edgar Wright as a directors, he's not quite one of my favourite directors working today for the simple fact that despite Scott Pilgrim Vs The World (a film I've yet to see) I haven't seen him really get out of his comfort zone. As much as I love his Cornetto trilogy they're all, even if purposefully so, very similar so I wanted to fully see what he was capable of doing, a Baby Driver proved to me that he is a forced to be reckoned with, I do think this is his best film to date and one of the best of the year so far. It's completely clear from the very beginning that this is Edgar Wrights movie, he has a very unique style that I've always loved, it's very sleek with a lot of quick edits which works perfectly with the pace of the action sequences. I loved his decision to match up his action sequences, as well as simple dialogue or movement scenes to music, though I've never listened to any of the songs in this film it made it more engaging as well as unique. This film has a fantastic cast, Ansel Elgort has never impressed me so I wasn't sure how I would feel about him in this movie but I think he nailed it, playing on Baby's more tragic side as well as his complete commitment physically makes this easily his best performance. I loved Jon Hamm in this movie, I liked how he played his characters gradual downward spiral, Jamie Foxx was really intense in this movie as well as having a great back and forth with Elgort, I loved Kevin Spacey he was really ominous and you could tell that he had some kind of motive and other plan behind everything he did. Lily James was great in this movie she was very likable and had a really good romantic chemistry with Ansel Elgorts character. I really liked the arcs of every character in this film, while not every character gets detailed backstory you get the impression that it was what Wright was trying to go for, to try and better show the ominous nature of this whole organisation and the people involved in it. I loved Baby's arc if learning from his mistakes and excepting consequences for his actions it made his character more likable as well as better rounded. There were definitely some cliché aspects of Kevin Spaceys character of a crime boss trying to get back a debt from the protagonist but I liked that they gave the character some heart as well as some good head butting scenes with the people who worked for him. I also loved the ever growing tension between Foxx and Elgorts characters that really came to ahead in a nice way.I didn't know how I'd feel about the romantic sub plot in this movie but I have to say it really worked for me. I absolutely believed that these two characters had a connection. Not only do the actors play off each other very well but the characters are just written so well that you want the whole situation to end in their favour. It also felt very believable, it didn't feel like it was some cheesy romantic drama but a real relationship that I really could get behind. My only real issue with this movie is some aspects of the way it concludes, now I did love how they wrapped up Baby's character and his romance with Collins but in some ways the conclusion to the arcs outside of that did feel a bit rushed, it seemed as if some many arcs had been built up throughout the film that needed to be concluded but it did feel a bit rushed in some ways they went about doing it. Baby Driver completely succeeded at what it was trying to be, an entertaining crime thriller with a good heart, solid characters and an investing love story. I loved the way Edgar Wright directed this movie, all the actors performances as well as the arcs of the characters they played, though the conclusion to a lot of the films arcs did feel a bit rushed the overall quality of the film only makes me more excited for what Edgar Wright is going to do next. 9.3/10: A (Phenomenal)",9,12,21,11 August 2017
Man of Steel," A Different Kind of Superhero Movie
","Before I saw this movie I was never a big fan of Superman but after what they did with his character in this movie I was blown away and now have a whole new appreciation for Superman and his lore. This movie is amazing I loved it, it does everything a superhero movie should do and so much more and I'm annoyed at people who have come to turn against it. Henry Cavill was great in this movie his character may be a bit to serious at times but he always brings humanity to his performance. I loved Amy Adams as Lois Lane she had great chemistry with Cavill and I loved the attitude of her character, that definitely feels right out of the comics. I adored Michael Shannon in this movie he was so good and making Zod not only menacing but also vulnerable, while you never support him you understand why he is doing all, these terrible things and I even found myself sympathetic to him at certain points, the created a compelling villain that other superhero movies need to take notes from. Russell Crowe is one of my favourite actors working today and I loved him in this movie, we've never seen him play a character like this before but he pulled it of beautifully, I loved his characters vision and his scenes with Kal-El were a very nice touch. One of the reasons I didn't really like Superman that much before this movie was because he didn't seem a little to silly and had to many unbelievable aspects to him. Things like Lois Lane never realising the identity of Superman, they do away with that in this movie and it felt much more real to me. I was also happy that they don't really call the title character Superman I loved that they called him Kal-El instead of just going straight to naming him Superman. I also loved the costume of Superman it felt updated to a modern world. Zack Snyder did a fantastic job directing this movie he filmed to action to perfection, he knows exactly what to do to show the destructive powers of these gods. Probably one of the most divisive scenes in this movie is the death of Jonathan Kent, I, loved this scene, you definitely understood why it left such an impression on Clark and was a really good showcase for the relationship between father son. But my only real issue with this movie is the overuse of action and destruction in this film, I know that wanted to make a showcase for the power of these two gods but it was just overused to the point of stupidity. I really do love this movie all the performances were fantastic, it took certain liberties with the character in a good way, while they may have been overused the action scenes were still amazing, I think this is one of the best superhero movies we have.96%/A",9,2,4,18 November 2016
The Revenant," Visually Incredible but Narratively Repetitive
","The Revenant was a film I was very curious about, I love Leonardo DiCaprio and AGI has proved himself to be one of the most ambitious directors working today and after seeing it I really liked this movie I didn't quite love it but I have to admire its ambitiousness. What they were able to accomplish with this film technically is Incredible, while there aren't a whole lot of action sequences in this movie when there is, it is absolutely stunning this film contains some of the most realistic violence I've ever seen with its incredible long, uncut takes and realistic make up and excellent performances from the extras all come together to put the viewer right in their and make them feel the danger of the situation. In the lead up to this movie its was highly anticipated that DiCaprio was finally going to win his Oscar for this film and he did, he was great in this movie, not only did he commit himself physically to this part he was also perfect at conveying the pain and suffering that his character was feeling. However to my surprise I actually thought Tom Hardy was better in this film, Hardy completely digs himself into this roles to create such a despicable character but one that is understandably so, you get his experiences in life and understand his hateful attitude and ruthlessness and it's easily one of Hardys greatest performances. The Revenant contains some of the greatest cinematography I've ever seen this film looks incredible, the snowy landscapes look incredible you feel the cold and the misery of these environments and it's all due to the extremes The the filmmakers went to, in order to make this film look as realistic as it does. However this films greatest shortcoming is its repetitiveness and melodrama. The sequences where DiCaprios character blacks out and has hallucinations and flashbacks just feel odd and unnecessary, they don't really add anything to the hatred of the character. This film does have A tendency to rely on a formula that becomes blatant really quickly, Glass crawls around for a little while, feels a lot of pain, finds himself in a bad situation, fixes that situation conveniently, we get a wide shot pointing up towards the sky. This pretty much happens for the entirety of the second act and actually started to bore me at times. The Revenant is a very good film its incredibly ambitious, everything technically is incredible, the performances are fantastic, it's extremely atmospheric, it does have some issues with its story but I honestly think that any film fan should watch this movie at some point. 80%/A-",8,0,0,24 November 2016
Bridge of Spies," Far From Spielbergs Best But Still Fantastic
","When I first saw Bridge of Spies in theatres it was purely because it was a Spielberg film yet I was still intrigued to see it I love Tom Hanks he's one of my all time favourite actors and thought it isn't Spielbergs best it's far from his worst and Bridge of Spies is a fantastic film with two Fantastic lead performances from both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance. Like more of Spielbergs more recent films this is more of a dialogue driven drama and it's not discredit to him his films all have amazing dialogue and this is no different it makes for a compelling film that any Spielberg fan should watch. Tom Hanks in his fourth collaboration with Spielberg is fantastic in this film he's impossible not to get behind he just knows how to portray the every man quality of his character that just wants to do the right thing and that's what makes James Donovan such a great protagonist for this film he just wants to do the right thing despite all the hatred it brings him. But ultimately movie new comer Mark Ryalnce stole this movie and deservedly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for it he has amazing chemistry with Hanks. Ryalnce just brings a likability and vulnerability to him and his 'Standing Man' scene will go down as one of the great movie scenes in a Spielberg movie. The courtroom scenes in this movie really gave you a sense of how people were during this time and gives you a chance to see what Donovan and Abel were facing for what they were trying to do. The flaws from this film though come from its second half the plot to free Powers just wasn't neither as compelling as the plot to free Abel and I would have personally would have portrayed his character more like James Ryan from another Spielberg film 'Saving Private Ryan' it just would have made us more excited to finally see him and would have made for a more compelling story arc.But in the end I like Bridge of Spies much more than I ever thought I would it has fantastic dialogue, characters and performances making for one of the finest films of 2015. 88%-A-",8,1,1,14 October 2016
Hugo," A Different Kind of Scorsese Film
","I adore Martin Scorsese he's mastered a very particular kind of film but if I have one complaint about him it would be that a lot of his films are very similar when it comes to structure and tone but Hugo does not suffer from this and I found to be fantastic. This is a film that every film fan should see it's got a really fantastic tribute to cinemas Past and has a great way of exploring a child like sense of adventure and wonder. This film loom so incredible and cgi and green screens aren't even noticeable they make the city of Paris come alive with wonder and amazement. The practically built sets also look amazing like the train station that is so well designed and this is by far one of Scorsese' best looking movies. The screenplay in this film is just fantastic it's has a great way of appealing to its audience and always keeping its characters interesting and investing technically everything in this movie is perfect but also are the central performances. Asa Butterfield was so good in this movie he's just the right amount of vulnerable yet brave he was also really sympathetic all thanks to his performance. Chloe Grace Moretz has great chemistry with Butterfield I thought that they brought the best out of each other in their characters and performances. But Ben Kingsley in my opinion gave the best performance in this movie he captures the right spirit of his character at first a tired and directionless old man but you soon start to understand why he is that way and it just gives him more room to give the best performance possible and that's exactly what he did. Sacha Baron Cohen gives the best performance of his entire career in this film not only is he really funny but also very sympathetic and proved that he could do more than put on a funny voice to give a performance. The central mystery was a great way to ground the story it makes this film more focused and gives you a great guessing game that puts you in the central characters minds and makes you relate to them more. However I think this films greatest issue is the way it handles some of its supporting characters, some of the more minor characters are just cruel and horrible for no reason and some character arcs never come into their own or are just left behind. Hugo is a fantastic film it absolutely nails everything on a technical level and has wonderful performances the central mystery is intriguing and it's so great to see such a legendary director get out of his comfort zone. While I don't think this is going to go down as one of his all time classics it deserved to do better and the box office and will be remembered by its loyal fans and supporters. 87%/A-",8,2,3,9 November 2016
American Beauty," A Unique and Compelling Experience
","Sam Mendes' 'American Beauty' is a strange movie but one that is interesting and relatable and has an interesting way of looking at its characters in a relatable and human way lead by an incredible performance from Kevin Spacey. Spacey just eats this character up he makes him human and sympathetic, every time he's punched around by his family or just life in general Spacey pulls it of with class and defiantly earned his Oscar for this movie. Annette Benning was also great in this film she completely sinks herself into the character of this horrible and cruel wife while I do have some problems with her character Bennings performance is not one of them. I have seen very little of Wes Bentley but he blew me away in this movie I loved his character he at first comes off as an outsider but you come to realise that he has the freedom that very few others do and in a way come to envy him. I love Chris Cooper but I had no idea he was capable of giving such a terrifying performance he's so good in this film and his character arc is such a delight to watch, you come to understand why he is the way he is and come to feel as much sympathy for him than you do for Spacey. Everyone in this movie has a compelling character arc that always gives its characters something to do. Spaceys arc was easily the films best it's just encases everything that anyone would ever want to do if they just let go of the what's expected of him. The way this movie looks at suburban American is done just right it's not done in an insulting way but in an eye opening way, we are able to see how it can tie people down and limits their capabilities. Every decision made by a character in this film makes sense, no matter how bad the choices may be we get why they make them even the eventual murder of Spaceys character is done in an understandable way. However I do have a few problems with this movie for one every character was understandable except for Bennings she just was a horrible person and we never really understood why, she's clearly The one to blame for the bad marriage and they should have devoted more time to build her character up more. I didn't mind the fact that Spaceys character dies in the end but I really wish that they had left it open ended, like me have to guess which one character was responsible for the murder and would have warranted more repeat viewings and made the film all the more compelling. American Beauty is such a great film it's got a beautiful (pun intended) of handling its characters and themes it's directed and edited beautifully and there is no other movie like it. 86%/A-",8,1,2,10 November 2016
Silver Linings Playbook," A Movie Anyone Can Relate Too and Enjoy
","In Life We've all had are ups and our downs, been in crazy relationships and had parts of ourselves that nobody else can truly understand and all of this is addressed in David O Russel's, Silver Linings Playbook. This movie perfectly balances Drama and Comedy to create for both a heartbreaking and heartwarming movie that every one can relate too. The performances in this movie are mind blowing with Bradley Cooper really surprising me with his lovable portrayal of a man who struggles with his conditions but you're able to get behind him because Cooper always portrays him as a good person at heart. Jennifer Lawrence one an Oscar for her performance and it's well deserved it showed that a she could to more than be Mystique or Katniss Everdeen she has absolutely Amazing Chemistry with Bradley Cooper and you truly feel their connection together. Robert De Niro does some of his best work here as Coopers father trying desperately to hold his home and family together with De Niro showing Vulnerability and Emotion that we've rarely seen from him. Behind all these great performances is a great director and David O Russel is proving to me more and more that he is one of the best directors working today he doesn't get in the way of these amazing performances he holds back and let's you see them. Every character in this move has something that makes them a human being and relatable making you care more about them towards the film climax. The main plot point of the movie is the romance between Cooper and Lawrence and you care so much about them getting together you just feeling every time they have a scene with just the two of them. I have but one flaw one this movie and it is the sub-plot between Cooper and his ex wife there's never really any scene where you get the chance to see them together as a couple and see what Coopers character is missing so much with her. Overall Silver Linings Playbook was one of the greatest movies of 2012 and is virtually universally Beloved if you want to watch a relatable film about life and relationships then watch this film right now. 94%-A",9,0,1,6 October 2016
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Movie That Just Stays With You Whether You Like It Or Not
",The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen when you finish watching this movie you will feel violated. That is a positive that a movie can stay with you and leave that impression with you weeks even months after watching it. A lot of that is due to David Finchers direction he doesn't hold back in the violent and disturbing scenes and moments he leaves the viewer to just look and it shows how much he respects the viewer to take it. This movie looks stunning especially in the snowy landscapes that are just amazing to look at and allows you to take in the atmosphere that is being created. The performances in this movie are some of the best that Fincher has ever produced with Rooney Mara absolutely stealing the show she's amazing in this movie and gave one of the best performances I've ever seen and should have taken home the Oscar for her performance but her performance depends on her chemistry with Daniel Craig and they have fantastic chemistry with each other because you feel as if they are themselves when they're together. Daniel Criag and Christopher Plummer still pull their wait in the movie and are both fantastic in their respective roles. First and foremost this is an investigation movie so that investigation has to be compelling and it absolutely is like so many of Finchers previous films you absolutely get invested in the mystery and are desperate to find out who it is allowing the user to try and guess the murderer on their own. My biggest and really only issue with the movie is the ending. Not the ending to the mystery no that's a great reveal but I have always thought that Lisbeth suddenly falling in love with Michel because it just feels out of place with the rest of her character arc and leaves you some what unsatisfied. Other than that I absolutely adore this movie and I really wished than the other two in the trilogy would have been made by Fincher. 96%-A,9,0,1,4 July 2016
Dunkirk," This Generations 'Saving Private Ryan'
","Sometimes when I anticipate a film for so long, all the way through its production from the time it is announced it's almost an odd feeling when i finally sit down in the theatre and watch it for the first time, But unlike in the past this film did not disappoint me in the slightest, not only did it live up to my, honesty unreasonably high expeditions, it exceeded all of them by being something I never expected. The structure of the film was something I wasn't sure would work, having three perspectives all in different times could have been rather jarring and incomprehensible but it wasn't, it only helped to add to the scale and stakes of this whole event and not only how important it was that it succeeded but also just how difficult victory was going to be to achieve. This film doesn't put much effort into developing its characters, usually that would bother me but here it didn't. I got the impression that this film wasn't about the characters or the actors playing them but instead about the situation they were in. I didn't have any issuer getting behind any of her because the importance of this operations success was so well established it was clear how important it was for them to survive and get home. While Dunkirk is most definitely not a performance piece all the actors are great in this film. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy are probably the stand outs but the new comers do deserved credit, they don't have much dialogue but they but still perfectly convey they're need to survive. Christopher Nolan has been one of my favourite directors of all time for so long and I knew he was going to do magnificent things with this movie and he did not disappoint. He did some of his best work ever here. He kept such a consistent pace from the opening scene he puts you right into the situation and doesn't let up by constantly showing chaos and destruction all within camera with no cgi or green screen making it feel all the more real. The aerial dogfight sequences were incredible, nothing about them felt fake, they felt real, intense and confined and because of them only lasting one hour of time they never let up. As much as this film showed a lot of death and insurmountable odds it also has such a great message about hope and what people can truly accomplish when they band together which gives this film a much needed heart instead of it just being a non-stop thrill ride. Dunkirk is a cinematic masterpiece, it lived up to everyone of my incredibly high expectations and exceeded them giving me one of the most unique war films ever made. Everything from a technical, performance and writing standpoint was done perfectly to the pout where this film felt more like an experience and less like a viewing. 10/10-A+ (Incredible)",10,7,14,5 August 2017
X-Men: Days of Future Past," An EXceptional Masterpiece
","I have watched every X Men movie ever made, I like almost all of them, they have amazing characters and thought provoking themes, I was beyond excited for this movie it was easily my most anticipated of 2014 and it did not disappoint me at all I was blown away by a superhero masterpiece than is the only superhero movie to come close to the greatness of The Dark Knight Trilogy. For one this film is perfectly balanced, despite all the characters and plot threads present in this film there's never any overlap, wasted characters or clunkiness, I was invested in every part of this film. Hugh Jackman was brilliant in this film not only is he hilarious as usual but he also fits right in with McAvoy and Fassbender characters who once again are fantastic together, we get the sense that these two now have a history that has deeply effected them both. One of my favourite elements of First Class was that we saw Xavier in a different light and this film is no different, we see him now as a broken man who is all out of hope and it was a brilliant way of showing his character. The future isn't in this film a whole lot but it's used in just the right ways, we have all the characters from the future together again which was so satisfying to see and seeing them all taken down together was amazing to watch unfold and helped to showcase the power that these sentinels have. The Sentinels are perfect antagonists for the future time-line they are clearly a menacing presence who make you realise the intense nature of the desolate future. The past time-line mostly centres around Wolverine and his allies trying to stop Mystique from murdering Bolivar Trask played to perfection by Peter Dinklage this story line was done just as well as the future, it was just as intense and the eventual cutting in and out of the time-lines added to the intense nature. The eventual conclusion of the past was done perfectly, it was really heartwarming to see Charles pore his heart out to Raven added to their bond. This last fight was devastating to watch but was ultimately satisfying in its conclusion of having the time-line restored and bettered. This is one of the only films that has ever made me disappointed after it was finished, because I won't get to watch it for the first time again but I could not be more pleased with the film itself, all the characters have returned and are better than ever, it perfectly blends everything and as a hardcore and committed X Men fan this film was just a tribute to the characters of the comics and the franchise itself. 100%/A+",10,0,0,13 January 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A Fantastic New Side of The Harry Potter Universe
","With Harry Potter being a franchise I grew up experiencing I was of course very excited for Fantastic Beasts, I know everyone wasn't satisfied with this film but I found it to be a very exciting new adventure in the Harry Potter universe that left me excited for more to come.The magic of HP mostly carries over to this new world, it's great to see this new part of the universe from an adult perspective that makes this new series seem more mature than its predecessor. The American Wizarding community was built very well with fantastic visual effects, production and costume design that puts you in that 1920s setting.The new characters also mostly lived up to expectations. Eddie Redmayne played Newt perfectly, such a lovable and understated protagonist that allows us to feel his love for these beasts through him. Tina was a cute addition to the film, she had a great chemistry with Newt that built there relationship slowly. Queenie wasn't as developed as much as I would like but she was still a likeable and find part of the cast. Kowalski was my favourite character in this film, the perfect comic relief who had a great arc of his own and allowing us to see his a human would react to this amazing world in a satisfying way. The beasts themselves also lived up to their magical potential. They all looked distinctive and visually alive that allowed them to seem as terrifying as they did adorable.The film despite its magical elements, does have a lot going on and not all the plot elements mesh well together. There are a lot of subplots going on between the beasts and the American Ministry and they don't always play off each other well and do occasionally drag down the pacing. The tone isn't always on point with many of the lighter elements clashing with the films darker and more mature moments that leave the audience confused as to what emote they should be feeling.Fantastic Beasts is a great new addition to the Harry Potter world. It seamlessly builds the world to new heights while having its own feeling and sense of magic. The beasts themselves are visually striking and the new characters all make their mark. The pacing may sometimes be spotty and the tones may not always clash but it's a perfectly entertaining movie that sets up a new side of this world that can only continue to grow.8.4/10 - A- (Fantastic)",8,0,0,31 December 2018
Quantum of Solace," James Bourne (And Not In a Good Way)
","Like Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace is unlike any other Bond film that came before it. The sad thing is that in Casino's case that was a massive benefit to the film whereas Quantum of Solace is a disappointing entry to the series as opposed to being an excellent sequel that should've better come out of Casino Royale's momentum.Craig is once again excellent as the character and portrays him as more wounded than he did in the previous entry. His arc was the strongest part of the film for me I was invested in his vendetta and found the conclusion to his arc to be a fitting end to a two-film arc. The support characters are mostly solid, Judi Dench is once again excellent as M and Olga Kurylenko was a solid foil for Craig that had a good arc that I was able to get invested in.The Film also looks fantastic. The desert settings as long as the all the other world wide locations all make for solid cinematography that does make for a satisfying visual experience. That's where the positives mostly end for me.Marc Foster is a director I admire but I did not care for his work in this film. The action is scattered and messy, it's almost impossible to follow and goes by too quickly for it to make an impact. The way he paces the film is also far too quick. It feels as if almost every scene is rushed where very little carries weight because there is very little time put towards making individual scenes mean anything.The villains were also the most basic exercises for antagonists. After the depth that was given to the last films villains is sad to see that the filmmakers made such little effort to give the antagonists any depth or real motivation. The it plan is beyond ridiculous that never feels like it has any urgency to it. The rivalry between them and bond isn't built up well and they energy fell like a true threat.The film overall is just underwhelming, it's almost completely forgettable with very few redeeming qualities. Craig's performance and Bonds arc are some ways to hook you in but almost everything else weighs them down. Despite the film looking great the messy and shaky directing almost completely hides that fact. It just doesn't feel like a true bond film and instead more like a cheap, lazy Jason Bourne rip off and that's something I should never feel about a bond film with this being the definitive action franchise.4.3/10 - C (Poor)",4,1,2,30 December 2018
No Country for Old Men," This is The Most The Coen Brothers Ever Gained On A Coin Toss
","I've never been the biggest fan of Joel and Ethan Coen when it comes to comedies I don't like their sense of humour and style but when they go dark and gritty they are amazing and No Country For Old Men is proof of this because this is one of my all time favourite movies. One reason this works for me as a Coen brothers movie is its relatively simple story a cat and mouse chase between a merciless assassin and a former Vietnam War Veteran with over 2 Million Dollars in stolen drug money. This creates for a constant sense of tension and bleakness that keeps me riveted every time I watch this movie and a lot of this can be attributed to Javier Bardems incredible, Oscar Winning Performance as the film antagonist Anton Chigurh. He just perfectly captures his characters mysterious and terrifying qualities that just get the audience begging for him to get back on screen and this truly is one of the greatest performances ever given in a movie. Thought Bardem steals this movie that does not take away from both Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. I Legitimately could not imagine anyone else playing Llewelyn Moss, Brolin is perfect in this movie he just gets the characters he's playing, portraying him as a morally schizophrenic character who you can never lock down as a person. The action scenes are few in this film but that works here as it makes them more satisfying named more real adding to the constant sense of tension. I can't quite explain why but I love the fact that this movie has no score it just works for this and couldn't imagine them doing it any other way. The cinematography of course is stunning but you can expect nothing less from Roger Deakins. The Coen Brothers best film truly did win at the Oscars it's truly one of the best pictures to win best picture and it's and incredible ride that makes me wish that The Coen Brothers would reach this quality more often. 100%-A+",10,1,1,1 October 2016
Batman Begins," The Definitive Superhero Origin Story
","Christopher Nolans 'Dark Knight Trilogy' is one of the greatest trilogies of all time and it all started with this movie that breathed new life into what was considered to be a dead franchise and proved that Nolan was a talent to be reckoned with. The way this film handles its central character is just perfect, Nolan creates a wounded and damaged character that is just amazing to watch. Wayne in this movie is not the perfect billionaire playboy that other films have presented him as he's got some major issues and makes some questionable choices in this films flashbacks. His training with The League of Shadows was done just right you got just home Important it was for him to pass them but understandable why he doesn't stay with them. Christian Bale was fantastic in this movie he captured all versions of the character that was require and to date remains the best iteration of the character. Katie Holmes was fine here she did that was required of her and was a good support for Bruce, while far from a great performance not razzie worthy. Liam Neeson was great as Ra's Al Ghul he's not in the film much but was really good when he was their and really felt like he was another version of Bruce and made some good points. Michael Caine is absolutely perfect casting for Alfred he hits just the right note between funny and fear and is never dull for a single second. Before this film the character of Commissioner Gordon had never been done much justice in film but Gary Oldman gave such a good performance in this movie and was a really likable presence. The action sequences in this film were really good they felt very realistic and gritty especially the final the sequence on this train that was a really intense and well done action set piece. The fear toxin was a really good plot device, you got his dangerous this was a why it needed to be stopped. I do have but one flaw with this film and it's the way in handle the villains. Scarecrow was good for the most part but he was far the easily defeated. Ra's Al Ghul needed to be in this film more and the swing between Ken Watanabe and Liam Neeson wasn't done well and felt very forced and awkward. This is an amazing film it got most of its characters right and went on to start the perfect superhero franchise.93%/A",9,1,2,9 November 2016
Saving Private Ryan," The Definitive War Film
","Steven Spielbergs, Saving Private Ryan has some of the best directing of all time, one of the greatest performances of all time from Tom Hanks and truly is one of the greatest films of all time as well as the greatest war film ever made. The opening scene alone makes this movie a masterpiece it's just the perfect way to set the stage for the threat and brutality of war and showing the solider who fought in it to be human beings who are just as terrified as anyone else would be in the same situation. But the film doesn't stop after that the hunt for Private Ryan is incredibly investing because you understand the reasons as to why even if you don't agree with them you understand them perfectly. The fact that the main characters choose to address the somewhat unfair nature of picking one particular solider to go home out of the thousands was a very good decision because you can't help but see their point of view and understand them more. Another good decision was the fact that we don't meet Private Ryan until about 2/3 of the way through the film it puts you in the characters difficult situation of finding one solider out of thousands. Like is said before Tom Hanks is truly amazing in this movie he gives his greatest performance in my opinion and one of the greatest of all time. A lot rides on Matt Damon as Private Ryan in this film because he has to come across as innocent enough and likable enough to justify all the hard ship and death that the characters go through in order to find him but he doesn't, Ryan doesn't want to leave and feels immense guilt for all that has been done in his name and this makes him a much more compelling character. While the opening scene on Normandy Beach is still the films best action sequences there are plenty of other amazing ones because they feel so real you know the danger these characters face when they charge into battle, war isn't glorified in this movie it's shown for what it is and nothing more. Tom Hanks final words to Ryan 'Earn This' is haunting and forces the viewer to think about how they would earn such a gift of life and creates for a truly emotional last scene with Ryan which is the perfect ending to this masterpiece. There are few films that are more universally beloved than Saving Private Ryan for good reasons it does everything that not only a war movie should do but movies as a whole.

JFK," An Engaging and Eye Opening Political Thriller
","The assassination of American President John Kennedy is one of the most talked about events in American history so making a film about such a talked over event was going to be no easy task but Oliver Stone pulled it of perfectly and may just be the best film he's ever given us next to Platoon. This film has an extremely long runtime and there's nothing wrong with that as long as they use it to the films advantage and they do, the first 30 minutes of this film takes the time to explore the effects of the assassination, the reasons why it effected To so many people and sets up the main character and his motivations played perfectly by Kevin Costner. I truly think that this is the greatest performance Kevin Costner has ever given because he perfectly strikes a balance between his obsession with solving the assassination and his commitments to his family, the character is just so well written, you understood why he was so obsessed and was an easy person to get behind. Tommy Lee Jones gives a performance like we've never seen from him before, he was fantastic in this film, he was such a despicable character and was the perfect foil for the plot of this film. A very young Gary Oldman was also great in this film as Lee Harvey Oswald, he leaves a really big impression for the rest of the film to follow and when we start to learn more about Oswalds character, Oldmans performance remains consistent. This film could have been extremely boring because of the amount of information that it has to give out but it never is. The film takes entire sequences to add emotional weight to the assassination and the masterful editing in this film allowed us to take in the information better. I really liked the fact that Stone didn't paint the assassination as just an act of pure evil, we begin to understand why JFK was killed and while you never support them, you understand why the assassins chose to kill him and made the film much more interesting. Another thing I loved about this movie was the sub plot of Garrisons family, it added to Costners character as we begin to see that his obsession with this case is becoming unhealthy, yet through conversations with his children we begin to further understand his motives and was really heartwarming at times. JFK is a masterpiece, it's engaging, never boring and extremely intriguing. While I'm not entirely sure if this film is completely accurate, it's probably somewhat close to the truth. It has fantastic performances, particularly that of Kevin Costner and may just be Stones best film. 100%/A+",10,10,18,11 December 2016
Gone Girl," A Thrilling Mystery
",David Fincher is the man when it comes to physiological thrillers and Gone Girl is one of his greatest movies with possibly his greatest plot twist. This is a film that is admittedly best on its first viewing for the intense mystery and whodunit that anyone can be intrigued by. The reason it's so investing is because they never rule out Afflecks character as a suspect and through flashbacks you even start to suspect him as well. The flashbacks are used perfectly they fill in the blanks as they should but add to the tension and mystery. The way this movie looks at the media and outside worlds perception of events forces the viewer to think about what they're mindset would be during a situation like this and makes the movie all the more fascinating. Like I said this movie is at its best on a first viewing but they thing that's really going to get people to come back and watch it again are the performances especially Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Affleck is just so believable in this film he's perfect at conveying his characters more scum bag qualities while also being very convincing at portraying the immense stress that he isn't under to prove his innocence. At first Pike seemed like a likable character with some real emotion to her but as soon as we discover what she really is it turns into without a doubt Pikes best performance. Tyler Perry was extremely entertaining as Afflecks lawyer he had great chemistry with the cast and really makes me hope that he'll come back to more dramatic roles like this. The ending of this movie is quite divisive at first i didn't know what to think but I soon realised that were meant to feel that way were meant to feel unsatisfied with the ending because that's how Afflecks character would feel. This movie of course is directed beautifully David Fincher creates for some dream tension and heartbreak throughout the run time. While Neil Patrick Harris was good in this movie I just didn't like his character and was a pretty annoying presence. Overall I love Gone Girl it's not for everyone but it's a deeply investing and disturbing movie that will go down as one of Finchers best efforts. 95%/A,10,0,2,27 October 2016
Django Unchained," A Guaranteed Classic
","The western genre has essentially died for decades but know surely people will now have noticed that gradually it's starting to come back with films like True Grit, Bone Tomahawk,The Revenant, The Hateful Eight Etc. But this was really the film that's started it Django Unchained is a masterpiece and my second favourite Tarantino movie falling just short of Inglorious Basterds for me. This movie just captures it's period so well to the point where you legitimately feel as if your in the west. Tarantino directs this film masterfully because he tried so many so things here he went for a faster pace and more action sequences and it all works and meshes well together. Jamie Foxx is fantastic in this movie because he acts just how he's supposed to as a real slave would in this situation and as he gradually talks more and acquires more confidence it feels gradual and makes for a greater performance. Christoph Waltz took home his second Oscar for this movie at he absolutely deserved it he's fantastic in this movie and steals every scene he's in almost. Leonardo DiCaprio is fabulous here as well playing the villain so perfectly to the point where I hate him I hate Leonardo DiCaprio that's unimaginable and in my opinion at least deserved an Oscar nomination. Tarantino usually likes to go for more dialogue sequences than action sequences but in Django Unchained he adds in more and it works there all filmed to perfection with intensity and ultimately there just really entertaining. The love story is where the film possibly could falter but know it works perfectly and its what gives the film it's heart and keeps it going. Django Unchained is one of the best westerns I've ever seen and proof that Tarantino can master any genre to create one of his finest movies and one of the best of 2012. 100%-A+",10,0,2,16 June 2016
Schindler's List," A Harrowing Tale of Heroism, Loss and Naivety
","Steven Spielbergs 'Schindlers List' is all but considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time and I can hardly disagree with such a statement because this is an incredible film that isn't always easy to watch but is the peak of writing, directing and acting. Liam Neeson and Oskar Schindler gives the greatest performance of his entire career in this film, Neeson brings a complexity to his character and a captivating nature to Schindler, Spielberg doesn't try to paint Schindler as a hero he builds him up as a man in an impossible situation trying to complete a mission he believes in and he has some truly amazing scenes with his 'power' monologue being possibly one of my all time favourite movie moments. Neeson also has some truly astonishing scenes with Ralph Fiennes who is absolutely incredible in this movie not only is he a completely terrifying presence but Fiennes is able to turn him into a sick human being which makes him much more interesting to watch. Like I said this film is a hard watch at times but that's ultimately one of the films greatest strengths, that it refuses to glorify the holocaust and this film has some truly disgusting moments that gives you a hint at the naive nature of humans themselves. Of course John Williams scored this film and he composed one of his finest achievements for this film. Spielberg added a very personal touch to this film with the know iconic girl in the red coat, it's a moment that is chilling to begin with but almost goes completely over your head afterwards but it's truly horrifying when it comes back later on and gives you an impression that truly nobody was safe from the grip of the Nazis. While Neeson was the one who turned Schindler into such a captivating protagonist it was also the excellent writing that made his character worth watching, he at first comes across as a complete bastard but once he gradually changes his ways it feels earned and you understand the heartbreak that Schindler goes through when he begins to realise that he may not have done enough. This film is very iconic for the fact that it was completely shot in Black and White and that's because it works so well, it gives the film and documentary style that makes it feel real. Schindlers List is a masterpiece it's has such a captivating look at humanity, it refuses to show events any way other than how they happened. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes give the greatest performances of their entire careers in this film and in my opinion should have both received Oscars for their work. A+/100%",10,10,17,1 December 2016
Amadeus," Anything But Mediocrity
","Milos Formans, 'Amadeus' is a film that for me could have had the potential to be either a fascinating insight into how a pointless rivalry destroyed the lives of two good men or an overlong bore that failed to intrigue me as I have got literally zero interest in music but I found that this film fell into the former category and found it to be fantastic. This film doesn't really have one good character to get behind, everyone has hopes and loses that you all feel, everyone is flawed and down to earth, I found myself never being able to ultimately pick one side in the film. Both characters are developed perfectly You understand just how much their music means to both of them and why they need to hold on to it, it gives a fantastic insight into there mind sets and makes them more investing as well as interesting characters. Every thing in this film production wise is fantastic all the eccentric costumes, palaces and gutters look perfect. F Murray Abraham won an Academy Award for his performance in this film and I've seen few performances more deserving he is so convincing as a conflicted man shamed with his inability to advance beyond mediocrity, he's perfect at balancing both the young idealistic and older fragile versions of his character, he always had me engaged and he was truly amazing in this movie. Tom Hulce who I have seen literally nothing else from is fantastic in this movie, he's over the top laugh, excitable tendencies yet committed nature made him an entertaining character to watch and was the perfect opposition for Abraham. It's also a very dark film to watch at times, the way in which these two men's lives begin to fall apart isn't truly heartbreaking as ,like is said, they are developed perfectly so you understand the stakes of their rivalry. But I loved that they didn't necessarily hate each other but were really jealous of each other and their eventual bond towards the end of the film made for an extremely satisfying conclusion to their arc. One of my only real issues with this movie is the love story between Mozart and his wife, it gets extremely repetitive and dull after a while and his wife was completely unlikable to I ultimately just ended up not caring at anything of her turmoil. Another issue was the present day story line with the mental asylum it was mainly he Actor who played the priest who gave a fairly bad performance, just relying on the same facial expressions to carry his portrayal and got on my nerves after a while. Amadeus is a fantastic film, it's got no one side or character to route for, everyone is perfect developed, it looks stunning in every aspect it was just the love story and some aspects of the present day story line that began to bother me at times which are only minor issues in a much more impressive picture. 88%/A-",8,0,1,14 January 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Not Up To EXpectations
","In the lead up to the release of X Men Apocalypse I was aware that there was going to be an uphill struggle coming of the back of First Class and Days of Future Past, two films that I consider to be masterpieces while this is not a bad film it's not all that great and I was very disappointed. However there is still plenty of good in this film, all the performances in this film are all still as good, James McAvoy adds a more experienced and wiser aspect to his Xavier this time around, Fassbender gives the greatest performance in this film he is such a damaged person in this film and it really added to his character motivations and arc. Oscar Isaac was really good in this film he was very menacing and sunk himself right into the character. I liked seeing all of the original characters back together as younger versions they all were fun characters who were close to their future selves. The relationship between Xavier and Eric has been a major crutch of the last two films and this one doesn't focus on it as much but when it does it's done just as well. The eventual final fight against Apocalypse was great, much more epic in scale than the other films in the franchise, the cerebral aspect of Xavier fighting Apocalypse inside his mind was brilliantly executed and the set up for Dark Phoenix was done very well. Quicksilver is back again, just as good as he was in Days of Future Past, it was nice to see him get an expanded role in this film and merged perfectly into the team. My biggest issues with this film come from the script, the films pacing is pretty awful, most of the first half is just set up for the rest of the film and did bore me quite a bit and times. Apocalypse was also not a very good villain, his motivations were extremely conventional, his powers were never fleshed out and his suit was terrible. All the villains except for Magneto are just throw away thugs essentially who add nothing to the plot of this film. The cameo from Wolverine itself was amazing to see but you get the hint that the entire strikers island sequence was done just for that cameo. In terms of spectacle, visuals and performances this film is brilliant but the script was this films major downfall, it's pacing is terrible, the villains are bland with no real motivation and fails to build on and improve plot threads and character developments that were set up in the past films. 69%/B-",6,0,1,13 January 2017
Ex Machina," Fantastically Phycological and Thought Provoking
","I had no idea what to expect walking into this film I couldn't really think of any movie like it and after watching it this was a fantastic film with some excellent views on humanity itself. The whole plot of the Turing Test is the perfect plot device for this film the conversations between Gleeson and Vikander are so good it brings up some really intelligent arguments and views with some unexpectedly frightening and intense moments. For this entire movie you have no clue what to think or who trust, since this is such a claustrophobic movie it makes this film into such an intense experience. Alicia Vikander was so amazing in this movie, she was able to make Ava into a complex character and make her feel like more that just a robot, I haven't yet seen her performance in The Danish Girl but I honestly think that this performance was 100% Oscar Worthy. Oscar Isaac is just unrecognisable in this film, his character is such a strange one you never really know what to think of him but you know that he's impossible to trust. Domhnall Gleeson was good in this movie but I had a few issues with his character that I will expand upon. The special effects for Ava were incredible they look so life like and theirs never a moment were they don't look real. Before this film I don't think I had really seen anything else from Alex Garland but this film proves to me that he's a force to be reckoned with he did a fantastic job directing this film he did give this film a very slow pace but that worked for this movie as it added to the intense nature of the film and because this is such an intriguing film you never bored by it. Like I said, I did have a few issues with Gleesons character I didn't really find him that interesting a protagonist, the script makes all these big claims about him being so impressive but you never really see any one them with your own eyes. Another flaws comes from the last five minutes it's a flaw that has been repeated a lot but there's a moment at the end that just doesn't really make any sense as to how a certain helicopter pilot wasn't a bit more suspicious and I really thought they could have come up with a better way of getting around such a blatant plot hole. Ex Machina has all the hallmarks of a great sci-if film, its incredibly intriguing, the performances are all fantastic with Vikander being especially good, it's got some intriguing view on life itself and is an extremely intense experience. 83%/A-",8,1,3,26 November 2016
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Not A Masterpiece But Ambitious and Beautiful
","When I first saw this movie I didn't know what to think about it, I knew that I loved all the performances and loved the message with time to think on it I still stick to those statements but recognise that it does have some flaws with its final act and some character development. But first are the positives Brad Pitt is amazing in this movie and I honestly wouldn't have blamed him if he couldn't quite nail it because this is a next to impossible performance but he pulls it of beautifully with both the way he walks and talks in his younger (older?) years but he's also able to portray the characters child like innocence to perfection and it's by far his best performance since Fight Club. Cate Blanchett is also really good in this movie she's got a really nice arc to her that goes from a hateful and cruel hearted character to a sympathetic one with great chemistry with Brad Pitt that makes there eventual romance earned. Taraji P. Henson was also amazing in this movie she's got such a likability to her you that you always believe that she's loves Benjamin. The make up and prosthetic are incredible, there life like and that combined with Pitts performance never makes you think that there fake. This movie looks beautiful the cinematography is incredible from the snowy waters in the trap steamer scenes to the beautiful New Orleans sunshine. This movie spans about 70 years from 1918 to the early 90s and the production design is astonishing every new location and time period brings something new and is its always easy to believe the time period that they are in. There are some truly incredible scenes in this movie for instance the opening which might just be my favourite scene in any David Fincher film it's just perfectly done from the editing, directing and some of the best extra performances I've ever scene it just sets up the movie perfectly and establishes a perfect metaphor for the film as a whole. David Fincher finally received his first Best Director Oscar Nomination in this movie and its very well deserved he directed this film masterfully from some of the more intense action sequences to the quieter more character and performance driven scenes. Every thing in this movie from a technical and performance driven stand is perfect but this films greatest shortcoming is its script. Like I said there are some truly amazing scenes and sequences were the righting is on point but I do think they lost that in the films final act. Some of the decisions that the characters make don't feel earned and just came out of nowhere and big scenes are montages over instead of some real time being taken to close out the film properly. I do love Brad Pitt as Benjamin Button but his character isn't really that well written there's no real character arc from him. When he meets new people and travels around the world theirs not really anything that he takes away from his experiences and the character doesn't really get a true conclusion. I really do like this movie I love aspects of it but others I do not, but I admire it's Ambition and its performances and it overall makes up for some serious flaws. A-/83%",8,0,1,5 November 2016
1917," A Technical Achievement In Film Making
","Sam Mendes is one of my favourite directors working today so that alone made me excited for 1917. That excitement only increased after the one-shot approach was announced. The coming together of this Director, approach, setting and Cinematographer convinced me this film was going to be something special and i truly could not have loved it more. I truly believe this film will be remembered as a landmark in film making and I cannot wait to see it again.Technically speaking this film is jaw dropping. The one shot approach never feels tedious or over done but instead completely immersive. Because of this, the tension is only exploited more. It truly feels like a 3 man mission, with the viewer feeling like the 3rd person in this mission. This is due to Sam Mendes gorgeous direction but also Roger Deakins spectacular cinematography. His work in this film is truly stunning no matter what setting the film takes, he truly deserves his second Oscar for this film and cannot see the academy not giving it to him.George MacKay And Dean-Charles Chapman both carry this movie wonderfully, I've seen other work from both actors before but this is truly the best I've ever seen both of them. Their chemistry is on point and there are plenty of subtle moments that build their characters. I truly hope to see more from both of them in the future. The rest of the Supporting cast play fairly small roles but all worked perfectly for what they needed to achieve. Richard Madden And Benedict Cumberbatch probably stand out the most as they both come into play at the end of the film and pay off in what we were expecting to see from them.I truly loved how this film portrayed its setting. It doesn't feel like it conforms to the usual cliches found in other war films. It conveys the horrible conditions of war and the constant fear of death in ways I haven't seen enough from other films of this type. I found myself latching onto the characters because the writing had made them so human and relatable. As cheesy as it sounds you do truly feel like a participant in this war during the 2 hours you spend with these characters.1917 is a masterpiece and very possible the best film of 2019. Mendes' one-shot, vision is truly realised to perfect effect and feels immersive like no other film before it. Roger Deakins stunning work in this film truly makes it feel as if no one else could have pulled of the cinematography to this level of perfection. The films gives us just enough character development to care about everyone involved. The film puts you into World War One for the 2 hours it has you and I wouldn't have had it any other way.10/10 - A+ (Incredible)",10,0,1,12 January 2020
Lincoln," Spielberg Delivers A Dialogue Driven Yet Riveting Biopic
",Most people will be aware that Steven Spielbergs filmography can be split into to two categories Action Adventures and Real Life Dramas and Lincoln falls into the latter categories but that's no disservice to the film as I think this is a fantastic film with amazing performances and a riveting story. When you boil it down the thing that are going to make or break this movie are the performances and they all work especially Daniel Day-Lewis who gives one of the best performances I have ever seen he embodies everything that Abraham Lincoln stood for and delivers a performance that is impossible not to get behind and it is easy to tell that the set backs in what he is trying to accomplish are taking a toll on him. Tommy Lee Jones also killed it in this movie I loved every second of his screen time he just seemed like an alternative version of Lincoln. Every thing Lincoln could be if he showed no restraint. The story of this movie is done in a very compelling way just do using in Lincolns last few months in office bringing the story into focus. James Spader was also extremely entertaining in this movie I loved his entire sub-plot of trying to get votes for the amendment and truly stole every scene he was in (except from any scene he had with Day-Lewis). Spielberg directs the film in a way to ensures that the audience is never bored and he doesn't do it in a lazy way by cutting the camera constantly he ensures that something visually interesting is always happening on screen. However my only flaw with this movie is the fact that we never truly saw with our own eyes what Lincoln was fighting for we never see slaves suffering and begging for freedom in fact most of the slaves seen in the movie are treated reasonably well. Of course I understand why one would want to end slavery I just think I would have made for some more compelling scenes in the film. Lincoln is one of my favourite Steven Spielberg movies with amazing performance and a compelling and riveting story. A-91%,9,4,6,14 October 2016
Black Hawk Down," One of Ridleys Best Efforts
","Ridley Scott is an amazing director with over 3 decades worth of movies to his name and Black Hawk Down is not only one of my favourite war films it's also one of my favourite Movies by Ridley Scott. For one despite the fact that the story being told in this movie is quite gruesome and ugly it's very entertaining I could watch this movie anytime it's able to honour to suffering of its characters while still being able to entertain the viewer and make them want to come back and watch the movie multiple times. The way they tell the story is by just showing the brutality of war not putting focus on a romance or one character in particular but showing them all just showing what the war has done to these men and the people they are trying to protect. This is one of the best directed movies I have ever seen it cuts at just the right moments the framing is perfect the action sequences are all perfectly handled and should have gotten Ridley Scott an Oscar for his efforts. While you probably couldn't tell all the characters apart the actors who play them all given terrific performances with Ewan McGregor and William Fichner probably being the standouts. You've still got Tom Hardy here in one of his earliest roles he's not in the movie for long but does the best with his limited screen time and the same goes for Orlando Bloom. My next point is one that is both a positive and a negative for the movie, the lack of character development. This adds a bit to the movie for what Scott is trying to accomplish he just wants to show the brutality of war and having to spend time developing its many characters would subtracts from that greatly. But it detracts from the movie as well as this movie has got a lot of characters and because of there lack of development as I previously said you can't really tell them apart. If your hoping for subtlety Black Hawk Down is not the movie for your u but if you love War movies or just Entertaining movies Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down is definitely the movie for you it's one of his finest films and one of the many for which he will be remembered for.

Silence," Martin Scorsese's Schindlers List (Though Not Without Its Flaws)
","When I sent to see this film in the theatres about halfway through the man in front of me got up blocking my view and I got such a shock because I had been focused on the screen for so long because this is a film that always grips your attention and holds its through its fantastic performances, intense sequences and smooth directions. I loved the fact that this is a film that Martin Scorsese chose to do this movie because it shows his range as a director as he did such a good job directions this film he used a lot of long takes even during the hardest scenes to watch that helped to give the film a greater impact on me. The cinematography in this film is also stunning everything from the sunny hills to the fog filled pits look nothing less than life like. Andrew Garfield has easily become one of my favourite actors working today, while Hacksaw Ridge doesn't get released in my country for another few weeks I've heard nothing but good things about his performance but in this film he easily gives the greatest performance of his entire career through his performance we very clearly see the gradual breakdown of his character and his suffering was easily easily conveyed through Garfield. Liam Neeson makes his return to drama in this film and while he wasn't in this film much he definitely did a fantastic job while he was there. This film asks a lot of questions about faith and people's interpretations of god and there is a lot of division to the subject and everyone who believes in something or holds a belief in this movie is always convincing, you never take just one side in this movie and the viewers ability to do that better illustrates the struggle of Garfields character. But I can't say this film is flawless for one Adam Driver while very good in this film doesn't get a lot do To he doesn't have much screen time so ends up suffering from a lack of characterisation. Martin Scorsese is known for using a lot of narration in his movies and it usually works but here I found it to be over used at times in scenes where just silence would be more effective. Another Scorsese trade mark is a very long runtime but again here it doesn't always work as I found the ending of this film to be very drawn out to unnecessary levels. While I don't quite thinks it's Scorsese's best I do think that it will go down as one of his most ambitious projects. Silence is definitely going to get a few Academy Award nominations for acting and technical qualities. While this isn't a film I'm going to rush to see again it's definitely one that I'm not going to forget any time soon. 73%/B",7,1,5,3 January 2017
Logan," The Legacy of A Legend
","Logan isn't really what I'd call a superhero movie it's more of a neo-western meets a road trip movie meets a family drama and it worked exceptionally. I was not as excited for this movie as much as everyone else, the trailers just weren't truly speaking to me but the final product absolutely did and is one of the most bittersweet movies I've ever viewed. The direction they took the character of Logan in this film was not something I had expected, we've seen him at his absolute lows and his points where he was truly without hope but never like this, we've never seen him suicidal with absolutely nothing left to fight for and it made his arc in the film all the more satisfying. To see him Ben forced back into helping someone one last time but in himself old and weakened state was at times hard to watch but at the same time very captivating knowing that this truly is his last fight. Another character who's direction surprised me with the direction that they took was that of Charles Xavier, to see someone we've seen be a beacon of hope and an inspirational figure as a now weak and frail old man was not what I signed on for when I started watching this movie but i greatly admired what they did here, to see him in a light we've never seen before truly showed us that this film was going to be different. As much as I was excited to see Hugh Jackman play his signature role for the final time I was saddened by the fact I would never see him take up the claws again but Jackman absolutely nailed it one final time. He brought a real harshness, sickly and vulnerable presence to this performance in both a physical and a emotional way, he truly gave one of the greatest performances ever in a comic book movie. The same can be said for Patrick Stewart one gave such a heartbreaking performance that often left me saddened yet captivated by the complete commitment to his final performance as this character. Newcomer Dafne Keen absolutely held her own in this movie in a very physical performance match with her great chemistry with Jackman and Stewart. I've never been an advocate of R-Rated comic book films, or for any film really, I just don't like the idea of needless violence and excessive language being put into a film needlessly but I truly loved how this film used its R-Rating. It made truly apparent that this was different from any of the other films in the franchise, it made it feel much more gritty and real and allowed director James Mangold to take the action to its full extent by fully exploiting the capabilities of the titular characters powers, this film is plenty bloody and violent but is used as a tool to show the reality of the situation for its characters and against all my worries was not something I found to be an unnecessary addition to this film. Like I said this film isn't like other comic book movies, it has a real slowness to it as well as a good heart and grit. Plenty of scenes are devoted to simply interaction among characters and their conversations all of which feel like valuable conclusions and added something to this movie. Is definitely one of the more slow paced films of this franchise but never feels boring or uninteresting as it's full of characters we've come to know and love which makes it feel more valuable knowing that it is there final few hours of screen time. I don't think this is a perfect movie, I did have a few issues with it. For one the villains, I really enjoyed Boyd Holbrook in this movie he was a very charismatic character he wasn't very deep but he had a nice presence to him that made him enjoyable as a character. The same cannot be said for Xander Rice or The Reavers, I found them to be extremely conventional and generic. The Reavers were expendable foot soldiers who only served to see Jackman and Keen in full R-Rated fashion. Rice was a fairly bland character who had iffy motivations and didn't really do anything of consequence on screen. I also found the last act to be a bit mixed, now the last 10 minutes were incredibly, extremely emotionally fulfilling material, but before that felt very rushed, as if the filmmakers had established so many plot lines that they desperately needed to wrap up before the film ended. I didn't particularly care for the new characters they introduced here and felt like a bit an underwhelming addition. While it's not my favourite if the X-Men franchise it is most definitely the most emotionally satisfying and fulfilling. It had a nice heart and message, fantastic action, performances and character arcs that truly wrapped up the character of Wolverine in a masterful fashion that made me realise just how much a cherish the characters of the franchise and how much I'll miss them now that they time is at an end. 8.8/10: A- (Fantastic)",8,5,11,6 August 2017
The Insider," Michael Manns Best Film With Career Best Performances
","For me personally I've always been a bit off and on with Michael Mann what few films I've seen from him I'm not a big fan (even Heat) but I was still desperate to see The Insider and now haven seen this masterpiece I will always give him credit as The Insider is now one of my all time favourite movies with amazing performances. The characters in this movie are incredibly investing because Mann doesn't paint them as perfect they're all making mistakes and screwing up which makes them seem more human. Russell Crowe is absolutely amazing in this movie with Gladiator also being one of my favourite movies I wasn't sure if I'd ever see a better performance from him but here he is just as good not only is his accent convincing but the toll taken on him is perfectly conveyed through his masterful performance. Al Pacino is every bit his equal he perfectly conveys his no nonsense, experienced character making you believe that no one else could have played this part. The tension in this movie is done just right every time Crowe puts his (or his families) safety on the line you feel it you are worried as to what the company is going to do to him next. Is also a very interesting film, to see all the ways in which Crowe and Pacino are trying to combat Big Tobacco using the law in very specific way and it further enthuses Pacino's experience and Crowes vulnerability. When things do go Crowes way you feel it the writing in this movie is so good that you are desperate for Crowe to succeed because overall you see that he just wants to do the right thing. I absolutely adore The Insider it's suspenseful and heartbreaking and in many ways also uplifting it's got some Career best performances and makes me desperate to see more films from Michael Mann.100%-A+",10,7,7,20 October 2016
The Dark Knight," Not Only The Way The Way To Do Superhero Movies But Movies in General
",If I ever meet Christopher Nolan in real life I will not leave without shaking his hand not only for this movie but all the ones he's made because The Dark Knight is the best superhero movie ever made and one of the best ever made. Ever character in this movie has very clear motivations and a seriously good character arc making you care about what happens to them even in some cases with the films villain The Joker played Incredibly by Heath Ledger possibly giving the greatest performance of all time. He is just so terrifying and mysterious making sure he steals the whole movie. Christian Bale continues to be a fantastic Batman giving a very complex and emotional performance. Despite all the emotion and drama The Dark Knight is also incredibly entertaining there is not any time of day that I wouldn't want to watch this movie and that's how you know you've made a masterpiece when you can give the viewer something to think about while still being able to entertain them. The conversations between Batman and The Joker are masterful making for some of the best Hero-Villain confrontations of all time and just leaves you on edge and terrified until the final fight between them. The Dark Knight is a masterpiece of cinema it just does absolutely everything right making the greatest superhero movie of all time and still makes me wonder if anyone will ever top this movie. 100%-A+,10,1,2,12 June 2016
Elysium," A Very Underrated Movie With A Few Story Flaws
","Say what you want about Neil Blomkamp but you can't help but admire the passion he puts into his movies it's so great to see a writer and director making original Sci-Fi movies today and I really enjoyed Elysium and thought that it was extremely underrated. I loved the world that set up to feels real as other than some of the space travel aspects they keep thing plausible and explainable by science. The special effects in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen to the point where they feel so real and part of the natural environment. Neil Blomkamp has been controversial as a writer but you can't help but praise this mans skill behind the camera because he directs this movie beautifully. The performances are also terrific in this movie especially Matt Damon and Shartlo Copley the reason Matt Damon is so good in this movie is because he's very grounded in this movie he gives a very venerable and angry performance and because of this like the world Blomkamp created it feels real. But by far my favourite performance in this movie is what that I legitimately felt deserved an Academy Award nomination, Shartlo Copley he was so good here his characters is so vile and disgusting but you can't help but just want to see him back on screen and Copley plays his characters flaws by not holding anything back creating a terrifying and unpredictable performance. However while I do think Elysium is underrated I still have to admit it has some flaws for one Jodie Foster is pretty bad in this movie her performance just doesn't feel real like everything else and her ridiculous accent just didn't work and was extremely Annoying. Another issues had was with the Frey character she just didn't add anything to this movie and like Foster was very annoying. The set up for the world was far to brief and vague I would have like people to have seen a more detailed back story as it would have added to the plot and maybe made the conflict even better than it already was. Elysium gets way to much hate seeing as people are still crying out for original movies this was one of my favourite movies of 2013 and I really hope Blomkamp keeps making movies while taking on some of the criticisms from this movie and Chappie. 87%-A-",8,3,5,1 July 2016
Avatar," A Movie With Too Much Hate That Deserves More Appreciation
","Over the years James Cameron's, Avatar has become an extremely controversial movie with some people calling it groundbreaking and a masterpiece and some calling it an overlong and derivative bore. I find myself not completely agreeing with either side but I do believe that it's got far to much um warranted hate. The main hate from this movie comes from that fact that it's got a few blatant similarities to other movies and it's probably this films greatest short coming but it doesn't kill the films it got far to much good in it for it to be considered bad. But one other slight negative with the film is the fact that Sam Worthington is a but bland in this film he just never really stands out or does anything other than what he's required to. But Zoe Saldana is amazing in this film she just completely invests herself in this character and is the greatest motion capture performance since Andy Serkis in Lord of The Rings. The one thing that no one can call derivative in this film is the world of Pandora it is incredible the landscapes look incredible and the Nav'i look incredible they're culture is interesting and entertaining to watch grow. The action sequences look amazing and you feel the scale of these two races fighting each other only through Cameron's direction. In all honesty there's nothing particularly special about Stephen Langs villain but he's incredibly entertaining and holds his own in the battle scenes. I hate the fact that so many people have turned on this movie when James Cameron so clearly poured his heart and soul into it. It looks incredible and has mostly great performances and is truly a movie that (even though similar to others) is like nothing I've ever seen before. 89%-A-",8,5,6,20 October 2016
Invictus," A Solid Yet Unbearably Slow Drama
","Sports are not my thing I've never been into them and find them boring, yet when I first heard about this movie I was extremely curious to seem if I could get over that an s for the most part I did I found this to be a very good film despite some major pacing issues. But by far the best thing about this movie are the performances from Damon and Freeman who both deservedly earned Oscar nominations for this movie, Morgan Freeman was so good in this movie not only was his accent extremely convincing but he also nailed the emotional turmoil that Mandela was going through your able to get completely behind him and Freemans performance was just overall inspiring. Matt Damon gives one of the greatest performances of his entire career in this film, he has a great parallel to Freeman and you get a sense of the similarities between them, Damon was great in the rugby scenes and also great and conveying how desperately he wanted to lead his team to victory and said like Freeman you were very easily able to get behind him. I never thought I could feel such intensity from a rugby match by my god I was on edge during every second of them because they take their time to build up the importance of winning this match and makes it all the more satisfying to watch. The relationships between the South Africans in this movie was a pleasure to watch it was done perfectly you understood all that these two peoples had been through and watching them gradually come to trust each other was fascinating and satisfying. However there are some flaws with this film and it's mainly the excruciatingly slow pace it works for the rugby scenes but outside that it's just makes scenes drag in majorly and it did bore me at time and make me just want them to get back to the rugby. This film also does lack some subtlety characters just seem to immediately say what their thinking instead of conveying it through a performance despite the fact that they could have used some of the dragged out scenes to build up some more investment. Invictus is far from a perfect movie but it has very good intentions, this film has two excellent performances from Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, well directed rugby scenes, a great political and racial story and some truly inspiring scenes. 78%/B+",7,0,1,17 November 2016
The Last Samurai," A Masterpiece with Amazing Themes or Honor and Friendship
","When I think of movies that critics have undervalued Edward Zwicks The Last Samurai always comes to mind because I absolutely adore this movie and it contains some of the best performances I've ever seen. Tom Cruise is completely Oscar worthy in this movie he perfectly portrays his traumatised war veteran and really makes you care about him every step of the way. Ken Watanabe is every bit Cruises equal he is so sympathetic and interesting to watch and your just begging that he will ultimately succeed in his cause. The great thing about this movie is the fact that it chooses to focus on the friendship between the two main characters instead of the battle scenes. It gives the film a greater meaning and a deeper message so that your not bored in between the action sequences, which by the way are incredible to watch. The entire second act of this movie is my favourite section of the movie because it gives you a chance to really delve into these characters and builds gradually to the final battle. It's heartwarming to see Cruise gradually build a connection with these people. The final battle is incredible it puts you right in there with the characters and puts you on the edge of your seat. The final scene between Algren and Katsumoto is just beautiful, few times have the editing, score, acting and directing all come together so perfectly and leaves my eyes pouring every time I watch this movie.The Last Samurai could have been a simple war movie but proves itself to be much more than that with amazing performances and great themes that has become one of my all time favourite movies and deserved much more credit than critics gave it.

Reservoir Dogs," Tarantinos Humble Beginnings
","Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest directors of the last few decades, he seamlessly blends dialogue with brutal violence in his films which are always compelling and extremely entertaining, while is do not think this is his best film Reservoir Dogs is a fantastic opening to his filmography. The dialogue in this film is absolutely perfect, it makes the film feel genuine, characters talk about random things that don't always have relevance to the plot but it feels like what real people would do in this situation which makes this film feel real. Another thing that feels real in this film is the violence, this is an extremely bloody movie but not to an excessive level it helps to establish the dangers these characters are presented with and gives the film a grittier edge. This film always had me engaged, Tarantino perfectly built up this central mystery perfectly it keeps you guessing for the entire run time and your more than likely to change your mind at least once. All the performances in this film are fantastic with the standouts probably being Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel, Roths character is in pretty much excruciating pain for most of the film and he's never not convincing, your always convinced that he is in as much pain as he says he is and it was just brutal to watch. All the characters have amazing interaction in this Film they're all set up as very different people which makes them more interesting to watch together. This film is told in a non linear fashion and for the most part it worked, it helped to establish the mystery and the characters better but they didn't always work for me, a lot of them show how the characters came to be on this job but I felt that the film contradicted itself by doing this, it's established that all of them are mysterious figures with no backstory so telling us this was just an odd choice and honestly they just didn't add much to this film. I also don't feel the pull to re watch this film like Tarantinos other films but I think that's just me. I really did like this movie it's got amazing characters and performances, it's never anything less than engaging, the mystery is established perfectly and like most of a Tarantinos films, the characters were ultimately what made this film worth the watch.85%/A-",8,0,0,11 January 2017
Les Misérables," Do You Hear The Critics Sing?
","When thinking of my least favourite genres Horror and Musicals come to mind, so as you can imagine I wasn't exactly ecstatic to see this film but I ended up very impressed with one of the better musicals I've seen in my life. I think for the most part this film was very impressive, it's not without its flaws but found this film to be very much worth the watch. When Tom Hooper won the Oscar for The Kings Speech the only thing that really bothered me about that was the fact that it didn't really put his talents on full display but their front and centre here, all the musical numbers and character direction is perfect, it really did make you believe the dire situation that these characters lived in and it truly proved to me his talent as a director. Hugh Jackman was absolutely brilliant in this film, not only is his singing voice fantastic but he carried a real burden and shame with him that Jackman perfectly portrayed. Few performances limited performances have impressed as much as Anne Hathaway in this film, her absolute emotional destruction was perfectly conveyed through her performance and created for some truly emotionally tragic scenes. When I hear bad things about Russell Crowes performance all I can do is scratch my head, I thought he was amazing in this film, he was a true antagonist who was not all the different from Valjean and I though Crowe brought true complexity to the character. This film also looks stunning, all the French streets, dirty alleys and poverty ridden areas truly gave out an impression that truly hooked me. But I don't think this film base some issues for one, after the first 20 minutes the film failed to really grip or interest me, it slowed the film down completely and seemed to spend to much time devoted to setting up the final act rather than give a compelling narrative of its own. The run time is also a bit excessive and the pacing drags quite a lot for me. Also seeing as it is a film called, The Miserable it's got a lot of really sad scenes that while obviously need to be there just don't make me want to go back and watch it again. Everything from a technical and performance standpoint in this film is incredible, it's one of the best looking films in recent memory, while there's not a whole lot to drag me back to watch this again it's definitely a film worth watching that truly leaves an impression. 8.1/10: A- (Fantastic)",8,2,3,27 January 2017
Titanic," A Film Like No Other
","James Camerons, Titanic is a film that everyone knows about and one that every movie fan will have to watch at some point and it's worth such praise as I found this to be a fantastic film with one of the best romances ever put to screen. By far the most admirable thing about this movie is the fact that it never drags despite being over three hours long that because they use every scene to fullest to either increase the chemistry between Jack and Rose or to get attached to the characters you know are doomed. The title ship looks incredible in this movie everything from the lower cabins to the luxurious cigar rooms look nothing less than life like. This first and foremost is a love story and that works for this movie it helps to give the eventual tragedy more weight to it and there's not a single second where you don't believe either of these to people aren't in love. You just feel like they belong with each other and need each other and it takes two exceptional performances to capture that. Leonardo DiCaprio is just perfect casting in this films he's incredibly likable and entertaining and hate to see him trampled over by the first class passengers. Kate Winslet though gave the best performance in this film you feel that despite the fact that she has infinite riches she feels completely alone and she portrays that perfectly and her final scenes with Jack are absolutely heartbreaking to watch. The final hour of Titanic is centred around the sinking of the ship and never have Tension and Desperation been captured quite like this every single scene brings a new obstacle or challenge and just gradually seeing the water rise adds to the tension all the more. There's a lot of scenes in this film where characters are only looking out for themselves and are leaving others behind to die but you don't hate them for it (except Cal) you understand their desperation and will to survive and the viewer has to face the fact that they would likely to things very similar in the same situation. This is however not a perfect movie it does have some flaws, for one a lot of the side characters, specifically the first class passengers, just have nothing to them their just their to be hate able and to give more obstacles for Jack and Rose to cross and more could have been done with them. I also think that their was no need to focus so much on the present day storyline it takes up to much time toward the beginning and should have kept all these scenes until the ending of the film and could've still had the same impact. Don't get me wrong this film is a commitment, it's not a causal watch but is still a unique one. It's got an amazing central romance and had some excellent directing and some of the best production design ever put to film. 86%/A-",8,1,2,30 October 2016
The Departed," Scorsese' Best Movie and DiCaprios Best Performance
",Despite having four decades worth of competition The Departed in my opinion is the greatest movie Martin Scorsese has ever made because it does everything that movie needs to be good and much more. Leonardo DiCaprio was simply incredible in this movie it's not only his best performance but it's one of the best of all time as there is a story on his face and a variety of emotions with every new scene. The film also have layers upon layers of tension in every scene making it truly unpredictable right up until the very end. While out shined by DiCaprio the rest of the cast give fantastic Performances particularly Matt Damon who also gives the best performance of his career. While it's always going to bug me that Mark Walberg was the only actor in this movie to be nominated for an Oscar he was still fantastic and was the comic relief of the film. The film is quite simply directed perfectly channelling the chaotic and unstable themes of the film ensured Scorsese his best director Oscar. This is one of my favourite movies of all time and it truly is a masterpiece.,10,0,2,3 June 2016
Zero Dark Thirty," Solid But Some What Overrated
","Zero Dark Thirty was a film that I has heard quite a lot about, I'd heard people saying that it deserved Best Picture and was one of the greatest films of the century and I have to say that I agree with neither but still think this is still a solid film that offers real insight into the shocking methods taken to assassination Osmaa Bin Laden. Immediately my favourite thing about this movie was Jessica Chastain's performance, she was amazing in this film she started out as a real amateur who struggled with the methods she was forced to take in order to achieve her mission to a bold person willing to do anything to real her goal no matter the personal cost. Jason Clarke was really good in this film, he perfectly carried a few very disturbing scenes and really pulled off his experience and comfort in his methods. Another thing I really loved about this film was how realistic and gritty it was, there's no action in this film that feels like a film but more life like this is mostly due to Kathryn Bigelows direction. In her last film, The Hurt Locker, some of her techniques didn't work and pulled me out of the experience but she does away with a lot of that in this film and gives us real intensity, stakes and consequences. This film is hard to watch at times mainly due to the brutally disturbing torture scenes but it's admirable they chose to show the whole picture and not just make the Americans out as the good guys. The final sequence in this film which depicts the assassination of Bin Laden in technical terms was done perfectly, the lighting was fantastic as it made it feel more realistic, the action was gritty and intense, it was done really well and didn't feel out of place as it could have given as the actual events happened during the filming of the movie. However there are in my opinion so glaring issues with this film, mainly it's the massive lack of character development in the supporting characters, Chastian is developed perfectly and we understand her motivations but no one else gets that treatment so when terrible things happens to them the effects are lessened. Like I said technically the assassination is done perfectly but in some ways it wasn't particularly satisfying, his death is completely glossed over in a second and it actually took me a second to realise it has happened. In my opinion, compared to Argo, that deserved Best Picture but despite the fact that I'll probably never go back and watch this film again I thought it was a really interesting watch, Jessica Chastain was amazing in the film, its very realistic and gritty, it offers some real insight into the steps taken to kill Bin Laden despite some character development issues I found this to be much better than The Hurt Locker and would recommend it to anyone interested in real life drama. 7.9/10: B+ (Solid)",7,0,1,15 January 2017
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Non-Stop Entertainment Despite Lacking in Certain Areas
","Milos Formans, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Next is a film that relys on its characters in the best possible way, it doesn't take them too seriously but Strikes the perfect balance in them between light hearted and at some times dark, I do not consider this film to be a masterpiece but I still think it is one of the most unique I've ever seen. I really mean that, there was not one second of this movie where I was not entertained like I said mainly due to the characters and there interactions, they use the patients mental difficulties to its advantage to make for a lot of hilarious dark comedy. I could not have imagined a better choice to play the lead in this film than Jack Nicholson, there is not for scene where he is unconvincing as this character, he knows just when to go a little over the top but never does it to ridiculous levels. Louise Fletcher was so fantastic in this film she was so utterly despicable in this film, the way she played with the patients and manipulated them for almost her own entertainment is so frustrating to watch, I do have a few issues with the character but Fletchers performance was all but flawless. But in my opinion this films most underrated and best performance is from Bard Dourif he was absolutely amazing in this film, his stutter and lack of confidence made him such a sympathetic character, he has so many great scenes with Nicholson and ended up being this films most tragic character. I also love that the other mental patients aren't just there for comedic relief their very well developed characters who all have reasons for their predicaments. I also loved the battle between MacMurphy and Nurse Ratched was not only hilarious but above all just satisfying to see the Nurse gradually lose control of the people's she's used as pawns for so long. But I do have a few issues with this film and my biggest is that Nurse Ratched while great as a hate able antagonist, she doesn't really get much development, she's really just there to be an evil presence to be tortured by Nicholson. Another thing that I really didn't like about this film was that it was ultimately style over substance I'm not saying that it didn't work for this film I just think it would have made the film just a bit more satisfying to watch if there was some kind of message behind it. I think that this is a fantastic film it's constant entertainment, Nicholson, Fletcher and Dourif where all amazing in this film, it never takes itself to seriously and all the characters where used in perfect ways. 83%/A-",8,1,3,12 January 2017
Whiplash," A Powerful Film That Anyone Can Relate To
","First thing to know before reading this review: I am not a fan of music, I have never seen the appeal of it and have never been a musician, but despite that I loved this movie, mainly because it's not just a movie about music, it's a movie about a man trying to find his place in life and everything that gets in his way. The way in which this film explore, dreams and ambitions is what makes this movie relatable because we've all had passions in our lives, things we've wanted to achieve and the way this film addresses that is beautiful and allows us to get behind the main character more. Miles Teller as Andrew in this movie gives the greatest performance of his entire career, not only is he excellent in the drumming scenes but he was also great at portraying his characters drive to be the best and his inner demons and struggles. But really JK Simmons performance stole this movie. Simmons won The Academy Award For Best Supporting Actor for this film and I've seen few performances more deserving of such an Honor, he's absolutely terrifying in this movie, but he doesn't just rely on some quick dialogue and one liners to carry his performance, the character is also a deep one, while you never agree with his actions you understand why he goes to such extreme lengths to motivate his students. I also was surprised at how much I loved the romance in this movie, the love story is a way for us to see how much drumming is effecting Tellers character and I also thought Melissa Beniost was really good in this film. You wouldn't think it but this movie is incredibly intense mainly because of Simmons amazing performance but because you understand the stakes of getting every note and key right. Few movies have had a more perfect ending than this one, the stakes are high but thanks to the perfectly developed characters and everything coming full circle the physiological warfare that goes on between these two characters comes to a perfect and satisfying end that left me in amazement. I only have a few flaws with this film and is mainly some of the minor characters they're just horrible people for no reason and tear Andrew down just for the sake of it and they could have been given more depth. Whiplash is a fantastic film, it does everything perfectly from a performance and character perspective and has a great way of appealing to anyone who has ever had any kind of ambition and I think this film will one day become a classic.

The Wolf of Wall Street," Scorsese' Funniest movie ever and the best one of 2013
","I Have Loved every Scorsese-DiCaprio collaboration and while it definitely doesn't live up to The Departed and Gangs of New York it's is still and incredible laugh riot throughout with amazing direction and writing. DiCaprio recently won the Oscar for his role in the Revenant and to be honest he should have one for this movie instead as he gives an absolutely amazing performance as Jordan Belford who in reality is a piece of sh*t but he is a very entertaining character and steals the entire movie. Jonah Hill also gives the performance of his career with Donnie Azoff. The Wolf of Wall Street is also very entertaining which is surprising for a movie like this, but it really is particularly when Belford is addressing his employees and it's really quite inspiring and proves he does have some humanity to him. Another very good Scorsese film, Casino while fantastic relied far to much on narration to tell a story but The Wolf of Wall Street doesn't have that problem DiCaprio addressed the audience and it helped them enjoy the movie even more as it put them in the situation. Like I said this movie is absolutely hilarious for example the drug sequence featuring DiCaprio and Hill will leave you on the ground struggling the breath but it isn't all laughs and giggles this movie definitely has its dark moments when near the end of the film his wife (played extremely well by Margot Robbie) asks for a divorce and Jordan loses it and beats her then starts taking drugs leading to his daughter being injured. It's admirable that Scorsese chose not to ignore this, Belford was not a good person and this scene highlights that. With a movie that is 3 hours long it is perfectly paced very fast with just enough moment for you to breathe in between. Scorsese has outdone himself again and created in my opinion the best movie of 2013 and leaves me really wanting to see more of DiCaprio and Scorsese collaborations.",10,1,4,15 March 2016
American Gangster," Ridley Scott's Own Take on A Proved Genre
","One of the things I love most about Ridley Scott is his willingness to try everything, he's tried his hand at almost every genre in his career and while it's hasn't always workout for him I always admire the effort. But I don't just have to admire the effort here because I loved this movie, it's one of Ridley Scott's best and one of the greatest movies of 2007. A large part of that is due to its two central characters. I loved the character of Frank Lucas in this film he was so captivating I loved seeing his arc and business acumen and is by far one of Denzel Washingtons best and most complex performances. Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott are great together I loved Crowes character because again he was a complex one I loved seeing him want more than what he had and I loved the scenes between these two characters. The world of Harlem in this movie just sucks you right in you immediately see what kind of place this is and see what's been done to it by people like Lucas. Another thing I loved about this movie was the fact that everything had consequences, we see with our own eyes the fallout of Lucas' dealings and make him a more well rounded character. I think this movie has some of the best uses of violence in a movie because it's used to enhance the story, the extra blood or close ups of drug ridden dead bodies sucks us into the atmosphere more. I also really liked Josh Brolin in this movie I thought his character added something to this movie his story arc of being a corrupt police officer paralleled very nicely with Crowes head strong, good-cop arc and added to the bleak atmosphere Scott was trying to create. other characters I loved seeing were Lucas' brother it set up a nice dynamic between them, it's was good to see them get sucked into this world and I thought it added to Washingtons character to see him slowly isolate everyone he loves and creates for some really disturbing sequences. If I have one flaw with this movie it would be that it's definitely similar in terms of style and tone to other Gangster flicks but if it works for what To filmmakers are trying to accomplish and it does just that then I'm fine with that for the most part but the only area I thought this didn't quite work for was the love story I just didn't think it added anything to this film and I didn't really buy the chemistry between the two. This is a fast paced, entertaining and long lasting crime thriller, it's one of Scott's best movies with great performances, very good character dynamics and arcs. It's definitely similar to other movies of this genre but it doesn't hold this movie back from its greatness. 91%/A",9,1,3,23 November 2016
The Green Mile," Frank Darabont and Steven King Go To Prison (Part II)
","Frank Darabont has proved himself to be the master of the prison movie he did this with The Shawshank Redemption and he does it here as well with The Green Mile a movie that I absolutely loved. This film is not only very emotional but it's also incredibly intriguing and a large part of that is due to Michael Clarke Duncan's incredible, Oscar Worthy performance here as Jon Coffey. Duncan proved himself to be a great actor but I had never seen anything like this form him, he brings a vulnerability to his character that always has you intrigued when you don't know the whole story yet but I thought Duncan was perfect at portraying the right amount of innocence and his execution scene will really break your heart and I will reiterate that I truly believe he deserved an Oscar for his performance. Tom Hanks was also fantastic in this film, of course since it Tom Hanks he's incredibly likable but through Hanks performance you know that this character is the best at what he does and his scene Duncan really gave him a time to shine. The mystery around Duncan's character is incredibly interesting, you have your suspicions from his first scene but you don't get all the information all at once your given subtle hints slowly and it makes the film all the more interesting to watch. This film also has a fantastic way of humanising its characters, you get the impression that despite what all these men have done they are still human beings who regret their pasts. This film also made me care about a mouse just as much as any of the human characters an that is truly worthy of praise. I loved how this film depicted The Green Mile itself and was all the guards had fantastic chemistry with one and other. The character of Percy is brought in to be a character that you despise and they do succeed at that and I loved how his character came to suffer but I found the resolution of his arc to be very rushed and their isn't really any kind of fallout from it. Now this film is about three hours long and I didn't really feel it until about the last twenty minutes where scenes begin to drag and don't have the same intrigue that the rest of the film had. I absolutely loved The Green Mile it handles all its characters perfectly, has a fantastic setting, a truly heartwarming message, an extremely interesting mystery and a runtime that goes by very quickly until the last twenty minutes. If your a crier at films then this film will surely get to you. 92%/A",9,0,1,1 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A Suitably Darker Entry That Creates For Satisfying Conclusion To The Prequel Trilogy
","Even though most Star Wars fans will admit the Prequel Trilogy as a whole was a big disappointment, many will argue that it's last instalment, Revenge of The Sith was the best of them and I believe this to be a fantastic movie despite some flaws still remaining over from the past two films. For one the opening of this movie was fantastic, it immediately set the stage for how the universe is since Attack of The Clones and was what ultimately largely what most of the previous two films failed to be, entertaining. The Back and forth between Obi Wan and Anakin was fantastic, they now feel like life long friends and true brothers. For the most part the special effects have improved in this film to the point of looking life like in certain places. The lightsaber duel between Obi Wan, Anakin and Count Dooku was done just right, not only was it extremely well choreographed but it had a more personal touch it that the past duels in the trilogy failed to acquire and made it more satisfying. Now after this opening the film slows down quite a bit and in the last films the painfully slow pace was working against it the film but here it actually works, it helps the narrative flow more freely particularly when it comes to the manipulation of Anakin by the chancellor as it gives the audience a better chance to see the subtle moves he takes in order to mould Anakins mind. But easily the greatest scene of not only this arc but the entire trilogy was the story of Darth Plagueis, the score and performances came together perfectly to create for a scene that gives us insight into the Chancellors mind which gives him more backstory. While it wasn't quite fleshed out enough the eventual confrontation between Obi Wan and General Grievous was very well done, Grievous was a threatening villain and their fight was amazing. The entire sequence of Order 66 is one of the most chilling and effective moments in this entire franchise to see how all the Jedi were assassinated was truly devastating. The final Lightsaber duels are incredible, the choreography is stunning and you can tell the anger that goes into each strike and the pain that they both feel. The last scene of this film is very good the score is stunning and I liked how it mirrored that of the one in a new hope. This is far from a perfect movie however. For one when it comes to Green Screens the special effects are not at all convincing, they look completely fake and maker you realise that they are being filmed in a set. I also think that the love story of this film is not a good motivator for Anakin to turn into Darth Vader and made his Origin less effective than the original trilogy would imply. While it is stunning to look at the final fight between Obi Wan and Anakin goes in for far to long to ridiculous degrees. I thought Revenge of The Sith was fantastic, it's not flawless but it gave us a very good end to a somewhat underwhelming trilogy, the computer generated special effects were fantastic, the film is visually stunning, the slow pace of the past two films worked for this film and I found this to be very good at not only wrapping up its own trilogy but setting up the original one. 86%/A-",8,1,1,23 December 2016
Inception," The Film of A Generation and One For The Ages
","For my 100th review on IMDb I knew I had to make is special, there have always been a few films that I said I would never review on the site and Inception is one of them mainly because it's my favourite movie of all time so it's hard for me to truly get across just how much this film has inspired me. I am however going to give it a try, for one Christopher Nolan gives some of the best direction ever given to a film because it's dine in such an ambitious way, he's always trying something new to really sell us to this world of the dream that all look absolutely stunning, they feel genuine as they would come across as in this situation, I don't care if I'm kicking a dead horse but Nolan deserved an academy award for his masterful directing of this film. This film completely respects the intelligence of its audience, Nolan doesn't try to sugarcoat any of the tough to understand dialogue but gives full complicated speeches on this complex process, I can tell you that I had a very hard time understanding this film when I first saw it but that didn't make me feel less intelligent it measly made me want to go back and watch it again and again. The performances in this film are all perfect, none of the actors or actresses try to overact but give subtle performances that feel real and less movie like. Leonardo DiCaprio is so fantastic in this movie he's so perfect at selling his characters pain, his character is also impeccably written, he's given a clear reason for why he is trying to perform this last job and it gives the audience a better reason to get behind him as a person. I loved Ellen Page in this film she had amazing chemistry with DiCaprio and was out conduit into this world. Tom Hardy could not have been better cast in this film he was hilarious and stopped this film from having all similar characters. The way this film is structured is done to perfection, its built like a heist film so in the first half we get an ingenious look into this technology and its workings and in the second half we get a mind blowing sequence that has incredible action scenes, impeccable set design and we get a true conclusion to DiCaprios character. Everything in this second half is built up perfectly and has your heart beating and your 100% invested in the characters. This is mainly due to the script that ensures that this isn't just an action film with a good premise and some cool explosions but instead a thought provoking piece of film making. The ending of Inception is one of the most effective ever put to film, it gives e dry viewer a different perspective and allows them to always explore it in a different way with every repeat viewing. Inception is beyond masterful, it's a thought provoking, incredibly entertaining, emotional investing piece of cinematic brilliance, I can not begin to tell you just how much Inception has gone on too inspire me to explore film it self. This will forever be my favourite film and will always hold a special place in my heart. 100%/A+",10,2,4,14 January 2017
Arrival," Not A Masterpiece, An Achievement
","Arrival was one of my most anticipated movies of 2016 I loved all the trailers for this film and the talent behind it made me even more excited to see the final product and I can safely say that I was blown away by the final product. This is a slow burning, thought provoking and incredibly intriguing Sci Fi masterpiece that I think in future years will become a classic. Amy Adams gives one of the greatest performances of her entire career in this film, she perfect embodies someone who is determined in her pursuit but damaged by her experiences and it's a performance that will hopefully give her an Oscar. Jeremy Renner was just perfect casting for this film he was incredibly convincing in this film and his chemistry with Adams was fantastic. Forrest Whitaker was great in this film and it was nice to see a different type of role from him. The slow pacing of this film worked perfectly it helped to build up the slow burning suspense and gave the characters more time to be developed better. The special effects in this film are also fantastic mainly because they are used sparingly as it is clear that the focus is more on the characters. Denis Villeneuve did such an amazing job directing this film he really sucked you into the situation and made it seem more life like. This film asks a lot of questions about humanity and how it interacts and these questions are incredibly intriguing and thought provoking it forces the audience to think on real life and accurate the events of this film are to real life. The whole mystery of why the aliens are here is done perfectly you're more that likely to change your mind at least once and when a mystery like that is built up for so long it's hard to make the eventual discovery satisfying but in this case it was, the eventual reveal makes you look at this film in an entirely different way, the film also doesn't feel the need to answer every question it asks leaving certain things ambiguous that allows the viewer to think on their own answers. Arrival is a film that trusts the intelligence and patience of its audience, it is complex and thought provoking but is never boring or dull.

","Birdman is unlike any movie I've ever seen before and that's the highest praise I could give a movie and is one of the reasons I love it so much. One thing I loved about this film was the way it was directed, I've always loved watching long, on stake shots but expanding it out across an entire movie is something that never crossed my mind and I loved it, it just gave this film a flow that allowed it to be perfectly paced and is possibly one of the best directed movies I've ever seen. The way this film views the modern film industry is fantastic, it's not done in an insulting way but in a way that allows the viewer to think upon other big blockbusters. Michael Keaton is amazing in this movie, I've always liked him as an actor but he's never really blown me away until this film, he was able to draw from his own life experience to add to his performance and is overall just a unique performance. You really felt for his character you understood why it was so important for this play to work out for him. Edward Norton is one of my favourite actors and this is easily one of his best performances, not only does he succeed at being a scumbag but he's also able to bring a humanity to his character that makes him more compelling, like Keaton you understand completely why he is the way he is. Emma Stone has really grown on me in recent year but I've never seen her like this, it's a completely disgusting character but it's not needless, you understand her past experiences and why she is the way she is, Stones now famous monologue in this film blew me away, my jaw was on the floor and eyes were glued to the screen. This movie is very interpretative and I liked that about this film. You don't completely understand what is going on and the choice of leaving an open ending really made me want to go back and watch it again to try and form your own theories and understand better. This film also does great things with its characters, the reason all the performances Birdman are so good is because there all developed perfectly, they all have great backstories and reasons for their attitudes. To be honest I don't really have any flaws with this movie, I can't explain it but I just can give this film a 10. But it doesn't change the fact that I love this film. I admired how it tried to be different, I loved all the character and performances. It perfectly and paced and directed and I believe that this is one of those films that everybody, film fan or not, should experience at least once in their lifetime. 91%/A",9,1,2,19 November 2016
The Big Short," A Solid Drama From A Comedic Director
",I was so excited to see this movie I thought it had the potential to be this years The Wolf of Wall Street but I was slightly disappointed as this film wasn't quite as good as I wanted it to be but was a good film but unfortunately not great. Yet this film still has plenty good in it with Christian Bale and Steve Carell being the standouts. I have never seen Christian Bale Iike I have in this movie he's so sympathetic and his character has a great heart to him and he was also very funny in a few scenes that I was not expecting. If you told me a few years ago that Steve Carell was capable of delivering such a good emotional performance I would have been sceptical not only is he great in his fearful and emotional scenes but he's got such a good motivation behind him I thought he was a great character to get behind and Carell is continuing to impress me. Ryan Gosling was also really good in this film he was definitely the most entertaining character he had some great one liners and delivered some of the films biggest laughs. The way the movie dumbed things down for the audience was really smart and unique it's not insulting to the audiences intelligence it's just the filmmakers being self aware. The actual real estate crash itself is very well built up and thought it was such a hard sequence to watch you get just how big the scale of this event was and cannot imagine a better way they could have handled it. Adam McKays direction in this film was a bit on and off for me sometimes he was on point with his unique approach to certain scenes especially in the dumbing down scenes but sometimes he uses intentionally crappy camera work and editing at first I thought that I could get over it but I couldn't and repeatedly got on my nerves. The sub-plot between Brad Pitts character and the two young investors just really did not need to be in this movie it didn't really provide anything extra to this film and detracted from the central story line. The story arcs of some of the supporting characters did not get a satisfying conclusion we never see anything if any wrap up with them other than I kind of dialogue towards the end of the film. There are things I love about this movie and it's undeniably ambitious it's by no means a bad film is got far to much good in it from a performance and writing level to be bad it's not quite as good as I wanted it to be but is still a good movie. 72%/B,7,0,0,10 November 2016
Platoon," In One Word: Real
","Oliver Stone for me is a really interesting director, he stands by his opinions no matter how divisive but this film is far from divisive it paints a picture of real men struggling to survive in a situation they have no idea how to and Platoon is a masterpiece. Easily in my top 50 of all time I adored this movie. From the opening scene of this movie we can tell that the main character played by Charlie Sheen is not even trying to hide his regret or fear he is in constant fear for his life and this was a very bold choice and a very good one, it's clear that Stone took from his own experiences in Vietnam to make this film seem more real and it payed of. This is an extremely atmospheric movie, you can practically smell Vietnam through the screen, every time it rains you feel the soldiers cold and discomfort and has action sequences rivalling that of Saving Private Ryan. Charlie Sheen was excellent in this movie he does a really good job at portraying his character as a vulnerable and inexperienced soldier and it allowed the audience to relate to him more as a character and his one man war between his two sergeants is riveting to watch and gives us an impression as to how the war effected everybody in different ways, take Willem Dafoes character an upbeat sergeant trying to make the best out of this situation or Tom Berengers character a wounded, damaged soul having lost all hope of every regaining the humanity he lost. Both Dafoe and Berenger are amazing in this move and both worthy of Oscars and career highlights for the both of them. This film has some truly disturbing and brutal sequences committed by both sides of this war, it could have been easy for Stone to paint the Americans as the good guys in this conflict but he doesn't there's a lot of scenes where they are truly committing atrocities that will leave an impression on you. Few times have a combination of Screenplay, acting and directing come together so perfectly, I love this movie it's one of the greatest and most realistic war films every made, platoon is one of my favourite movie and one of my favourite best picture winners.

Prometheus," A Worthy and Strange Addition To The Alien Franchise
","When I heard about the massive controversy surrounding this movie I had heard that the biggest reason so many people didn't like it was that it wasn't what fans of the Classic Alien movies were expecting, so I decided to watch this films before any other in the franchise and I thought this film was very thought provoking, strange and fantastic. The thing I loved about this film was how well balanced it was, we had our scares and intense action sequences that were used to but we also have an overarching mystery that makes this film all the more intriguing as the idea of tracking down the beings who originated human life was a very unique ideas. Like the original Alien this film knows exactly how to build suspense, it takes its time to build up the scares through clever editing and Ridley Scott's perfect directing. The special effects in this film were mind blowingly good, there was not a single moment where I wasn't convinced of them, they blended perfectly with the environment. The actual ship, Prometheus it self was very well designed, you could see cues from the original Alien ship in the design but they updated it to appeal to a modern audience while giving a good explanation as to why it looks more advanced. The performances in this film are for the most part really good, Michael Fassbender easily gives the best performance in the whole film, he hot just the right note of intrigue and he was convincing as an android without ever coming across as lifeless. Noomi Rapace was really good in this film, she was a very effective and confident character just like Ripley and was the perfect protagonist for this film. Idris Elba is really good in this film, he is clearly enjoying himself with this role and gave a very enthralling performance. But this film does have some issues that mostly come from the script. For one this film asks a lot of intriguing questions that force the audience to think but never really resolves any of its mysteries and leaves far to much open, I know they were trying to go for a franchise with this film but they still left to much open. But the worst thing about this film is the characters, not only are most of them very forgettable but they're also really dumb, they do things unbecoming of the characters there playing and set up a poor start to the chain of events of this film. I really do like Prometheus, it has fantastic visuals, an intriguing story and Ridley Scott shows that he truly is a master at directing Science Fiction, if Definitely does have some issues with its script but should they take them onboard they can improve upon them for Alien Covenant. 83%/A-",8,1,4,9 December 2016
Wonder Woman," Wonderful
","While I am a big advocate for Man of Steel and how misunderstood I found that movie to be by many I cannot deny that since then the DCEU has had many issues with Batman Vs Superman and Suicide Squad being deeply flawed movies. While this did dent my confidence in Wonder Woman a but I was still convinced it would be a big improvement and hopefully set this universe back on the right track and thankfully my faith was very well placed. Wonder Woman is without a doubt one of my favourite movies of this year so far and a lot of that has to do with the titular character herself. Gal Gadot is brilliant as her, she brings just the right amount of naivety yet sheer will to this character, she's brilliant in the action sequences and like Ben Affleck before her has proved plenty of her doubters wrong. All the performances in this movie we're solid Chris Pine was great, even though I was a bit disappointed that he didn't enter this universe as Green Lantern he made this character his own and really stood out. David Thewlis brought quite a lot to his character and I liked the good nature of his character. Wonder Woman had a nice heart to it which I really appreciated. The tone was just right, it was good for this film to go down a more light-hearted direction, I didn't mind the dark tones of MOS and BVS but I don't want non stop darkness, there is room for some lightheartedness that this film had just the right amount of. It did have its more serious and darker moments it felt like there was a good balance between the light and dark that Suicide Squad couldn't quite find. I've always liked that the DCEU has put there characters first, even if they don't always succeed and this film was no acceptation. Diana and her arc in this film was just right, I liked her primary mission but also a lot of the obstacles she experiences along the way that show her humanity is not a perfect as she would like it to be. I loved Chris Pine's character in this movie, not only was he really funny as well as very entertaining, he had great chemistry with Gal Gadot that made you care even more about his character even if they did take him in some predictable routes. I also really enjoyed the team of men who accompany them, they weren't in the film much but shined when they were and added some much needed levity.I loved the World War One setting of this movie, it let this movie stand on its own truly apart for the rest of the universe. They didn't really shy away from some of the horrors of this war and tied it in nicely with its main plot. It also gave director Patty Jenkins a chance to really shine, she directed this film fantastically, she took to the action sequences very well making them seem somewhat real as well as gritty. My biggest issue with this movie was it's villainous characters, I liked there designs and were good in the action set pieces but they felt quite conventional and under-utilised. Often there'd just be scenes cutting back to them talking ominously about there lack of time or there evil plans, it felt a bit jarring compared to the rest of the film and most of there plot line doesn't truly come to ahead until the final act. Wonder Woman is a step back in the right direction for the DCEU, it had terrific action sequences with solid characters played very by the actors and actresses portraying them, it had a good heart to it that benefited the lighter tone while not being without its darker moments. It did have issues with its villains but that's a small price to pay for a truly fantastic experience that feels like a good half way between the DCEU's haters and its supporters. 9.1/10-A (Phenomenal)",9,18,38,6 August 2017
Raging Bull," A Scorsese Film About A Lot More Than Just Boxing
","I'm no boxing fan so I can't honestly say that I was dying to see this movie until I learned that Scorsese himself is not a boxing fan but he wanted to tell this story so this intrigued me even more and after always hearing about the massive praise for Robert De Niro performance I have to say I was very impressed. I'm gonna start out by saying the cliché thing when talking about this movie, Robert De Niro is absolutely incredible in this film it's in my opinion the greatest performance he's ever given, through De Niros performance when see La Motta gradually becoming his title of being a 'Raging Bull' and was a truly terrifying presence. The boxing scenes in this film are so real, Scorsese did such a good job directed this film he put you right in their to the point where you could feel the power of every punch and move made. Joe Pesci was so fantastic in this film he seemed like a real scumbag but was never over the top at his chemistry with De Niro was completely on point. La Mottas character arc was handled perfectly, you understood just how much of his humanity he was losing both physically and mentally to the point where you actually start to pity him while still fearing him at certain points. Now one of the most common things to find in a Scorsese film is a female love interest that comes to hate the protagonist and this film has this but works for this film as it added to character arc of La Motta and gave room for Cathy Moriarty to give such a great and damaged performance in this film. However if I am completely honest I don't quite like this film as much as everyone else does, I do have one of two minor issues with this film for one, I didn't think making this film Black and White really added anything to this film and at times was just distracting and I think that the portion of the film that focuses LaMottas success in the ring is to short, the film montages over his major successes and does subtract some What from the intensity of the final fight. However I do think that the last act of this film was very effective as it got away from the boxing and focused on the characters aftermath of his time in the ring and we go from despising LaMotta to as I said sympathising with him and I truly thought that De Niro pulled it of perfectly. Raging Bull is a fantastic film, I don't quite think it's a masterpiece but it's got an incredible Robert De Niro performance, really intense and personal boxing matches and a perfect way of giving insight into its title character and giving him a complexity that makes him a better character. 86%/A-",8,3,4,4 December 2016
The Silence of the Lambs," A Chilling Masterpiece
","The Silence of The Lambs is one of my all time favourite movies which surprises me because I am very much not a horror movie fan but I adore this movie it just does everything right not just in terms of a thriller but as a movie as well. Probably the most iconic thing about this movie is the characters and every character has something interesting about them whether it be an unhinged serial killer that has nothing else to lose or a young FBI agent trying to find her way in the world and the latter is what makes Clarice Starling such an excellent protagonist she gives the audience something to relate to in this film and Jodie Foster is absolutely amazing in this film she perfectly captures her characters wit, innocence and fear and is never anything less than convincing. But in the end it was Anthony Hopkins incredible turn as iconic serial killer Hannibal Lector that truly stole this movie. The film takes its time to build up Lecter as an antagonist so that when he isn't on screen were dying for him to return and makes Hopkins performance all the more terrifying. Make no mistake this movie is not for the faint of heart it has a lot of blood, guts and gore but all the violence serves a purpose it allows us to get sucked into this world and know just how much theses characters mean business. While Hannibal Lector is An Antagonist in this film he isn't the main one the main focus of this film is the Hunt for deranged serial killer Buffalo Bill. Not only is the mystery and hunt for him just incredibly interesting to watch but it makes the film an entertaining one its not just a compilation of death scenes it's what gives this movie it's rewatch value along with the scenes where Starling and Lector just talk. We learn so much about these two people in these scenes not just thought exposition but by the way they act towards one and other revealing both of their insecurities. I Can't think of a single person who doesn't at least like this movie it's just so lovable with amazing performances and an excellent main mystery. A+-100%",10,2,3,14 October 2016
X-Men: First Class," Beyond EXpectations
","X Men is one of my favourite franchises of all time I've liked most of them but I wasn't entirely sure if this film was going to be my cup of tea but I could not have been more far off and could not have loved it more. The whole plot of this film revolves around the friendship between Xavier and Eric, even though we knew that they were eventually going to fall out the filmmakers could not have done a better job at portraying their friendship. They are very well set up as very different characters and feel as if they can both achieve what they want through each other. The chemistry between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender was amazing and it helped to make the film much more investing. Jennifer Lawrence was also fantastic in this movie as Mystique she real carried her characters conflicted nature throughout. The villains in this film were also fantastic, ill admit their motivations were a bit conventional but it terms of pure threat level and back story they were done just right and set up as the perfect opposing force to the mutants. Another thing that I loved about this movie is that all the characters contribute something to the plot whether it be through there abilities or opinions it proves that the X Men franchise is much more than just pure superhero entertainment but thought provoking drama that in some ways mirrors real life. We got to see things in this film that we have never seen in any of the other films in this series, for one we see younger more relatable versions of Professor X and Magneto, we see Charles as a young bachelor and his humble beginnings, we see a vulnerable and in some ways reckless Magneto and it not only adds something to this film but to the franchise itself. Another thing we saw in this film that we've never seen in any other X Men films is he actual recruitment and training of the mutants, we get to see just how Xavier did it and lived up to all expectations. When we eventually see the fall out of Magneto and Professor X it's heartbreaking, we see just how similar yet different both of them are and it really helps to give context to the rest of the franchise. This film was not only a gift to all fans of X Men but a very entertaining, thought provoking drama that builds up and gives context to a lot of events that we've heard about in the other films. All the casting was perfect, McAvoy and Fassbender have absolutely amazing chemistry and is easily one of this franchises best instalments. 100%/A+",10,1,1,13 January 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," A Master Class Film Almost Equal To Its Predecessor
","On the lead up to this film it was clear that this film was not going to be better than its predecessor but in my opinion this is a flawless movie that falls only ever so short of The Dark Knights perfection. This movie was different from what people were expecting that's why I think so many people came out against this movie it's not always 'entertaining' but that's not a bad thing it's an incredibly deep character study of a broken man trying his best to regain what he lost. In The Dark Knight Christian Bale didn't get as much time to shine because of Heath Ledgers incredible performance as The Joker but this is his movie nobody steals this one from Bale he's perfect at betraying a broken and even afraid Batman and truly gave his Batman the send of it deserved. Tom Hardy was perfect casting for Bane he's not only very physically imposing but his mind games makes him all the more interesting and to date remains Hardy's best performance. Michael Caine has constantly shown that he's perfect for the role of Alfred and you see his fear and affection for Bruce in this movie and he truly gives a very emotionally resonant performance. Take choice of allowing Bane to win in his first fight against Batman was a very good choice because we see with out own eyes his power instead of just hearing about it and sets up in my opinion one of the greatest scenes in movie history: Bruce's escape from The Pit. The intensity of this scene was through the roof its was perfectly set up with all of his previous failures to escape and the cuts to the desperate situation in Gotham makes you feel Wayne's desperation to get out and the score, direction and performances all came together perfectly which had me cheering when I saw it in the theatre. The last act of this movie felt more like a war film than anything else the entire build up and battle just feels earned and really makes you realise that it's all coming to ahead. When Batman finally defeats Bane its just such a satisfying end to his character arc you realise that he's a human being behind that mask with a dark past of his own. The final scenes with Bruce just feels like the perfect conclusion to his arc in the trilogy in feels like Batman sacrificed himself for Gotham and Bruce Wayne finds the happiness and peace that he's always wanted. Once you realise that Joseph Gordon-Levitts character is some form of Robin in makes you realise that plenty more will happen after the credits start rolling and I could not have asked for a more satisfying conclusion. The Dark Knight Rises masterfully concludes one of the greatest trilogies we've ever had it just does everything I'd ever want it to and so much more. 100%/A+",10,1,2,27 October 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Deeply Flawed But Undervalued
","Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice was one of my most anticipated movies of all time, the entire three years from when it was announced to its eventual release I had nothing but faith that this film would be excellent. When ever a controversial casting choice was made I was sure that it was the film makers trying to go for something different and while I definitely like this film more than most I was incredibly disappointed. There is still plenty of good in this film though for one Ben Affleck gave an amazing performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman he perfectly sold the characters damaged will and brutality, there was never a moment when he was in screen that I was bored, Afflecks performance is the one thing in this movie that proved everyone wrong and based on this film Affleck could be on his way to becoming the best iteration of the character. Henry Cavill was really good as Superman but the character does have a tendency to A bland and boring at times. Gal Gadot was excellent as Wonder Woman and left a real impression in her limited screen time. Jeremy Irons was brilliant as Alfred he was extremely funny and had excellent chemistry with Bruce. Amy Adams continues to be a bright of these films as Lois Lane. The action sequences in this film are all amazing there brutal and the special effects are pretty much seamless. Ultimately I have to praise this films ambition to tell a complex story of how the world reacts to heroes and all the different perspectives of it. But ultimately that I where this film has its greatest shortcomings, this film simply tries to do to much in to short a time and collapses in on itself. It makes questionable character choices with no real reasoning or motivations particularly Batmans need to kill which in the surface would be an amazing addition to the character but is given no reason behind it so falls flat. I really like Jesse Eisenberg but he easily gives the worst performance of his career in this film but that's ultimately due to the script which turns him into a laughable and cringeworthy character that dragged this film down every time he is on screen. A primary role this film had to fill was setting up this world and the way it was done did the job but was extremely on the nose and felt shoehorned into the plot. I have heard from a lot of hardcore fans of this film that in the future this will become a cult classic while I'm not sure I can bring myself to agree with that nothing would make me happier. It's got an incredible lead Performance from Ben Affleck, it has its entertaining sections and I loved this films ambition but it all ended up collapsing in on itself and created more a very messy and muddled film that could have been so much better. 63%/C+",6,1,4,6 January 2017
Blade Runner," One of The Definitive Sci-Fi Masterpieces
","Ridley Scott has made a name for himself by mastering several different genres but he's always been at his most comfortable in Sci-Fi and Blade Runner is proof to this. Blade Runner is a masterpiece, it's completely flawless, there is not a single other film like this one despite many trying. The plot of the movie seems simple but in the end it's really a story about life itself and how you use yours not matter how long or short it may be. Harrison Ford was the perfect casting for the character of Rick Deckard he's fantastic in this movie he's perfect and being an experienced operative while also managing to come across as exposed when he meets Sean Youngs character and his arc gives the film a more personal touch. The design of the city of Los Angeles 2019 is absolutely incredible the special effects are seamless and it legitimately feels like it could happen one day. It's not a perfect future it's one full of crime and poverty but that's a good thing because it makes the film feel more real and less like a fantasy Utopia. Rutger Hauer was fabulous in this movie he's just the right amount of menacing without ever seeming over the top and his monologue towards the end of the film is just a marvel to watch and few times have my eyes been more glued to the screen that during this monologue. There aren't a whole lot of action sequences in this movie but when there are it's not only riveting but really intense Ridley Scott clearly carried over the techniques he used in Alien to maintain tension and it fits just right into this film. Like I said there aren't a whole lot of action sequences in this movie it's mostly dialogue and got some of the finest and most intriguing ever put to film every new scene forces you to think and reevaluated were you were in the last scene and demands and grips your attention. Ridley Scott is truly one of the finest directors ever he knows how to direct a movie he holds back and shows just enough to keep the viewers attention. A lot of the moments in this movie don't make a whole lot of sense but it's meant to be that way, we're meant to be wondering what the hell we just watched and force us to got back and watch it again. I completely understand why this film was hated upon release it was something completely different from everything else and still is to this day A+/100%",10,0,3,7 November 2016
Casino Royale," Bond Deconstructed
","James Bond is a classic franchise to me, I grew up with it and have loved it for as long as I can remember. Casino Royale isn't the bond film I necessarily grew up with but given how different and darker it was from any other film that came before I think it was better that I waited till I was older to watch it. Casino Royale is one of my most respected Bond films and to date remains my 2nd favourite in the franchise (right behind Skyfall)The first thing to talk with about this film is Bond himself, Played masterfully by Daniel Craig in an amazing performance. Seeing him in a vulnerable state and a less experienced character made him a lot more investing as character and made it seem less cinematic and more of a grounded portrayal. Daniel Craig was the perfect choice for this new iteration, his performance was some of the finest acting in the 50 year franchise in a variety of scenes that require him to play the character at his best and worst. He's be bond for as long as I can remember and it'll be sad to seem him leave the role.The tone was also something I loved about this film. The lighthearted as more carefree bond isn't really a character who I want to see in a modern setting and I think this more grounded portrayal was exactly what the character needed. Martin Campbell's direction played a large part in this, he creates the films perfect tone with his restrained touch that allows the actors performances to breathe and allow the action sequences to be clear and easy to behold. Like many other things in this film, the directing is some of the series best.The films also sports an excellent supporting cast. Vesper was an excellent love interest and one of played of bond perfectly. It was very easy to believe the bond that the two characters come to share all thanks to the excellent writing and perfect chemistry between Craig and Green. Mads Mikkelsen is one if today's best actor and one who is born to play a villainous role. He manages to exude confidence and a real threat level with very little dialogue, managing to convey it all through his eyes and slight movements. Despite it being a reboot I'm so glad Judi Dench remained on as M, she's the definitive version of the character and plays of Craig in a way no other character can.Casino Royale is a love letter to bond while managing to be a completely different experience than any other entry in the series. The complete reinvention of the character was exactly what the series needed and made Craig an instant fit for the role. It made Bond more of a cohesive franchise with more of a character at its centre. It's one of my favourite action films and one of bonds best films.10/10 - A+ (Incredible)",10,0,3,30 December 2018
The Deer Hunter," Not A War Film But A Character Piece
","At first glance Michael Ciminos, 'The Deer Hunter' would appear to be a war film but it's not really like this it's really about a friendship that is torn apart by the Vietnam War and this makes this film a much more compelling film to view and a damn good one at that. I loved The Deer Hunter mainly because of its characters and how the film takes the time to build them up. This film uses its extremely long run time to its advantage, so that it can fully take the time to explore its characters and how their experiences effect them. The friendship in this movie is a believable one, they feel genuine because that do things that real friends do, they argue and make fun of each other but ultimately respect one and other and that makes the characters seem more relatable in the eyes of the audience. Robert DeNiro is fantastic in this film, De Niro pulls of his character with style he makes him a wounded soul but one that is still loyal I could not have seen anyone else play this character. This is easily Christopher Walkens best performance because he gives such a genuine performance in all aspects of his character when it comes to his likable and childish character but also his traumatised persona that is made very believable through the films fantastic writing. Meryl Streep was really good in this film I do have a few issues with her character that I will elaborate on. Now this film doesn't have many action sequences but when they come they are extremely brutal and realistic because of the time Cimino took to build the stakes of them and the Russian roulette sequences are incredibly intense and extremely well directed. This film has an excellent way of analysing the effects of war of its characters you get the idea that they don't want to be viewed as heroes and I loved the last act of the movie that explores this idea. I suppose my biggest issue with this film is the eventual romance that blooms between De Niro and Streets characters and it's mainly because I didn't feel any kind of chemistry between them and unlike other aspects of this film such as the central friendship and the war sequences it just didn't feel genuine and was extremely forced. The Deer Hunter is an amazing film, it's a film that any film fan looking for substance and well developed characters should watch, its a film that never feels fake and has some truly amazing performances and is easily one of my favourite Best Picture Winners. 92%/A",9,0,1,4 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Masterpiece That Breathed New Life Into This Franchise
","Seeing Star Wars The Force Awakens at midnight one year ago today is the greatest cinema experience I've ever had in my life, the theatres were full to the brim and everyone was dressed up but I was still cautiously optimistic but I was blown away by an incredible movie. I adored this movie, I think it's better than A New Hope and almost on Par with The Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi. This film understands that the most vital part of A Star Wars movie is the characters, we are given the time to care and love these new characters because they're developed perfectly, there character progression felt natural and they fit right in with the rest of the veterans. Kylo aren't was an amazing villain, mainly because he isn't completely a bad guy yet but instead a well rounded and complex character struggling with the overwhelming odds he faces. Of course since this is a Star Wars film the special effects are perfect and fit in just right with the rest of the environment. The performances are all fantastic, Daisy Ridley fit right into this role and was extremely likable, John Boyega was not only hilarious but also had a real complexity to him as a character and let us see things from a stormtroopers perspective. Harrison Ford came right back into Han Solo perfectly, he had amazing chemistry with the other characters and was just great to see him back again with a whole new layer of characterisation added to him. Back I really have to be honest the greatest performance in this film was Adam Driver, he gave an amazing performance that rides just the right Lin between fragile and hostile and he made Kylo Ren a much better character to watch and was in my opinion worthy of an Oscar nomination. This film unlike the prequels understands that this film is part of a trilogy, so we are left hanging on certain things and left to wonder for a while, which in the long run will make the whole trilogy more satisfying. JJ Abrams was the perfect choice to direct this film, he paced this film quickly while occasionally slowing down to develop the characters more, he made sure that this film had the greatest Lightsaber battles in all the franchise. Now I Know that the common complaint with this film is its similarities to A New Hope but in this case it did work for the narrative and reintroducing us into the world, we got amazing new characters with great interaction with the old and makes me desperate to see the rest of this trilogy while wondering if it'll be able to live up to this. 100%/A+",10,15,48,15 December 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Perfect Culmination of A Perfect Trilogy
","Lord of The Rings Return of The King is one of the most universally beloved movies of all time at all the praise it receives could not be more deserved this is an incredible movie that is the definition of how to conclude a trilogy. Lord of The Rings has never been about the battle sequences they are all about the characters and their interactions. Frodo and Sam have some of the best chemistry I've ever seen in a movie they just feel like they are meant to be each other and feel like brothers every time they are on screen. Aragon, Legolas and Gimili are also amazing together not only are they great for producing laughs but they also have a great connection with one and other you see how well they work together and how they have come to trust and love one and other. The constant physiological warfare between Sam and Gollum is made all the more thriller through the opening of this movie which reveals his finding the one ring and in a very disturbing sequence his mental deterioration afterwards. Faramir and his relationship with Theoden is thrilling you always feel for him. The rather odd pairing of Pippin and Gandalf in this movie is also amazing they just feel like each others crutches during their experiences. Though these films have never relied on the battle sequences they've always benefited from them and here they are incredible you feel the stakes because of how well these characters have been developed, you feel the scale of the enemies they are facing and the grittiness of the close quarters combat. This movie contains one of the greatest third acts ever put to film you just know that it's all been building to this and your heart cannot stop beating. The final showdown between Middle-Earth and Saurons army is extremely satisfying especially to see Aragon take his rightful place as king and to see all these different species truly come together as one. Another inspiring sequence is when Sam and Frodo finally arrive at Mount Doom it feels like the perfect culmination of the story arc and seeing these characters succeed despite being all but broken because of it shows us that they're flesh and blood characters with everything to lose. Now I know it's popular to complain about the long ending but it really works it helps to put the events of the entire trilogy into perspective and the final scene with the Hobbits and Gandalf leaves me in tears every single time again because of how feel we have come to know these characters but also let's you know that they have further adventures ahead of them after the credits roll. Return of The King truly is one of the greatest movies ever made there is not one single flaw with it and is the definition of not only how to conclude a trilogy but how to do a movie as a whole.

Munich," A Masterpiece That Has No Heroes
","When speaking of Steven Spielberg Munich is a film that isn't always mentioned as much. But it should be because this is an incredible film by him and is truly one of his best efforts. Personally I have no stake in The Israel-Palestine conflict but for those who do I can assure you that this is a very neutral movie Spielberg doesn't paint either side as heroes every character is a flawed human being who for better or worse is fighting for what they believe in. Munich pulls no punches during the massacre scene is brutal and bloody and disturbing to watch. Eric Bana is in my opinion and extremely underrated actor he blew me away in this movie he perfectly conveys his characters inexperience at first to the end where he is a wounded veteran traumatised by what he's done. That is another great thing about this movie there are consequences to the killings in this film it takes a toll on the characters and forces them to question what they're doing. A pre-bond Daniel Craig plays a supporting role in this film and he's excellent here he's such an interesting character despite the fact that he plays it a bit more simply than the others proving that he can do much more than just play James Bond. Another actor I love is in this movie Ciarán Hinds is in this film and is completely Oscar Worthy I loved his characters conflicted attitude and moral compass and was a very intriguing character thanks to Hinds captivating performance.I loved the teams dynamic in this film you just want them to all come out OK in the end and fear for them every time they put themselves in danger and like I said it's not straightforward they have conflicting opinions on what they're doing and why. The Final Shot in this movie is one of the greatest and most effective uses of symbolism I've ever seen it reflects Aavners arguments perfectly and tells us that Ever action has a reaction.I like Crash unlike most people, I love Brokeback Mountain like most people but I absolutely adore Munich I've watched it far more times that I really should have this is one of my all time favourite movies and should have won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Adapeted Screenplay. Even if you don't agree with the the subject matter you should watch this movie for its powerful themes of trust, doing the right thing and (in a way) justice.A+-100%",10,3,4,1 October 2016
Looper," The Way To Do Original Sci Fi
",It's pretty rare to see a movie this original today but that's what makes it even more exciting once it does come around as looper is a fantastic Sci Fi movie and proved how much potential Rian Johnson has as a director to the point where he's being trusted with Star Wars Episode 8. The plot in this movie was fantastic it's just so smart and original and it made for a realistic world of the future as its not bloated it feels like a real world that could exist one day. Joseph Gorden Levitt is great here he's surprisingly convincing as a young Bruce Willis who also kills it in this movie. This is a time travel movie and there not always easy to get right as there are countless paradoxes and plot holes but not here the situation is very well realised and logical. The movie is for the most part very well paced which is remarkable considering that we have to get an entire history of Bruce Willis' character thought a series of flashbacks. The kid in this movie gives possible the best performance in the hole movie and maybe even the best one ever given by a child actor. My only real issue with the movie is a section where the characters are in a single location for about 25 minutes and it drags a bit during this sequence. Other than that looper is a fantastically original Film. 97%-A,10,0,1,10 June 2016
Casino," Somewhat Derivative But Has Plenty of That Scorsese Magic
","I adore Martin Scorsese he's an amazing director and has ultimately mastered the mob movie with films like Goodfellas which I love, but I often hear people talk about this movie as if it is on par with it but I have to disagree with that I find this movie a bit overrated but far from terrible. I also like to start reviews of positively so I will say that I loved the world that was set up in this film, the whole mobster world hidden behind the guise of casinos in Las Vegas was a very entertaining aspect to this movie. Robert DeNiro is really good in this film I loved the scenes he had with Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone he was very imposing and did a great job in this film. Joe Pesci was good but it definitely felt like we've seen things like this from him before. But by far the best performance in this movie was Sharon Stone she was amazing in this movie she was perfect at conveying a damaged and sick woman with no way out and her break down scenes are just amazing to watch. This movie is extremely violent but I loved that about this movie, the violence was effective it showed the brutality of this system and made it feel all the more realistic. However I think this movie has some very big flaws that people has ignored. For one the first 30-45 minutes of this movie are nothing but exposition through narration your given all the inner workings of this world and everyone in it but it just doesn't work because it's given to you all at once and your struggling to catch up and should have been given slower and more gradually across the movie. Another massive issue that has been addressed with this movie is how many similarities it has to Goodfellas but it never comes close to matching that films greatness. Since its structured and layed out so similarly to Goodfellas the film feels like it has the massive hole in it, since the characters that DeNiro and Pesci are playing in this film are so similar to their characters in that movie you feel as if there should be another character in it to fill the place of a Henry Hill but there isn't and the film never recovers from that. This film is also very long and makes for a lot of moments to drag on and I wasn't really satisfied with how they wrapped up Sharon Stones character arc. Casino is a flawed movie it's got some really good performances, it's very well directed and has a great world to it, but the simple fact is that we've seen movies like this from Scorsese before and it's has far to much narration given out over to long a time. Though it's far from Scorsese best it's still a solid film. B-/71%",7,1,2,18 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A New Hope For Cinema
","Star Wars A New Hope is a film that is really hard to review, how am I going to say anything new? How am I going to give my own spin on this film? Well I don't know but I'm going to give it a try. Considering that this film came out the The 1970s I really cannot praise the Ambition of George Lucas enough, he created an entire world in this movie, a world that has been explored ever since the release of this film and the exposition feels natural and done to make the universe seem lived in. The special effects of this film still hold up to this day Most likely due to Lucas' decision to use practical models over full blown images created entirely through digital means. While this film is undeniably incredibly entertaining one of the greatest praises I can give this film is its complete reliance on its characters. This film has its characters all in interesting places and the screenplay all gives them compelling arcs and interaction and makes this film even more worth watching. While the main characters were done extremely well so too were the villains particularly this film (and the trilogy's) main antagonist, Darth Vader. While in this film exclusively we don't learn so much about him as a person he just has this presence to him every time he is on screen, he's a very imposing villain and this film clearly set the standard for how to build a compelling antagonist. Another thing I loved about this movie was the fact that it didn't feel the need to give all the answers, it left certain things open ended in order to make the sequels more compelling and it was not done in a shameless way to simply profit out of it but for a story telling device that paid off in masterful form. The spaces sequences in this film are jaw dropping, like I said he special effects are seamless but the pure tension and believably of it all makes the final battle of this film much more entertaining and gives us an impression of real stakes. My one and only gripe with this film is certain points where the film slows down needlessly and sometimes just to provide exposition that was purely not required. I can't say anything about this movie that hasn't already been said, this is one of the most popular, most talked about and most iconic movies of all time. From a character and technical level this film is astonishing and is without a doubt a film that will live on forever for every generation to come. 97%/A",9,0,0,23 December 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," As Unique As A Spoof Movie Could Be
","I love Spy movies like James Bond, Jason Bourne and Mission Impossible. But those franchises while still amazing don't always manage to retain some of their more sillier aspects that made them so unique but Kingsman The Secret Service is able to be a modern spy/action film that feels like it could be a 1960s spy flick and was on elf my favourite movie of 2015. The cast is the movie ranges from unknowns to veterans but they all bring something to this movie, Taron Edgarton was the perfect lead for this movie not only is he really funny and entertaining but he had a great arc to him that made you love and sympathise with him and made excellent chemistry with Colin Firth who was also Fanta in this movie I loved seeing him to something different, an action heavy and suave spy and he really stole this movie for me. The action sequences are so good in this movie Matthew Vaughn did a really great job at directing this movie, you feel every punch and bullet in every fight scene and the church massacre is without out a doubt this films greatest action set piece. The villains in this movie were really entertaining and perfectly balanced of the Spy leads. Samuel L Jackson was so great in this movie I loved his lisp it made him seem more vulnerable and is again a reference to 1960s spy flicks. But by far a more on the nose reference was his female assistant Gazelle I loved her. The sword legs were a really nice touch that made her all the more bad ass. The training sequence of this film is a great way to set up this world of the Kingsman, I loved seeing Eggsy over come obstacles and put up with the spoilt rich kids. I really liked the character of Roxy in this film I thought she had really good chemistry with Eggsy and I really hope that they'll explore their relationship more in the upcoming sequel. The overall plan that Samuel L Jacksons character has is completely far fetched but works for this films more comical and silly tone and made for an excellent final battle. Kingsman The Secret Service perfectly blended modern aspects and older throw backs and was great way to kick of a potentially great new action franchise. 94%/A",9,2,3,7 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Definitive Step Up Sequel
","When talking about sequels that improved ten fold over their originals The Empire Strikes Back will always rightfully be mentioned because this is a film that takes its characters to whole new levels of intrigue and development and places them in a vulnerable position and is a masterpiece. For one this films opening is possibly the best of the entire franchise, we are perfectly re introduced to these characters and understand were they all are, we see exactly how they are dealing with the events of the first film and they brilliantly spend this first act building up to the Empires attack in Hoth which gives the battle itself a whole new level of intensity. This first battle is incredible, we feel the scale and power of the empire from all perspectives making you realise just how powerful they really are and how much the Rebel Alliance are up against. When we get past this battle the film is split into two separate arcs that are cut together and told perfectly, there's never a moment we're the audience is bored with either story as the characters along with the storytelling make both of them just as entertaining and satisfying as each other. Luke's time on Dagobah is incredibly intriguing, the way this film talks about the Jedi and The Force is extremely well done it makes them seem more deeper than mere warriors and the inclusion of Jedi Master Yoda was a very good way of emphasising this as it shows the enlightenment The Force can bring. The other arc of this movie cantering around Han Solo and Princess Leia on the run from the empire is extremely entertaining with seamless special effects and a much more intimate and character driven story than the previous instalment, the romance that eventually develops is done just right it feels natural as well as not forced and the chemistry between the two is impeccable. When we finally get to the last act of this film it's all come together perfectly to create for a nail baiting final show down. The fight between Darth Vader and Luke is absolutely incredible, not only the mental but physical war that goes on between the two is so satisfying, the famous reveal doesn't see out of field but plausible and the ending was not entirely satisfactory as it left the characters in a questionable position that sets up for a better place for a sequel. The Empire Strikes Back is not only one of the greatest sequels ever made but one of the greatest movies ever made, the characters are all given their own arcs, it's incredibly entertaining with seamless special effects and action sequences. This sequel builds on everything from the original and improves upon it making for a sci-fi masterpiece. 100%/A+",10,0,0,22 December 2016
Gangs of New York," Scorsese' Underrated Masterpiece
","Martin Scorsese has proved himself to be the master of the mob movie but this was more than just the average mob movie but an inside look into the inner workings of New York City during the American Civil War and the lives of immigrants who lived through it. This was a passion project for Scorsese but when it came out it was written of as flawed and not one of his best and I have to disagree as I believe it's one of his best unlike most and is one of my favourites of all time. The location of New York was incredibly well executed I loved it the world felt lived in and dying with a rich history to it and its some of the best production design I've ever seen in a movie. But the locations are only as good as the characters who live in it and they were all incredibly well realised. Leonardo DiCaprio was perfect casting for this part he was just the right age to pull of that young brute quality that he couldn't pull of now and by its not means his best performance it's still a great one. But Daniel Day-Lewis gave an absolutely incredible performance and one that I believe to be his best he just sinks himself into this despicable and racist character who's able to be entertaining while at the same time terrifying and never leaves the audiences mind. When you hear the word, Gangs in the title you expect a lot of bloody battles but it's not really like that it's more of a dialogue driven political piece that's always interesting to watch. The way the characters go about fighting each other is fascinating to watch I love seeing the unusual methods they use on each other. The tension is slowly built up to a final battle that at first glance doesn't seem very satisfying but you quickly realise that it's meant to be like that your meant to question what the whole point of it all was and leaves a much bigger impact on the viewer that way. The final battle scenes are truly breathtaking you realise the hatred The goes on between all of them but it doesn't feel like pointless rage. Because of how well these characters are written you understand why they feel the way they do even if you know that it's the wrong attitude to have. One of the central plots of this movie is the love story between DiCaprio and Diaz and I personally thought it really worked I thought they boy had excellent chemistry and it really made me want them both to come out safe in the end and even though they do you (like them) do not know what to feel except the tragedies that occur. Gangs of a New York is another testament to Martin Scorsese' greatness he proves himself to be the master of the mob genre but can do much more than just that and I hope that people will come to see this films greatness eventually.

Spectre," Classic Bond (For Better and Worse)
","Spectre was one of my most anticipated sequels of the last few years. With my complete love for Skyfall and the return of Sam Mendes I was convinced this film would replicate my love for that film but in the end Spectre was a mixed bag that did leave me disappointed.On a technical level this film is almost perfect. Sam Mendes return as director did not disappoint, he maintained the level of skill he had in Skyfall. The action sequences are once again brilliant with a good pace and they occur at a more regular pace than its predecessor. The cinematography may not be on the level of Skyfall it's still fantastic in a different way. The opening tracking shot was the right way to start the film on and its a shame the rest of its runtime didn't live up to that.Daniel Craig is again great as 007, he's not given as much of an arc as the last films but he still plays the characters dedication well. Waltz, while underused, has a great presence to him and plays of Craig very well. Fiennes, Whishaw and Harris all return as the MI6 staff and all play bigger roles than ever before and its good to see the filmmakers develop more of a team dynamic than Bond simply acting on his own for the entire runtime.Where the film fails is its pacing and overlong runtime. Spectre is the longest bond film to date and its defiantly felt. There are so many portions of the film that drags and do not justify their need to be kept in the film. The subplot at MI6 don't mesh well with Bonds quest to hunt down Spectre and drags down the pace of the film.
The villains were also fairly disappointing. With the exception of Dave Batista, who played his character perfectly as a physical threat to bond and a fun character to see collide with Craig. Andrew Scott was a fairly one note character one doesn't truly have much screen time to get me invested in MI6 taking him down. Waltz is the perfect cast for a bind villains but he's barely in the movie. The film spends too much time building up to him and not enough time paying off. The decision to merge him and Bonds past didn't work and didn't add enough to either of their characters. I hope Waltz returns in the next film to give him a better script and more screen time to work with.Spectre, while not without its enjoyable moments, was a disappointing movie for me. It's pacing was spotty and dragged on far too long and the villains do not live up to their true potential. It does benefit from its solid supporting cast, great visuals and a fantastic visual design. I do hope that the filmmakers improve upon the faults of this film and improve upon them to ensure that Craig's version of the character can end on a high note.6.4/10 - B- (Middling)",6,0,3,31 December 2018
Braveheart," A Masterpiece That Pulls No Punches
","As a proud Scotsman I can easily say that Mel Gibsons Braveheart is without a doubt one of my all time favourite movies and one of my favourite best picture winners. By far the most common compliant I see about this movie is the fact that it isn't very historically accurate, well the film is not a history lecture you can only judge the movie itself and I support any changes they made to this movie from real events as it makes for an extremely compelling story. The story of Braveheart is simple William Wallace (played perfectly by Mel Gibson) leading a rebellion with his fellow Scotsman against England and its King Edward I. It's a story that's impossible not to get behind because it's all about freedom and from fighting for equality. The violence in this movie is bloody and gory but not in an unnecessary way it serves a purpose of truly showing the way in which the battles, rape and torture scenes took place. Mel Gibson took home the Oscar for Best Director for this film and it's very well deserved he knows just how to film the action scenes just right to put the viewer right into their situation, he succeeds just as well in front of the camera as well because I believe that to this day this remains his best performance he knows exactly how to portray Wallace's internal turmoil, unwanted fame, inspiration attitudes and overconfidence. This movie does not paint Wallace as a perfect man there are scenes where he recklessly puts himself and others in danger to settle his personal vendettas and anger and in that regard this movie is very accurate to real life. The late Patrick McGoohan is excellent here as King Edward he strikes just the right balance between imposing menace and brilliant strategist and is always a pleasure to see him on screen. Peter Hanly is also fantastic as Prince Edward because while he does and excellent job at being a hateful character it's really not as simple as that he's got a character character arc to him that shows him feeling unimportant and struggling to cope with failures and living up to his fathers legacy. The scene of Wallaces execution is one of my all time favourite scenes in a movie it is just such a heartbreaking and inspirational scene that never stops giving me chills. Braveheart could have easily be a simple war film but it's got excellent characters with excellent arcs and motivations and succeeds just as well when it comes to the battle sequences delivering some of the best I've ever seen.

Joy," Far From Perfect but Far From Terrible
","David O Russell in my opinion has truly become one of the best directors working today he's so great at creating character driven pieces that really get you to look into their mind set and get behind and in this regard Joy succeeds. The story if someone trying to sell a mop sounds silly but is actually very investing you get the reasons why Joy wants to do this, to accomplish her dreams and get away from the example that her family has set for her. Jennifer Lawrence once again truly blew me away in this movie and it is Lawrence's movie and she is fantastic in Joy she's likable, funny and easy to get behind. I don't care what anyone says Jennifer Lawrence truly is one of the best actresses working today. Through Lawrence's performance you truly want to see Joy succeed and you hate to see her fail Andy love to see her succeed and truly come to despise all those who get in her way. Robert DeNiro is also very good in this movie he really chews up his manipulative yet hard working character. Edgar Ramírez was also good in this movie you really do feel like he cares and has very good with Lawrence. Like American Hustle, Joy has fantastic production design you really feel like you yourself are in the 1980's I loves the snowy streets and the studio designs. However I do not believe the mixed reviews for this movie come from nowhere. Bradley Cooper is pretty blends, there's just nothing to his character. I do know that ultimately this movie is about Joy Mangano and we learn plenty about her but never anything about anyone's else we don't know why her family are so hard on her and why they want to hold her back. I do legitimately think that this movie is underrated it does have flaws but it's not enough to justify such mixed reviews. I think it's a fine addition to David O Russell's filmography and as always I can't wait to see what he'll do next. 85%-A-",8,6,12,21 October 2016
Slumdog Millionaire," The Right Answer
","Danny Boyle is known as one of the most unique directors working today, whether it be from his films Concepts or the direction he brings to them his directorial efforts can always be described as different and Slumdog Millionaire thrives as part of his filmography and film I truly appreciate, enjoy and think about. Boyle was the absolute perfect director for this project this has to be one of the most strangely directed movies I've ever seen and that is by no means a bad thing, it creates this flow in the film that ensures that the cuts between the different time periods are never jarring. He uses a lot of Dutch angles and bloated colour pallets that help to give this film its very distinctive tone, which is absolutely perfect, it's quite a light hearted film that has a lot of fun aspects and lightheartedness to it but never shies away from the horrors of the characters situations and never glamorises poverty. The character of Jamal Malik is so well written, he such a great well rounded character, which is even more impressive given the fact that his whole arc doesn't play out in a linear structure, when you see his character in present day and in his childhood you absolutely believe how he got to be the way he is in present day, the film portrays him as a sympathetic character because you see so clearly all the hardships he has been through but at the same time is also a very entertaining character, mainly in the flashback storyline. As I said the pacing of this film is perfect, it's fairly fast and very energetic and it keeps this pace for most of the run time and because the film is so well constructed the cuts between the different stories always as a natural flow to them and they play of each other very well. It keep you engaged and intrigued the whole time all from trivia questions.The location is a very prominent character in this movie, it's always used to its full advantage. When your in the slums of India you fully feel the poverty and desperation of the situation and it irritates me on every level when critics claim that this film glorifies situations like this. The game show itself was also used very well, it creates a lot of tension just at the thought of him getting the questions right or wrong but when the narrative unfolds the tension increases as you begin to realise the full reasoning behind Malik being in that situation in the first place. I have but one big issue with this movie and it is the central love story, my biggest issue being that it just came across as very clichÃ©, in a film that has such a unique structure and directorial style it's disappointing to say that, it never really grabbed me and I would have been more than happy for the film to have simply focused around Jamal and his brother entirely. I truly believe that this is a film that anyone can connect too, it's go such a great central character, distinctive style, sense of location and a great heart that will make this movie enjoyable for just about anybody, while I wasn't a big fan of the love story it didn't take me out of this truly fantastic film that I think I can get more out of the more I watch it. 8.7/10: A- (Fantastic)",8,0,0,4 September 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," One More
","Despite all the controversies that Mel Gibson has around him as a person few will argue about his immense talent as a filmmaker. He has proved himself to be one of the most consistent directors working today and Hacksaw Ridge is some of the best work he's done in his entire career The core story of this film is simply fascinating, a man who went into one of the worst engagements of the Second World War without any kind of weapon to defend himself with and this story is one that the viewer can easily get behind because it is so well established why Doss feels the need to do this while not shining him in a truly heroic light. Plenty of time is devoted to his opponents and it's also made clear why they oppose his views as it is understandable why they wouldn't feel they could depend on him to defend them in battle and there is room for the audience to decide where they stand in this argument. One of this films greatest strengths is the fact that it's puts all its characters, as well as the actors who play them, first. Andrew Garfield, in my opinion, gives the best performance of his entire career in this film he just perfectly played Doss' constant inner struggle while always remaining optimistic. Vince Vaughn's role in this film had made me curious in the lead up to this film but it's easy to say that he exceeded all of my expectations, not only was he hilarious as a drill instructor but he gave some very good serious moments that made me like his character all the more and makes me want to see more of this kind of role from him. Teresa Palmer was also great in this movie she had excellent chemistry with Garfield and I absolutely bought her as a love interest. Hugo Weaving blew me away in this movie, I've never seen this kind of work from him, he was so believable as this torn up man who has had some much taken away from him by war.He first half of this film mainly focuses of Doss' romance with his future wife and his motivations for his pacifism and while it's defiantly a bit slow and cheesy at times it worked very well. I loved the romance between Garfield and Palmer it was such a sweet relationship an one I could easily get behind. When we eventually got to the training portion of this film it became all the more engaging, seeing Doss face opposition at every turn was extremely engaging, you got a clear sense to both sides of the argument and perfectly set up the horrors that were to come in the next act. This film switched from an engaging drama to a terrifying experience in an instant and it worked to perfection. Everything the war was built up to be came to ahead and made it clear just how hard it was gong to be for a Doss to keep up his pact but it was no less engaging and was even more so. Mel Gibson directed this film masterfully, he directions action like no other director working today. He doesn't show the battle of Okinawa in a glamorised way but as it was, as a hellish experience with very little hope of survival for the soldiers who thought in it. Even when bullets aren't flying he kept a consistent tension throughout this entire act that never let up. My only real issue with Hacksaw Ridge was some aspects of the way it concluded, it feels as if Doss has proved something to his fellow soldiers and feels as if more could be explored now that he has but instead the film concludes in a very abrupt way that left me feeling as if they're was still more waiting to be explored and experienced. Despite some aspects of its conclusion, Hacksaw Ridge worked on every other level. It was incredibly touching, harrowing and intense. While it was easy to get behind Doss as a character there were plenty moments where it felt as if they're was room to see the perspective of others in his views. When the war sequences begin they are depicted as they should be and in no way way that is glamorous or clean. I adored Hacksaw Ridge and I can't wait to see what Mel Gibson does next as a director. 9.5/10-A (Phenomenal)",9,6,9,5 August 2017
Gladiator," A Movie That Everyone Will Watch At Some Point
","Ridley Scott's Gladiator is and always will be one of my all time favourite movies and I have a problem with anyone who calls this movie overrated. The story in this movie is simple but it works perfectly it allows you to easily get behind Maximus played masterfully by Russell Crowe. Russell Crowe is amazing in this movie he turned a simple character into a compelling and damaged character and he earned his Oscar I could not have seen anyone else playing this character. Joaquín Phoenix was also fantastic here he just is so perfect at making you despise him while also being able to understand his inner turmoil and motives. Thought this movie is much deeper than a bunch of Gladiator matches it is what many casual movie fans will watch this for and their filmed perfectly, Ridley Scott did an amazing job at filming these sequences they feel gritty and realistic. Both the physical and psychological warfare that goes on between Phoenix and Crowe is riveting to watch and always puts you on edge to see what either one of them will do next. You really feel like the crowd in the arena are the true enemy, as if they are the deciders of who will live or die and creates for some very intense sequences. The quieter scenes between Phoenix and Neilson really gives you incite into Commodus' mind you really see a whole other side to him and you see that he's not just a character for the audience to hate but a wounded broken man weighed down by the life thrown upon him. One of the greatest scenes in movie history is the ending to this movie it is just masterful, few times has a character arc come together so perfectly. The final fight between Protagonist and Antagonist is riveting you truly feel as if this is the decider and really showcases both their skills. When Maximus finally lets go and dies instead of feeling sadness you feel happiness that he has achieved what he had to and is now ready to be with his family once more and it is beautiful to watch. Djimon Honsous last scene is also beautiful it gives you one last chance to truly see how their friendship has blossomed. Gladiator is a masterpiece it's, in my opinion, Ridley Scott's best movie every thing about it works and I hate the fact that so many people have turned against this movie and I will never understand why they do.

The Social Network," A Movie That Appeals To Every Generation
","When you first hear that a movie is going to be made about the creation of Facebook you don't think big things from it much less that it would be consider one of this generations masterpieces. Thought I wouldn't go as far as that I still love The Social Network and I think that it's a close second for David Finchers best film. After seeing this film I legitimately could not have seen someone else directing this film he just knows how to direct a movie his process of taking as many as takes as necessary works for this movie as it mirrors the themes of inventiveness and betrayal. This is arguably Jesse Eisenberg most icon role and it is for a reason he's just perfect in this movie his acting style matches perfectly with the character of Mark Zuckerberg who is a fascinating protagonist. Even though he isn't always the most likable character his say-things-as-they-are attitude makes him an intriguing and sometimes funny character that always captures the viewers attention. Most of the events of this film are shown through flashbacks and while that has been seen before it works perfectly for this films narrative and makes for some truly amazing editing. Aaron Sorkins screenplay is one of the best written of recent years it's a script that in some way relates to everyone we've all had something that we're good at in life and want to strive to be the best at, we've all had friends that we want to keep but can't because real life gets in the way all of this is addressed in The Social Networking making sure that everyone will in some way be able to connect with this film. The supporting cast are all fantastic in this film Andrew Garfield was worthy of at least an Oscar nomination in this film he bounces perfectly of Eisenberg and serves a reflection of the audience in this film. Justin Timberlake also really blew me away in this film he just is so good at playing his almost unlikable character and has never since been able to live up to this performance. Overall The Social Network is a guaranteed classic that will forever be remembered by this generation as one of its most relatable movies and one of Finchers best efforts.100%/A+",10,1,1,13 October 2016
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The High Point of The Series
","When I was a kid I was absolutely obsessed with Indiana Jones, it's one of the only franchises where my original impressions when I was young still Rings true to this day, when I first watch all the movies, this was my favourite of the 4 and to this day The Last Crusade is still my favourite entry in the series. One thing I feel this movie does better than any other movie in the franchise is how it characterises Indiana Jones, we actually learn a lot about him in this movie, the opening Flashback was a great way to set up what we've been lead to believe about him and it does this without dialogue but with actions that lets you take it in more. I also adored the inclusion of his father in this movie, Sean Connery and Harrison Ford played of teach other perfectly, it was such a good way to humanise his character and give him some extra vulnerability that he didn't have in the first two films. The set pieces in this film are still absolutely phenomenal, they still hold up to this day. The tank and motorcycle chases still look great, they had real stakes and tension to them because you realise that they were filmed to be practical and realistic and like the past two, Jones isn't a perfect fighter and only just manages to get out of it. But the best set piece in the film is the trials for the holy grail at the climax. It was so good to see Jones use his mind to accomplish his goal rather than with his physical abilities, because of this there was so much tension due to the fact that you didn't know how he was going to get through it. The tone in this movie is perfect, it never feels muddled or conflicted. Large portions of The Last Crusade are hilarious, they integrate comedy into tense moments and it always feels consistent and just makes this film so much more enjoyable. Another thing I love about this movie is that it still has room more those more mature scenes, not necessarily dark but the tone can often shift to being a bit more sombre to suit more character building scenes and it's done so well. The main quest in this movie is my favourite one in large part due to the personal connection they gave it. They set it up as something Sean Connery's character has been searching for over his life and it gets you more invested in where it's going because of that. They use the fact that it will fall into Nazi hands if they don't find it first but it's not as effective a motivator as the emotional connection they gave it to Indy and his father. This has been and will always be one of my favourite movies, it's just Indiana Jones at his best. It's incredibly fun but still heartfelt, it takes lengths to develop the protagonist more and has a quest that the viewer can get more invested in. This (as well as the other 3 entries) is my childhood film that will always be with me. 10/10: A+ (Incredible)",10,1,1,23 September 2017
Sully," A Fantastic Examination of A Forced Hero
","When I first heard about a film being made about the proclaimed 'Miracle on The Hudson' I wasn't really sure how much of a watch it was going to be compelling or even an event capable of making into a feature film but after watching the final product I was extremely impressed and I would consider watching this film again. From the first few scenes I quickly realised that Tom Hanks was a fantastic choice for the role of Chelsey Sullenberger he perfectly embodies his reluctance to accept the title that has been hoist upon him and his characters experience as a pilot. In my opinion Aaron Eckhart gives his greatest performance since The Dark Knight like Hanks he embodies his characters experience and knowledge but unlike Hanks he seems more hot headed and light hearted making him the perfect person to stand next to Hanks. As I previously said I was worried about this film being compelling otherwise it could slip into a tedious bore but thankfully it isn't mainly due to the fantastic structuring of this film, the film doesn't open with the plane crash but instead is gradually cut back to and seen from different perspectives and it was the best way to do this film as it gave weight to the situation and its aftermath, I think if it was done in chronological order it would have made the film slow down and drag after that pivotal moment. Clint Eastwood did such a good job of directing this film but it really shows in the plane crash he makes it intense and lifelike. However my biggest issue with Sully is its lack of subtlety in certain places, places such as the flashbacks to Sully's career in it felt extremely on the nose and came across as forced exposition that was already being perfectly covered with the investigation into the crash. Another area that fell flat was Sullys family drama it just wasn't done well and in the end just came across as a series of phone conversations that didn't really add anything to this film. Sully is a fantastic film, definitely one of Eastwoods better efforts, both central performances from Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart at brilliant, it manages to turn this event into a compelling and riveting experience and I easily one of the best Aviator films I've ever seen. 82%/A-",8,0,0,5 January 2017
Alien: Covenant," Not A True Prometheus Sequel, Not A True Alien Prequel
","I was one of the people who truly enjoyed Prometheus, I found that film to be a good balance between an alien prequel and something that could stand on its own. While it wasn't a perfect film it did leaving interested to see what happened next so I was extremely excited for Alien Covenant and it's fair to say I was pretty let down. There was plenty to enjoy about this movie, Ridley Scott can truly do no wrong when it comes to the direction of a science fiction movie, he directed this movie superbly, he knew how to build tension perfectly, the extremely quick pacing of the action sequences worked and had a lot of gory violence that made the film seem more immersive. Covenant looked fantastic the special effects in the space sequences were all very convincing and the cinematography was excellent. Michael Fassbender and his performance as David and Walter was my favourite thing about this movie, it was completely easy to believe that the two characters he played were two separate entities. The character of David was also a good element in this movie, I loved his mysterious nature, the creep factor he brought to the role this time and some of his more mythological opinions. I also really liked Katherine Waterston in this movie her character got some solid development and I liked how much she resembled Ripley from the original movie. Like Prometheus the ending of this movie did leave me wanting more, I didn't set up a sequel in as a blatant a way as that film did but left on an intriguing note. I do want to see more of this franchise and hopefully the next instalment can be a more successful entry than this one. This was a deeply flawed movie and a lot of that has to do with the characters. I've already praised David, Walter and Daniels but the other new additions were fairly bland, they just felt like expendable plot devices who didn't add a whole lot to this movie. They got next to no development and it became fairly obvious which ones were going to live through this film and those who weren't, because of this there was no real impact to their deaths which only truly served to keep the plot moving. Another big issue I had with this movie was the aliens themselves, in the first film it took the entire run time just to kill one of the creatures but here despite there being a lot more of them there is no real danger to them because there killed off so easily again and again. The effects for them were also very weak, it just looked like cgi and was never really convinced by them. Like I said this film had no idea what it wanted to be, so much of the plot from Prometheus is just dropped and never explored, leaving so many of the big questions that film never answered remain unanswered and made this film even more unsatisfactory. It definitely feels more like an Alien movie than Prometheus but it never truly feels like one thanks to its sub par effects and very underdeveloped characters. Alien Covenant was by no means a terrible film it was just a highly mixed one that didn't really have any threat or stakes to it. Ridley Scott directed this film well, a few intense sequences, and good effects for the scenes set within space. But the titular aliens never felt like a genuine threat with very poor visuals to them and the characters themselves for the most part didn't to much for me. I do want to see what comes next but to get me excited I need the writers to either learn from their mistakes with this film or simply be replaced. 6.6/10: B- (Middling)",5,1,4,7 August 2017
The Martian," Ridleys Redemption
","Despite some recent missteps Ridley Scott will always be one of my all time favourite directors and The Martian just further solidifies this for me because I believe this stands up there with Gladiator and Blade Runner as his best and was my favourite movie of 2015. Matt Damon is incredible in this movie with out a doubt the best performance in a Ridley Scott movie since Russell Crowe in Gladiator and in my opinion should have took home the Oscar for this movie he's amazing with the comedy and the emotion the little moments where his armour starts to crack no you think he wants to give up but he never does, that's what makes Mark Watney such a great protagonist he's easy to get behind and never bores the audience. While nobody steals the spotlight from Damon, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jessica Chastain both hold their own in supporting roles they're more than able to keep the audience invested while we're not on Mars. Speaking of the Red Planet it looks incredible, life like even. You truly care about Mark Witney getting home because you realise how hard he is fighting to survive every time he succeeds you hope it last but quickly realise that it won't and that makes for some truly heartbreaking scenes. The special effects are also amazing in this film their not overused their used sparingly only to advance the plot and put you more into the situation. The arc on earth, while definitely not as interesting as Mars, is still great to watch your behind them 100% to succeed and you truly believe that everyone is important in the rescue mission and that nobody is expendable and with a cast this big that is truly impressive. The Martian is a masterpiece it's got amazing performances, direction and production design it's a perfectly balanced movie that never leaves you bored and leaves me hoping that Ridley Scott will keep that up.

The Fighter," The Perfect Way To Do A Conventional Boxing Movie
","Say what ever you want about David O Russell as a person but you cannot deny how brilliant he is as a director and The Fighter is a fantastic movie from him. As I previously said The Fighter is a conventional boxing movie but when making one of them there are a few things that you need to have for one terrific performances and this film has that with Christian Bale manages to do steal the entire movie with his sympathetic and deluded performance making for an extremely interesting character arc. Mark Wahlberg is also fantastic in this movie giving possibly the best performance of his career as Micky Ward because you can just get behind him not just because Wahlberg is a likable actor but because he convincingly conveys the characters personal struggle. Another thing a conventional boxing movie needs in Good boxing matches and they are expertly filmed making for very intense sequences leaving you on the edge of your seat. Melissa Leo is very good in this movie but you never really understand why she is so horrible towards Micky and Adams character and seeing as it is a big part of the movie that's a lot of unanswered questions. The romance between Wahlberg and Adams characters is excellent and that's a good thing because if it hadn't been it could have brought the movie down but no you buy the confidence that Ward gets from Charlene and the chemistry is top notch. The Fighter doesn't hold back on the raw emotion and heartbreak in this movie and it makes you care even more that the characters get over these heartbreaks. The worst thing about The Fighter is its conventional aspects but this is out shined by the performances, characters, direction, arcs making for an excellent movie. 86%-A-",8,0,1,13 June 2016
