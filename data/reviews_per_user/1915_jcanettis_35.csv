The Devil's Advocate," 'Vanity Is My Favourite Sin!'
","'The Devil's Advocate' is an excellent allegoric film about human vanity and the dangerous paths it can lead. Kevin Lomax (Reeves) is a very successful lawyer in a small rural town. At some point, he finds himself in a case defending a professor accused of child molesting, whom he realizes that he is actually guilty. Despite his hesitations, he finally accepts to keep the case, and against all odds, he wins it; this immediately prompts a job offer by a big law firm in NY. As soon as he goes there with his wife Mary-Ann (Theron) he is immediately impressed and awed by his new employer firm, and especially by its charismatic yet somehow eccentric senior partner, John Milton (Pacino). Everything is very fascinating in the beginning, as Kevin and Mary-Ann are enjoying their newly acquired riches, while Kevin is speedily climbing the ladder of fame and success. However, he quickly realizes that things are not what they appear, and Milton is much more devilish than he first seemed; too devilish, in fact...Al Pacino gives a great performance as always, while Keanu Reeves is also very good in his role. However, Charlize Theron is the one who definitely steals the show, with her acting as confused and progessively destabilized Mary-Ann being really amazing; the scene in the psychiatric clinic especially, is one in which she shows her big talent. The direction is also very good, integrating the natural with the 'paranormal' elements of the film in a very concrete and effective form.There are many reasons to watch this great film; among them, I would mention Pacino's fantastic and well-placed quotes, such as: 'The virtue of the devil is in his loins!', or 'Vanity is my favourite sin!'. 9/10.",9,1,1,5 December 2004
Scarface," Somewhat Dated Perhaps, But Still Unmissable
","With so many gangster films having been released since it first appeared in 1983, 'Scarface' should perhaps be excused for bringing up a somehow dated feeling to the viewer. Stories about criminals climbing (and killing) their way to the top are not an uncommon theme in many movies; in fact, there are several masterpieces belonging in this genre, such as 'Goodfellas' and 'Once Upon A Time In America'.And yet, 'Scarface' has something original and unique in it that cannot be easily reproduced. Al Pacino is simply unforgettable as Tony Montana, the ruthless and self-destructive Cuban exile who became mighty cocaine boss in Miami, rising from obscurity as a puny dish-washer. Michelle Pfeiffer is also giving a great performance as his beautiful wife Elvira, whose life is full of vanity, coke-snorting, and boredom. The other members of the cast are also very good, with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio standing out in her role as Tony's hapless sister Gina. And finally, Brian De Palma has one of his finest hours in directing this film, which perhaps is his best so far in his career.'Scarface' is one of those unmissable films, no matter how many years pass. 9/10.",9,0,1,14 November 2004
Dead Poets Society," Truly Moving and Inspiring
","If someone has not been deeply moved and inspired by such a wonderful film as 'Dead Poets Society', I really don't know what can do the trick for him/her... 'DPS' was the nice surprise of the late 80s: Appeared out of nowhere (no big-time promotion, smallish budget, not-very-well-known actors at that time apart from Robin Williams) and instantly stole the hearts and minds of virtually everybody who watched it. Within a short while, 'carpe diem' and 'oh captain, my captain' became familiar and beloved phrases. Moreover, the film became a legend for its spirit of free-thinking and its message of 'seizing the day' and managing one's destiny.'DPS' is about a newly-arrived teacher Mr. Keating (Williams) into Welton, a traditional, respected, and rigid school in the late 50s. Not only is Mr. Keating himself a graduate from 'Hell-ton', but he is also carrying with him a free-thinking and innovative style which is utterly incompatible with the ways the Welton pupils had been used to. The professor transmits his magic to his pupils, including among others Todd Anderson (Hawke), the shy brother of a famous Welton graduate, and his room-mate, Neil Perry (Leonard), a talented boy who is kept under the wings of an oppressive father. Mr. Keating's magic transforms his boys' beliefs and ideals, but unfortunately not all good things in life last forever...Williams is simply unforgettable as Mr. Keating, a role which for many people (including me) has been forever associated with him. What is even more striking, is the astonishing performance of all the young boys: From the then-unknown Ethan Hawke, to Gale Hansen as Charlie 'Nuwanda' Dalton, and of course, to Robert Sean Leonard as Mr. Keaton's star pupil, Neil Perry.This is a movie everyone should watch: It may have no dazzling shoot-outs and special effects, star actors and sexy actresses, and all the other usual Hollywood block-buster elements, but it is one of those films that you never forget. 10/10.",10,0,1,10 October 2004
Alien," Legendary Sci-Fi Thriller
","OK, who hasn't seen 'Alien'? I believe that nearly everybody belonging to the age group of 30 - 50 (like me), have the shocking scene of the 'chestbuster' alien coming out of the poor crewman's belly forever imprinted in their minds... 'Alien' was a pioneer and trend-setter in the sci-fi thriller/horror genre, and it manages to stay that way despite 25 years of age and numerous sequels and similar films.In 'Alien', we watch the crew of spaceship Nostromo, who are on their way to Earth, eager to go to their homes, and get their pay and stock bonuses by their employing firm. However, Mother, the ship's computer, detects an SOS signal, and diverts their course completely to get them to the planet where the signal originates from; the crew has been on a hibernation-type of sleep, and wakes up completely unaware of this diversion. Grudgingly, Dallas (Skerrit), the ship's captain, with two crew members, go on an S & R mission so as to get this over with as soon as possible and leave. However, a mysterious creature (the 'alien') attacks one of them, hugging his face with its long, disgusting tentacles, and the trio rushes back to the ship in panic. Second-in-Command officer Ripley (Weaver) refuses to let them inside the main part of the ship, for quarantine purposes, but the science officer Ash (Holm) disobeys her. Things go downhill from there, as Ripley's fears about the danger prove to be well-founded, and the alien brings total havoc to the ship and crew...This is the film that made Sigourney Weaver famous, and it is true that she delivers a very good performance as heroic Ripley. Yet, I believe that there other performances are equal or even superior than hers, as for example Ian Holm's as the cold and mysterious science officer.Ridley Scott's direction is very good, with lots of impressive effects (for the 70's standards, at least). He keeps his audience on a non-stop fright journey, without letting the adrenaline down for a minute. Contrary to 'Alien 2' (I haven't seen the rest of the series) which is more of an action/adventure than of a horror/thriller film, 'Alien' is definitely a typical representative of the latter category. 8/10.",8,0,1,1 April 2005
The Godfather: Part II," One of the Greatest Sequels of All Time
","It is difficult to have a sequel which is of equal quality as compared to the original movie. This becomes nearly impossible when the original movie is an all-time classic. However, 'Godfather II' achieved just that: Both movies are 10/10, and it is absolutely difficult (and subjective) for someone to decide which of the two he/she enjoyed the most.Continuing the 'Godfather' tradition, 'Godfather II' comes with stellar performances by most of the top-notch actors we saw in the first film, with Al Pacino being first among equals. Marlon Brando is unfortunately not appearing in this one (he does not show up even in the brief flashback where James Caan does a cameo), but Robert De Niro takes his place immaculately. Do not miss 'Godafather II' (and 'Godfather I' as well) as these films have left their eternal mark in the history of cinematography.",10,0,3,29 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Too Much Hype, Little Benefit
","I think this is the most over-hyped film ever produced. Although the film has some nice effects, this fact is the only reason I gave it a slightly better than '1' grade: The plot is tiring and monotonous (Frodo being chased and running away all the time), the characters are comprehensive only to Tolkin fans (I am not one of them, and I think that the mass audience the film targets is not a Tolkin fan as well), and the ending is simply... not an ending! In other words, the movie stops abruptly waiting for you to insert DVD#2 to continue. Add to all the above the fact that we have been bombarded by heavy advertising many months before its release, and you'll figure out why I gave it a '2'.If you haven't seen the film, then the only reason I think you should do so is just to find out what the hype is (not) all about. Prepare to get disappointed, though... As far as I am concerned, I refuse to see any more films from the 'Lord' trilogy.",2,1,4,22 December 2003
The Village," Thought - Provoking
","The 'Village' is a highly interesting and thought-provoking film. Well-directed by M.N. Shyamalan, the story unfolds in what seems a common 19th century small village in the middle of a forest. This village however is different: As we learn early in the film, it is surrounded by mysterious creatures (having the apt moniker 'Those We Don't Speak Of'), who terrorize the villagers; the latter have come up with some sort of a pact with 'Those We Don't Speak Of', so that neither crosses each other's borders. In effect, the villagers are hence incarcerated, and we watch their strange life as they are cut out from the outer world.The movie studies mainly three main characters: Luscious Hunt, played well by Phoenix, a boy who talks little but is gentle and noble in his acts. Ivy Walker, a role which Bryce Howard does a great job in portraying, is a blind girl who is in love with Luscious, and displays a great deal of courage despite her disability. Finally, Noah Percy is a mentally retarded boy, who plays a key role in the sequence of events; Brody performs a very good act here.*** SPOILERS ***What raises the heat in the film, is the following: When Noah attacks and seriously injures Luscious due to his jealousy for Ivy's heart, the shattered girl asks for permission to go to the nearest town to get medicines and save her lover's life. Although her request should normally be denied, as it will violate the pact with the creatures, her father gives in, and without informing the other ruling 'Elders', he tells her the Village's great secret: Namely, that in fact everything (the Village, the creatures, and the whole setting) have simply been fabricated by him and his fellow 'Elders', as a way to escape the 21st century civilization.The reason is that all of them have suffered from crime and violence in the normal world, and so they created this habitat in the middle of a wildlife preservation (owned or sponsored by Ivy's father), so as to create a totally new society. They then invented the scary story about 'Those We Don't Speak Of', so that their children would be permanently banned from being inoculated with the 'ills' of the outer world. Ivy finally goes outside, although she is both blind and totally unprepared for the environment of 21st century life; she is simply lucky to find a guard who sympathizes with her, offers her the medicines, and helps her to get back. In her heroic journey, she gets attacked by Noah dressed in a creature suit, but manages to kill him. The film ends with Ivy giving the medicines to her lover, while the 'Elders' consider Noah's death (whom everyone bar them believes it was a wild creature), as the fact that will now make their story fully bullet-proof, and therefore their 'Village' will be able to incarcerate its villagers indefinitely.I have found the movie incredibly thought-provoking. It is interesting how these people decided to fight society's ills (from which all have suffered, by losing friends and relatives from crime), by creating an even bigger one: They took the fatal decision of creating this isolated Village-Prison, in which they watched their children suffer and die from illnesses and disabilities, while they were unwilling to provide them any professional help or treatment from the outer world just because they wanted to preserve their fabrication. Moreover, they preferred to have everyone live in a big lie, rather than go to the real world (no matter how difficult that would be) and face it. They stuck to this until the very end, determined to pursue the wicked goal at any cost.A story that makes you pause and think. 9/10.",9,0,0,13 February 2005
Apocalypse Now," One of the Best Films In the History of Cinema
","It is difficult for me to write a comment for 'Apocalypse Now'. The numerous reviews that have been made by prestigious critics and experts about this monumental film since its release, make my comments seem a bit redundant. Nevertheless, I strongly feel obliged to submit some thoughts about this fantastic movie.First of all, I subscribe to the view expressed by many, that 'Apocalypse Now' is one of the best films in the history of cinema. It combines many things: Drama, action, emotions, art, mysticism, scenery, philosophy, are some elements that come in mind when one talks about 'AN'. In fact, there are so many angles that this film can been seen through, that it is nearly impossible to categorize it: Is it a war film? Is it a philosophical one? Is it an art movie? 'AN' partially fits in lots of categories, and doesn't fully fit in any one of them at the same time...Under the masterful direction of Coppola, 'AN' recounts the story of Capt. Willard (Sheen), who while serving in Vietnam, is ordered to carry out a rather unconventional mission: He must find and 'terminate' Col. Kurz (Brando), an erstwhile brilliant officer, who has now gone insane; Kurz has gathered a private 'army' by locals who worship him like a god, and he has disappeared with them somewhere in Cambodia. Willard begins his journey with a handful of accompanying sailors, and during their voyage they encounter several surreal situations. Moreover, Willard, who is in the border of insanity himself, studies the file of Kurz and starts to deeply admire the man. What will happen when he finally meets him?I wouldn't need here to say anything about the breath-taking performances of Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando, as they are the point of reference for many drama classes. I would only like to add that ALL the performances in 'AN', are worthy of the film's status.There many things to be said about 'AN', and as I explained in the beginning, if someone wants to explore further, there are several sources to look at. The only thing I would like to add here before concluding is that this is a film which will never lose its beauty, no matter how many years pass. 10/10.",10,4,5,17 October 2005
In the Name of the Father," Extremeley Powerful, With Superb Performances
","A film fully deserving to be in IMDb's top 250, Jim Sheridan's 'In The Name of the Father' is an excellent piece of work. Based on a true and very touching story, the film recounts the story of Gerry Conlon (Day-Lewis) who is wrongly accused as an IRA terrorist. Not only are the police bending the facts to prove their case, but in the process they also implicate members of his friends and family, including his father Giuseppe (Postlethwaithe) whose health condition is rather frail. Gerry is a rebellious and mildly delinquent boy who does not seem to have grown up, and his attitude toward his father is not the appropriate one; however, as they start to go through the ordeal together, Gerry gradually matures, and starts feeling a deep affection and respect for Giuseppe.The story is heart-breaking and shocking at the same time, all the more so when one realizes that these things actually DID happen. Although there have been some minor modifications for the purpose of the film, the backbone of the story is left completely intact.The two protagonists, Daniel Day-Liewis and Pete Postlethwaithe are delivering powerful performances, and they both deserved the Oscar hands-down. However, it would be unfair not to mention that virtually everyone in the film is great in his/her role.Jim Sheridan's direction is also very good, giving the plot a fair and balanced perspective; although the film might initially appear as pro-Irish / anti-English, in fact I consider it as quite objective. Granted, it vividly shows that some key figures in the London police were profoundly biased and manipulated maliciously the case against the Conlons; yet, it also shows that English public attitudes turned highly supportive for the Conlons' freedom when it started to become clear that they were not the culprits for the atrocities they had been charged with. We have always to remember that the film depicts a period of big tensions, with emotions running high to levels of hysteria, so we have to understand the events within this context.Of course, what happened to the Conlons is totally deplorable and unjustifiable; and it is real shame that the people who conspired against them have not been punished yet for their crimes. Still, one should understand the hostile attitude shown by those who were not part of this conspiracy (such as the judge, for example), who were influenced by the climate of terror and the outrage of the public. The Conlons had the terribly bad luck to be at the wrong place, in the wrong time, and with the wrong nationality; the also have the great misfortune to be captured by people who in their quest to show results were shamelessly willing to risk indicting people who could possibly be innocent.'In the Name of the Father' is a fantastic film, which one should not miss. 10/10.",10,114,123,2 September 2005
Being John Malkovich," A Film That Leaves You With Mixed Emotions
","'Being John Malkovic' is certainly not a typical film. On the contrary, the ingeniuity of its plot is definitely its most strong point: A loser puppeteer who discovers a portal who makes people get into John Malkovic's brain, is persuaded by his evil colleague Maxine with whom he has fallen in (one-way) love with, to turn it into a profitable business. However, things get much more complicated when his hippy and animal-loving wife enters the portal and finds out that she has the hots for Maxine too! And this is just the beginning of the story, with more twists to follow later... However, ingenious the scenario might be, it gets at some point a bit over-stretched. The result is that when the movie ends, you are a bit overwhelmed with what you have just watched, and you are left with mixed emotions. This does not mean that the movie is not good: The performance of all the actors is great (with Malkovic being an excellent... Malkovic!), whereas the movie certainly does not let you get bored as the plot develops at a fast pace. The movie gets a 7/10 overall.",7,0,1,30 January 2004
Aliens," Not Like The First of the Series, But Still Very Good
","I have only seen the first two of the 'Alien' series, so my comments on both films are within this context. Despite being a sequel with a time gap that cannot be considered wide (1979 to 1986), I found the two films quite different in both style and essence: Whereas Ridley Scott in 'Alien' made a typical thriller, James Cameron came up with a movie in which the focus was much more on the action and less on suspense.In 'Alien', we saw one by one the crew members of Nostromo getting killed by the mysterious and cryptic alien in a slow and painful pace (until the last scenes at least, where the tempo goes up). In 'Aliens', the theme is completely different: Ripley (Weaver) is persuaded to return to the planet, which has been colonized by humans who are unaware of the lethal danger, and who have now faced the wrath and terrorizing of the aliens who inhabit there. The Company also sends a team of Space Marines with heavy fire power (with Ripley acting as their adviser), in order to clean up the place. As soon as the squad lands onto the unfriendly territory, the action begins: The aliens are tough nuts, and a devastating war between the two species takes place.Contrary to the first film, 'Aliens' is full of overwhelming sci-fi action, putting the film in the same category as say, the Star Wars saga (although the scenes in 'Aliens' are much more brutal and horrific). Moreover, although 'Alien' was a much more genuine and pioneer film, in 'Aliens' I didn't get this feeling (although the fact that it was a sequel is in part responsible for this).This does not mean that 'Aliens' is not good. On the contrary, it provides us with vivid action, solid performances, stunning effects (for the 80's standards), and a very good direction. Yet, I can't help but give it a slightly lower grade than the superb 'Alien'. Overall mark 7/10.",7,0,2,1 April 2005
The Usual Suspects," A Must-See Classic
","When I first saw 'The Usual Suspects', the film had just been released out in the theaters without much fanfare. I went to see it due to a lack of alternatives, as it seemed to be just a 'kill 2 hours of your time' thing.However, I now feel very privileged for being one of those who had the luck to enjoy this fantastic movie before the hype about it started to appear; this fact enabled me to view it in a very sober and critical way. Needless to say that I went out of the theater stunned, as this was one of the best films I had ever seen. After a while, everybody was talking about 'Usual Suspects' and I went to see it again in order to see some things in a new light since I now knew the ending.If you haven't seen 'Usual Suspects', then you should not miss it. It is a great film, whose greatest asset is its plot: It develops smoothly, and in the end everything turns upside-down, making you think 'Hell, why didn't I think of that?'.The scenario is not the only reason you should see this movie, though: The characters are well-portrayed (with Oscar-winning Kevin Spacey at his forte), the action is fast, and the you will be kept tense throughout the whole movie. In brief, these will be 2 hours very well spent!",10,0,1,19 December 2003
The Butterfly Effect," Good Idea, Complicated Implementation
","'The Butterfly Effect' is not a typical movie. With its weird story, its many and sometimes difficult to follow plot twists, its dark and depressing atmosphere, it definitely is a film which can be described as 'different'. But is it also good?The answer to the above question is not easy. The idea that the 'TBF' plays with is clever, that's for sure: The story is about Evan Treborn (Kutcher), a boy who faces mysterious memory black-outs when faced with unhappy events. Doctors attribute this to stress, although his mother (Walters) suspects that this might be related to his hospitalized father's mental illness. Things get really nasty though, when a mischief conducted by him, his friend Kay (Smart), her brother Tommy (Scott), and their friend Lenny (Henson), goes really awry. This event makes the life of everyone take a dramatic turn, but the problem is that Evan (and the viewer), have no clue of what happened due to a black-out he faced. Then suddenly after many years, Evan discovers that there is a way to reveal his lost memories; however, this brings some unintended and strange side-effects...If this sounds a bit confusing, then rest assured that it is much more complicated than that; in fact, the main weakness of the film is that although it is based on a very good idea, the scenario gets too complicated and over-stretched. If it was kept a bit 'lighter', then I would sure grade the movie 2 notches higher in the 10-point grade scale than the 6/10 grade I have given it.The performances are more than satisfactory, especially if you take into account the fact that there are no grand names involved. So is the direction, despite the difficulty posed by the frequent flash-backs and twists that are required by the scenario.In brief, the film is overall OK, but had the potential for meeting even higher expectations.",6,6,12,1 November 2004
Man on the Moon," A Talented Man That Brings You Strong and Contradictory Emotions
","Before seeing 'Man on the Moon' I had never heard before about Andy Kaufman. By reading some comments and plot outlines, I got the impression that this was simply another celebrity guy who projected an aura of eccentricity just to raise his publicity level (like quite many stars do).However, I have to admit that watching 'Man of the Moon' was definitely a shock. Portrayed fantastically by Jim Carrey (which gives an Oscar-worthy performance, here), this is a story of a talented man that brings you strong and contradictory emotions: At one point he can make you laugh, at another he can (intentionally) bore you to death; at one point he can make you berserk with his vulgar and rude jokes, at another you can become deeply touched by his strength and willingness to live and entertain his audience despite his grave illness. Andy Kaufman was truly a special man, who did not conform to any norms or rules of society, but whose sole purpose in life was to produce laughter with his own twisted way: Even if the product of his acts was not laughter but boredom, anger, or insult, he still was happy with himself as he thought he was doing the right thing.The film is neither trying to make a hero out of Kaufman, nor a villain out of him; it depicts him in an objective way, leaving the viewer to decide for himself about what kind of man Kaufman really was. As I noted previously, Carrey does a stunning act as Kaufman; an example that shows how he wanted to identify with his role, is that during the filming he insisted to be called 'Andy Kaufman' both on and off stage! (I read this in the IMDb trivia).The rest of the crew are also superb, and the fact that some actors come from Kaufman's real-life circle brings an air of greater authenticity. Forman's direction is also up to the task.Either you already know about Kaufman, or not (like me), I strongly suggest you see this movie. 8/10.",8,0,0,23 May 2005
28 Days Later...," Generally Good, But With Plot Gaps
","'28 Days Later...' succeeds in its basic target: To provide two enjoyable hours to its audience, full of suspense and action. Although it is a film that is characterized under the 'Horror' category, it does not overwhelm the viewer with unnecessary and tiring gory scenes; instead, the director manages to achieve the horror element mainly through the psychological pressure that the plot generates. There are some quite scary and bloody scenes, yes, but they are not dominant in the movie; the fear, distress, and panic of the characters is what raises our adrenaline.So what is '28 Days Later...' about? The story is as follows: An unknown and highly contagious virus escapes a research lab, and it quickly produces an epidemic. The people infected by it enter a state of murderous and destructive rage, becoming in effect a form of killer-zombies. Within 28 days, when the civilization seems to have been fatally shattered, Jim (Murphy), a hospital patient who was in a coma due to an accident, wakes up and discovers a totally new world surrounding him. He begins a quest to find other uninfected survivors, of which there are unfortunately very few. In the process, he and his companions realize that there are more dangers in this new environment than simply the virus itself...Although the story is interesting, it has the problem that it features some disturbing gaps that cannot stand to some scrutiny. I do not want to enter into much detail here, as I will have to reveal spoilers, but what I can safely mention, without revealing the plot, is the following: The main point of the storyline is that the infected are portrayed as zombies who have no consciousness or logic at all, but their only activity is to massacre in a raving state whoever is near them; they do not eat, drink, or perform any basic human function. However, the above fact should mean that these zombie-people would be  totally unable to group together and attack others; instead, it is rational to assume that they would simply start eliminating each other, while their lack of reason and functional capabilities would make them easy prey to the rest of humanity who would probably isolate and cure or annihilate them without letting the damage spread for long. This is not what happens in the film however, as we see an unlikely scenario in which these infected zombies not only manage to devastate an entire civilized country without anyone being able to stop them, but they also form groups and attack our heroes in unison in occasional scenes.Despite these gaps, the film overall manages well. The actors, although not widely known, perform fine. The scenery, and especially the portrayals of the empty city streets and buildings, are fascinating, despite the production's low budget. A 7/10 is a fair grade in my opinion.",7,1,2,23 July 2004
City of God," A True Story Very Well Told
","When I decided to watch 'Cidade de Deus', I was rather hesitant. Although I had heard positive comments for the film, there were several things that were putting me off: The shoot-em-up story did not sound original, the actors were amateur, the language and location were not so familiar. However I devided to give it a try.Well, it proved to be a very wise move by my side: 'Cidade de Deus' is simply an excellent film. The story might not be that original but is very interesting and very well-told. The 'amateur' actors are superb, and perform much better than many professional ones. The language and location may not sound familiar at the beginning, but the masterful director soon gets you quickly entwined with the environment; in fact, he is maybe the greatest asset of this production, as he does an excellent job in providing us with a top-notch direction.What you see is sometimes so surreal (a poor ghetto community totally isolated from the 'normal' parts of Brazil, small children toying with drugs and guns, people showing a complete lack of respect for human life, etc.) that you tend to think it is a bit exaggerated. Sadly, it is not: The story is true, and many if the actors that play in it are actual inhabitants of this kind of ghetto communities. The film should awake many of us who sometimes tend to feel that our comfortable lives are the norm in this world, when in fact they are rather the exception.'Cidade de Deus' gets a 9/10 by me.",9,0,2,20 February 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Clint Eastwood Displays His Talent Again
","I really consider Clint Eastwood as one of the most charismatic persons of the film industry. While starting up with macho roles in movies like 'Dirty Hurry' and 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly', he completely changed course later on and started doing very sophisticated, and even art, films, such as 'Mystic River' and 'Bird'.'Million Dollar Baby' is a prime example of Clistwood's genius. The story is about Maggie (Swank), a female boxer, who has nothing else in her life than her boxing talent. Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is a tired, old coach, whom she approaches and he grudgingly decides to take her after Eddie 'Scrup-Iron' (Freeman), his assistant and pal, persuades him to. The girl proves to be a very promising athlete, and she climbs the ladder of success very swiftly. Frankie starts to feel very close with her, as she reminds him of his long-gone daughter. Things however get very nasty when Maggie suffers from a serious accident, and everything now gets turned upside down...All the Oscars in this film (nominations and winnings), are well deserved: Eastwood provides us with an A-class direction, as he portrays us a dark world of losers where boxing is their only way for them to feel they have a purpose in life. The leading trio (Eastwood, Swank, Freeman) are so superb in their roles, that it is almost impossible for me to distinguish among them. All in all, the film describes a sad story, very well told, which cannot leave you untouched. 9/10.",9,4,5,12 April 2005
Mulholland Drive," A Film That Blows Your Mind
","Here is a film that will leave you wondering of what has really happened in it, and yet keep you highly amazed and excited. David Lynch has achieved this difficult combination with his masterpiece 'Mulholland Drive'.The story in the beginning is quite straightforward: A girl (Harring) narrowly escapes her murder thanks to a car accident that kills her would-be killers. However, the accident brings amnesia to her, so she wanders aimlessly around, until she finds refuge to a house. In this house, Betty, an aspiring young actress (Watts) takes her under her protection and tries to help her find out what has happened. From some point onward, however, nothing is straightforward anymore: Who is really the girl? Who is really Betty? How are the two of them connected? The movie is open to several interpretations, but after reading some excellent IMDb message board postings, it was easy for me to come up with a solid conclusion of what has really happened. Of course, I am not going to reveal it here, as I will spoil the magic of this excellent film! What I can say however, is that David Lynch has produced a film that is full of symbolism, hidden clues, and art. Although it is basically a 'crime' film, in practice it is far beyond that. Dream and reality are intertwined, and in the end everything is turned upside down.The performances of the two lead actresses could not be better suited for this film: They are both excellent and fit perfectly in their roles. Of course, acting is good across the board, as well.Lynch's definitely best movie: 10/10.",10,2,4,13 July 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," So, Does Gore Sell So Much?
","I really cannot understand why films like 'Kill Bill' which are based on so much blood and gore are so popular... 'Kill Bill' in particular, is 90% ugly scenes and 10% anything else. What is exactly interesting or artful in watching a comatose girl being raped, and then seeing her bite the tongue out of her rapist's mouth?In order to be fair, I must accept that the direction of the film is good. But what difference does this make, when the film in itself is completely unwatchable? I don't object to bloody scenes being shown in a film, provided that they serve some purpose in the plot, and they do not constitute the film's purpose instead (as it happens here).In brief, I find Tarantino completely overrated; what's more, in this film he goes way too low even by his standards. If 'Kill Bill' wasn't directed by him, and no stars appeared in it, it would be a typical B-movie. Needless to say, I won't even think about watching Vol. 2. Verdict: 3/10.",3,8,13,19 November 2004
Once Upon a Time in America," A Great Film
","'Once Upon a Time in America' is simply a great film. The plot follows the lives of the close-knit members of a gang, from their early childhood to their late sixties. We see their relationships and interactions while they slip ever more deeply into their criminal ways, with the main focus being on 'Noodles' (Robert De Niro), who has a love-hate relationship with the gang leader 'Max' (James Woods), and an unfulfilled passion for the sister of one of the gang accomplices.The story combines drama, action, violence (occasionally heavy), and emotion. All the actors are excellent in their roles, and De Niro is once again worthy of his name. The fact the the movie is a long one (more than 3 hrs.) does not make it boring at all, as the action is generally rolling fast.If 'Once Upon a Time in America' is not a 10/10 movie, then I don't know which one is. Don't miss it.",10,1,4,13 February 2004
Victory," Decent Movie Featuring Terrific Football
","If the part where the football match takes place was omitted, 'Victory' would be a '5 stars out of 10' film. The reason is that although it features two very good actors (Michael Caine - Max von Sydow), there is not much to stand out: A rather incredulous WW2 plot, an average acting (what could you expect from professional footballers or from Stallone?), and a simply decent direction, produce an average result. Thankfully, there is more than that, as I will explain in more detail later.'Victory' is about some inmates in a WW2 prison camp, who have a passion for soccer. Captain J. Colby (Caine), a former footballer, is the leading figure in the camp matches that take place. One day, he is spotted by football-fan Major Steiner (Max von Sydow) who proposes him the idea of organizing a match between allied POWs vs. Germans. Colby agrees, as he believes this will be a great morale-booster and a chance for better prison conditions for those involved; however, more senior inmates are skeptical, as they believe this will be a propaganda stunt for the Germans. In the end, they also concur but only after they have convinced the team's goalie Capt. Hatch (Stallone) to arrange the team's escape during the match. The difficulty is that both Colby and his team are more interested in this game than in their freedom, so they are hesitant on what they should finally do...As I said, the movie is just watchable during its first part. And yet, when we start to watch the Allied - Germans match, things get much better: We watch terrific football from stars such as Pele, Ardiles, and Bobby Moore, with scenes such as Pele's goal being memorable to all sports fans. Of course, if you are not into soccer, then perhaps you won't get that excited (although the spectacle can be exciting for non-fans, too). But if you like the King of Sports, then you will certainly enjoy this film. 7/10.",7,16,21,22 October 2005
The Last Samurai," A Wonderful Epic
","'The Last Samurai' is a wonderful epic. The story is about the tale of American army captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) who is sent to Japan in the 18th century, in order to help the emperor train his army and crash a rebellion by disobedient Samurais who straggle to retain the country's cultural purity; Algren's experience in fighting native Indians is considered his 'asset' for his task. Things begin to work out very differently however, when Algren gets captured by the Samurais, and begins to admire their mission, code of ethics, and way of life.Tom Cruise is astonishing in his touching and grandiose role as Captain Algren, whom we watch transform gradually from a wrecked, semi-alcoholic, and nihilistic person, into an honorable, energetic, and passionate Samurai. The parallels with Kevin Kostner in 'Dances With Wolves' are inescapable, but the difference here is that the norms and customs of the tribe that Algren joins (the Japanese Samurai) are far less familiar to the Western public, and this gives an extra exotic 'plus' to the film. The performance of the other actors is also superb, but for me the greatest impact was made by Ken Watanabe as legendary Katsumoto.'The Last Samurai' has all the necessary ingredients of a great epic: Drama, emotion, action, war, heroism, and love. The high-class photography, scenery, and costumes, complete the perfection. 9/10.",9,1,2,22 February 2004
Life Is Beautiful," Makes You Laugh and Cry
","There have been numerous films about the Holocaust: A few of them were mediocre, many of them good, and a few were real masterpieces (with 'Schindler's List' topping the latter league). However, in my humble opinion, 'La Vita e Bella' deserves special praise because it is truly unique in its approach of this great historical tragedy: More specifically, the movie manages artfully to make you occasionally laugh loudly, while on the same time it keeps this grave horror in its proper perspective, and therefore makes you cry; especially in the end, it makes you cry fiercely.The actors' performances are great, with Roberto Benigni being simply superb in his role of the straggling father, who despite his agony and suffering, cleverly manages to portray the concentration camp as a game to his son, in order to protect him from realizing the terror he is in.Although some things are a bit oversimplified (e.g., the camp is depicted as place where the main problem is not the death but the hard work, without showing pictures of harassed and degraded inmates), this approach is followed in order to keep the balance explained in the beginning of this critique: 'La Vita e Bella' tries to tell us a very serious story, yet it also tries to remind us that we have to keep our mood always positive, no matter the circumstances, and then we might have a chance to get away with it. Little Joshua can tell you more about how to do it... A 9/10 film.",9,2,5,29 March 2004
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's Only Interesting Movie
","I really find Tarantino totally overrated: He tries to make an impact by overwhelming his audience with unbelievably gory scenes, while his films lack any substantial and interesting element; the 'Kill Bill' series are a prime example of this lame strategy. However, there is one single exception to the above: 'Reservoir Dogs'.To start with, 'Reservoir Dogs' still has the necessary Tarantinesque blood galore and shocking scenes, although these are more limited compared to his other films. Moreover, blood is not what makes 'RD' stand out: Instead, the film has a very distinct style, as it depicts the characters of the movie in a very ordinary, 'next-door-guy' style, while they commit not-so-ordinary crimes. The dialogs, the setting, the suspense, everything is very simple and yet very different in its way, as the film has a structure which is elementary yet intriguing. The plot is also quite simple (five strangers perform a bank robbery and then try to find a rat among them), yet it achieves to keep our interest in high levels until the very end. The performances are good, with Harvey Kaitel being first among equals.Pity that Tarantino did not make any other movies like this one. 8/10.",8,3,5,23 December 2004
Inside Man," Very Original Hostage-Crisis Thriller
","At first sight, 'Inside Man' does not seem very original: The plot is about a gang of bank robbers led by Dalton Russel (Owen), who use hostages as leverage towards the police. And yet, as the movie progresses we realize that originality is one of the biggest pluses of the film: We soon begin to suspect that the robbers are after something different than the bank's cash, something that the bank's chairman (Plummer) is willing to do anything to protect it, and to this end he plants Madeleine White (Foster), an enigmatic figure, into the scene. This interference displeases Detective Frazier (Washington) who is in charge of solving the case, as he believes that her presence will make his task harder. Eventually, everybody becomes entangled in a complex web with unpredictable consequences...Spike Lee has undeniably succeeded in turning a seemingly typical crime film into something much more intriguing. I subscribe to the view expressed by many that this is by far his best and most mature work to date. He manages to keep the tensions high without resorting to extremities, and he also aptly introduces key plot twists that keep us continuously excited. I also enjoyed his portrayal of characters, in which he carefully avoids to grant 'hero' status to anyone (not even to Det. Frezier who is arguably the 'good' guy of the film), but instead exposes each one's flaws in an objective and realistic manner.As far acting is concerned, Clive Owen is the big winner here. His performance as the sly and ruthless gang leader is superb, and I definitely value him much higher after seeing this film. Jodie Foster and Denzel Washington are also very good in their respective roles, while Christofer Plummer and Willem Dafoe (who plays the role of a police captain) have small yet significant appearances in the film.In brief, 'Inside Man' is a solid and very original work by Spike Lee which well-deserves 8/10.",8,2,3,30 April 2006
The Da Vinci Code," An Excellent Adaptation of An Excellent Book
","When a book like 'Da Vinci Code' needs to be adapted to the big screen, the task is usually extremely difficult. The 'Da Vinci Code' book is not only a great thriller, but it also fascinates the reader with the abundance of puzzles, trivia, and historical information that it contains. But above all, it is a book which raises an alternative version regarding the roots of Christianity: Whether this version is right or wrong is irrelevant here; Dan Brown provides the reader with an opinion, and it is up to the reader himself to decide the true version of events.Given that 'Da Vinci Code' is such a complex book, does it have any chance to succeed in the big screen? Fortunately for us, the answer is a solid yes! Although I went to watch the film rather reserved, bracing myself for a big anticlimax, I was very positively surprised to see that Ron Howard has done a great job. The 'Da Vinci Code' film is as close to the 'Da Vinci Code' book as it gets. The plot follows loyally the book's story, and more importantly, the overall atmosphere is exactly what one would expect after having read the novel.As far as the characters are concerned, I believe that each of the protagonists has been correctly cast to perform his/her role: Tom Hanks is quite convincing as the investigative professor Langdon; although I thought him to be a bit misplaced for this role when I first heard that he was the one to take it, I was utterly relieved to be proved wrong to be skeptical. His screen partner, Audrey Tautou, is also very good as the charming cryptanalyst Sophie Nevau.Ian McKellen and Jean Reno are definitely the best choices for their respective roles: It would not be an exaggeration if I said that when I read the book I imagined the looks and styles of Sir Lee and Captain Fache as being quite similar to the ones of the two actors. Both of them make a perfect fit in their roles.Finally, Paul Bettany plays the difficult role of Silas more than satisfactorily.All in all, the film is very impressive, and as I said previously, it follows the book loyally. Hard-core book fans might be disappointed, as a film can never capture everything a book contains: However, these people should not watch the film at all, as they are bound to be disappointed no matter what. For the rest of us, who enjoyed the book and wished for a good film to complement it, 'Da Vinci Code' is what we wanted: 9/10.",9,3,7,20 May 2006
The Untouchables," Brian De Palma's Masterpiece
","'The Untouchables' is in my opinion De Palma's greatest work, with his other masterpiece, namely 'Scarface', coming a very close second. In 'Scarface' the focus is on a paranoid and self-destructive gangster who rises to meteoric heights and then falls; in 'The Untouchables' the focus is on a very honest man with a noble mission, Elliot Ness (Kostner), who is prepared to do anything to clean Chicago from the corruption and mayhem caused by the notorious gangster Al Capone (De Niro). His quest is really tough, as his opponent is determined and powerful, but he has the help of three invaluable partners: Malone (Connery), a no-nonsense experienced cop, Wallace (Martin Smith), an accountant who will try to help bring tax charges against Capone, and Stone (Garcia), a great shooter.As I noted before the film is brilliantly directed, with some scenes such as the one with the baseball bat, or the one with the baby in the train station, having become classic. The acting is superb, and while Connery was the one who received his well-deserved Oscar, Kostner and De Niro made Oscar-class performances too.Although belonging to a typical genre, this film certainly stands out. Don't miss it! 10/10.",10,144,228,30 January 2005
The Godfather: Part III," Very Good, But Lacks The Magic of I & II
","Viewed in isolation, 'Godfather III' is a very good film. The plot is interesting: The Corleone empire tries expand into legitimate business via its connections with the Vatican, as Don Michael Corleone (Pacino) wants to convert into a clean life, something he always promised but never managed; in his quest, he is assisted by Sonny's illegitimate child Vinni (Garcia), who is in love with his cousin Mary (Coppola), Michael's daughter. However things turn sour as there are powerful enemies who also want a share of the pricey spoils originating from this grand deal.The film manages to keep the mystifying atmosphere and intrigue that we are used to in the 'Godfather' saga. Moreover, the overall acting ranges from superb (Pacino) to very good (Garcia), with Sophia Coppola being the only unsatisfactory exception. So far, so good.Yet, 'Godfather III' can by no means be treated equally as 'G1' and 'G2': Although 'G3' is a very good, 8/10 film, the first two parts were movies with a special magic for which even the 10/10 grade seemed insufficient.Somebody in this site suggested that the Godfather epic should finish with the touching last scene in 'G2', in which we watch Michael, who after ordering Fredo's death, he stands lonely and miserably, pondering a family flashback. I have to admit that up to a point I could subscribe to this point of view; Perhaps the 'Godfather' saga could have finished there. Still, I am not so sure: After all, it is fair to say that 'G3' connects nicely to the previous parts, and although it lacks their magic, it is still a very good movie. After all, the last scene of 'G3' is quite touching as well...",8,0,1,5 September 2004
To Kill a Mockingbird," It's a Classic, But...
","...to be honest I expected a bit more: Having heard so much praise for 'To Kill A Mockingbird' since my childhood, and with the added fact that it enjoys a permanent position in IMDb's top 250, I had very high expectations for this classic film. However, when I recently watched it, I was somewhat deflated: Expecting a 9/10 or 10/10 film, I could barely give it a 7/10. Here is why:'TKAM' is about the story of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), an idealistic lawyer in America's South, who defends a wrongly accused black man (B. Peters) during the depression era; his passionate defense drives him to face the hostility of his racist fellow citizens. Although the story sounds like a courtroom drama, in fact it is hardly such: The plot revolves around the everyday life of the two little kids of Finch (M. Badham and P. Alford), with the trial being rather out of focus, and portrayed in a piecemeal way.This last point is the grave weakness of the film, at least in my humble opinion. Everything else is fine: The acting is superb (with the two children definitely stealing the show, despite Peck's indisputable calibre), the atmosphere of the small city is skillfully presented, and of course, the anti-racist message of the movie is powerful. Yet, the problem is that 'TKAM' continuously preoccupies us with the children's games and mischiefs, thus distracting us from following soberly (a) the capture and trial of the accused man, (b) the clash between Finch and his co-villagers, and (c) the clarification of what finally happened and who is responsible. In other words, the film fails to keep the focus on where I believe it should remain from the beginning to end: Finch, the defendant, and the community.I am aware that at the time when this film was produced (early sixties), the issue of racism was still considered a taboo, and thus the launch of 'TKAM' probably would touch sensitive cords; perhaps this explains the rather childish and melodramatic approach used by its producers, as they were possibly trying to take off some heat from its core message. This might be OK for the sixties, seventies, or even eighties. Yet, by watching it in 2004, I definitely left only partially satisfied. 'TKAM' is a classic, yes: But if it had been produced today from scratch, I believe it would be much more focused and coherent.",7,2,6,4 May 2004
Downfall," Trylly Compelling and Realistic!
","I have seen quite many WW2 films in the past, yet very few of them managed to amaze and shock me as 'Der Untergang' did. Under Oliver Hirschbiegel's excellent direction, we watch the agonizing last hours inside Hitler's bunker, as accounted for by his young secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara). We watch Hitler (Bruno Ganz), in his peak of his insanity, as he awaits for imaginary troops to save him and his motherland, while his closest associates start to realize that the game is over and begin to desert him en masse. We watch Eva Brown (Juliane Kohler), who amidst the turmoil and destruction, her main preoccupation is to die looking beautiful, so she chooses the poison instead of the bullet. We watch Frau Goebells (Corinna Harfouch) who prefers to have her children killed than live in a world of 'decadants'. All in all, we watch the members of the Nazi elite and their entourage spending their last moments awaiting their well-deserved fate, with their reactions varying from binge drinking to committing suicide.Bruno Ganz delivers an amazing performance definitely worthy of an Oscar. He is amazing as Hitler, switching from manic and hysterical to sweet and caring, in an a paranoid way. The other members of the cast are also doing a great job, portraying the personalities of that time in a highly realistic way. The fact that the dialogs are in German adds to the astonishing realism of the film even more, making it look like a professional documentary.Some people accused the film for displaying Hitler in a more 'humane' manner than appropriate. I definitely disagree with the accusation: Hitler is not displayed as humane; he is simply portrayed exactly as he was, namely a paranoid and ruthless fanatic, yet who had also some moments in which he displayed compassion and fondness. The whole point is to see this monstrous personality exactly as he was, and not try to conceal some aspects of his character in the name of political correctness; Hirschbiegel deserves credit for achieving this difficult goal immaculately.'Der Untergang' is a 10/10 film which everyone should watch.",10,4,8,7 May 2005
Lord of War," A Powerful Depiction of The Dark World of Arms Dealers
","The 'Lord of War' offers us a powerful depiction of the dark world of the global weapons-smuggling. It follows the story of Yuri Orlov (Cage), a poor Ukrainian immigrant, who one day decides to sell guns for a living. Starting as a small fry, and derided by his 'competitors' such as the powerful dealer Simeon Weisz (Holm), Orlov soon discovers that he has a talent for this job, and he takes full advantage of it. His brother Vitaly who had started along with him soon realizes that he cannot follow his brother's fast and steady ascendancy, and Yuri goes all way towards the top alone; even his beautiful and beloved wife Ava (Moynahan) is not aware of her husband's business activities. Yuri Orlov seems unassailable, and only Agent Jack Valentine (Hawke) looks determined to stop him...Apart from the top-notch performances and the exciting plot, the film offers us something far beyond that: It serves as a resourceful documentary regarding the weapons trade, giving us insight on the machinations, back-room deals, and style of the people involved in this ugly business.What is interesting, is that Orlov is not portrayed as an evil man: He is simply portrayed as someone completely amoral and detached from the evil activity he is engaged in. This approach to be very realistic and persuasive to the viewer, as it avoids the clichés that a typical 'bad guy' would produce.Director A. Niccol has done a very good work throughout the whole movie. His highest moment by far however, is the introduction where we follow the 'life' of a bullet from the factory to the victim! 8/10.",8,0,0,4 January 2007
Carrie," More of a Good Drama Than of A Horror/Thriller
","When I first saw 'Carrie', I expected to watch a different type of film. By having read the plot outline and some reviews, I had prepared myself to watch a thriller. Yet, I discovered that 'Carrie', although it contains typical horror/thriller elements (such as frightening scenes, at least for the '70s standards), is actually is a drama; a good drama, in fact.The story revolves around an introvert and shy girl, Carrie (Spacek), who faces the sarcasm and teasing of her schoolmates. Moreover, the poor girl cannot even find peace at home, as she has a tyrannic mother (Laurie) who is obsessed with religion at the border of madness. When Carrie gets invited at the school prom by a charming boy, things for the first time seem to be going well for her. Yet, everything gets spoiled, as the arch-brat of the school, Chris (Allen), decides to play a very dirty and humiliating trick to her. Carrie, who has telekinetic powers, but who until this point has not actually used them on purpose, goes berserk, and things start to really go wild from here...Brian de Palma does a good job in focusing on the hardships that poor Carrie endures, and how these affect her personality. I found the first scene (where Carrie has her period and gets ridiculed by the other girls) especially disturbing, as it shows vividly how her environment treats her in the most inhuman and mean way. As a matter of fact, I believe that the point of the film has been to primarily portray the multiple psychological traumas that Carrie faces, rather than focus on her telekinetic abilities or her revenge. And this is actually the strongest point of the film: One cannot help but be deeply touched by the outstanding performance of Sissy Spacek, whom we watch going through her cruel ordeal.The other performances range from good (Buckley) to average (Allen, Travolta, Irving). Finally, Piper Laurie is very good as the evil mother.All in all, 7/10.",7,1,3,24 March 2005
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The Mother of All Horror Films
","'A Nightmare on Elm Street' deserves hands-down the title of The Mother of All Horror Films. The reason for the above title does not stem from the film's casting; the actors do perform quite well, but we have definitely seen better. Nor is it for the plot; although the story is quite innovative and scary, it suffers from some major gaps. Is it the special FX then which do the trick? Well, they were certainly impressive for the 80s, but they cannot stand up to the competition in today's digital and hi-tech era. So it must be the direction, right? Well, yes and no: Wes Craven does a fine job, but that alone is not a sufficient condition for the title.What is it then? What does 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' make it so special? The answer is simple: Its cult status. Within a short period from its release, the movie became a legend, with Freddie Krueger (Robert Englund) being a familiar figure to virtually everyone. His knife-laden hands have claimed some good scares from frightened fans, that's for sure!The amazing success was totally unexpected even for New Line Cinema, the production company, whose people could never imagine that they would come up with, well, The Mother of All Horror Films! They tried to capitalize on their great fortune by producing numerous sequels, yet none had the flair and originality of this film.I am not a horror movie fan in general, and yet I value this film very highly: It has something truly unique, and despite the 20 years that have passed since its release, its flame is still bright. If you are willing to get a really scary ride, then don't miss it: 8/10.",8,0,0,28 November 2004
Sin City," Ultra-Violent, Weird, But Still a Great Experience!
","In general, I utterly dislike films containing too much violence. The 'Tarantino school', as I call it, is for me a cheap way to try to catch the viewer's attention by using unnecessary and disgusting gory scenes. In the same way that other directors try to draw our interest by using nude or sexy scenes (these at least are much more enjoyable to watch!), the 'Tarantino school' tries to make its point by bombarding us with ever more blood: Unfortunately, as far as I am concerned, the end result is usually to become fed up and stop watching, just like I recently did with 'Kill Bill'.And yet, 'Sin City' was different: Although ultra-violent (a typical scene for example shows Mickey Rourke chainsawing somebody's hands and feet and then giving the rest of the body to a wolf which rips it off!), it still manages to convince us that this raw violence is a vital part of the nature of this generally eccentric film, and not an addition put in just to catch our attention. 'Sin City' is the adaptation of a violent comic on screen, and as such, violence comes naturally in the flow of the movie.A movie which is weird, so to say: As I said, it is an adaptation of a comic (which I haven't read, by the way) on-screen, and as such, it is something between a comic and a film, or both. With its black-and-white footage, containing colorful objects in several instances (red blood, green eyes, yellow person, etc.) thus making them much more distinct and powerful, 'Sin City' is a different experience to watch. Diefferent and great, thanks to Miller's and Rodriguez's great work! Although it features many A-class names, such as Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, and others, acting is of lesser importance here: We are not interested so much in the characters and their performances, but in the overall magic atmosphere. This does not mean that the 'Sin City' actors are doing their job well: On the contrary, their performances are fine. It is simply that the focus is elsewhere...'Sin City' is film that should not be watched with a full stomach, as it will take you for a tough ride. And yet, do not miss this ride! 9/10.",9,1,2,30 July 2006
The Godfather," One of the Greatest Films of All Time
","I believe that there is little that need to be said about the 'Godfather'. A true masterpiece, whose characters has become legendary (who has not heard about Don Corleone), has been followed by an equally great sequel (not counting Godfather III which is a good movie but definitely belongs to a lower league than I and II), and has inspired and paved the road for other legendary mafia films ('Goodfellas', 'Once Upon A Time in America').With a large bunch of all-time classic actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton, the performances given in Godfather provide the definition of top quality cinema. In short, 'Godfather' is one of the films that everybody should watch at some point of his/her life. 10/10.",10,1,4,29 August 2004
