The Hangover," Very funny movie, but not sure if it lives up to the hype
","This was a very funny movie. I went in with high expectations after all my friends who saw it this last weekend talked about how it was 'one of the funniest movies they have ever seen'. I had seen the trailers and had wanted to see the movie, but now I was stoked to see it. My girlfriend and I went to see it because she had also heard it was a great movie. This movie provided tons of laughs for the both of us. I would definitely say this is a comedy you can take your girlfriend to, and if she has any sense of humor, will enjoy herself immensely. The only bad thing about the movie was that a lot of the funny scenes were shown in the trailer. I wish I had never seen the movie trailers. There were also a few scenes that I was saying to myself 'I cant believe they are showing this in a movie', but I left unoffended. Overall, a funny movie worth seeing. Guys will love this movie, and so will their girlfriends. 9/10.",9,1,3,10 June 2009
Pineapple Express," Not close to recent Seth Rogen movies
","If you are expecting another Superbad or Knocked up when going to see this movie, think again. Pineapple Express is a different sort of comedy. It has added the action, blood, and gore to this movie which is funny at times, but gets old when about a half hour of the movie is this 'action'. The funniest part of the whole movie I thought was when the three of them are just sitting at the table in the diner. Pure comedy, no action. Movie was okay but I was disappointed because I set a high standard for Seth Rogen movies. I would have also liked to have seen some of the characters from other movies Rogen was in play bigger roles. The Chinese doctor from Knocked Up is just an annoying gunmen for the Chinese drug mob. Rogen's fellow cop in Superbad was only in the movie for about five minutes, which was a funny five minutes let me add.",4,14,26,20 August 2008
