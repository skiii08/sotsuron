It," A Solid Horror Film Devalued by Jump Scares
","It is a solid piece of horror fiction that does justice to its source as well as its 1990 counterpart. As in many Stephen King stories, the location of small town New England provides a perfect setting for what is an atmospheric and engaging horror film. The characters match the settings and the actors do a good job blending with the aesthetic of their surroundings as well as providing charm and charisma. The plot was engaging and the much anticipated Pennywise played by Bill Skaarsgard is a compelling antagonist, however the one way in which the film fell short was its cheap over use of jump scares. Throughout the film jump scares are scattered, starting off startling but by the end just annoying. Rather than building constant tension and stakes through the story, the constant jack in the box nature of Pennywise's appearances create a detachment in the otherwise smooth flow of the film.",7,2,5,14 September 2017
Baby Driver," Solid and enjoyable action fare from Edgar Wright
","A wonderful summer action comedy by Edgar Wright. While it may seem a relatively shallow film, Baby Driver is an exciting film whose use of music creates fast paced and impressively choreographed car chases. The characters are compelling and well acted by the cast with Ansel Elgort anchoring the film as the eponymous Baby.",8,6,12,17 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A spiritual continuation of the star wars saga
","If George Lucas read a book by Joseph campbell, Rian Johnson read it twice. The Last Jedi picks up where the last film left off and solidifies what is going to be the tone and structure of the new trilogy. Homage is a strong word but the Last Jedi continues to use the foundation of previous trilogies, but where Force Awakens used the original trilogy to get off the ground, Last Jedi uses it to elevate the story and themes. This was the most thematically heavy of the Star Wars movies, spirituality, theology and repetition build into a story that resembles archetypical mythology and legend. George Lucas said of Star Wars that it is an epic poem and each verse rhymes, this is true of the last Jedi. Each callback has payoff and does something to enhance the story. If I were to have one critique it would be of the pacing. Between some of the best action sequences in the Star Wars saga the parts in between can suffer from a lack of momentum. Through and through, this is the next generation of Star Wars, if you disliked Force Awakens, you will probably not enjoy this movie, but based on this I am anticipating great things as the franchise continues.",8,4,17,15 December 2017
Black Panther," Best of Marvel, A Balance of Action and Statement
","Black panther is a good blockbuster pushed to greatness by its importance as a cultural milestone. As far as the recent movies from marvel go, Black Panther is a stand out in how it goes beyond entertainment to dig deeper than most superhero blockbusters. The political statements of a film based in African culture and heritage are main themes and are addressed but manage not to be heavy handed. It can't be ignored, the cultural importance of a movie rooted so deeply in African American culture with important figures of that community coming from all different mediums to create this movie. While its easy for the film to become wrapped up in the statements that it makes within the context of our society, it also functions as one of the better products of marvels fail proof formula. As all marvel films, the characters are a strength, each is compelling and the villains are especially well done, a feat that marvel has struggled with in the past. The action sequences are creative and through all of the quips and jokes there are some genuine heartfelt moments. In the end Black Panther is an enjoyable movie elevated by what it means in a broader context.",8,4,19,18 February 2018
