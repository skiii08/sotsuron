Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the 10 best adventure films of all time
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is a film that elevates the standard for action -adventure films. Spielberg excels at bringing us to the edge of our seat while making us laugh at the same time. The stunts are so unbelievable and surreal, they seem animated. Throw in some strong character development and you have a recipe for success. The movie envelops itself in exotic, mystical settings, and if you're like most people and have phobias about snakes and spiders then hang on for the ride of your life. Our hero does pause for a romantic interlude but instead of slowing down the pace it actually adds another dimension to the story by giving Indiana Jones a softer more human side. Bravo for a winning genre that will hopefully continue to please moviegoers for some time to come.",10,0,1,14 March 2005
