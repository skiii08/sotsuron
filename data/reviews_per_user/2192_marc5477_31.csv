The Sound of Music," What an awful movie... how do people watch this sellout trash?
","This movie has nothing going for it. Even Andrews cant save it. The plot is ridiculous, the characters are unlikable, and the music is generic and tedious. This is no Mary Poppins or My Fair Lady. It is a cheap and lazy rip off written over a couple of bathroom breaks for the sake of capitalizing on musicals that were popularized by the former mentioned titles which came out a year prior.On top of the benign writing and non-existent character development, some scenes were a laugh. The love interest between the eldest daughter and the 17 year old twit made my stomach turn, never mind the father who is basically a partially retarded copy of Mr. Banks from Mary Poppins. There is nothing original in this film. Its not even historically accurate, not that this was a consideration in my review. But how this came to become so popular is a travesty. The music was especially bad, and mind numbing when listened to. I'd rather listen to modern rap than the soundtrack to this movie.",1,14,43,28 January 2016
Iron Man 3," I saw it yesterday and already forgot what it was about...
","Maybe I was just not in the mood for a brainless movie, or maybe the movie was significantly less interesting than average movies, but I just didn't like it. It had no substance. No interesting characters. No interesting plot. It was just scene 1, scene 2, scene 3 etc etc without anything really make me care or even want to know what will happen next. It was... boring. Now honestly, despite being a big comic fan, I never particularly cared for Iron Man as a character. I found him uninspired and prototypical. He wasn't bad, but he was always boring in comics, and now in movie. I definitely enjoyed the 1st Iron Man more than the 3rd but the 2nd and 3rd were snore fests and all the tech and actions didn't help one bit which is a double whammy because I am also a huge sci-fi fan on top of loving comics but I just couldn't enjoy this movie. Again I cant put my finger on it, but something was just off. It was not fun.",2,17,33,19 May 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Not Star Trek, Not Bad, but so cheesy it felt like a bad soap opera.
","Okay so I love Star Trek but for the sake of this review lets forget about that because this movie (and the last) is not Star Trek. The plot holes are horridly visible and science has been pretty much thrown out the window. These are no sci-fi movies, they are pure fantasy with spaceships. You might as well have magic and pointy eared elves...er wait...Anyway, as a stand alone movie it was OK. Lots of action, none of it believable even in its own context, and some horrendous dialog which made me want to kill both Kirk and Spock as painfully as imaginably possible. Don't get me wrong, the acting was fine, but the story was just poorly executed. I really didn't care about the character (good or evil) nor the plot. I saw Iron Man just a night ago and felt the same about that movie. They are both just hollow soulless movies with action thrown in and some big pretty girls here and there. I liked this a little more than Iron Man but not by much. I still didn't care what happens in the end nor did I care to see it. If the movie were to stop 10 minutes before the end I wouldn't have cared to watch it later and see the ending... I suppose that says everything. Rent it.",5,2,6,19 May 2013
Orphan," Good acting, attrocious writing
","Nothing in this horror thriller is even remotely believable. It takes itself very seriously and expects you to believe some of the situations that take place but bottom line is that Hellraiser and Transformers are more believable than this thing. Lets see, where to start.You're at the hospital, and a 100lb woman gets hysterical. She is already restrained by 2 people, so what do you do? Call the cops? nope. Inject her with tranq lol. Do you have any idea how irresponsible that it? The hospital would get sued not to mention how medically irresponsible it is to shoot something into someone you dont know the history of. This could not even happen in a 3rd world hospital. But wait we are not done.The father is the granddaddy of all cliches. Completely oblivious to to his surroundings and does everything in his power to obstruct any reasonable conversation or logical thought. For instance, a child falls off a slide and breaks her ankle, then a nun goes missing, then the car rolls down a street with his daughter in it, then there is a fire in a treehouse outside in the middle of a snowy winter, then his son falls out of the treehouse and goes into coma, then the son almost dies after being told he was stable, then his wife tell him that their adopted child papers are not right and still he does not have even a single shred of doubt that it was all coincidence. I mean... I know you needed a whipping dog to make the story work, but come on. I think magic and unicorns are more believable than this and I didnt even cover everything.Otherwise, the acting was actually excellent especially the young lady playing Esther (Fuhrman) and the other two kids. The mom and dad were ok but very cliche and thus not particularly memorable outside the bad writing mentioned above. This could have been much better with a better story.",4,2,5,19 September 2018
Aquaman," So poorly written...
","Unbelievably cheesy and not in a smart or funny way. Literally plays out like a 80s cartoon and though they have their charm, my limit is about 20 minutes before my patience runs out and thats what happened here. Im not a kid any more and even when I was a kid, i really didnt like how bad the writing was but I put with it due to lack of options.So what is the problem with Aquaman? Forced emotional nonsense that did not convince. Silly story revolving around pollution politics against a group that is supposed to be extremely advanced, yet they cant figure out how to contain, organize, and recycle trash.... No sign of intelligence in any character, they are all emotionally fueled doorknobs. The quests in the movie include laughable stuff you find in C-grade video games like 'retrieve the magic weapon' and 'decode daddies message.' Then to add to the pain, a rap version of Toto's Africa... nauseating stuff.On top of the writing and story, there are a lot of plot holes. The plot itself is silly beyond belief. These 'bad guys' want to take revenge on the surface of earth in a universe that includes the likes of Superman and Wonder Women... Seriously? They cant even figure out trash recycling.Its a kids movie. Might be ok for high schoolers and below but thats about it. For everyone else, its a chore to watch.",2,2,4,31 January 2019
Deadpool 2," Just when you though the Marvel movies couldnt get worse...
","This is easily the worst Marvel mutant movie made to date. Not funny in any way unless you're about 10 years old. The story is asinine and writing was something out of a high school production. Also, the depiction of the comic characters is one of the worst in any movie so far. I am a big fan of Domino and Cable but I hated everything about them in this movie. They are nothing like the books I read back in the 90s and 2000s. Cable was completely ruined and Domino is now a ditsy clown. They couldn't have selected a worse actor for the character for Nathan. He was so out of place with the written character that you might as well had given the roll to Ben Stiller. That actor needs to be replaced immediately.",1,366,910,19 May 2018
Ready Player One," An ok trip down memory lane, but nothing new
","Yet another video game nostalgia movie. This time we have a virtual world and the world is a ugly place so everyone plays. Nothing new, its been done before in movies, anime, and books. A group of kids hunt for an easter egg inside of the most popular game on the planet (or so it seems). They have to outsmart, and outwit adults and big corporations as they search for the magic egg that gives the finder control and major ownership of the game. We have kiddie romance, murder, and all sort of stuff along the way but that is about it. I laughed exactly once during the Terminator 2 scene but honestly, the movie was not funny and the CGI action was not particularly impressive if you are a gamer already. The nostalgia hooks have been beaten to death already so no points there either.Not a bad movie, its watchable but certainly its no masterpiece nor is it memorable. Give it a go, but dont expect much.",6,1,4,20 June 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Yet another insult to highly intelligent people
","I get it, smart people scare normal people because they cannot understand how they got so smart. But to blatantly say that we are evil and jealous of normal intellects who are rich or powerful is nonsense and just proves that normal people really dont understand us at all. Rich and powerful are not things that turn us into evil beings... we are not you.Unfortunately, the entire movie revolved around this idea. Parker (like Stark) is a twit. The idea that people like them could invent anything is beyond asinine (same for Mysterio who cant think himself out of a paper bag). In the end, it was as you expect. The normal twit wins because they can out think a smart person when it counts and the smart guys are filth and make so many bad choices that its wonder that their autonomous system can even regulate their breathing.Technically, this movie is your average comic book movie fare. Good CGI, acting is ok, story and dialog are about high school level. Comedy is on the bad side. There were some funny moments but they were far and few between. The over the top teachers were not funny at all.Spiderman actually looks good for once in his battle at the end. Showing off some of what makes him neat in the comics. I like the depiction of MJ better than most of the books. I still dont like Fury. Never liked Stark so I dont get Peters fascination either which does not exist in the books. Its an action flick and aside from the action, the movie was shallow. Not the worse movie, but just boring.",4,1,1,15 September 2019
Doctor Strange," Complete horse poop
","Sorry but I just don't see it. The only thing going for this movie is special effects and that is all. You might as well call this Transformers XII or whatever number they are on. The story was asinine and pretty much nullifies the need for any other heroes and the characters themselves were total garbage. Strange is un-redeemable. He is filth and not smart in any way. Again, Hollywood does not seem to be able to portray what smart people are really like. They think that we are all air heads. We might be arrogant and many think we might seem condescending to some but we are usually right and we almost never as closed minded as this clown. In fact, by definition of being smart, we better understand just how little we know. We don't need to be reminded of this and we are fully aware of it. This portrayal of smart scientist in this movie is insulting.Next, the antagonist was also a total flipping retard. The plot is that he wants to live forever by killing everyone and sacrificing the earth to something that does not live under the rule of time... well if the thing is outside of time, why the hell does it seem to exist at a specific point? Why does it not exist across multiple points as it should and why would a time loop isolate it to one form? Why did it not just leave Strange alone and continue what it was doing prior? It didn't actually need to kill him but it was apparently so dumb that it couldn't think of any other solution to escape the trap.I don't know. It was one of the worst Marvel movies I have seen. Certainly worse than Wolverine and old Hulk movies.",2,4,10,12 February 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Lowers the bar yet again
","They keep double and tripling down on destroying Star Wars lore and well... this one is the worst of the last 3. This movie devolved into a 80s cartoon. Everything is unbelievable and random as if everyone has just given up on the franchise. These movies are trash. If they didnt have the Star Wars title in them they would have all lost millions.Here is the bottom line:World Wide Box Office Totals (gross not net profit)
------------------------------------
Ep6 - $1,150,197,303 (inflation adjusted from 2005)
Ep7 - $2,068,223,624
Ep8 - $1,332,539,889
Ep9 - $1,074,035,619 (2019)That speaks louder than words. Economy was up at every iteration as you go down the list. Population kept growing. Inflation was up as were ticket prices. Yet, less people went to see the movies. And yes that is correct, the latest movie made less than Ep3 and how bad were those prequels? Well compared to the last 3 movies, I suppose the prequels were masterpieces.If Disney has any decency at all, they will let Star Wars go. I am not sure to who, but as long as its not Awe Bol or anyone affiliated with Terintino, Abrams, or Rian I am willing to give them a shot and pay for a ticket (didnt pay for any of the Disney iterations nor ep2 or ep3).",1,4,7,15 March 2020
Man of Steel," I loved it. By far my favorite superhero movie of all time.
","Here is the thing. I am a huge comic book buff since middle school. I have more comics than probably every reviewer claiming to have a read a superman book in this review thread. With the lone exception to the Doomsday arc, Superman comics suck the big one. They are most boring, monotonous, nonsensical, stupid books ever to grace such popular icon in fiction history. They have no real world logic. Explanations are retarded and lazy. And the stories are simply not interesting and the romance angles are so bad that its more of a comedy than romance.Now don't get me wrong, there are some good stories that involve Superman but the main line of books are horrible. This is why they were worthless even during the comic book peak in the 90s. No one cared about them.Now all that said, I find it insane to read reviews here claiming that the movie was bad because it didn't follow the books, which, oh by the way, rewrote his past more times than I can remember. So why is it OK to do in the comics but when done in a movie its sacrilege? The answer is that the reviewers have some sort of agenda against video. To that I say, grow up. I have more books than any of you and even I don't stoop to such stupidity. I especially love the folks who didn't actually listen during the movie try to nitpick many points using logic but do so using fallacious statements and plain wrong logic.Now about the movie. I love believable depictions of superhero characters. I always have and always will. I love comedy depictions as well but what I hate, no what makes me puke, are movies that are inconsistent. One second they are serious and the next it is slapstick non-sense. This is what I did not like about the old movies. On one side you have a serious Superman and on the other you have some goof ball with the IQ of a donut as his enemy. Lex was horribly portrayed in the old movies as were the other kryptonians. This is the 1st superman movie that tried to make sense of the world and maintain believability throughout with good albeit not perfect reasons (that many people criticized laughable incorrectly). After all, this is still a fantasy so how believable can one make it? But at least some reasons made sense, for instance, why Superman is weak to krytonite. They actually made sense out of a big story element that all the Superman books in history could not. Of course some stuff was still iffy like why his parents chose to not leave Krypton. Of course, no Superman book has made sense of that to date anyway. They tried to convince us that they couldn't leave any more than worker ants in a hive. The idea is that they didn't have much free will and had to die with the planet, yet they broke their programming to modify Kal-El and eject him from the planet. At least they tried. Its more than I can say about the retarded comic book depictions.Overall, I thought the portrayal of Zod was very good. He was much more menacing than in the books or in older movies. He was really a threat and one could actually understand why. There have been many times in life when I looked at other humans and though the life was wasted on them. From the perspective of a superhuman, humans can look extremely petty and pure evil. Of course, the hole in the plot is that this is also true for kryptonians as there were some who were criminals. Thus, Zod should know that absolute logic makes no sense unless you buy unto the idea that kryptonians are genetically programmed in such a way that they are predisposed to think a certain way... this is soft science and I never bought it but again, at least they tried. Still better than any comic explanation to date.Overall I loved it. Its easily a 9/10 with plenty of action and lore to keep me interested all the way through.",9,3,10,6 August 2014
Divergent," Retarded science, situations and ending ruin the movie
","Here are the pivotal problems from my memory after barely watching it once (while playing on my phone): (warning some of these are spoilers)1) When Tris gets the flag it was because the guard was not guarding the only grate leading up to that position. Not science but retarded none the less. Further how the hell did that guard use all her bullets when Tris was the 1st person up the tower? Whatever.2) Three men couldn't push a 100lb girl over a ledge. Whatever. When she is rescued by her boytoy, he didn't bother removing their masks to see who they are when he had all day to do it while they were down.3) Brains can be wiped and reprogrammed with chemicals. No that's not how brain physiology works. If you wipe completely then you would be a vegetable because the only way to do so is to destroy pathways that form action, intent and memory. You cannot wipe a mind by chemical means without wiping it entirely. It might be doable with nano machines but this particular future does not even have guided weapons. Nano tech is beyond their ability. Hell their scientists are actually emotional pansy politicians. Retarded.4) Apparently 'divergence' is the only way one can be a threat to society. Yea right. Apparently with all the collective knowledge of the science group, this is the conclusion they came up. They actually believe that the most deviant of society are the ones with the greatest intelligence and potential not those with low self esteem, low intelligence, and shallow personalities. But that is too much for them to figure out I guess. Some scientists they are... and you expect them to have nanotech? Its like expect al kaida to invent the 1st sentient AI lol.5) The ending was not as dramatic as the movie made it out to be. Finding a vial on the floor with an applicator is not quick thinking, its obvious and embarrassing (that she and her boy toy didn't figure it out sooner).6) The romance innuendo was unbelievable. Its worse than a Mexican soap. There was no reason whatsoever for that guy to be so overwhelmingly interested in her and willing to risk everything for her. Its like a bad high school drama.7) Actions scenes were worse than comedy action scenes. Bullets seem to go around the main character like a cartoon. Also no one seems to remember how to shoot when engages against her. Also she miraculously becomes an expert shot after being the worst shot during training. They should have just given her throwing knives and have her fly across roof tops like kung fu movies.Retarded movie for low IQ teens.",1,2,3,27 July 2014
Avengers: Endgame," Time travel is when you run out of ideas or cant write worth a darn
","As the title says. You know you have reached a dead end when you introduce time travel to resolve things. It works fine in shows that focus on it like Quantum Leap or Sliders but its usually a sign that you cant write worth a darn if you bring it into something else. That and alternate universes etc. They have been done to death and back and are just a plot device to overcome bad writing.So anyway, I still gave this a 5 because the CGI and fight scenes were fun. Unfortunately, that is about all there is to say about this movie. It was pretty hollow. The only source of comedy came with the introduction of smart hulk who was just funny conceptually more than anything else. Otherwise, I actually thought that this movie made all the other movies worse because... time travel...Its a shallow movie. Not worthy of its rating in the least.",5,14,19,16 August 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," I actually stayed awake... and it wasn't bad.
","This movie was a pleasant surprise. I went in expecting to fall asleep as my fiancé (A big Disney fan) enjoyed her movie, but it really was better than expected. I think the reason I liked it was because it did not take itself very seriously like other pretentious movies nor was the plot inappropriate for the target audience (like falling in love). It was a simple story about immature characters learning a little more about what life is really like and how unfair it can be then growing up a little by the end. I think this would be a great movie for young kids and for us... older kids, we can always enjoy remembering our childhood and how we learned those very same lessons in a less stressful and more forgiving way (movie rather than real life). There was no over the top bloody killing scenes or silly overdrawn dramatic dialog nor artsy fartsy elements, just a story about a guy who was bored and wanted to make friends only to find that that the best friend was the one who understood him best, not the ones he tried to impress. It also teaches that you don't have to be famous and win medals to be important and that hard work and cooperation is required to make the world go round. All good lessons for kids. Maybe I am a sap but since stories cant surprise me anymore, I would rather there be a good lesson rather than nothing at all like most movies today.",9,0,0,20 May 2013
City of God," Good movie, but far from original and has been done many times in the past
","Its a fictional story about a kid who wants to become a photographer and grew up in the slums of Brazil. The story is told like a documentary with the main character playing narrator and talking about his experience in the slums known as the 'City of God.' We follow the lives of himself as well as friends and adversaries from childhood to adulthood. The movie does a good job of conveying how hopeless life can be in certain parts of the world and that sometimes there are no options for those living in such conditions (unless they get extremely lucky like the main character). In many ways its no different than the myriad of gangster life style movies made here in the USA for the last 30 years. I think we had a movie like this every year back in the 90s. Boyz in the Hood comes to mind, as well as Menace to Society. Still, it is a good movie though a bit overrated. Certainly it does not belong in the top 50 of all time as many people place it. I think the movie seems better to English speakers precisely because it is not in English. Its the same thing that happens when I watch Japanese animation. The characters seem more interesting when you cannot gauge their personality through voice and have to fill in the information from imagination. The minute you hear a dubbed version of the same show, the entire show is usually ruined. This is probably what is happening here. Another issue is that the movie seemed to drag on a bit too long. The violence also got stale by the end since the movie kept making the same points over and over. Definitely give it a look and if you like it, look up all the great 90s mafia/hood life movies because you will probably like those as well.",7,0,3,12 March 2017
Django Unchained," No... just no
","The movie started with some potential. I like the bounty hunter but after the initial appearance the movie just repeated itself over and over and over and over. It was the same predictable scene in a different place and with different characters. Further as the movie progressed, the action became more absurd but because the movie was not funny or entertaining, it just became a drag. Midway through the film I just wanted both bounty hunters, all the slaves, and all the slavers to die in an brief atomic blast so I can just leave the theater. Unfortunately I was there with 2 friends and I really didn't want to ruin their night though I discovered that they hated the movie too... we should have all asked for our money back.These types of movies are just garbage. All artistic, without any substance or any reason to be made into a movie but hey, its the land of the free so to all their own. Next time just do us a favor and put a huge warning on the poster with the words 'Artsy Farsty' so we all know what we are paying for.",1,32,55,20 May 2013
A Quiet Place," Cheap tugs, cheaper story, otherwise ok
","Lets get the bad out of the way. The way the movie was resolved was nonsense. If that were really a weakness, it would have been discovered near immediately when these creatures were discovered. Also, those things would not stand a chance against any military or police force in any country, no less the USA. They would have been wiped out.The other problem is the cheap way the movie tries to pull you in emotionally. Basically, lets kill a cute kid and then give all the characters some emotional problems from the event. Now using that, lets see them make poor decisions to create tension... Very formulaic and down right cliche.Outside of all that, what you have here is a tame slasher flick with aliens. Nothing new and certainly not any better than others like Alien or The Thing. Its not terrible, but definitely not worth of a 7+ score. At best its a 5 like most generic horror stuff.",5,0,2,13 July 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Poor character development left a hallow shell
","The premise was fine, the special effects were good, and the flash backs were interesting however the film suffered from poor directing. The scenes simply didn't flow well despite being filled with interesting tidbits about Jacks history and the possible consequences of the ending. I think the big problem was character development. In the 1st movie, the characters had a lot of quality scenes whereas in this one they had equal time but the scenes were not great or memorable. For example, in the 1st movie we had that great fight scene between Jack and Will filled with comedy and purpose. In this one, the only scene Henry had that was remotely interesting was at the beginning when tried to locate his dad but the problem is that the scene was simply dumb. He basically committed suicide simply to say hi to dad. It was not reasonable and it certainly did not make me like Henry in any way like I liked Will in the 1st. Elizabeth Swan also had a better story than Carina who was largely a wimpy version of Elizabeth and although she is supposedly smart, she did not come off as such as her only purpose in the entire movie is to point a ship in a direction and that is all. She served no other purpose and her romance with Henry was not convincing. Lastly, and possibly the biggest problem, Jack was not funny... actually, I cant remember a funny scene in this movie which is a huge let down. They tried to crack a few jokes here and there but they were not good. I also felt like Jack played practically no part in the movie aside from making it things harder than they should have been. In fact, this movie did not need Jack Sparrow at all. He didn't have any smart tricks up his sleeves, nor did he contribute much of anything and Salazars hate of Jack felt as empty as Henry and Carina's romance. It simply made no sense.Overall, id say its an average movie. Nothing worth watching more than once, and certainly not worth the price of admission but its better than straight to TV movies and certainly better than movies like the Ninja Turtles debacle or the lousy Transformer movies.",5,3,4,7 September 2017
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Unwatchable
","Almost turned it off about 23 minutes in. The dialog and acting is atrocious never mind the terrible CGI which looks like a late 90s video game. This had all the qualities of a C-grade parody made over a drunken weekend except it isnt a parody and they spend a lot of time and money making it. I am officially adding the director and writers to my $*it list.How bad is it? Oh look a helicopter tail & propeller are moving towards me slowly... I think I will scream for help instead of... you know... moving. Also we can now talk in vacuum of space, the Arabs are actually white dudes in robes, abilities get switched just so Alba can get naked, and half the movie is a wedding comedy, minus the comedy.No redeeming qualities to this. All writers and directors need to be banned from making movies, actors should be quarantined for 10 years to re-evaluate their lives, and the fantastic four comics need to be canceled (they were always terrible anyway).",1,0,5,15 September 2018
Big Hero 6," My 9 year old nephew caught the major plot holes...
","Bad movie overall. I'd say its about average for kids (but a point below average for adults). The entire movie is insanely predictable and the characters are unintelligible beyond belief for something that starts out serious. I think they wanted to pull the viewers heart string but instead it just made me roll my eyes. The robot himself is a funny character and the move started interestingly enough but then it takes a weird turn and becomes a kid super hero movie and became insanely stupid. None of the human characters are interesting in any way and the plot is also asinine. There are no moral lessons to be learned from this movie if you want to show it to your kids aside from being stupid is perfectly fine.Oh, the plot hole my nephew caught is why didn't the kid just make more bots? Because then there would be no movie to make. Im just glad he didn't ask why not just make a 2nd brain controller... that would be way too easy though. Yes... a 9 years old was smarter than this script. That is how dumb the story is.",4,22,79,10 April 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," What the hell was this?
","Wow this is getting hammered by reviews and now I understand why. Given its still in week 1 and most of the early reviews were all paid for and fake, the fact that this is at:57% - Rotten Tomatoes
50% - MetacriticMeans that the real scores are likely closer to 30% and 25% if you take out all the paid for 'pro' and fake user reviews... Are they serious? Didnt they learn from the 1st one that they need to push the story forward instead of making a C grade retelling the old stories? Wow, so glad I didnt pay to watch this.1st of all, the replacement characters remain unlikable because dialog and character building is poor. Attempts at humor are not funny nor charming, and the plot development might as well be written by someone with a high school level intellect. Plot holes abound in what is sadly yet another attempt at a retelling of the same story from the 80s... how you can make more plot holes in a story remake? Well they did. and they threw in a few eye rolls as Rei continues to be a lore destroying super Jedi that has more power than all the previous Jedi combined without even trying and barely any training. The sensitive storm trooper who didnt want to kill can now kill all his brethren with a smile. And oh apparently the rebel are now so dumb that they dont even consider looking around for an exit when they are trapped, that is until the magnificent leader says they should look around and after asking Lea if its ok to look around with him... lol. Luke who is supposedly a master Jedi at this stage in his life, is now the guy who either died due to being out of shape or by a 3rd rate sith dork who lost to a storm trooper in melee combat. But he sure fooled him for a minute to allow a group of worthless idiots to escape... I guess this was his Obiwan moment when he went up against a full powered Darth Vader and had no chance of winning... except in Lukes case it was against a kitten with the IQ of a wet towel. They basically took a dump on all three original movies (and even the prequels if you care about those) as well as all the written lore that came after not to mention common sense. Luke got killed while projecting his hologram... why? To give the rebels time to escape when all they had to do was look around for an exit and shoot themselves out. But they were too dumb to figure that out. It took sacrificing Luke (who didnt actually need to die, he could have pulled out the second they started looking for an exit) and Rei to move a few rocks to do what would have been trivial with the guns and equipment the rebels had with them. And all this happened why? Because they ran out of gas lol.Good bye Star Wars.",1,1022,1430,17 December 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Marvel is fizzling out... boring boring boring movie.
","The title says it all. This installment of marvel heroes must have been written by the Hulk... 1% brain and 99% brawn. Basically, if you saw the trailer, you do not need to see the movie. Its a basic action flick and the plot was clearly just a secondary thing thrown in to show off special effects and animation. I was never a fan of the Averngers or Iron Man but I could tolerate them because I love comics and fiction. The problem with this movie is that the AI is treated as dumb making the plot silly, while the Avengers waste half a movie mopping around because they cant get along. The dialog was OK but you need to be a hardcore fan of each character to not be bored to tears... I am not a huge fan and I really don't care for all the explosions and action unless there is a solid plot.",4,4,11,25 August 2015
A Clockwork Orange," Artsy Fartsy Tale About Free Will Wrapped in Shock Value
","The title pretty much sums up the entire movie. Save yourself the trouble and just skip it and for petes sake, dont sell out just to make yourself look deep.This film is a childish rendition of what it means to be human. The argument is that its better to have choice and make bad choices than to have none. Its not a new idea, and most humans tackle the question by 4th grade when they realize they can think for themselves... well at least, most do. Clearly many dont have the brain power to think that deep, well into adulthood, hence the high scores you see for this film. Somehow, the question of self is profound to them. Truth is they are simply unintelligible themselves.So anyway, this subject has been tackled since the dawn of humankind even in religion itself. Its taught in sunday school and even cavemen probably talked about it. Its not new, not profound, not original and certainly not well told in this film. The claim to fame for this film is just its shock value and people who assume that this was shocking back in the 70s. It wasnt. History lesson. Violence back then was easily 3-4x higher than today. It was far more common and anyone with half a brain knew just how violent the world was by just going outside or by reading the paper. Of course most people didnt hence the surprise when they saw this trashy movie. It was basically like watching porn and let me tell you porn back then was equally graphic. I remember walking around the hotel lobby in Europe as a kid where they had porn magazines out in the open. Subjects like watersports and scat were normal so dont tell me people had not seen worse back in the day and mind many had seen the horrors of WW2 so again, this film was literally nothing in comparison.Anyway, stop making excuses for this film. This movie is the brainchild of an immature mind and there is nothing more to say about it. Everything was childish from message and imagery to execution and dialog. Grow up already. We are no longer 15 years old.",1,3,12,8 March 2019
It Chapter Two," A repeat of the originals
","Chapter 2 stinks. Simply because it was the same as Chapter 1 but with adults. The big distinction is they want you to believe that the adults are just children. Well guess what? I wasn't convinced because they were indeed adults.I was amazed at how unintelligible the characters are. You are adults... you are facing some sort of demon and you get to plan your actions. Wouldn't you think that arming yourself with gear and weapons would be wise? Gee... Also who the heck would be afraid of that clown as an adult? Maybe a few scaredy cats might be but I want to believe that most adults would treat the clown like a threat that needs to be fought. The entire premise of course would fall apart if the characters were not scared which is the flaw from the start. This plot really only works with children or creatures much more frightening than clowny.So anyway, it was a slog to develop the story and a chore to watch if unfold. The story should have been rewritten with some sort of twist or at least more comedy. Overall, not a good film.",3,0,1,30 October 2019
Halloween," Insanely overrated even for its time
","Sorry but all of you artsy fartsy posers who think the original was a horror masterpiece need to go take a cold reality shower. The 1st movie was nothing more than a art cliché. Many site the fact that Michael was mysterious as being profound and scary, well guess what cousins, it was done to death and back in books before the movie was ever conceived and the 1st movie was probably one of the few horror movies in the 80s that I was NOT afraid of. Mind you I was about 5 when I saw it. I didn't even know it was considered horror until I was much older. The imagery was stale, the suspense was yawn inducing that even as a child I couldn't watch it most nights out of boredom (it was being shown several times a week on channel 2 back in the day). Frankly, if you were scared of this, then any thriller of the time would have done the same to you.The bottom line is keeping things 'mysterious' is a cheap cliché in itself and gutless discussion when it comes to movies. It is what a director or writer does when they know that they do not have a good story to tell or when they don't know how to tell a story. No different than a Michael Bay movie today. Don't have a story? Just avoid story and distract the viewer with something else. Some nudity here and there, sex talk, cheesy music (even then it was cheesy, for petes sake some of the best music in history came from that era), and some blood.If I wanted no story, I would visit an art gallery and use my imagination to fill in the blanks. If I wanted more detail and deeper explanations, I will read a book. But when I go to a movie, I expect the writers and directors to have at least enough skill and guts, to try and tell a good story otherwise there is no point in making a 1.5 hour motion picture. Even if the story stinks, at least they try which is more than I can say about John Carpenters Halloween. Sorry but I am no fan.For what its worth, back when I was 5 or 6, some movies did scare me. Poltergeist, The Exorcist, The Brood, and even Alien was scary to me. Jaws, and Piranha also got some adrenaline going. Hell even the original Blob from the 50's scared me more than Halloween.",2,2,8,12 March 2017
The Wolverine," Below average writing on top of an already boring character
","I grew up on comics through the 90s and although Wovie was never a favorite of mine, I did enjoy a few X-Men story archs. Enter this movie... I wouldn't say it deserves a 1 but it was well below average in many ways but most importantly, in its story telling aspects. I really don't care about flashy action or heavy graphic work but I do enjoy a well written story. If it has other good things then great but without a solid story, movie have no reason to exist. This one was poorly written and directed. It simply tried to encompass too many things in too little time. The romance did not work (at all). The action was boring. The story was absolutely idiotic and made no sense... and yet the movie takes itself serious. It should have been made into a comedy. Characters were not interesting and not well developed and the ending was a laugh (not in a good way). (very minor spoiler) I mean seriously... he could have driven into the compound with a Prius and he would avoided all the obstacles unscathed... but no... he had to walk it lol. Whatever.Only watch this if you have nothing better to do and it is free.",4,1,3,9 December 2014
The Croods," Not great but entertaining enough to recommend to parents.
","A good kid movie, but not so good for adults. Again I watched this with my fiancé who loves animated movies and although it had its funny moments, I was bored for most of the movie. The basic moral of the story is to not keep your head in the sand. Traditions are not always good, and education is important else you will become obsolete and it can hurt you in the long run. I found the grandma relationship with the husband to be somewhat funny as was some of the cave dweller behaviors. Aside from that however, I thought the execution was a little bland. If you have kids, this is a good movie though I really wouldn't want my kids to assume that falling in love is how it was portrayed in this movie and others. I really think that animated movies need to stop pushing the idea that liking someone after 2 minutes is somehow 'love.' I see too many people falling into this trap at an adult age and now in my mid 30s I am seeing all those relationships fall apart some in very ugly ways. We really should not encourage this type of behavior... anyway, gripe about absurd love aside, the movie was OK.",5,1,6,20 May 2013
The Matrix," Amazingly good film... though I think it was an accident
","Bottom line is that the Matrix was awesome and still is. The idea was not new, and certainly it had been covered in film in the past, but the ideas of what life was really like outside the Matrix were fresh and the action made the movie thrilling to watch. The chemistry between characters was also excellent and I think that this was one of Laurence Fishburne best performances and certainly Reeves best as well. They fit their roles to the T.That said, I really think that the greatness of the 1st film (of the trilogy) was a sheer accident. A wonderful accident, but an accident none the less. How do I know? Because the sequels straight up stunk and at the time, were considered a huge disappointment, so much so, that sci-fi fans stopped talking about the movies out of sheer frustration with the sequels. If the sequels were not so bad, then the Matrix franchise would easily rival Star Wars today because the first film was that good. It was on the mind of every sci-fi fan for 3 years. We talked about it like it was Star Wars but after the sequel... the buzz was completely gone, and people forgot about the movies. Many kids today have not even heard of this trilogy for that reason.Still, a great movie in its own right. Easily one of my favorites. Just brace yourself for the terrible sequels...",9,0,0,12 March 2017
Life," Not too bad but the science was lacking
","Basically a remake of Alien except that the alien is more like the Blob. Absolutely no new thoughts went into the making of this movie. They did attempt to make it more scientific but they failed badly at that. The glaring problem is that you in reality, you would never try to resuscitate an alien life form even if its just a cell. The reasons are plain as day for anyone with an inkling of biology knowledge. Given it was biological in nature (dna based or similar), if you do revive said organism, it is highly likely that your microbes will destroy it or its microbes will destroy you. The odds of two organisms from two completely separate ecosystems to be compatible on a micro scale are practically zero which is the flaw of almost all alien based movies that have physical interaction. So anyway, the science was borked from the second they found the cell. No scientist over the age of 12 would have done what these morons did. But then you wouldn't have a movie right? Not an action movie at least. Which is where this one was not too bad in the same way that Alien is not bad. But the big difference is the age of each movie. Alien was great in its time, but today, such films are a dime a dozen and boring. Since there was no originality here and even less research, I cant see myself ever wanting to see it again.Watch it once as an action film if you like semi-realistic action. Skip if you are expecting sci-fi. Its not science, just plain fiction.",6,1,4,9 June 2017
Cube," Insanely overrated
","Yet another psychological thriller type movie that takes itself too seriously. This one presents a bunch of folks thrown into a puzzle with traps. The premise is fine, nothing new even for its time, but still fine if the acting/characters were not so bad. Sorry but the characters in this movie were completely unbelievable from the cop and doctor to the losers of society who magically happen to recall their math and grow a backbone. Not to mention that super computer brain savant. All the characters had personalities that were totally unbelievable. Even if we were to assume the cop was lying and was not really a cop, he was clearly lucid and his actions did not support his goal of survival. The doctor is your token extreme bleeding heart retard, which no doctor can be after a few years of work. The two whiny idiots turn out to be a number theory mathematician and the other does a full 180 in personality (yet remains completely mopey) going from passive a-hole to stud willing to stand up against injustice, in a matter of hours.Aside from the character, the premise (again) was actually OK. Its almost like a precursor to later movies like Saw and similar. If it were not for the horrible characters it would have been much better.",2,4,7,12 March 2015
The Cabin in the Woods," Fun movie that makes fun of the horror genre
","Its part horror and part comedy. Some time mid movie it changes tones and shows you what is really going on, making you take a step back and realize how silly monsters can be from a certain perspective. For example, would you be afraid of monsters if they were under your own absolute control? The reason I liked it is because it reminded me a lot of dreams as I grew up. Like most kids, when i was young, I used to get nightmares but at some point (probably by Jr. high) I started realizing when I was dreaming and all of a sudden the scary Pinhead or Freddy became irrelevant within my own dream because I knew I controlled them (and they quickly changed to well endowed women...). This is how this movies advances. Its like a coming of age movie for horror lovers. They give hints about what is going on during the movie but it starts to come together towards the end and it was fun to watch the chaos. Some younger viewers might find some parts scary, but by the end everyone should be cheering for the monsters.<ul><li>Side note -</li></ul>Most of the low reviews here score the movie based on silly things like not getting scared (or gasp... plot holes in a horror flick lol) during the movie. Well, did it ever occur to you people that maybe, you are older now and its not as easy to be surprised or scared in a horror movie? Get used to it. I had a bad habit of sneaking into the kitchen after everyone was asleep and watching horror movies on late night TV. I saw so many, that I am practically immune to horror hijinks like sudden scares, gore, tension or death. Of course, at the time, these movies gave me nightmares but I was only 4th grade (and I loved the adrenaline rush) but now I am 38. No horror movie has scared me since Hellraiser I. So to grade a movie on the fact that it didn't scare me would not be fair. Does one rate a kids movie as bad because they are no longer a kid? I hope not.",8,3,8,31 January 2015
