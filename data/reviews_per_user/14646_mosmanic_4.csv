The Sound of Music," Beware the scorn of the heartless
","As a teenager in the swingin' 60's, this movie was, to myself and every male contemporary, an object of derision, a sickly piece of confection for soppy girls and their mothers who had an unofficial competition running to find who had seen it the most times and consumed the most tissues.I finally came to it many years later in a moment of weakness, watching it alone, gratefully, as it was still suspect for a chap to have moist cheeks in a movie.The borderline between true sweetness and mawkish sentimentality in film is very hard to draw, but repeat viewings confirm that this is not a marginal case. The portrayal of that increasingly-scarce commodity, genuine innocence, is so finely played by the first-class cast that one can only marvel at how well they pull it off. This was a role that could have been made for showcasing the talents of Julie Andrews, and like most peak-of-career performances it is impossible to imagine anyone else in the part.The music of Rodgers and Hammerstein has been condemned for being below the standards of their contemporaries (Gershwins, Berlin, Bernstein et al), and although that is arguable, it is also incontrovertible that the majority of their musical offerings have withstood the test of time for the sheer rightness of time and place of the songs that assist the dramatic flow rather than stopping it in its tracks. And their innate 'hummability' continues to sustain both the amateur and professional musical theatre in countless revivals.  Most modern musicals consistently fail to attract widespread support because while the writing may be more 'clever' in an often self-indulgent way, they lack the memorability of a single simple tune.I have just watched this film again with my daughters, 10 and 7, and while they have been unavoidably exposed to some of the harshness and cynicism of the 90's I was pleased to see that they accepted and enjoyed the film for what it is, an honest, highly agreeable telling of a story in words and music, that speaks of essential goodness amidst both bright and dark moments. This is the never-ending-story which will delight all those of cheerful heart for as long as films are shown.",10,17,37,27 November 1999
American Beauty," Stories from Suburbia
","The most remarkable thing about this movie is its success, considering that is not a particularly remarkable film. Very capably scripted, acted and directed I found it to be compelling viewing that entertains and, up to a point, illuminates in its examination of a regular family in the 'burbs.But the 'great' movies as measured by box office success or critical acclaim are generally characterised by more extreme situations and characters than we find here. So what is it about this piece that has struck a chord with cinemagoers and critics alike?Perhaps it is the very ordinariness of the characters, who would be almost caricature stereotypes of people we recognise if they were not so well drawn? Maybe the rutted tracks of domestic life, love, work and parenthood are too poignantly familiar not to make us squirm inwardly, but with pleasure? Could it be because the main protagonists all manage a form of escape from their lives of quiet desperation - even central character Lester Burnham (superbly played by Kevin Spacey) appears to have cheated death by speaking to us from the grave, no mean feat even by 21st century standards.
Overall, I suspect a major factor in its success is that audiences are finally ready for mainstream releases with simpler, well-told and portrayed stories that help place us. From the beginning, movies have been seen as vehicles to take us out of ourselves by showing us a bigger, more exciting and dangerous world beyond our neighbourhood. It is possible that we are now ready to confront the truth about ourselves closer to home.",Null,0,0,17 February 2000
Being John Malkovich," A singularity
","It is always refreshing to see surreal concepts explored in mainstream cinema, particularly when they include players of the stature of John Malkovich to add a certain gravitas.It is helpful for any actor's career to be involved in the cast of a successful movie, but to be part of the title as well is a chance for immortality that no-one with even a normal quota of humility could resist. And what a fine casting choice is Malkovich, who clearly has fun in this.On some levels, as a movie this bizarrely conceived and executed plot does deliver many supreme moments of humour and other-worldliness, but the suspension of disbelief required to absorb one completely for a full length feature will be a tough ask for many. I certainly found my mind wandering at several points and wondered if I should have smoked something before seeing it to get the full effect.The puppetry scenes are superbly haunting, and it's almost worth seeing the film for these alone.",Null,0,0,17 February 2000
Shrek," A comedy's comedy
","What a remarkable piece of work is Shrek! Stunning fairy tale fantasy conception and animation bring to life a new story that has all of the elements of the old ones (with terrific cameo appearances) plus a few of its own.The scenes, characters and voices almost make us forget that we are not watching flesh and blood, and materialize a world that our dreams sometimes visit. Many comedies are poorly classified as such, since so few deliver more than an occasional titter. But this multi-level effort delivers plenty of sustained laughs for all ages.Mike Myers as the lead voice, the ogre Shrek, affects for some reason a Scottish accent, which left me thinking of him as a slightly larger and somewhat greener Robbie Coltrane - but he builds a believable character nonetheless. Eddie Murphy's Donkey is very mouthy, as one might expect, but still pleases rather than irritates.If you like to laugh and enjoy being taken to another world this is a movie not to miss.",9,1,2,17 June 2001
