The Blair Witch Project," I was pulling for the witch
","I wish I had seen this before all the hype.  It might have been a very different experience, but these characters were so annoying that I was hoping the witch would kill them as soon as possible.  Students from the Berkley Film School have been doing this sort of thing for years.  It is a wonderful lesson about media hype, though.",4,0,2,5 September 1999
The 13th Warrior," At least there are some interesting battle techniques
","A big, stinky film.  I did not expect much from this film, and it could not even deliver that.  The only interesting thing is some new battle techniques.  Stare at yourself in a mirror for two hours--it will be more enjoyable!",3,0,2,5 September 1999
American Beauty," Difficult to describe, but more difficult to forget
","One of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in a decade.  The acting is outstanding, although the filming is somewhat heavy-handed at times. Nonetheless, it is without a doubt a movie see.  It is clearly a movie for adults, though.  Hire a babysitter and go see this movie.",10,0,0,2 October 1999
