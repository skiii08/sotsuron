The Ring," A Classic Horror Movie For Years
",This is a great horror movie. It is very well written with a great cast. This is a edge-of-the-seat horror flick. The color used in the movie makes it seem like the movie is scary. It is Fear.Com meets Poltergeist. All ages will like this movie. The movie is a classic horror movie for years to come.,9,0,0,19 October 2002
