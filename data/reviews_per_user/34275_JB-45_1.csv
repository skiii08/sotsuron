Catch Me If You Can," Best Picture 2002
","The executive producers - Tony Romano and Michelle Shane deserve not only the Oscar for Best Picture but a Congressional Medal Of Honor for bringing a REAL MOTION PICTURE back to the theaters of the world.  That said;  `Catch Me If You Can' has got to be one of the most thoroughly entertaining feature films since, `Moonstruck.'Hats off to Steven Speilberg for absolutely fabulous direction.  Leonardo Dicaprio deserves the Oscar and Golden Globe for an unbelievably great performance as young Frank Abingnale -  Tom Hanks was, as always, truly convincing as FBI agent, Carl Hanratty - Christopher Walken as Dicaprio's father was a truly mesmerizing performance.  I fell in love with Nathalie Byer.  The entire cast, it seems, is on the same page - the chemistry is at once believable and heart wrenching.Jeff Nathanson screenplay is a beauty.  I expect we'll see a lot more from Jeff.From the opening titles to the costumes to the closing shots this movie was refreshingly original and riveting.  Catch Me If You Can, is a throwback to movies of yesteryear that we movie buffs hold dear to our hearts.Thank you very much for making this movie.",10,0,0,29 December 2002
