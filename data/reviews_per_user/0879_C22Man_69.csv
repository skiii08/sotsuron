The Avengers," Succeeds on star power alone
","In a way it felt like most of Marvel's superhero films up until 2012, with the exception of Iron Man, were in part a build-up to an eventual Avengers film. This mainly being down to little details or minor plot points spread throughout the films, so with all this build-up a lot was riding on Avengers Assemble providing what was expected. I'd say that Avengers Assemble succeeds on star power alone. When you've waited for so long to see so many icon heroes all on screen together and when you have such an entertaining cast pulling the strings it's hard not to get carried away with enjoyment. It certainly has its problems, but as far as sheer entertainment is concerned it prospers.Story: Norse God Loki returns to Earth and steals a tesseract from Shield, which he plans to use to open a portal and bring an alien army to take over the world. Head of Shield Nick Fury initiates a plan to form a superhero team made up of those he's previously contacted and they become the only hope in stopping the invasion. As far as the plot is concerned it is equally absurd and predictable, there's no big twists and a lot of it does stick to some already well-worn clichés. With that said it is a blast to see all the heroes together at last, there squabbles are frequently very funny and seeing them fighting side by side always is exciting.Heroes: The film manages to balance out all the big personalities rather well, yet there are two standouts. Robert Downey Jr. is once again a magnetic and hilarious screen presence, offering many brilliant lines and that well placed sardonic attitude. Mark Ruffalo is simply fantastic as an awkward and edgy Bruce Banner, balancing out all aspects of the character excellently and as the Hulk he manages to get some unexpected laughs. Though both underused, Chris Evans is solid as the stern Captain America and Chris Hemsworth gets enough to do as a slightly more conflicted Thor.Villains: Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki and brings more energy to the role than previously. Loki certainly seems more weary and ruthless than before which works well in making him seem like a major threat, while Hiddleston manages to makes the character even more volatile and his delivery makes each line imposing.Support: Black Widow and Hawkeye act more as back-up to the team, with both being decent enough. Scarlett Johansson looks fantastic in the part and convinces as an all action heroine, but she struggles with some of the weightier dialogue. Jeremy Renner is simply okay as expert archer Hawkeye and he does look the part, but he is given little development and comes off as a bit boring. Samuel L. Jackson is great as usual with more to do this time around as Fury, always believable as a commanding presence and giving the dialogue a spark.Action: The action sequences are all very entertaining in a larger than life kind of way. The Avengers physically fight amongst themselves with the fights between the Hulk and Thor being as well as the Hulk and Iron Man being a lot of fun. The large scale fight on the aircraft carrier is exciting as well as varied and it's nice to see all the Avengers in battle. The climax is as extravagant as you would expect with lots of immense action set pieces and it is thrilling to see all the characters work together, though it definitely drags on a little too much and at times feels like action overload.Music: Alan Silvestri provides an effective and suitably upbeat score. The main theme itself is simply superb in managing to create a sense of importance and excitement. Elsewhere Silvestri gives the action scenes a pounding backdrop and crafts some good melodies.Production: On a certain level Joss Whedon does a successful job given the amount of work he had to do fitting in all the characters and making it work. He knows how to keep the action gripping and when to simply give the actors some room to breathe, while the visuals are injected with enough style and energy to make it work. On the other hand I don't think the dialogue is that great unless its Downey Jr. saying it or it's used for comedic purposes. Most of the important lines feel forced, simplified or just clichéd which is credit to the actors for making it plausible. I think that most of the problems lie with the story, in that it's too straight-forward as to what's going to happen and how thing will pan out. Of course this lets the characters drive the plot a bit more, yet many of them just aren't given sufficient things to do. There is definitely an over-reliance on CGI here as well. Though you'd expect that given the massive action scenes and most of it looks good, it does take you out of the film and that is very apparent during the climax. Conclusion: On a purely entertainment based scale Avengers Assemble succeeds thanks to sheer excitement, big thrills and funny interactions between our heroes. The lighter tone works greatly in the films favour, while we also have plenty of cool fight scenes, an enjoyable villain and good performances, especially those of Downey Jr. and Ruffalo. However once you start thinking about the plot it's the predictability that harms the film and I'd have enjoyed more risks even if they weren't fully realised, whilst there is too much action on the whole. So at a surface level Avengers Assemble is easy to enjoy and have fun watching, just don't think about it for too long.",5,0,2,23 November 2015
Vertigo," Just Might be Hitchcock's Best
","Vertigo might very well be Hitchcock's magnum opus. The film that tops a list of so many greats. His most personal and haunting piece. It stands out in his filmography because of that. It demands repeated viewings. It has to be questioned and reflected upon. It is Hitchcock's most thought-provoking and complex film in that regard, one that stays with you long after it is over. I'm delighted that after being dismissed when it was first released that the film is now rightfully considered one of the greatest of its kind.It revolves around Scottie, a former detective crippled by acrophobia, lured out of early retirement to help an old friend named Gavin Elster. Elster asks Scottie to follow his wife Madeleine, whose strange behaviour he believes is the result of being possessed. To say much more about the plot line would ruin some amazing twists that have to be discovered with fresh eyes. It truly one of the most well thought- out and detailed narratives of all time. One that cannot be second guessed and leads to situations that are impossible to see coming. This is where the repeated viewings come in too. Seeing the film for a second time opens up entirely new perspectives. Something that might not have appeared fully realised before now makes perfect sense. It gives the film immense replay value. The film moves slowly in exactly the right way, building everything up with delicacy and secrecy instead of rushing to the payoff. It relies on atmosphere more than any other Hitchcock film. The almost dreamlike quality conveyed by the camera-work. Our sense of uncertainly increasing along with Scottie's, as he begins to feel some kind of connection to the woman he's following. The initial payoff is put together so well that everything falls into position perfectly. The first two thirds of the film unravel beautifully because of this and the mystery remains totally gripping. We are as intrigued by the mystery as our main character. We are kept in the dark during these scenes and discover information as he does (a technique Hitchcock used frequently). Both James Stewart and Kim Novak deserve massive acclaim for their intricate and detailed performances. Stewart plays against his usual role as the charming everyman, making Scottie gentle but increasing edgy and cautious. A man troubled by his ailment and past failures. Stewart portrays the emotional turmoil beneath the character with such subtlety that we can't help but feel for him. Novak is his equal. Her uneasy acting style fitting such an uneasy character. She's an actress that can convey so much using just her eyes and that is always an impressive feat. Novak is hauntingly beautiful, a crucial detail given with have to believe that Scottie grows to obsess over her. Barbara Bel Geddes deserves credit too for bringing some needed levity as Scottie's friend Midge. The third act is where the film really hits home for me and reaches its pinnacle. Without spoiling anything, the way in which everything comes full circle is done masterfully. It is also here where the film delivers on some really powerful themes such as loss, guilt and obsession. All of these are handled with grace and intelligence, joined to the struggles of our main characters. The emotional connection to the story and empathy we feel for the characters exceeds any expectation, making the films twists and turns all the more impactful. This is a very moving film, something that we very rarely associate with Hitchcock. Yet this is undoubtedly his darkest and most psychological film, deliberately devoid of the wit that usually runs through his work. It delves deep into the psyche of Scottie and all the twisted thoughts and feelings that come with it. Another stand-out is the score. Bernard Herrmann's score is simply magnificent, easily one of the greatest of all time. It is both elegant and eerie, invoking both unease and uncertainty, tying itself to the film masterfully. It makes every scene seem grander or chilling depending on what it calls for. It does everything you could want it to and more. Adding to that is Hitchcock genius camera-work. Every camera movement feels as if it was done for a reason. It helps us feels the uncertainty with Stewart as he sneaks through San Francisco, putting the characters fears into a visual sense. It frequently swirls stunningly in time with the music. It lights the characters to represent their true feelings. The direction is some of the most accomplished you will see. Backing this up are the brilliant title sequence by Saul Bass and the truly unsettling dream sequence, both being great touches that add to the films allure.Vertigo succeeds because it is a film that stays with you. Not just for its plot, acting, visuals and music, but for how it evolves each time you see it. All the pieces of the puzzle are being put into place and you won't be able to connect all of them the first time you see it. Once you do, you realise just how superbly constructed the film is. How this ghostly mystery is simply one piece that leads to something even more affecting. It is undoubtedly one of Hitchcock's best, whether or not it is first on that list simply depends on personal preference. It is a haunting, elegant, frequently surprising and almost dreamlike piece. Its power continues to grow over time.",10,2,4,13 July 2016
Changeling," Engrossing
","Clint Eastwood is a great example of an actor who made a smooth transition into directing. His films are always fluid and visually gripping, direct and deceptively simple, told with a straight face whilst retaining emotional weight. Though some of his directorial work doesn't quite achieve what it set out to, it is it is nearly always gripping on some level and interesting to watch. Whenever he delivers on a script that that allows him to use all of his expertise then he usually provides something engrossing. Never is this clearer than with Changeling, based on the true story of the disappearance of Christine Collins' son and the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders. Here you have a period piece that is tailor made to Eastwood's understanding of human struggle and involving story- telling. The relatively straight-forward story is set in 1928 and mainly details Collins' struggle against the LAPD after her son Walter disappears. The boy they return to her 5 months later isn't hers. Her protests fall on deaf ears as the police insist that she's just in shock and that she should give the boy a trial run. The film continues to build tension and unease brilliantly until Collins is sectioned, which leaves a crusading Reverend and a detective on a case as her only hope. Eastwood had shown previously that he could handle both mystery (Mystic River) and drama (Million Dollar Baby), so a story featuring plenty of both his right up his street and it certainly shows. He handles this story with delicacy and emotion, developing characters and their feelings without letting the story itself become unfocused. The deeper we get into Christine's plight, the more we want to know the truth.The further the film progresses, the more impressive Angelina Jolie's performance is. I was sceptical that should could carry such a film on her shoulders, but she brings everything needed to the role. What she does that is most striking is give us a woman who appears vulnerable on the surface yet contains an inner strength that cannot be broken. I believed every act of defiance and cry of anguish, as much as I believed every tear and melancholic expression. Above all she manages to make Christine authentic. Her reactions are just as you'd expect a real mother to act in such a situation. This isn't an easy performance to play off and carry with conviction given its complexities, I think Jolie did an extremely noteworthy job and received a deserved Oscar nomination.The film develops the themes of female disempowerment and corruption of the law with an appropriate subtlety. We see Christine's worries dismissed by men in charge, whether they are doctors or police chiefs, and just how easy it is for them to make her life even more of a struggle. The two high ranking police only appear to care about the public's image of the LAPD and Christine only finds support from a radio reverend. All of these roles are played with dependability, Jeffrey Donovan and Colm Feore as the seedy cops, John Malkovich going against type as the generous Reverend Briegleb. The film does well to reflect the nature of its period. There is an authenticity and stark beauty to the visuals, almost as if they were painted. You get a feel of the time and you never question it because it washes over you. The score provided by Eastwood fits the mood too, somewhat stark and lead by a sombre piano, it suits what is happening on screen perfectly. As the film builds we discover all kinds of secrets and corruptions. The film leaves you thrilled and shocked, upset but hopeful, it manages to bring in so many emotions without making them feel forced like so many films of its style do. Eastwood is clearly in his element with films that tell deep stories about people, he gives them heart without losing sight of the story that he is trying to bring to life. In Jolie he has an actress who handles the material with grace and courage, who becomes the person we care about and want to succeed. There is a mystery that unravels excellently and Christine's case becomes all the more engaging as it does. Most importantly the film very rarely sags or loses focus, I was completely engaged from beginning to end. It gave me plenty to be entertained by, be involved with and finally reflect upon.",7,0,0,13 June 2016
Skyfall," A welcomed call back to the Connery classics
","Bond Review. Title: A cool title and plays a part in the story. Pre-Titles: In Istanbul Bond and fellow agent Eve pursue a mercenary who has stolen a computer drive. Whilst Bond fights the man on a train, Eve is order to shoot and accidentally 'kills' Bond. This is a brilliant opening. It is well set-up, the stunt work is excellent and it is all very exciting. I love how the action gets bigger from cars to motorbikes to the top of a train and without it feeling too overblown.Theme Song: Adele provides a classy and suitably moody theme. It is in the same vein as Shirley Bassey's work on the series and a pleasant call back to the Connery era theme songs. Most of it is thanks to a beautifully delicate piano melody, mysterious lyrics and soaring vocals.Plot: MI6 is being attacked by a force that is believed to be from M's past. Bond returns from his absence and follows a trail that leads to one time agent Raoul Silva who is seeking revenge against MI6 for its apparent betrayal of him during his service. This is probably the most personal story in the series and it is that uniqueness that makes it so effective. Well finally get a pure look at the M character, her relationships with her agents and even a look into Bond's origins. Silva's scheme is set-up excellently and is interesting, whilst the relationships between the characters are developed and feel real.James Bond: Daniel Craig does a truly brilliant job. He's probably the closest thing to Connery here in making Bond well balanced in each aspect as he's ruthless, sardonic, witty and charming in just the right amount. Craig also nails the more expressive scenes as well as being believable as a wearier and wiser Bond, while his relationships with M and the new Q are excellent.Bond Girls: The Bond girls are probably the weakest point. Naomie Harris is decent as Eve and delivers her lines with a warm charm, but she just doesn't convincing in the action sequences and doesn't have much chemistry with Craig. Berenice Marlohe is very good as Severine and has an engaging presence, but the character is given little screen time and has absolutely no development. Villains: Javier Bardem is fantastic as Silva. He has an interesting look, delivers some really effective lines and feels like an intellectual as well as physical threat. The fact that Silva's a hacker is a smart update and even the homosexual undertones work surprisingly well. His motivation makes sense and his link to M is explored excellently, while Bardem succeeds in being memorable. Support: Judi Dench is superb as M. She adds a more sympathetic side to the character and her relationship with Craig is just wonderful, while every word she says and every expression she makes feels real. Ralph Fiennes is great as usual as the tough intelligence chairman Mallory and Albert Finney brings warmth as gamekeeper Kincade, while Ben Whishaw is fantastic as the new youthful computer smart Q and brings a lot of subtle humour to the role.Action: The action is brilliant. Bond tracking the mercenary and fighting him in one of the Shanghai buildings is shot amazingly. We get a fun fight with some komodo dragons that hearkens back to the Connery fights. The whole sequence of Bond chasing Silva through London is just fantastic in every aspect, while the shootout in the enquiry room is great too. The climax is superb and is effectively Bond does Home Alone as he tries to protect Skyfall, it's packed with tension and nicely inventive.Score: Thomas Newman provides an excellent score. He simply creates a great balance as his compositions move between pounding intense pieces to sweeping classic sounding arrangements, while incorporating oriental sounds and subtle electronics smartly.Production Values: Sam Mendes does a great job with the direction. He knows when to keep it simple and how to create memorable imagery which is exactly what you want from a Bond director. The visuals are a highlight. This is possibly the best looking film of the series, there are so many beautiful shots when Bond is in Shanghai thanks to a really expressive colour scheme and the shots of the Scottish hills are just oozing with atmosphere. The writing is very good. The characters are believable and their motivations are plausible, this is very much a character driven film and the plot fits around this direction smartly. The dialogue has a just the right mix of intelligence and humour. In fact the humour in this film is effective because it is so low-key, it shows that you can do a serious Bond film and have plenty of amusing bits throughout. As noted the locations are brilliant and are all captured perfectly.Conclusion: Skyfall is a fantastic Bond film in every sense of the word. It is constantly entertaining while managing to be gritty, funny and stylish whenever it is called for. Daniel Craig is just superb here and he really does include everything you want a Bond actor to have. Judi Dench is outstanding in a bigger role, Javier Bardem makes a memorable villain, the supporting actors are fantastic, the action is very enjoyable, the score is engaging and the visuals are spectacular. Sure the female leads are a little weak and the plot may well be too convoluted for some, but this is Bond at its most entertaining and it is a welcomed return to form.",7,2,11,1 August 2015
Iron Man 3," Ends the trilogy with a bang!
","After two successful solo films, the onus was on Iron Man 3 to bring the trilogy to an effective conclusion while continuing to develop some much loved characters. Shane Black is mainly known for his sharp, dialogue driven scripts and in a way it made sense for him to direct given Downey Jr.'s hyper performance. There is certainly more comedy and drama here, and surprisingly they are both mixed together very effectively. Personally I think Iron Man 3 is something of a triumph, being very different in style to the previous two films while managing to craft a complex story and place the characters in interesting situations.Story: Tony Stark's world begins to crumble when an international terrorist called the Mandarin targets him and destroys all of his equipment. Stark has to go out on his own to find the link between bombings in the US and discovers that an even greater force is backing the Mandarin. The storyline is played excellently throughout, offering interesting problems for Stark to overcome and some twists that are pleasantly surprising. The big twist itself is superbly done. The way it balances multiple aspects is impressive as Stark is made the centre of the film, the villains get enough time to develop personalities and even the supporting characters have a part to play in proceedings.Hero: Robert Downey Jr. is excellent once again and gets even more to do this time around. He is still as sardonic and flippant as ever which allows for many laughs, yet he also gets to show Stark's struggle to deal with PTSD and he manages to get a lot of emotion across in those scenes. He balances both aspects perfectly and you do feel like he has gone through a journey by the films end.Villains: Guy Pearce does a solid job as the crooked inventor Killian. He might be a touch one-dimensional at times, but Pearce injects the character with an easy to hate smugness and he does feel like a genuine threat. Ben Kingsley is simply fantastic here given his key role. He manages to make the Mandarin appear as a ruthless terrorist along with a funny voice, then show that the man behind him is simply a deadbeat and he is absolutely hilarious in those scenes.Support: Gwyneth Paltrow has grown into her role as Pepper and does a good job here. Again the scenes between her and Downey Jr. sparkle thanks to their chemistry, while she even handles some action scenes convincingly. Don Cheadle is excellent again as Rhodes as he continues to convince as a man of action, gets some good laughs and he is involved in the plot more this time around. Rebecca Hall is decent enough in a small but important role and Ty Simpkins does a good job as a kid who helps Stark out.Action: The action sequences are all flashy and exciting. The attack on Stark's home is shot very well and has a surprising amount of intensity to it, especially given what's at stake. There is a fantastic fight in an aeroplane and a mid-air rescue that is rather silly but still very entertaining. The climactic battle at a dock is overblown in the best sense of the word and seems to be continuously adding more obstacles to overcome, but it is extremely stylish and it does show our heroes having to dig as deep as possible.Music: Brian Tyler's score is excellent. While the guitars don't return, it uses some very emotive melodies and pounding compositions to really drive home the atmosphere or tension in certain scenes. Many arrangements are very memorable and well crafted.Production: Despite not being known for his directing skills, Shane Black does a fine job here. He directs the dialogue heavy scenes with a lot of vigour which lets the lines leap out and the action scenes are all appropriately stylish. The script is where the film truly shines. Black is at his best here. because the snappy and sharp dialogue that he is known for fits in seamlessly when provided by the likes of Downey Jr. as its pretty much a match made in heaven. Some might argue that it is a little too comedic in places, but I think it works to the films advantage. In fact the comedy is some of the best Marvel has provided, especially with the likes of Downey Jr.'s numerous witty lines and his scenes with Simpkins. Visually the film continues much of the ultra-modern look from the previous films and setting the majority of it at Christmas is actually a very smart move in giving the film a different edge. CGI is used a lot, especially during the climax, but it always blends in well and is only really used to add to the film.Conclusion: I really enjoyed Iron Man 3 and would probably say it's the best of the trilogy. The film has no major weak points and I think all the differing elements come together successfully to form a very fun as well as interesting film. I always cared about the characters and how their story arcs were played out, whilst the story twisted in some ways that I really wasn't expecting which lead to some nice surprises. Downey Jr. was just wonderful once again, the villains were different to the norm, the support was great and the action was gripping throughout. Black's direction and writing were exceptional, all of it resulting in a superhero film with an abundance of wit and excitement.",6,0,1,24 November 2015
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Extremely enjoyable
","One Hundred and One Dalmatians is a classic Disney film from the company's brilliant late 50's and early 60's period. The film has a number of Disney high points including fantastic supporting characters, great suspense and a heavy atmosphere. The film can be considered another excellent feature for the legendary company.The story sees Dalmatian Pongo and his 'pet' Roger find love with two of their kind in Perdita and Anita. When Perdita gives birth to 15 puppies the cruel Cruella De Vil wishes to buy them but is turned away. With the help of her bumbling henchmen she kidnaps the puppies in order to make fur coats of them. Its then up to Pongo and Perdita, with the help of a collection of animals, to find the puppies and return to London. The story is simplistic but wonderfully executed. It has so many great elements that make it such an engaging movie, from the way dogs view their owners to the many escape attempts. The characters are superb. Rod Taylor is perfect as the very likable Pongo who we see as brave and caring as the film goes on. The relationship between him and Perdita is better than most as they do care for each other. Cruella is one of Disney's stronger villains, it's the way she is so crazed and manic but always trying to be stylish that makes her so entertaining. Jasper and Horace are brilliant henchmen, supplying lots of fun comic relief. Their so inept and clumsy that there's never a dull moment with them. The team of the Colonel, Tibbs and the Captain are brilliant. The Colonel is lovingly silly and Tibbs is so likable due to his never say die attitude. Roger and Anita are good as they are presented as a normal pleasant couple. The other dogs that help out like Danny the Great Dane and Towser are nice, solid supporting characters.Though the rougher animation isn't to everyone's taste it does fit in really well here. The way it looks fits in with the gritty darkness of London and the wilds of the countryside, it's a nice change from the angular style of the films preceding it. When you consider the amount of puppies they had to animate it's an impressive feat. It is certainly one of the Disney's most suspense filled and exciting films. It's not very often that a Disney climax has a car chase and it's an outstanding sequence. The whole search for the puppies has a brilliantly tense feel and watching Cruella search for them has some really well made strong moments. This leads on to another highlight which is the atmosphere the film has. The whole 'twilight bark' is a great piece and the scenes where Tibbs and the Colonel investigate the matter have a really effective dark feel. These are underlined by the superb visuals of a gloomy London and the demonic looking 'hell hall'. The music is also very memorable as it contains the usual solid score Disney does, as well as the fantastic songs ''Cruella De Vil'' and ''Dalmatian Plantation''. The other effective scenes include a humorous look at how dog owners are similar to their pets and the what's my crime TV show that's funny. This is one of Disney's most entertaining movies filled with many great elements.",8,17,17,31 October 2013
Mulan," Dragon!
","Coming out at the end of the Disney renaissance and after a small string of films with a more mixed reception, Mulan can be seen as the film that called back to the earlier films of this period. It took a simple yet interesting premise and gave it plenty of emotional heft as well as comedy in an attempt to reconnect with a general audience. For the most part it is successful in achieving what its original aim with even a little extra added because of its more cultural and historical basis. Though it is by no means amongst Disney's strongest works, it is a very well made and frequently enjoyable piece.The story of Mulan is loosely based on the Chinese legend of the same name. It sees the Huns invade ancient China and the man of every house must join the army. Because Mulan's father is too ill to fight she takes his place and must impersonate a man or face the death penalty if found out. This is a very good premise and an area Disney has only really touched on before, with the themes of fighting for your country and war. It gives us something Disney enjoy which is a main character fighting against adversity and here it's in more ways than one. It also successfully walks the fine line between seriousness and comedic, balancing both out effectively within the story.Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) isn't that interesting yet she is meant to be a normal person thrown into a crazy situation and for that she's just fine, she is likable and does get plenty of comedic moments. The army men, including the likes of Yao and Ling, are amongst the best things here. They all have distinct personalities and provide a number of laughs, whenever they're on screen its always funny. Li Shang is just okay and doesn't have much development, but he is heroic and easy to route for on the whole. Chi-Fu is a good snobbish character and James Hong is always enjoyable. I'm not a big fan of Mulan's dragon aid Mushu and think his more self-aware comedic stylings don't fit the film at all, Eddie Murphy provides a lot of energy but it just doesn't work for me.The animation is really impressive. It is very smooth and scenic for the most part, while managing to get across the beauty of China. When I think of the film I think of a lot of wilderness and mountains which always look picturesque throughout. The scenes showing the vast army of the Huns are very striking too. It also perfectly lent itself to the comic scenes and allowed for some amusing slapstick. The situation comedy is a highlight. Mulan's interactions with her fellow troops are usually hilarious and the comedy flows very naturally as a result, most of it is timeless slapstick or smart wordplay as she tries to hide her identity and fit in. The action scenes are good too. There is a genuine tension to the battle scenes and the film manages to convey just how big they are.It isn't all without issue however. Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) is such a dull villain. Apart from an intimidating design there is absolutely nothing of note about him. I can't recall a line of his dialogue or any actions of his. He shows up to fight and that's effectively it, he has next to no development. The music isn't that good either. None of the songs featured where memorable and most of them didn't really fit the scenes that they were playing over. Jerry Goldsmith's score is serviceable, but again it's just a touch forgettable overall. We don't get as much of a look at the Chinese culture as I'd have liked either, but then that isn't really the films focus. Mulan is another very entertaining Disney film. It doesn't go as serious with the story as it could have done or try anything new with it, but what it does do it does very well. The animation is excellent, the story is something a bit different and the situational comedy was a lot of fun. Of course some characters are a bit unbalanced, the villain is extremely weak and the songs are forgettable. Yet none of these issues truly harm the rest of the enough to damage it as a whole. It is nearly always engaging and delivers more than enough amusement throughout.",7,1,1,12 October 2015
Unbreakable," What if a superhero did exist?
","Where did M. Night Shyamalan go wrong? Touted as one of the best directors of modern time due to his deep stories, ability to get great performances and twist endings. It all seemed to fall apart after Signs and whilst many believe The Sixth Sense to be his best film, in my view it is his 'real life' and extremely underrated superhero origin tale Unbreakable. This is the film that shows Shyamalan's potential in all its glory. Plus we finally get a quiet and sombre look at superheroes, putting Marvel's bombastic and cheesy work to shame. Security guard David Dunn becomes the sole survivor of a train derailment, which he didn't even receive a scratch from. His crumbling marriage and job worries are then put into perspective. David is later contacted by a comic book specialist named Elijah, who has a rare bone disorder, who makes a detailed claim that David might just be a real life superhero. The story is one of the films strongest points and effectively what makes the film so intriguing. That one question of, what if a superhero existed in real life? The detailed and very introspective look at that question through the eyes of two men is what sells the film in my view. The story is all you could possibly want it to be, striking, stylish, gloomy and uplifting all rolled into one intelligent ball. Those who don't like slow films won't enjoy the time taken to build things up, but those who appreciate the craft will be rewarded.Considering how important the characters to the overall story, the acting had to be exceptional to make the characters seem real and thankfully it is especially from the two leads. Bruce Willis seals, for me anyway, himself as a truly top actor as David. He gives an incredibly understated performance that works wonders, his expressions are so powerful that he rarely needs dialogue to get across what he wants. Willis' reserved turn adds layers to the disheartened Dunn that not many could. Luckily his equal is seen in Samuel L. Jackson as the broken Elijah. Jackson also offers a very, compared to his usual work, low-key turn as a man who prays for there to be someone who is the opposite of him. His sombre performance works the same way as Willis' in adding complex layers to the character.The support is excellent which is key due to the main roles being the focal point. Robin Wright puts in a very authentic performance as David's isolated wife. She allows herself to fit into the background whilst remaining memorable due to her genuine and sensitive portrayal. Spencer Treat Clark is equally good, you genuinely feel for him as he is willing for his dad to be special. He showed a calm and delicate presence despite his young age.One thing that really sets the film apart is the way it is shot and how the cinematography feels rather unique. There is an almost saturated view that the film takes on which means that certain colours used really standout, especially blue and silver that give the film an almost comic- book styling. Shyamalan knows how to use the camera with skill as shown by the very slow moving shots which help to create atmosphere and his focus upon the characters which gives us more of an insight into how they feel through their expressions. Certain visual representations also strike me as being very, such as the frequent associations of glass to Elijah due to his condition and the way David's security hood later acts as his 'costume' per-say as both a smart allusions to superhero mythos.Themes play a big part in the films story and the way it presents as well as tries to answer the ideas it sets up is brilliantly executed. The focus being placed on isolation and trying to find a place in the world are developed with a delicate understanding that most films don't attempt to craft. David is presented as a man with sadness hanging over his head and this idea that he might be special is his chance to fit in as he sees it. These also fit the personas of both main characters which gives another subtle comparison between the two. The psychological themes that the film develops between David and Elijah add to its intelligence and insight. Importantly the superhero mythos works as we get references such as David having his own kryptonite and his power of super-strength. The intense scenes are just that. The scenes were David's son tries to prove he is special by shooting him and the confrontation with the 'Orange Man' really does pile on the tension with very successful results. Shyamalan's well-known twist is here and people appeared divided over this. For me the twist was very smart and fit the film well, it wrapped things up nicely and came across as being quite well thought-out. The score is just magnificent and really stands out. James Newton Howard deserves far more plaudits for his incredible work here. It is such a beautifully sombre and moving piece of work that it adds wonderfully to the films already thoughtful nature. Unbreakable is one of those films that is unjustly dismissed and that might be down to Shyamalan's increasingly bad reputation. But, in fairness, if this is your best film then you've done a bloody good job in my eyes. There's so much that the film has going for it, I love the superhero ideals behind it, I love the two leading performances, I love the score and I love the gripping narrative. This is the superhero film alternative for those who want a 'real life' film and those who want a quitter intelligent film. Unbreakable is one of those films that stays in your head and makes you really think, and films that do that are special.",10,0,1,29 October 2013
Memento," As Hollow as it is Pretentious
","Memento is a film that I will never be able to understand the hype around. A curious but completely uninvolving piece from a director often criticised for being all brain and no heart (maybe the signs for that began earlier than most think). The whole draw of the film was its backwards moving narrative which reveals the details of the story in reverse order. I can only ask, what happens when that isn't enough? Take that away and this is a lacklustre, rambling, confused film that is trying to bite off more than it can chew. No matter how much you try to get away from it, the film is based entirely around a gimmick. Sure it's an inventive one, but you take that away and you're left with a bland murder mystery that plays out with equally dull individuals. Our lead character Leonard suffers from a form of amnesia, were he can't create new memories, and is trying to figure out who killed his wife by using clues that he has already created. This structure itself is just a mess. We see Leonard write on polaroid's and try to recall events, we see a scene play out, then another scene happen which is connected to the beginning of what we just saw and so on. I'm not exaggerating, over two thirds of the film are exactly that. It gets tiresome about half an hour in. There's no suspense or mystery because we've just seen what will happen, so what's there to be invested in? How he got there isn't of any interest.The film is ice cold. Too distant. Far out of reach. Way too impersonal. There is no way the audience can get connected to anything that takes place. The film makes no attempt to get us to sympathise with Leonard bar his mental obstacle, which isn't enough, and the rest of the characters are just sleazebags or wholly unpleasant. The actions of the characters make little sense, even once you find out their true motivation. Teddy's role is one which should have been mysterious and gripping, but it started off as baffling and ended up making no sense whatsoever by the time the film concludes. I actually realised that I wouldn't have cared at all about anything that takes place in the film if it had been told in chronological order. The further it progressed (or is it regressed?), the more detached and bored I felt. In Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano you have some fine actors that are completely wasted in parts that don't allow them to do anything of interest. All of them are shackled to the plot and restrained as a result. I feel for Pearce the most, he's playing a character so thinly sketched and loaded with quirks that there's virtually nothing he can do with the role. It's here that the entire narrative device falls down too. If it is trying to put us in his shoes then it fails because we feel nothing for the character. Beyond that Leonard is simply a muddled lead, and not just because of amnesia. He has tattoos all over his body that offer him information which he doesn't remember getting and yet he trusts what is written completely. If he has no short-term memory then how can he believe any of the details to be correct? That's not even nit-picking, that's a major flaw that isn't explained. There are a host of plot holes like that based around the entire memory loss area. This is clearly Nolan's attempt to craft a twisting film that can measure up to the ones made by the likes of Kubrick and Hitchcock. Something deeply psychological and with a noir twinge, with the reverse chronology being an added bonus. His first problem is that he doesn't create suspense properly. Partly because we're already a step ahead of the characters, partly because he's given us characters that we cannot gain a connection to. Then you have the writing. The dialogue is painfully simple at times, just lacking any dynamism or sharpness that could hold our attention. It's as if Nolan thinks the characters have to spell out what already a simple plot because we're too stupid to get it. I have little problems with his camera-work and the shooting style is vibrant, but it's clear that this is his debut and it's one he fails to get a grasp of. Maybe he was trying to be too ambitious by going straight for such a story first time round, I'm not too sure.The film ends with a twist that is so nonsensical on a grand scale that I can't help but feel angered that I sat through the entire thing. All of that for such a lousy payoff. What is key to note is that there is no substance to anything. It is a very basic mystery wrapped up in a gimmick that will make people think it's doing something unique and propelled by characters that are as one-note as possible. It is borderline pretentious. It's almost like people think that because the narrative style is unique that the film must be exceptional. Well the main thing stopping that is that it's not remotely entertaining or interesting to watch. It doesn't matter how clever a film is, if it's a dull mess then it's a dull mess.",2,7,12,17 July 2016
Iron Man 2," Solid follow-up
","Iron Man 2 was certainly a film that had a lot to live up to. The first film was a major success with both audiences and critics, helping to continue the surge in popularity over comic book films. The film tries to continue the development and issues faced by Tony Stark along with adding interesting characters, yet it also suffers from feeling like it is setting up for something down the line and it does feel like there are too many characters vying for adequate screen time. So while I don't think the film holds up to the original and does have some problems, it manages to provide sufficient excitement and delivers much of what it promises.Story: With the world now aware that Tony Stark is Iron Man and the government pressuring him to reveal his technology, Stark faces a threat from a Russian with ties to his father and a weapons rival trying to recreate his technology. He also learns more about his past and is informed of a proposed superhero team by Shield. I think the basic story is good and the individual story strands are gripping, but I don't think it is executed that well. It gets very convoluted and not enough characters get screen time with so much happening. We have Stark struggle with his new life, the government on his back, his technology being copied, a falling out with Rhodes, learning about his purpose and having issues with Shield. That is a lot going on and none of it gets enough attention as a result. Hero: Robert Downey Jr. continues where he left of by successfully making Stark a sarcastic and brash yet funny and lovable rogue. He gets a little more to do this film, doing a solid job at capturing the characters increasing struggles though a minor issue is that he might spend too much of the film moping around. However he certainly provides energy and laughs in abundance.Villains: Technically Sam Rockwell as weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer is the main adversary. Rockwell always plays smug characters well and it's more of the same here, making Hammer arrogant and slimy in all the right ways. Maybe he's a little one-dimensional but it works fine. Mickey Rourke as Russian ex-con Ivan Vanko gets shafted somewhat. Rourke succeeds in making the character mysterious and tough along with a believable accent, but he simply doesn't get much to do and his role ends up feeling tacked on in the grand scheme of things.Support: Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodes and he does a fantastic job. Cheadle brings a lot of class to the role and has great chemistry with Downey Jr. as well as being believable in the action scenes. I still find Gwyneth Paltrow to be a little bland, though she does a passable job. Scarlett Johansson gets little to do as Romanoff and doesn't do much with the part except look good, but that may be down to the script. Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as always as Shield head Nick Fury.Action: The action sequences are rather similar to the first film with plenty of impressive and exciting spectacle. It's always fun to see Iron Man in mid-flight whilst it's no different here and as always it is shot excellently. The fight with Vanko at the F1 arena is a lot of fun, though you could argue the action is too widely spread out. The climax is just an ever increasing battle against drones, but it is thrilling and is as massive an ending as you could want.Music: John Debney's score suffers from being very bland. It's difficult to recall any interesting compositions and the heavy guitar sound that stood out so much in the first film is badly missed here. The pieces during the action scenes blend into the background and there is little from the score in the way of atmosphere as a result.Production: For the most part the script flows well and most of the character motivations are made clear, with only a few out of place lines here and there. I think they could have played out Stark's struggles a little better and you could argue that it takes away the fact that he is such an upbeat hero, but I'm still glad that they tried to tackle such an issue. The film looks as stylish as the original and some of the ultra-modern technology used adds a nice touch, while Favreau once again shows that he is equally at ease when handling action or drama. The CGI looks fantastic and is used appropriately. The comedic moments are played down a little more here and that works during the more serious moments, yet it does take away some of the uniqueness and some of jokes are a little overblown too. As said the film did feel like a set-up with a lot of talk about Shield's plans and how Stark father had a purpose for him, which gets in the way of the story it's trying to tell. Conclusion: Iron Man 2 certainly offers all the excitement and fun that you would want it to, but it doesn't compare to the original and its problems come from too much going on. When it focuses on its own plot it works fine with Downey Jr. enjoyable, most of the cast good and the action being very entertaining. However none of the side characters or villains get enough screen time and fail to make any impact as a result, whilst the film certainly feels as if its building up to something more instead of standing on its own. Having said that, when it concentrates it is a blast and shows that Marvel know how to provide enjoyment for its audience.",5,0,4,15 November 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," I have to admit...I really enjoyed Dead Man's Chest
","I'm going to present a somewhat 'unpopular' opinion when I say that Dead Man's Chest is probably my favourite of all the Pirates of the Caribbean films. The film is frequently overlooked, seeing as it is sandwiched between the surprisingly brilliant Curse of the Black Pearl and the confusingly bloated At Worlds End. Does it have faults? Of course it does, but it doesn't take away too much from the extremely enjoyable adventure that it is.This time round Captain Jack Sparrow is informed that he still has a blood debt with the legendary Davy Jones. Jack realises that he must find Jones' heart in order to rid himself of Jones and potential damnation for all eternity on the Flying Dutchman. Both Will and Elizabeth are roped into things when they are arrested and told that they will only be released if they find Jack's compass for the seedy Cutler Beckett. Believe me when I say this, there truly is a lot going on within the films plot. It's good that it doesn't get too complicated to follow, but it is constantly building upon itself. It could get away with a flimsy plot due to the concentration on adventure, so I'm glad it is trying to create an interesting storyline.What I really enjoy in the film is that it is just shamelessly entertaining, you don't get the feeling that the film is trying to do anything but keep you entertained and tell a gripping adventure tale. Sometimes films like that can feel pointless or forced, but the film has its heart in the right place and it never tries to be something it is not. It does remind me of swashbuckling films of old that simply relied on offering you some fun.After his Oscar nomination from the first film Johnny Depp returns and is just wonderful as everyone favourite pirate Jack Sparrow. There is just something so likable and entertaining about the character that Depp manages to play out to perfection. His slightly surly confidence and clumsy attitude is what does the trick, Depp just has the mannerisms that fit the part and even the slightest actions is made hilarious by him. When he is on screen things light up and I cannot help but laughThe supporting cast is excellent. Bill Nighy adds his usual quirky ticks and style to Davy Jones under heavy CGI, making an intimidating and complex villain. I really like Kevin McNally as Sparrow's superstitious right hand man Gibbs, it's a very likable and laid-back performance again. Jack Davenport is back the now run down drunkard Norrington adding more layers to the character. Stellan Skarsgard is solid as always as Will's haunted father and Tom Hollander is enjoyable are the slimy Beckett. The whole crew of the Pearl are always very amusing and have some very funny traits, like Cotton's parrot. The only actors I really have issues with are the other two leads. Orlando Bloom hearkens back to the good looking leads of old adventure flicks, but the guy is just plain dull. He just a bland actor and his stifled delivery always comes off as awkward. Keira Knightly is not much better, she just comes off as annoying and is also just a bland actress. I don't think the characters are bad, just the actors weren't right for the roles.The visuals of the film are extremely impressive. The locations alone look fantastic, whether they be at stormy sea or a white sand beach. The sheer amount of money the film cost to has clearly been used very well in order to make the film a visual feast. The CGI is amazing. The crew of the Flying Dutchman for example are all CGI added on to actors and the details look so lifelike is it hard to believe it isn't. The CGI on Davy Jones looks incredible and the sheer detail that has been put into his creation must be applauded. The seas look vast and dangerous, adding levels of suspense as the crew travel from place to place. The Kraken is another CGI piece that is used well and looks amazing. The action set- pieces are excellent as usual. The triple sword fight inside a rolling water mill is absolutely superb, both from a visual standpoint and as an entertaining action scene. The climatic ship battle is also outstanding. The films tone manages to be balanced nicely. Is the humour still here? You better believe it. Jack's first appearance and escape from a native tribe are truly hilarious. It's the small amusing things that complete the comedic sensibility. Depp's spaced out expressions, the quirks of the Pearl crew and even Tom Hollander's droll delivery are all small things that add to the humour. There are some darker elements, but the film only concentrates on them slightly which is understandable. Hans Zimmer delivers another excellent score which creates a sound that evokes the perfect balance of excitement and tension.Dead Man's Chest is the example of a middle film done right in my eyes. It doesn't try anything too different to the first film, but it does move away enough to feel like its own entity as well as a continuation of the story. The film was by no means perfect, the plot does have a bit too much going on at times and the large amounts of CGI can get excessive. Yet the pure entertainment style is very welcoming, the action is spectacular, Johnny Depp is hilarious once again and all kinds of humour are present here. I think Dead Man's Chest is as good as the first and an exceedingly enjoyable adventure romp.",8,1,3,26 January 2014
Public Enemies," Good Fun but Slightly Underwhelming
","Michael Mann is one of the few directors where I'll happily watch anything that he is involved in. He is an expert when it comes to telling big stories and keeping them engaging, always fleshing out his characters and writing dialogue that leaps off the screen. Most importantly though his films always leave some kind of impact upon you and really make you consider the stories they are trying to tell. Public Enemies focuses on the famed bank-robber John Dillinger, who became something of a celebrity in his day due to his crimes never actually hurting innocent people. Whilst also looking at the FBI force, led by Melvin Purvis, out to catch him. With Johnny Depp and Christian Bale in the lead roles you're thinking this could be something special with Mann's directing, yet the film falls short where Mann's other films have soared and never becomes anything more than an entertaining little piece.The story focuses on three areas in Dillinger's crime exploits, his relationship with a girl named Billie and the FBI's efforts to catch him. I think all three areas are handled adequately, but never anything more than that. The crimes and shootouts are exciting to watch but nothing we haven't seen before. The romance is very believable but could have been delved into more. It is interesting to see the workings of the FBI yet more could have been shown of their efforts and plans. The big problem with the film appears here. It is enjoyable but it severely lacks the pathos and grandness of Mann's other works, while on the flip side it doesn't go into enough detail on Dillinger himself to be an intriguing character piece that is could have been. It is stuck somewhere between these two styles and would have fared better if it had picked one to go for.Mann is capable as ever behind the camera, he knows how to make the dialogue interesting and create a sense of location. It must be said however that the hand-held camera work and shooting the film in digital do get in the way many times, mainly due some irritating shaky cam and some shots looking distinctly amateur because of the low resolution. Not to mention that quite a lot of the film is shot in close-ups which does appear somewhat unambitious at times. Johnny Depp does a good job with what is a difficult type of performance, he makes Dillinger charismatic and gives his relationships an air of believability. The problems with the role are mostly due to the writing as we're never given a true insight into Dillinger and what makes him tick. Its all well and good making him stylish but there needs to be a complexity to such a character. Christian Bale is solid as Purvis and offers the intensity we've come to expect from his performances, but he is also let-down by the writing. Purvis simply isn't fleshed beyond wanting to take down his prey and he has nothing more than that, we're not shown any witty or intellectual side to the character. Marion Cotillard is good as Billie, bringing a sense of style and respectability to what could have been a forgettable role. Stephen Dorff, Jason Clarke, Billy Crudup and Stephen Graham show themselves as fine actors despite their limited characterisations.The action scenes are very effectively done and have the appropriate amount of tension, it is certainly an area that Mann knows how to do well as he has shown many times in the past. The shootouts and the bank robberies had a real excitement to them as there was a sense of vulnerability to both sides. The sequence at the woodland lodge was extremely gripping and there was an unpredictability to the outcome which is something Mann has done in the past, keeping you gripped to the screen as a result. Dillinger's eventual downfall also lacks the bite that you would expect and is something of an anti-climax given the build-up. Some of the commentary that the film gets in is quite welcomed. The way that Dillinger becomes something of a celebrity whilst the FBI is shown in a not so positive light is smartly done especially considering that most films tackle this aspect in a heavy-handed manner.So Public Enemies falls short mainly because of its unsure story- telling and weak characters. I think the plot, acting and directing are all solidly done yet that is also part of the issue. They're all done well but never especially well because it is lacking in the key areas. You know Mann will provide the goods in these areas but he can never propel the film onward because of the script. We never really know anything in detail about the characters we follow and as a result the film isn't as gripping as it could have been because we are kept at arms length at all times. As said the film would have benefited greatly if it either decided to go all out and tell a big story or if it was an understated character study, but as it falls somewhere in the middle it never reaches its potential. It's all good fun and easy to enjoy, but it is not a film that will get you thinking and it is rather underwhelming when its all said and done.",4,1,1,3 March 2016
Spider-Man 2," Does Whatever a Spider Can
","After Spider-Man's success there were naturally high hopes for its sequel. Raimi showed with the Evil Dead trilogy that he knows how to tweak and develop a continuation within his films. That turns out to be one of the films strongest suits, it continues to grow and build onto the themes established in the first film whilst adding new layers of material. By this second outing Raimi and his cast are so comfortable in their roles that it does become a genuinely enjoyable film. The film is often claimed to be the best of the trilogy and that is something I'd have to agree with. It's far from perfect and shares some of its predecessor's flaws, but when it hits the right notes it is great entertainment.Story: Peter's struggle to balance his two lives hits breaking point when his powers appear to be fading and Mary Jane becomes engaged to someone else. Elsewhere a failed fusion experiment leaves scientist Otto Octavius psychologically damaged and with four mechanical arms, which he uses in an attempt to recreate the experiment. I was really impressed by how well the film balanced out both of these stories, giving them appropriate time and space to breathe. I certainly think Peter's emotional journey is one of the films highlights and there is a great deal of emotion to those scenes. It's also nice that Doctor Octopus isn't simply a mad man, but a very intelligent and conflicted person with his instability causing his actions.Hero: Tobey Maguire is excellent as Peter here. He sells every emotion with subtlety and makes some shaky dialogue sound very natural. There is an honesty and warmth in his performance which makes the Peter so endearing. His Spider-Man suffers in comparison as he does lack wit and confidence, but I still think he does okay in the suit and it still manages to fit the character.Villain: Alfred Molina is a standout as Octavius because he balances both sides of the character to perfection. At first he's very thoughtful and charming, but after the accident there is a ruthlessness and cunning that he manages to get across with his expressions alone. By giving the character so many dimensions it makes it easier to be invested in his struggle.Support: Kirsten Dunst is good as Mary Jane and brings charm to the role, yet the character is frustrating. Her anger at Peter's apparent lack of support is understandable, but she once again becomes a plot device for Peter to rescue. It's annoying by this point. James Franco is fine as a more vengeful Harry Osborn, even if he does overplay the part at times. Rosemary Harris is a great Aunt May and her elegant delivery gives the dialogue a real zest. J. K. Simmons is simply wonderful as Jameson, his comic timing is perfect and he delivers constant laughs whenever on screen.Action: The action sequences are much improved over the first film. We again get plenty of shots of Spider-Man swinging through the city and intervening in police chases, with the refined CGI adding intensity to those pieces. Both the climax and the fight at the bank were well constructed. The highlight however is certainly the train sequence. It's a fight that is both wildly creative and appropriately hard-hitting with a great deal at stake for our hero.Music: Danny Elfman's score is more of the same. It lacks any new sounds, but it definitely fits the films tone and always provides the correct amount of bombast or calmness.Production: Sam Raimi directs the film with a flair and imagination that surpasses his work on the original film. He captures the vastness of the city well and gives an identity to a lot of the places we end up visiting. Visually the film is very impressive too, with a great number of scenes resembling images you would expect to find on the comic book page (Peter discarding his suit being just one of them). The writing and tone is where the film really splits for me. Much of the material involving Peter's struggles with Mary Jane and the guilt he feels over Uncle Ben's death is excellent, both in its acting and the grace with which it is pulled off. The scenes that Peter and Aunt May share are always so naturalistic. However, the film has too many ill-fitting or goofy moments that clash with the more honest tone. Peter has to deliver some really bad lines, his interactions with Harry get more clichéd throughout and even the Mary Jane dilemma feels weak by the end. The also extras have to be mentioned as I have no idea what's going on with them. It feels like way too many get unnecessary screen time and they all seem to act in a stilted, robotic way that is extremely unnatural.Conclusion: Spider-Man 2 is an example of a film that improves upon the previous film and adds onto what that film was trying to get across, but it doesn't quite reach the heights that it could have reached. My issues with the film are nearly all down to writing and tone. The film does have a playfulness and sense of fun that frequently works well with its more sober moments, yet it pushes itself into silliness a few times too many and that dilutes some of the more serious material. I certainly think Raimi's direction is as stimulating as ever, whilst the action is better and the acting (especially from Molina and Maguire) is impressive all round. It's by no means flawless, but I do think it's a very entertaining entry and one that is easy to get wrapped up in.",7,0,3,8 June 2016
Batman Returns," Batman Returns, but he probably shouldn't have bothered
","Batman Returns (well sort of) in the sequel to the 1989 smash hit. This feels much more like a Tim Burton project and much less like an actual Batman film. Batman is here of course, but he has a much more subdued role to play in proceedings and Returns likes to concentrate on its villains a lot more than it does on the caped crusader. It became infamous at the time due to many complaining about its violence and grim tone. Yet that's not the issue, the first film had a dark tone, as the problems lie with the storyline and the ideas the film tries to bring to life.Story: The bizarre story features the Penguin, deformed and abandoned as a child, rise from the sewers and attempt to become mayor of Gotham with the help of shady businessman Max Shreck. Elsewhere, Catwoman is created after Shreck attempts to kill his secretary and she causes havoc around Gotham. It's up to Batman to find out their plans and stop them. The plot is all over the place and makes little sense. It doesn't make sense why the Penguin would want to be mayor and Catwoman has no motivation to do what see does. Batman just seems to be shoehorned into things as the villains are given no reason to be against him and he barely gets any screen time, again this is meant to be Batman 'Returns'.Batman: Keaton returns and he's given very little to do here. His Batman is still enjoyably mysterious and brooding, even if he is too cruel. His Bruce Wayne is pretty dull and doesn't act like Wayne should, he's too awkward and not the charismatic playboy we should expect. There's not enough separation with both roles either, when he's Bruce he just acts like Batman without the mask. He doesn't get enough screen time to make a big impression and has no arch which just makes him feel wasted.Villains: Danny DeVito plays the grotesque Penguin and he's nothing like the Penguin should be. It's just a bad character, he's just a freak and has none of the wit or charm needed for the role. We don't feel sorry for him and we don't care about his plight because the character is unsympathetic. DeVito gets into the role and looks ideal, but that's it. Michelle Pfeiffer is having fun as Catwoman and looks fantastic, but once again this isn't the true Catwoman. She isn't a thief and her interest in Batman seems like it was thrown in at the last minute. As said, her motivations make little sense and she just isn't that interesting to begin with. A disgruntled secretary who wants to try to get revenge on her boss, it's pretty weak for a Batman film.Support: Christopher Walken is wasted as Shreck. He's a wonderful actor and could have been superb in a creepy role, but Shreck has no substance. If you took the character out then it wouldn't make much of a difference. Michael Gough is great again and is given a little more to do here which is nice. Pat Hingle is given even less to do than before and his Gordon is useless, he has about 4 lines and his relationship with Batman is non-existent.Action: Burton isn't great at shooting action and it shows here. The opening fight scene is clumsy and just has Batman letting the Batmobile do all of the work. The little fights with Catwoman are pretty daft and the climax just has things exploding which gets dull. The issue is that Batman does a lot of un-Batman things here. He sets some guy on fire, plants a bomb on another and throws acid at Catwoman. It's very distracting and so out of place.Music: Danny Elfman's score is easily one of the highlights of the film. It is a lot more subdued, brooding and darker than before with some wonderfully haunting melodies as well as some suitably upbeat stuff when needed. It perfectly fits the wintery, Gothic look that the film possesses. I'd go as far as to say that this is Elfman's best score.Production: The best thing about the film is its look. The cinematography is truly spectacular. The sets look aptly gloomy and some of the building designs look great, especially Wayne Manor. The idea to set it at Christmas is also really clever as we get many beautifully atmospheric shots of snow falling and the wintery landscapes. The scene at the party with Bruce and Selina is done well too. Yet, similar to the following two films the writing gets silly. I don't want to hear Penguin spewing sexual puns like there's no tomorrow and Batman looks dumbfounded far too much (just look at his failure to save the Ice Princess). It too out of character and it's hard to know what the writers were thinking. There's no big set-pieces either here which harm the film. The opening with the Penguin as Moses is flat and nothing exciting happens in the climax. Conclusion: At the end of the day Batman Returns is a very flawed film. It has good elements as the look it goes for is wonderful and the score is brilliant, but it has so many daft parts. People point the finger at Schumacher but there's a lot of campy stuff here. A lot of people claim that the film is too dark, but I think that's it just too strange and daft for its own good. Most of the acting is iffy, the plot makes no sense, the action is uninspired and Batman is just a background player in his own film. At least Forever knew it was light and ran with the idea, if this is a serious Batman interpretation then something is very wrong.",4,30,48,6 January 2015
Finding Nemo," Yet another Pixar classic
","Upon its release Finding Nemo solidified Pixar's position as the masters of animation. Just like they did with Toy Story, they'd crafted another fine film that was packed with everything for children and adults alike. On a technical level it is a masterclass, but it also provided a flowing story and a wide variety of characters that it was easy to get invested in. The story concerns overprotective clown fish Marlin whose son Nemo is taken by divers and he then purses them across the ocean. Along the way he meets a fish with short-term memory loss named Dory, sharks who have quit eating fish and a party of sea turtles. The film is effectively Marlin's journey and the colourful characters he meets who help him on his way, whilst Nemo tries to escape from the dentist fish-tank that he's ended up in. The story is straight-forward, but it is packed with so much emotion and excitement that it works to its advantage.The plot works like a road trip movie, we continually come across some colourful characters and we move on, except that there is a goal to achieve at the end of it all. What really makes the story work is that it addresses the connection between a father and son as well as knowing when it's time to let your son have his own adventures. This helps give the film a strong emotional centre not just for the turmoil that Marlin and Nemo have been put through, but also for Dory who simply wants someone to stand by her. Working with the plot is the animation which is truly superb, some of Pixar's most impressive. The ocean can look both overwhelmingly beautiful and incredibly dangerous, while they really capture the vastness of the deep seas pretty perfectly. The colour scheme is also wonderful, everything from the bright character designs to the coral reef simply leaps off the screen in a wash of beauty. With that said, it's the characters that truly make the film shine. Marlin is a typically anxious and neurotic father, but he's never a stick in the mud. He always appears to be very genuine and the journey he's willing to undertake for his son makes him so likable. Dory (a brilliant Ellen DeGeneres) makes a fantastic companion. You'd think her memory loss would get annoying but it's kept fresh thanks to her bright sense of humour and her almost childlike wonder at the world which is surprisingly endearing. Nemo is a pleasant innocent and his enthusiasm is charming, whilst the tank gang are all very enjoyable especially the mysterious Gill. I also enjoyed the tanks pelican friend Nigel and the three sharks that come together like an AA meeting to discuss giving up fish. Virtually all of these characters are different and memorable, having interesting designs and distinctive personalities.Another big positive is the score by Thomas Newman. It is simply lovely. It manages to convey the wide-eyed wonder of the underwater world beautifully thanks to the gorgeous melodies and soothing compositions. There's a real sense of adventure to it that brings you into the ocean world even more and it manages to heighten the excitement at times perfectly. The film also has many memorable lines and inspired comedic pieces. Many of these were so successful that they are now widely known in pop culture, whether it the seagulls constantly repeating ''Mine!'' or the tanks outrageous escape plan. To be fair to it, the film has very few weaknesses. The lack of an over-arching villain isn't an issue because of the type of film it is and both stories are given the perfect amount of screen time.It's fair to say that Finding Nemo is up there with Pixar's best films. It excels in pretty much every area that matters because it does what Pixar does best, which is craft a gripping adventure that is packed with plenty of comedy and emotion. This is a story that is very easy to be engaged in and the massive amount of characters all manage to get enough development. So when the two key areas are as strong as they are here then the film is already on the right road. Adding to that, the animation is some of Pixar's most expressive, the score is wonderful and the film is simply very memorable. There is just something so gripping and rather timeless about the films approach that makes it such a success.",8,1,2,26 January 2016
Hot Fuzz," Hilarious buddy cop send-up
","Hot Fuzz is the second film in the 'Cornetto Trilogy' of spoofs from Edgar Wright's team up with Pegg and Frost. The film itself is easily up there with the best comedies of recent times. It's the perfect sent up of the action genre that features brilliant jokes, a hilariously gripping story and truly funny characters. The plot revolves around PC Nicolas Angel who is transferred from action packed London to the seemingly idyllic village of Sandford, where it's claimed there hasn't been a recorded murder for 20 years. Angel is can't accept the quiet lifestyle and the incompetent police force, until a number suspicious accidents take place which he feels are more than just coincidences. Angel and his partner Danny clash with everyone as they try to find the truth. The story flows brilliantly and keeps you guessing all the way as to what the truth is behind events, peppered with laughs and an explosive climax. You do get invested in Angel's mission and it does a wonderful job of mixing the comedy with some high octane action set pieces.The cast is superb. Simon Pegg is great as the stern Angel who has to adjust to the village, he does a brilliant job of being the straight man as he holds the centre of the film together. Nick Frost is really funny as his dim but well-meaning partner, his likability and blundering make him an engaging presence. Jim Broadbent was solid as usual as the chief inspector. Timothy Dalton was a highlight having the time of his life as the self-confident and sinister Skinner, he mixes in Bond like suaveness to great effect. Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall where excellent as the sarcastic 'two Andy's', both have some great lines as the chemistry between themselves and Pegg is excellent. Both Olivia Colman as the slow Doris and Kevin Eldon as the pretty useless Fisher round up the force superbly. The rest of the villagers fitted their roles effortlessly. Hot Fuzz is a flawless send up of the action genre. Nearly all the jokes hit the spot, whether they are parody (the references to Point Break and action puns are great such as 'Did you tell him to cool off?') or trying to deal with the local issues like a runaway swan, which is just hilarious. The film has a sharp with that means the jokes never let up and the British sensibility helps it shine. The funny thing is that the action scenes are actually better than most pure action films. The non- stop climax is just full of explosive fun action, it is incredibly well made and has a mix of gritty as well as hilariously painful scenes. Pegg and Frost make a faultless comedy double act, Pegg's invincible man is wonderfully played off by Frost's enthusiastic bumbler as both are perfect as the centre piece. The whole set up is executed perfectly, plus the characters are well rounded and really bring something unique or different to the table. It's also refreshing how dark and gruesome the film was willing to go, the death scenes were both hilarious and grisly which added to the dark comedy feel. It felt like it was always pushing itself further to see what it could get away with. Edgar Wright once again puts in the quick cuts that fit in well. On the whole Hot Fuzz is an extremely funny, well written and acted buddy cop send-up.",9,0,0,31 October 2013
Insomnia," No time for Sleeping
","Right from the opening credits the mood of quiet tension never lets up. The strong contrast between the icy landscape and blood leaking all over a material isn't there just to be a cool visual. We see our protagonist Will Dormer, a weary detective whose face looks burdened by the troubles that follow him. An insomniac, hunted by internal affairs for his suspect methods and now sent to investigate a murder in a remote town where the sun never sets. It's a question of how long before he snaps. Pacino is on top form in the type of role he's always excelled in. Tough and experienced after years in the job, but emotionally vulnerable and perpetually on the edge for exactly the same reason. His younger partner Eckhart is willing to dish out information on him. The turning point comes when a trap set for the killer goes wrong and Dormer kills Eckhart after mistaking him in the fog. There's no doubting that it was an accident, but Dormer knows that with the case against him he has no chance of making such a claim. He manages to just about suppress his guilt and concoct a story that lets him off clean. There's one major problem for him however, the killer knows that he did it.Insomnia isn't just a moody title, it's a reflection of Dormer's mind-set as a whole. How a man's mental state has become so damaged that his morality and ethics have become blurred. It questions how far he's willing to go to do what he knows is right deep down, even if it goes against the very principles he's lived by his entire life. The permanent daylight of Alaska serves to highlight his insomnia in a visual sense, bringing it to forefront so there's no place for him to hide. Too often films of this ilk try to add some kind of quirk or motif without giving it a reasoning or representation. But it's something that is handled impressively here.Bar Pacino, two performances really standout. The first being Hilary Swank as the plucky Ellie Burr, a role she plays to perfection. She never goes for the typical rookie cop trying to impress, she instead plays it audacious but collected, someone who wants to do the right thing but understands the difficulties that come with the job. The second is Robin Williams as the killer Finch. It never ceases to amaze me how someone so funny can reach such depths and play such disturbed characters. It's comparable to his part in 'One Hour Photo', released the same year. He takes an understated approach, making Finch more unnerving than raving and it works in give the role an edge.The relationship between Dormer and Finch actually turns out to be one of the highlights. We very rarely get a thriller that makes such a valid connection between the hero and villain. It is clear that the two of them share the same psychological problems. Insomnia haunts their every step. Notably their both trying to achieve the same thing, clearing their names. Finch wants to people to think he's innocent and Dormer wants to pin Eckhart's death on anyone but himself. Their relationship is fascinating for how manipulative it is. Both latch on to each other despite appearing to be polar opposites because they need to work together to survive. There are a couple of occasions where things can happen a little too conveniently or the plot ties together too neatly. Some of the action sequences feel a little out of place given the tone, though the chase across the logs is handled excellently. Nolan's reliance on the bigger picture can sometimes lead to the little details being forgotten about or hastily connected. However the story itself is a nice antidote to his previous film 'Memento'. While that film was chained so tightly to its gimmick that there was no room for anything to breathe or develop, Insomnia is much sparser and atmospheric. More interested in building tension through fog and isolation. It allows the characters to soak up the ghostly settings and for that to play into their psychology.Why the film drew Nolan's attention is obvious. It plays on themes that he finds interesting, mainly the troubled morality of the central character. Whereas most thrillers are interested in the details of the investigation and the crime, Insomnia makes a wise choice to instead examine the mind-set of Dormer and how he is distressed by his choices. The brightness proves a crucial aspect. Despite the murky underside of the case, the light is always on Dormer. He has nowhere to hide his feelings, even sleep has rejected him.",7,2,3,18 July 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," I wanted to like it, but the film falls off the map
","There are certain films that you really want to like because of anticipation and expectation, but the overall delivery leaves you feeling very disappointed. The third film in the Pirates of the Caribbean saga is one of those films for me. I think they tried too hard to change something that wasn't broken by trying to make the film into a colossal epic instead of letting it be an enjoyable swashbuckler.The story follows on from the last film as Will, Elizabeth and Barbossa sail to the edge of the world in order to save Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' locker. But the sinister Cutler Beckett has control of Jones' heart and with it he aims to control the seas as well as put an end to piracy. This leads to the nine pirate lords, Jack included, having to use the mysterious Calypso to make a stand against Beckett and Jones which leads to a lot of inner conflicts. That is just the outline of the plot, so as you can tell that is a lot going on and that is the stories biggest fault. Far too much is going on here. The story becomes needlessly complex to the point where you can't follow it and therefore you no longer care about what is going to happen. Plus the horribly bloated running time does nothing in the way of creating a more coherent narrative.As noted the main problem with the film is that it is excessive in every area and it is clear that the writers have forgotten what made the other two movies so entertaining. The film just feels really bloated, it is almost three hours long and boy does it feel it. Instead of using this time to develop the story, it just adds more into the already too complex mix and keeps on bringing more conflict that adds nothing to the film. By the middle of the film it is almost impossible to know how the characters are feeling or what they're motivations are.Even the characters are not as good as before. Johnny Depp is still amusing and enjoyable as Jack Sparrow, putting plenty of energy into the role and delivering some really funny lines. The problem is that there is a little too much Jack here. At times it is like the writers only really cared about Jack and therefore there are lots of scenes concentrating on him doing nothing in particular, such as when he is the locker. As I've said before Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom do nothing for me, sure they look the part but their acting is bland and not engaging enough. Geoffrey Rush makes a welcome return as the surly Barbossa and he gets a few good moments. Tom Hollander is still nicely slimy as Beckett and Bill Nighy carries on forming Jones into a complex character. Sadly Chow Yun-fat and Jack Davenport are wasted by being giving almost nothing to do, whilst the crew don't have as many comic moments to shine as they have before.The films attempts at changing tone also fall flat on its face. I mean the first two films had dark elements but they still had lots of fun and felt somewhat grounded, but At World's End tries to go way too dark or strange at times and it just feels misplaced. Being the film with a child being hung doesn't fit into this world at all. It just feels like the film is trying to copy of others by becoming this serious epic. As said it is too 'out there' for its own good sometimes. When there are multiple Jack's running around in the locker, all the stuff with crabs moving ships and a sea version of Jack licking a brain, what on earth is this? It's clear that the film is trying way too hard to be taken seriously, forgetting that the fun tone make the previous features.The jokes when used are tired too. There's only so many jokes that you can build around Rum before they become stale. The 'tension' is back between Jack and Elizabeth, the problem being that it has been done to death and is about as amusing as standing on a plug. The dialogue is no longer witty and well-paced, I can't really recall any funny lines presented here. Going back, the characters motivations are all over the place. Jack just seems to be here for the ride, Elizabeth is jumping between a dozen men and Will just wants to stab everyone in the back, there is no lead here that we can really get behind. The two most likable people were the villains from the first film, which kind of says it all.Was there anything good here? Well yes. The visuals are stunning at times, the locker especially looks amazing and the seas are as wonderfully vast as ever. But given this is the most expensive movie ever that is a given. Plus when the film stops its muddled plot, the action is fantastic. It has everything, great swordfights, intense sea battles and the climax itself looks incredible as well as having some really good action set-pieces. But these pieces cannot save the mess created, only make you wish the other parts were as good.So At World's End really comes across as a massive let-down. The story is so muddled that it is virtually impossible to follow and there are so many turns that by the end of the film I couldn't have cared less over what was going on. The film is certainly wasted potential, instead of concluding in true enjoyable style we are left with a muddled mess of a film, where even its positives are massively clouded by all the problems it has.",3,0,0,8 February 2014
Spider-Man 3," 2/3rd's Great, 1/3rd a Tonal Nightmare
","Spider-Man 3 would prove to be the final film in Sam Raimi's series despite plans for further films down the line. The film was one of the most expensive ever made at the time and there was high hope that it would continue to bring the success that the previous films had. It is well known that Raimi and the producers clashed, with the Venom aspects forced upon him due to fan popularity and it resulting in a host of characters vying for screen time. What we get is a strange turn of events. The film is cluttered in its writing and has a constantly wandering tone, but it's also the most enjoyable from a purely entertainment view and visually thrilling of the trilogy.Story: Peter has to balance both his lives out after a vengeful Harry suffers from amnesia and his relationship with Mary Jane begins to fall apart due to his commitments as Spider-Man. Alongside these issues Peter also has to deal with a criminal named Flint Marko linked to his uncles death who can manipulate sand, a photographer vying for his job and a mysterious symbiote that changes his personality. It's plain for everyone to see that there is way too much going on here. In a film just over two hours there has to be time for the relationship woes, Harry's personality, Sandman's development, Brock's development, the symbiote changing Peter, Aunt May, the Uncle Been revelation and even a slight romance with Gwen Stacy. For me the whole venom and symbiote aspects could have been dropped, mainly because there's not enough time to do them justice.Hero: Tobey Maguire is solid as Peter, he's so comfortable in the role by this point while he still brings a lot of charm and emotion to the character. However I don't think he handles the personality change that well, the stuff with 'emo Peter' is cringe-worthy and feels so forced.Villains: James Franco does a decent job as a more ruthless Harry, even though the characters motivations are muddled at times. Thomas Haden Church is excellent as Sandman despite his limited time. He adds real physicality having clearly bulked up and nails some really tender moments. Topher Grace is okay as Brock but suffers from a lack of development. The character is a little too annoying and forced in but Grace manages to get down the slimy aspects. Support: Kirsten Dunst continues to do a good job, yet Mary Jane is bordering on unlikeable at times. All she does is complain about Peter's responsibilities and it wears thin quickly. J. K. Simmons continues to steal every scene he's in and is as hilarious as ever here, his rapid delivery and sardonic attitude make him great fun to watch. Rosemary Harris is still a very warm and motherly Aunt May. Bryce Dallas Howard is good as Gwen and makes the character charming, it's just a shame she isn't featured more. A shout out to Bruce Campbell in his third and best cameo so far as a French head waiter.Action: The action in the film is spectacular. All of it contains dazzling effects and plenty of energy, making every blow or movement look fantastic. The first fights with Harry and Sandman are simply superb, both effortlessly thrilling thanks some excellent directing and flowing action. The climax at a construction site is one of the best set-pieces of the trilogy and makes for a brilliant final battle.Music: Christopher Young's score keeps a similar tone as the previous films and is very enjoyable. There's a lot of energetic pieces for the villains and fight scenes, but the mellower compositions really standout and add a touch of splendour to the film.Production: The films visuals are a highlight. It looks sleek and stylish in equal measure. Once again there are many shots that look like they came right out of a comic book and the vast city is captured perfectly. The CGI is superb and holds up well, most of the fight scenes incorporate it and it blends in without notice. The birth of the Sandman is simply beautiful. Just as with the previous two films, most of the issues come from the writing. As said there is far too much going on here for a start, but a lot of the character motivations are convoluted. An example being Mary Jane breaking up with Peter after Harry blackmails her, she knows he's Spider-Man so why doesn't she just tell him? The same goes for Harry being told the truth about his father's death, why wasn't that revealed to him sooner? Its things like that which hurt the film. With that said I do think the plot line of Sandman's sick daughter and his involvement with Uncle Ben's death is handled expertly. I also have to mention the tonal issues. The film constantly hops between pure fun, melancholy, funny and reflective, often in the same sequence. When you go straight from Peter's inner turmoil to him strutting down the street, it's just bizarre. The previous films did have tonal shifts, but never to this degree.Conclusion: When it's all said and done, I actually enjoy Spider-Man 3 despite all of its problems. I truly think the first 2/3rd's are very good and the tonal as well as the writing issues only really come into play in the final 1/3rd. It's probably the most enjoyable of the series in a basic sense. The issues arise because it's trying to cram too much in. Cut out most of the Venom related pieces and you actually have a lot of good material. I think both the Sandman and Harry stuff is great, and could have been even better with more time devoted to it. What we get is a film that is unbalanced and often muddled, but one that is still a visual and emotional feast that can still be enjoyed on a number of levels.",5,1,1,10 June 2016
The Prestige," Derailed by its own Prestige
","The Prestige opens and closes with Michael Caine's stage engineer Cutter informing us of the three acts behind every magic trick. The pledge: setting up something that seems ordinary (a bird), the turn: making that thing do something extraordinary (the bird disappears), and the prestige: restoring that thing to reality (the bird reappears). The final of the three, which is meant to be the hardest to achieve, is the key to the trick working. It's eerie then that the film collapses within the most crucial area. Its own prestige. Nolan's film is effectively a game of showmanship between two rival magicians. How when one performs a trick that seems impossible, the other drives himself to the edge in order to figure out its secret. The film isn't really about magic. It's more about the magic in creating the perfect illusion. Yet it goes on to deal with heavier themes. Most notably the dangers of obsession. How our lead Robert Angier is frequently told that his obsession with his rival Alfred Borden will lead to grave consequences, and it eventually does. It's themes of obsession, guilt and deceit are so well handled that the film could have been about anything. The fact that both men happen to be magicians just adds to the overall mystique.The trick itself is known as the 'Transported Man' and involves Borden entering a door on one side of the stage and emerging immediately from a door on the other side. Angier is convinced that a double is being used, despite Cutter claiming that it isn't possible, and sets up someone to look just like him. Of course the act is a success, until Borden sabotages it and leaves Angier even more determined to work out the secret. This is a fantastic pledge that the story has created. It leads to Angier travelling to snowy Colorado in order to find electricity genius Nikola Tesla (a fictionalised take on the man, played by David Bowie) who he believes can help him.Both lead characters are strangely underwritten. It's understandable why the stern Borden and more flamboyant Angier would become rivals (and that's even without the death of Angier's wife to provide some forced conflict), but we know barely anything about them as individuals. Take away their obsessions and there is little below the surface. We need deeper insight to know what makes these men tick and in order to understand why they are taking such massive risks. It relies on actors with big screen presences to make the roles appear interesting, something that Bale and Jackman just about manage to accomplish.What balances this out is its excellent directing, cinematography and pacing. Nolan's use of place and atmosphere has always been one of his strong points. He breathes life into his representation of early 1900's London and of the darkness that is consuming his leads. This is also one of the most clinical uses of a time shifting narrative I have seen, nothing seems awkwardly placed or moved. Nolan's prowess is what guides us through the pledge, but can he complete the cycle and deliver the ultimate prestige? Well, is it possible for the payoff to totally derail a film? Yes, and here is the perfect example. The film constantly tells us to look at the smaller details, to 'look closer', that understanding the illusion is everything and that the cleverest ruse is what ultimately matters. It spends the entire run time telling us that magic isn't real or of any importance. But Angier's master trick can only be explained by magic. The audience has basically been deceived, in entirely the wrong way, by this 'twist'. The Sci-Fi elements that enter the fore in order to make the payoff work clash with everything, mainly because the film has been so heavily based in realism and real trickery. So what is it telling us? That everything that it talked about was a lie? It somehow manages to ruin its own prestige with such a convoluted and nonsensical twist.The films climax is almost nothing but twists and turns. Scenes revealing that nothing was ever as it seems and deception was constantly taking place. I'm a big fan of films that have twists that leave you in awe or amazed. But the twist here is so left-field and against the very principal of the story that it ends up effectively derailing entire sections of the film, making sequences illogical in every aspect. It saddens me, because I was extremely impressed by the film on a technical level. The story was intriguing and it felt as if it was building to the most impressive payoff it could. Instead, we're left confused and irritated as the film simply throws the rule book out the window for its climax and decides its own fate.",4,2,4,19 July 2016
Megamind," Mega-Fun
","The comedic twist on the superhero genre is nothing new, nor is the take on seeing a super-villain in a new light as seen with Despicable Me. So the main question was could DreamWorks make an effective blend of the two with Megamind? I think they succeeded. It is nothing that other films of this type haven't touched upon before, but the smart script and fun characters really help make the film stand-out. It has plenty of laughs, it gets its references spot on and it has a surprising amount of dramatic moments.So what is the plot? Well a super-villain named Megamind has an ongoing battle against superhero Metro Man, constantly being defeated. One day Megamind actually manages to defeat his nemesis and take over the city, but quickly realises there is no fun if he has nobody to face and tries to create a new hero to do battle with. It's a relatively straight-forward plot, but what really makes the film work is its excellent characters. Along the way Megamind develops an attraction towards a reporter he usually kidnaps and the hero he chooses turns out to be not so ideal for the role. I was interested in the romance that developed, I enjoyed seeing Megamind train this new hero and I found that the interactions between the characters were always engaging.Megamind (an excellent Will Ferrell) has all you want in a main character. He finds being evil fun and it's hard to disagree with him at times, but you feel for him throughout and his transition into a more heroic character feels very natural. Roxanne (Tina Fey) is a fantastic female lead. Sure she is something of a damsel, but it is always played for laughs and she is just a well-balanced character. She's feisty and intelligent, but she's also gentle and vulnerable in a very human way. Minion (the always solid David Cross) is an enjoyable foil for Megamind and Metro Man (Brad Pitt) turns out to be a fun twist on the superhero. I found Hal Stewart (Jonah Hill) annoying and too goofy at first, but the more he grows into his superhero role the better he gets. The animation is fantastic as usual from DreamWorks and all the characters have interesting designs. There is just something about the way they animate that simulates motion and movement especially well. Whether it be for some slapstick or for the action scenes it just looks excellent every time. Something that impressed me was how well music was used in the film. The score by Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe is aptly heroic and upbeat, but it was also fantastically integrated with songs by the likes of Ozzy Osbourne, AC/DC and Guns N' Roses. Frequently this method falls flat or the songs date the film, but they are all used smartly and in suitable scenes when they appear.The comic references were very good. The similarities to Superman are done well and I especially enjoyed Megamind pretending to be Marlon Brando's Jor-El during the training scenes. The script and the dialogue really shine here, I was invested in Megamind's various dilemmas and I was intrigued as the how everything was going to pan out. I found the connection that developed between Megamind and Roxanne to be very believable, when I was initially worried that it would come off as forced. There are also some smart changes to the typical superhero formula, especially towards the end, that worked to the films advantage. It may be a touch predictable for some and I don't think it breaks any new ground, but I found Megamind to be really enjoyable. The plot is just different enough to be engaging, the animation is very impressive yet again and it's more serious moments are just as effective as its comedic ones. But I believe that it is the characters that give the film its biggest strength. Everything from the voice acting to the designs to the interactions they have just worked to near perfection. Megamind is definitely an entertaining take on the superhero/super-villain genre.",8,1,2,20 September 2015
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Brilliant dark musical from Burton & Depp
","Tim Burton recovered from something of an iffy spell in style with an adaptation of the musical of the same name. Before seeing the film the stylistic choices were rather unusual. Johnny Depp as the haunted Cockney barber, half of the dialogue being sung and using Burton's usual gloomy visuals all seemed strange choices. As a non-musical fan I was also worried that the film might be a bit over-bearing on that front. Thankfully all my worries were dissolved from the beginning as Burton crafts possibly his most satisfying film to date, certainly since his earlier work, thanks to a great number of inspiring features.The plot sees barber Sweeney Todd return to London after being exiled for a crime he did not commit with intentions of gaining revenge on the Judge who wronged him. Todd sets up his barbers above Mrs. Lovett's pie shop and he begins killing off unsuspecting customers for her to put into pies. After he discovers that the Judge also has custody of his daughter, Todd will stop at nothing to get the Judge into his chair. The story is a really interesting one dealing with themes like revenge and moral corruption in a gripping way. I like how the film flowed well and moved along at a decent pace, but still took the time to develop the characters and let you know the reasons behind their actions. It was extremely engaging because it really made me care about Todd's plight and I was interested in where the story was going to go.But what about the main piece itself which is the music. I'll go out and say that all the music in the film is absolutely fantastic. There was not one bit of music that I didn't thoroughly enjoy and amazing all of these songs fit into the film perfectly. From the bouncy 'By the Sea' to the beautiful 'Johanna' to the serene 'Pretty Women' to the raw aggression of 'Epiphany', all of these songs where wonderfully composed and the different tones mesh well together in the grand scheme of things. The singing was also really impressive. Johnny Depp hasn't the best voice but for the pure emotion he puts into the songs it is impossible to fault him, while the distinct voices of Rickman and Bonham Carter fit really well.The acting is also superb, especially when you consider all the things the actors have to do. Johnny Depp does a splendid job of conveying the restrained rage and sadness that encapsulates Todd. Depp's understated turn gives the role added powerful and tinges of emotion that fit very well. He also does a rather good Cockney accent and, as said, his singing voice is quite impressive. Helena Bonham Carter is brilliant as usual as the opportunist Mrs. Lovett. It's a role that would be easy to dislike, but Bonham Carter adds such a down to earth tone and seemingly caring outlook that it always keeps your sympathy. Alan Rickman is simply a joy to watch as the crooked Judge perfectly showing off his seedy nature and Timothy Spall is wonderful as the horribly slimy Beadle, both creating unpleasant villains. Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener were effective, while young Ed Sanders does a great job as Toby and his singing is also rather good. Sasha Baron Cohen is also very convincing in a more serious role.The visuals truly are striking. Burton brings his melancholy palette wonderfully to the film, giving London a twisted beauty. The shady colours worked really well in creating a contrast to all the blood that the film lays out. Even the flashback scenes and those imaginary ones are beautifully lit which also corresponds the misery of their lives very well. Adding to the look all the other visual aspects are perfectly done. The costumes look very authentic and capture the period well. The make-up is fantastic, especially on Depp. The sets are also superbly designed which gives the film a much more intimate atmosphere than you'd expect. There is just something about the cinematography that really makes the film leap out at you.The gory parts are rather gruesome, but I don't think the film would have as much impact if they were toned down and it does have an important part to play in telling this story. There is no backing down on that front and at times it does become enjoyably over-the-top without becoming silly. The more humour moments are well placed. There is some really good understated humour especially from Bonham Carter that fits well and Ed Sanders gets a few funny lines as well. The contest between Todd and Pirelli is a lot of fun, while the 'By the Sea' dream sequence is very amusing simply for how cheerful it is against everything else. For me the ending was quite surprising just for how it didn't fall into the usual formula and gave a satisfying but oddly bittersweet conclusion to everything.Overall I really love Sweeney Todd. It is amazing just how good these songs are, the way they're all composed, sung and fit into the film really is something to be impressed by, I mean they're so good that you can happily listen to them separately. Johnny Depp delivers a powerful lead turn as well as some excellent singing, the rest of the cast are simply brilliant and the visuals are really stunning to behold. The film is effortlessly entertaining, the story on its own makes for a really strong set-up to events. Sweeney Todd certainly had me gripped throughout and showed that when Burton & Depp are on top from then they are very hard to beat.",8,2,2,8 February 2014
"Monsters, Inc."," Excellent in nearly every way
","The premise behind Monsters, Inc. isn't something that we haven't seen before, but it is one that allows for a lot of creativity and one that the film takes full advantage of. Pixar was still in a relatively early stage when the film came out, yet it was the perfect way to show that their imagination knew no bounds. It centres on two monsters at a company whose job it is to scare children because the monster world is powered by the screams of children. Now that is a really inventive idea. But their world is thrown into disarray when a child called Boo gets out (with monsters believing children are toxic) and our two heroes have to get her back, all while not being found out and uncovering a wider conspiracy. This leads to a story packed full of twists and turns, plenty of comedy and action set pieces, and a surprising emotional heft.The story itself allows for a vast amount of creativity with the concept of monsters having this kind of job, all the unique designs and the fact that they are terrified of children. It is also great how detailed the story is, because you simply never know where it's going or how it's going to end up and its constantly gripping as a result of that. The two leads are vital to the story and thankfully they are both great. Sulley is the company's top scarer, yet on the inside he's just a big teddy bear and there is something so endearing about him. He's a really warm screen presence and seeing his relationship with Boo grow throughout the film is strangely beautiful. Mike is much more of a wise-cracker and somewhat neurotic, which actually makes him a great contrast to Sulley. He does provide a lot of laughs and the friendship with Sulley feels very genuine. In fact both John Goodman and Billy Crystal deserve praise for giving such excellent performances.It's also impressive how well Boo is handled. Usually very young children can be annoying or plain boring, but she is the right balance of curious and gentle whilst still having enough funny moments. The fact that she speaks in a muddled sort of baby talk is another positive and actually makes her more endearing. Most notable is her relationship with Sulley, as it is build up just perfectly and their final moments together are incredibly touching. That emotional core between is a real strong point of the film. The films comedic moments are very well done too. Mike relies much more on his witticisms and anxious behaviour to get laughs which works surprisingly well, while the other monsters ineptitude when it comes to scaring also provides a great number of amusing moments.With that said one of the films few weaknesses are its villains. They're not bad, just a little one-dimensional and underdeveloped. Randall is a typically snide and aggressive rival, we don't learn anything about him and he doesn't really do much but try to hunt down Boo. He either needed to be funnier or more threatening to leave an impression. Waternoose also turns out to be involved in the plot despite his initial loyalty to Sulley, his conflict does make sense yet he is also a little underused. Despite that he does have a good design and James Coburn does a good job vocal. That said their actions do lead to a spectacular climax. It basically has Sulley and Mike frantically searching for Boo's door in what is effectively a gigantic room of doors. It's fun, it's exciting, it's tense, it is exactly the type of big climax you'd want the film to have. The animation is excellent once again. The fact that its set in a world of monsters allows for some really interesting and colourful designs, the majority of monsters look unique and are memorable as a result of that. Just looking at Sulley, the amount of detail put in with all his hairs is so impressive. We don't see too much of the monster world, but the factory is an interesting setting and still permits plenty of creativity. The side characters are a bit hit-and- miss, although the Abominable Snowman (Pixar regular John Ratzenberger) gets some really good lines and the cranky receptionist Roz is enjoyable. Randy Newman's score has an effective light, jazzy feel to it and it is brilliant. Not only does it suit the tone of the film, but it also adds a nice energy to the more action packed scenes and provides some wonderfully emotive melodies.So on the whole Monsters, Inc. is another big success for Pixar. I think that it works so because it gets the key areas right. The premise is interesting, the two leads are a great pairing, the main conflict is gripping and there is a strong emotional centre to the film that makes it even stronger. It is easy to care about these characters and want to see them succeed. I do think the villains are a bit weak and maybe the conspiracy is a little unneeded, but neither does too much damage to the overall product and that is because its central focus is so good. Added to that the animation, score and comedy all work fantastically to the best effect. It's a film that is funny, moving and engaging in all the right ways.",7,1,2,22 January 2016
Captain America: The First Avenger," Marvel's middle of the road film
","With the success of Iron Man it made sense that another Marvel heavyweight in Captain America should come to the big screen and the result is a flawed but decent enough old school action piece. Joe Johnston had shown ability to handle highly stylised films in the past and Chris Evans had experience in the comic book field with the underwhelming Fantastic Four films. What we end up getting is a film that manages to put its pulp roots to good use and makes the well- worn underdog story work okay because of how it uses the basic elements. It definitely stutters throughout, but it's a nice to have another comic book film that knows how to provide plenty of adventure.Story: Set during WW2, a frail man named Steve Rogers continually fails to make the army grade until he is given the chance via a serum that enhances all of his abilities. Now involved as the patriot hero Captain America, he goes after a Nazi organisation named Hydra which is headed by Johann Schmidt who has used the same serum as Rogers. The plot is relatively straight-forward as we see Rogers grow from a plucky underdog to the defender of America and even the villains plan is simply to cause havoc with advanced weaponry. The issue is that this is a story that has been so many times that it is entirely predictable and though the film does it well, it doesn't do it exceptionally well and doesn't really add anything new onto the formula.Hero: Chris Evans does a surprisingly fantastic job as the titular hero and is probably the best thing here. He perfectly portrays Rogers as upbeat and courageous, but with a kind innocence in that he just wants to help out. It's a character that is easy to get behind and care about, while Evans also convinces in the suit and handles all areas of the character effectively despite his lack of an arc.Villains: Hugo Weaving does a convincing job as the devious Schmidt, but is let down by no character development. Weaving makes you believe the guy is evil and his expressions alone are great, yet we learn next to nothing about his past or true intentions and his grand scheme is overly convoluted. He simply becomes a very boring obstacle as the film goes on. The Nazi soldiers are pretty much black Stormtroopers and Toby Jones gets little to do as Schmidt's biochemist.Support: Hayley Atwell is very good despite her lack of development as Peggy Carter. She manages to get across the characters sweet demeanour, handles the dramatic moments well and she has excellent chemistry with Evans, but she certainly deserved more time devoted to her. Tommy Lee Jones did what he does best as the sardonic and grouchy colonel, whilst managing to get a few laughs throughout. Dominic Cooper cut a suave and effectively dashing figure as Howard Stark. Stanley Tucci is good fun as the German scientist who recruits Rogers and provides some good laughs, it's a shame he isn't involved for long. Sebastian Stan is just okay as Rogers' best friend. Action: The action scenes are done more in a classic sense. There are plenty of large scale army battles and mass gun fights to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Captain America himself has an impressive fighting style and we get to see him do many things that only humans can dream of, though he does manage to avoid injury a few too many times. The final confrontation with Schmidt is a bit of a let-down and doesn't have the intensity that was needed, but the climax is satisfying enough.Music: Alan Silvestri provides a very forgettable score. I honestly cannot remember any compositions that stood out, the music doesn't build up the fight scenes and the main theme itself is totally unmemorable. It just feels like a typical run of the mill action score and has none of the required bombast for such a film.Production: Visually the film is something of a mixed bag. Johnston shoots the action well enough and there is an atmosphere to certain scenes that works. Everything seems highly stylised during the 1940's and that does lend a comic book feel to proceedings, but then things like the advanced technology are never explained properly even if it will later tie into some of the other Marvel films. The costumes and sets were all very good in making you believe that it was a different era. Yet it does suffer badly from some really blurry frames and some downright weird editing, there were some scenes that literally cut away out of nowhere which was very jarring. This leads to another big issue, the CGI. This film has some truly awful CGI and it just completely takes you out of what is taking place on screen when it pops up. As a result many of the large scale sequences or action pieces just didn't have any weight behind them.Conclusion: So Captain America is an enjoyable adventure yarn, but it is a very flawed film and is just downright dull in certain areas. It has its moments with some impressive spectacle, a solid cast and Chris Evans is impressive as the Captain. However it is weak in too many areas to be thought too highly of as it has an overdone storyline, a bland villain, ropey CGI and some off-putting direction. Many of the elements where in place here for something great and though some of them pay off, many of them fall flat. As far as the Marvel films are concerned this is slap bang in the middle, it's a film which is easy to enjoy but equally as easy to forget.",4,2,3,21 November 2015
American Hustle," Glitz and Glamour
","American Hustle saw acclaimed director David O. Russell gather a group of actors he'd previously worked with and attempt a looser take on a con/sting movie. Very loosely based on the real life Abscam operation, the film tries to have fun with the characters it crafts and place them with in an elaborate setting with the hope that sparks will fly. Russell's films regularly drift between being mildly serious and darkly comedic with American Hustle being no different. Even though the film does benefit from its visual prowess and attention to detail, it frequently leans into an area where it is too offbeat and sprawling for its own good where characters become less defined as the film struggles to build on its narrative. Straight out the blocks the film has major issues with its plotting. Apparently there was a great deal of improvisation and the storyline was tailored to fit that as things progressed, and you can tell. The whole film revolves around a sting involving two con artists, the FBI and a local mayor which is pretty thin for this genre of film. Yet there is a lot of stuff about Arabic investment where a fake Arab Sheikh is used and how corrupt casino owners from out of town are trying to get involved. It all gets muddled and confusing very quickly, with the film doing little to explain what is actually happening. The characters motivations seem misguided as more is added to concoction and by the climax it's hard to tell what anyone actually wants, which I assume is linked to the improvisation.On to the acting itself and it's a mixed bag. Christian Bale is clearly channelling De Niro and for the most part he does a good job, making what is a sleazy and uncertain character engaging. His physical transformation deserves credit too. Jeremy Renner was very impressive, creating a mayor that was warm and charismatic despite his dark underside. Jennifer Lawrence simply provides an okay performance as Bale's mouthy wife, though she certainly looked way too young for the role. Two big blotches are Adams and Cooper. Adams is just an extraordinarily bland actress and its more of the same here, her blank expression never changes throughout and she has no chemistry with either male lead. Cooper can't do serious acting. Any time he has to show emotion he ends up yelling and there are many moments where he goes unnecessarily over-the-top that drags you out of the film.From a visual and production standpoint it's hard to fault the film. Its style and glamour are definitely one of its strong points, with colours leaping off the screen and many of the sets looking especially beautiful. It certainly captured the essence of the late 70's time period, but managed to add a spark to it all. Russell's directing is hard to fault too and he knows how to create a stimulating shot simply by the positioning of the camera. The costumes and make-up are terrific, particularly on Bale, by providing a nice legitimacy to the story playing out. The use of music of the time can often hurt a film, but the soundtrack was smartly picked and many of the tracks used complimented what was taking place on screen. On the writing side I certainly think the film suffered. The lack of cohesion does the film no favours and at times I think the film gets so dialogue-heavy that things get cluttered. There was also a distinct lack of laughs despite the film being partially labelled as a comedy. There was plenty of potential for some really funny moments or dark comedy to creep yet it's like the film was holding back on the laughs in an attempt to retain the already faulty legitimacy. The dreaded issue of boredom also rears its head at times, which is disappointing given how stylised the film is trying to look. There's a lot taking place on screen and often the dialogue will keep on coming without a pause for thought, but certain scenes don't go anywhere in particular and listening to these characters ramble on can get difficult. So while I do admire American Hustle from a production stance and for its elegance, I think it failed to deliver on its potential. It is undoubtedly a messy film which isn't a surprise given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the claimed improvisations. Worse than being messy, I think the film gets dangerously close to being boring a number of times which is never a good sign. Despite good performances by Bale and Renner, both Adams and Cooper are black holes of charisma which makes it hard to get involved in the characters' struggles. Despite Russell's intentions, the film needed to be clearer about being a more serious or more comedic and much more structure in its storyline. Instead, what we end up with is a film that looks great and can entertain, but struggles all too frequently.",3,4,5,4 May 2016
The Godfather: Part II," The greatest sequel ever made and equally as good as the original
","It seems impossible to think that the first Godfather could be topped, but its direct sequel may be even better. It effectively takes all the elements from the first and makes them bigger and more complex, as well as revolutionising the idea of flashbacks. The plot is possibly the greatest of all time, the characters are more diversely fascinating and everything feels even more epic than before.The plot is split in two, one following the Corleone family in modern day and the other early life of Vito. The first follows Michael who is now Don as he attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas. He faces much dissatisfaction in his own family, from Capo Frank Pentangeli and his own sister. He later survives an assassination attempt, and as he tries to learn who made the attempt he also faces a committee investigation that tears his family apart. This story is one of the best in film history, everything about it is incredibly set-up. The second charts the young life of Vito Corleone as he raises his family in New York and aims to build his own legacy. This sees him challenge the local Don and gain friends to help him achieve his goal. This part gives us a true insight into how all of what we're seeing started and is a fantastic mirror image to the modern events. The huge cast is once again truly outstanding. Al Pacino gives an incredible performance as we see Michael transform into a cold monster who has no feelings for his family. The way Pacino shows the struggle as he edges closer to the abyss is astonishing. The other star is John Cazale as Fredo, he is outstanding as the timid Fredo, the chemistry between himself and Pacino sets their scenes alight. Robert Duvall is solid as a rock once again as the reserved Tom, while Diane Keaton is great showing Kay as confused and frightened of her situation. Michael V. Gazzo is superb as Frank showing him as a genuinely troubled person. Richard Bright deserves praise as, despite few lines, he commands the screen as the loyal but brutal Al Neri. Joe Spinell is great as the doubtful Cicci as is Lee Strasberg as the devious Hyman Roth. Robert De Niro made his name here, he plays Vito with assured comfort and is just as good as Brando, which is praise itself. The film looks stunning. It is lit similar to the first and carries the same gloomily authentic feel being very atmospheric. The scenes of early New York and of Sicily are both excellent having a very natural look to them. The music from Nino Rota is once again marvellous. The script is full of classic lines, 'Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer' and 'I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies' to name but two. It's great how the film focuses more on Michael and it's reflected by the look at Vito. Michael grows increasingly paranoid and unstable as he places the family business above all else. We see the differences in how the family is set. Vito's was built on loyalty and love, whereas Michael's family is built on fear and violence. It is a fascinating contrast which the film itself is built on, the whole scope is formed from this showing the pleasant start of the family and then it's tragic fall. There are so many classic scenes, Michael finding out the traitor, Kay's pregnancy reveal, all of the conversations with Fredo, the scenes at the hearing and the famous 'fishing trip' to name a few. The final shot of Michael sitting alone is one of the most memorable of all time.The Godfather Part II is a breath taking achievement in film and has possibly the greatest story ever put on screen.",10,4,6,29 October 2013
The Bourne Identity," Excellent spy thriller
","The Bourne Identity is the first film in the hit spy trilogy starring Matt Damon as an apparent ex CIA assassin. It comes off as a slick and smart film, avoiding the usual action clichés and having very intelligent ideas that work. The film is high octane stuff mainly thanks to the interesting premise, excellent performances and superb action set pieces.The plot sees fishermen recover a man's body out at sea with two bullet holes in his back. He is suffering from amnesia and doesn't remember who he was, later discovering his name to be Jason Bourne. A laser device planted in his hip shows him his bank account which is full of money and a gun. Bourne then finds himself hunted by the police and, with the help of a woman named Marie, he searches for answers in Paris which lead all the way to the CIA. The story flows extremely well and has a lot of twists that help in making things more interesting. The general story about Bourne is just an interesting one and you can never really tell where the film is going to end up, which makes it all the more gripping.The cast is exceptional. Matt Damon is excellent as Bourne, perfectly portraying him as confused and conflicted but still very clever. He does a great job of handling the action, intense and emotional scenes with astuteness. Franka Potente is equally good as Marie. She comes off as likable and her normality gives her a realistic edge, she makes for a sensitive and courageous companion for Bourne. Chris Cooper does an incredibly solid job as the CIA man who is tracking Bourne's every move. He shows him as a cold calculating figure without removing all of his humanity. Brian Cox is great as always as the intense Abbott, Cox's sheer presence shows intellect and cunning. Julia Stiles is very good as informer Nicky. Clive Owen is very good too as the stoic assassin the 'Professor'.The action scenes are brilliant. The fights scenes are a lot more realistic than most films, which makes them fast, exciting and surprisingly brutal. The fight with the would-be assassin and the climax in particular are excellently shot. The car chase is a highlight, it just feels naturally gritty while still being a thrilling and entertaining set piece. The characters are well fleshed out which is something most action films miss out on. Bourne is an interesting person and as he finds out more so do the audience, he eventually does feel like a real spy and thanks to Damon's intense portrayal he does appear to be fighting for his life. The same goes for the realism as the characters do come across as somewhat vulnerable. The film itself is shot really well, it captures Paris very beautifully and espionage atmosphere is nicely heavy. Its surprising how well paced it is, it seemingly moves quickly but still has time to add hints of melancholy and emotion to the story itself. It is a brilliant style of relying on story and characters with bursts of action and energy, which harken back to older action films. The score by John Powell is great as it is both nicely moody and rather exhilarating when it needs to be. The Bourne Identity is tense, thrilling and emotive in equal doses as its one of the finest spy films around.",8,3,3,29 October 2013
Man of Steel," Can be Summed up in a Word: Bland!
","After the all-round disappointment of Superman Returns, it was decided that a reboot was the best way to go for the iconic superhero following the success of the Dark Knight trilogy. Director Zack Snyder was brought on board, best known for his adaptions of the comics 300 and Watchmen (the former being overwhelmingly style over substance and the latter surprisingly good if uneven). Added to that the cast featured many excellent actors who could bring weight to their roles. However, for all the films potential it is just as dull and uninteresting as Superman Returns was despite its greatest efforts to avoid any comparison. Story: A baby named Kal-El is sent to Earth from the planet Krypton just before it is destroyed. He grows up as Clark Kent and quickly learns that he is not part of the human race. But a general from Krypton comes to conquer Earth and Clark is the only person who can stop him. The general plot line is fine but it is told in such a messy manner that it pretty much ruins the film on its own. The entire set-up can be summed up as rushed. We see fragments of Clark's life as a teenager but learn next to nothing about his predicament or his relationship with his adopted parents, why should care about anything when these characters are as one-dimensional as it gets? Clark actually becoming Superman comes out of nowhere because there's none of the build-up needed, no questions are asked and there's no curiosity to what he really is. Once Zod arrives the film descends into scenes solely containing clunky dialogue and hectic headache-inducing action scenes.Hero: Superman is painfully dull and that is because he has no personality. He isn't intelligent, witty, charming, tough or reflective. This 'Superman' has none of the traits or complexities needed for the character to work, there isn't a second within the film where we get inside the characters head. He just walks around with the blank expression of a confused puppy or smashes other extra-terrestrials through large buildings. Adding to the poor character writing is Henry Cavill who is as wooden as a shed and I don't find anything he says remotely believable because of that.Villains: Michael Shannon is usually great screen presence, but he is playing a truly terrible character here. They don't even try to give dimensions to Zod or make us see his dilemma, he's just a raging lunatic from the get go. Sadly that isn't remotely interesting. Shannon doesn't help matters as he goes for the insane bug-eyed look throughout, delivers most of the dialogue like he's chewing on marbles and most of his over-the-top rambling are just hilarious for all the wrong reasons.Support: Amy Adams' Lois Lane is just as dull as Superman is. Adams is just a boring actress (and I think there were much better candidates for the role) and Lois herself is never defined as a character. She isn't the no-nonsense, charismatic reporter most people think of because even though she acts all tough she has to constantly be bailed out of situations and she's a charisma vacuum. Elsewhere Kevin Costner and Diane Lane bring respectability to the Kent's, while Russell Crowe does a solid job as Jor-El.Action: The action scenes are made up of people being slammed through buildings or getting launched hundreds of feet. They are truly terrible. You know none of this will harm Superman or Zod unless they literally kill each other so it makes it all pointless. The climax goes on for what feels like an eternity (I feel like I had a birthday watching it), taking up the entire last third and it is just overkill on another level. From a technical standpoint they're filmed horribly and edited to within an inch of their life, meaning it's extremely difficult to tell what's happening half the time.Music: Hans Zimmer's score is one of the most forgettable superhero scores of all time. I seriously cannot recall what the main theme sounded like, it was that bland. He provides the usual big trumpet sound, but nothing we haven't heard him do before and it's not remotely memorable.Production: Visually the film is not very impressive. It's not as notably stylish as Snyder's previous efforts and although the Watchman style wouldn't suit the film, it would at least make what we're seeing look exciting. The film just has an overly drab colour scheme and would be best described as gloomy. None of the colours standout or pop, none of the locations look anything special and the film has a surprisingly low-budget look to it. As mentioned the editing is a complete mess, with the action scenes looking like they were edited by a maniac and certain scenes playing out like they were racing to the finish line to get them over with. The script and writing is by far the biggest issue however. Everything about the plot and characters feels either rushed, incomplete or as if it was written by a child. The film literally leaps from one scene to the next whilst never explaining anything and increasingly piles on the mindless action when it seems at a loss for what to do next.Conclusion: For me Man of Steel is a massive disaster. For all Superman Returns' faults it had its heart in the right place, whereas this film seems clueless from the get and the fact people have given it so much acclaim baffles me beyond belief. It's literally half a film of boring scenes with no motivation, then another half of endless dumb action scenes. It's impossible to care about where the film is going or what the outcome will be when the key elements are such a complete mess. As a result Man of Steel becomes overly depressing and too action- heavy, which simply doesn't work for the character and sucks any out any possible enjoyment.",2,10,17,22 March 2016
Kung Fu Panda 2," Kung Fu Panda has its Empire Strikes Back
","Kung Fu Panda 2 is pretty much everything a sequel should be. It builds upon its characters, it crafts a plot that is larger as well as more personal and its themes are even deeper than before. It sees Po (Jack Black), who has now been fully accepted by the furious five, forced to battle against a peacock named Lord Shen who plans to conqueror China with a new weapon. It doesn't seem like much on the surface, but Po begins to have flashbacks of why his parents abandoned him and it links directly back to Shen himself. Stories like this are brilliant because the set-up and main goal is relatively simple, but there is a very heartfelt and surprisingly emotion core to the film that is just fantastic.This feels like its Po's story, and it might annoy some people that the other characters aren't developed more, but for me it was the right move. It makes you always engaged in the journey that he goes through, you want to know what happened to his real parents and he grows as a hero as a result of everything that he goes through. Po himself is again a lot of fun and it impresses me how well balanced the character is, being naive but lovable at the same time with Jack Black adding his usual drive to the role. The furious five are still are really enjoyable team and I think the writers did a great job in giving them all the right amount of lines as well as making them a team you can connect to. Master Shifu has a more limited appearance, but he's still good fun when he shows up. Arguably the best thing is Lord Shen (Gary Oldman). This is a villain who is both intimidating and really funny, and so many times it's either too much of one or the other yet here they get it spot- on. He is never too serious and he is never too goofy, it is a perfect balance. He has a backstory that explains his actions and connects to Po's spiritual journey. The animation on him looks marvellous and Oldman is absolutely brilliant as usual.I think one of the main reasons the film works so well is because of the emotion impact it has. The characters all have legitimate reasons for what they are doing and they're feelings as well as flaws are shown fully. The scenes with Po and his adoptive father Mr. Ping (James Wong) are really touching as well as being amusing. The flashbacks are truly moving and even tear inducing. I believe it shows that you can be serious and even somewhat sombre if you can get the balance right. The jokes are consistently funny here, mostly due to Po's behaviour and a lot of Shen's lines. Once again with DreamWorks the animation is absolutely superb with this being some of their sharpest and most vibrant that they have ever produced. Pretty much everything from character designs to the scenic shots of ancient China look fantastic. The more 2-D style in Po's flashbacks is also a nice touch and helps it standout. The speed of the animation is another plus. When it is used for slapstick the quick pace makes everything seem even funnier, and it does a similar thing for the action scenes by giving them even more energy. The score (by Hans Zimmer and John Powell) is another positive, crafting the right amount of soothing melodies and backing the action effectively with some more upbeat compositions.I think balance is the key word here and it is where Kung Fu Panda 2 succeeds. The story itself is an excellent continuation and the way it unravels as the film goes on is just wonderful. It has plenty of comedy and well placed humour, but it never shies away from darker and more emotional material. I found myself both moved and laughing in equal measure. As said I think the main characters are all great, the animation is spectacular and the villain is outstanding. It is exactly what you want in a sequel and I can't wait to see where the series goes next.",8,6,6,22 September 2015
North by Northwest," A Personal Favourite
","North by Northwest is a personal favourite of mine. It is Hitchcock's most light and purely entertaining film, a smart change of pace after the darkly psychological 'Vertigo'. It takes his signature wrong man storyline and simply sees how much fun it can have with the idea. It makes the characters as charming as possible, the action grander than ever before, the locations exotic and the situations as exciting as you could want them to be. It's a film that succeeds in its aim magnificently, give the audience a thrilling adventure. It revolves around suave advertising executive Roger Thornhill who is kidnapped after being mistaken for 'George Kaplan' and interrogated before almost being killed by the shady Vandamm. Nobody believes Thornhill's story so he sets out to find Kaplan himself. However he has to go on the run when he's framed for murder, which draws him into a world of deceit, spies and simply trying to stay alive. This story is not only brilliantly entertaining, but it twists and turns all the time. You don't know who Thornhill can trust or what's waiting around the corner for him, making him a vulnerable hero. A good example being when he meets Eve Kendell, we don't know whether she's a kind stranger, a spy herself or working with the enemy. It is great at keeping you guessing like that. What always impresses me about the film is how it blends genres so easily. It is a thrilling adventure at heart of course. Yet there are smatterings of mystery, action, romance and comedy throughout. It leaps between all of these without any feeling out of place and without losing sight of the plot. Most of the characters actions drive the narrative forward in that sense, what we initially think is only loosely connected may end having a larger bearing. Almost everything that happens on screen has leads to something else. In fact the humour in the film is something that really stands out. The situations are dangerous yet they can also be wonderfully absurd and the film finds genuine laughs with the idea of a normal person being forced to risk his life in such a way.The performances are great all round. Cary Grant is delivers one of the most stylish performances of all time as Thornhill. He makes the character so debonair and charming, seemingly unfazed by the deadly situations he finds himself in, with a sharp wit and wisecracks at the ready. He's clearly enjoying himself and is a magnetic screen presence. Eva Marie Saint is effortlessly appealing as Kendell, probably the most humane of Hitchcock's icy blondes. James Mason is just wonderful as Vandamm. He's the perfect villain. Subtle, mysterious, cunning, strangely charismatic, all with a smooth voice and expressive features. The notable supporting performances come from Martin Landau as creepy heavy Leonard and Jessie Royce Landis as Thornhill's sardonic mother. The film is filled with memorable sequences and imagery. The romantic playfulness of the scenes aboard the train. The brilliant scene where Thornhill deliberately sabotages an auction. The truly spectacular climax that takes place atop Mount Rushmore. One of my favourite sequences in all of film is when Thornhill waits for 'Kaplan' on a stretch of road in the middle of nowhere. The way Hitchcock manages to build a sense of tension and isolation is simply masterfully. It also leads to the noteworthy crop duster sequence. This is how you do action. It might not seem like much, but we really do feel as if Thornhill's life is at risk and that gives it so much more impact than any fancy effects or choreography could.Hitchcock's direction is as good as ever. The camera-work is very fluid here, it moves gently around the screen at times, almost as if it's surveying the area. His staging of the action sequences and moments of important dialogue help immensely in giving the scenes the weight they need. This is also a handsome looking film. Everything from The hotel interiors to the train carriages to the UN building looks fantastic and is lit well. Ernest Lehman wrote the screenplay and it is a brilliant one, full of witty dialogue that roles off the tongue exquisitely. Apparently he was attempting to write the ultimate Hitchcock thriller, I think it's fair to say that he succeeded in doing so. Bernard Herrmann's dynamic score, and its wonderful main theme, is just the icing on the cake. In many ways North by Northwest is like the prototype Bond film, except it's unrestrained by any formula and contains Hitchcock's trademark thrills. We have a dashing main character, the beautiful female for him to latch on to, a diabolical but charming villain, a surging plot and visually interesting locations. Of course the difference maker is Hitchcock himself. He has a plot and script that allow him to do what he does best to the most unrestricted level he's ever done. The thrills, the suspense, the action, the excitement, not to mention the subtle comedy and romance. It's all here and it's even grander than before. This is Hitchcock's exercise in escapist fun. It gives us pure thrills without any pretensions and I wouldn't change a thing about it.",10,2,4,14 July 2016
Spider-Man," Spider Sense is Tingling
","A live action Spider-Man had been in the works for some time before comic-book fan and cult favourite Sam Raimi's film hit the big screen. The most notable was James Cameron's scriptment, whilst the likes of David Fincher and Tony Scott were considered for the job. Raimi got the gig, directing a film that works as both an origin story and as a fun action flick. It's clear that he has a love for the source material and that he understands the larger than life aspects of the comic world. What we get is good fun with some big limitations. The films heart is in the right place and it's full of emotion, yet the writing is frequently sloppy and it does descend into campiness a little too much.Story: Nerdy teenager Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider and develops spider-like abilities. He decides to use these powers to fight crime as Spider-Man once his uncle is killed. He is forced to confront businessman Norman Osborn whose evil alter ego is taking revenge on those who turned on him. The origin story is fairly simplistic, but I enjoy the messages it gets across. The 'great responsibility' stuff might be corny but it really works because the connection between Peter and his family feels genuine, whilst Peter developing and testing his new power is handled with care. Even though Peter's relationship with Mary Jane leads to some convolution I think it is handled well here. The Goblin plot is only where things go astray and that is mostly down to unclear writing.Hero: Tobey Maguire puts in a strong performance as Peter. What impresses is that he manages to capture the characters awkwardness whilst retaining an honest likability. His actions and motivations seem very natural. His Spider-Man isn't as witty or wisecracking as many want him to be, but I don't think that's much of an issue here. Villain: Willem Dafoe as Osborn proves to be extremely hit-and-miss. When Dafoe concentrates on the characters unease and the conflict within he is excellent, carrying a real sense of menace. The Goblin is just a hammy mess for the most part. Partly because the characters feelings and motivations are completely unfocused, partly because of some absolutely horrid dialogue and delivery. Support: Kirsten Dunst is good as M.J. She does have the girl next door vibe, while her motivations are clear and her relationship with Peter is built up with authenticity. I just don't like the way she is always a damsel and effectively becomes a plot device for Spider- Man to save. James Franco does a solid job as Peter's best friend and Norman's son Harry. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson bring a welcomed sincerity to May and Ben. A real standout is J. K. Simmons as Jameson in what is some of the best casting ever seen. He nails the role by being a wonderful mixture of deadpan, sardonic and arrogant.Action: The action is certainly a mixed bag. While sequences like the wrestling match and the montage of Spider-Man's activity are great fun, the main pieces are a bit of a let-down. The parade fight is harmed by some woeful CGI which makes the city look like cardboard. The climax is a cool set-up, but lacks any real heft and it ends up being a bland punching match. That said, the scene in the flaming building is brilliant and features some really impressive effects.Music: Danny Elfman provides a surprisingly effective score. It's much bouncier and more bombastic than his usual work, fitting the film extremely well and giving a real sense of excitement to the images of Spider-Man swinging through the city. His main theme is also very memorable.Production: I find Sam Raimi's direction to be a lot of fun. He always appears to know what a scene needs to give it an extra spark and the camera follows suit in that respect. In a number of areas the CGI holds up well, but in many areas they are badly dated with some of the action scenes are affected by this. Even though Spider- Man swinging through New York looks great, there is a lack of weight to his movements that makes it obvious that CG was used. As far as the writing is concerned, all feel that the more humane aspects are expertly handled, but the superhero material suffers. There is a lot of emotion to be found in Peter's guilt and his connection with Mary Jane, yet his heroic antics do come across as clichéd and don't fit what the film appears to going for at all. The Green Goblin falls foul to a number of especially bad moments, the finish it scene and the ''Sleep..'' line are just cringe-worthy in the worst possible way.Conclusion: So while it is probable that Spider-Man was the first big modern superhero film and did start a tremendously successful trilogy, I simply think that it is a decent film, nothing more or less. It does offer a lot of entertainment and a heart which many superhero films lack, but it's susceptible to falling down when it looks like it will soar. In Sam Raimi you have an appealing director and yet I don't think he is fully able to do what he wished. What we get is a script that becomes too cluttered and a villain that is way too campy when the majority of the film isn't. With Maguire we have an easy to like lead adding to a very solid supporting cast and I do enjoy the relationships the characters have. In a way I wish there was more of that emotion. Instead we get a film that just about manages to balance heart over silliness.",6,0,0,7 June 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," A Solid Entry
","X-Men: Days of Future Past saw Bryan Singer return to the director's chair for the film series that he helped spark, having something of a mixed legacy since he chose not to direct The Last Stand. Following on from the effortlessly entertaining and swaggering First Class was never going to be an easy feat, especially with director Matthew Vaughn deciding not to return. However, a smart decision was made with Days of Future Past to craft a time-leaping plot with the political and social uncertainty of 1970's United States. Singer's familiarity with the character shines through which leads to an inventive and exciting entry to the series.Story: In an apocalyptic future both humans and mutants are hunted by Sentinels, originally created in the 1970's to hunt mutants. Wolverine is forced to go back in time and prevent the assassination of the creator of the Sentinels, Bolivar Trask, in order to stop this future from happening. This story works perfectly in both creating a thrilling journey and in merging the old cast with the new. Sending Wolverine into the past to meet the younger Xavier and Magneto creates its own amusing outcomes, but it also allows for loose ends to be tied up. We find out how many of these characters came to be and how they're links to the X-Men were formed. The film also manages to expertly capture the feeling of unrest after the end of the Vietnam War and of the political paranoia found in many 70's thrillers.Heroes: Hugh Jackman is a great lead once again as Wolverine takes centre stage. By this point he has all of the characters intricacies down perfectly and provides plenty of energy as well as humour. James McAvoy is excellent as a much more vulnerable Xavier who struggles to embrace his power and his arc throughout the film is carried off well, while Patrick Stewart makes a welcomed return as the older Xavier.Villains: Michael Fassbender impresses again as Magneto. Showing that the characters conflict began early is a clever move and Fassbender makes his struggle feel so believable. Ian McKellen is also good fun in his return to the role. Peter Dinklage is superb in an understated performance as Trask. Making the character a dwarf is a nice subtle contrast to the mutants, but outside of that Dinklage gives the dialogue weight and provides a reserved intensity that works fantastically.Support: Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique plays a much larger role in the plot here. She being the one who attempts the assassination and the character's DNA being used to craft the Sentinels. Lawrence is simply okay in the role. Nicholas Hoult does standout as Beast, giving the role are geekiness without overdoing it.Action: The action scenes are as slick and stylish as ever before, with the emphasis on the scope of the sequences rather than the physicality. Arguably the highlight scene is breaking Magneto out of the Pentagon. Featuring super speedster Quicksilver, the editing is fantastic and the sheer inventiveness of the scene is a joy to behold. The climax involving the White House is also very creative.Music: John Ottman's score is very Hans Zimmer like. There's a lot of throbbing synths and bombastic brass that can get distracting. That said, his more restrained pieces are very effective and work well as a backdrop to the drama.Production: The visuals in the film are great and Singer shows that he can still make things look classy. As stated, what impressed me the most was that ability to capture the 1970's so effectively, with the film strongly invoking thrillers such as 'Marathon Man' and 'All the President's Men' for its era of paranoia. Switching these social and political issues over to the mutants was handled with grace. The effects were flawless for the most part, with the Sentinels looking unique as well as intimidating and images like Magneto lifting a football stadium looking spectacular. The story and character writings are a strength, with the film doing a really impressive job in explaining all of the motivations behind the characters decisions. I think Mystique lacks mystery, but her struggle between good and evil is played out well. I think the films main flaws lie in comparison to the earlier films in that I think at times it lacks the fluidity of X2 and the enthusiasm of First Class despite its intelligent story-telling.Conclusion: Days of Future Past is another strong entry in the X-Men series, simultaneously developing its universes past whilst building onto its characters futures. There's a great deal fleshed out here and the story never loses focus, which is all the more impressive when you realise just how much is going on. We're at a point now where we really understand these characters and their personalities, so going into the past is actual a good logical choice. There is almost nothing to fault from a technical, action and acting standpoint, while Singer directs as if he's never been away. The film works on both levels, providing an entertaining action trip and for offering some interesting social commentary from that period.",7,4,5,5 June 2016
Quantum of Solace," Pile of Rubbish
","Bond Review. Title: Sounds very odd, but kind of makes sense given the story.Pre-Titles: Bond is involved in a high-speed chase as he travels to Siena with Mr. White in his boot and just manages to escape his pursuers. This opening could have been brilliant, but it is filmed horribly and edited to within an inch of its life. Every cut lasts half a second, making impossible to tell what's actually going on and sucking any enjoyment out of what should be an exciting opening.Theme Song: The first Bond duet by Jack White and Alicia Keys is one to forget. The melody and composition are actually pretty good, but the singing and lyrics are woeful. White is totally out of place and Keys honestly sounds like a cat being strangled, put them together and its ear torture.Plot: Bond tracks an organisation named Quantum and hunts them down in a state of revenge. He quickly discovers that its leader, developer Dominic Greene, plans to drain the Bolivian water supply. The plot had the potential to be very exciting, but it is told in such a confusing and mundane way that you lose interest very fast. Part of it feels like a Bond revenge mission and the other part feels like an old-school world domination plot, and these two styles don't mix whatsoever. The whole story itself feels rushed and the characters are given no convincing development.James Bond: Daniel Craig is the best thing here, yet he can't keep the film afloat. He nails the brooding edge of the character once more and adds even more physicality to the role, while being compelling with his expressions. However there's no balance, as he is given poor dialogue and doesn't get a chance to show his charming side, making him come off as a little too gloomy.Bond Girls: Both Bond girls are simply boring. Olga Kurylenko is convincing as the emotionally damaged Camille but she gets nothing interesting to do, looks constantly angry and has no chemistry with Craig. Gemma Arterton at least has some fun as agent Fields, but she gets too little screen time to make an impact and just feels like a throwaway character.Villains: Words don't do justice to how dull a villain Dominic Greene. Making a shadier businessman type of villain isn't a bad idea, but he has no personality and is not remotely convincing as a threat in any way. He doesn't say anything memorable, he doesn't do anything worth remembering, he looks like a depressed diplomat and most of the time he stands around looking bored. Joaquin Cosio at least looks the part as Greene's supplier General Medrano and he is intimidating, but the character is only glossed over and his role seems shoehorned in.Support: Judi Dench is as solid as ever in an expanded role as M, but she is in the field way too much. Giancarlo Giannini makes a welcome return as Mathis and is amusing, but doesn't get much to do. Jeffrey Wright's is completely wasted as Leiter, all he does is drink and look indifferent.Action: The action is intense, but there's way too much of it and it's filmed dreadfully. We get a chase along rooftops, boat chases, helicopter chases and countless shots of Bond walloping people with all of it done in shaky cam which means you can't really tell what is happening. As a result you simply don't care what is going on. The climax is a good set-up at a desert hotel, but Bond's fight with Greene is pathetic and it quickly becomes explosions galore.Score: David Arnold provides another decent score. He offers a fitting backdrop to the rough approach of the film in many scenes and his slower tracks are appropriately moody. However it is a bit lacklustre compared to his previous efforts.Production Values: Foster deserves most of the blame here for his terrible directing. As said the action sequences are a mess, while the dialogue heavy scenes are shot blandly and the 'important' scenes don't feel remotely important. The editing is the other issue as the film looks like it was edited by a maniac. It is all just lightning quick cuts, close-ups of people looking really irritated and the incredibly annoying shaky cam tormenting our senses. The pace is all off as well and it feels like one long action scene, it's like the film cannot slow down and that results in nothing being given room to breathe or develop. The writing is simply terrible. Was Bond's mission engaging? No. Was the villain's scheme interesting? No. Where the characters well written? No. As a result it is so hard to care about anything on screen. The locations are all good, but there is way too much globe hoping going on and if it wasn't for the awkward cards telling you then I wouldn't have a clue where Bond was.Conclusion: If Casino Royale was an Aston Martin, then Quantum of Solace is like taking that Aston Martin and driving it into a brick wall. Everything that Casino Royale had done so well has been completely done away with for no reason at all. The characters are all boring and only capable of being angry, the action is one massive mess, the plot is ridiculous given this more grounded portrayal and Bond has gone from feeling like a real person to a crazed wrecking machine. I love the dark and intense Bond, but there has to either be some levity or a really intriguing premise because otherwise it just becomes a chore to get through otherwise and that is exactly what Quantum of Solace is.",5,32,46,31 July 2015
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Oh What Could Have Been
","You will struggle to find a film that is more synonymous with what could have been than The Lost World. The original Jurassic Park was a massive success which prompted Michael Crichton to write a sequel (even if little of the novel is used here). Spielberg was back on board, much of the same technical team was back and a host of talented actors filled the cast. Even with all of that the film is nowhere near as good as it should have been, yet it's not the disaster many make it out to be. The film looks too good, the music too immersive and the supporting cast too solid for it to be a failure. It is simply too well made for that. Instead we're left with a film that happens to be a bizarre mixture, brilliant on a technical level but infuriating on a writing one.The biggest issue lies with the main characters. Jeff Goldblum as edgy mathematician Ian Malcolm was a fan favourite from the first film, so making him the lead makes sense from a logical point but it simply doesn't work. Malcolm was at his best commenting on the situation and interjecting pieces of humour, but once you have him as the main character you lose all of that. His edginess is awkward, his humour wears thin quick and he becomes irritating. Goldblum looks bored throughout and his habit of whispering important lines is maddening. Julianne Moore (who is usually solid) looks lost here, though it's hard to fault her as Sarah Harding is just a typically plucky scientist. I don't think Vince Vaughn is funny, but going by this film he needs to steer clear of anything resembling drama. The film actually managed to make me miss Sam Neill.I like the way in which the story builds and I also like the way all of the characters are involved. Even the idea for there to be a Site B fits the plot fine. Yet the more things move along, the more inflexible and confused the film seems to get. Characters do things that are downright foolish (Harding not getting rid of her shirt soaked with T-Rex blood) or events happen just so a dinosaur can go on a rampage. All taking place while Goldblum delivers some painful lines. I don't even want to begin to discuss Malcolm's daughter defeating a Velociraptor with a gymnast move, it really is that absurd. And yes Malcolm's daughter Kelly sneaks on to the island, playing a mildly important role. Luckily she isn't needlessly taking over scenes and as a result doesn't become as annoying as her father.The dinosaurs look just as good as before, impressive considering we see much more of them than we did in the original film. The blend of the humans and dinosaurs is seamless, with the hunting scene presenting this the best. Seeing the hunters tussling with the dinosaurs just looks wonderful, holding up perfectly. The lead hunter Roland Tembo is played by Pete Postlethwaite in what is superb casting. Postlethwaite is the type of actor who could make the phonebook sound interesting and he's gripping every time he's on screen. Similarly is Arliss Howard as the slimy businessman Ludlow who is the closest thing to a villain. In a very different role than we're used to seeing him in, Howard manages to make a person you enjoy hating. John Williams' score carries the same feel as the original film and fits the scenery well. His sound fits Spielberg's work so well that by this point it would just feel wrong to not have his music here.There were countless images that impressed me from a visual viewpoint. There are plenty of uses of blue filter and silhouette throughout that really add atmosphere to the film, whilst Spielberg's use of spotlights continues in the same vein. The action sequences are very elaborate both in scope and scale. Yet you do have to question the 'point' of this action however. Both the trailer hanging off the side of the cliff and the T-Rex's climatic rampage through San Diego are visually impressive as well as entertaining, but they don't lead to anything or add to the characters. It is like they're there simply because an action sequence was needed and that doesn't fit this type of film. The editing is troublesome too. Certain scenes will end too quickly or before anything was properly developed. The slow zoom doesn't create tension if it's not used right. I agree that the film is darker than the original, but I certainly would have enjoyed it to go further and cut out some of the sillier moments.Once we get our coda in San Diego the film ends on something of a jovial note. I cannot deny that it is a frequently entertaining film, but it is also one that is unsatisfying because you know that something really good could have come out of this. It almost feels like for every step forward the film made, it took one back. I'm not sure what the answer would have been. Certainly having Ian Malcolm (with an irritating Goldblum) lead was a terrible decision, but the potential was still here in for something special and the pieces were in place even if the right script wasn't. You can kind of tell Spielberg's heart wasn't fully in this one and that he probably did it because of the demand, the majority of his technical expertise is on display but the film lacks the heart and energy that we are used to seeing him deliver.",4,11,18,6 June 2016
Cars," Simply a ''good' Pixar film
","Cars appears to be the odd one out in Pixar's initial run, in that it wasn't meet with as much acclaim as its previous efforts. It was still well received by most people, but many agreed that it didn't push the boundaries or really try something inventive like the other films. I kind of have the same reaction, in that I think it's a good film but it's certainly missing somethings that could push to greatness. The premise of a world populated only by cars is a creative one, but it's something that has been done before and even the idea of a big fish trapped in a small pond has been done numerous times by other films. Maybe that's the issue with the film, it does these ideas well yet never does anything special with them.The film features Lightning McQueen, a headstrong race car, who on his way to a final wrecks the road of a town on Route 66 named Radiator Springs. The town sentence him to fix the road, which he tries to do before his big race and he of course learns a lot about small town life. On the surface this is a very simple story about knowing when to slow down, yet that leads to one of the films weaknesses in that it's very predictable. We know that McQueen is going to realise that he's too impulsive and that he'll end up falling in love with the town as well as the cars within it. So there are no real surprises here and you know the turns that this story is going to take which can make things boring. With that said, the methods they use to tell the story are very effective. I think one of the films strengths is its laid-back tone and part of that comes from the story of this small town. It's not often you see Pixar tackle this kind of story and I actually think it's a nice change of pace, while the calmer tone gives the film a lot of charm.Lightning McQueen is a different kind of protagonist for Pixar and again it's nice to see them do something different. He's reckless and arrogant yet it's clear that most of that comes from the racing environment, while he is willing to learn and change which still makes him a solid lead. His romantic interest Sally is okay, she doesn't have much beyond being smart and bubbly, but she serves her purpose fine. Doc is the grouch with a haunted past and it is nice to have Paul Newman voice him, but he is a bit dull and when don't get enough insight into his character. Mater can be annoying, but he makes a good companion and actually gets a lot of funny lines. The rest of the towns inhabitants are underdeveloped but still fun, such as a hippie van voiced by George Carlin and a Ferrari loving mechanic. The score by Randy Newman is good, but the soundtrack is excellent. It uses a lot of songs that obviously revolve around driving but nearly all of them fit the film perfectly when they show up and give some scenes more of an emotional kick.The animation is once again excellent. It impresses me how well balanced it is. The race tracks are very fast paced and stylised with a real feeling of adrenaline to them. While the beautiful and dusty landscapes of Radiator Springs are simply wonderful to look at, and the town itself is such an attractive looking place that it's difficult not to enjoy being there. It's always nice to see Pixar animate more modern things and they do a great job here as usual. The film doesn't really have a man villain, but Chick Hicks is the closest thing and he is boring. Michael Keaton's tries his best voice wise, but Hicks is just a typical mean rival and is only here for the morale to be hammered home some more. The whole concept itself is also an issue in that nothing about it is ever explained. We don't know where these cars came from or how they even do simple things like go to the toilet. Though I guess that's more of a problem with the idea not the film.All in all Cars is another fun and easy to enjoy Pixar effort. I certainly agree with most that it isn't up to Pixar's usual high standards and I do feel that is because it doesn't try to really push itself in new directions. It sets up its story, as well as its morale, and just follows it by the books without challenging our expectations. Saying I do think it has more than enough going for it. Its lead is different to the norm, the many side characters are distinct, the animation is superb and it is enjoyably laid-back. Sometimes it is nice to have a film to concentrates more on life in a small place and seeing Pixar tackle such a subject means it is never boring. So while certainly not one of its best, Cars is definitely a very enjoyable piece from Pixar.",7,0,1,26 January 2016
X-Men: The Last Stand," Underdeveloped
","After the success of the previous two X-Men films, Bryan Singer jumped ship in a failed attempt to reboot the Superman series with the torpid Superman Returns. This left the third X-Men film in an awkward position, where a multitude of directors where considered and a fixed deadline meant it would have to be rushed to completion. Brett Ratner was a very odd choice for director, given his pure entertainment films appear to be at odds with Singer's more layered work. When it's all said and done, the film clearly suffers because of indecision. It feels like there was very little time devoted to the majority of characters and that the story was nowhere near as detailed as it could have been. Instead of an appropriate climax, the original trilogy simply ends on a bland note. Story: A cure which can turn mutants human has been discovered. With Charles Xavier's school weary of the cure, the government consider using it as a weapon and Magneto forms a brotherhood with the aim of destroying any notion of a cure. At the same time Jean Grey returns and her destructive second personality that Xavier had held back has been unleashed. The basic idea of this plot is a fantastic one, creating all kinds of conflict if the mutants could become 'normal'. The issue is that the film only touches upon the surface of that idea. Then we have the issues regarding Jean Grey. Though the film makes it clear that she has a second persona, we're given no information as to why she is wreaking havoc and her part in the story seems all too convenient.Heroes: Hugh Jackman is still enjoyable as Wolverine, once again bringing roughness and intensity to the role. The character takes the centre stage throughout and proves to be an engaging lead. Halle Berry also gets more to do as Storm, but ends up as boring as ever. Berry is a weak actress and her dialogue carries none of the weight needed. Kelsey Grammar is very enjoyable as Beast, fitting the characters intellectual mind and looking effective under a lot of make-up. Patrick Stewart is still a commanding presence as Xavier and it's a shame his part is cut so short.Villains: Magneto is once again the perfect conflicted villain. His actions are cruel and persistent, yet we understand why he is going to such lengths to protect his kind. Ian McKellen is excellent again and he really brings a calm control to the role. Famke Janssen is decent as a more sinister Jean, but struggles to deliver an effective performance because of the characters uncertain motivation. Support: The likes of Shawn Ashmore and Ellen Page as Iceman and Kitty provide some solid support as their characters are fleshed out more. Sadly the vast majority of the team is wasted. Rogue only ever shows up to complain about something. The likes of Mystique, Pyro, Colossus and Angel are given next to nothing to do or say. Worst of all is that Cyclops is once again completely misused, appearing for all of five minutes before being killed off and barely getting mentioned again.Action: The action sequences are relatively strong. We get plenty of scenes that display various mutants showcasing their powers and they are always fun to watch, with the effects looking impressive too. The final confrontation actually serves as a suitable climax and it's always enjoyable to see the X-Men fighting together, while it has the right amount of gravitas and heft to work as an end battle. Music: John Powell's score is a typical superhero one, but it fits the film fine. It is hard to say that it provides memorable themes, but it knows when to be in the background for certain scenes and it does have lavish moments that push the action further.Production: Visually the film is impressive. It has the same icy look carried over from the previous two films and despite Ratner's limited directing style he knows how to create some stimulating shots. The writing is where most of the issues lie. As stated, the smart ideas that are behind the plot of the film are never properly fleshed out and that is so disappointing because we could have easily had intelligence to go with the action. There's also a lot of clichéd moments spread throughout that feel forced and some of the dialogue can be particularly painful (some of the worst coming from Juggernaut). With such a vast array of characters it was always going to be had to flesh everyone out, but the failure to do anything of note with or give true motivations the likes of Storm and Jean Grey is unacceptable. The film would have benefited greatly from a longer running time in order to make some of the characters clearer.Conclusion: While I don't think The Last Stand is the train wreck that many make it out to be, it is a rather bland and disappointing effort. Most of that comes because of how good the film could have been. The plot was a very interesting one and many of these characters are familiar faces who we care about. The problem is that the story was never looked into enough and there are simply far too many characters thrown into the mix. Ratner clearly doesn't have the subtlety and understanding of the series that Singer did. He makes the action look great, but he loses focus when it comes to the deeper subjects. It's always nice to see Jackman, McKellen, Stewart and co in these roles, but if nothing of note is going to be done with them then it becomes an underwhelming experience.",3,0,1,2 June 2016
The Incredibles," Truly outstanding superhero homage from Pixar
","The Incredibles is another classic computer-animated film from Pixar. Riding high from past successes Pixar decided to do a film different to the norm by featuring all human characters for the first time and giving Brad Bird free reign over the whole project, and it pays off no end with one of their strongest efforts. The story starts off with superheroes Mr Incredible and Elastigirl keeping Metroville safe from crime and getting married. This all stops when people begin suing the 'Supers' as they are forced to quit and go into a relocation programme. Fifteen years pass and they try to live a normal life with their children, but Mr Incredible misses the glory days. He gets his chance via a mysterious call to a secret mission. However he quickly discovers his past is back to haunt him and a plot to kill off all Supers. The plot is excellent as it holds up in so many ways as an actioner and drama with comedic elements. The similarities to other Superhero media, especially Watchmen, are done perfectly too. The cast and characters are brilliant. Mr Incredible is everything a lead needs, he's charismatic and 'super' but he's humane and caring, it makes a very three dimensional character backed wonderfully by Craig T. Nelson's strong voice. Elastigirl is also great being a dominant and getting in on the action, the unique voice of Holly Hunter works a charm. Dash and Violet are also a lot of fun. They don't become annoying like many children do, they have good personalities and their powers are well worked in. Jason Lee was great as Syndrome, who's a superb villain being so unlikable and evil. Samuel L. Jackson is a lot of fun as the cool Frozone and Brad Bird is hilarious as obsessed Superhero costume designer Edna Mode. The Incredibles is almost perfect is every way you could imagine. The action is superb from the many battles on the island to the explosive climax. The pacing is excellently managed, it takes time to develop the characters and lets events pan out with care. The vast amount of homages to Superheroes is wonderful. The way the film builds an array of Supers and has fun with them is a joy to behold. The nods to The Fantastic Four and Watchmen were very impressive. The music from Michael Giacchino is just marvellous moving from heroic to Bond like, the main theme and 'Kronos Unveiled' are just magnificent. The animation is brilliant, all the Supers look unique and are all memorably designed, and everything looks fantastic wherever it takes place. It's also refreshing that The Incredibles is much more older children/adult oriented than anything Pixar has done before or since. It doesn't shy away from the violence and how much the entire family has their lives put on the line. Plus the film must be commended for being much more serious and intense, there are still some great jokes, but its great how it uses the subject matter in a thoughtful way. Overall The Incredibles is both really funny and really well made, it's certainly one of Pixar's best due to how good everything really is.",9,1,1,31 October 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Tonally All Over the Place yet Entertaining
","Even though The Amazing Spider-Man was not as successful as the Sam Raimi films it did well enough critically and commercially to raise hopes for an effective sequel. I personally found the first film boring because the more serious take on Spider-Man simply doesn't work because of the type of character he is. With that said Garfield and Stone have enough chemistry to carry any film, which I'm pleased to say continues here. The film certainly has its good points and importantly takes itself less seriously than the previous film, but it is still awkward from a tonal viewpoint and suffers from a recurring comic book problem of forcing too many characters into the film.Story: Spider-Man deals with numerous obstacles in his life including his fragmented relationship with his girlfriend Gwen, his rediscovered friendship with a gravely ill Harry Osborn and the emergence of an electricity powered villain. All the while he comes closer to finding out what really happened to his parents. As you can tell that's quite a lot to fit in and it's the inability to give all the arcs proper time that is one of the films main issues. The relationship between Peter and Gwen is excellently developed as well as the most enjoyable aspect yet again, but Electro is built-up only to be completely absent for the middle section and Harry's personality changes entirely in the blink of an eye. Also I don't think the sub-plot of Peter's parents is interesting and it serves little importance to the film overall.Hero: Andrew Garfield does a good job once again as our title hero. I think he has just the right balance of confidence and sincerity as well as looking perfect for the role. He might lack some of the quirks and geekiness of the character, but I don't think that he's trying to play Peter in that style and the character is much more at ease with who he is here than previously which works for the film. Villains: Jamie Foxx is underwhelming as Electro. To be fair to him the character is simply The Riddler from Batman Forever, a nerd who goes from worshipping Spider-Man to wanting him dead. He has very little motivation, the glowing blue design is distracting and he only ends up playing a small part in the film as a whole. Dane DeHaan does an impressive job as Harry. Harry's personality and motivations are extremely inconsistent (such as the way he wants Peter's blood to live), but DeHaan is a magnetic screen presence and his delivery of the dialogue is always believable.Support: Emma Stone is wonderful as Gwen, breathing so much charm and honesty into the role. The film does deal with Gwen's aspirations and smartly the character continues to develop throughout. Once again Stone's expressions are great and she is such a warm presence that you can't help but grow attached to the character. Sally Field is also good as a more relaxed Aunt May. However the less said about Paul Giamatti's stupidly over-the-top cameo as 'Rhino' the better.Action: The action is a little weak here. The main fight scenes with Electro look really good and are well edited, but they don't last long enough to leave an impact and the slow motion is used too much. The climax suffers from exactly the same problem. Though it is exciting to see Spider-Man pursuing criminals with the police, there is just something about the CGI used as he swings around the city that makes him lack a sense of gravity or heft.Music: The score by Hans Zimmer and numerous guest musicians is certainly different to most. It features a lot of electronic and dance elements that work well with the action sequences, whilst there are some really eerie parts during the creepier scenes that add a lot of atmosphere. It definitely has a uniqueness that makes it standout.Production: From a visual viewpoint the film is more colourful and interesting to look at than its predecessor. The film has a more modern look to it, with many of the buildings and technology looking especially striking. I'm also really impressed with how New York is shot as it always looks beautiful. The character designs are mixed with the new Spider-Man costume looking great, but the Electro redesign looking rather generic. Tone-wise the film is messy. For the most part it retains a more adventurous light-hearted feel with pieces of drama (like the Raimi films), but at times it does go a little too goofy, see Rhino, and at others such as Harry's transformation it gets downright creepy. I think the ending reflects that best as the scenes following Gwen's death are genuinely emotional but the film ends with Peter back to his witty old self, it's just so jarring. The romance is the best part however, the chemistry between our leads is perfect and a lot of great situation humour comes from the relationship.Conclusion: So while I do think The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a flawed film, I do find it more enjoyable than the previous entry and almost on par with the Raimi films. Its real success comes from Garfield and Stone, who are both excellent in their roles and really make you care about their characters. The romance is what holds the film together, while I think the visuals and music are both very effective. In contrast I do find the action tedious and the tonal shifts distracting. The villains are a weak point (though the actors are fine) as neither is fleshed out enough, I seriously think that if Harry was the sole enemy and fleshed out properly then we could have had a great film. For me this is a good film from a purely entertaining stance and it's easy to be wrapped up in the plight of our two main characters despite its problems.",3,1,4,22 March 2016
Lincoln," Exceedingly Unengaging
","As far as films go Lincoln had a lot of potential. Spielberg has shown that he can aptly handle dialogue-heavy, historical films in the past and Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent in pretty much every role he's ever done. The teaming of these two for a film about one of the most influential Presidents in American history should have been a gripping experience. Yet it ends up being a major let-down, brushing aside any of Lincoln's rise to power or his first term and solely concentrating on the passing of the 13th Amendment which even the film struggles to understand the reasoning for. As a result of that why not call the film '13th Amendment' or something along those lines, inside of leading people to believe it is about the man himself.I'm fine with dialogue-heavy films, but here the dialogue is handled and delivered in an incredibly dull fashion. There is no tension or emotion to anything anyone says throughout, which results in the speeches being flat and the lines coming off as if they were rehearsed to death instead of sounding naturalistic. All Lincoln does is tell analogies or stories that sound nice but have little to do with driving the film forward.Day-Lewis is brilliant as always in what is a reserved but authoritative portrayal of Lincoln and he looks the part, though again he's let-down by the shoddy script. The problem with the cast is that there are simply too many speaking parts and most people get lost in the shuffle. Great actors like Sally Field, James Spader, Jared Harris and Bruce McGill get nothing of note to do or character of any substance. Only Tommy Lee Jones stands out as the no nonsense Thaddeus Stevens, but even then he's just doing what he always does.Visually the film is tough to fault. The lighting is very natural and the costumes look fantastic, helping to create a real sense of another time. The make-up is again very strong especially on Day- Lewis. I would have liked more shots of the area and towns to create more of an atmosphere, because just watching people talking in rooms for long periods does get boring. Spielberg's direction is nothing special either, he keeps everything very basic and concentrates on the actors instead of any stylish shots. The lack of any engaging quality is the films biggest downfall. Most people will know what takes place on the night of April 15th and in order to keep the audience invested despite that the film really had to try its hardest to give the characters strong emotions or make the dialogue interesting which it fails to do. By the time we reach the end of the film you don't really care what happens to anyone once the Amendment has been passed and the film just sort of ends on a flat note.So for me Lincoln is yet another example of failed potential. A real gripping and thought-provoking piece could have been crafted here, and we know that the likes of Spielberg could make that possible. There's nothing wrong with Day-Lewis' Oscar winning performance and you can't fault the films visual authenticity. Yet it is massively let-down by its ponderous, uncertain script and a distinct lack of urgency or drive to the narrative. This isn't the type of film that can almost grind to a halt at times, which it proves is its biggest issue. It's better to think of what could have been than be bored by this underwhelming effort.",3,0,2,1 March 2016
Big Hero 6," On to a Winner
","Big Hero 6 can be considered as Disney's first outright animated superhero film and its surprising that it took so long given the genres immense popularity. There have been times when the area has been touched on before and Pixar have delved into it with The Incredibles, but this is the first time we get to see Disney adapt an actual comic to the big screen. Loosely based on the Marvel comic strip, the film takes advantage of being animated and allows itself to be as creative as possible. It follows Hiro as he, his robot Baymax and four of his friends form a superhero team following an accident involving his brother.The story flows very well, providing plenty of excitement and adventure, whilst getting surprisingly emotional on a number of occasions. Our protagonist Hiro does grow throughout the film and it is very effective. We see him struggle to decide his future, then his world comes crashing down and it's not until Baymax starts to help him that he realises he can depend on on his friends. There is certainly a depth to this story that goes beyond many Disney films, with many parts touching on issues such as depression and the how important friendship can be to an adolescent. It is done very subtly and never tries to push any of these ideas down the audience's throat, which was a welcomed thing. Though I would have enjoyed more superhero material I can't fault the film for dealing with such complex themes.The characters are both entertaining and relatable. Hiro can be a little flippant but he has all the traits of someone struggling with themselves. He can be self-assured, humorous and brash yet he is also sensitive and despondent at times. He is a well-rounded character and he develops as the film goes on. Baymax is by far the funniest thing here. He gets plenty of amusing lines and offers some great physical comedy, but it's his warm temperament and genuine innocent that are always charming. Hiro's brother Tadashi is also very likable and the bond between the two is strong from the outset. I do think the side characters lack depth, especially compared to Hiro and Baymax, but they all have clear personalities and do offer plenty of laughs throughout. The main villain is something of a bore given his lack of personality, but his motivations are well thought-out.Disney delivers the goods once again from an animation stance. The animation is very slick and detailed, giving just the right balance of colour and refinement to proceedings which match both the superhero style and the more subdued tone. The idea to combine San Francisco and Tokyo into the same city was genius and it looks spectacular here, the amount of detail in meshing the two cities together is clear and it provides a very unique setting. The action sequences were also very impressive. The fight scenes were graceful and smooth allowing for a lot of cool techniques, whilst still retaining a weight that made it look forceful. I also enjoyed the way in which the heroes' powers were shown and they were inventive with what they created. The dramatic writing was certainly a standout feature. There were even a few tear inducing moments, most of them thanks to Hiro and his relationship to his brother. It felt like there was a real connection between these characters, even with a robot like Baymax, which is where a lot of the films strength comes from. There is a real maturity to this writing and an understanding, the writers really captured what it feels like to be going through these emotions. Even the villains motivation, which can suffer from feeling forced, felt totally justifiable here. The comedy worked well for the most part too. Though I would have liked little more, there was plenty of versatility in the jokes and the slapstick was fantastic when it popped up.For me Big Hero 6 continued Disney's run of excellent CG animation. This is certainly an example of a film that has more to it than expected. What appears to be a fun superhero adventure frequently delves into some pretty mature themes and the characters have motivations that are deeper than they first appear. I enjoyed these characters, wanting to spend time with them and see them develop. From a technical aspect the film is tough to fault, the animation looks beautiful, the action is excellent and there is a lot of creativity to the world that it has crafted. A little more superhero and comedic pieces wouldn't have been out of place, but the film deserves credit for the challenging angle it takes. It's a film that balances itself perfectly and rewards you with its level of maturity.",7,2,2,5 May 2016
Brave," A very average effort from Pixar
","Pixar isn't known for its films falling into the 'average' category. All of their films are extremely inventive and feel genuine, excluding the lacklustre Cars and its weak sequel. However, Brave is a distinctly middle of the road effort from Pixar and one that lacks their usual innovative spark. For all its imaginative animation and varied comedic moments, you can't help but feel that something is missing when taking in the film as a whole. Set in mythical Scotland, the adventurous Princess Merida is told that she must marry despite her grievances. She defies her mother's wishes, receiving a potion from a witch and their relationship is tested in an unexpected way when the mother is turned into a bear. The film originally looked like it was going to tackle the challenges that Merida must face, but it becomes more of a film about the connection between a mother and daughter.Now this could be fine if it's done well, but two of the films biggest issues lie in the story. Firstly, the story is very predictable. From the very beginning of the conflict you know what's going to happen and that they'll be an obvious resolution at end, which is never properly explained anyway. Secondly, Merida has no arch and she doesn't change as the film progresses. She starts out free-spirited and irresponsible then she ends up being exactly the same way at the conclusion. She doesn't learn or develop despite what takes place between her and Elinor, in fact I'd argue that Elinor has a lot more growth as a result. Merida also isn't an enjoyable character because she is far too whiny and uninteresting to ever be truly invested in. She just comes across as an insensitive teenager, she isn't funny or smart and she isn't nearly as courageous as she's built up to be.With that said I did like the other characters. Elinor remains very dignified and likable despite all that she is put through. Fergus is an enjoyable king and gets plenty of laughs for his energetic behaviour, while having Billy Connolly voice him was smart idea. The Witch is more of a modern, fast-talker and she is amusing despite her limited appearance in all fairness. The three lords are all colourful and great fun, creating an entertaining sense of rivalry and providing most of the laughs. As a matter of fact the film does have a good sense of humour which is one of its strong points. The comedy is well varied, the slapstick is very well done and the majority of the jokes are at least amusing. Going back to the story, one thing that was good about it was the mother's mind becoming more bear-like over time, which was a nice twist and kept a tension that was badly needed.The animation is very impressive once again. It's always nice to see Pixar tackle different places and medieval Scotland was a smart choice. A real sense of wonder and majesty was crafted simply from the visuals alone, the landscapes look beautiful and even the designs on the characters (such as Merida's distinctive hair) are so detailed. The Scottish folklore was really enjoyable and created a strong atmosphere which makes it such a shame so little of it was used because certainly it would have made things much more interesting had it been developed. Patrick Doyle deserves credit for his distinctive score, it carries that Celtic sound thanks to the strong use of bagpipes but it also has many gripping melodies and does create a good backdrop for the images. In contrast, there is a lack of emotional connection throughout the film and that's something Pixar usually excels at. I found myself not caring about any of the characters or where the film was going to end up, which turned it into a dull experience at times and especially during the middle section.So for all of Brave's great technical aspects, it is let down where it truly matters with its story and main character. The story is so by-the-book and predictable that it's so difficult to be engaged by the journey it undertakes, it takes no risks and pushes no boundaries. It doesn't help when you have a dull lead because Merida is very boring to follow and as said she doesn't grow as a character. The film does have positives because the side characters, animation and score are all very good. Yet because this is from a studio as talented as Pixar we're always going to expect something great because they're fully capable of producing it. In a way it's disappointing more than anything else because the film did have so much potential and it will simply go down as a noticeably ordinary Pixar effort.",5,2,4,22 January 2016
Shrek 2," Great sequel
","It is never an easy task to follow up such a big hit as Shrek was, however Shrek 2 does a truly fantastic job and you would have a strong case to argue that it is even better than the original. Taking everything that was so enjoyable from the first film, it places it in a different situation and adds a new set of interesting characters to interact with. Whereas I felt that the original Shrek film was content with parodying fairy-tales and letting its characters craft the laughs, Shrek 2 ups the adventure and adds all different kinds of jokes in order to making everything seem bigger than before. This method can so easily fail, but I'm very pleased with how well it works here.This story is nothing new as Shrek and Fiona are summoned to Far Far Away to meet Fiona's parents who are the king and queen, and unsurprisingly Shrek and the king don't get along. Even the beats and events are nothing we haven't seen before, but it does them with such strong wit and style that it breathes new life into these tropes. But it quickly turns out that the Fairy Godmother plans to have her son marry Fiona as was originally foreseen. This is more of the same, but the idea to do it is very inventive. Shrek drinks a potion that turns him and Fiona human, which causes all kinds of issues. That is so creative and also a commendably brave decision in having the main character take on a different look for a lot of the film. I certainly think the strong characters are what make Shrek 2 so good. Shrek (with Mike Meyers' fun Scottish accent) is still the angry ogre, but his kind heart shines through. Donkey is again the comedic highlight thanks to his naivety and accidental annoyance while Eddie Murphy is simply perfect. Puss in Boots almost steals the film by bringing so much energy and by being a lovable presence. Both villains are a ton of fun. The Fairy Godmother (an excellent Jennifer Saunders) is as charismatic as she is evil and gets a lot of laughs, while Charming is an enjoyably vain and snooty. John Cleese and Julie Andrews are both superb as usual as the king and queen.As said the comedy is bigger and broader than before, with a great variety of jokes and nearly all of them work. The pop culture references littered throughout, the ironic use of fairy-tale heroines, all the villains hanging out at the 'Poison Apple' Inn and even the hilarious send up of Cops. Very few jokes fell flat and given how many there are that is quite impressive. The supporting fairy-tale characters, including Pinocchio and the Gingerbread Man, also make a welcomed return and provide plenty of laughs once again. The climax is outstanding. With nods to Ghostbusters and Mission: Impossible, it is both really funny and really exciting with some nice little twists thrown in too. The romance between Shrek and Fiona was another strong point of the film. I genuinely cared about their relationship and wanted to see them happy, while the predicament they are faced with at the end is gripping and it does send out a very good message. The animation is very vibrant and energetic, fitting the fast paced comedy and even allows for some good atmosphere when needed. Even the smaller details such as the backgrounds are very well designed. I enjoyed the use of pop songs and all of the tracks used fitted in perfectly. The use of 'Holding Out for a Hero' in the climax and sung by the Fairy Godmother added even more drive to the scene.Simply put Shrek 2 is a fantastic sequel. It continues in the same vein as the original and builds on to it as any good follow-up should do. It was smart to use a plot line that was familiar and could be altered just enough to make it feel fresh. The animation and music were uniformly excellent as usual from DreamWorks. Again though I think it's the characters that make the film work so well. The originals are great yet again, whilst all of the new characters fit in effortlessly and offer gravitas as well as comedy. Shrek 2 succeeds just like the original.",8,4,5,27 September 2015
Black Hawk Down," Could and Should Have Been so Much More
","You have to question what Black Hawk Down is trying to do in order to understand it. If it's trying to be a simple, straight to the point war film then I suppose it succeeds on a number of levels. If it's trying to tell a detailed and interesting account of real life events then it fails massively. This is a film where everything is on a surface level. Even attempt to dig a little deeper and you will be left bitterly disappointed. For all its technical excellence and hammering intensity, the film lacks intrigue or balance or emotion, just anything that makes you invested in what's taking place.The film is based around the real life Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia in 1993, when a raid by the U.S military went disastrously wrong and troops were trapped on the ground under heavy fire. I say based because a lot of stuff is fictionalised (as you would expect) despite what the film tells us. The first 30 minutes of the film are absolutely pointless in reflection. Instead of at least trying to develop the vast array of characters or explore their internal thoughts, the film just wastes time on a whole host of war movie clichés. The soldiers lounge around, they insult each other, some of them are scared but others are calmly confident. This might make them seem authentic, but it isn't going to make the audience remotely interested in them once the shooting begins.Once the troops land the film basically becomes one gigantic action sequence. Men are split up, helicopters get shot down, the injured have to be rescued and the superiors behind the scenes bark out orders. It's all done with great efficiency. However, the film is so pounding and forceful that it never gives itself a chance to breathe. As a result there is little chance to build up any drama or provide vulnerability.You have a number of capable actors present who are just playing blank slates when they could easily have delivered so much more. Eric Bana, Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, Jason Isaacs, Sam Shepard, these guys are perfect for the film yet they're so underused. Josh Hartnett is effectively the main character but he delivers a performance of dour machismo because the script won't let him do anything else. The Somalians themselves are faceless antagonists, which I don't usually have a major problem with as most war films have portrayed the opposite side negatively, but I think the lack of any type of development is disappointing. They just seem to want to irritate the American forces, there's little to them beyond that.Ridley Scott shoots the film with great vibrancy and a visceral edge. His vivid visual style is easily one of the films highlights. He manages to make the battle scenes feel up and close, giving them an almost documentary-like quality that works very well. There's also no denying that the action is incredibly gritty and intense. There's no attempts to sugar-coat or exaggerate and I respect the film for that. Plenty of blood is spilt, limbs are blown off, soldiers are trapped in wreckages, it's very brutal stuff and certainly not for the faint-hearted. The attempts to recreate these hectic fire fights are some of the film's most effective moments.Yet no matter what the eventual outcome of the film is, it boldly makes the point that these men are heroes. It doesn't matter if they're victorious or defeated, the fact that they were willing to die for their fellow man is enough. Now I like the thought behind this idea, but it ends up falling flat. Because the film doesn't explain why the soldiers are there, we never know what they risked their lives for. I don't like how the message ends up being handled or how preachy it gets. It's almost as if the film is saying that it doesn't really matter whether you're fighting for something that might be morally wrong because you stood by your fellow soldier and got behind your country. War films should always at least attempt to examine the psychology and reasoning behind war, but this is something that Black Hawk Down completely bypasses.Going back to my earlier point, the main problem with Black Hawk Down is that it is all surface. We end up knowing very little about why the United States is there in the first place, what they're trying to achieve or what is going through the minds of the soldiers. I understand that the film is trying to make these soldiers more true to life, but for the film to really work then they needed to be fleshed out because once the action starts you don't really care who lives or who dies. It doesn't even bother to deal with any complicated issues that may arise, whether they are political or moral. For all its grittiness and technical skill, if it's not going to develop anything then why should we should we try to be invested in it?",4,0,2,2 July 2016
Avatar," A Hollow, Entirely Predictable, Cliché-Riddled Gimmick
","This really could have been something special. Influential director James Cameron's first film since the mega-hit 'Titanic'. 12 years of waiting, in part so that the technology was advanced enough for the film to be made. The man who gave us Sci-Fi classics like 'The Terminator', 'T2: Judgement Day' and 'Aliens' giving us his most ambitious piece yet. But for all its visual grandeur, its technical marvel, its fine detail, Avatar ends up being a disheartening failure. Why? Because it makes the fatal mistake of completely ignoring the two things that are crucial in any film, story and character.The film follows paraplegic marine Jake Sully as he takes the place of his deceased brother on the avatar project. Based on the distant planet Pandora, the project involves controlling a body of the natives (known as the Na'vi) in order to gather information about them. Well so far so good, there's at least some creativity. All that disappears quickly. We learn that the military and business tycoons are there to take a valuable material called Unobtainium (oh how do they come up with this stuff). I'm so sick of these lazy plots that have suits taking what isn't there's. We get the message they're hammering us with, leave the indigenous people and their land alone. Of course Jake is persuaded by Colonel Quaritch to deliver information and secrets about the Na'vi directly to him so he can figure out their weakness in exchange for the spinal surgery Jake needs.But wait a second, something incredible happens. The more time Jake absorbs the Na'vi's culture, the more he grows to love its people and begins to doubt whether or not he can turn on them. Well I've never seen that before. Oh wait, I have in 'Dances with Wolves', 'Pocahontas' and 'The Last Samurai' to name but a few. It is exactly the same story as all of these. It has the same set-up, it follows the same beats, it has the same character motivations, and it even has the same preachy moral lesson. The white man comes to conquer, but the main character can't fight against the culture he initially dislikes but grows to care for. There is not a single moment in the film where I didn't know what was going to happen next. For all the money spent why couldn't they write a better story?Throughout all this Jake develops a relationship with a Na'vi called Neytiri and it is literally there just to serve the plot. These two share absolutely no chemistry. There isn't even a reason for them to like each other. The only reason Neytiri changes her mind is because some kind of sprite lands on him and that's a sign that he has a good heart. Sadly the film is littered with convenient and mystical hogwash like that which is never looked at in any detail. It's fair enough that the film has its own mythology, but at least try to give some meaning. The film suffers badly from lack of explanation. Like why are the military so fixed on destroying the planet to gain the material when it's clear that the Na'vi can be befriended with relative ease? It is basically because we need some villains and those mean humans will do just fine. The only thing as one-note as the story are the characters. Sam Worthington's agent deserves a medal for getting one of the blandest, most expressionless, cardboard cut-out actors ever to grace the screen to helm a film of this magnitude. It boggles my mind as to how insipid an actor he is. Jake as a character isn't very interesting but there are countless actors who could of at least brought something to the role. Zoe Saldana suffers too, but that's mainly because Neytiri is a totally unlikeable and irritating character. You even have good actors like Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang wasted in clichéd roles as the plucky scientist and the colonel blinded by stupidity. In a film like this we need characters that are either relatable or interesting in order to keep them from being swamped. You'd think Cameron of all people would know this. What I can't discount is just how visually stunning the film is. The world created is something we've seen before, but the detail and vibrancy really is something to behold. This film is gorgeous. The textures, the colour scheme, the shades of light, the environment of Pandora, it all looks pretty incredible and I can see why it took so long to craft. The CGI both stands out on its own and blends with the live-action seamlessly. The Na'vi's design is a bit conventional, but again the detail gone into creating them is there for all to see. The visuals truly are the films only outstanding feature. The same can't be said of the action sequences even though they're are decently staged and can get suitably intense, they're nowhere near as imaginative or gripping as they could have been. That's partly because you don't care who lives or dies.James Cameron did something here that I struggle to understand. He made a film with such creative potential and possibilities safe. Something that is a boring and hollow experience. Something that is so reliant on its visual brilliance that without it there is nothing to offer. How could someone as talented as Cameron create a story that is so cliché riddled and unengaging? In many ways the film's success is disappointing. It's telling filmmakers that we want more films where the stories and characters can be as basic as possible as long as we get some impressive visuals, where we value style over substance. I want style, but I also want a film that I can be invested in and where I care about what happens. Avatar failed to provide this on any level.",3,5,8,10 July 2016
Psycho," Triumph of Fear
","What is so striking about Psycho is how much it differs from Hitchcock's usual stylish thrillers, even in his bleaker work like 'Vertigo'. Made with his TV crew, on a small budget and shot in black and white, the film shares more characteristics with noir and pulp than it does with his grand suspense pieces. In saying that, the film still delivers everything you would expect it to and more. It contains some of the most iconic imagery, characters and shocks ever put on screen. Being more terrifying than it had any right to be. It's Hitchcock holding the audience in the palm of his hand. And now it feels as if every important aspect of the film has become a big part of pop culture. The best word to describe the film is unnerving. From the moment the plot is set in motion the sense of dread never lets up. Said plot involves Marion Crane, a secretary who steals $40,000 from a slimy customer and leaves town. We get some insight into her actions, mainly her lover Sam having to pay his ex-wife alimony and their inability to marry as a result. It's a classic Hitchcock theme of a normal person caught up in crime. Marion isn't a bad person, just one forced to do something morally wrong which she later regrets. She stops off at the deserted Bates Motel and seems to get along with the quirky but seemingly pleasant owner Norman, which includes a fascinating dialogue scene in his parlour. However, the film turns on its head, as one event completely changes what we thought the film was initially about into something else entirely. Hitchcock's idea to kill off the leading lady barely halfway through proved to be a brave and ultimately inspired decision. It's a genius choice because it keeps the tension raised throughout. We know that if a main character can be axed off then surely nobody is safe. It is this thought process that provides the suspenseful moments with an added punch that makes them memorable and even more unsettling. They keep us constantly checking over each frame, afraid that anything might leap from the shadows and strike a killer blow. Playing with the audience's uncertainty and understanding just how powerful the feeling of unease can be. Bernard Herrmann's chilling, pulsating score weaves in and out of these scenes, adding even more layers of tension. Despite becoming famous for its sudden violence and shocks, the film has only a few moments that rely on startling the audience. Yet because these moments aren't overused they retain the fear factor. You see very little blood or wounds or gore that is usually associated with the genre. Most of the scares come from the imagery used and the way tension is built. A good example being the highway policeman who seemingly stalks Marion, with dark sunglasses leaving his face expressionless. The scene at the car dealership is truly frightening, the way in which he simply stares at her from across the street. It's pretty amazing how so much discomfort can be built from not only something so simple but someone who is meant to be a figure of good. He represents Marion's last chance to confess her crime, which would have ultimately saved her life. It shows how much we're invested in Marion's dilemma that we are terrified of her being caught.What always amazes me is just how well paced and executed the whole film is. There are long passages with minimal dialogue or plot development, where events play themselves out slowly and cautiously. And they remain effortlessly gripping throughout. A good example is Norman disposing of the body. Who'd of thought that a ten minute long sequence of cleaning up a murder scene could be so riveting? The film is deliberately sparse in that sense. A lot of time is devoted to building up the atmosphere and tension, giving us a feel of the characters and the environment that everything is taking place in. However, the dialogue heavy moments are just as engrossing. Any time Bates opens his mouth you can guarantee that something interesting will come out. The tense scene of him being grilled by detective Arbogast is a good example of that.You have Hitchcock's typical blondes in Janet Leigh as the reserved Marion and Vera Miles as her more inquisitive sister, both elegant and enjoyable to watch. But the truly fascinating character is definitely Norman Bates. What a wonderfully deranged individual. A man who appears to be controlled by his mother. You can tell instantly that something is not right with him. His quirky demeanour hides something disturbed lurking below. A great deal of that is down to Anthony Perkins superb performance. The things he captures complete the character, the way he moves, stammers, smiles, defends his mother, it's all perfectly done. This film very much becomes Norman's story, his actions are what keeps the plot moving forward. He ultimately becomes the character that everyone remembers.So what ends up making Psycho so memorable? I personally think it is down to how competently made and detailed it is. Hitchcock did something that many films of its ilk miss out on completely, he made the story, characters and scares all hold equal importance. The story is weaved perfectly, which in turn makes us feel something for the characters, and leads to the horror being so much more impactful. It is also the ultimate example of why atmosphere and tension will always beat gore and shock value on the scare scale. This is Hitchcock at the peak of his powers, working with a crew and cast that excel in every area and adding his own faultless direction to the mix. As a result it remains as powerful, gripping and terrifying as it has ever been.",9,0,1,16 July 2016
Hercules," No James Woods = No Good!
","If Disney were trying to keep their successful streak going then Hercules is a truly bizarre choice in trying to prolong that. On the surface a film based on Greek mythology could be very effective and if anybody could do an interesting take on it then it was probably Disney. However, the choices made in telling the story and shaping it are just so strange that I'm not sure what they were thinking. This very much feels like they were just throwing things at the wall and seeing what happened to stick. Almost everything clashes, from the animation to the music to comedy. This is one messy film and I don't think its good points are enough to redeem it.In a similar vein to Superman, Hercules is born to the Greek God Zeus on Mount Olympus and he happens to fall to Earth when a plan by Hades to dispose of him goes wrong. Hercules later discovers who he really is and sets out to earn his place back by being a hero, all while Hades tries to find out his weakness to complete a prophecy. This story has two big issues, the fact that we've seen this all before and that it is incredibly predictable. From the very beginning you know how the plot will develop, the motions that Hercules will go through and how it will all be resolved in the end. They try to add some different touches here and there, yet none of them really work and you're left with a tried plot line.The characters are pretty much cardboard cut-outs. Hercules (Tate Donovan) is the classic naive idiot who has a heart of gold and never gives up. Sadly he comes across as annoying instead of charming and he simply isn't interesting, he's a hero that you can't really get behind. His trainer Phil is the typical grumpy teacher, never satisfied and willing to give his student a hard time. Danny DeVito is a good fit, but he isn't given anything of note to do. Megara (Susan Egan) is enjoyably feisty and seems independent at first, but that is traded in so she becomes a damsel and the attempt to give her a solid backstory feels rushed. Hades' two servants Pain and Panic are much more irritating than they are funny too.The only thing that really works here is Hades with most of that coming from James Woods and his excellent delivery style. He talks like a salesman or a lawyer would, with very fluid snappy and frequently funny dialogue. He's enjoyably different from most Disney villains, mostly because he is a lot more charismatic and fast- talking. Not to mention he has a great design. On a similar point the rest of the animation, designed by Gerald Scarfe, is not that good. It all looks a little too soft and simplistic, with a lot of bright and rather in your face colours. I will say that some of the monster designs are quite creative, but I think they could have been even more imaginative. The action scenes weren't as good as they should have been either. There are a few moments of tension that are effective, but the fights are usually dull and not very engaging.I didn't enjoy the music at all. The main type of music used was Gospel and to me it didn't fit the film whatsoever. Seeing these images with a backdrop of Gospel was just so jarring, not to mention that the songs themselves were not very catchy. The Oscar-nominated 'Go the Distance' by Michael Bolton was weak too, the lyrics were rather clichéd and again it just didn't have a good tune. The comedy really didn't work. I found the 'muses' who interrupt from time to time to be annoying and all they did was slow the story down. I didn't care for the characters so the situational comedy wasn't that funny, there were very few humorous lines and the pop culture references felt like they were forced in. Once again Hades is the only one who is consistently amusing.For me Hercules is something of a failure. It feels like they were trying to capture the tone of Aladdin, but missed the fact that that film had engaging characters and much better jokes. Almost everything about Hercules doesn't work as it should or badly clashes. Hercules himself is just such a dull lead, the support he gets is equally as dull and the story has been seen so many times that it's become too familiar. Disney are usually great with music and animation, but both are weak here. I'd have to say that James Woods' Hades is probably the only shining light and does provide the best moments. Hercules is just a confused and boring effort.",3,8,22,14 October 2015
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Lavish, scary and engaging despite its problems.
","The Dracula novel has seen a ridiculously high amount of film adaptations. But if anyone could bring something new then it probably was acclaimed Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola made some very smart decisions when making the film, mainly deciding to stick closer to the book than most and paying many tributes to the iconic images seen in vampire films of old.The plot does stick quite close to the story. Young solicitor Jonathan Harker travels to Transylvania to sign over land to Count Dracula, who plans on coming to London to wreak havoc. However, upon seeing a picture of Harker's fiancé he believes her to be his old lover and attempts to win her heart. Although many dislike the added romance it does offer a lot and shows that Dracula does have some kind of soul, making the character more three dimensional. It also adds to the plot as it makes the film more than a struggle against a beast, but a struggle to win the heart of a person. While most argue that Dracula should be a cold monster, I think that it was a wise decision to offer a more sympathetic version as one hadn't been seen before at that point. I'm especially impressed with how the story juggled all of its elements so well, as the romance never felt forced and the scary stuff worked superbly.You can forget about Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee, as Gary Oldman steals the show with ease in an incredible performance as Dracula. He encompasses every single thing he needs to in order to make the role work, he can be both savage and creepy as well as humane and somewhat loving. Oldman made Dracula someone I feared but still felt sorry for , which is no simple task. He is still identifiable in a lot of make-up and the chilling accent is spot-on. Even the way he moves and expresses seem to have been worked to perfection. Should have won an Oscar in my book.The movies biggest stumbling block is with the acting however, seen with a trend of the support outshining the leads, bar Oldman, strangely. Sadie Frost puts a lot of energy in as the seductive Lucy and her feisty nature comes off well. Richard E. Grant is perfect for the part of Dr. Seward and plays the smart doctor well, even if he is underused. Both Cary Elwes and Billy Campbell do solid as can be jobs and make the most of their underdeveloped suitors. Tom Waits was also extremely enjoyable as the insane Renfield.The other three leads are the source of the films main problems for me. Keanu Reeves is horrifyingly bad here, there may actually be planks of wood that have more charisma than him. He is just so wooden in everything he does, his expressions don't convey any of the fear they should and his accent always sounds too fake to be convincing. Winona Ryder never truly convinces either. She just doesn't seem to know how to convey emotion properly and doesn't kind Mina the right depth, but she is just about acceptable. Anthony Hopkins just hams it up as Van Helsing and it comes across as ridiculous (He even humps Billy Campbell's leg at one point).Almost everything else in the film is spot-on. Coppola shot the film in extremely striking and attractive way, as almost every frame oozes richness. The effects are all in camera which is so impressive given the scale of some of them and they still look fantastic to this day, showing CGI isn't always needed. The costume design rightly won an Oscar. Everything fits the Victorian time frame perfectly and it looks beautiful as well as authentic. Dracula's many different costume are also outstanding. The locations look realistic as well, it really captures the gloominess of Victorian London and the makes Transylvania look like a creepy place.The scary scenes were just that and I'd say the film can boast some of the most wildly scary images of any horror centred film since the 80's. The film carries a very Gothic and eerie atmosphere that allows the scary moments to develop more, this is very apparent in the sequences in the castle which are really creepy. Dracula's frequent monstrous forms are demonic and frightening, they are also really well designed and add to terrifying aspects of the character physically. Other times when the film captures a classic horror feel are seen with Harker's encounter of the Brides and the confrontation with Dracula, which both rely on mood to produce terror and it works wonderfully.A lot of praise has to be given to Wojciech Kilar who composes one of the greatest scores I've ever heard. Kilar manages to create a score that has the absolute perfect balance of bone chilling and sweeping beauty. The music feels like it is coming alive at times and enhances certain scenes ten-fold. It is too great to really put into words, but it's one of the few soundtracks that can make you paranoid with fear as well as make you shed a tear of sadness. So does Coppola succeed in making the ideal Dracula movie? I'm going to have to say yes. Whilst I can see that there are aspects people won't enjoy, mainly the romantic sub-plot and some of the poor acting, the film has an extremely high amount of excellent features. The production design, effects and score are some of the very best you will see in film, and visually the film is still a magnificent achievement. It also achieves many of its aims, Gary Oldman is a superb Dracula, the scary moments are very scary and it sticks very close to the book. It may not be the perfect film, but it is extremely well made and very memorable.",8,1,3,29 October 2013
Dark Shadows," Solid but slightly wasted effort from Burton & Depp
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp team up once again, and the results produce something of a mixed bag. The partnership between the two started off well, but lost steam thanks to poor efforts like 'Charlie and The Chocolate Factory' and 'Alice in Wonderland' remakes. Dark Shadows falls into the middle for both. The film, an adaption of the Gothic soap opera, does have a lot of good things whilst also failing in much of what it attempts. There was a lot of potential for a really great movie, and that might be what makes the film come off as somewhat disappointing.The film focuses on Barnabas Collins, a 200-year-old vampire whose family once ran the local fishing port. He rises after being imprisoned for two centuries to find his modern relatives and business in a state of disarray. Collins also discovers that the witch who cursed and imprisoned him has taken over the towns fishing business. He quickly sets about to improve the family, get used to his new surroundings and lift the curse upon him. The plot does have an interesting set-up and some smart ideas. The major issue with the story, and most of the film, is that it strongly lacks focus. It is like Burton doesn't know what area to concentrate on and that makes it come across as messy. Not enough time is spent on the family, the love interest, the business or Barnabas himself for you to truly care.The point that film lacks focus is what lets it down. It would have made much more sense to, for example, focus on Barnabas' interactions with family than just jump for one piece to another. This made the whole love aspect with Victoria seem slightly forced and meant that the relationship with Angelique was not as fleshed out as it could have been. The same issue applies in genre choices. Dark Shadows is unable to decide whether it is a comedy, horror or straight-up drama. It has successful elements of all three genres, but these elements could have been used much better if it picked one and went with it. The constant genre hopping once again harms the films instead of improving it.Despite many blasting Johnny Depp's performance as the vampire lead, I don't think he does a bad job. He looks great under the heavy make-up and he brings some quirky mannerisms to the role that fit in rather well. His delivery of certain lines and expressions are just naturally funny. The character is not that well written, so Depp deserves some applause for being so entertaining. The rest of the cast sadly feel somewhat wasted. Michelle Pfeiffer was enjoyable as she usually is as the head of the family, but she isn't given enough material to work with. Jackie Earle Haley is very funny as the surly Collins caretaker and easily gets some of the funniest pieces of the movie. Eva Green does a good job as the greedy witch, but she needed to be fleshed out more. Bella Heathcote is decent as the wide- eyed Victoria, but again the role needed some more focus to really work. I didn't enjoy Chloe Grace Moretz as Carolyn, she makes the angst teen act comes off as very annoying and doesn't feel natural. Jonny Lee Miller and Helena Bonham Carter are solid yet easy to forget thanks to their bland characters.The film does have some things going for it. I found Barnabas' struggle to adapt to the 1970's very amusing. Arguably the funniest parts of the movie are him trying to fit in with this new society and how his old- fashioned puts people off as well as intrigues them. Angelique's sexual pursuit of Barnabas leads to a few funny exchanges between the two. Even Barnabas' awkward attempts to gain Victoria's love were humorous. As said, if the film put more effort into the comedy then it could have been very funny. The comedy is there but it is in Burton's typical slightly campy and slightly dark style, which if you like then you'll enjoy here.Visually it is stunning, Tim Burton creates another film that is vividly rich to view thanks to the modern and Gothic elements that are used. The cinematography manages to capture the serene but dark beauty of the area perfectly and the look of the 1970s is nicely realised. The Collins mansion also looks wonderful, the Gothic architecture and gloomy secret passages bring the place to life. The costumes are fantastic too, especially Barnabas' look which conveys the Gothic style of the film just right. The music was a mixed bag. Danny Elfman's subdued score was effective in certain areas, but also a little lifeless in others. I don't think that Elfman's more quirky styling's fit the film that well. I actually found that some of the music used fit in quite well, song like 'Top of the World' and 'Nights in White Satin' managed to sound authentic thanks to the setting. Even a cameo by Alice Cooper was used effectively and produced some nostalgic fun.I don't think Dark Shadows is a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, certainly not as bad as people have made it out to be. It is entertaining and is the type of film that is easy to watch at any time. Visually it is wonderful and Johnny Depp is effortlessly engaging. However, it is its limitations that hold it back, the unfocused plot line, shallow characters and the constant genre hopping do nothing but harm the films true intentions. I think this is more of a case of wasted potential than a truly poor effort. With Burton at the helm of what seems like his ideal type of film you cannot help be feel a bit let-down. The shadows are here but they do not hide anything we haven't seen before.",6,0,0,31 January 2014
The Lion King," Very good, But not Disney's best like everyone claims
","The Lion King is viewed by most as the peak in Disney's renaissance period and remains, to this date, the highest grossing 2D animated film of all time. With Disney on such a high expectations were, while this was increased by the superb vocal talent and wonderful animation, and for many those expectations were met. Though a lot are going to disagree with me, I have to come out and say that I think the film is kind of overrated. That doesn't mean I dislike it as a matter of fact I agree that it does have fantastic elements, but for the heaps of praise it gets I'm not sure if it holds up well enough.The story is effectively a toned down Hamlet. A lion prince named Simba is born, meaning that his cruel uncle Scar is now second in line to the throne. Scar plots to kill both King Mufasa and Simba, succeeding in killing Mufasa and making Simba believe he was at fault. Simba flees the kingdom and remains in exile for a number of years, until figures of the past challenge him and he must return home to take his rightful place as king. The story is a very interesting one, it is a much more mature than you would expect from Disney and I really enjoy it for that reason. Everything that happens seems to happen for a reason and there isn't any filler as far as the plot goes. After all this is a very big story and telling it in a cohesive mature manner works very well.The other impressive feature is the animation. It's clear that the animators put a lot of work in to create such a visually pleasing place for this to all happen in. The colours used give the place such a bright beautiful look and it is actually quite authentic looking too. Scenes of bird flying over the vivid landscape or of the sun shining over the land are so beautiful to look at. The character designs were also very good, like the contrast between the powerful Mufasa and the slimy Scar. The sheer scope of things is another wonderful aspect, such as when Scar's paw first comes down or the later Wildebeest stampede. Even things like the backgrounds look massive which gives an extra size to this world.The characters are rather hit and miss. Simba is a bit of a bland lead, he is just a kid for most of it but he does come off as a bit too boring and even obnoxious at times. He doesn't get any better the older he gets and Matthew Broderick's voice only adds to the dullness. Mufasa is just a brilliant character. He is designed wonderfully, has some really interesting characteristics and James Earl Jones' booming voice is perfect for it. A lot of people rate Scar as a top villain yet for me he's just decent. He is enjoyably devious and Jeremy Irons clearly has fun with the role, but he does come off as not that smart and a bit snivelling in the end. Zazu is very funny with Rowan Atkinson delivering some good lines and Rafiki is also very likable for coming across as a good friend. I'm not a big fan of Timon and Pumbaa as they come off as a bit annoying and wink at the camera too much, though they do have some amusing scenes. The Hyenas were daft but entertaining, while I think Nala was underplayed too much.I do have issues with the film. The message that it is trying to get across is an interesting one in how we must learn from the past to move forward. The problem is that when Simba confronts his past nobody believes him until Scar says what really happened. Looking at this you can't help but feel Simba would have been better off lying and that harms the whole point of the message. Also I think a lot of the comedic elements feel very misplaced. For a story as grand and serious as this I can't help but find that the comedy is too trivial at times which is distracting. As mentioned Timon and Pumbaa just feel a bit misplaced because they're jokes are slightly too silly. If done well, like with Zazu or the hyenas antics, then its nice relief but otherwise it doesn't work.Also I really find that the songs are a mixed bag. 'I Just Can't Wait to be King' and 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' just come off as your typical pop songs and there isn't anything truly catchy or memorable about them. 'Hakuna Matata' is another one everyone loves, but for me it's just annoying. On the other hand however, 'Circle of Life' is a brilliantly grand number that opens the film perfectly and 'Be Prepared' is really catchy with some very enjoyable singing from Jeremy Irons. Elsewhere there are some really memorable sequences here. The circle of life opening is something that everyone should remember, the wildebeest chase is visually stunning as well as pulse-pounding, Simba talking to Mufasa in the clouds is sadly beautiful and the final battle sequence does have some great images. Also I thought it was very brave decision to actually show the body of Mufasa after his death. In fact going on from that the movie does have a very strong emotional core running throughout that is very welcoming and smartly used.On the whole I do think that The Lion King is a very accomplished piece from Disney, I just don't find it as engaging as most people do. This is a big story with a lot of big elements, I just find that whilst most of the work some of them aren't quite as successful. I do wish other Disney films were as acclaimed as The Lion King, but I still find an entertaining and well-made film.",7,6,10,10 February 2014
The Conjuring," Don't believe the 'truth'!
","The Conjuring is a film I've been interested in seeing for a while and the vast majority of reviews were claiming that it's one of the scariest films of the last 20 years. A story about paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren could be excellent. Well all I can say is don't believe the hype. This is easily one of the most overrated horror films in a long time, and why is that? Because it simply repeats the same formula and scares that have been hammered to death in other recent films of this kind or done much better back in the 70's/80's. The terrifying images and sense dread people were talking about are completely absent and I must have been watching a different film to them. All I saw were creaking floorboards, bad Exorcist make-up and the ultimate annoyance of the jump scare. The problem with many recent horror films is that they simply can't build up suspense or terror properly and therefore rely on shock value or jump scares, and neither of those things are that scary when you think about them. The 'scares' here are so predictable that I was guessing them with ease. The camera lingers on something in the dark, something goes BANG! very loudly and then it cuts away. It does this over and over again, how on Earth is that scary? The story starts off interestingly enough, if a little slow, whilst never straying too far from the haunted house formula, but the final third descends into chaos and nonsense.The climax itself clearly rips off The Exorcist and Poltergeist. The reveal of reason for the haunting was a massive let down as well. I can't find many faults in the cinematography as the film looked fantastic for the most part and letting it in 1971 was a very nice touch. The acting was fine too. Patrick Wilson is always solid and Vera Farmiga was good while they made a believable couple. The family were decent and the young girls were all believable too, though Lili Taylor's appearance should have rung alarm bells seeing as she also starred in that horrid remake of The Haunting. The music was okay, but it felt like it was trying to scary you with dissonance rather than add to the mood. The reviews saying this is scary beyond belief are nonsense and those people seriously need to watch more horror films of yesteryear. Tip to the film-makers, jump scares are not scary whatsoever when they are overused like they are here. The Conjuring is a let-down in every sense of the word.",3,3,5,3 November 2015
Halloween," How to do a Horror Film
","John Carpenter's Halloween stands up in modern day as one of the most creative and unsettling horror films of all time. It first showcased Carpenter as a director that can make a cheap film look a million bucks and one who can craft an incredibly creepy atmosphere simply by what he decides to show, methods he would continue to use to such great effect in his later films. Despite so many films trying to copy its style and the 'slasher' sub-genre becoming popular in its wake, the film continues to comfortably standout from the crowd. It isn't gory or visually grotesque because the majority of the horror is left to what you can only imagine and that is where the scares come from. For such a simple story the film is enhanced by technical expertise, believable acting and a director who knows exactly what he is doing.The idea of a crazed killer returning to his home town and killing off innocent people is pretty much the entire premise. It is a credit to the film that it uses this concept so successfully. Michael Myers randomly stalks teenager Laurie Strode and picks off her friends as they babysit, while we get very little insight into Myers' character (apart from a chillingly shot flashback to when he was a child) and this is actually one of the things that makes him so scary. He's a blank-faced killer and we have no idea what motivates him or if he will ever stop. He seems to be able to withstand great pain and the way in which his psychiatrist talks about him only adds to his threat.For me what really makes the film so chilling is how it takes place in such a normal, quiet town to such believable people. A fair amount of the film takes place in broad daylight and the characters get quite a few glimpses of the killer, which shows you just how unnerving it is that darkness and shadows aren't always needed. The film understands what is truly scary, seeing glimpses of Myers slowly disappearing behind a bush or being in a garden one moment and gone the next are so much more disturbing than any amount of blood or gore. It's the sense of unease because both the audience and the characters don't know his motivations. The increasing sense of danger throughout the film as it builds is done masterfully.The two main performances from Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence are both superb. A lot hinges on them given their key roles in the story and both deliver. Curtis is perfect as the soft- spoken, high school girl Laurie because she brings such believability to the role. She convinces you immediately that she's just normal teenager and that makes her struggle all the more terrifying. Pleasence is always a gripping screen presence and as Dr. Loomis he is excellent. Loomis is the only person that has any understanding of Myers, as Pleasence sells the sense of panic in his delivery and expressions alone. Both Nancy Kyes and P.J Soles as Laurie friends help add to the credibility given their grounded performances.As noted Carpenter's directing is absolutely fantastic here. He masters the art of simplicity, keeping the movements appropriately basic and making everything that happens in the first half play on the mind of the viewer. He knows what to show and when, because you rarely see much blood in the film despite its premise. The dialogue is done very well. The way in which these girls talk to each other and interact with the children is so naturalistic, adding more and more to the genuine tone that the film carries. The score by Carpenter himself deserves a special mention. The main theme has rightfully become iconic and it fits the film perfectly, the spidery piano notes and icy synth adding to the eerie atmosphere.For me Halloween is certainly one of the best horror films of its time. Not just for its ability to strike a sense of fear into people, but for how smartly it is crafted and how it understands where the scares come from. I think that is something most horror films (especially those in the slasher or stalker area) seem to forget. The idea that someone might be behind you but you don't know it or that you're powerless against something that won't stop is so much scarier that someone being tortured or carved open. Carpenter really set himself as a master of the genre (which we would later see again in a different way in The Thing) thanks to his great directing, while the acting and writing are both top notch which add to the terror unfolding. It shows that less can be more.",8,8,11,25 March 2016
Iron Man," Stainless style
","Iron Man is effectively the film that sparked life back into the superhero genre. Being Marvel studios first solo film there was a lot riding on the film to be a success and allow the company to bring more comic book heroes to the big screen. Having Jon Favreau direct and giving Robert Downey Jr. a chance to continue his career revival as the titular hero were brave choices, but also ones which pay-off in the best way possible. Downey Jr. pretty much takes control of the film and breathes life into what could have been a dull hero. Most of all Iron Man succeeds where it needs to and offers exactly what the audiences wants with fun characters, exciting action and plenty of witty lines.Story: Billionaire playboy Tony Stark is in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile built by his weapons company. He is attacked and captured by a terrorist group, only surviving because an electromagnet is fused into his chest. He escapes by secretly building and powering a suit of armour via the magnet, which he decides to put to greater use upon his return. As far as origin stories go this is extremely well done. It plays it safe in certain areas, but it is played out with such style that it is easy to forgive. We get plenty of insights into Stark's past, who his friends are and solid reasoning as to how he came to be. I also liked how terrorism was a major theme throughout, giving the characters actions much more weight than usual.Hero: It feels like Robert Downey Jr. was born to play this role and he is succeeds in every way possible. It's all the more impressive given the difficult job of making Stark someone who is sardonic and arrogant, whilst also being charming and courageous. He handles every aspect of the role brilliantly, offering plenty of laughs and being someone you grow to care about.Villains: Jeff Bridges does a solid job as usual as Stark's scheming business partner Obadiah Stane. He does come off as a little one note and it is obvious he'll be evil from the get good, but Bridges charismatic portrayal makes the role more engaging and he does get a few enjoyably sinister moments. Faran Tahir also does a fine job with a limited role as terrorist leader Raza.Support: Gwyneth Paltrow is a mixed bag as Stark's assistant Pepper Potts. She certainly has chemistry with Downey Jr. and has some amusing lines, yet she just didn't seem at ease with much of the dialogue and wasn't that believable in the role. Terrence Howard puts in a solid performance as Stark's air force ally Rhodes. He definitely convinces as a military presence and his scenes with Downey Jr. are fun, but the role just isn't fleshed out that much. Paul Bettany provides the voice of computer Jarvis and gives the right amount of flair to the snappy dialogue.Action: The action is straight-forward and yet surprisingly effective. We get plenty of shots of Iron Man soaring across the skies and him blowing things up, with it all being shot in a very stylish way that makes it more effective than it should be. Importantly it never forgets to keep things exciting and there are some well-timed moments of humour. The climax is mainly two men in metal trying to crush each other, but even that was a lot of fun and shot with an appropriate intensity. The CGI is mostly excellent and blends in very well.Music: The score by Ramin Djawadi is based much more in hard rock and consistently excellent. The heavy guitar should isn't used much in films and that helps it standout here, giving a lot of attitude to certain scenes and helping give the film its own identity. The music when Stark first tries out the suit is pulse pounding in all the right ways.Production: Firstly the film does look fantastic. Everything is appropriately slick and stylish, but without overdoing it and that helps to retain a greater sense of realism. Setting it in California was also a nice idea seeing as we've seen so many superheroes based on the west coast and it does take advantage of the area with many scenic shots. The script is well written for the most part and most scenes flow along smoothly. The humour is brilliantly placed throughout and works mainly due to Downey Jr.'s superb delivery, whilst always managing to walk the fine line between subtle and slapstick. It's good to see a superhero that doesn't spend most of the film moping around and actually embraces what he has, it's not like that's a bad thing but it is always pleasant to see something different.Conclusion: For me Iron Man works so well because it gives the audience the perfect mixture of thrills and laughs that it appeared it would. Robert Downey Jr. is undoubtedly the star of the show and his charismatic portrayal of someone as flawed as Stark makes for the perfect centre of the film. Beyond that the action is always exciting, the score is a lot of fun and the writing is great throughout. The film suffers slightly from some plot predictability and some of the characters not being overly engaging, but they are only minor setbacks. Importantly it's easy to see why Iron Man helped launch Marvel as a cinematic force, it succeeds in making its superhero both fun and serious when he needs to be.",6,0,2,15 November 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," An Absolute Mess
","After being bored to death by the bland Man of Steel, my expectations for the first cinematic clash of DC's biggest icons were low with good reason. With Snyder back at the helm I was concerned it would be style over substance yet again, continuing the confused writing that crippled Man of Steel and not understanding its characters motivations. Sadly my low expectations weren't even meet. Batman v Superman is one of the most incoherent and poorly written films I have seen in a long time, with a plot that seems to be making things up as it goes along and characters that have no relatability or motivation. Story: After Superman destroyed most Metropolis he is considered a danger to the population and the returning Batman believes he needs to be killed. Meanwhile Lex Luthor finds pieces of Kryptonite and uses it to create a weapon that could defeat Superman. Sounds simple enough, but the film is so convoluted it's hard to get your head around it. There are senate hearings, Batman trying to steal the Kryptonite, Lois Lane trying to defend Superman, Luthor wanting Superman dead for no reason and a mysterious figure who we find out is Wonder Woman. It's all crowbarred into the film and absolutely none of it is given enough screen time to make sense. Worst of all is that the entire central conflict (a good 2/3's of the film) is completely resolved because both of their mothers are called Martha, well what a small world it is after all.Heroes: Ben Affleck is comfortably the best thing here as the Dark Knight. He not only looks fantastic, but has the intensity and delivery that lends itself perfectly to the role. It's just a shame that his Batman is written so badly. Henry Cavill is as bland as ever as Superman. He's just boring to watch and he has a blank expression on his face for the entire film, added to that Superman just comes off as uncaring and stupid because of his perplexing decision making. Villains: Jesse Eisenberg wins the award for most irritating over-acting in the history of cinema. Whoever cast him as Luthor should never work again. He was literally a manic mix of Jim Carrey's the Riddler, Cesar Romero's Joker and Rain Man times ten. His delivery was painful, every so often he'd be whispering to himself like someone at the old folk's home, and by the climax he's just a raving nerdy lunatic. I hated every moment he was on screen. Doomsday shows up at the end as an excuse to level some more buildings and that all there is to him. Support: Lois Lane is as dull as dishwater again. There is no reason for her to be here and her actions are solely put in for her to do something. An aging and very bland Amy Adams makes it worse. Gal Gadot shows up as Wonder Woman for all of ten minutes and she's leaves no impression though she looks good. The likes of Jeremy Irons and Diane Lane do okay with what their given.Action: The main fight between the two heroes is effective and appropriately hard-hitting, with some great angles and an intense atmosphere. The Batman fights are actually well done and as you'd imagine he'd fight. However, the climactic battle is action overkill. It's exactly the same as the Man of Steel ending, just buildings being flattened and shots that make it hard to tell what's going on. Music: Hans Zimmer's score is so generic it's painful. There is no main theme to speak of. It contains his usual big horn sound that has been done to death and the throbbing synths, but it's nothing new and just gets lost in the mix.Production: The editing is some of the worst I have ever seen. Scenes begin and end on a whim, there's too many fade to blacks to count, flashbacks and dream sequences come out of nowhere, we jump from location to location with no rhyme or reason and scenes that seem to be building to something end with no resolution. It is truly horrendous. There's no levity throughout, it's just dark and grim for the sake of it. Snyder isn't the type of director that can make dialogue engaging and it shows here, bar the scenes with Bruce and Alfred I was bored stiff because none of the lines seemed exciting or interesting. For the most part we're just watching people babble on about nothing in particular. The shoe-horning in of the Justice League characters is awkwardly done and stinks of studio interference. The character writing is mind-numbingly bad. Batman is effectively on a murderous rampage the whole film, Superman doesn't even hint at feeling anything for other human beings and Luthor has no reason whatsoever to want Superman dead. None of the characters thoughts or feelings are examined or discussed, so we are left with blank slates whose actions carry no weight. Conclusion: To call the film a mess is a massive understatement because above all else it's a film that doesn't have a coherent plot line and simply doesn't even understand its own characters. Nothing that happens makes any sense, these characters are incredibly dull or annoying and we don't know a thing about them bar what is presented on the surface. The title conflict is a joke, taking up most of the film only to be resolved in seconds and then we get a mini team up that ends on a truly baffling note. None of the main actor's bar Affleck are remotely engaging (Eisenberg is nauseating), the fight scenes are mixed at best, the dialogue is poor, the plot is incredibly incoherent and Snyder simply can't do anything well other than action overkill. It's a real shame that such iconic characters first time on screen together had to be in this mess.",2,11,21,3 April 2016
Monsters University," Effectively Monsters, Inc. meets Animal House
","Monsters University saw Pixar return to familiar territory after the disappointing Cars 2 and Brave, becoming the first prequel to come from the studio. The idea of showing how Mike and Sulley first meet was one that held a lot of potential, and the success of the film depends on what you are expecting. The film isn't a fast-paced adventure with a lot at stake like the first film, but more of an amusing origin story that's just good fun. It focuses on Mike going to Monsters University with the intention of being the best scarer ever and he clashes with the overconfident Sulley as a result. When they are kicked off the course they are forced to enter the Scaring Games to get their places back and guide a team of misfits to success along the way.The story is as simple as its sounds, it's just Mike and Sulley trying to win the competition and gradually realising that they're both after the same thing. It is nice that they weren't originally friends and had to work together to fully understand each other. The real strength of the story lies with its moral. The idea that someone's abilities can always surprise you is on that the film uses very effectively, seeing as Mike is constantly told that he is scary enough and no amount of hard work will change that. Of course by the climax he proves that by mixing his knowledge with Sulley's look anything can be achieved. Away from that is does follow the formula of a typical university movie and the hijinks of the fraternities, but it does it well and offers a lot of enjoyment. The only issue people may have with the story is that there feels like there is less at stake. There is conflict, especially in the climax, but there is no big adventure you come to expect from Pixar. As always the characters are crucial to this story and they are great. Mike is portrayed as bookish and relying on his quick wit, but he is a lot of fun. You get a real sense of how much he wants to be successful and it's difficult not to like him simply because of the passion he shows. Sulley is much more self-assured and lackadaisical towards his career than he would go on to be, though he does go through an arch as he becomes more attentive and reliable as the film progresses. The geeky frat group they join all have distinct personalities. Squishy is a pleasant innocent, Don is an enjoyable fatherly figure and Art provides some good laughs because of how odd he is. The frightening Dean (voiced well by Helen Mirren) makes a good adversary to the group and has a great design, even if she is underdeveloped. The rival frat groups suffer from the same problem.The animation is brilliant and extremely detailed. It's very colourful and bright, giving a lot of life to the university setting and allowing the characters to leap off the screen. The character designs are excellent and creative, no two monsters look the same and it's clear that a lot of thought went into their looks. The score by Randy Newman is very good. It has the light feel of the original film yet involves less jazzy elements and more infectious melodies, the songs used throughout the film also fit well. The scare games were inventive and provided a great deal of excitement that the film needed, with the final game allowing a lot of tension. The jokes themselves are somewhat hit and miss. In fairness to the film there is a wide variety of comedy and so many comedic styles are tried that it was bound to be the case, though when the jokes are good they are usually very funny thanks to some great visuals and wordplay.So while it isn't up there with Pixar's greats, Monsters University is an extremely enjoyable and always entertaining effort. It does lack the big feel of other Pixar films and is a little by the book in some areas, but the film succeeds at what it attempts to do and that is tell a fun buddy college film. The two main characters are very likable and that remains the case throughout, they carry the film with relative ease. The other characters are entertaining, the animation is some of the studios most colourful and the message is a very genuine one that's handled well. Even for the often patchy comedy, when the comedic moments work they work very well. It's a film that is easy to appreciate and get a lot of enjoyment out of.",7,0,0,27 January 2016
Casino Royale," Bond at its best
","Bond Review. Title: Fleming's first Bond novel and straight to the point.Pre-Titles: We see Bond acquire his double 0 status, firstly by brutally killing a contact in a bathroom and then killing an MI6 traitor named Dryden. This is a fantastic way to reintroduce the character and its great seeing how Bond got his licence to kill. It's very stylishly shot in black and white, with the bathroom fight being brilliantly vicious and the talk with Dryden is suitably intense.Theme Song: Chris Cornell's 'You Know My Name' is a hard hitting, rocky effort that fits in perfectly. Its urgent melody and more aggressive stylings suit the tone of the film effortlessly, while Cornell's passionate vocals are excellent and even the lyrics are memorable.Plot: Terrorist banker Le Chiffre takes part in a poker game in Montenegro in order to win back finances he lost. Bond is sent to participate in the game along with a treasury agent and prevent Le Chiffre from winning, while he quickly learns that he can't trust anyone. The storyline flows excellently, taken straight from the book and updated in the perfect way. What I really like is the amount of build-up without it being overlong. We see Bond in a variety of countries and doing a variety of assignments, so the main plot point is given weight and we feels its importance.James Bond: Daniel Craig makes a near perfect debut here. He plays Bond here as aggressive and intelligent but somewhat edgy and vulnerable. None of these clash and Craig manages to form a very interesting character. He has plenty of charisma and is surprisingly effective in the lighter scenes. His only flaw is that he doesn't fit the traditional image.Bond Girls: Eva Green does a wonderful job as Bond's partner Vesper. She has such a strong screen presence as ever emotion and expression feels so believable. She is attractive but not in the usual glamorous way which is nice and has very good chemistry with Craig. Caterina Murino does a solid job as Solange. Its short, but she plays an interesting part and is very convincing. Villains: Mad Mikkelsen is great as Le Chiffre. He has an interesting look and a menacing presence but in a much more grounded way than usual. His motivations are believable and his dialogue is memorable without sounding too clichéd, while his rivalry with Bond is very enjoyable. Jesper Christensen does a good job as the mysterious Mr. White. We never know what his incentives are or who he works for and his appearances are always interesting.Support: Judi Dench is excellent once again as M, as her chemistry with Craig is especially good and it feels like there is a genuine connection between the two. Giancarlo Giannini is brilliant as Bond's contact Mathis. He's a warm presence and his charming persona brings some much needed humour. Jeffrey Wright does a solid job as CIA man Felix Leiter.Action: The action is fast-paced with a much needed vicious edge. The action feels real and that is where it succeeds. The parkour chase through a construction site is one of the best action scenes in the entire series, with incredible stunt work and a pounding intensity that doesn't let up. The fight at Miami airport is almost as good, again featuring a genuine tension that works so well. The stairwell fight is possibly the most brutal in the series and the famous torture scene is excellently done. The climax might seem a bit cluttered, but it is effective and shot very well.Score: David Arnold offers another fantastic score. He doesn't change his work massively, but he adds some lovely subtle pieces for the slower scenes and many truly intense pieces for the action. He again succeeds in getting the balance just right.Production Values: Like in GoldenEye, Martin Campbell does a great directing job because he knows where to keep the focus. He keeps it all simple and given the films tone that works to its advantage. With that said there are many memorable and beautiful shots throughout. The writing is superb. This is probably the most real a Bond film has ever been, all the characters are fleshed out, they have their own intricacies and the pressures of Bond's job is addressed a lot. It doesn't shy away from the truly brutal, but it remembers to add some humour and keep things entertaining. The stunt work is truly excellent, with most of it looking realistic and Craig himself handles the action very well. As stated the way the plot is built up is fantastic and as this is played as Bond's first major assignment it is fun to see him learn the trade. The locations are all wonderful and well varied, from the tropics of The Bahamas to the lovely architecture of Eastern Europe.Conclusion: Casino Royale is a return to basics and arguably the best Bond film since the early Connery days. It has possibly the best balance of the series with plenty of action, well formed characters, smart dialogue, great locations and a gripping story whilst always being entertaining. Daniel Craig is the shining light and he absorbs all the most fascinating aspects of the character. Eva Green is one of the best female leads, Le Chiffre is a different kind of villain and the action is really effective. Martin Campbell breathed life into the series for a second time and it seems like every part was done to its best ability.",8,3,10,29 July 2015
Beowulf," I will kill your Monstah!!!
","Everyone knows the story of Beowulf, one of the oldest poems ever written. So Robert Zemeckis certainly had his work cut out to make a film that was both entertaining for modern audiences and still paid tribute to its original source. Zemeckis deciding to film in Motion- Capture again, after the iffy results of The Polar Express, was another brave move. The film did have me questioning certain aspects beforehand, would the Motion-Capture work? Could it avoid becoming another typical action movie? And why Cockney hardman Ray Winstone as the Swedish hero? Making the whole thing work and pay off would be a huge achievement.The follows the poem as warrior Beowulf and his men travel to Denmark to rid a kingdom of the monster Grendel. After Beowulf manages to kill the creature, he learns that its mother is still wreaking havoc and goes to her lair in order to kill her. However, once there he makes a bargain with her to become king and bare her 'son' that will have terrible aftereffects. The film deserves massive credit for managing to extend the story without diluting it, something that concerned me prior. The more time means that more characters are developed and become more interesting the longer things go along, especially Beowulf and the Queen. The things involving Grendel and his Mother are great, the older thoughtful Beowulf offers good insight into the man and the climax, with a Dragon, is superb.The Motion-Capture is a main talking point and, thankfully, it is excellent. There have clearly been developments in the field as the zombie-like expressions have gone and everything is even closer to real life. The characters are brilliantly designed, for example Grendel looks truly monstrous and Beowulf himself is excellently rendered. The characters a look very lifelike and have close similarities to their actors, all except for Beowulf himself. Seeing as he is played by a burly Winstone they make him more athletic looking and he ends up resembling Sean Bean, which sounds strange but works perfectly well. The details are fantastic, the scenery looks beautiful in all its snow covered glory. A lot of work clearly went into making the backdrop look authentic and it really is visually stunning at times. The use of snow and sunshine looks extremely realistic as they add to the visual spectacle. Certain visual aspects like the injuries and Beowulf's battles are really well stylised, never being too goofy and always looking very effective. But could Ray Winstone succeed as Beowulf? The answer is a strong yes. In theory the Cockney Winstone shouldn't work. Yet it does, as he possesses excellent charisma and there is an understated intensity to his performance that makes things click. The Cockney accent creeps in at times, such as when he shouts 'I will kill your monstah!', but for the most part he tones it down and does sound like a tough warrior. Here is where Winstone proved that he does have some amount of versatility and he shows he do a great job at the forefront of the film. The other performances are extremely good. Anthony Hopkins offers his usual hammy turn as the under pressure King, though given the tone of the film this actually works okay and he is entertaining. Brendan Gleeson gives a solid turn as Beowulf's right-hand man, John Malkovich is effective in his backing role and Robin Wright is excellent once again as the sombre queen, showing once more that she is a brilliant actress. Crispin Glover adds touches of sadness and sympathy to the monstrous Grendel. The animation on him looks great and his soft tongue reflects his brutal actions well. Angelina Jolie shows up as the beasts Mother and spends a lot of time with little clothing on. Despite her short appearance she portrays the seductive and cruel creature excellently.Another hotly discussed aspect is the rating, and I agree with the general view. How the hell did this get a 12 certificate? The violence is truly brutal. We actually see Grendel ripping people in half, blood pouring out of wounds and arms being sliced clean off. Not to mention that there are a lot of sexual references and some very scary moments. Just because it isn't real-life doesn't tone it down. I do enjoy the viciousness as its ads to the films impact, but the rating is just wrong.The action scenes are impressive, as I've alluded to. Beowulf's battle with Grendel is intense and has some pounding action, even if him fighting in the bluff is a bit distracting. The climax involving a dragon is excellent, containing plenty of pulsating action and edge of your set thrills. Even the drama hits the right spot, the scenes of the older Beowulf and the focus on the Queen leads to a lot of interesting moments. Elsewhere regular Zemeckis collaborator Alan Silvestri delivers the goods again with another top notch score, it has the right amount of intensity and melancholy to fit the film.I'm actually happy that Beowulf passed my expectations. It answered concerns over expanding the story and the idea of Ray Winstone as the man exceptionally. Some may question why the film wasn't just shot in live action, but I think that the Motion-Capture adds to the films uniqueness and does allow for many wonderful visual moments. The film itself does show that Motion-Capture can add a lot to a film instead of taking away from it. Don't be expecting a perfect adaption because it's not that type of film. The acting is excellent, the action sequences are thrilling and the visuals are truly something to behold. It is a thoroughly entertaining film.",7,3,4,16 December 2013
Cinderella," A pleasant Disney effort
","Cinderella is widely seen as an iconic film. Not only did its success help save Disney from financial collapse, but it also crafted some memorable imagery and established themes that would reoccur in Disney's fairy tales. Most people know the story. Cinderella is effectively a slave to her cruel stepmother and her chance to escape appears when every maiden in the land is invited to the Prince's ball in order to find him a wife. She attends, with help from her Fairy Godmother, and falls in love with the Prince, but leaves only a glass slipper behind for him to find her. I think the simplicity of the story is what appeals to people, while its themes of perseverance and triumphing over adversity are also used effectively.Cinderella herself is not the most interesting of characters, she's pleasant and sweet but she's also a little boring. Yet her kindness is what wins you over, the fact she's always so upbeat and optimistic in the face of such hardship makes her a very likable lead. Some people might have problems with how passive she seems at times, but it adds to the characters sensitivity for me. I also think Ilene Woods has a very gentle voice that matches the character flawlessly. Sadly the Prince gets even less development and comes off as a total bore. He only has a few lines of dialogue and we never know how he feels, he appears disinterested in the ball and as a result the romance with Cinderella just feels weak. The animation is excellent and softer which calls back to the likes of 'Snow White'. However, the most impressive thing about the film visually is its size. This is one big film with every castle and every mansion looking massive, in fact the scenes at the Prince's ball are amazing in scope considering the films ages. The colours are bright and bring a lot of warmth to proceedings, with lots of blue and pink that blend together beautifully with the background. The music is good for the most part and there are plenty of pleasant melodies that suit the films tone, while songs like 'Bibbidi- Bobbidi-Boo' are bouncy and enjoyable.Possibly the best element for me is the stepmother Lady Tremaine. She is comfortably one of Disney's best villains and it all comes from her having control over Cinderella. She comes across as calculating and spiteful, always looking to make Cinderella's life miserable with an icy glare and air of superiority. Eleanor Audley also deserves praise for providing her calmly sinister voice. The stepsisters are suitably annoying, though much time isn't devoted to them. The dress ripping scene is the perfect display of Tremaine's subtle cruelty and has a real emotion heft to it given Cinderella's reaction. Disney regular Verna Felton deserves credit for making the Fairy Godmother a caring and motherly figure for Cinderella.The biggest issue with the film for me is that there are far too many 'cute' moments, most of which involve the mice that help Cinderella. They aren't overly important to the story yet the film gives them ample screen time and all they do is slow down the main plot. They do provide some amusing comic relief at times, but there is simply too much time spent with them when it really should have been spend developing characters like the Prince. Lack of development is something of a general issue with the film, we never really know the true motivations of any of the characters outside of our main character and it does mean you struggle to get engaged in the story at times.On the whole Cinderella is a charming and enjoyable fantasy, yet despite its acclaim and iconic status I certainly don't think it's amongst Disney's best. The animation is spectacular in every sense, Lady Tremaine is a wonderfully evil villain and despite some flaws Cinderella is a pleasant lead. The voice actors all do fantastic jobs and the music is enjoyable as you'd expect from Disney. With that said it certainly suffers from a lack of character development, a flimsy romance and far too much concentration on the animal sidekicks which both harm the story. The memorable moments are worthy, but it just lacks something to be considered as one of Disney best.",5,1,2,5 January 2016
Rear Window," Masterpiece of Suspense, Voyeurism and Film-Making
","The true strength of Rear Window lies with Alfred Hitchcock's understanding of voyeurism. How spying on people and seeing things we shouldn't can be thrilling. For the entirety of the film we're looking through the eyes of our main character Jeff, looking at things he knows he shouldn't be. We become connected to Jeff and when he can't stop himself from seeing and believing things he shouldn't, nor can we. This is the genius of Hitchcock. His main character becomes a vessel. We live the film through him. We share all of the opinions, concerns and limitations he has as a result.Jeff is a notable photographer laid up after breaking his leg and in a cast up to his hip. It's established that he's man of action, a veteran of war and used to globetrotting wherever the job takes him. Hitchcock notes all of this smartly with subtle visuals and dialogue. It's no surprise that being stuck in his apartment leaves Jeff bored, so to pass the time by he begins to spy on his neighbours. His nurse Stella, detective friend Doyle and fiancé Lisa are initially concerned by his behaviour. This conduct is tied to Jeff. He's unable to commit to Lisa and it reinforces her view that'd he rather live through others than himself. The relationship creates an interesting dynamic, as if he gets more gratification spying than from Lisa. Both James Stewart and Grace Kelly are perfect here. Stewart always convinces as the normal guy in over his head and Kelly's elegance adds layers of charm to Lisa.Jeff's prying has unexpected consequences. He becomes convinced that a salesman named Thorwald, who lives in the apartment opposite, has murdered his wife. He sees newly dug spots in the flower bed, a suitcase bound by ropes and the wife completely absent. The film excellently follows a thread where we don't feel cheated because, even though he can jump to conclusions, we see Jeff work everything out. We see him piece together the information and consider its importance. Initially nobody believes him, but little by little and as more becomes apparent it turns out he might just be right. This is all visual story-telling done to perfection. We don't even need words to understand what is taking place. What we see through the lens and piece together is enough. It's intriguing how the seduction of crime is used. Not in taking part in one, but in discovering it. Jeff is snapped out of his boredom when he thinks he's caught someone up to no good. It gives him something to concentrate his efforts on. When Doyle initially tells him that the he has evidence that Thorwald is innocent Jeff is greatly disappointed and so are we. Not because we want someone to be dead, but because we lose the wonder of figuring out what happened. The film plays with moral and psychological issues like that brilliantly. Jeff isn't a detective or a do-gooder, he' simply a normal person. It makes the character more relatable. He sometimes lets situations occur he shouldn't because there's nothing he can do to stop them, he's just an observer. When he wants police action there is nothing he can do. When he can't prove anything he feels frustrated. We can ask ourselves what we'd do in those situations. Probably something similar.For me this is the film that secured Hitchcock's position as the master of suspense and as a master filmmaker. Initially the film seems relatively smooth, yet once Jeff believes he's found a murderer the feeling of unease just keeps on building and building. I no problems in saying that the films climax is one of the most nerve-wracking I've ever witnessed in a film. As Jeff is wheelchair bound we know there is little he can do if spotted and that adds an extra layer of vulnerability. When Lisa risks her neck to investigate there is no way to alert her of danger. We share that same sense of helplessness. Apparently Hitchcock shot all of the film from inside Jeff's apartment, providing a real authenticity to what we see play out. In fact, I think the set itself deserves a mention for just how well-crafted and intricate it is. The heights of suspense, tension and threat reached in Rear Window are so great that very few films have ever been able to come close to following it. For a film that has little connection to policing, serial killers or the unknown that is some achievement. It's also why the film is held in such high regard to this day. It connects the audience directly to the main character. Everything he does we have to follow, almost as if we ourselves are sharing the secrets that he discovers. It also explains why the film's suspense works so well, we are equally as scared of being found out. Tapping into all kinds of thoughts and fears whilst remaining effortlessly gripping. It showed perfectly that Hitchcock was a master of his craft.",10,0,1,11 July 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Ludicrous in Every Sense
","Matthew Vaughn has proved himself to be a talented and versatile director, touching upon the crime, fantasy and superhero genres with mostly positive results. With Kingsman his focus turned to creating the most extravagant spy spoof imaginable. In its simplest terms, Kingsman is to the James Bond film series what Kick-Ass is to the average superhero film. Every aspect is pushed to its limits in an attempt to create a wild mix of shock and awe. It's brash, crude, ultra- violent, highly stylised and full of exaggerated characters. Where Kick-Ass worked because of its wit and overblown set-pieces, I feel that Kingsman is just too straight-forward and juvenile in its humour to truly succeed despite some impressive features.The plot is pretty basic as we see down on his luck chav Eggsy join a secret spy service named Kingsman which his father had once belonged to, undertaking training and attempting to stop an internet mastermind from taking over the world. The issues with the plot are mainly to do with its simplicity in that we've seen this type of story so many times. Once you know the beats everything else goes out the window, we know Eggsy will use his skills to be a part of Kingsman and that makes the entire training section (which is a good third) obsolete. You certainly have to admire the film for just how big the plot is and how excessive it is willing to go in attempts to spoof Bond, but a lot of it is tired and predictable.In terms of its comedy and spoof attempts the film is very mixed. The more straight British humour is always welcomed and Jackson provides plenty of amusement with his over-the-top villain. Plus anything references the Bond series usually stands out too. With that said, there are a lot of puns that just don't work and some of the jokes end up feeling completely out of place. Crude humour can be very effective if used correctly, but I think that the crude jokes are mistimed here and that the film does suffer from becoming too reliant on them at many points. The final joke really does end things on a bum note (pun intended there).It's hard to fault the cast however. Taron Egerton does a fine job in his big screen debut, handling the comedy with finesse and convincing as a spy in training. Eggsy could easily have been an annoying or unlikeable character so he did well to provide him with such charisma. Colin Firth is excellent as Eggsy's mentor figure Galahad, possessing a smooth charm absent in many of his roles and being surprisingly convincing in the action scenes. Samuel L. Jackson is in top form here with a brilliantly extravagant performance. With a goofy lisp, it's a fun call to the classic early Bond villains with Jackson being engaging and frequently hilarious whenever he's on screen. Mark Strong is good fun as the Scottish technological savvy Merlin. Michael Caine shows up as Kingsman head Arthur though he gets little to do and Sophie Cookson is just okay as Eggsy's sweet teammate.The film is appropriately stylised and slick looking, reminiscent of Vaughn's X-Men film. It fits the film given its homages to the classic Bond films and other grand spy flicks, though I think the villain's lair could have been more creative. Sadly the score by Henry Jackman and Matthew Margeson is very forgettable, as instead of doing a take on the scores of the Bond or Bourne films it just turns into a generic action soundtrack with little to remember. Despite the films spoof nature there aren't as many references as there could have been and I think the film would have been more fun had it made these clearer. The action sequences are arguably the highlights of the film. They are filmed excellently and with a real sense of flair, with the church scene in particular being delightfully chaotic.Kingsman is undeniably fun at times and does have some understanding of how to poke fun at its subject matter. The problems I have with it are mostly down to its simplistic plot line and over-reliance on crude humour. It's a story we've seen too many times and it really missed a trick not taking apart the typical spy formula more. Whilst the jokes can work, I feel that there is a lack of wit to much of the comedy and it appears to backtrack to crudeness whenever it's unsure of what to do next. With that said I do find the acting enjoyable with Jackson really standing out, the action is outstanding and the film does have an unquestionable style. I think the potential for a great film was here, but we'll have to make do with enjoying the fun pieces placed throughout.",5,1,6,10 May 2016
Tarzan," Strangers like me
","Tarzan is considered to be the final film of the 'Disney Renaissance'. It's hard to argue with that, as it was the studios last big box office hit and widely acclaimed film for a number of years. It is also a story that is perfectly tailored to Disney's style given its strong underlying themes and emotive characters. Importantly it understands the key aspects within the story as it provides a lot of feeling and intrigue to what is a straight-forward story. Tarzan's parents are killed in the jungle, he is raised by apes and he later battles the feelings that he doesn't belong with them. It is rather bare when you look at it like that, but Disney knows that what is important is seeing these characters grow and change through the challenges put in their way. Tarzan (Tony Goldwyn) himself is near perfect. He's kind, he's curious, he's smart, but he is also very much human and makes mistakes in realising that. He is someone that we can get behind and care about. Seeing him grow throughout the film and become more ape- like whilst becoming less human is really engaging. You do feel for him and connect with his struggle of getting his adoptive father to accept him as his own. I wasn't a fan of the stuff with the young Tarzan, but once he gets older the story keeps on becoming more interesting as we see Tarzan questioning who he is.The other characters are good too. Jane is just fantastic. She takes such joy from the little details, has plenty of funny moments and Minnie Driver does a superb job. Plus I found the romance between her and Tarzan very believable, more than I can say for many Disney efforts. Kala (Glenn Close) is nicely sympathetic and her bond with Tarzan is well developed, while Karchak has legitimate reasons for his hostility and Lance Henriksen is excellent as always. Clayton is a slightly weak villain and another who is just after money (which is a bit of a cop-out), but Brian Blessed's booming voice gives the character something of an edge. The professor (Nigel Hawthorne) gets some funny lines too. The animation is just spectacular. To see Tarzan effectively surf across the trees and vines is wonderful to see. What impresses me is how well the animation flows because at times it moves so quickly, especially in those surfing scenes. The jungle setting lends itself to some creative visuals too. There's some fabulous action sequences too that are always full of energy and really suspenseful, especially with the climax. The story is told relatively serious which is a suitable for a story like this. The comic relief can feel out of place but it is mostly kept to a minimum and most of the humour simply comes from the situations.The music is simply brilliant. I'm not a big fan of Phil Collins, but the songs here are really good songs and the lyrics perfectly convey the emotions that Tarzan is going through like they should. 'Two Worlds' and 'Strangers Like Me' are especially good. They might get in the way for some, but for me they were really impressive and never felt out of place. Of course the film isn't without flaws. Though Tarzan's dilemma is addressed, I would have liked to see the film look deeper into his problems. I also found characters like Terk (Rosie O'Donnell) rather annoying and not really needed. Plus I wish the cheetah that killed Tarzan's parents was given more of a story, he could have been a great obstacle for Tarzan to overcome given the personal history.Tarzan is a very impressive piece from Disney and it knows exactly where to keep its focus. It crafts a character that the audience cares about and puts him through a journey that we want to see the outcome of. I enjoyed how serious the story was kept and how the relationships between the characters felt real. It isn't perfect and stumbles at times, but its heart is always in the right place and when it works it is frequently brilliant. I like the characters, the animation is just great and the music is really effective. Tarzan is a worthy take on a well-known story, frequently striking a chord and doing what Disney do best.",7,9,10,9 October 2015
Apollo 13," Aim for the Stars
","There is something innately fascinating about films that are based upon real historical events. To know that what we're on screen actually happened in some capacity, or at least most of it did, makes what you're seeing so much more potent than fiction. When you think about it the aborted Apollo 13 lunar mission is prefect for the big screen. Three astronauts on a mission to get home against all odds with the intelligence of those back on Earth as their only hope. It almost writes itself. The story of Apollo 13 mainly succeeds as a film because it is told with a great deal of clarity and a clear understanding of its aims. From a technical viewpoint to a directing and an acting one, the film is pretty much faultless which only adds to its entertainment value. Ron Howard is frequently accused of being far too sentimental in his directing, which I do at times agree with, yet he is pretty much perfect for this film. He views this time period as one of wonder and discovery. I think that his more emotional style suits the film down to the ground. Every shot of the black of space inspires awe and every conversation between the astronauts and their families comes across as genuine. There are a number of scenes between Lovell and his wife (brilliantly acted by Hanks and Quinlan) that completely avoid falling into the schmaltzy category in part because of how real they are. I'm not sure that many other directors would have been able to get across such emotions as successfully as Howard does here. Hanks, Paxton, Bacon, Sinise and Harris are all superb actors and provide the material with extra weight. Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon all fit perfectly as the astronauts given their charismatic styles. Gary Sinise is always a gripping screen presence and you really get to sense the disappointment he feels at missing out on the voyage. Ed Harris (in an Oscar-nominated performance) is at his most convincing as tough guys, but here he manages to balance that out with deep compassion for his men in what is a powerful performance. Quinlan (who was also Oscar-nominated) probably has the most difficult part as Lovell's wife, but she injects the role with plenty of heart and every expression is believable. The NASA control room is packed full of people, frantically working on various methods to get the astronauts home. Despite some many being involved, almost all of them are fleshed out just enough that we get an idea of their personalities. The ever increasing wave of tension that takes place each time something appears to go wrong is executed magnificently. By the time the craft is attempting re-entry you are truly exhausted, in the best way possible, by all that has taken place. It's a testament to the high quality of the directing and acting that we are so concerned for those that are a piece in something so spectacularly eventful. I like how despite the humanised approach, the film doesn't forget that there needs to be thrills for the story to really hit home and there is tension in all the right places. These instances were aided by stunning visual effects, which still convince to this day, and a beautifully stirring score from James Horner.By the time the film draws to its conclusion you are left emotionally drained. It thrills you in all the ways you'd want it to, and pulls on the heartstrings in the exact same way. For me it doesn't matter that the film can delve into the sentimental a little too often because it fits the style it is going for almost perfectly. It made me care about these individuals, even when we know so little about them. The cast is full of actors who are a joy to watch and they help bring this film to life as much as Howard's deft direction does. Even if you know the outcome of the story you still get drawn into the struggle and constantly questioning whether or not those on board will survive. That is possibly the highest praise that a film of this kind can receive.",8,1,3,15 May 2016
Aladdin," Las Agrabah
","With Beauty and the Beast receiving a best picture Oscar nomination, Disney's appeal was at a high and they were eager to build on their acclaim. Aladdin was the perfect film for this and took a very different approach for the studio, but they didn't forget what had made the previous few films so successful. It took an old-fashioned, solidly set-up story and gave it a much more modern feel with broader humour. You'd think that this would clash, yet it works brilliantly and gives the film a unique edge. It's a fine balancing act and I'm not sure many other Disney films could have carried it off, but this is one where nearly everything tried works no matter how madcap it may be. The film focuses on street urchin Aladdin and the princess Jasmine, both being fed-up with their lives and wishing for something else. After a chance meeting with the princess, Aladdin is roped into finding a lamp for sorcerer Jafar only to keep it and unleash a Genie that gives him three wishes which he uses to try to win over Jasmine. At its core it's a story about two people wanting different things and connecting because of that, just with a lot of comedy and many obstacles put in their way. It's nothing complicated, yet it's a storyline that people can easily get behind and they want to see the arc that both people go through. The romance takes up most of it, but enough time is given to develop Jafar and even the Genie's own dilemma.Aladdin and Jasmine aren't the most interesting characters, but they are very likable and as a result always keep your interest. Aladdin is street smart and Jasmine is adventurous, but both are very warm and easy to like individuals. The Genie is what most people remember and he kind of is the star here. Most of that is down to Robin Williams, whose witty improvisations and mile-a-minute comedic stylings are just brilliant here. Genie is just such a fun character as a result, with a numerous jokes of all kinds and he makes pop culture references that are genuinely funny. The Sultan is enjoyably absent-minded, while the characters that don't talk like Aladdin's monkey Abu and the Magic Carpet do provide some funny moments.Another positive is the villain and Jafar is just fantastic. His menacing design looks great, he manages the difficult task of being sinister whilst also having subtle comedic moments and Jonathan Freeman's eloquently dark voice works to perfection. Not only that but his motivations make sense and his grudge towards Aladdin is set-up excellently. Gilbert Gottfried as his Parrott Iago also offers some good laughs. The animation is truly outstanding. I picture a lot of beautiful reds and golds when I think of this film, it is always very visually appealing and the landscape designs just look lovely. The animation on the Genie is very impressive just by how fast it is and a lot of the movements here flow well despite the rapid speed most of it goes at. It also lends itself to some very effective tense moments, I think the climax in general is superb.The music is very good. All the songs here have very catchy melodies and are memorable, from the serene 'A Whole New World' to the energetic 'Friend Like Me'. None of them get in the way of story and the work well with the animation. The romance impressed me as well because there was a believable bond between Aladdin and Jasmine, they do have chemistry and you do get drawn into their struggle. There are some clichés hanging over some areas, but I don't think they affect things too much. As said the comedy is very modern and filled with pop culture references. Some people might fine this distracting, but like I said I think it gives a different twist on the formula.On the whole I'm a big fan of Aladdin. The ways and means by which they tell this story are very out of the box, but I think that is a big part of its appeal. This is a fresh take on a story that could have been quite dull and as a result is does place it aside as something very different for the studio. As said I really liked the main characters, I thought Jafar was an excellent villain and Robin Williams is simply a whirlwind of comedy. The animation is as impressive as ever and I don't think there is a song here that isn't at least good. I'd have to say that this is easily one of Disney's most entertaining pieces.",8,1,1,15 October 2015
Gangs of New York," How Daniel Day-Lewis can push a film to Greatness
","Gangs of New York has arguably the most mixed legacy of any film directed by Martin Scorsese. The premise is an intriguing one, a battle over the 5 points in NY between those of the mainland and Irish immigrants set in the 1860's. Whilst many people love its scope and authenticity, many have a strong distaste for its weak characterisations and messy dialogue. I'd say I'm in the former category though I can certainly see the films varied faults. As well as those things, what really makes the film work is assured directing by Scorsese and simply an incredible performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.The story smartly weaves together a large scale battle, a revenge tale and real-life historical events (including the NY City Draft Riots). Scorsese is great at telling these kind of hard edged stories and considering how much is being told it really is excellently crafted, nothing feels forced and it all fits together rather seamlessly. The real focus is where it should be on the personal tale of revenge as Amsterdam Vallon gains the trust of crime boss William ''The Butcher'' Cutting, who he intends to kill for murdering his father. It is relatively simple but given the other ideas that the film is trying to bring in and its massive scope, this 'small' main story makes a nice anchor for the film as a whole. It does have slow parts and it does meander at times for little reason, but never to the point where the main focus is lost. I actually really enjoyed how the historical aspects were used in the film and they never felt forced or contrived just to suit the plot. Everything that happened felt like it made perfect sense. There is a genuine tension to the film that makes everything taking place seem more important and there was a real sense of conflict between the two warring factions. Scorsese directs with his usual finesse. He knows how to give you the action up close and make the dialogue appear interesting which is useful give some of the stodgy lines dotted around. The production values are very high and the sets all look extremely authentic, with clear care taken to create such detail. Howard Shore's score was also nicely melodic and held many memorable compositions.The action is as brutal as you would expect it to be. It is very gritty and dirty, while Scorsese shoots it all expertly by placing us within the battle sequences instead of watching it from afar. The opening battle in the snow is especially vivid and beautiful to look at. I will say though that the climax is somewhat messy. Considering the films intensity and the constant tension between the two main characters, the pay-off is a little underwhelming as they just have a small fight then that's it.On to the best feature, Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher. This performance is superb from beginning to end and it's almost impossible to take your eyes off him when he is on screen, this is one of the most interesting characters in modern cinema. Day-Lewis does it all he makes Bill menacing, humorous, aggressive, at times downright terrifying and all with a distinct accent. Yet at the same time many of his ramblings actual have a point and you kind of begrudgingly respect him for never backing down. It is a role that dominates the screen wonderfully and Day-Lewis was certainly robbed of an Oscar for it. Leonardo Dicaprio (in his first of many team ups with Scorsese) is just okay as Amsterdam. He is believable and captures the conflicted nature, but the character simply isn't fleshed out all that well and to be fair that is because he isn't written especially well. His accent wanders too much as well, he can't decide whether he's a New Yorker or if he's Irish. Cameron Diaz isn't as bad as you'd expect, but she doesn't leave much of an impression and her role is sort of bland as a result. Of the rest of the cast Brendan Gleeson and John C. Reilly show up irregularly but with little to do, however Jim Broadbent makes for a fun Boss Tweed.Despite its issues I do have a soft spot for Gangs of New York. Most of that comes from the way this story is told and how Scorsese handles it, keeping the focus on its main plot while allowing us to see the bigger picture and the impressive authenticity in creating the atmosphere of the time. That said Day-Lewis is the real star here with a performance that really drives the film forward and manages to go in every direction without becoming unfocused, with Bill the Butcher rightly becoming a famed modern cinematic character as a result of that. It certainly isn't among Scorsese's best work and there are a variety of minor flaws that do threaten to drag the film down, but I think the things it is good at are things that is extremely good at and its a film that remains gripping despite its sheer size.",7,0,2,3 March 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Loud and Weird for the sake of being Loud and Weird
","Seriously, what happened? Mad Max and The Road Warrior were gritty, uncompromising, atmospheric and above all character driven. They deserve their status as classic post-apocalyptic films. Fast-forward 30 odd years where we have Mad Max: Fury Road, minus Mel Gibson but George Miller still in the directors chair, and it is impossible to recognise that this is meant to be linked to the earlier films. Its a film that is about as subtle as a jackhammer to the head.This is the story: Max and a load of women drive for days in one direction to escape a dictator who pursues them, then they turn around to drive back to where they came from. That is literally it. To say the film is thin on story would be a gross understatement. Not just that but the whole plot is a device in and of itself. They're making the journey to escape Immortal Joe and to reach Paradise, except it turns out that there is no such thing as Paradise anymore. They are in a post-apocalyptic world for heavens sake, I think its obvious that anywhere even remotely pleasant would have been long gone. To add to the insult Max is absolutely redundant in this film, for one I'm amazed he agreed to such an absurd idea to begin with (he's mad not stupid) and two its not his film. You could take him out, replace him with another girl and it would make virtually no difference to anything that happens. The characters are just weak as we learn nothing about any of them beyond a very simple motivation which is all we get, why should we care about any of these one-dimensional cardboard cutouts? The action can be summed up in one word, Overkill. There is a reason that not many people try to make films that are literally 2 hours of action scenes, because it will eventually get tedious and boring, which is exactly what happens here. On about the third time the truck is attacked I completely lost interest because I knew none of the major players were going to be killed. For action to work you need to feel like the characters really are at threat and will lose something, which I never felt and as a result it simply didn't work. By the halfway mark I was seriously weary, because the action sequences just kept banging on. There are hardly any slow or character building moments, with those that appear literally lasting a minute before quickly moving on to more explosions and cars being flipped over. Most of the sequences being practical effects is impressive, but its nowhere near enough to use it to praise the film to death like so many have. As stated, you'd be totally wrong if you thought we were going to get strong and interesting characters to make up for the other areas. Everyone said Charlize Theron gave a great performance, but I saw no evidence of that because she resembled an oak tree more often then not. All she did was brood or look angry, wow that's difficult to do. She handled the more emotional moments, if you would even go as far as to call them that, horribly and with an expression of total boredom. Tom Hardy (who is usually solid as a rock) is a horrid choice as Max. His expression never changes from confused neanderthal and he delivers the dialogue as if he'd just been kicked in the head by a mule. Not to mention he suffers badly from 'Russell Crowe in Robin Hood Syndrome' as his accent constantly swings from Good Day Bruce Aussie to vaguely Cockney to just incoherent mumbling. Everyone else is barely worth the mention. The girls who travel with them? Not one stood out or had any character beyond angry. Immortal Joe? Dull as dishwater. Even Nicholas Hoult is wasted as an extremely annoying rebel.Visually the film is very creative and looks unique which is probably its best feature, the world created is colourful and grimy exactly when it needs to be. That said I don't think the directing is anything out of the box, its simply not as frenzied as other recent action films (looking at you Michael Bay) and some of the CGI is ropey when it pops up. The are also a few surprisingly funny moments (notably the fella with the flare) which are a welcomed release from most of the straight-faced nonsense taking place. I do think the film is too weird basically just to be weird. I mean Immortal Joe's gang have a guitarist whose guitar shoots fire, sure it looks cool but it makes no sense. Yes its a strange world, but does it have to be an impractical one too? I'm really not sure why Fury Road is getting so much acclaim. Is it because it used practical effects in a time dominated by CGI? I actually think it is. Simply because it has nothing else going for it. The story? My last trip to the toilet had more of a plot. The characters? Calling them planks of wood would be an insult to planks of wood. The action? It's crash, bang, wallop for 2 hours non-stop. The whole thing of 'visual story-telling' is simply an excuse by brainless people to basically admit that when you think about it there is no story. Here's a tip to the creators. The two key things in a film are story and character, when your film severely lacks both then you're already in trouble.",3,12,23,1 March 2016
Gladiator," A Decent Action Epic Over-Hyped as Something its Not
","Gladiator should be the type of film that I enjoy. Ridley Scott taking on something much grander than anything he had previously. A cast of fine actors led by Russell Crowe. A return to the sword-and- sandal epics of years gone by. It's a film of fine visual finesse, engaging action sequences and large themes. So why is it that Gladiator left me feeling so cold? Well it falls flat in its two most important areas, story and characters.It follows the gruff general Maximus who is named protector of Rome by Marcus Aurelius, that is until Aurelius is murdered by his own son Commodus who has Maximus exiled and his family killed. From here you can see exactly where the film is going. Maximus finds himself as a slave and is sold to a gladiator trainer named Proximo (played by the always great Oliver Reed) who wants to take him to Rome and help him fight his way to the top. This story is about as basic and clichéd as humanly possible. The hero is betrayed and fights his way back in order to get his revenge. That is effectively the main premise of the film. For such simplicity to work the film has to either add twists to the story or be incredible detailed, yet it does neither.The story also contains a weirdly handled sub-plot about Commodus trying to crush the senate who are constantly attempting to make him tackle real issues instead of hosting games. This could have been a decent side story but it's never fleshed out enough to leave an impact. Involved in basically every story thread is Commodus' sister Lucilla, who he also happens to want a child with (yes, he's that kind of kooky), and she becomes a plot device to link all of these pieces together. Joaquin Phoenix hams it up big time as Commodus and to be fair he is clearly meant to be a pantomime villain and Phoenix is probably the only person having fun in the entire film. Connie Nielsen deserves credit too for holding her own despite her incredibly underwritten character.Of course when Maximus and his gladiators get to Rome, they smash through all that stand in their way leading to the crowd turning over to Maximus' side and an inevitable confrontation with Commodus. How Russell Crowe won an Oscar for his performance is a mystery. Crowe himself is fine, but the role is as basic tough guy as it comes and anyone with a bit of muscle could have played the role as it is. Maximus is simply a poor leading character. He's just dour and dull as a rock for the entirety of the film, even before his family are killed off. What's is also notable is that the character doesn't grow. He's a bland, unsympathetic slab from the get-go who just becomes slight more revenge-fuelled as things progress. How can we empathise with this type of main character?Clearing those obstacles, I have little problems with the film on a technical level. It's Ridley Scott so you know the film with be very detailed and beautiful on a visual level and that is exactly what we get. Rome looks magnificent. Vast, majestic and full of people, whilst even the CGI is impressive and manages to blend in seamlessly. The film has an almost dirty brown, hazy look to it that actually works to its advantage. It fits the sullen mood that many of the gladiator's find themselves in. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard provide a score that feels like it's been ripped off by every action movie since it, especially the pieces where Gerrard appears to be singing in a made up language.The action scenes are a highlight. There is a grittiness to them that works for this time period. They not that well-choreographed and I thing that ways purposefully done, in order the show how many of the gladiators were fighting by using sheer aggression and desperation. Every stabbing or wounding looks and sounds painful and not in an overblown or unnatural way. The Coliseum looks fabulous and the films gets across the intimidating atmosphere of having to fight in there. I do have problems with how easily Maximus rises to the top, seeing as he's able to lead the gladiators through tough battles and defeat the only undefeated gladiators with relative ease. Then the climax eventually boils down to Maximus v Commodus and its entirely predictable and just a boring way to end.What is notable is that Gladiator didn't affect me on an emotional level at all. Even comparable epics like 'Braveheart', which shares similar issues, moved me. Gladiator left me numb. I didn't care about Maximus' plight because I was just given a shell of a character to try and get behind. I wasn't engaged in the story because it was simply a downbeat repeat of a storyline that has been done to death. I didn't even care on a basic level to see the villain get his comeuppance. All the talks of political treachery, what it means to be a gladiator and of meeting again in the afterlife just seemed like pieces to fill the film out. I can't deny that the film is a technical marvel or say that it bored me, but I can state that is built upon a story and set of characters that are wholly uninteresting.",5,1,3,30 June 2016
Pocahontas," The declining renaissance?
","So after a run of successful films and a monster hit with The Lion King, it was up to Disney to keep the goods coming. Sadly Pocahontas didn't turn out as the crowd pleaser the studio hoped it would and it ended their hot streak by being something of a critical disappointment. It's not difficult to see why however. This was a very different take in a number of ways and dealt with actual historical events for the first time, so people were ready to scrutinise the film if need be. Credit must be given to the team behind it for taking such a risk at their peak and though it has its good points it definitely isn't up to the standard of its predecessors.I think most people are familiar with the story. A group of British settlers, amongst them is John Smith, come to new found land with dreams of finding gold and eliminating savages. Smith meets and bonds with one of the natives named Pocahontas, as they begin to see that both sides can get along and avoid bloodshed. Here is the issue I have with this story, it has been done to death. It's the typical white men invade the land, one realises his mistake and they all see that the inhabitants aren't savages. We've seen it numerous times before to the point where you know exactly what will happen, making it totally uninteresting. They needed to do something truly different or experimental for this story to be engaging, which they sadly don't.This could be salvaged if the characters are interesting, but they're not. Pocahontas (Irene Bedard) is as bland as they come. They try to make her adventurous and free-spirited, but she has no personality and just comes across as a bit of a moaner. John Smith (a monotone Mel Gibson) is equally as bland. I know he's meant to be a normal guy, it's just that he's a complete bore and does almost nothing of note throughout. If your main characters are like this then it's not a good sign. The natives are simply okay and a lot of Grandmother Willow's (Linda Hunt) dialogue seems very out of place. Thomas (a young Christian Bale) is likable enough and Ben is quite funny thanks to Billy Connolly, but there's a dearth of appealing characters.The villain is very weak too. Ratcliffe (Disney regular David Ogden Stiers) is another guy who is completely fuelled by greed and just wants gold. He has absolutely no character beyond that, he isn't funny or threatening and he's only there to provide a bit of conflict. Another issue I had was with the animal sidekicks. There were far too many 'cute' moments, where there's a bit of slapstick or they do something silly and it clashes badly with the relatively serious tone. Plus given the themes of nature I think the animals should talk and it would make sense, it's strange that a tree talks but the animals don't. The songs are pretty bland for the most part, not remotely memorable and there are a few too many that get in the way. Though I will say 'Colours of the Wind' is excellent.You might think I hate this film, but I don't and there are some very good areas. For one the animation is simply incredible. It is easily some of Disney's best ever. I'm not sure what it is about the colours but they are so vibrant that they almost leap off the screen and the backgrounds are just beautiful to look at. Simple things such as the rivers and the trees are animated gorgeously, while there's lots of sky blues and pinks that create a lovely colour palette. It's clear that a lot of work was put into the visuals and it certainly pays off. The characters are drawn more to look like real people which is also nice. Alan Menken's score is very effective and sets a good mood when it appears. There's also a strong atmosphere at certain points, especially in the quieter scenes, that I wish ran through the whole film.Even though I don't think Pocahontas is a particularly good film, I can see why others do and it does have things to admire. I respect Disney for trying something very different to their usual work and I think the animation is a massive strong point. However it suffers in its two key areas, with a story that was already stale when it came out and with characters that it is almost impossible to get invested in. Not to that mention some of the decisions to take with the story are questionable and it is all over the place in regards to its take on history. It is very much a mixed bag, especially given Disney's successes at the time, but it's certainly an interesting addition.",5,2,4,11 October 2015
The Birds," Hitchcock's Last Great Film
","Hitchcock never limited himself. He stuck mostly to the thriller genre but his films always blended varying styles and themes. The Birds is his venture into pure horror, an area that he'd touched on previously but never fully dived into. It's him taking the atmosphere that runs through many of his mysteries and combing it with imagery and ideas that succeed in being as macabre as possible. The whole idea behind the film is preposterous, yet it is clear that the whole point is using it to create as frightening a spectacle as possible and that is something the master of suspense achieves. The set-up involves wealthy Californian socialite Melanie Daniels journeying to Bodega Bay in order to woo lawyer and bachelor Mitch Brenner, after he makes a thinly veiled invite to her. She meets his icy mother and cheerful little sister, the local school teacher and the townspeople all seem nice enough so she decides to stay for the weekend. Of course this is part of the film's genius, everything moves along smoothly and seems pleasant for most of the first half, creating a sense of ease on the surface that you know is just waiting to be torn apart. Tippi Hedren puts in a very good performance, far greater than she would later do in 'Marnie' where she appeared to be suffocated by the complexities of the material. She is clearly at her best when she can play to her naturally warm and charming personality, which are traits she aptly passes on to Melanie.Something more sinister starts to form when large groups of birds begin attacking and killing the locals at random with no reasoning, leaving the entire town stranded, confused and defenceless against further attacks. It's a true testament to Hitchcock's genius that he was able to make a species as seemingly harmless as birds appear to be the most vicious and terrifying out there. He does what he is so good at, building unease and dread slowly out of seemingly ordinary situations. It would be nowhere near as scary if it wasn't for the deliberately paced build-up. The film is surprisingly brutal and visceral even for modern day. There's no shortage of people cut or sliced as a result of the attacks. The scene where the farmer's body is discovered is truly horrifying. Even the bleak ending, something Hitchcock was no stranger to, feels much darker than usual. The characters present here are so enjoyable and distinctly drawn that you could lose the entire birds gone wild aspect and it would still be an interesting watch. The suave Mitch (played smoothly by the ideal Hitchcock leading man Rod Taylor), his distant mother Lydia, the sharp school teacher Annie Hayworth, the crotchety old ornithologist, they are all sharply defined and engaging presences. It's something that Hitchcock also did to great effect in his previous film 'Psycho', he gave us characters that we gain some kind of connection to so that when the terror begins we feel invested in what's at stake. There's plenty of smartly handled scenes that establish details about their personalities and moods, such as a nicely emotive one that explains Lydia's coldness. Hitchcock has paced the film perfectly, there isn't a second that is boring or uninteresting to watch. The effects are understandably dated, but still rather impressive for how much creativity was used in making it look like a massive flock of birds was causing so much destruction. All kinds of techniques were used and most of them blend together effectively. If anything it is simply guilty of showing too much ambition for the time period. What is notable is that the film contains no score, regular collaborator Bernard Herrmann is noted as 'sound consultant', and that is an interesting stylistic choice. The film appreciates the strength of silence and uses it fantastically. How unease can be crafted because everything appears to be too quiet. There is a potency with in that which the film taps in to. It also means that the piercing squawks that emerge once the birds attack are all the more startling.For me personally this is Hitchcock's last truly great film. One where the story, the writing, the acting, the scares and the direction all came together to create something both spectacular and memorable. None of his films that followed ever reached the same heights, whether it was because one of these areas was dealt with poorly or a multitude of them were. Here Hitchcock knew better than anyone that there has to be a story and set of people that we feel invested in for the film to truly work. As a result this film is a masterpiece in how to gradually build tension and craft horror that packs a punch. When the scares come along they work outstandingly, partly because of the gruesome imagery but also because we're invested in the story.",9,1,2,17 July 2016
Beetlejuice," Fun ideas and premise, but lacks plot and hilarity
","Beetlejuice was the second big budget film from visionary Tim Burton and is the first film were you see some of his later trademarks come in. The film is packed with dark comedy, comical horror, offbeat performances and Gothic visuals that have become a mainstay in most of his movies. It has a lot going for it, but the execution holds the film back. The story focuses on young couple Adam and Barbara Maitland who are killed in a car crash, yet they live on as ghosts in their home. Problems arise when a strange family move into the house and any attempts to get rid of them prove to be useless. The only solace the Maitland's get is with the young daughter who happens to be able to see them. The Maitland's are left with no choice but to hire crazy 'Bio- Exorcist' Beetlejuice who guarantees to get rid of the family. The premise is an extremely inventive one, the idea of ghosts expelling humans does sound very funny and starts off well here. The problem lies within how it's told as the film loses focus the longer it goes on. The film lacks coherence as a lot of things come from nowhere and aren't explained well.The cast all do solid jobs. Alec Baldwin is very good in a reserved and very naturalistic performance as Adam, he comes off as a likable everyday person which means the ghost scenario genuinely confuses him. Geena Davis also puts in a very good turn as the laid-back and sweet natured Barbara. She too has a real sense of likability to her and the chemistry between her and Baldwin comes off as sincere. Winona Ryder is good as the goth inspired daughter Lydia. Ryder does have a good screen presence and comes across as innocently charming. Catharine O'Hara is excellent as the eccentric and obsessive Delia, she has a great sense of comic timing that is put to good use. Jeffery Jones is also great as calm Charles. However Michael Keaton steals the show as the equally bizarre, wacky and hilarious title character. His energetic expressions, exuberant delivery and knack for physical comedy work brilliantly here.Visually the film is a typical Burton one with bright designs mixed in with the Gothic styling he usually goes for. The ghost world that is created is really imaginative and the colour scheme used adds to the supernatural theme nicely. The humour is a problem with the film. At times it doesn't go as far with the comedy as it should do which means that most of the comic sequences are wasted while when does go comically over-the-top, the calypso scene, it just feels forced. The scenes in the afterlife offices and the ones involving Beetlejuice were the only ones that had the ability to draw the laughs naturally. The comic horror aspects are used effectively and balance out with the straight up comedy well. The special effects are very weak too. They are extremely dated and the usage of Claymation looks very fake these days. The music from Danny Elfman is quite good and carries that quirky dark sound that works perfectly well with in the film. On the whole Beetlejuice does have a fun premise and a brilliant Keaton performance, yet it lacks a fluid structure and truly funny moments to become anything great.",5,4,9,31 October 2013
The Godfather," One of the greatest films ever made
","The Godfather is easily the shining star in the crime genre and 'epic' films in general. It is seen as one of the greatest films of all time and it's pretty simple to see why. Everything about it is magnificent, the story is one of cinemas finest, the characters are dynamic and well developed, the music is timeless and it captures post-war America/organised crime era like no other. The story follows the Corleone crime family, the aging head Don Vito wishes to move his family into modern times which corresponds with his youngest son Michael returning from the war and his daughter's wedding. The Don is approached to do a deal with drug dealer Sollozzo, but turns him down which leads to his own fatal shooting. This leads to the aggressive Sonny talking control and Michael, who was set to lead a normal life, being dragged into a mob war that changes the family like no-one could have imagined. The story is brilliant, it's never straightforward and will always keep you guessing as what will happen to the characters. It takes you on a journey, starting at one place and ending a million miles away, but making sure that everything flows and makes sense.Every single cast member nails their role, which is some achievement given the massive amount of characters. Marlon Brando gives one of cinemas greatest characters as the aging Don, everything from the way he speaks to the way he moves is perfectly done. Al Pacino got his breakthrough and he commands the screen. The way he manages to show the subtle changes in the seemingly calm Michael are excellent, he becomes more twisted and less humane as the film goes on. After all it is mainly based on the changes he goes through. James Caan is also brilliant as the hot-headed Sonny, his great screen presence works wonders in showing a man who can't control is anger. Robert Duvall deserves equal praise as the reserved and smart Tom Hagen, a nice alternative to the others. Everyone else is great, from Richard Castellano and Abe Vigoda as Vito right hand men to John Cazale as the frail Fredo to Al Lettieri as the menacing Sollozzo to Diane Keaton as the gentle Kay. The look of the film is fantastic, the cinematography is dark and dimly coloured which helps to reflect the era perfectly. The music is equally fabulous. The main theme is one of the most recognisable of all time and the music does carry an authentic Italian feel. The depth in which Coppola goes to study these characters has to applauded too, giving some of the most well developed characters on the big screen. The way they are different and sometimes polar opposites , the way Sonny lacks control and is aggressive whilst Michael is very much in control and distant. This fascinating aspect helps develop events greatly. The violence makes more sense here, it's done to shape the characters views and set off new events instead of just being there for the sake of it. That idea is what also elevates the film, everything is done for a reason and fits in perfectly with the story giving most of the events much more weight and meaning than usual. The film also excellently sets up events, such as Michael warning Fredo not to side against the family and the move to Nevada, that would be explored in part II. There's not one bad thing about the whole film, one of the few films where that can be said. The Godfather remains incredibly gripping and intriguing all the way through thanks to the epic story, acting and directing.",10,1,3,29 October 2013
