Hereditary," Overrated & Overhyped!
","I was really expecting more from this movie, especially with all the hype. I watched till the end but drifted off about 5 times towards the end and had to skip it back but I hadn't missed anything really.The acting is great which makes up for a lot.A few details that bothered me about this movie:The family - they didn't seem like they were a family to me. I thought the older male was the leads father to begin with, not her husband.
The son looked like he was adopted (part of the story tells you he's definitely not adopted), as he looks completely different from his mother and sister which just brought the authenticity feel factor down a few notches.The lack of empathy from the characters, are families really that cold - I felt the family were off with each other from the very start.The general lack of a timeline - the movies timeline doesn't skip or flash forwards; backward; or sidewards, but I felt it was difficult to work out if a scene was taking place 1 day, 1 week or 1 month apart from the previous scene.
An example is when Annie meets Joan in the car park, Joan greets Annie like she hasn't seen her in months, but it feels like she was at Joan's house just a few days ago. I understand Joan's reaction to meeting Annie in the carpark is mostly her excitement for sharing the seance information but the way it's approached makes it feel they haven't talked for a while.
Generally I was disappointed by this movie.I won't watch this again for a long time.",5,1,3,8 January 2019
