Changeling," Kinda silly
","Not a bad movie, but it isn't very well-directed. It assumes the mother is in a vacuum and that the whole 'where is my son?!?' plea is just between her and the fake son. There's no family to back her up? No teachers that would back up her story that the impostor isn't her son, at the very beginning?!?!? No neighbors, no friends, no aunts, uncles, etc., etc., etc.?!I think Clint Eastwood is a great actor but his direction skills aren't very good when it comes to an important topic like police corruption.IMDb is apparently being run by dumb people/kids, and is saying the review above is not long enough. How stupid. So here it goes again:Not a bad movie, but it isn't very well-directed.

The Usual Suspects," ahead of its time for those who don't care about quality
","Nothing about this movie is very special. It is long and drawn out, and not very interesting. I've watched it three times now, hoping to understand why so many people like, but I still have to classify it as the type of movie that would be enjoyed by people who are easily amused.The acting is weak, the story is boring, the direction is below average, and that is all there is to say.But if you are easily amused, then you probably would like this movie and would give it a high rating.IMDb makes you add a certain amount of lines before you can submit a review, so I'll just copy what I said above.Nothing about this movie is very special.
