Hereditary," A Refreshing Horror Film
","I've been expecting this movie on a TV program, not sure if it makes a difference watching it on TV instead of in the cinema.What I like about this movie:<ul><li>Realistic family trauma and dysfunction. Apart from jumpscares, I usually don't get scared by the gist of many horror movies since I practice Eastern spirituality, but this movie made me feel uncomfortable watching the generational family trauma and dysfunction, especially the distant relationships between family members e.g. the mum lying to the dad about going to therapy sessions, the dad lying to the mum about the grandma's corpse and possibly hiding from others the fact that he took pills to help him deal with the family drama, the distant relationship of the son and the mum, the young daughter who was not paid much attention to by anyone. All of these resulted from the family trauma of the past generation initiated by the grandma who secretively was a member of a satanic cult.</li></ul><ul><li>The movie also doesn't use jumpscares which makes it very refreshing as it still leaves the feelings of horrible helplessness and desperation of a human being.</li></ul><ul><li>The gore scenes which are done just about right, not too much that it gets boring or too less that it gets unexciting.</li></ul>Other comments about this movie:<ul><li>The story of Paimon as a whole isn't terrifying to me at all.</li><li>Some cult-ish behaviors are funny e.g. standing naked smiling here and there.</li><li>The death of the dad felt rushed and unuseful.</li><li>The family could have easily called the police many times after a series of strange events and the mum's increasingly worrisome behavior, not just mentioning about doing it. The cult could have been rounded up or something.</li></ul>All in all, this movie impresses me with the constant psychological tension of a malelovent side of a family life rather than the paranormal activity one.",Null,0,2,30 June 2019
