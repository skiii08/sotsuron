The King's Speech," Extraordinary !!!!
","There is nothing on this earth to be more prized than true friendship , and that is the most beautiful message in this movie . This film gives us a different perspective to the Royals , that they like the rest of the world have weaknesses . As you watch it you feel like you are travelling through time , in a magical epoch . Colin Firth played King George VI in a unique way not so usual and his match with Jeffrey Rash was out of this world . The only error is that his older brother the duke of Windsor in the picture looks a lot younger than George VI .",9,0,0,16 April 2018
