United 93," Gripping
","My wife and i saw united93 today and i was not that keen to see it.Whilst watching this i was thinking where is Bruce and Arnie,but this is real and no heroes to save the day.This chilled me to the very core of my being,it was done quite well with respect to the people on the flight and the air traffic controllers.The film makers have done well considering that the whole world knows the outcome.The pacing is exceptional and the hand held camera work add to the realism.I recommend seeing this as it is a grim reminder of the evil that man can do,and the courage that we all have in us when facing certain death.Our session had a total of six people and it was quite eerie at the end which was also done well.",7,0,2,20 August 2006
