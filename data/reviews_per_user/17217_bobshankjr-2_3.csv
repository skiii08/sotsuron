Skyfall," Best Bond, with a decades-plethora of memories
","'I like you bettah without your Beretta'...he says gently into Severin's left ear in the shower, and her reply: 'I feel naked without it...' With that kind of scene dialogue, and almost half-way through the film, you'll eventually begin to realize you're watching not only a subtler and more refined version of earlier Bond films, but a new genre of them: more seductive musical scores, better background scenery and fewer external distractions which stay tighter with the anticipated action - and impeccably filmed and edited scenes. Nevertheless, your memory will recognize the initial intent within any Bond film: to alert, instantly, on the dramatic - and which exercises one's heart to full capacity in one of the finest movie series ever to hit the big screen.",9,1,6,21 November 2013
Catch-22," Sanity trying to make sense of the insanity of war
","Despite it's 42 years since initial release, still one of the best films ever made and directed about the insanity of 'creating' war - and the mindlessness and trauma suffered from its consequences of both those conscripted to engage in it and neither more nor less than the civilian victims of it's long-time aftermaths. Warfare's far-reaching ramifications touch us, individually and globally, even into the 21st Century and beyond. Being philosophically cogent of war's deep-seated egoistic, bizarre and greedy nature of those who foment it may not get you a Pulitzer, but perhaps you may garner a 'Catch 22' medal from those of us who've managed to live through them. Mike Nichols et al, within this film, remind us of war's senselessness and of it's bitter and long-effected remains. Superb, finely crafted, and in my sense, a must-see for 2nd and 3rd generation adults.",10,22,28,17 March 2012
The Big Blue," A wonderful, haunting, compelling film
","One of the most haunting and beautifully constructed films I've ever seen. Unique in theme, unusual in story, masterfully photographed, compelling in content - and with a gorgeous, dreamy musical score by Bill Conti in the 'short'-version USA release (owning, and having seen both releases, I much prefer the 'short' one). In my viewing of both versions, the 'long' one stutters and stammers, becomes much too complicated, and misses the poignancy of emotion directly attached to this film - which is the essence of its beauty. A film unlike any you've seen in content, viewers are compelled to attempt to put together the 'theme' from the outset? The first clues come in black and white at the film's beginning as we realize the slight French boy and the burly Italian kid are heart-friends - yet rivals at a distance. The scene is set, and now we can't wait to experience their reunion (and a hint at the plot!) years later, as they meet each other from vastly different venues within the same dangerous sport of free diving. How many of you even realized there was such an extreme sport as 'Competitive Apnea', http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_diving, when you first viewed this film?and more, that it is world-class?? I'll wager the vast majority of you hadn't a clue. And yet I see the many reviews as if it were 'extreme skate-boarding'(!) Here's a shiny Euro in the harbor, buy yourself a life with it - if you can hold your breath that long. This is a glorious movie. See 'both' versions - then, be honest with yourself. Luc Besson is not to be toyed with ~Bob Shank, Tucson, AZ (and, yes, I dive - in the Sea of Cortez, Baja California - 4 hours away)",Null,0,1,21 December 2010
