The King's Speech," An impeccable British film for audiences across the pond, too.
","The King's Speech is the type of film that wins awards, despite what mass audiences may think of it. It is beautifully made, almost without any blemish at all. The acting is beyond superb; Colin Firth must and will win the Best Actor Oscar in a brilliantly ironic performance where he succeeds at being unable to talk. This performance goes beyond simply getting down the patterns of King George's stammer; it is detailed and calculated for every scene to create a stunning portrayal of a man afraid of his duty to his country but brave enough to attempt it, unlike his brother. Helena Bonham Carter also deserves great recognition for her small but important role as George's wife, a pleasant woman who fiercely loves her husband and is willing to do anything to help him. Yet, perhaps the best and most overlooked performance is that of Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue, a rather unorthodox speech therapist whose unequivocal mannerisms and treatment of George as simply another patient stir up in the nervous monarch the courage and determination to defeat his setbacks.All accolades aside, this is an interesting film to approach. It is being hailed by many as one of the best films of 2010 along with The Social Network. In many ways, they share similar themes and ideas. Both are about the power of communication and language. Each focuses on one individual attempting to change their methods of connecting with others, though for very different reasons. The most interesting difference between the two films is how they are made and the style and substance each possesses. The King's Speech is a glorious British period piece, focusing on the commoner's favorite topic: royalty, methodically paced and wonderfully made with excellent acting, stunning sets, minimalistic direction and a tasteful and witty script. By contrast, The Social Network hurdles at a pace rarely seen by films today that don't include an action sequence. The speech is biting, cunning, cynical and is thrown at the audience so quickly it bears a second viewing just to understand all the great lines.So, the question everyone will ask on February 27 is which film will walk away with the most Oscars? In thinking about that question, having seen and greatly admired both films, perhaps it is best to not care what the Academy thinks and appreciate each film on its own merit. Each has a different story, style and audience in mind and for those goals they pass with flying colors. In a way, this is the kind of film that destroys the rigid thinking of such awards and presentations. I am sure that the actors, writers, director and other cast and crew on each film did not make their respective works in hopes of winning the little golden statue. They did so because they believed in the material and were willing to do their best to ensure it was the best viewing experience possible.With these thoughts in mind, I will watch the Oscars ceremony, not worried about which film will win the coveted Best Picture. Rather, I will attempt to appreciate each work for what it is: a crowning achievement for all involved and a depiction of the power and influence speech and communication can have. Whether you're a WWII-era Brit or a modern-day American with a Facebook account, it's easy to see that these films are great examples of how to make an organic, exciting and moving story.",Null,0,2,30 January 2011
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The sentimental Tarantino.
","After a bloody good time in Vol. 1 watching Uma Thurman slice of body parts left and right, Quentin Tarantino settles down to give us more story and heart as he finishes the tale of the Bride's revenge against all who betrayed her. While the first part was an homage to kung fu and samurai movies, there are more elements of spaghetti westerns here as well as swordplay. Still, the story is so captivating and miraculous that you get swept in and forget about everything else. Here, we have significantly less action, more impeccable dialogue, and we begin to connect with some of the characters, especially the Bride and Bill. It helps to have good actors and Tarantino has an amazing cast. Thurman carried the first film and is just as good here, but David Carradine as Bill really struck me as how passive yet brutal he could be. It really is a fine piece of acting. Here, we see the sentimental Tarantino, one not really popular with some but I love it. Here, Tarantino gives us situations and events that trigger different emotions and we feel for all these characters. This in my mind makes Vol. 2 a better film than Vol. 1, but really it is all one movie. So, be sure to watch this incredible story of betrayal, vengeance, love, hatred, and of course that impeccable dialogue. You'll be glad you did.",10,0,1,13 May 2008
Vertigo," The Master's Masterpiece.
","It can be argued in many different ways what actually is the best film Alfred Hitchcock ever made. For my money, it is Vertigo, the masterful story of a man who finds a woman, loses her, and attempts to bring her back with harrowing results.What makes this film so engaging, even after multiple viewings, is the way in which Hitchcock is able to bring us to sympathy with the protagonist, Scottie Ferguson, an ex-detective with some serious psychological issues. As Scottie begins to follow the wife of one of his college friends, he becomes fascinated by the icy, alluring blonde. We feel the same way. When something terrible happens to her, we feel the anguish and guilt Scottie does. Of course, none of this could be possible without the incredible performance of James Stewart, perhaps his best after the role of George Bailey. And Hitchcock makes the most of this evocative first half, told mostly in long shots and soft lighting.The second half is more of an attempt for Scottie to rebound and when he finds a girl similar to the mysterious blonde, he finds himself trying to recreate that which is gone. Of all of Hitchcock's films, this may be the strangest with themes of necrophilia, voyeurism, and sexual obsession. Matching Stewart's incredible performance every step of the way is Kim Novak, in my mind the best of Hitchcock's blonde actresses, so beautiful yet almost forbidding in a way. Maintaining every scene with careful scrutiny and eye for detail, this may be Hitchcock's best showing as a director, and it all leads up to one of the best filmed endings in cinema history and leaves you needing to watch again, hoping to catch a glimpse of the true emotions of Scottie and Judy, or is it Madeline?",10,3,6,29 May 2009
Black Swan," Commands your every bit of attention.
","Black Swan is the type of film most moviegoers won't want to see until they hear from a select few how good it really is. On the surface, it appears to be a simple overwrought, art-house wannabe that strains to be important and ends up being self-aware and arrogant. Oh, how people can be wrong.Everything you may think this film is, it very well may not be. From the opening sequence, a beautifully crafted, unbroken shot of a young woman and man dancing the White Swan from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, Darren Aronofsky's bold and insatiable tale never lets the audience's attention go. This is not simply a story about the pressures of professional ballerinas and their tendency to get caught up in their work. This is a thrilling, engaging psychological drama that plays with POV and omniscient narrator. We don't know what is happening because Nina Sayers doesn't.So much can be said about this film, what it represents and how those themes are addressed. Yet, perhaps the best way to review this film is to simply try to encourage potential viewers to leave their logic and reason at home and try to get wrapped up in this story through its bold acting and wildly arresting visuals. Natalie Portman is the odds-on favorite to win the Best Actress Oscar next month and though I haven't seen the other potential nominee's work, I can certainly see why she might. Her screen presence is astounding; very few actresses can convey so many different emotions and feelings at once. She begins as an innocent, child-like dancer completely dominated by her mother (Barbara Hershey) and the theater director (Vincent Cassel). Both demand the very best of her and push until, they hope, she performs with no restraint. This pressure pushes Nina to the brink, and to watch her journey there is the true aspiration of this film with Portman boldly leading the way in a style all her own. Supporting her are Hershey doing a nice, subtle job as the ex-ballerina now attempting to find success through her daughter, Cassel as the sexually domineering director who uses sex and other forms of seduction to get the best of his performers, and Mila Kunis in yet another great supporting role that hopefully pushes her through into the realm of lead actress. Playing the dichotomy of Nina, Lily is a free-spirited, charming and loose dancer not so concerned about success as living. The interaction between these two is mesmerizing.Aronofsky has been known for most of his career has a visual master. Films like Requiem For a Dream, The Fountain and The Wrestler all dealt with harsh imagery that stays with the audience after the film ends and Black Swan is no different; it might be his best work yet. Shot in the same style as The Wrestler with a lot of extreme closeups, grainy quality and hand-held camera work, Aronofsky gives the film an off-kilter feeling that is all the more stunning and surprising at the climax. I could continue trying to conjure up words to describe the awesome and enthralling power this film has, but that would be futile. Black Swan is a dazzling, incredibly provocative and mind-bending tale with powerful performances, glorious sets, vividly dark cinematography and breathless direction that brings it all to its rightful conclusion. Hopefully the success of this film ensures Aronofsky for years to come; he is a bright spot amidst the darkness that enshrouds American cinema today.",Null,3,7,22 January 2011
Changeling," Not Eastwood's best, but better than most.
","Clint Eastwood is one of the legends of the silver screen, from his humble beginnings as the Man With No Name in Sergio Leone westerns to Dirty Harry the kick-butt cop. As a director, he has given us some of the finest stories we could ever see, including the Oscar-winning Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, and the war epic twins Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima. With his new film, he explores the dark side of the earlier part of the twentieth century in Tinseltown (Los Angeles). Taken from true events, the story unfolds that a single mother Christine Collins has lost her nine-year old son, Walter. She asks the LAPD to intervene, and about two months later, her son is returned. Then, she says it isn't her son. She never looks back.From the moment the young boy steps off the train, Christine insists to everyone that he is not her son. Unfortunately, the police say she is delusional and just upset. The films leads to the truth of the matter, which is that the corruption in the department has led to them being lackadaisical in their duties. The story moves along fluidly, yet we are never really told the reason that corruption resides.Nevertheless, the film is quite an experience. It looks terrific and really feels like the 1920s in Los Angeles. Angelina Jolie is solid as Christine, yet I felt she seemed more whiny at times than desperate. It just didn't move me as strongly as Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby. The supporting cast is good as well, especially John Malkovich as the pastor eager to help Christine in the fight against the LAPD. What I really wanted was that emotional pull that Eastwood's other films had. This one seemed a bit cold and ruthless, despite that being its subject material. So, I would say to go and see it; it is definitely worth the 140 minutes. As for Oscar time, I can't say for sure that it will wrap up the big ones such as Best Picture, Director or Actress. It wasn't the strongest campaign I've seen, but then again this has been a weaker year than 2007.",8,107,170,31 October 2008
Love and Death," Life in 19th-century Russia; what a joke!
","Woody Allen is famous for his sardonic and existential humor today, but what a shock and delight it must have been for audiences to see him introduce his bleak world-view to us in the 1970s. With films like Sleeper and Love and Death, Allen uses particular contexts and settings to show how his outlook on life is as universal as human beings themselves. No longer set in the dystopian future, Allen shifts to 19th-century Russia as famous writers such as Tolstoy and Dostoevsky during the backdrop of the War of 1812 and serfdom.This is fertile ground for comic opportunity and Allen certainly makes the best of it. His signature stand-up routine finds many victims here and there are some very funny one-liners. Yet, what seems to be even more striking is how much stride Allen made visually between this film and his previous, Sleeper (1973). There is much better cinematography here as well as more striking images, such as the battle scenes and the image of Death moving across an open field. It is obvious Allen was quickly assimilating himself as a filmmaker and it would but 2 years before going on a run very few directors can match. Despite some imperfections, Love and Death is classical Woody Allen: bizarre, morbid, thought-provoking and very funny.",8,0,0,28 July 2010
Walk the Line," A great film all around.
","I really love this film. I never was a fan of Johnny Cash until recently and now I really like him thanks to this film. Joaquin Phoenix is great as Cash and he deserved every award he got. Reese Witherspoon deserved hers, but I think Phoenix had the more rigorous role. Would you rather play a sweet, innocent Christian gospel singer or a depressed, drunk, drug-dependent singer who had marital and family problems? See? I give all the credit in the world to Phoenix for playing the role perfectly. Of course, Phoenix and Witherspoon can both sing very well and I find it amazing that they did it themselves and Phoenix taught himself to play the guitar. The directing was good, but I think Mangold missed some important stuff when he failed to mention that Johnny Cash was truly saved by God. June had a hand in it for sure, but only God could save anybody from the mess Johnny was in. Still, a great film all they way around.",8,0,0,28 March 2006
The Incredible Hulk," A pleasant surprise.
","After seeing Iron Man and really enjoying it, I was a little apprehensive to see another Hulk after the disaster from 2003 otherwise known as Ang Lee's Hulk. This one has better acting, a faster pace, and really good special effects that fit perfectly. Edward Norton is very good, again, as the famed scientist Bruce Banner, who gets mean and green when he gets angry. Liv Tyler is also very good as the damsel in distress, Betty Ross. I thought their scenes together were just as good if not better than the ones between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst in the first two Spider-Man movies. As for the action sequences, they go on a tad too long for my taste, but they look great and are not done over the top. Hulk really looks realistic, as does the Abomination. And, of course, as is being advertised, the ending leaves fans wanting more and salivating for a movie about The Avengers. After the great success of Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, I can honestly say I am ready to join them.",8,1,2,21 June 2008
The Hangover," The 'Citizen Kane' of modern comedies.
","With all due respect to Judd Apatow and his outrageous filmography, The Hangover is probably the best comedy of the decade, maybe the best since The Big Lebowski. What is so good about this film that it was heaped upon with critical and box office acclaim, not to mention a Golden Globe for Best Comedy? Of course there are terrific one-liners and other jokes you will be quoting long after seeing the movie, but there is also the reason for how innovative of a comedy this actually is.A very common plot of many modern comedies involves people getting drunk, going to Las Vegas, letting completely loose before a wedding; these are plot elements that have become so simple and common it is almost impossible to realize just how serious and dangerous they can be. Although the film makers will probably deny this, there is a definite part of this movie that is anti-drug/alcohol. This film shows the true nature of the Vegas lifestyle: crazy, wild and totally unpredictable in terms of what situations you can get yourself into. Certainly no one will see this as something to glean from the movie, but it certainly separates this comedy from all the others.Not to mention the story line of this movie and how it uses the flashback to bring us along. This is a plot technique usually reserved for dramas, thrillers, more 'serious' films. Yet director Todd Phillips and writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore make it work because they take their time setting up the situations, pacing at just the right speed, never punching home the jokes and set-ups like a sitcom. Through a series of interviews and searching, the guys slowly start to unravel that crazy night they have no memory of. This makes it funnier because we learn at the same time the characters do so their reactions are funnier.Of course none of this would be possible without the terrific cast led by the talented Bradley Cooper, proving he can play a multidimensional character. His support group is Ed Helm of The Office, very funny as a whipped dentist and newcomer Zach Galifianakis as the slow but very funny Alan. The groom in distress is Justin Bartha, very strong as Doug and other supporting actors include Heather Graham as a stripper with a heart of gold, Ken Jeong as a mysteriously creepy Asian crime boss, Jeffrey Tambor as the all-understanding father-in-law and Mike Tyson as... himself.With all innovative plot techniques and subtle messages aside, this is a very funny movie. The writing as a strong dark tone to it which makes you laugh but also think about these characters and their motivation. Unlike films that just go for the big laugh like Wedding Crashers, Old School and Anchorman, well this film does too. But it does it in such a fresh and exciting way for comedies, the standard has now been raised.",8,1,3,13 February 2010
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The greatest adventure on film.
","So much more than just an action film, Raiders of the Lost Ark set the standard for any film that required action sequences of any kind. Harrison Ford gives us another iconic character that we can relate to and admire as he faces trial after trial. The supporting cast is very good as well, and the script is full of suspense as it keeps us guessing until the end. Of course the most important part of this film is the direction, and it is here that Spielberg does one of his very best jobs in this reviewer's opinion. What Spielberg does so well is tell the story and set the tone, then let us decide with our own emotions of how to react. Combined with yet another immortal John Williams' score and wonderful photography, it is universally considered to be the greatest adventure on film. It still is.",10,0,1,11 May 2008
Spartacus," Kubrick has been snuffed.
","Make no mistake, Spartacus is a very strong epic and one that deserves to be called one of the best historical epics in American cinema, yet I can't help but wonder what might have been if director Stanley Kubrick was given more control over production. With Kirk Douglas in the starring role as well as producer, he seemed to sort of take over the look and feel of the movie in order to push forth his agenda that he was fighting for. Indeed, because of this, Spartacus has the feeling of more play and light-heartedness than other epics such as Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago.The supporting cast is very strong with Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, and Peter Ustinov all giving great performances and bringing these characters to life. However, Tony Curtis as a minstrel-type slave does not feel right and for the most part feels very out of place with this story. It is obvious with this film that Kubrick had his own ideas on how to present it but was snuffed by the studio system that still loomed above in the early 1960s. After this, which made plenty of money but also made Kubrick upset at Hollywood, he decided to move to England and finance his projects independently. Watch his films after Spartacus and judge for yourself whether he made a wise decision or not.",7,2,6,13 January 2009
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Good, but not great.
","I have now seen this film twice now, and I have to say that I really cannot see what makes this film consistently appear on top 100 film lists as well as being called a tear-jerker. Perhaps I am just not sympathetic enough, but I really never felt that I was going to or should have cried at any moment in the film. This is probably due to the fact that it was intended for children, and it succeeds at doing that. Nevertheless, I wish Spielberg would have made it more accessible to adults as well, especially those who don't care whether or not extra-terrestrial life exists. There are other flaws as well, such as the explanation of why the aliens are one earth, why ET comes back to life after dying, and why the adults consider him so dangerous. Despite all this, there are some great heartwarming moments in it. Most of the acting is good, except for Henry Thomas, who I thought just whined his way through the film. The direction of Spielberg is good as usual, and John Williams' score is timeless as usual. Still, I cannot perceive this film as one of Spielberg's greatest achievements. Overall, I did like it more after seeing it a second time, but I don't see it getting onto my top 100 list anytime soon.",7,1,3,5 May 2008
Casablanca," The best love story of all time
","This is one of my top 10 favorite films, and it is a landmark in Hollywood history. No one may have known it at the time, but Bogart, Bergman, and the rest of the marvelous crew were putting together a near-flawless script by the Epstein brothers as well as superb acting by the leads. A lot has been made about Bogart and Bergman never talking to each other off screen, but I think that only helped their chemistry. Watch the film again and you can't help but wonder if this isn't the best love story duo ever. Every scene together is so heartwarming and tender it grabs your emotions and doesn't let go. Of course, the ending is perfect since true love contains self-sacrifice, and Rick does just that for Ilsa. A remarkable picture that will stand the test of time. 'Here's looking at you, kid.' - Rick Blaine",10,1,3,28 March 2006
Minority Report," One of the best of Spielberg.
","This is what Artificial Intelligence was supposed to be; a well-crafted, interesting and thought-provoking film about the near future and what it might be like. While Spielberg didn't completely fulfill that in his previous film, he remains unable to fail twice as Minority Report succeeds in all aspects. Of course, knowing Spielberg is at the helm and ILM is behind the scenes, this film is visually stunning in every single scene. The futuristic look of Washington DC very cool and sets the tone and mood of this story about a branch of the police force, the PreCrime Unit, that is able to stop crime before it happens. This occurs because of three 'PreCogs,' which are essentially three people that live in a pool of mineral water and see images of the future constantly. The tables turn, however, when Chief John Anderton of the PreCrime unit (Tom Cruise) is accused of a future murder. He goes on a mission to find out the truth, believing he is innocent, and discovers more than he ever hoped for.All plot points aside, this is definitely one of the best science fiction films of the last 25 years. Despite it being visually stunning, it still has characters of great depth and a storyline that covers a lot of ground. The acting is terrific with Cruise giving one of his best performances as the hunter who becomes the hunted. Colin Farrell is strong as a young federal agent dispatched to observe the PreCrime squad, and Max von Sydow is great to watch as the wise old man of this futuristic age. Everything works for this film. The story is intriguing, the acting is believable, and most important, it has the look and feel a near-future society where technology is a huge part of life, but not so much that it becomes ridiculous. As a suspense thriller, as an action film, and as a sci-fi look into the future, Minority Report succeeds and deserves to be called one of the best works of Steven Spielberg.",9,0,1,31 May 2008
Lifeboat," Original and exciting, even by today's standards.
","What a great challenge it must have been for Alfred Hitchcock to make this movie possible. Here we have a story that is stationary, no movement in terms of setting or action and yet with a fine cast and wonderful writing, Hitchcock was able to create a timeless and suspenseful drama dictating what great lengths people are willing to go to in order to survive as well as the goodness of mankind that can shine through.As the story goes, a US ship has just been sunk and we see the remains floating along in the Atlantic and soon stumble across a lavishly dressed woman alone in a lifeboat, a reporter insisting on saving her material in order to project a good story. As more survivors resurface, we meet a whole group of them including a nurse, a radio operator, a crewman and a German who is immediately ostracized by the rest simply because he is from the boat that sunk the survivors' ship. What Hitchcock does in depicting these very different people and how they relate to one another and try to survive amidst the cold, seemingly endless Atlantic Ocean is truly fantastic. This is a set-up that would be exciting and seem original even by today's standards of unlimited special effects potential.What Hitchcock does to maintain the narration moving forward and keep interest alive is not a stretch of realism nor is it far-fetched n its method. Here, simple and solid directing reigns and despite a somewhat anticlimactic ending, I found this to be one of Hitchcock's better movies; maybe one of his ten best. It is engaging, interesting and does a superb job of showing the true colors of people in such a situation. Here, in a boat stranded in the ocean, there are no Americans or Nazis, poor or rich. Everyone is equal and trying to strive to the same goal.",9,4,5,13 May 2009
Chinatown," A remarkable picture.
","Chinatown is and incredible experience, one of the best in film history. The story is captivating and the direction is perfect as the audience begins to figure out what is going on at the same time Jack Nicholson's J.J. Gittes does. In brief, Gittes is a private detective who is investigating alleged affairs between the water commissioner Hollis Mulwray and some woman. As Gittes continues to search, he finds way more than he bargained for including an alluring, mysterious woman with a dark secret, her rich and psychologically powerful father, and a plan that will forever change the future of the city of Los Angeles. Modeled after the classic film noirs of the 1930s and 1940s, Chinatown perfectly captures that era with wonderful sets, terrific acting, smooth directing, and a script hailed today as one of the best ever written. Overall, Chinatown is comparable to The Maltese Falcon and Double Indemnity as one of the best film noirs ever put onto celluloid.",9,1,3,28 March 2008
To Be or Not to Be," A very dark and somewhat non-comical comedy.
","By no means is this movie not funny at all, but it is by all accounts perhaps the most serious movie Ernst Lubitsch ever made. Taking place in Poland during the 'Blitzkreig' of 1939 that jump-started World War II, there is much more satire than screwball in this story, and I have to admit I didn't laugh nearly as much as in Ninotchka or even Trouble in Paradise. Of course, it could be possible Lubitsch wasn't going for the witty laughs. Rather, it seems he was trying to make a serious film about a serious time all the while poking fun at the enemy at the same time.The cast is very good with the beautiful Carole Lombard leading the way in her final role before tragically dying in a plane crash. Jack Benny is rather obnoxious in his role as a hapless Shakespearean actor married to Lombard, but doesn't realize she is having an affair with a soldier he needs to help defeat the Nazis. The story takes many turns that are far too unbelievable especially in scenes about the Nazis and the ending. Still, for fans of Lubitsch, it is possible to see his beautiful touch on this story even if it is murky with so much war dribble.",7,0,1,1 October 2008
I'm Not There," An interesting and insightful interpretation on the icon and the man.
","Todd Haynes new film is certainly ambitious enough as he tries to get under the reasons and actions of the man that was and is Bob Dylan, arguably the greatest and influential American musician ever. Six different actors portray Dylan at different times in his life all the while trying to figure out exactly what kind of man he really was. Cate Blanchett gives the film's best performance as the most interesting aspect of Dylan's life, when he was touring in England and recording Blonde on Blonde in 1965-66. Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, Marcus Carl Franklin, Ben Whishaw, and Richard Gere all give solid performances as the other identities Dylan passed through.Still, what keeps this story moving and fascinating is the man himself, Bob Dylan, who was a folk-singer, rock n' roll rebel, distant country singer and mesmerizing enigma all rolled into one. Haynes does a good job of constantly moving back and forth between each character, although the Richard Gere sequence is the least interesting and goes a little too long. Still, for anyone who has ever been interested in Bob Dylan, this is a must-see as well as a very interesting and insightful interpretation of the icon as well as the man.",8,0,1,1 October 2008
The Big Lebowski," Completely original and unforgettable.
","There never was before and there probably never will be a film quite like The Big Lebowski. It has a typical film noir story arc mixed with a couple of stoner characters and a hip setting in the early 1990s Los Angeles that creates a great atmosphere to watch the action unfold. This is Raymond Chandler on vacation; relaxed and willing to stretch out and let loose.When it first premiered, this was quite a misunderstood movie. People couldn't believe that this was written, produced and directed by the same team who made that brilliant crime thriller Fargo from two years before. Yet, this kind of movie shows how creative and daring the Coen brothers are. They don't try to make just one kind of film; they branch out and try different ideas until they hit upon one that works. And they had to know from the start that a character like the Dude would work. With the wonderfully laid back Jeff Bridges in the title role, the Dude abides as one of the greatest of all movie characters, perhaps the Coens have ever written and one that will be remembered for ages.Of course, where would the Dude be without his able partner, Walter Sobchak, that Vietnam-crazy, screaming Jew who takes his bowling almost as serious as his religion. John Goodman gives perhaps his most memorable performance and it is a great one; thoroughly entertaining as well as very funny. And then there is Donny, played with sweet naiveté by Steve Buscemi. Donny doesn't do or say much, but I think he represents the audience; just there for the ride and seeing the story unfold only because he enjoys the company of the Dude and Walter despite his constant yelling at him.This is a movie that could be discussed and analyzed forever in terms of its plot, dream sequences and ways it adheres to old-fashion storytelling with modern film making. But perhaps the Coens simply wanted it enjoyed on its most basic level; as the story of a man called Dude who had his rug peed on and sought destitute for it. And that is because that rug really tied the room together. This is a completely original and unforgettable movie that must be seen by any Coen brothers or modern movie fan.",9,2,4,26 December 2009
Fury," FUBAR in the ranks
","In this post 9/11 era, war has reinvented itself as a morally righteous act, no matter the outcome or manner in which it is executed. The movies have reinforced this notion with films like Fury, a World War II adventure attempting to scale the heights of Saving Private Ryan or Platoon though ultimately regressing to its own variation of gratuitous carnage and destruction. Such films seem to have a chip on their shoulders; how does one portray an event so ubiquitous to modern culture and so thoroughly researched by historians as to give us a new angle and understanding of the dimensions of such an atrocious existence? This answer may never be reached, although Fury does make a noble endeavor to proclaim the bravery and courage of the American military, in this case the US Armored Division.Writer-director David Ayer, who has progressed from writing pulpy action scripts like The Fast and the Furious and S.W.A.T. to those of a more serious tone, nevertheless cannot seem to forget his roots as an action first, character second kind of filmmaker. Ayer has constantly focused on the 'brotherhood' of his characters, but that may be all he has to say about them. The four men occupying the tank in this film say they have been together since the Allied invasion of Africa, yet little else is mentioned about this. Furthermore, the script borrows far too much material outright from Saving Private Ryan, right down to the main characteristics of the main roles. Brad Pitt's Wardaddy is the quiet, unspoken father figure whose troops are willing to die with him (just like Tom Hanks). Shia LaBeouf is the Bible-quoting gunman who seems to have almost supernatural-like aim (just like Barry Pepper). And Logan Lerman is the young, totally inexperienced new addition to the tank who has not been trained for such an assignment but ultimately proves himself through a baptism of fire (just like Jeremy Davies). Does Ayer believe most of those who go to see this will have never seen Spielberg's earlier film, or does he simply not care about the similarities? It may be that he feels the message of such a story overrides any other details, ultimately rendering them unnecessary and minimal. However, other sequences are either taken directly from Saving Private Ryan and other such films, or seem to have little to no basis in reality or logic. One that many will call to mind is when Wardaddy and the newly hired Norman invade a German apartment after taking the town. They stake out the room, find two young women, force them to cook breakfast until the rest of the tank crew, drunk and disorderly, barge in and cause discomfort and awkwardness. What does Ayer believe this sequence says about the relationship between American soldiers and German civilians? The film says nothing, although given the manner in which it is shot, this seems to be a badge of honor rather than a criticism. Whatever the director's attitude towards such scenarios, the actors certainly give their fullest involvement. Pitt has ensured his lasting stardom through roles like this: brash, tough, yet endearing to the younger generation looking up to him. LaBeouf, for the first time in quite awhile, shows his true acting ability when he can remain focused and under control. His role is not huge but he plays it as serious and focused as can be expected. Lerman may be the weakest link, overreaching in his portrayal of an inexperienced, frightened clerk thrust into the deepest and ugliest recesses of the battlefront. He has his tough moments to be sure, but ultimately becomes somewhat cartoonish. The strongest aspect of the film is its action sequences, which may be all Ayer and audiences will care about or take from watching the film. Certainly they leave one completely entranced and utterly aghast. The showdown between our beloved American tank and an advanced German Panzer is fully engrossing and great fun to watch. Yet, is it supposed to be this enjoyable? The final sequence as well shows our heroes surrounded by an SS brigade trapped in their broken-down tank as they attempt to fight their way out, willing to die but only by taking as many Germans with them as possible. Such scenes ultimately begin to feel like video game set-ups. We cheer quietly and feel relieved at the sight and sound of every enemy soldier whose head explodes or is cut down by bullets at such a speed as to look like a fight scene from Star Wars. The greatest difference between Ayer and Steven Spielberg is that Spielberg never tries to excite the viewer through carnage. He is able to do this with less emphasis on grotesque shots of mutilated bodies and fiery crashes and more of a focus on the psychological and spiritual effects of war on the individual. Fury, for all its artistic merit and genuine entertainment, would rather bombard the audience with gore than invite a thought-provoking stimulus. For Ayer, the humanity of war remains out of reach, or perhaps not near at all. This film ultimately tells us war is hell; such a statement is one of the great understatements of history. Will future war films, with all the knowledge and understanding of hindsight at their fingertips, ever give us more than such a simplistic denouement or a visual repetition of events which need not be pounded into the brain?",Null,12,26,21 October 2014
Fight Club," Disturbing and brutal, yet has a distinct message.
","After viewing Fight Club, a lot of ideas will run through your mind. This is the sign of a great film. It doesn't just entertain and hold you in suspense; any simple, ordinary film can do that. David Fincher's extraordinary tale about male aggression and the oppression we face from everyday marketing and materialism takes all this to another level, pushing us to the very maximum that we are able to handle. It all starts out so simple and dark: a nameless, obsolete insurance worker sleepwalks through his life all the while working a job he hates to buy crap he doesn't need. He needs a change and the audience knows this as well. For the first 30-40 minutes of the movie, we get a dark tone of political and social satire that really makes you think of what kind of film this is. Then, it all changes. Just like Edward Norton's character, our entire experience is jolted when Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden steps into the frame. For the rest of the running time, we are thrown and tossed about back and forth, helplessly watching this confusion and chaos bring itself to light. At times, we have to scratch our heads as it can get carried out of hand, but never does this film get off track and fall into obscurity. There is a clear message here, although it may have multiple explanations. Cinematically, this is one of the most brilliantly-shot movies in recent memory. Fincher's directing style is so clever and slick that it perfectly complements the settings and the acting. That being said, the acting is some of the best you will see in any movie. Brad Pitt is mesmerizing and easy to hate at the same time, and Helena Bonham Carter gives a strong supporting role. However, it is the work of Edward Norton that makes this movie memorable and stays with you long after it is over. In every scene he is in, and there are a lot of them, Norton perfectly captures the attitude and feelings of the Narrator. At first, he is depressed and out of touch with reality. As the story moves on, he becomes more aware and self-destructive. The audience also becomes more involved as we wonder where this could lead. Perhaps the most striking thing about Fight Club is that the premise is entirely plausible. It is not ridiculous at all to think that such an idea could spring up and alter the course of many peoples' lives. Still, this film provides more warning than suggestions. Simply put, this film is not just for entertainment value. There is much more here than meets the eye. Of course, not everyone will take it for anything other than face value. But, if you look closer and really try to understand this fascinating story, you will see a message; just don't be able to decipher it anytime soon.",10,1,3,3 June 2008
Citizen Kane," If there had to be one, it would be 'Kane.'
","I don't like to number films and name one the 'greatest film of all time.' To me, every film is different and unique in their own way. But, if there had to one that was, it would be Citizen Kane. Orson Welles' genius shines through in all aspects. It is filled with remarkable acting, especially by Agnes Moorehead and Welles, as well as cinematography and camera work that is considered to be the standard today. Of all films I have seen, this is the one that I simply enjoy to watch the most. It isn't perfect, but it is so groundbreaking and exemplary that I can't help but be in awe no matter how many times I see it. See it simply for the story and acting. If you have already, see it for the technical achievements. Each time you watch it, it will captivate you.",10,0,3,15 January 2008
The Birth of a Nation," Within its context, it is a timeless landmark.
","Anyone that is interested in classic film or film history must watch at least once The Birth of a Nation, perhaps the most important film ever made because it was the first true film; put together piece by piece, scene by scene, it tells a story. And this isn't just a one-reel, 10-minute story. This is a 3-hour plus epic that begins before the Civil War and follows through into the Reconstruction.There is a lot going on here, perhaps more than needed. Despite this, The Birth of a Nation remains a historic landmark, something that will always need to be dealt with. The fact that this was all shot with one camera, one cameraman, and without a script but visually set up in director DW Griffith's head makes this even more astounding of an achievement. However, it will always be remembered for its severe racism, especially in today's society which treats this idea in entertainment as pure evil. As a matter of fact, there is hardly any racist content until the third act, if you don't count the use of white actors in blackface. Griffith spends 2/3 of the movie setting up the story, showing through the Northern Stonemans and the Southern Camerons the immense differences in our nation at the time and how the war brought the two sides closer and then farther.That is to see it from a historical view. From a cinematic view, you have to stop and really think about what you are seeing. As someone who has grown up in the technological-savvy era of the 1990s, I have no idea what it would be like to live in the early 20th century and see for the first time an account of an important event on a big wall. It must have been truly remarkable, perhaps so much that most people didn't notice the racist content. Indeed, Griffith pioneered innumerable techniques that are so common today, we don't even think about how they are done. The idea of parallel editing between the Klan riding and people defending in a cabin shocks us today because of how the Klan is portrayed. Back then, it was a mind-blowing experience that seemed impossible to understand. Yet, Griffith did it and it is because we are so used to moving images that many, if any, people see this today they will automatically disregard it as pure racist garbage.There are only two rules to keep when deciding to view The Birth of a Nation. First, understand that it is the single-most important production because it is the blueprint for every other movie, TV show and other images on a camera done since. Second, understand the sheer racism of it and have some sympathy for DW Griffith. I believe that he was blinded to the impact this would have. Not even he could have surmised that this would stir up hatred, reinstate the Klan, and cause blacks to respond in their own version. These facts alone point to something greater than the offensive material: Griffith has and always will be the Father of Cinema.",Null,1,2,6 July 2009
Inglourious Basterds," A fake war, a real director.
","As if we needed any reminding, Quentin Tarantino remains as one of the five best directors working in movies today. His previous film, Death Proof, billed together with a gory zombie movie was more than just an entertaining 70's schlock movie. It was a tribute to all the films of that time as well to show that Tarantino could direct a new kind of action movie.Here, he shows he can direct a new kind of movie altogether: the war fantasy. There is as much historical accuracy here as there is in Hogan's Heroes. Yet, that is the point and anyone who would dislike the movies simply because of that is missing it altogether. Tarantino is doing what Steven Spielberg did with Raiders of the Lost Ark, rewriting history as more entertaining and more to his liking. Here, history occurs as Tarantino (and possibly many of us) would like to see it, which makes it more fun to take in and all the more beautiful.The opening sequence is astonishing: long, tense and utterly engrossing. We know there is going to be a wild climax, we just don't know what or when. Tarantino feeds off our anticipation and goes all the way with it. Indeed, nearly every sequence feels like that. This being Tarantino, it will be very violent and shocking, but it is in a whole new way. I cannot think of one moment when it is boring or uninteresting. There is a lot of French and German, but even that dialog is entertaining to listen to. It seems that QT has evolved tremendously in his writing, going from tons of pop-culture references to more mature and deep talking; these people have something to say. As for his love of the cinema, it is never more apparent than here, as we get an enormous, over-the-top climax in a movie theater that I know Tarantino was enjoying in his head as he wrote it down. References to German cinema abound and he treats it with respect despite what it looks like.All in all, this is QT's best work since Pulp Fiction; dazzling, amazing and utterly mind-blowing. His cast rises to the occasion with Brad Pitt and Eli Roth hamming it up as the leaders of the Basterds. Of course, I must point out Christoph Waltz as the Nazi Col. Landa, so ferocious and frightening he deserves an Oscar nod. Just as good is the stunning Melanie Laurent, a Jewish girl who runs the theater the Nazis intend to celebrate in. QT films her with all the affection and love a director can and it all the more increases her performance to new heights. A fake war, but a real director. And one I hope to watch for years to come, no matter how inaccurate it may be.",10,2,10,27 August 2009
Amistad," Solid Spielberg.
","Here we have another historical epic made in the same vein as Schindler's List, only more discreet and soft. While Spielberg really took it to the audience in giving them as authentic an experience as possible for his Holocaust picture, here he sits back and lets us take the experience for ourselves. The stories are similar here, as we watch two groups of people be completely controlled by outside forces simply for the benefit of the force controlling them. Of course we sympathize with them, but Spielberg takes it farther and gives us a rather unforgiving portrait of the slaves' journey to America. Starting in Africa, they are captured by Portuguese slave traders and then sold to the Spanish ship La Amistad. The journey from Africa to Cuba is the most horrific as we watch the inhumane sleeping quarters and food rations these people are given. The film then settles into a courtroom drama mode as we watch Morgan Freeman and Matthew McConaughey fight for their freedom against the government led by newly reelected president Martin Van Buren. Not always history savvy, the film still manages to portray these iconic American figures as someone we can listen and relate to. This brings me to the technology aspects of the film which more often than not are a success. The acting is great with Freeman doing his usual stellar performance and Djimon Hounsou being completely convincing of his slave leader character. However, I was most impressed with Anthony Hopkins as former president John Quincy Adams and McConaughey as the young lawyer that lead the case. McConaughey in particular needs to do more films like this to become the true movie star he has the potential for. All these chick flicks with Kate Hudson and Jennifer Lopez are an insult to the magnificent work he does here. The direction is steady by Spielberg and the writing keeps us interested for the most part. While a little long at times and maybe not completely accurate, this is still a film well worth seeing and a great piece of American history frozen forever in the reels of cinema.",7,0,1,21 May 2008
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Surprisingly hilarious.
","This being the first Judd Apatow film I have seen, I wasn't sure what to expect from this knowing that his forte is gross-out humor with a touch of a heartwarming message. After seeing Forgetting Sarah Marshall, I am pleased to say that is exactly what you get. It was gross sure enough, but there have been far worse. What is so surprising is the amount of heart and soul there is to this story. It really focuses in on Jason Segel's character as he tries to overcome his heartbreak and finds new challenges along the way. It is hilarious at times, as well as sad. Overall, though, it was quite enjoyable and makes a great date movie for guys and girls. The script was great, but Mila Kunis and Russell Brand really make this story work. Each gives a different type of character that you can love and feel sympathy for. Everyone is great, but these two stand out. So, go see this movie if only for the humor and the touching love story that has been missing in Hollywood all these years.",8,2,7,28 April 2008
12 Angry Men," Simply engrossing.
","12 Angry Men is the tailor-made type of movie that was common in the 1950s but has become non-existent today. It is all dialog, relies heavily on acting, and is short but sweet in its running time. All this adds up to one of the most satisfying watching experiences available in the movies. Henry Fonda plays a juror who has a 'reasonable doubt' that the boy they are trying might not be guilty. From beginning to end, no matter who is standing against him, he continues to vote not guilty.Slowly, but surely, Juror #8 begins to raise questions and doubts about the validity of the witnesses boy being and the evidence against the boy being accused of his father. Soon, more than just one juror thinks he may not be guilty, and this leads to some fantastic drama.For this type of movie, the two most important issues were handled very well. The acting is top-notch all around, especially Fonda as the quiet, gentle man who sees something wrong with how most of the jury takes the evidence blindly. Lee J. Cobb also sticks out as Juror #3, a man with severe personal problems that tend to influence his decision. The script is tight but very good at exploring all areas of the judicial system and the stereotypes many of us have about it. All in all, this movie very openly discusses the importance of life and how when it hangs in the balance of a group of men's hands, it should not be rushed into but rather thought out and analyzed.Sidney Lumet does an excellent job of pacing the movie and keeping the suspense all throughout right to the final shot. It isn't a movie everyone will enjoy, but for those who want something more out of their movies, 12 Angry Men says something and then some. One of the best court-room dramas ever made.",9,0,0,9 September 2008
The Notebook," A touching story.
","The best part about The Notebook, just like Message in a Bottle and A Walk to Remember, is the story taken from a Nicholas Sparks novel. Sparks is so good at taking simple love stories and expanding them to mean so much to us that they become true tear-jerkers. While I didn't cry during this film, I was truly touched by the story of two people trying to come together with every obstacle imaginable trying to stop them. Ryan Gosling is strong as the head romantic man and Rachel McAdams is so beautiful and charming and lovable as Allie, it is hard to look at anything but her in every scene she is in. However, in my opinion, the young lovers' scenes don't compare to the power and emotion of those with James Garner and Gina Rowlands, playing the older Noah and Allie. As Allie got older, she began to lose her memory and now Noah is trying to help her remember who he is and what they used to have. The scene where she goes to a frightened rage because she doesn't know where she is is truly moving. Still, the best part is the last scene, where they die on the same bed together holding each other's hands. That is the perfect picture of true love. They had differences and complications, but they loved each other; it was that simple. It may not pack the emotional wallop some are looking for, but it is still a well-worthy film to see and one of the best love stories in modern film-making.",7,1,3,19 February 2008
"I Love You, Man"," Charming and sweet, gross and funny.
","Paul Rudd, one of the best comic actors in work today, does some of his best work as Peter Klaven, a man engaged to the beautiful and bubbly Zooey, played wonderfully by Rashida Jones, who has a severe lack of guy buddies to hang out with or for that matter be the best man in his wedding. His family decides to help out and send him on a bunch of exotic 'man-dates' with different guys that don't seem to work too well. Then, Sydney Fife comes along. Portrayed by the very funny Jason Segel, Sydney is the antithesis of Peter: bold, daring, and utterly and completely acceptable of his inner manhood. He and Peter hit it off due to their common lack of male friends as well as a love for the band Rush.Despite the simple premise and the lack of surprise and originality, Rudd and Segel make it pay off by just making us laugh as well as care about these characters. Rudd, in particular is so good at timing and understanding the basics of being funny and sweet at the same time. You really feel for this guy and want him to end up happy as well as Zooey and Sydney. Director/co-writer John Hamburg does a great job with getting the most out of his incredible cast as well as making the most out of a somewhat lame plot. After the many comedies we have seen over the years involving platonic men relationships such as Superbad and Pineapple Express, this is the most endearing and touching. I'm sure a lot of guys out there feel like Peter, and perhaps seeing this film will inspire them to go out and make a new friend. For that reason alone, I encourage anyone to go see this charming, gross, sweet but ultimately very funny movie.",8,1,4,23 March 2009
Ed Wood," A great film about a poor director.
","A masterpiece of weird cinema, Tim Burton has made his own masterpiece that I don't believe will ever be topped. Taking the true story about a man who was considered the worst of his field, Burton creates a creepy, bizarre, almost disturbing world of the underbelly of Hollywood in the 1950s. This was the part most people don't remember but it was there. The story is incredible as we watch this enthusiastic, positive man try to get his dreams accomplished at any cost.All elements work perfectly together here. The acting is top-notch with Johnny Depp giving maybe his best performance ever, Martin Landau stealing the show in an Oscar-winning performance as the legendary vampire actor Bela Lugosi, along with Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Bill Murray and many others giving real, believable performances in bringing this strange group of people to life. What may be the most amazing part about this movie is how well Burton is able to create the remaking of Wood shooting his movies. Every scene feels real, vivid, and completely accurate.In short, this is the best Burton movie as well as the best Burton/Depp collaboration. In a way this is so different from anything Burton did before or has done since. This is the most sincere, realistic movie he has done and while I admire his off-beat brand of film-making, I think this is one of the best films of the 1990s. See it for Burton, Depp, or Landau. But also see it because it is a great film about a poor director.",10,0,0,30 August 2008
500 Days of Summer," The most perfect visualization of relationships ever put on film.
","Some films feel like genuine masterpieces that cannot nor ever will be topped by similar films. 500 Days of Summer is such a film; it is so perfectly crafted in its writing, direction, acting, editing and other major departments that after seeing it one feels off kilter, wondering if they had seen a fictional movie (as the title cards read in the opening) or a portal in which the inner workings of a young man and his quest for true love was connected directly to the audience. So strong and powerful was my emotional reaction and connection to this film, it could in many ways alter forever my view of relationships. Is that good or bad? As an indie-budget production, there are really only two sections that can make or break this type of film: writing and acting. The script by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber is as close to perfect as I've ever seen in any film of any genre. The dialogue feels completely accurate and true to the context of the situations of the characters, the situations themselves are real and totally believable and the nonlinear narrative works extremely well in bringing the audience not only into a deeper sympathy with the Joseph Gordon-Levitt character but also in convincing us that a number of these scenes may be dreams. First-time director Marc Webb keeps the tricks to a minimum, using only what is necessary to support the story and not divert from it. The film is tight in its pace, which builds the tension and emotion all the more.This now brings us to the acting which is, needless to say, flawless. Gordon-Levitt has been a star-in-the-making for a while now but combining this performance with his in Christopher Nolan's Inception proves he is truly one of the best young actors of this generation. He so perfectly handles both the funny and serious moments of Tom Hansen's journey through love, completely believable in every single frame. He is a nice guy so we root for him, but his pain is visceral and tender so we identify with him. He creates one of the best protagonists I have ever seen in a movie. Zooey Deschanel is an actress I have loved ever since she played the perky, blonde singing elf in Elf. However, her game has been raised significantly from such trash as Failure to Launch. She creates a sympathetic character as well but in an entirely different way. Summer is a woman with many events in her life that would lead to her feeling about relationships the way she does. Therefore, it is understandable that she would do what she does in this film. Yet, there is no excuse given to properly and completely understand who and why she does what she does. We only get glimpses; we see her through Tom's eyes and despite her great beauty and quirky personality, there is always the feeling that something deeper lingers below. Needless to say, the chemistry between the two leads is something to behold. It may be a stretch to compare them to legends such as Bogart/Bacall or Grant/Hepburn but I felt completely comfortable and enchanted by both of them, together and individually.Getting down to it, why is this quite simply the best portrayal of relationships ever put to celluloid? Many would question that statement and it may not be true, but it is most certainly true for this generation that Tom and Summer represent. Here are two people on different paths that happen to cross. Is it fate or coincidence? Each has different views of that and by the end their views are slightly askew. The film would say that it's a little of both. I think that is the best statement the writers and director could make. I have heard many detractors of the film say that it is too sad, that Summer is an unsympathetic person and the ending is completely false. I would simply remark that life is quite often too sad, Summer is sympathetic in a much different way than most romantic-comedy girls and the ending rang true in the sense that Tom's journey isn't over. Many, if not all, guys have been in Tom's shoes. This makes it the best story about love for guys. It also makes it the type of film that when you see it, you feel changed inside.The vast majority of films in this genre are totally dead and unrealistic. Films like Adventureland and 500 Days of Summer show that with the right script and the right cast, a story can be told that is funny, sad, smart and completely, utterly, totally, indubitably: perfect.",10,8,14,20 July 2010
Juno," A superb indie film that is comparable to any major production.
","After seeing Juno, I couldn't help but wonder why the credits were so colorful and uniquely shaped. Then I remembered that this was an indie film. Funny, it doesn't play like one. For all that has been said about independent films and their right in Hollywood, I have seen a few that are good (Little Miss Sunshine) and others that are great (Garden State). Juno is, in my opinion, one of the better ones to come out the past decade. The key here, like in most films, is the main character and the writing. Ellen Page as Juno MacGuff is incredibly good. At a mere 4'11', she looks the part and has the witty tongue and charming face to go with it. From the opening scene with the chair to the final scene with Paulie, we love her and only want the best for her. While most of that can be attributed to Page's excellent performance, a large amount of credit must be given to first-time screenwriter Diablo Cody. Here is a premise which has been done before in many different ways, and there are so many instances which could have led this film to be only sub par or good. Cody, though, walks the line and doesn't take a side on teen pregnancy. Instead, she focuses in on the path to pregnancy and birth. It is humorous, sad, and heartwarming. This film charmed nearly all the critics and most fans, so I expected it to receive at least 3 Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Actress, and Screenplay (which it did). Overall, this is a great film that gives marvelous insight to a more personal problem of teens in America. Never before has it been this mainstream, and never before has it been this touching. A truly great film, indie or not.",9,2,10,22 January 2008
Match Point," Woody Allen goes deeper and darker than ever.
","Match Point must be a pivotal turn in Woody Allen's career, for it is nothing like his previous work yet still maintains that unique style he is so loved for. There are definite elements that echo Allen's previous films Crimes and Misdemeanors and Interiors, but there is also a Hitchcockian flair that raises the stakes and the tension to a degree far above what is usually expected of Woody Allen.Allen has said this may be the best film he has made because everything simply 'fell in... I caught a lot of breaks.' Indeed, nearly all aspects of this film are in top form. The cast is superb, led by the stylish and passionate Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, brilliant as the reckless and amoral Chris willing to go to any length to please any and all desires. Emily Mortimer is sunny and sympathetic as Chris's wife Chloe, whose own life is filled with simple pleasures of love, marriage, children and family. Scarlett Johansson is also quite effective as the femme fatale in white Nola Rice who is instrumental in this plot. The supporting cast, photography, editing and art design also merit high praise.So why is this such a departure for the usual Woody Allen? First of all, it is set in upper-crust London rather than the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. This allows for some stunning sets of big flats, estates and beautiful countrysides. There is also more of a dark undertone to this story than even what is expected of Woody Allen. Of course he is the perennial pessimist, but he delves into nihilism in some sequences and all you can do is look, shocked and amazed.Because there is such a different feel to this film, I would recommend this to anyone who is not a Woody Allen fan as a warm-up. It is very entertaining, keeping you on the edge wondering what will happen next and also pondering what should happen and how it will. This is a conversation starter for sure, but it also is wonderful to look at and definitely stays with you after it ends. Agree or don't agree, one cannot deny Woody's deft ability to provoke and entertain.",10,0,1,26 August 2010
Zodiac," Contains the spirit of Graysmith's obsession.
","Some might say David Fincher is an obsessive film director. He is notorious for doing dozens of takes for specific scenes, often frustrating actors and crew. He is also one of the most innovative and methodically successful directors in recent memory. Following similar material used in his previous sinister masterpiece Seven, Fincher takes his skills to the mostly real world by portraying the infamous Zodiac Killer of the late 1960s and early 1970s that paralyzed the San Francisco area and eventually the United States.There are many theories and myths surrounding the Zodiac Killer and especially the author who has given perhaps the most detailed and complete account of the multiple incidents. The character of Robert Graysmith, played with charming angst by the remarkably chirpy Jake Gyllenhaal, is the main focus of the investigation team as he went on to write two books on the killings. However, Fincher wisely spreads his net wider, also including the head investigator (Mark Ruffalo) and a key journalist who was contacted by the Zodiac (an incredible Robert Downey Jr.) All the acting is quite wonderful, especially Downey as a drunken and paranoid man driven to loss by the case. All of them succeed best in portraying obsession, the main theme of this film.Obsession has been a trademark of David Fincher films, be it attempting to kill a terrifying alien, a serial killer using the seven deadly sins as his MO or trying to revolutionize humanity through revitalized masculinity. Never is this more fully realized or better handled than in this film, which makes a strong case of being Fincher's best. It is so methodical, so professionally paced that despite its long running time it is never boring; every scene is necessary to create a plethora of characters that are individuals as well. It is remarkable to see Fincher subvert his own genre clichés here as we never get the various scenes you would expect in a serial killer film. Thus, you are constantly guessing.With obsession being the main target, we witness its consequences on the investigators and their personal lives. Often it is unpleasant and yet refuses to go away. The film ends best it can: ambiguously. Zodiac remains a mystery, one that will continue to boggle minds and challenge notions. Yet, despite whatever flaws Graysmith's research may have, he has done an incredible sacrifice of willingly giving up a huge portion of his life to better understand this horrific incident. For unknown reasons, he persevered at remarkable costs. Never have I seen a film that embraces its protagonist's spirit so well. Fincher does so here.",10,1,5,28 February 2008
The Prestige," Absolutely engrossing.
","The Prestige is a rare film in its own right for the simple fact that it completely engrosses the audience into the story for nearly the entire 130 minute running time and refuses to let go until the finale is revealed. What starts out simple enough turns into a story so complex and layered, it requires multiple viewings to catch everything. First off, the acting must be convincing to keep the audience paying attention, which it pulls off tremendously. Hugh Jackman carries his role very well, Michael Caine is a pleasure to watch, and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson also hold their own. The best performance, though, is that of Christian Bale, who also plays the most volatile and eccentric character. Every scene he is in he dominates and it is pretty difficult to pay attention to anything but him.As the story unfolds, we find out a rivalry has come between Jackman and Bale, and they continue to sneak into each other's shows as well as pull dirty tricks in order to learn the other's secrets and ruin him. This is the bulk of the film, and the last 20-30 minutes try and bring everything to light. Many fans have argued that this film cheats with its climax and that director/co-writer Christoper Nolan does this to duck out of anything to complicated or difficult. Those who do, however, are looking at it all wrong. Nolan gives us even more questions after the film concludes, and it takes multiple viewings to understand all the interactions and motivations of each character. Even after you may understand what actually occurred in the story, questions will still raise in your mind about the clarity and realism of these conclusions.In short, this is a near-masterpiece from one of the most talented directors this generation. Nolan is working with incredible powers of the cinema here. The entire plot is told completely out of order, yet it is never confusing or convoluted. Everything here holds up, and while questions certainly will be raised about the nature of the story, no one can doubt the undeniable storytelling ability of Christopher Nolan. It is mostly for entertainment, but it also shows what bitter hatred and obsession with revenge can do to a man. This is truly film making at its finest art form.",9,2,3,17 July 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Pure Tim Burton.
","Sleepy Hollow is visually stunning, filled with great sets and a perfect mood to capture the horror and creepiness of the situation. Tim Burton is a master of this genre, and he uses his skills with special effects to give some really effective scenes involving the Headless Horseman chasing down people and taking their heads. What is different about Washington Irving's legend is the story. Burton takes the famed character Ichabod Crane, and turns him from a gangly, unsightly school teacher to a mild-mannered, handsome constable who wants to use modern-day techniques to discover murderers and cause of death. Johnny Depp is very good, as usual, playing Crane as a smart intellectual who sometimes lets his fears and emotions get in the way of his work. Christina Ricci is good as well, but looks to be about only 12 here. What doesn't work here, like many of Burton's films, is the story. The opening quarter is very scary and suspenseful and pulls you right in. The last fifteen minutes or so really drop off and don't really take the audience any further. I was expecting a bigger twist here, since this is done by the man who wrote Se7ven. Still, this is a scary thrill-ride that feeds the emotions but not the brain. If only Burton would start doing that, he might be one of the best in Hollywood instead of one of the better.",7,0,0,21 June 2008
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The End of All Things.
","For Stanley Kubrick, perhaps it was better to laugh at the problems of the world than to dread them. That certainly was the case here as Kubrick adapted Peter George's nuclear war novel Red Alert. However, Kubrick was wise enough to take this rather serious subject and force it under some very funny situations that for a minute take you away from the actual danger of the realities of nuclear war.From a cinematic point of view, this is just about perfect. The acting is spot-on, from George C. Scott's right-wing, hawk Gen. Turgidson, to Sterling Hayden's mad-cap General Ripper, to Peter Sellers' triple performance as Captain Mandrake, President Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove. Sellers, in particular gives one of the greatest performances in film as he flawlessly transits from character to character and is so believable as an uptight, downright British officer, a neurotic and plain American president, and a creepy yet brilliant former Nazi scientist. Nearly every line is memorable and perfectly captures an era where paranoid reigned supreme and you were instructed to trust no one.As for Stanley Kubrick, he is obviously poking fun at the sheer lunacy of this situation, yet he shows some deft seriousness as well. Sure, there is a better way to handle this, but there is no wrong in trying to save your own skin. Take it as you will, but there is no doubt that Kubrick has created one of the most inventive, memorable, and timeless films in American cinema. No matter what the state of world affairs is, Dr. Strangelove will always be significant.",10,1,2,15 January 2009
MASH," You're a prisoner of war, you just don't know it.
","MASH is a masterpiece, plain and simple for at least two reasons. First of all, it defies nearly every cliché and conventional method of portraying war and suffering on the screen. These surgeons being surveyed here (Hawkeye Pierce and Trapper John McIntyre), are so radical and unrestrained in their behavior that the film practically questions whether or not we should root for them. Yet, we do, mostly due to the charismatic and likable performances by Donald Sutherland and Elliot Gould, respectively and the style of Robert Altman's direction (more on that later).Altman, who had previously worked mainly in television, came to the film with original ideas and outrageous methods of stylizing the material. In fact, the screenwriter became so outraged with the lack of dialog and story in his script being used in the film that he demanded his name be removed (he later won an Oscar). However, Altman stands alone as the creative force driving together all the tiny subplots and episodic happenings into a fabulously entertaining and subversive movie.This leads to the second reason of why MASH is a masterpiece: it's hilarious. A film like this we don't expect to be anywhere near as funny or engaging as Altman made this one to be. Yet, it is only the politically-incorrect humor that maintains our interest and emotional pull. We cannot believe the horrors of this war, thus we laugh to remain sane and remind ourselves of our humanity. The characters do the same.This intimate connection with the group of officers, surgeons and nurses along with Altman's inventive way of constant zooms and camera movement put us right in the midst of the 4077th MASH unit. And it all comes down to the big game being played between the surgeons and the generals from a rival unit. Hilarity ensues, we laugh, question why we laugh and realize that war may be hell but suicide is painless. So is laughter.",9,0,3,24 June 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," An incredible mix of multiple genres.
","Guillermo del Toro's fantastic film, Pan's Labyrinth, is part fantasy, part war story. And I don't think anyone else could have mixed the two together so well. The visual images are just stunning in every way. The mix of CGI and puppets make for the fantasy world to seem just as realistic as the real world. The acting is top-notch, especially by the little girl, Ivana Baquero, and the brutal, evil military captain, played by Sergi Lopez. The strongest part, though, is del Toro's storytelling ability as he flawlessly takes us between parallel worlds until they collide together in unspeakable terms. Be warned, this is not for children or anyone squeamish to violence in any way. There are multiple scenes of graphic violent behavior, yet it all is completely necessary to show how evil the real world can actually be. The ending may disappoint some viewers, but after pondering it for awhile, I found it to be the right choice, as well as truly beautiful and moving. This is truly a tour de force movie, mixing multiple genres into its blend and bringing out something truly magnificent. Undoubtedly one of the best films of this decade, and maybe the best foreign film since City of God.",9,1,5,2 July 2008
Knocked Up," An interesting blend of comedy and sincerity.
","It has been about four years since Judd Apatow burst onto the mainstream scene as a comedic director with funnier and more touching things to say than practically anyone else out there. He made his mark with The 40-Year Old Virgin, but this is a more ambitious and sensitive film that is really unlike any other comedy. Apatow's discovery, Seth Rogen, is given free reign here to show off all his comedic chops as Ben Stone, a lazy slacker whose life consists of partying with his roommates and working on a nude alert website for movies. Katherine Heigel, in her break-out role, is very sweet and likable as Allison, a career girl focused on going nowhere but to the top.However, despite all that these two don't have in common, Apatow focuses more on what they do, and here they meet up at a club and realize that they both love to have a good time which is not limited to a one-night stand. Still, eight weeks later, Ben is shocked to hear from Allison and even more so when she tells him that she is pregnant and he is the father. From here on in, this is no longer you're typical comedy. Every scene with a funny line or situation is leveled with dialog that is serious and smart in nature. Watching this, it can be hard to understand why these people make some of the choices they do, but then you realize they are just like you.This is not as funny as The 40-Year Old Virgin, which itself was more straightforward in its crude and tasteless comedy. Here, Apatow shows his growth as a writer and director. He still has the ability to cast flawlessly with Heigel perfect as Allison, Paul Rudd sensational as Pete and his own wife, Leslie Mann, as Pete's wife Debbie. The real surprise, though, is Seth Rogen. He has such great timing, but his acting chops come alive here and he is given the ability to show that he is not just an actor for comedy but that he can take on any role and put his personal twist on it. I watched this in preparation for Apatow's third film, Funny People, and I only hope that it is as funny and sincere as his previous two films have been.",8,0,2,5 August 2009
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Burton's Gothic horror visual feast.
","Although this is a Stephen Sondheim musical, the film adaptation is truly a Tim Burton work of art. Sondheim provided wonderful material to work with and Burton took his twisted, perverse sense of style and bravado to create a lasting impression on the senses that is sure to be remembered for years to come.Even more impressive is the fact that the entire crew sings its own parts. This makes Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter's roles all the more astonishing, especially since neither of them had sung professionally prior to this. But natural talent they have and their on- screen chemistry is as good as need be; they are the perfect oddly admirable yet terribly creepy couple. Still, it is Burton who leaves the biggest impression on this film; his use of blood alone is worth your time. The sets are gorgeously bleak and dank, the costumes almost reek of decay and dirt, and the camera swoops to and fro as we witness a man completely consumed with revenge so as to blind him from everything the world still offers. Definitely not for the faint of heart, but people should realize this is pure fictional fantasy and great entertainment as well. The blood flows freely, almost aesthetically, symbolizing the release of Sweeney Todd's pent-up anger and disgust with humanity. Tim Burton's visual style was never more perfect for material than this; the result is nothing less than remarkable.",8,2,2,31 May 2011
The Town," The Restoration of Ben Affleck.
","More often than not, an actor in Hollywood will experience severe disability in terms of being able to choose scripts and quality movies. Ben Affleck has suffered from such a problem, taking the easy road during the middle period of his career in such clunkers as Armageddon, Pearl Harbor and Gigli. Yet, he has begun a turnaround with a solid role in Hollywoodland and his directing debut in the vastly underrated Gone Baby Gone. Now he's at it again, taking the same type of material he used in that 2007 film and focusing on the nature of bank robberies in a small suburb of Boston.In stretching his limits and going beyond his previous work, Affleck takes on the role of director, co-writer and lead actor here and does great work in all three. His acting has been criticized in the past for his lack of toughness and seemingly automatic ability to cry. Yet, here, he holds back much of the melodramatic emotion and lets his expressive face do more of the acting. For that reason alone, he gives perhaps his best performance. It also helps that he's working with great actors here; Jeremy Renner gives another memorable performance as a trigger-happy childhood friend of Affleck's willing to go to any length in a robbery to provide for his family. Jon Hamm is solid as the FBI agent right on the robbers' trail and Rebecca Hall deserves more buzz than she will get for this role as Claire, a bank manager taken hostage by Affleck's crew only to start a relationship with him.My main problem with this film was the casting of Blake Lively as Renner's younger sister, Krista, a single mother drug dealer and former lover of Affleck's. Lively, as beautiful as she is, gives a very melodramatic and seemingly amateurish performance; at times she is barely discernible. In truth, she is out of depth with nearly all these actors and comparing her to Hall just blows her out of the water. Still, the great Chris Cooper comes to save the day in just one powerful scene as Affleck's father. Perhaps the key scene, it explores family memories, regret and motivation all at the same time. It is scenes like this that prove Affleck's growing ability as a director.As for the film overall, it's very good but not great. I would hesitate to call it one of the best of 2010 only because we've seen this story before in better films like The Departed. Still, the quiet scenes are moving and poignant, the action sequences are startlingly violent and gripping and the final scene is one of great nostalgia and emotional depth. The most gratifying thing to come out of The Town is the fact that Ben Affleck is back in a big way. This film and Gone Baby Gone prove he's no longer that arrogant punk in Gigli or Pearl Harbor. Here, he's a man proved, tough and worthy. I certainly look forward to his next work as a director; his future is bright in all aspects.",8,3,7,24 September 2010
Taxi Driver," The long, lonely, seemingly never-ending road.
","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver emerges out of the mist and confusion of American movies during the past half century as a film not just about a lonesome soul searching for redemption, but also a deep and penetrating look at humanity as a whole, pondering our attempts to connect and establish relationships. It is at once both depressing and engrossing. Like its main character, Travis Bickle, it is a walking contradiction.Travis is one of the great characters of modern American cinema. He is a Vietnam vet, war-torn and psychologically strained, unable to sleep and obsessed with finding the right direction for his life as well as making a difference in the seedy streets of the town he calls home: New York City. Robert De Niro, one of the great modern American actors, gives a quiet, gentle, yet emotionally disturbed performance as he completely embodies every element of Travis. The various voice-overs provide more detail and information into his psychological profile, deepening our understanding and sympathy with him.Surrounding De Niro are other solid actors such as Harvey Keitel as the conniving pimp Sport, Albert Brooks as a nerdy campaign manager, Cybil Shepherd as the object of Travis' pure affections, and Jodie Foster as a 12 year-old prostitute who becomes the object of Travis' desire to take charge and initiate change. The whole cast is so good, it becomes ridiculous and redundant to praise or discuss them; they are these characters and must be accepted as such.The real collaboration for this film is that between director Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader, working here for the first but not last time. Schrader's screenplay is partially autobiographical, but also takes many plot points from John Ford's The Searchers, Dostoevsky and many other sources. What Scorsese is able to do in terms of realizing and visualizing these scenes is nothing short of mind-blowing. The opening shot is that of a yellow taxi, emerging like a great beast amidst the steam and fog that clouds the streets of New York like a mysterious forest. Scorsese then emphasizes the film's point of view by giving us extreme closeups of Bickles' eyes. All along, we see all that he does and eventually come to terms with how he sees the world. We sympathize because he's right and because we want him to come to grips with reality.Almost 35 years later, Taxi Driver remains a purely great American movie experience. The sets are impeccable, the camera-work perfect in how Scorsese allows it to glide across the streets, picking up every sordid detail Travis filters. Finally, the score must be given its due weight, which is nothing short of vital. The great Bernard Herrmann of Hitchcock fame ended his career with this minimalistic score compose entirely of brass with a saxophone solo so bittersweet and direct that it completely encompasses all the feelings of Travis and the atmosphere of the city. It is a great score, perfectly adept to what Herrmann attempted to do. This is always on great films lists, as well as included at the top of Scorsese and De Niro's best work. There's a reason for that: because it is.",Null,0,0,29 December 2010
Shutter Island," Is it possible Scorsese can make a bad movie?
","Shutter Island is a Martin Scorsese film no doubt about it. The atmosphere is very dark with raging storms outside and serious psychological problems on the inside. Teaming with Scorsese for the fourth time, Leonardo DiCaprio continues his ascent as one of the finest actors in Hollywood today. Taking place in 1954 on a remote island off the coast of Massachusetts, DiCaprio is Teddy Daniels, a US Marshal assigned to solve the mystery of a woman who supposedly disappeared from the seemingly impenetrable island.Without giving anything away, I must address the shock and somewhat disappointment this film has received from many critics and Scorsese fans alike. Some say the film loses its way at the halfway mark, some say the story doesn't work at all and its just filled with scenes of this great cast doing bad Bostonian accents. It certainly isn't one of Scorsese's best compared to the classics of Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas or The Departed but this taut thriller for the most part still delivers.The main problem people seem to have with Shutter Island is that the story goes way off keel in the last half hour and it does, that cannot be denied. However, the first 100 minutes are vintage Scorsese: dark, moody, and psychologically effective. DiCaprio is solid as a man tormented by demons that will eventually overtake his life. The supporting cast is very strong including Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, Emily Mortimer, Ted Levine and Michelle Williams, all who get their scene to shine and take advantage. The cinematography is very stunning and Scorsese's direction is effective in keeping us off balance so as to not know what to expect as the story unfolds.The main twist this whole story hinges upon is one that might be frustrating for some film lovers, especially those who have had more than enough of their share of twisted plots. Nevertheless, despite the overdose of twists and revelations in the final 15 minutes, it seems Scorsese is more concerned with the buildup to the final conclusion and it is quite a trip. The acting carries most of the story and DiCaprio and Williams make their scenes believable despite teetering on melodrama and overacting. This is the kind of film that depends on the mindset you take into it. If you have seen the trailer, you must not expect the best film Scorsese has ever done. But, keep an open mind and don't try to figure the plot as I did and you might just enjoy your time. It certainly isn't instantly forgettable and that is the true mark of a Martin Scorsese film.",8,1,4,27 February 2010
Barry Lyndon," A history lesson with Kubrick.
","No doubt for those of us that like to indulge in a little history lesson every now and then, it is hard to find a movie that so perfectly captures the realistic portrayal of people in earlier parts of the past millennium. Here, the great Stanley Kubrick has captured and frozen a part of time that will last forever. Taken from a European novel, the story is that of a young Irish rogue who takes it upon himself to rise up in the social class and make a life for himself. How he goes about this is quite unique and interesting, as well as the way Kubrick invites us the audience to partake in this journey.Nearly every scene is so perfectly lit, designed and dressed, it simply sweeps you up in the times of eighteenth century England. The dialog is outstanding, including the narration. The costumes and sets are immaculate and nearly steal away from the drama itself. Most of all, Kubrick has given us a look into the past and what it meant then to be someone and all the hard work it took to matter. Certainly not for everybody, with a running time of three hours and a very slow pace, Barry Lyndon will polarize some people. For Kubrick fans as well as history fans, however, it will amaze, dazzle and uplift as one of the very finest works of a great director and a great period in human history.",10,3,6,24 January 2009
Interstellar," Caretaker vs Pioneer
","Interstellar is a paradoxical achievement. It will undoubtedly inspire and influence future generations to further personal interests in science and astrophysics due mainly to its unsuccessful attempts to make theoretical physics part of the popular culture dialogue. Such an objective seems like a Herculean task, and the film succeeds to a certain degree, but there can be little doubt of its difficulty to find a solid fanbase, especially in non-scientific circles. Figures like Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein exist primarily as symbols of the highest accomplishments of human intelligence. This causes most people to understand their fields as out of the common perception and, thus, impossible to comprehend. Writer/director Christopher Nolan must be given credit for attempting to bring these highfalutin concepts to the mass population and doing so in a fashion so as to make it somewhat understandable and relatable. He does this by wrapping the highly complex material in a story filled with emotional connections, forcing audiences to pay closer attention than they would otherwise. This is made more apparent through the very effective acting of seemingly endless pedigree. Matthew McConaughey, continuing his laid-back acting style, makes this material much more relatable than most actors could. He never forces emotions, even during climactic moments, and thus brings us closer to his perspective and understanding. The opening sequences, which set the foundation of his relationship with his daughter, are so warm and touching that we are willing to follow him through any adventure. Supporting roles of Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine and Matt Damon work well enough, but it is obvious that Nolan's real connection to this story is the father/daughter relationship, which McConaughey, Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain embody so well. No longer can people claim Nolan is a cold, objective filmmaker with little to no regard for his characters and their feelings.What can continue to be a criticism of Nolan's film style is his inability to reconcile his erudite concepts and themes with dialogue and situations that are at the very least, digestible. Indeed, Nolan has made a career out of so-called 'mind-bending' movies like Memento and Inception which attempt to deliberately confuse the viewer until that moment of denouement when the reveal supposedly enlightens us to at least enough information to allow us to pretend to discuss the film intelligently. Certainly, like those aforementioned films, Interstellar will at the very least fertilize some discussion about high-mind concepts like black holes, event horizon, and tesseracts amongst those who would ordinarily never entertain such thoughts. In this respect, Nolan is trying to achieve the impossible, but he must be respected for attempting to bring these two seemingly unrelatable worlds together. No one else could or would try such a feat.Whether or not individuals will appreciate Nolan's vision for the future of humanity ultimately depends on one's point of view regarding our own purpose on Earth. The question posited is are humans caretakers for this planet or pioneers to search out others? Obviously we know Nolan's belief, but if one feels more inclined to be connected with earthly situations, it may be uncomfortable to get into the spirit of this story. Still, it only takes imagination to be astonished at the style in which Nolan has crafted this highly possible future reality.",Null,2,4,11 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Uncany and all too believable.
","For Stanley Kubrick, this material isn't necessarily new ground. He certainly covered the ideas and motivations behind war in Paths of Glory as well in parts of Dr. Strangelove and Barry Lyndon. Here, he took his most modern take on perhaps the most complex and enigmatic war the United States ever took part of. We follow closely a group of Marine trainees as they pass through many tests in order to become one of the Corps. For the first 45 minutes or so, the drama is unparalleled. On an island totally dominated by an unflinching and cruel drill instructor, these young boys quickly are forced to grow up and become the mindless and dehumanized killers the Marines require. It is here Kubrick seems to have much sympathy for all the privates as they gain knowledge, courage and strength but lose all sense of humanity.The second part follows Private Joker and Rafterman, a journalist and photographer on search for a story to up the morale of the US troops. Unfortunately, they discover that what they have trained for is to simply survive and this is the part where you might just be unable to peel your eyes from the action. If you have seen any war film before, you know how realistic and brutal the action scenes can be. Kubrick, perhaps the greatest atmospheric director ever, plunges us into the middle of an attack on Hue City as well as sneak attacks and other very real and very scary situations.I have to say this is a very unique war film in terms of American cinema. Being the most powerful country in the last half century, our position in any war usually affects the outcome. This is certainly the case in movies like Saving Private Ryan or Platoon. Full Metal Jacket, however, is much more personal than any other war film I have seen. These are sympathetic characters despite their attitude to life and the Vietnamese. Perhaps this is Kubrick's point. For the naysayers, I can understand why they would like the first half and not the second. True, they are polar opposites and at times the film feels like it is wandering aimlessly. But that is exactly what Kubrick wanted. Just like the soldiers themselves, we feel like their is no purpose in this foreign wasteland. Why are we here? Have we accomplished anything? Those are questions you can ask about the war today, which makes Full Metal Jacket all the more creepily prophetic.",9,0,0,2 February 2009
The Grapes of Wrath," Human beings wouldn't stand to live that way.
","Forget the politics behind the stories of Steinbeck or the politics of films of Ford. What truly lies at the center of this classic American film is not a socialistic message but rather a universal message; one that says that all people suffer in one way or another and it is the defiance and resistance that separates us from anyone else and our ability to choose not to take this lying down.The story is well-known: the Joad family is forced off their Oklahoma farm along with thousands of other Dust Bowl victims and decide to move to California in search of jobs and wages. Along the way they encounter kindness, hatred, peace and anger. There are times when the tribulations they face in California are more difficult than trying to survive in the Midwest, but push on they do led by the recently-paroled Tom, played quietly and most effectively by the great Henry Fonda. Jane Darwell won an Oscar for her role as the mother who also does her best to try and keep the fit together despite serious situations that could force them apart. Every other role is well-cast and adds a rich realistic tone to this movie that only makes you feel even more for these people who are just trying to get by each day, hoping for some sort of break or providence as a sign.I can see how this was such a politically-charged story but I don't think Ford intended that to be the priority of the film. Rather, I think it can all be summed up in the words of the two gas attendants early in the film. One says he thinks Okies have no feelings because no human would live like they do. Really, he was complimenting them as they believed the same way and this whole movie is about them attempting to rise above that which they were previously part of and become part of something better or at least more substantial. All this because they're the people.",9,3,5,12 August 2009
Empire of the Sun," Not real sure what this film is trying to say.
","Here I am, watching Empire of the Sun, expecting a decent film about a real time in world history since it is directed by Steven Spielberg and starring a young Christian Bale, one of my modern-day favorite actors. However, don't be fooled; this movie is total disappointment from start to finish. It starts with giving us some basic information about the events that shook up Shanghai in the 1940s, but then it descends into almost total nonsense that I am still trying to decipher. Don't get me wrong, Bale is pretty good here and Spielberg adds some nice shots of the landscape of China, but the script is absolute crap. There is no sense of direction or clairvoyance of where the story should go. It is more of showing us Jim go from one Japanese prison camp to another, meeting John Malkovich along the way, and running around trying to avoid being killed despite being right in the middle of warfare. Overall, Christian Bale disappoints but you can't really blame him since he was only thirteen and has done much better since. As for Spielberg, the 80s weren't real good to him except for the Indiana Jones trilogy and ET. This one is certainly not one his best work and it doesn't even feel like a Spielberg film. So, skip this and don't waste two and a half hours watching Christian Bale run all over China. There is nothing here to walk away with.",5,6,11,8 May 2008
American Sniper," American Pop Propaganda
","The War on Terror has been raging on since the seminal moment of this millennium; September 11, 2001, a day that has quite simply changed everything since. No part of our lives has been entirely unaffected, and the fact that this holds true for every American citizen may help to explain the reason for the film's astounding success in its first weekend; just about everyone seeing this film knows exactly the details and events surrounding the conflict which Chris Kyle became known as 'Legend,' which only enhances his stature in most peoples' eyes as a bonafide American hero who risked his life four separate times to fight intense combat in Iraq, often forced to stay behind and cover his fellow SEALs and Marines who were deployed to more dangerous work such as house-to-house searches in war zones for information about al- Qaeda leaders. It is his story that has come to represent the accomplishment, at whatever price, of the early phase of this newfound type of conflict. Whether or not it has been worth the risk remains hotly contested.It should be noted that it is almost impossible to review any film which covers any aspect of the War on Terror without comparing it to Zero Dark Thirty, Katherine Bigelow's masterful account of the ultimate mission for the United States in the Middle East: to hunt down and kill Osama bin-Laden. Chris Kyle himself has said in interviews that he wishes he had been assigned to SEAL Team 6, the team responsible for although he certainly did his share on Team 3 in killing various Iraqi insurgents. Nevertheless, on a filmic level, Clint Eastwood's steady, conventional and even-keeled style seems to underwhelm this material. Here we have the story of a man where the tagline is 'the deadliest sniper in US military history,' yet the bulk of the story seems to take this description for granted. In contrast to Zero Dark Thirty, the screenplay doesn't get into the specifics or details surrounding the complicated aspects of fighting terrorism on the enemies' home turf and the impact that has on American foreign policy as a whole. Indeed, much of the larger geopolitical themes are muted here in order to focus on the rather repetitive structure of showing Kyle's extraordinary ability to kill from astonishing lengths. Of course, this is a much more focused type of story, but the character of Chris Kyle seems to be an archetype symbolizing American forces instead of a fully-realized individual. He exhibits typical behavior of any deployed soldier regarding guilt about dead soldiers as well as the conflict between needing to remain loyal to his family and his country. These are well-treaded conventions of recent war films, not the least of which is Bigelow's other intensified journey into the mind of the modern solider, The Hurt Locker. Kyle is very similar to Jeremy Renner's devoted and effective soldier who finds himself addicted to any form of combat as a drug, although the true story element does add a different understanding of the effects.This is not to say that the film is made without a certain amount of professionalism and understanding. Bradley Cooper is very effective as Kyle, bulking up without looking too muscular or movie-hunkish. His acting focuses on the details of portraying a patriotic Texan, complete with the slow drawl, affection for beer and rodeo, as well as complete devotion to his wide-mouthed wife and growing family. Cooper's full range as an actor is on display here, complete with the dead-eye stare of a man who has seen horrors impossible to describe and feels an uncontrollable need to try and bring equilibrium to his life. Sienna Miller seems to have relegated herself recently to playing wives of real-life characters, having done so in Foxcatcher and here. She brings a glamorous quality to Taya, portraying her as a loving wife who puts the need for family stability above her husband's inner desire for combat and revenge.It is this revenge element which many critics have leeched upon as evidence of Kyle's racist and jingoist attitude towards Iraqis and other Islamists. Although Eastwood does take a pretty apparent right-leaning view of the conflict, he nevertheless attempts to extricate any sort of moral judgment on Chris Kyle and his importance to the American hero mythology. The point of this story, to whatever effect it may have, is that one man saw himself not necessarily as the savior of freedom and democracy, but simply a soldier who followed the orders to protect fellow soldiers from behind, perched above with a high-powered rifle and an eagle eye. The impact this will have on the upcoming trial for Kyle's alleged murderer will undoubtedly be felt throughout the media. It will be interesting to note the recruiting effect of this movie as well. It's easy to imagine a lot of young men getting hyped for fighting through these images.",Null,10,31,21 January 2015
American Hustle," The Great Con Divide
","With a star-studded cast, lavish cinematography which so effectively evokes the 1970's bewildering chic style, and a plot line intended to rekindle memories of other hustling movies from this era such as The Sting, American Hustle has all the glitz and glamor necessary to become both a popular and critical acclaim. The co-writer and director, David O. Russell, has emerged in recent years as a force to be reckoned with. His most eclectic collection of works includes delving into the world of existential detectives fighting nihilism, a truth-based story of an underdog boxer fighting for his and his troubled brother's reputation, and a romantic tale of two mentally unstable people falling in love. Clearly, Russell has a wild imagination and he puts it on full display in his most ambitious and commercial project to date. Loosely based (as it so willingly tells us up front) on the ABSCAM scandal of the 1970s, Russell treats the case like a true filmmaker: he takes what he wants, abandons what he does not, and shakes it all up to create a perfect concoction of Hollywood craftsmanship and subtle plot manipulation.This is not to say that these traits are condemnations. Indeed, in the world in which Russell attempts to let this movie live, these are necessary hallmarks, as Christian Bale so smoothly tells us, 'Everyone hustles to survive.' Russell must have smiled with delight in writing that line since it so precisely reveals the justification needed both by the con artist characters in the film and the filmmakers in which they reside. Obviously, he prefers a character study to a straight-up Ocean's Eleven type double-crossing plot structure. Such an ensemble cast has swallowed his bait. Nearly everyone loves playing dress-up here, not just with clothes but also hair, jewelry and accents. It's an actor's dream come true. Bale goes method, as he so often does, gaining a gut and giving himself a noticeably bad, fake comb-over, which Russell fonds over for several minutes in the film's opening. Bradley Cooper wears mini-curlers to make his straight hair curly, lives with his androgynous mother and a woman who says she is his fiancé, and seemingly lives passionately for his job as an FBI agent determined to crack down on corrupt bureaucrats, politicians and ultimately, the Mafia. Jeremy Renner must have needed several bottles of hairspray, but mostly plays it straight as a mayor with a heart of gold, evident from his large, multi-cultural family, who wants only to protect his community from financial crisis. While the men fuss over their looks so profusely, the women in this film almost certainly went overboard as well, though for them the effect must have been even more profound. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence raid the Elizabeth Taylor closet and layer themselves with furs, backless and strapless dresses of the gaudiest colors, as well as hairstyles that would make any 18th century French woman jealous. If it seems that there has been too much emphasis on the look of this movie, it must be stressed that the movie stresses these elements on its own volition. It grows almost to the point of overpowering the story and characterization. Most audiences will claim to not have a problem with it, but for those trying to see what lies behind the material elements will prove difficult.While Russell freely admits to not basing his entire story on true events, the fact that he even inserted the title card 'Some of this happened' at the beginning shows his desire to remind us that the acts and personalities of these characters are rooted in reality. Why is this necessary information to digest before the film begins? The intended effect on the audience, presumably, is to trick us into believing more of the outlandish results and developments as we continue to watch. No matter what we see, we are still reminded some variation of these events did happen at one point to people faintly like the ones we are watching on the screen. At this point, is it even worth mentioning? Why not simply take a story like this and use it as a launching pad for a completely new and different take on the con game sub-genre? Even if this was Russell's original intent, it still renders the use of that title card almost entirely useless.Perhaps the greatest fault one can find with this film is that it is too self-conscious. Having focused so much effort on the look of the film, one gets wrapped up in a story that is all surface with little substance. Yet, on one level, this may be a clever ruse by Russell. After all, the entire story is about various people conning one another for various reasons, as well as themselves into acting in ways they wouldn't ordinarily consider. Though this would seem to rustle up some emotional conflict, Russell practically telegraphs his intentions through dialogue and the actors' faces, thus deflating any intent of luring us in for the whole movie. All the actors are clearly enjoying themselves, especially Lawrence who plays her role as a sassy, fiercely unstable woman determined to hold on to whatever remains of her shattered life. It is a brave performance, although in the end she remains mostly obsolete to the story. By contrast, Adams is thoroughly stunning in all her outfits as well as a great counterpart to the introvert and conflicted Bale. Indeed, all the actors chew the scenery as though it were delicious beef jerky. The result is a mostly interesting, though altogether somewhat unfulfilled experience which is a letdown considering the buildup this film gives itself. In a way, this is just another con by Russell, but the audience may not be as receptive as the FBI.",Null,0,2,7 January 2014
The Godfather: Part II," Travesty abounds.
","The Godfather: Part II is not a sequel in the traditional Hollywood sense, rather a companion piece to one of the greatest films ever made in The Godfather. Here, the story is epic and sprawling, as it covers Michael's reign as the new head of the Corleone family by moving the business to Nevada and at the same time flashes back to show the story of how a young Vito Corleone came to power and started the story now being continued.Francis Ford Coppola returns to his old ground with writing partner Mario Puzo to expand on Michael and establish Vito and doing so by going back and forth. This leads to some incredible shots of the young Vito and the young Michael in the same frame, a haunting image and symbol of how far this family has come. It also shows how far Coppola has come in terms of directing these films. Once again, his direction is immaculate in every sense, perfectly balancing the time between Michael and Vito, always picking the right time to go from story to story.All this aside, I haven't even mentioned the other strong points, which are basically all of them. The flawless acting continues here with Al Pacino cementing his legacy in this very subdued yet emotionally upsetting performance as Michael, the youngest who seemed ostracized from his family at the beginning and now has all the power and success and none of the love or affection his father had. Indeed, one of the main themes of the film is to show how different Michael handles things from his father and whether or not he is a better leader. Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire and the tragic John Cazale all contribute so much in their roles, and Robert De Niro made his name known with a flawless performance as the young, ambitious and loyal Vito.Once again, Gordon Willis photographs and once again the darkness shrouds the characters, symbolizing the heavy-handed situations surrounding them. This adds so much to the tone and atmosphere of the story that it completely takes us up in the story and makes the 200 minute running time fly by smoothly. The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II have long been recognized as required viewing for any film lover and I cannot argue. They are so well-made and engrossing that it is impossible to not feel for these characters and the choices they make.The final two scenes are quite something to behold. The first is a flashback to see the kids waiting for Vito to surprise him on his birthday. Here, we see how Michael truly was treated and how Sonny, Tom, and Connie related to one another and how it colored the rest of their existence. The final scene is Michael, alone and contemplating everything that has happened. It is a scene for the audience to contemplate and wonder at the travesty that has abounded. And these two films are truly something to behold and admire for their sheer quality and intensity.",9,4,7,19 November 2009
Fargo," A lot can happen in the middle of nowhere.
","The Coen Brother's masterpiece of the 1990s is Fargo, an incredibly twisted, sick, yet funny and quirky story about a kidnapping plot gone wrong. William H. Macy is spectacular as the befuddled yet conniving car salesman Jerry Lundegarrd, a man trying to make his way in the world but decides to do so by having two not-so-smart henchmen kidnap her. From here, everything that can go wrong does and we see all that Jerry thought was going to work turns out to come and bit him in the butt.What really is memorable about this film is not only the great performances by Macy, Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare but also the amazing settings the Coens gave themselves to set each scene up to be exactly as they wanted it. Collaborating with the genius that is Roger Deakins, they give us a bleak and ugly landscape that sets the tone for the rest of the story. This is certainly the type of movie perfectly watchable in the dead of winter, especially if you live in an area where snow is constantly looming above. The writing is nothing short of incredible as it moves flawlessly from each characters' situation until it all comes together in the end. Certainly one of the best films of the 1990s, if you are at all interested in the Coen Brothers, this film represents them best.",9,0,0,10 August 2008
Nightcrawler," A lifetime too late.
","Jake Gyllenhaal, perhaps known most for his role as Donnie Darko, the troubled teen with futuristic visions of destiny, may never truly escape that pigeon-hole. As Louis Bloom, he siphons similar traits of Donnie to bring us a character with the same intensity and psychological uneasiness. The main difference is that Donnie becomes a symbol of sympathetic teen angst amidst a growing world of discontentment and detachment. Louis' motive is purely out of survival, a man driven to succeed at any cost by his instinctive desire for rising above the average and middling. It has been reported that Gyllenhaal lost 20 lbs and did extensive daily workouts to perfect the gaunt, eerie gaze he utilizes, drawing our eyes to his as we watch him survey his surroundings and react. This is an opportunist who seemingly has no conscience as to his actions, which is obviously the message of the movie; a message that is, regrettably, nothing new to this most cynical and knowledgeable of ages.Writer/director Dan Gilroy seems to have attempted to stay loyal to the family modus operandi, that is to build quickly and quietly to an effective climax intended to challenge preconceived notions and foster thorough questioning of our understanding. His brother, Tony, did this to great effect in Michael Clayton, a similar story about a man driven to fight for survival, only in this case it was out a sense of moral righteousness. Louis' determination to succeed seems to stem from a desire to cement himself not only as a winner and accomplished businessman but also for fame and recognition from the larger community. This makes it rather apparent why Gilroy set the story in Los Angeles; not only for its endless supply of criminal activity but also its cult of narcissism and self-promotion. Alas, Gilroy never seems to drive to the heart of this matter, or at least drive into an area which we haven't already been exposed. There is a great deal of time devoted to Louis' interaction with the ruthless and desperate TV producer (Rene Russo) who lives by the ratings, which means she wants more graphic violence and less journalistic emphasis. She is, however, a pale imitation of Faye Dunaway's great performance in Network, who was far more ambitious and had more of an impact on the men in her life than Russo does. Additionally weak is the handling of violent crimes and accident scenes. Sequence after sequence point out how newscasters and news outlets want the story which sells above all else, which in this case consists of more violent and upsetting information. Even for a huge metropolis like LA, the amount of serious crimes within this narrative is very unsettling (although Louis uses the falling crime rate as a bargaining chip for his increasingly intense coverage of these scenarios). Yet, Gilroy sweeps all this aside in order to emphasize his righteous message. Instead, we get a gratuitously extended violent sequence that stretches plausibility and simply confirms our beliefs about these characters instead of evolving them. There is a great deal of dark comedy attempted in this story. Indeed, the audience seems to laugh right along with Gyllenhaal's bizarre and creepy intensity which also happens to be border-line parodist acting. Yet, how much does Gilroy intend to be comedic and how much is intended to be dogmatic? Whichever the case, the end result remains the same. How terrible it is that television news praises ratings and showmanship over honest and straightforward reporting? David Simon gave us this same message in a much more effective manner in The Wire (ironically, the weakest of all five seasons). Couldn't Gilroy, with the expansive potential of cinema, have at least delved into slightly darker, more provocative territory? As it stands, Nightcrawler remains a less-than-powerful expose on a subject with much more potentiality in this digital era, an angle Gilroy mysteriously neglects.",Null,1,4,4 November 2014
The Aviator," A Herculean achievement.
","Martin Scorsese, long considered the greatest living American director, certainly solidified this status with three gargantuan, monstrous and epic films during the 2000s, portraying three very different time periods in American culture, all while exhibiting his fluid camera style, crisp editing and boundless creative storytelling. Perhaps of the three films, The Aviator might be the most ambitious, extravagant and compelling if only because it tells the story of a real American attempting to pursue that infamous American dream and does so in a massive way, only to lose it in the process through no fault of his own.Howard Hughes, the most ambitious and impulsive businessman of the 20th century, is a fascinating character not just for his successes but also his failures. Very few, if any, could match his insatiable thirst for success and prestige. Scorsese captures this in nearly every scene, building up for the first 2 hours an enormous tale of lust, greed and ambition that is nothing short of astonishing to watch. This is due in equal parts to Scorsese's magnificent direction and Leonardo DiCaprio's brilliant rendition of Hughes the man.Scorsese guides the story through nearly every major facet of Hughe's life beginning in 1927 when he is a young kid from Texas using his parents' money to make a Hollywood film, Hell's Angels. His obsessive perfection leads to the film costing nearly $4 million and three years of production. He goes on to make films such as Scarface and The Outlaw, both of which courted much controversy for their content. However, his true love was aviation, which he poured millions of dollars into to stay at the top of the game. His creations were astounding and Scorsese's recreations of such crafts as the X-11 and the Spruce Goose are nothing short of incredible.For his personal life, Hughes hit the Hollywood jackpot by dating one star after another. Scorsese focuses on the two most important: Katherine Hepburn, his one true love, and Ava Gardner, who saw him more as a soul in need of salvation than a lover. Cate Blanchett won an Oscar for her role as Hepburn and it is something to behold; the magnificent way she embodies Hepburn's insatiable New England smugness and conceit. However, DiCaprio's status as one of the very best actors working today needs only this film to justify that statement. He is in practically every scene and owns all of them. His facial expressions, stage presence and overall body language is so perfectly sublime, subdued and structured that he does become Hughes. All Leo haters must look at his work here as something that demands great respect.Along with Gangs of New York and The Departed, Martin Scorsese and Leonard DiCaprio created three magnificently entertaining films dealing with similar protagonists: a man tortured by his past and struggling to forge ahead in the future. This is not so unlike other Scorsese characters like Travis Bickle, Jake LaMotta or Rupert Pupkin. There is also a bit of Scorsese in Hughes' professional life. Both are obsessed with detail, focused solely on the task at hand and very successful because of this. A great tribute to a great man from a great director.",Null,0,0,21 January 2011
Burn After Reading," Wild, crazy, bizarre, unpredictable; it must be the Coen brothers.
","This is one strange movie. I cannot remember the last time I walked out from viewing a movie and thinking to myself, 'what the heck did I just see?' I'm not sure this is such a bad thing. The first time I saw it, I was completely dumbfounded and flabbergasted. I couldn't believe this movie was written, produced, and directed by those genius brothers that made last year's masterpiece that was No Country For Old Men. However, since it is the Coen Brothers, I decided to give it a second chance and I am glad to say many things were cleared up, but not all.First of all, you have to look at this movie from the Coen's point of view. Here they are, coming off winning three Oscars for making No Country For Old Men. If history is any indication, they are next in line for a much more light-hearted story than the last one they did. This offer is certainly the most bizarre of any Coen movie I have ever seen, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing. The acting is terrific all the way around with an all-star cast worthy of watching. George Clooney is funny as a womanizing CIA goof, John Malkovich is also very good as an alcoholic, foul-mouthed former agent, Frances McDormand is beautiful to watch as a woman who thinks she is going down the tube, and Brad Pitt gives perhaps the best performance as a complete numbskull of a gym trainer trying his very hardest to help out his friend Linda (McDormand). Other supporting characters, such as the lovable Richard Jenkins and the cold-hearted Tilda Swinton also score.I have come to the conclusion that this movie is really only for those who are a fan of the Coen's previous indie-type comedies. No Country wasn't mainstream, but it certainly had Oscar written all over it when it was released. This movie reminds me of back in the late 90's when the Coens made Fargo, won an Oscar for it, then released The Big Lebowski two years later. They weren't going for gold, just trying to get some laughs. And they did, creating a movie that is considered a cult classic some ten years later. If you appreciate the Coen's special brand of dark humor and wild storytelling, give Burn After Reading a chance. If not, don't bother; it's not your cup of tea.",8,2,7,22 September 2008
Watchmen," For what it's worth, it's astonishing.
","Prior to going to see this film last night, I was overlooking some critic reviews ans was rather surprised to hear their response. A good bit of them were panning the film calling it superfluous and plodding. Going into this picture, I knew I had to take some of these elements very lightly as this is based on a graphic novel with not a real sense of reality along with the 160 minute running time. Still, based solely as a piece of film making, which is how I viewed it without comparing it to its original material at all, I found it to be visually stunning as well as occupying a heart, something usually lacking in superhero flicks.To surmise the plot, the year is 1985 in an alternate universe where Richard Nixon is president for a fifth term, the US and Russia are on the brink of nuclear destruction, and superheroes are a part of everyday life and culture. Here, they have been around since the 1940s and continue to evolve and fit into the society that changes constantly. Now, one of their own as been viciously murdered and the most mysterious of the Watchmen, Rorschach is on his own manhunt to find the killer. He comes across his old pals including Nite Owl II, Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan. Together again, they now must fight the world that will end without them, their own personal demons and each other amidst a nearing apocalypse.Again, going only on the film aspects, this does triumph in more ways than I think people are giving it credit for. Despite the running time, director Zack Snyder gives adequate insight to each superhero showing their past in flashback as well as what has led them to this point. This is wondrous to behold as we get to see a variety of people who have been called upon to save the world when they need saving from themselves or the situation they find themselves in. The acting is mostly great with Jackie Earl Hayley as Rorschach, the narrator, perfectly capturing his brutal manner and grisly voice. Patrick Wilson is also terrific as an overweight, mild-mannered geek Dan Dreiberg who once masqueraded as a superhero but now is reduced to working in his basement. Malin Akerman, I can't really say is that convincing as an actress but she does look good in tights. Perhaps the most sympathetic character is Jon Otterman, also known as Dr. Manhattan, a glowing blue superman who is almost like a demi-god in the fact that he isn't limited by time and space. Because of this, caused by and accident in the lab, he is also in his own world and unable to connect to really anyone outside of himself.I know why some people would really not like this film as the tone is incredibly grim and the plot is sometimes convoluted. Still, there is not doubt in the visual effects, which are ground-breaking and beautiful at the same time. As I said before, the acting is mostly great with some characters not cast for talent as much as for looks. Director Snyder handles this material, which I am told is unfilmable, with a deft hand and is mostly successful, save for a completely unnecessary sex scene in the middle set to the song 'Hallelujah.' Of course, no one else will complain about that, but despite that and several plot holes, Watchmen is astonishing and although it's much too early, is probably the best film of 2009. Enjoy it for what it is and understand the movies are headed in this direction. Change is coming to all of us, no matter what we do.",8,2,5,7 March 2009
The Color of Money," Newman shines, Cruise dazzles, Scorsese disappoints slightly.
","I understand why Martin Scorsese directed The Color of Money. I just wish this small-time genre picture had been made at a little higher quality. After an attempt to film The Last Temptation of Christ in 1983 failed, Scorsese turned to smaller pictures made at lower budgets in order to get clout with studios. In 1985, he released After Hours, a strange, weirdly entertaining film of one man's wild and crazy night in Soho, New York. The Color of Money couldn't be more different in tone or style, yet it isn't able to conjure up the same energy or driving force After Hours did.What does work in The Color of Money is the acting. Paul Newman, a legend of the silver screen, reprises his role as 'Fast Eddie' Felson who is now 25 years older and comes across a young pool player that revives the competitive spirit in him. The player is Vincent, an extremely cocky and self-aware young man with a gorgeous yet somewhat detached girlfriend, Carmen. Tom Cruise is perfectly cast as Vincent, able to capture every amount of arrogance and superiority a young, successful player would have. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is wonderful as well; beautiful, mysterious and with a subtle underside to her character that gives her more of an edge than the main characters.This, in turn, becomes one of the main problems of the film. What the screenplay lacks is an intriguing setup between Newman and Cruise. Here we have two bonafide stars of the screen, yet it becomes rather obvious what is going to happen in nearly every single scene between them. The generation gap as well as the differing personalities creates such a predictable conflict that the film loses much of its suspense and edge. Another problem is the flashy photography and editing tricks Scorsese utilizes in the pool scenes. More often than not, it probably would have been more effective to simply shoot it straight instead of trying to dress it up with so many effects and techniques. I understand why Scorsese did it this way, to draw in the large audiences to maintain his status. In the end, however, the final result doesn't add up to much of a great entertainment. With all this talent on display, it leaves something to be desired.",Null,2,3,9 January 2011
North by Northwest," War is hell, even if it is a cold one.
","Although it is one of his most famous it may not be considered among his best, which I think it deserves to be. North by Northwest is more than a cross-country trip across America to solve a case of mistaken identity, it is also a send-up of all the old detective and spy movies Hollywood made in the 1930s and 1940s. What Hitchcock has done here is take a similar premise from one of his earlier films, Saboteur, and create a funny, intelligent and wonderfully entertaining story filled with great visuals and one-liners.Cary Grant gives perhaps his best role for Hitchcock in his last as Roger Thornhill, a man caught up in the web of espionage and deceit as he tries to convince a group of men that he is not George Kaplan. Eva Marie Saint is quite a saint as the beautiful and tough Eve Kendall. Perhaps the true reason to this great success is due to Ernest Lehman's fully entertaining script that has many tart one-liners as well as enough twists to screw up even M. Night Shyamalan. Of course, Hitchcock was at the top of his game here, working between his two greatest pictures, Vertigo and Psycho. Here, he is just having fun, playing with us as we try to follow all the action and suspense. Truly, this could be considered a prelude to all those other action movies made today. Some are good, most are pathetic, but Hitchcock pointed the way and it is a path worth going down again and again.",10,1,3,30 May 2009
Doctor Zhivago," A classic, timeless story and the last great epic film.
","Taken from the classic Russian novel by Boris Pasternak, Doctor Zhivago remains and always will be a timeless piece of reading that can never truly be measured in regular terms. The power and emotion behind the character's motivations and actions really speak for themselves and show how incredibly moving the story is. In 1965, David Lean brought the story to life and with great results. Omar Sharif played the title character, Julie Christie his lover Lara, and Geraldine Chaplin his wife Tonya.Essentially, perhaps the biggest problem with the film is the fact that the novel is much more political than the movie. Lean told writer Robert Bolt to downplay the politics when adapting it, and that is a good and bad thing. It works in bringing the love story to life better than nearly any other romantic movie, yet nearly all other parts fall far short of this dynamic. Sharif also seems a bit miscast at times, though it's hard today to imagine anyone else as Zhivago. Chapin, the daughter of Charlie Chaplin himself, is in my mind miscast completely. Perhaps it is the fact her character is pretty bland compared to the passion between Zhivago and Lara, but I really didn't care much for her at all. I read somewhere that Audrey Hepburn was considered for the part. That would have been a great improvement.Despite all that is considered wrong with the film, it really is a triumph; so much in fact that it is considered to be the last great epic Hollywood ever made. It's hard to think of a movie that comes close to the magnitude and power it brought to the screen. From the man who gave us The Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia, two of the greatest epics ever made, it was hard-pressed to top those. Still, this story will last forever, thus the film will last forever. Most memorable are the gorgeous cinematography from Freddie Young, Maurice Jarre's haunting score, and the wild and sheer beauty of Julie Christie as Lara. These three elements alone make it worth seeing, and worth considering as one of the finest films of its time.",8,2,4,17 November 2008
American Beauty," One of the 10 best films I have ever seen.
","This is a masterpiece, perfect in every way. It has completely changed the way I view films and the way I look at life. The acting is excellent, especially with Spacey and Bening. The directing by Mendes is one of the best I have ever seen in a film. The cinematography is so beautiful with the strong contrast between the red and other colors. Aside from being visually beautiful, the story itself is this film's best feature. It is original, with hints of humor, noir, drama, and sadness. Overall, it is thought-provoking in a way very few films are. It is hard to watch what these characters are doing because we know that they are only leading themselves to their own demise. Ball's screenplay is one that should be required reading in film schools and the final sequence is perhaps the most beautiful thing ever filmed. It is a stunning achievement, deserving of every award it got. It is, in my opinion, one of the 10 best films I have ever seen and the best film of the 1990s after Schindler's List. It is so real, so poignant, so heartbreaking. Powerful and serene, this is why I love movies. They can change your thinking.",10,1,2,31 January 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The standard of action films of all genres.
","No matter how many action movies have been made since 1991, Terminator 2 stands heads above all others; really every other movie is just trying to mimic the standards T2 created. Although the first was quite astonishing in that it was made for a mere $6.5 million yet looks more engaging and explosive than most big budget action flicks today, the sequel stands as one of the three or four films that actually surpass the original in every aspect. The story continues the Terminator mythology established previously, but also expands on it, giving more background details as well as dropping hints of what the future holds for the Connors and humankind. What is also surprising about this film is how well the acting holds up. Usually characters and plot are secondary to the action sequences, but writer/director James Cameron weaves them together and the result is a very pleasing and satisfying experience that truly wraps you up completely in the story from beginning to end. By now, it is a well-known fact that Cameron is a master of visual effects and has done more than anyone, sans George Lucas, to make them progressive enough to be the foundation of blockbuster movies they are today. In seeing this and the original Terminator films, we see a more primitive style from Cameron. He must rely more on editing than he does now in order to hide some of the small details not able to be changed with computers or special effects. This gives a more intimate and personal experience to the viewer but cannot take away from the sheer brilliance of the effects used on the character of the T-1000. In seeing the special edition as I have, I must confess I have not seen the original cut so obviously I have seen more than was initially planned. Yet, I am sure that I have not seen too little of the incredible and painstaking ability and work put forth by Industrial Light and Magic in order to create a character made out of liquid metal, who can change shape into almost any physical specimen, walk through solid metal, and even coagulate after being frozen and blasted apart. Seeing this was almost groundbreaking for me, even though it was released some 20 years ago. The computer and digital effects look better than much of what is accomplished today, perhaps mostly because it adds to the story rather than diverting our attention away from it. On top of all that, this is simply a very well-made film that puts most other action pictures to shame. In looking at Cameron's filmography, his two bench-mark films are probably Aliens and Terminator 2 as with each of these he raised the bar of what can be acceptable as solid action and essentially paved the way for his less action but just as impressive films of Titanic and Avatar, which now reign supreme as the two highest grossing films of all time. I cannot express enough how enjoyable all of Cameron's films that I have seen are. He will probably never be compared to the likes of Welles, Kurosawa or Kubrick, but perhaps he deserves his own category as special effects and digital wonder pioneer. In that regard, he truly is the king of the world.",9,2,2,20 May 2010
Duck Soup," The best during the Paramount years.
","Duck Soup is the climax of of everything the Marx Brothers tried to do while in their early years of performing. With a fine director (Leo McCarey) and more polished writing, the 4 brothers were able to finally make a movie most worthy of their talents and blend in some political satire along the way. Groucho plays Rufus T. Firefly, who somehow becomes the head of the tiny nation Freedonia. Zeppo continues to play it straight in his last role with his brothers as Bob Roland, the secretary, and Chico and Harpo play spies trying to overthrow Firefly.This is certainly the best of early Marx Brothers and one of their best works ever. Groucho dominates the screen with all his one-liners and Chico and Harpo providing nice supporting comic relief. This is a movie for anybody, not just fans of the Marx Brothers' lesser work. It appeals to all that can laugh. Anybody can find this humor funny, which is what makes it so good. It is timeless and lasts forever. Long live the Marx Brothers.",8,0,0,30 July 2008
Apocalypse Now," Far out of reach for any filmmaker today.
","There are quite a few good movies out in circulation today, many of which have been released in the past five years. None, however, can claim the title of most ambitious film of all time. For that title must go to Apocalypse Now, the classic yet surreal tale of US forces in Vietnam experiencing more than their share of problems and violence amongst the jungles and wilderness.What does one say about a film like this? It certainly isn't easy to criticize, mostly because you don't really watch it so much as experience it. Every scene builds tension and emotion as you watch these young American boys, innocent when arriving, be turned into robotic killers with an almost complete lack of remorse or emotion. Coppola is able to keep our attention and at the same time somehow get us to sympathize but also be stunned at the severity of the action taking place. Each scene is so layered, so complex with what it is trying to evoke that it makes the viewing experience a mind-blowing journey very much like Willard's journey to Kurtz.The success of this film is in no small thanks to the acting, with the classic lineup delivering on the nose the exact tone of monotonous and deplored sense of bewilderment. Of course, it is Marlon Brando who is the show-stopper as Kurtz, the crazed colonel running his own version of the war in the heart of the jungle. As we follow Willard (Martin Sheen) to find Kurtz, we realize perhaps he is not as crazy as first portrayed. After witnessing Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall in perhaps his best work ever) and the insane chaos that is the Do Nung Bridge, could it be possible that Kurtz isn't as bad as they say? This, of course, is part of the journey and something the audience itself needs to figure out.All the same, Apocalypse Now is one of the greatest of all films because it goes farther than any of its kind. The helicopter scene when Kilgore's cavalry attack a Vietnamese village is perhaps the most daring and ambitious sequence ever filmed. No film maker or even studio would dare do such a thing, probably instead using CGI to create the effects. But Coppola was a genius and just crazy enough to be able to try such a stunt. Indeed, the whole movie is a crazy stunt and one that you won't soon forget.",10,4,5,22 November 2009
Jarhead," A solid war piece.
","Compared to Sam Mendes' other works, this one lacks the really powerful acting and original storyline of American Beauty or Road to Perdition. Compared to other war films, however, it is still a strong piece that shows the obscurity and tediousness the Marines went through in the Gulf War. The cinematography is very good, with the scenes of burning oil being beautiful to look at. Overall, I thought this film was very neutral in its message. It isn't pro-war or anti-war. It simply shows what Anthony Swofford and other Marines went through and what they continue to go through after returning home. If anything, watching this film should increase our respect for anyone who fights in the military. It is a rough life, and all that sign up for it deserve to be respected by those who do not.",7,1,1,31 January 2008
Collateral," A first-rate thriller all the way.
","This film has opened up new paths for many. The two biggest paths opened up are those for lead actors Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, who both give outstanding performances and should get similar roles in the future. AS for the film itself, this is suspense at its finest art form. It opens up simple, with very little action and lots of close-ups to get familiar with the surroundings. Then, the characters meet. Vincent (Cruise), is a killer hired to make five stops in one night, so he hires Max (Foxx), a cab driver to chauffeur him around Los Angeles until 6 am. You would think that nothing too outrageous will happen, but eventually Max finds out Vincent's line of work and the police are on their trail as well.This is a terrific film, filled with exceptional performances, excellent writing, and marvelous directing by Michael Mann that holds us in suspense just long enough to finish the story, but not too long that we begin to not care. All elements come together to make this a first-rate thriller in every way. The ending is satisfying and the scenes leading up to it are heart-pounding. See this film if only for the mesmerizing performance by Tom Cruise. Cold, ruthless, and completely lost in his work, this performance is one of the very best in modern movies. For that matter, this whole film is one of the best of the decade.",9,3,4,4 June 2008
Ratatouille," Amazing, spectacular, and perfect.
","The greatest test of whether or not a film is truly admirable is how well it holds up years after its release. It has been almost three years since Ratatouille has been released and I have now seen it at least four times, maybe more. I am proud and thrilled to say that it has not lost any of its charm, still looks amazing and holds up better than almost any film I've seen as many times as I've seen this.It's hard to put your finger on, but why exactly is Pixar able to create these astonishingly good films that aren't just entertaining and delightful, although they certainly are that. They are able to tap into the very realms of the human condition, and with this bring to the surface emotions and feelings you come to not expect from an animated film because after all, animated automatically infers a film for children.Of course Ratatouille breaks that mold and I am just so pleased that I got caught up in the world of Remy once again. With their endless budget from Disney, Pixar can create and explore any aspect necessary and writer/director Brad Bird does just that. The story here comprises elements of drama, sadness, family relations, job pressures, as well as a wonderful monologue near the end by a critic for critics. The story is pitch-perfect, always understandable and the foundation for which the film is made.And, since it is Pixar and Disney, the look and feel of the film is so engrossing, it looks better than other animated films made after it. One of the things Pixar does so well is find the middle ground in making elements of the frame look real but not too real, thus still maintaining an animated universe. They did it with the water in Finding Nemo, the cars in Cars, and they do it here with the food, which at times looks so real you want to taste it.I really can't say anything bad about Ratatouille. Even the story elements of how Remy and his human counterpart, Linguini, are able to work together work because this is the animated world which lends itself to more freedoms than our world. The voices are terrific from Patton Oswalt to Ian Holm to the great Peter O'Toole as deathly-thin food critic Anton Ego. There really isn't anything here that doesn't work and Michael Giacchino's score emits the spirit of Paris that sets the background for this story. This is just a great film, perfect in its story, its characters and the wonderful, vibrant world it creates. Years after its release, Ratatouille continues and will continue to impress and immerse viewers in a touching story with beautiful surroundings about the cutest rat in the world becoming a chef in Paris. Only animation, and only Pixar, could make this a film and succeed.",10,8,10,22 January 2008
Aliens," Cameron shows tremendous stride early on.
","It is quite hard to believe this is just the third full-length feature film James Cameron ever made after the first Terminator and his ultra- low budget Piranha film. Yet, this sequel to Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror movie Alien is beyond anything fans of the series or straight action fans could hope for. Certainly if you haven't see it by now, you owe yourself that favor. While the first relied more on quiet tension and dark corners to introduce its horror, this sequel starts out as such with no aliens even making an appearance until after the first hour. After that though, it's all war.This is the sixth James Cameron film I have seen and his talent continues to amaze and astound me with every movie I watch. His vision is so unique, so ambitious that even if the story is less than impressive (a la Avatar), I cannot deny the incredible attention to detail and outstanding production designs implemented in this film. The buildup Cameron creates is breathtaking. Just when you think boredom will set in, something happens and it isn't a simple alien jumping out at you either. Imagination is crucial here as we are forced to try and paint a picture in our own mind what is happening, only for Cameron to blow us away in the final third of the film with some of the greatest action sequences ever created. Another element that separates Aliens from other standard, cardboard sci-fi action movies is the emotional factor, which most movies have none of. Cameron includes a young girl taken under Ripley's wing to maintain audience emotional involvement the rest of the way through. What also sustains our involvement is the performance of Sigourney Weaver, perfectly cast as Ellen Ripley who maintains her tough exterior but isn't afraid to show her maternal side to the young girl.I really cannot praise this film enough. Sure, some will be turned off by the fact that the last half of this film is essentially one long action sequence that is very violent and over-the-top. However, I praise Cameron for doing this mainly for two reasons: it is extremely well- done, and it never loses steam. So many other movies of this genre are poorly made, unable to have any sort of staying power in terms of its suspense and excitement and by the end essentially give up altogether if only to wrap up the film. Cameron is so far beyond what directors like Roland Emmerich are capable of it's not funny. His films demand to be seen, enjoyed and repeated. Aliens is no exception and for my money, stands just behind 2001: A Space Odyssey as the greatest science fiction film ever made.",9,0,0,25 May 2010
Dallas Buyers Club," Matthew has AIDS
","Dallas Buyers Club is the type of film that seems to only receive the green light if a brave enough, or obtuse enough, high-profile actor attaches himself to the project, usually as both starring lead and producer. Matthew McConaughey joins the list, following in the footsteps of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and others. However, none of them changed their physical appearance to quite the dramatic level McConaughey has. Losing nearly forty pounds for the role of Ron Woodruff, a Texas man diagnosed with AIDS in 1985, the pasty, sallow skin stretched over a diminished skeletal structure certainly is a shock to most audiences, especially considering McConaughey is best known as a genial, strikingly attractive lead in various romantic comedies. Moving away from that genre since 2009, McConaughey seems to have gotten tired of being boxed in as an actor and has put together a most impressive resume capable of showing his true potential as an actor. This is his most 'method' performance, comparable to the likes of DeNiro in Raging Bull, although to the opposite extreme. Yet, beyond simply losing weight and gaining a mustache, McConaughey really digs deep into this character, willing to go to any length to show his drug abuse, unsafe sexual behavior and overall self-destructive tendencies as being rooted not just in Woodruff's life but in his community as well. Many of the early scenes in the film depict him at his favorite hangouts: the rodeo, where he seems to constantly hustle others, the bar where he downs shots and cigarettes like candy, and work where he shoots the breeze and more cigarettes. The main problem with the film is that just about covers its character study of Ron Woodruff.As the film progresses, one gets rather frustrated at the seemingly inept structure and logic behind this story. For example, after being told that he has AIDS, Woodruff refuses to believe it, which follows what has already been shown. However, after some confusing visual tactics and a couple blank stares into the camera, he moves voraciously over books and articles, finding out enough information to be able to search out a certain drug he has read will slow down the HIV virus. Obvious to anyone who has seen this sort of rebel with a cause story before, the hospital and FDA refuse to give him anything more than a place in a study they are performing attempting to find out the effects of this drug. Rather than die by chance, he travels to Mexico, gets in contact with a formerly licensed doctor and discovers, or at least believes without much conviction, that there are alternate treatments which are not available in the U.S. due to said FDA. The battle lines have been drawn.What follows lacks the energy and conviction one would hope for in a film of this type. McConaughey is game for this role, ready to pounce at a moment's notice. The problem is that the director, Jean-Marc Vallée, refuses to let him loose. Countless scenes seem so restrained and controlled that we get little sense of a man on the verge of dying from an incurable illness, which I can only imagine must be one the most terrifying and harrowing feelings possible in life. However, the film does not seem interested in such feelings, only in pushing the narrative forward but even that is disjointed at times. Jennifer Garner's frumpy doctor, with no life outside of work other than sitting at home and drinking wine, lacks any real interest or importance at all. So when she confronts Ron about a very serious development in the story, her lines come across as static and silly. How could she feel the way she claims to if we have seen little of this behavior? The other noteworthy performance beside McConaughey is Jared Leto, an actor who seems to wait out for these kind of roles. Playing a transvestite and looking like the lovechild of Sigourney Weaver and David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, he too is game for going all in and leaving nothing to the imagination in this portrayal of two men on the brink of death and willing to go all in. Yet, the film maintains its breadth-over-depth stance. By the end, all we are left with are more questions about who exactly this Ron Woodruff was. Scenes involving his starting up the buyers club have the only true excitement and movement in the film. He travels the world looking for exotic and unavailable drugs and doctors who will write prescriptions for him. It's a sad fact when these are the most interesting sequences in a film revolving around people dying of the most devastating disease discovered in the last century. Perhaps Hollywood isn't ready to tell this type of story yet. Philadelphia was close but got bogged down in cliché courtroom sequences. This film bogs itself down by relying on obligatorily timed moments that leave nothing to chance. This may make for a safe story, but it cannot fit the true happenings of a person battling AIDS.",Null,3,5,3 December 2013
American History X," Stunningly powerful.
","Once again, Edward Norton delivers one of the best performances I have ever seen an actor do in this brutal, explosive, and powerful tale about the ideas and influence of racism in America. This is a heavy film with some great suspense moments, however nothing really jumps out at you despite the film being just around two hours long. The whole time I was amazed and transfixed by the acting and writing, but it never really shocked me in the way I expected to be. In my opinion, this is the only factor in keeping it from being a perfect film and one of the best of the 1990s. As mentioned before, Edward Norton proves he is arguably the best actor of this generation with a phenomenal performance that makes him so evil in black and white, as well as being able to sympathize for him in color. The supporting actors are good as well, and the directing and writing are equally strong. Certainly a film to see, American History X is stunningly powerful.",9,0,2,30 April 2008
Tropic Thunder," Unbalanced in many ways, but very funny all throughout.
","Ben Stiller does terrific work as director, co-writer, co-producer, and star in this hilarious send-up of past Hollywood films dealing with the Vietnam War as well as a send-up of Hollywood in general. There are jokes in this script many movie lovers will get as well as ones only hard-core film buffs will laugh at, but it is all in good fun and it is obvious that all the actors are having a great time.Stiller plays Tugg Speedman, a former action star on the downside of his career, Jack Black is a heroin addicted comic star famous for his fart movies, and Robert Downey Jr. gives the film's best performance as Kirk Lazarus, an Aussie actor who completely immerses himself in his roles, this one being an African-American platoon sergeant. Other supporting roles include Matthew McConaughey as Speedman's agent, Steve Coogan as the exasperated director, and Tom Cruise giving one of the best cameos I've ever seen as a foul-mouthed studio executive in charge of production.All cameos aside, the real treasure of this movie is the huge number of jokes and spoofs being shot out left and right. They come so fast at some points it is hard to get them all. However, if you listen closely, you will get some of the big laughs and there are quite a few here. So, all in all, I think this is the funniest movie of the summer with some great acting, a lot of action, and a skin-changing performance by one of the best in the business, Robert Downey Jr. Get some.",8,3,12,5 September 2008
Legends of the Fall," A great epic amidst beautiful landscape.
","Edward Zwick's epic tale of a family struggling against the internal forces of nature that threaten to tear the family bonds apart is one of great acting, beautiful cinematography and strong writing that covers many years but doesn't drag on forever like some movies. The cast is headed by Anthony Hopkins as the Colonel, a former US soldier who dealt with the Indians in the late 1800s but now feels angry at the government for their way of treating them. He retires then secludes himself and his family to the remote areas of Montana along with his three sons. Then, years later, the youngest returns from school with his fiancée Susannah, played by the beautiful Julia Ormond. This sets the ground for heartbreak and sadness as well as beauty and love for all these characters.As mentioned before, the acting is superb led by Hopkins, Henry Thomas as the youngest, most naive and idealistic son Samuel, Aidan Quinn as the oldest and responsible son Alfred, and Brad Pitt as the wild and fearless middle son Tristan. This is perhaps the role that Pitt really broke out in and cemented him as one of the biggest stars of our time. Ormond is good too, although it seems she feels a bit overwhelmed amidst all this testosterone. What really gets to you, though, is the cinematography which perfectly captures the beautiful and seemingly endless landscape that is the American West. Set against this backdrop, there is great drama with war, love, death, and many other aspects of life in a story reminiscent of Doctor Zhivago or Giant.All in all, this is a great movie very well directed and written and perfectly capturing the era of the time. The ending is a bit ubiquitous but is still a good way to cap a great story that is timeless in manner and context.",9,0,2,9 October 2008
No Country for Old Men," Everything you've heard is true.
","Whatever has been said about this film is completely true. It is one of the best films of the year, it is the best Coen brothers film since 1996's Fargo, and it is a top-notch thriller that keeps you guessing and wondering what could possibly happen next. From the startling beginning to the abrupt ending, we are always left guessing. And that is the way it should be, since none of these characters really know what is going to happen next either. From a technical view, this is perfect film-making. The camera movement is amazing. The cinematography is beautiful to look at amidst all the blood and violence, and the acting is incredibly accurate. Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, Kelly MacDonald and Woddy Harrelson are all fantastic in their respected parts. However, as it has been reported, the best is Javier Bardem, whose performance as a ruthless, cold-blooded, heartless and ultimately inhuman killing machine is so real and shocking, you might think this is Bardem's job. He deserved every award he got for this role, and he will walk away with Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars on Feb. 24. Overall, this is an amazing production. We aren't quite sure how to react to this, but think about it some more and a solution may come to mind. As for the Oscars, I believe this will win at least Supporting Actor, Director(s), Adapted Screenplay, and Cinematography. As for Best Picture, that is between No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, and the Oscar voters. Let the votes come in.",10,3,7,8 February 2008
Batman Begins," The start of something truly spectacular.
","This is certainly, without question the best Batman film ever made, although that isn't saying much. Christopher Nolan makes this into a very dark and brooding tale that tells more about Bruce Wayne than Batman, something the other movies would never have done. Nolan is a great director and he takes a great leap of faith by showing perhaps the most important screen superhero in such a way that the city of Gotham and its components don't feel like taken from a comic book, but from real life. Batman Begins is based more on graphic novels and the original characters by Bob Kane, so the realism and details are there without all the fluff and showboating Joel Schumacher would have put out. Christian Bale is perfect as the title character and he creates a more interesting Bruce Wayne than Batman only because we see more of Wayne in this installment. All other roles are perfectly cast, especially Liam Neeson as a mysterious yet intelligent and brutal member of the League of Shadows. Katie Holmes is nice and sweet as Wayne's childhood friend, and there will never be another Alfred as long as Michael Caine resides.Simply put, Batman Begins is worth the time and money. It pulls you into a world you would never expect to see in a Batman movie, than transports you to Gothan City, the rotting core of it mostly. When we do get a glimpse of Batman, it really is quite different than other interpretations. The action here is based more on suspense than violence and the plot moves along quite well to make this movie feel shorter than its 140 minute running time. So, if you are going to see The Dark Knight this weekend, be sure to check this out first. Indeed, if it is anything like this one, this franchise is going somewhere truly spectacular.",10,5,6,18 July 2008
Twilight," All they're missing is a cape.
","I must start this review by saying that I am not the audience for the books of Twilight, so the movie probably wasn't made for me either. Still, I intended to see the film in hopes of it being able to cater to all fans whether they were interested in it because of the novel, or simply wanting to see a good fantasy film about teens and vampires.Unfortunately, the film misses on a lot of what it intended to do to bring in outside viewers and that is a shame because had it done better in some categories, it could have been more accepted by those not interested in reading the books. Nevertheless, it certainly has been a big hit with lovers of the novels, as will the next one which is due in theaters next week. I didn't expect to love it but I had hoped to embrace it as the Romeo and Juliet movie of this generation. The actors certainly help with it there as Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are both very adequate as Bella and Edward, the human and vampire in love with one another it seems because they like to be alone together. Stewart can be a bit too lacking in emotion at the most emotional times, but still manages to carry the role of a young girl just drifting through life until she meets the dark and mysterious Edward. And as this moody and unpredictable fellow, Pattinson shows he was the best choice not only because he is quite handsome, but also because he has the acting chops to pull off the mood swings and insatiable lust for Bella very few others could. Together, they do have serious chemistry and they will probably be voted years from now as one of the best on-screen couples of the movies.What is missing is the bite, for lack of a better term, of the story. It is a fantasy, but there are some elements that do not make sense even in a fantastical world. For example, why exactly does Edward seem so obsessed with Bella? And why does she return this same sentiment despite the fact that in the first 20 minutes of the movie he flees from her like the H1N1 virus. Perhaps we are supposed to just believe it but I wanted more credence. I also wanted more back-story on the Cullens and their abilities to do what they do. They have super-speed, super-strength, and see visions of the future. All that's missing is the superhero cape. Still, I was unimpressed with how director Catherine Hardwicke and screenwriter Melissa Roseberg seemed to tiptoe around the meat of the story, which lies not in the romance between Edward and Bella, but the why and the how of the situation. To really establish true emotional content in these characters would have lent the movie true credence and given the audience something to care about in these characters. Instead, we just get shots of the two looking at each other intensely and sweeping helicopter overviews of the evergreen forests of Washington.The best thing here, besides Pattinson, is the supporting cast, particularly the kids Bella befriends at her new school. They are funny, goofy and lend a realism to the story the rest of it seems to lack, despite the material. Also, the special effects depicting the vampire superpowers are quite unimpressive. I do hope the new film gives more thought and time to the vampires than just blurring their speed and editing choppily as they scale trees. As books, I am sure Stephanie Myers was able to establish exactly what was needed to believe and feel for these characters. Unfortunately, the transition to the screen loses something in translation and even though it will always remain a hit, I will always wonder if it couldn't have been a hit and something more...",6,1,5,12 November 2009
Before Sunset," As painfully honest as possible.
","Much less of a sequel and much more of a continuation of two people's lives and the trajectories they lead towards each other, Before Sunset is that rarest of films where all the drama occurs not in kinetic action or extravagant sets, but rather in quiet, calm moments on small side streets of Paris through some of the best dialogue ever put on screen.Indeed, at times it is hard to believe this dialogue was written since it feels so realistic and is delivered so fluently it comes off as real speak as opposed to staged words. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy sparkle as never before, cementing themselves as one of the best screen couples in the history of cinema. The romantic tension is palatable but so are the truths they thrust upon each other. They reveal their deepest of emotions and turmoils, establishing again that connection they found between themselves in one night in Vienna. Over the course of just over an hour, they do the same again, this time showing how nine years has aged them both physically and emotionally. They seem more relaxed, at ease in one another's presence. Jesse seems to joke a lot more than before, showing a vulnerable side he tried to hide before. By the end, which comes altogether way too fast, they are as connected and in tune as never before, realizing the fate of their paths and the importance of their relationship. Director Richard Linklater marvelously paces the film and the screenplay touches on so many truths and understandings about being a human in the modern world that it is worth watching just for the subjects Jesse and Celine talk about. However, the added bonus is the heart-tugging romance between these two that will stay with audiences forever.",Null,0,0,11 January 2013
Man on the Moon," Bizarre, eccentric, and brilliant.
","Man on the Moon is one of the few biopics that is able to completely capture the full persona of its subject, here being the revered comedian Andy Kaufman. The film really seems like a documentary as it perfectly captures the feeling of Kaufman's character; bizarre, off the wall, and totally original. The acting is key here, and it pays off big time. Courtney Love, Paul Giamatti, and Danny Devito are all wonderful as their respective characters who support and stand by Andy in all he does. The best performance, of course, is Jim Carrey, who is so real and convincing as Kaufman you wonder if he is still alive. The script is smoothly written and Milos Forman's directing is flawless. One of the best films of 1999, this is also one of the best biopics ever made.",9,1,2,28 March 2008
Saving Private Ryan," Far more than just a film...
","Steven Spielberg accomplished something here; something that may rival Schindler's List as his masterpiece and the greatest work he ever did in his extraordinary career. Here, with this film, he shows a side of World War II we all have read about but never saw. While he couldn't completely make it a reality, watching this movie is about as close as any of us will get to experiencing such historical events like D-Day. That being said, this is so much more than just a film that chronicles the story of eight men sent to find one in the German-controlled areas of France. Spielberg here paints a picture of the price and the consequences of war and certainly doesn't glamorize anything. The first half hour of the film is almost exclusively set right in the middle of the action as US forces storm Omaha Beach and try to stay alive amidst the torrential downpour of bullets and bombs. This scene alone earned Spielberg the Best Director Oscar and makes this film one of the great war films of all time. Still, he takes it to another level and gives us characters that we can view as simple everyday men on a mission that they don't believe in trying to find a man they know or care nothing about. To be frank, this is more than a film. It is more than an experience. It is a lesson on war and the complications it brings and the sacrifice it requires. That is what makes this a classic and maybe the best war film ever made. These men gave all they could and something most of us will never have to worry about; they gave their lives and in turn saved so many.",10,3,5,27 May 2008
Foxcatcher," Distancecatcher
","Can a film be made with all the available technical prowess yet still fail in its ability to relate what it wants to the audience? It has happened before, though usually in science fiction or action- laced stories where special effects and mechanical devices override any characterization or human interest. Yet, in the case of Bennett Miller's Foxcatcher, the result is too much stylistic layout for the sake of not enough dramatic juice to let the story flow smoothly. Watching this film is like witnessing a car engine break down due to losing oil, transmission and coolant simultaneously; this movie needs its essential fluids replenished. So much has been said already about Steve Carell's performance, but is it anything more than a well-known comic actor under a lot of makeup and prosthetics attempting to disguise himself as a 'serious' actor? Of course, other actors have followed similar paths like this before, but Carell's acting seems too subdued to allow us to be interested in what he is doing. Bennett Miller has always been a director who likes to keep the audience at arm's, or even a parking lot's, distance, so it is hardly surprising that Carell is directed to perform so. Indeed, John du Pont is the most potentially interesting character because he is a seemingly walking paradox. He possesses a doctorate in ornithology, is the heir to the fabulously wealthy and prestigious du Pont chemical corporation. Yet, he is presented, with whatever historical accuracy that can be managed, as a quietly malevolent control freak with serious mommy issues and some ambiguous form of mental illness. All this is deduction, of course. The film has no interest in exploring who du Pont truly was or what motivates him to act as he does. Here, he is merely the lone villain, the obvious bad guy we are supposed to both fear and be fascinated with. In this regard, Carell is creepily effective, but it bodes no goodwill upon the film or our rooting interest in him. He cannot, or will not, be penetrated by the audience.Opposing this, Channing Tatum may end up being the most revelatory element about the film. Known previously as a handsome but absent- minded meat-head-type actor receiving roles based upon his looks rather than acting ability, Tatum here finds the perfect role for himself, utilizing the typifications of his career in order to portray wrestler Mark Schultz as just what he has been stereotyped as: a mindless, muscular athlete with little to no ability to separate himself from either his brother or the past they share. He wants to individualize and prove himself to be more than a mere fighter of men for sport, but he simultaneously desires leadership and direction within the context of a team and common goal to be attained. This he had with his brother, Dave, and he soon finds it to a weird degree with John du Pont. While the movie covers this unusual but symbiotic relationship, interest is maintained and Tatum proves himself to be a reliable and intense actor, walking in a slouch and keeping his lower jaw agape like a heavy-breathing animal. Then, the plot begins to gear forward, albeit with somewhat large jumps in plausibility or logic. Firstly, Dave comes to run du Pont's wrestling team with no explanation despite having rejected the same offer earlier. This is never cleared up. Then, the shift focuses from emasculated Mark to the unsettling strangeness of John du Pont as Carell continues to walk around, sometimes with a gun, but always lurking and watching hie beloved team of men and patriots training for American greatness in the upcoming Seoul Olympics. Finally, the inevitable element of this true story establishes its presence, forcing us to watch something that could have easily been left out in order to focus on the characters. Instead, it is presented as the denouement of a true crime TV special, shot abruptly and shockingly, but to no effect upon our sympathies or understanding.In his review, David Edelstein referred to Foxcatcher as 'a true crime story bloated into looking significant.' He mentions Miller's most lauded film, Capote, as having a similar detached quality, although that film seems to understand better its obsession. It may also help that Capote is a far more interesting character than du Pont, as well as the fact that Phillip Seymour Hoffman is better- suited for these kinds of roles than Steve Carell. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that Miller has shown himself capable of visually expanding somewhat thin stories into depressing, but admirable dramas where the look of things trumps nearly anything happening within the frame. Perhaps the one conclusion to be taken from this is that you can get away with this type of storytelling provided you have a fascinating character portrayed by a competent actor. In this case, Carell's brave performance is only that; a gimmicky attempt to distance himself from comedy while simultaneously distancing himself from the audience of Foxcatcher.",Null,0,3,6 January 2015
Lawrence of Arabia," An epic masterpiece and portrait of a great man.
","Without serious qualms as one of the greatest stories ever brought to film, Lawrence of Arabia shine bright and long throughout as the portrait of one of Britain's finest heroes and of a man who attempted the impossible and nearly accomplished it. More than just a fascinating story though, it is also one of the most well-made films with breathtaking cinematography in virtually every scene and flawless acting that more than carries the weight of the film. The heavyweights are of course Peter O'Toole as the title character, who perfectly captures the feeling of isolation and detachment Lawrence felt from his own people (English) and those he tried to help (Arabs), as well as Omar Sharif as Lawrence's ally Sheriff Ali, Alec Guiness as the determined Prince Feisal and Jack Hawkins as the loyal yet sly General Allenby.Perhaps the real heroes of this film, though are those working behind the camera, particularly screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson who cover lots of territory yet conceal it into a very cohesive script with some excellent scenes of dialog. And, of course, director David Lean shows his true talent at telling epic tales by flawlessly directing and keeping pace so that the film is long but never boring. If you love or even like movies, this one is a must-see. Long considered one of the finest films ever made, you will not be disappointed by any of it. Rather, it will leave you breathless, amazed, and dazed at the wonder of the desert and the history that took place in it.",10,2,6,14 November 2008
City of God," A masterpiece of foreign cinema.
","Foreign cinema is not new at making great films. Akira Kurosawa, Jean Luc-Godard, and many others have all made films that stand the test of time as well as any American classic. For the Brazilian cinema, City of God is that film. It is a perfect blend of three separate stories that all come together in the end. Telling the tale of how the main gangs in the City of God came to be, the film superbly balances the subject material of each story, never giving one more than the other. The screenplay is terrific; it never falters or sags and continuously keeps us guessing what will happen next. The acting is very good, a surprise since virtually none of the cast had ever acted before in a film. The real treasure of the film, though, is the visual style. The directing is superb with an incredible blend of hand-held, dolly shots, and track shots among others. The cinematography as well perfectly captures the gritty street life with excellent lighting and sets. Overall, the film is a cinematic wonder. It is quite possibly one of the best films of the decade and certainly one of the best foreign films in quite a while.",10,0,2,13 March 2008
Gone Girl," Occam's Boxcutter
","The institution of marriage, being a foundation of civilization since the dawn of man, has adapted to subsequent eras but, in some aspects, not necessarily improved. Problems between men and women abound regardless of the type of their relationship, resulting in various commentaries and insights as to possible solutions, either temporary or permanent. Yet, the central question remains: can two people, often complete strangers when initially meeting, remain faithful to one another and build enough trust to establish a meaningful and fulfilling relationship? There have been several notable examples but, as time seems to reveal, knowing more may result in understanding less. At last, we have a cinematic representation of the perilous ups and downs of the journey from courtship to romantic climax to marital pitfalls, all within the context of an increasingly cynical social construct. Certainly, the subject of strained marriages is nothing new to the movies, but David Fincher's adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel goes deeper, bleaker and more harrowing than any other film of its kind. Fatal Attraction was a childish affair compared to the Dunnes.As the film opens, with a rapid and nervously jumpy energy, Fincher gives a masterclass on how to establish mood in a thriller. Every scene is impactful, every shot built to further the tension and tighten the air. The conclusion seems fairly certain, and Fincher wants us to want that conventional denouement. After all, wouldn't that be easier and safer to digest than anything else? Yet, Fincher refuses to gratify our simplistic expectations. Flynn, in adapting her own novel, tightens up the pace and slightly alters the ending to create a remarkably paced and exquisitely fashioned narrative, but it is Fincher's trademark cool, detached visual style complete with complex shadows and hints of blue and gray that put the finishing touch on this experience. One simply cannot look away from this film. At the halfway point, the 'reveal' utilized deflates any and all expectations we may have had, only to overwhelm us with endless questions as to how, what and why. The rest of the film covers those inquiries, yet still retains a level of ambiguity and forlornness. We continue to watch because it is in our interest as thriller-fans to do so, but on a subconscious level, there is the knowledge that conventionality is out of the question.Fincher's stylistic, sometimes smug, modus operandi is exemplified through his extraordinary ability to cast perfectly. Long understood as an overtly-handsome, sometimes aloof actor, Ben Affleck carries this film thanks to the control and forced exactness of Fincher's directing. His aloofness, as several critics have noted, is utilized here to the greatest effect, causing the character of Nick Dunne to remain an enigma and a sympathetic man simultaneously. Very few actors could pull this off, but Affleck makes it look easy, using his broad, muscular body structure, puppy-dog eyes and down-turned smile to keep everyone guessing as to his true motive. Motive is more crucial here than in most thrillers. Flynn's story questions the deepest expectations and assumptions we make about other people, particularly those we think we would like to spend a significant portion of our life with. Affleck can reflect this as can Rosamund Pike, whose Siamese eyes, creamy skin and sultry voice give nothing away about herself, keeping our guesses constant throughout. Early scenes between Nick and Amy, showing their attempts to win each other over, can only truly be understood in light of the entire film, an aspect of Flynn's novel Fincher exploits particularly well. If nothing is as it seems, what are we supposed to presume could or will happen? As the authorities track the clues as to the whereabouts of Amy Dunne and Nick's involvement, the notion of the simplest answer being best arises. This is frequently a logical error, yet on a certain level that may be the best method of approach. Applying this train of thought to the director, it has been argued that nearly all of David Fincher's films have been an attempt for him to overcome the frustrating and creatively-retarding experience on his first feature, Alien 3. While remaining a simple critical tool to find thematic relations amongst an otherwise diverse career, this notion is tempting to grasp. If there is any truth to it, it may be that Fincher has finally gotten the quality of clout needed to be able to make exactly what he envisions. He has often said he usually gets about 70% of his vision on screen, the rest being compromised out. Somehow, this film feels uncompromising. It is exceedingly dark, foreboding in its attitude not just towards marriage but humanity in general. Questions will abound, but answers often remain just out of reach.",Null,9,17,20 October 2014
Schindler's List," Spielberg's best.
","Steven Spielberg delivers his masterpiece here in telling the very unknown story of a German Nazi Party member who became the savior for over 1100 Jews during the height of the Holocaust. This is very dark material and Spielberg was wise enough to film it in black and white obviously to emphasize the bleakness of the situation. Here all the elements come together and mesh fluidly. The acting is superb with Liam Neeson perfectly capturing the multiple emotional cycles that Schindler went through. At first, he is happy and wealthy yet struggles with the relationship to his wife. As the story progresses, he becomes more saddened and shocked at the horrific events that are taking place on Jews in the local towns of Poland. He then decides to use the immense wealth he has gathered to try and save those that worked for him in Poland before they were moved to concentration camps towards the end of WWII. This is not a happy story at all, and yet there is something so beautiful about this picture. When I first saw it, I cried at multiple scenes. Now, after seeing it for the second time, I was more taken aback and could only watch in awe as a simple German businessman did something that only a handful of human beings would have the courage to do. He went face to face with multiple SS officers, including the demented head of the camp Amon Goeth played sinisterly by Ralph Fiennes, in order to save all he can. The last hour of the film showing Schindler collect all his money together so he can pay for the Jews to move them to safety can only amaze and stun you as we watch one man risk and sacrifice all he owns for the benefit of 110 strangers he knows nothing about. Here it is all about the quality of human life and how important one person can be to so many others. This truly is one of the greatest films ever made and it is in my mind the best of the last decade. Not to be missed by anyone, Schindler's List is more than a film; it is an experience of a n event that I pray will never occur again.",10,9,13,20 May 2008
School of Rock," The power of Jack.
","Though directed by the great Richard Linklater, Jack Black is the true heart and soul of this movie. His passion, energy and enthusiasm are so infectious that it allows the rest of the actors to loosen up and try to keep up with him. That being said, all the child actors are rather well- cast and do a good job of playing both disciplined, well-behaved and capable of rocking.As for Linklater, a well-renowned independent director, he keeps his style to a minimum, wisely focusing on the story at hand and allowing Black to go wild in his performance. Though a lesser work for Linklater and not much in terms of repeat viewings, this is still a well-crafted film that makes for a great 100 minutes of rock and roll entertainment.",Null,0,0,9 January 2013
The Man Who Would Be King," Absolutely entertaining from start to finish.
","John Huston's impeccable buddy film, one of the great lost classics in American cinema, is more than just a great buddy film but also a mediation on the British place in India as well as the consequences of power and riches. Sean Connery and Michael Caine are perfectly cast as the gruff, fearless Daniel Dravot and the sneaky and thoughtful Peachy Carnehan, respectively. These are two of the finest actors based on their own credentials, but here they put all that aside and give us two characters that have been through a lot together and are willing to put it on the line in order to find their dream: head for the mountains of Kafiristan and make themselves kings of the country.As the adventure starts out, we see the two friends meeting up with the famous British writer Rudyard Kipling (Christoper Plummer) who seems to have some important words for these two. They set out and face many obstacles and when they arrive they put their plan into action. I could go on as to what they do or what the outcome is, but that would spoil the outright fun of this wonderful tale of high-risk, action and adventure. As mentioned before, Connery and Caine are perfect in each of their roles, balancing each other and giving us a clear portrait of the British mindset at the height of their power. Huston directs with bold and outrageous shots of mountains, crowded marketplaces and vast kingdoms. In many ways, this reminded me of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, perhaps Huston's masterpiece. Just like that tale of greed for gold in the mountains of Mexico, this is a cautionary tale of greed in the mountains of Afghanistan. I encourage anyone interested to see this film; as unappreciated as it is it is just as enjoyable.",9,3,6,10 April 2009
The Hurt Locker," A man lost in a foreign land.
","The Hurt Locker does not attempt to make a statement on the United States' condition in Iraq, nor does it try to explain the technological aspects of how to diffuse a bomb. All of this is assumed as the first thing we see on screen is a title card reading, 'war is a drug.' Of course this only applies to some people, but it definitely applies to Sergeant William James, the new leader of an EOD squad in Iraq.For James, the ability to put on a large suit and walk up to a detonator and try to stop it from going off is a pleasure; he revels where most men would refuse to go once, much less hundreds of times, which James claims to have done. This attitude towards his work isolates many of the people around him, more specifically the two men he is to work in close proximity with, Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). Both think he's crazy to want to be that close to the action that much, but what can they do but cover for him and hope he doesn't die? Director Kathryn Bigleow is a name many may not know real well or at least associate with top-notch suspense. She will almost certainly get the attention she deserves now. With every scene, she builds to a climax you know is coming, just not when. She affirms herself the old Hitchcockian rule of suspense: a bomb under a table goes off is action, a bomb under a table not going off is suspense. In this case, a bomb actually applies. Story-wise, there doesn't seem to be much of one, which could be one of the few quirks people have about it. But, as I said before, this film is not trying to make a statement about the war nor give us hardly any insight into what entails the jobs of these men. Even still, there is a slight thread of the Sgt. James character, who is essentially addicted to the adrenaline rush of gambling with his life while trying to take apart a bomb.As for James, it is with the complete performance by Jeremy Renner that totally sucks you into this movie. You know he isn't like other soldiers; he has a more sadistic sense of humor, he goofs off quite a bit and takes his job and himself way too loosely. Yet, perhaps for these reasons we like him and follow every step of the way he moves, tensely wondering what will happen next.As the Oscars approach, the race for Best Picture almost certainly comes down to two films of the most ironic of senses. The Hurt Locker, made for $11 million and barely getting a theatrical release and directed with sheer intensity by Kathryn Bigelow goes up against Avatar, that monumental giant of a 3D blockbuster, made for over $230 million and grossing over $2 billion worldwide, directed by none other than Bigelow's ex-husband, James Cameron. For my money, The Hurt Locker deserves the big prize more if only because it goes deep to penetrate to some of the most human conditions: fear of death, fear of life, fear of what might happen to us in the next moment. Bigelow should almost certainly win the Best Director Oscar, and how deserving she will be. For it takes great skill and bravery to give us a war film that talks so little about the war, we start to forget what this guy is doing this for; his country or himself?",10,4,14,6 February 2010
La Grande Illusion," Duty bound despite differing social and political affiliations.
","One of the reasons why Jean Renoir's Grand Illusion holds up so well some 70 years after its release is because it isn't wholly about war. It is on the surface and to a degree, but like The Great War it inhabits, this is a film depicting the two key countries of Europe in the first half of the 20th century attempting to cooperate and even be amiable to one another. In a sense, this is a brilliant social exploration of two very different groups of people that have much more in common than they realize.France and Germany were the key settings for WWI; after all, probably 75% or more of the combat was at the Western Front, that horrific, brutally long death trap known as 'no man's land.' Because of this and the issues building up between France and Germany at the time of this film's release (1937), it is crucial to have a slight understanding of the background between these two very proud but somewhat stubborn nations. With this in mind, it is much easier to see why these characters act the way they do: they are living in the past at a time when the whole world is shifting from the Victorian to the modern period.From a historical perspective, this film is fascinating in terms of understanding these characters' backgrounds and motivations. This assists in appreciating the film from a cinematic perspective, which is just as easy to do. Renoir films have a way of sneaking up on the audience as they tend to start out slowly, then gradually progress forward until they pack such an emotional and visceral wallop that you are hooked to the end. Here, Renoir uses his camera as a tool of information, panning over the various French prisoners and German soldiers, showing us numerous examples of how these peoples have much more in common than they would like to admit. Indeed, there is a great spirit of camaraderie as the Germans are more often than not somewhat civil to their French POWs. Renoir is telling us here that WWI could very well have been avoided and another world war needed to be treated the same. Along with beautiful camera work, the dialogue works at such a harmonious pace that it is just so wonderful to listen to these people talk. This is a rare occurrence amongst films today, so it must be appreciated.Overall, this is an exciting film not only for its cinematic value but also its value as a historical archive. It is a great instructive tool as an introduction into WWI and the modern era. It is also a touching and powerful story about friendship, loyalty and civility. Whether it is a pure anti-war film or not is to diminish its overall quality. Renoir is able to penetrate much deeper than just the surface.",Null,0,0,8 June 2011
The Illusionist," Good, but Neil Burger is no Christopher Nolan.
","After seeing The Illusionist, I felt that it might have been better to watch this first as I was comparing it to The Prestige the whole time. Of course, like I expected, it doesn't match at all the suspense or complexity of that incredible piece of work. Nevertheless, it is still a very well-made period piece with strong acting and some good twists and turns down the road. If you can sit through some rough patches in the first forty minutes, you will be satisfied with how it ends. Still, I have to recommend The Prestige. It has better acting, better direction, and the story is so much more deep and meaningful. See this for what it is, but see The Prestige for what it is as well.",7,1,2,4 June 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Magical, breathtaking, and wondrous.
","Certainly one of the best films of 2008, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a visual feast that feeds the eyes as well as a marvelous and touching story that reaches the soul. Directed by David Fincher, the man responsible for dark dramas such as Fight Club and Zodiac, nearly every scene perfectly captures the moments it is set in. This is crucial in a story that starts out in 1918 and goes to the 21st century. Every decade is meticulously crafted and created. The 20s, 30s, 40s all seem so real and sweep you up in its charm.Needless to say, this would be for nothing if not for some great acting, and here we have two of the finest actors in work today. Brad Pitt plays Benjamin nearly at all parts of his life, and yet we always can feel him there despite being covered in makeup and CGI effects. Towards the middle when he looks as he does in real time, there was only one thought going through my mind as I watched him on screen: This man is a movie star. He has the looks, the body, the charisma and the smarts to bring people along with him and convince us at every turn that he is this character. He should almost definitely be nominated for an Oscar and it shouldn't be a huge surprise if he wins; he certainly deserves it. By no means any less a star but more of an actress, Cate Blanchett also deserves serious buzz as Daisy, a beautiful dancer who captures Benjamin's heart and joins him on this unusual journey. Taraji P. Henson also is spectacular as Queenie, the woman who nurtures and cares for Benjamin and loves him perhaps more than anyone else.All in all, this is a well-told story that I believe a lot of people will reckon with and recognize as a sincere work and a true example of the magic and potential of cinema. As mentioned before, the set designs and cinematography are staggering and Oscar-worthy as are the music, editing, direction, and of course the picture itself. I'm not sure if its the front-runner, but it will be in the thick of it come February. And why not? Such a breathtaking and terrific piece of entertainment and nostalgia that captures a series of moments in all parts of the world. They come together and make up one life; something so precious and important yet gone so soon.",Null,0,2,30 December 2008
Transformers," Way too long
","After finishing watching Transformers, I was at the same point I was about two hours into the movie: I stopped caring. You aren't supposed to expect much considering the whole trailer was basically a bunch of super robots banging the metal out of each other and the fact that Michael Bay directs adds nothing to it either. Still, I felt that it could be a decent film, and it wasn't. Shia Lebeouf is superb and I hope he has a great career, but even he can't hold this together. Meagan Fox is in this only because she is smoking hot, and pretty much every other character is underdeveloped or completely obsolete. Let's face it: this is all about the robots and watching Optimus Prime take on Megatron. I am not an action movie fan, but even I can appreciate the special effects here; they are truly astounding. Still, there is no story and did I mention this is almost two and a half hours? That is way too long for any action movie, much less one with so little a story. Those who are fans of the toys love it, but those who expect more out of their cinematic experiences should move on to bigger and better things.",5,1,3,9 April 2008
Garden State," A touching piece of work.
","Zach Braff, the lovable Dr. Dorian from Scrubs, shows his true talents in this remarkable indie film from 2004 that is hopefully the first of many from this talented writer/director. Braff does a great job of pacing the film and balancing each scene with moments of dark humor and touching dialogue that focuses on life and the unhappy moments that make it what it is. The script is very well done, although a few scenes could have been cut in my opinion. The acting is terrific, with Natalie Portman giving the best performance as a bubbly, energetic girl who shows up in Braff's life and tries to lure him back into the human race after being distant for so long. Indeed, many scenes effectively show the loneliness and distraught that Andrew Largeman and many of us go through. Perhaps it isn't an ideal ending, but it works for me. It is touching, warm, and it gives hope, which is what we all need after going through tough times. In my opinion, Braff is a genuine talent and this film shows his vision perfectly. If he can continue to make films like this, Hollywood will be better off. Films like this say something about human emotions, situations, and ultimately, life itself. That is what films were intended to be and I hope more like Garden State come along soon.",9,0,1,15 February 2008
The Imitation Game," Imitation of Life
","The Imitation Game follows in a recent tradition of both British-based historical dramas intended to invoke sympathy and knowledge about incidents or individuals previously unknown or under-appreciated to the general public. Like The King's Speech, The Iron Lady or The Theory of Everything, it has gained much critical acclaim, but it also leaves one feeling rather empty at the end of it all; you sit there and ask 'Is that all they can invoke in us?' In the case of Alan Turing, portrayed here as a most eccentric mathematical genius attempting to crack impossible German military codes during World War II, there seems to be more emphasis on him and his hang-ups rather than his work. Of course, there are scenes discussing his attempts to fund and build an enormous electromechanical device capable of searching through innumerable possibilities of coded words in order to deduce what was more likely being used and what could be discarded. Thus, the possible codes are highlighted, allowing the Allies to use such information against the enemy.If this sounds somewhat technical, that is because much of the dialogue here is filled with cryptological jargon, a language only understandable to those involved with such activities or otherwise interested in the usage of code-breaking as a tool to win the war. Such an idea is understandable and relatable, yet the film utilizes it only as a plot device, nothing more. Perhaps this is because the filmmakers felt too much technical language would turn audiences off, but it seems more likely they simply underestimate those interested in Turing's accomplishments. The man himself is reduced to another recent pattern of so many films: the antisocial yet brilliant genius capable of winning over adversaries through his work despite any effort to relate to others on a strictly human level. In some ways, this pattern exposes studios' belief in audiences wanting to see people who they believe are a type of ubermenschen, super-beings capable of thinking and acting beyond our middling, common understanding.This is certainly how Turing is portrayed here, despite Benedict Cumberbatch throwing himself completely into the role. As affable an actor as in work today, Cumberbatch nevertheless gets caught up in Turing's supposed speech handicaps and nervous ticks without using them to explore the darker aspects of Turing's personality. His homosexuality, made such an issue in the trailers and advertisement of the picture, was in fact simply another aspect of his life he attempted to privatize only for it to become his undoing. Any connection between his attraction to men and his attraction to complex puzzles seems rather stretching, although the film makes attempts to do so. In particular, the name of Turing's ground-breaking machine which is used to break German codes is 'Christopher,' who is shown in flashbacks to be a boyhood crush from school and died when Turing was still young. Such a fabrication only exposes the film's desire to create something that never was; this movie has its own impossible codes that remain just that.Despite all this, Cumberbatch is capable of creating enormous sympathy for this rather cold, unfeeling man who nevertheless somehow (through plot contrivance) manages to surround himself with die-hard supporters, including the brilliant Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) who Turing proposes to though it seems he may be attracted to her in some way. Again, this is merely used for plot extension, and despite there being no disrespect towards Clarke as a woman capable of holding her own against the male-dominated cryptography section at Bletchley Park, it causes one to question just what was the true nature of this peculiar yet symbiotic relationship. The movie never bothers to answer.Perhaps, the questions not answered cannot be. Much of Turing's work was hidden by the British government until a few years ago due to its highly-classified nature, which only underlines just how far-reaching his ideas became. The movie ends with several title cards telling us what became of Turing; the final one saying that 'Turing machines' are known better today as computers. Whatever truth this statement holds still allows us little access to understanding just what exactly motivated Turing in his work. In this film, he does it simply because he is good at it and he seems unqualified for any other work. Such a simplification is hardly ever the truth, and indeed there are many other aspects of the film which have come under fire for either emphasizing the unimportant or otherwise completely misappropriating various facts to the wrong individuals. Specifically, Turing was not as autistic or antisocial as this film leads us to believe, which only goes to show how certain aspects of one's life often become the true motivation to make a film about someone and their achievements. It's not enough that Turing accomplished so much; he has to have done it through personal shortcomings which otherwise would have caused one of us 'normal' people to falter. How can we, then, sympathize with an ubermensch?",Null,1,4,21 January 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Outrageous bloody entertainment.
","Uma Thurman kicks butt and sprays blood all over the screen in yet another gem from writer/director Quentin Tarantino. Here, Tarantino pays homage to 1970s grindhouses, old vintage Chinese martial arts and Japanese samurai movies, as well as throwing in a little mix of Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns. Mix all together, and you have one of the most outrageously entertaining movies of the decade that keeps you watching from the shocking opening shot the cliffhanger ending. Even if you aren't a fan of Japanese anime or Chinese martial arts films, don't watch it for that. Watch it for the great acting by Thurman, Lucy Liu, Vivica A Fox, and Darryl Hannah, the breathtaking choreography during the crazy fight sequences, and the mind-blowing story that Tarantino has put together to entertain and shock us.

Jerry Maguire," Mediocre film, superior stars.
","For the movie Jerry Maguire, a story about a sports agent who feels he isn't being completely honest in life and decides to write a career-changing mission statement about his thoughts, there really isn't too much wrong with it. There also isn't too much right with it as it is pretty straightforward the whole way through and lags in a few areas. However, the bright spots far outshine the dim ones in this terrifically acted story that tugs on the heartstrings and gives an inside look as to how the sports business is run.Written and directed by Cameron Crowe, this has the feeling of an insightful drama that wants us to consider how we conduct our lives and be brutally honest with ourselves and those around us. Indeed, there are plenty of long monologues about people not being honest with each other and how that affects our lives. I'm sure most of us already knew that, but that doesn't take away from this movie and how great the acting is by Tom Cruise as the title character, Renee Zellwegger as Dorothy, the woman who believes in him, and Bonnie Hunt as the no-nonsense sister. The show-stealer, though has to be Cuba Gooding Jr., who won an Oscar for his role as a loud-mouthed by very loyal athlete that is keeping Jerry alive. Certainly not a bad film, but just a mediocre, Jerry Maguire is fun to watch and learn from.",7,2,4,6 October 2008
Paranormal Activity," Never tries to be more than it is.
","By now, I am sure many of you have seen or at least heard of the ultra low-budget horror film that is Paranormal Activity. I must say that I found it to be not necessarily shocking but more disturbing and unsettling, which is I bet exactly what the director intended to do.Unlike most horror or scary films made today, it does not rely on obviously fake special effects or on making the characters stupid in order to get cheap scares accomplished. Many people have said they think the first hour or so is unnecessary because not much happens and there are no scares there. This is true, except it is important because it sets up the final 15 minutes that will blow you away. Taking a page out of Hitchcock, this film follows the belief that taking time to set up a sequence helps make the payoff more effective. We start out by seeing a young couple living in suburban San Diego. We learn very little about them or their relationship, which also makes it more effective, and we can only see what the camera will let us. Of course, part of the reason this film has become famous is due to the fact that it uses mostly a standstill camera method in order to explain what is happening. Never once do we see something without one of the characters actually taking hold of the camera and showing us.Part of the genius of this movie is in the fact that it uses very realistic and even funny moments to make the scary ones more unsettling. We see the couple argue, tease and love each other. We can relate to them and we fear for their safety. This is in no small part thanks to the two actors, Katie Featherston and Micach Sloat, who seem to not even be portraying characters but simply doing what comes naturally to them.As the story progresses, more strange things happen and thanks to Micah's obsession with trying to figure this out we get to see nearly all of it. The ending comes at a great shock and though some will complain that it is too over-the-top or Hollywood-ish, it does deliver the biggest scare and helps end the film on a most ominous tone. So, if you haven't seen this gem yet, do so. Just like its father, 1999's The Blair Witch Project, this is downright, bare bones effective film-making. If only others would pay more heed to this.",9,2,4,29 October 2009
The Dark Knight," Honestly, what else is left to say?
","It's pretty obvious now, here only three days after The Dark Knight premiered in theaters that this movie is one of the best of the year as well as the best Batman movie ever as well as the best superhero movie ever as well as one of the better crime epics over the last fifty years. Critics and fans all over the world universally agree with the above comments. I have to say, I agree as well.There are multiple reasons as to why this film is so successful. The first and most obvious one is that of the performance of Heath Ledger. Like everyone else, Ledger creeps the heck out of the audience whenever he comes on screen and completely dominates every scene he is in. The character of the Joker here is so different from Jack Nicholson, even from the cartoon version in the animated series, which was quite good. Here, there are some jokes, but none too funny. Whatever the Joker does, he does only for self-entertainment or to cause extreme havoc and chaos. His character his developed enough to show that he has no remorse and even no reason to feel the way he does. If you want to spend money on a good movie, go see this one if only for Ledger's terrifying, Oscar-worthy performance, which is better in its short time than most other characters in whole movies.Other reasons attributed to this film's success is that of Christian Bale, who is just becoming more and more perfect as Bruce Wayne, the arrogant and smugly rich billionaire who has his own dark side in his alter ego. Bale is so likable and looks so good in the suit, it's hard to think that anyone else, even George Clooney, could play Batman. The supporting cast is good, including Maggie Gyllenhaal who makes the character of Rachel Dawes even better than Katie Holmes did, as well as Aaron Eckhart, bringing a warm and comfortable sense to the character of Harvey Dent, yet can still match the powerful sense of pain and anger he expresses when he is Two-Face.Still, perhaps the biggest reason why this film is not just popular but great is because of director Christopher Nolan. Nolan, already a hit with Memento, Batman Begins and The Prestige completely outdoes himself with flawless direction and incredible pacing during this two and a half hour epic that covers everything needed. The action sequences are some of the best I have ever seen filmed. The script from Nolan and his brother is really good with some excellent dialogue discussing serious subjects such as crime and the moral weights that affect all decisions we make. Mostly, this is more than a superhero movie. It feels more like a crime drama epic more reminiscent of Michael Mann or Martin Scorsese. The cinematography is perfect and completes the whole mood of this film: dark, depressing, and gloomy. Yet, there is still good being done in Gotham City.The Dark Knight is there and he will never leave. And while I wasn't completely satisfied with the way things wrapped up, I am sure it was the right way to do it. So, save your money and don't bother getting popcorn or soda to have during the film. This is a completely engrossing and captivating picture that requires all attention. It may just win Best Picture in February, and what a treat that would be.",10,4,9,20 July 2008
Into the Wild," An inspirational piece of work.
","Sean Penn, one of the finest actors of this decade, has put together a masterful work filled with incredible images and a touching story that speaks to us all about the basic essentials of life. Into the Wild tells the story of Chris McCandless, a successful college graduate who gives his money away to charity and goes on a journey heading towards the wild, beautiful nature of Alaska. His thinking stems from his home life, which was not that stable as a child. His parents fought constantly, and the alienation he felt from them only drove him to alienate himself from everybody else. He thrives by himself and does survive quite well for awhile. While traveling across the American west, he encounters a married couple of hippies, lovingly played by Brian Dieker and Catherine Keener, a young girl who falls for him, played by the remarkable Kristen Stewart, a corrupt farmer played by Vince Vaughn, and a lonely old man, portrayed by Hal Holbrook in an Oscar-nominated role.All these people influence Chris and he influences them. Penn paces this just right and constantly moves back and forth between the climax of the journey and the events leading up to it. By the time Chris actually plans to head straight for Alaska, we feel he's seen enough. He feels he hasn't. Chris is a young, idealistic, headstrong young man who wants to follow in the steps of his heroes: authors Tolstoy, London, and Thoreau. He wants to live off the land, alone, with no need to have contact with society, which he basically shuns. Us being society, it is hard at times to agree with him, but we also are drawn to him, as are most other people in the film. We want him to succeed, but just like Chris, we don't quite know what he is looking for out there. It may be peace, or freedom, or maybe simply God. Whatever it is, it's something bigger than himself, and he dies in the process.Despite this downcast ending, Sean Penn has made a remarkable film. The screenplay goes on a bit too long at times, but the direction is perfect. The cinematography is gorgeous, perfectly capturing the awesome beauty of nature not just in Alaska, but wherever Chris goes. This is a powerful piece of work that is nothing short of inspirational. If there is any film from 2007 you look up, it should be this one. It will motivate you to live life to the fullest and find that, 'Happiness is best when shared.' Just like Chris.",9,4,9,19 June 2008
Toy Story," Simply, the best animated film of them all.
","Disney used to be good, wholesome family entertainment that was not only clean but fun. Now, most everything they put out is outdated postmodern trash that portrays all children as geniuses able to rule the world and all parents as evil minions trying to keep their children from having fun. Thank God for Pixar coming to existence. Starting with Toy Story in 1995, they made a great family film that appeals to adult humor as well as children. They haven't failed since. They can do no wrong it seems, and I pray it continues that way. Of all their great films, this is undoubtedly in my mind the best of them all. It is also arguably better than any animated film Disney ever did, including the classics of the 1940s and 50s. The premise is so clever and daring in that it could go wrong in so many ways. It never does, though, and in a mere 82 minutes, it covers more information than many other 2 hour films. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have become iconic in their roles as Woody and Buzz. The animation and dialogue is so good it is as if they are really on screen arguing with one another. The supporting characters are also very good and funny. With animation, perhaps the most important aspect is the voice characters. Pixar has done a great job of not always going with a star to do the voices, but rather simply going with the one that fits the character best. Overall, Toy Story is superb film-making with a great script, wonderful voices and animation that still impresses despite all the technological improvements. Thank you, Pixar. I am truly grateful to you for saving animated films.",10,0,0,26 January 2008
The Graduate," Still Crazy After All These Years.
","There is much speculation that this film is not so much a classic anymore as the political satire and dark humor it is so well known for is not relevant in today's world due to the allowance of so much more in society. While it is true that we are not as tight on censorship as we were in 1967, this film still poses many questions and themes that ring true today. If anything, The Graduate stands tall as the simple tale of a love triangle gone terribly askew.Dustin Hoffman makes the most of his breakthrough performance as Benjamin Braddock, the neurotic, geeky, very nervous college graduate who really has no clue what to do with this life. Benjamin represents all of us in a way, especially those who have recently graduated from school or made a significant change in our lives. He finds himself ensnared in a very vicious game involving a seductive, rather unfriendly woman, Mrs. Robinson, played with remarkable flair by Anne Bancroft, and her beautiful, innocent daughter, lovely portrayed by Katharine Ross. We know, as well as Benjamin does, that having an affair with Mrs. Robinson is a mistake and can lead to nothing but trouble. So, why do it? Perhaps it is simply to try something new and exciting or branch out into the world or let off some stress. Whatever the reason, the deed is done and soon, Benjamin finds himself stuck between falling in love with the girl of his dreams and trying to escape the clutches of the controlling mother.This film is very good for many reasons. The best being that the three leads are very good, especially Hoffman, who perfectly captures what it must have felt like to be in that situation in the late 1960s, when everything is changing, but you feel like you're standing still. The script is very funny, particularly the scenes between Hoffman and Bancroft, which almost play off like a comedic parody. The story does an almost complete changeover as Benjamin changes his interest from Mrs. Robinson to Elaine. The film then becomes a chase to see if our hero (or anti-hero) can accomplish his feat. As the audience, it is difficult to identify or cheer for any of these characters. To us, they have all put themselves in this unhappy position and deserve their fate. Still, it is very interesting to see how this all unfolds. In this reviewer's opinion, the ending is sheer perfection.The climax feels more like an anti-climax, but that was probably the filmmakers's intentions. We see the couple we want to see, but they are not doing what we want them to do. Mike Nichols' direction is fantastic, especially from Benjamin's point of view. It all comes together to show what the cinema is capable of, and how people can ruin theirs and others' lives by one simple choice.",9,2,2,12 June 2008
Avatar," The two sides of a great director.
","The obvious and final debate about Avatar that pits the fanboys and 3D geeks against the plot-crazy and character-driven fans is whether or not the special effects and 3D setting is enough to entertain and drive home the film its entire running length of 160 minutes.Well, since I belong to the latter group, I say that Avatar does not deliver the entire way as the final third loses steam tremendously. However, to start with the positive, there is no denying that writer/director James Cameron is one of the best, if not the absolute king of visual effects and epic storytelling. Cameron, who revolutionized movies with the Terminator films, Aliens and Titanic, continues to do what he does best with amazing attention to detail and astonishing creations of action sequences that completely surround and delight all audiences. There can be nothing bad said about the look and sound of the film, but there can be for the storytelling; heavy on storytelling and light on story.People will say that I am missing the real reason for this movie and I am looking too hard and expecting too much, but really am I? Is it wrong to want a story with very strong, independent-minded characters that come alive through the acting and not just their physical traits? Many say the movies were invented to tell stories like Avatar, and I cannot disagree with that since film is a visual medium and Avatar is that. But, there are times when it is all visual and the substance to support everything else falls to the wayside in order for Cameron to dazzle and amaze our eyes. This I do not mind, but I wanted a nice balance of visuals and plot.With all the incredible visual touches, it is unfortunate to not get a more original storyline. Basically, this is 'Dances With Wolves' meets Star Wars 150 years in the future. The dialog is quite silly at times and the emotions of the characters are amazing in how they swing so strong from one scene to another. It is too bad such emotional and vital actors like Sigourney Weaver are hidden behind motion-picture technology while wooden actors like Sam Worthington are allowed to take center stage.Yes, I know, I am being too hard and critical of this movie. But then again, Cameron is being very ambitious. This is by no means a bad movie, but I think it will be remembered for its influence in technological aspects rather than being a landmark film; this did not change movies forever. I admire Cameron so much as a director, but it is Cameron the writer that gets lost in his own world at times. Still, seeing it in 3D was quite incredible and I loved watching Zoe Saldana take over every scene she was in. As if you haven't already, it is certainly worth seeing Avatar, but it is not worth heaping all accolades onto it.",7,0,1,9 January 2010
Up," There's only one way for Pixar to go and that is...
","Yet again, and why are we still surprised at this?, Pixar has dazzled and amazed all of us who believe that movies have the ability to rise above mediocrity and simple-mindedness no matter what genre. Gradually, these genius computer animators have grown more mature in their writing, bringing alive characters that perhaps kids would like but adults would almost certainly love. It seemingly started with Ratatouille, but these elements were evident even in Finding Nemo or The Incredibles. Here, it all comes together in an incredible array of sparkling animation and vivid storytelling that will show audiences once again that Pixar has a monopoly on animated films.There are sequences done here that no other studio would dare touch, much less for an animated movie (consider the silent sequence depicting Carl and Ellie's life together). But, Pixar is so far above the average and ordinary, they dare to dream and tell the story in a way so different and more effective. Our hero here is Carl Fredrickson, a 78-year old retired balloon salesman who has lost his wife of many years and is feeling the effects of pressure on elderly people by the world. He decides to pay tribute to his wife by attaching thousands of balloons to his house and float away to Paradise Falls, a secret place in South America he and his wife vowed to go to one day. However, things happen, such as an ambitious 8-year old boy scout trying to earn his final badge stows away and they find a giant, exotic bird named Kevin, and a dog that can talk named Dug. The more I think about this story, the more I like it. For my taste, it doesn't reach the magical levels of Wall-E, Ratatouille, or the the original classic Toy Story, but it pulverizes movies made for the pop culture crowd like the Shrek movies, Ice Age, and Monsters vs. Aliens.Perhaps the biggest asset to Pixar is Disney, which gives them a seemingly unlimited amount of resources to create worlds that are wondrous to experience. Every single one of their movies are at the top of computer animation for that time and this is no exception. The color palette which director Pete Docter is working with exceeds all levels of imagination and makes for a glorious adventure. And the characters are likable as well as not likable at some points along the way. A mixture of mirth and fantasy, Up is an adventure like no other. Kids may like it, adults will love it. And as for Pixar, there is only one direction for them to go and that would be... up.",8,1,2,3 June 2009
A Clockwork Orange," Dazzling and provocative; Kubrick at his creative peak.
","If there ever was a film that was shocking and twisted, yet so important and unique in cinema, that would be A Clockwork Orange. Stanley Kubrick, having just come off the success of 2001: A Space Odyssey, continued the most creative vein of his career with this adaptation of Anthony Burgess' controversial novel about gangs of young boys wrecking havoc amongst the streets of futuristic Britain.This film is so much more than just a look at the future of youth. Kubrick also is able to insert his brilliant visual style which works so well here with the subject material. For the first half hour, we are stunned, amazed at the vicious and cruel acts of Alex and his droogs. As the story moves on, under any other director the story would have become less titillating, but thanks to Kubrick's vision and a tour de force performance by Malcolm McDowell, this movie only gets better. We follow Alex through all aspects of his journey, and this is the key. By the final third, we find ourselves somewhat sympathetic for Alex despite his previous wrongdoings. Beyond this, there is also exploring the fact of whether state control is good or how much it takes until someone is devoid of their basic choice as a human being.Still, all these nuances aside, this is one movie not easily forgotten. With terrific performances, magnificent backing music, and flawless directing from one of the greatest of all time, A Clockwork Orange is a film to experience and think about for years to come.",10,0,3,21 January 2009
Reservoir Dogs," A very strong debut.
","Quentin Tarantino never ceases to amaze and stun with his films, and this is never more true than in his debut as writer/director of this American crime classic about seven men attempting to pull off the perfect jewel caper, but something goes terribly wrong. They suspect there is a rat informer among them, but who? What makes Reservoir Dogs so memorable is that it is so unlike any other crime drama, yet it fits that genre so well. It is violent, but only in a few scenes and the most horrific occurs off-screen. This film is unique because it tells the story backwards and gives us a better picture of the seven men and their interactions rather than the event that is the holdup. AS expected, the dialogue is the best part of the film and some of the best you will ever hear. The acting is very good as well, especially Michael Madsen as the calm, quiet, psychopathic Mr. Blonde, and Lawrence Tiereny as the head man Joe Cabbot. Really, if you are at all interested in film, this is a must see. Not only is it an American crime classic, it is an influential piece of work that set the stage for one of the best directors of the modern era and his masterpiece: Quentin Tarantino and Pulp Fiction.",8,1,2,12 May 2008
Eyes Wide Shut," The final chapter of the book of Kubrick.
","There is no real reason to argue that Stanley Kubrick was one of the finest directors to ever stand behind a camera. From Dr. Strangelove to 2001: A Space Odyssey to Full Metal Jacket, Kubrick was able to polarize and hypnotize the audience with his brilliant composition, camera movement, and incredible storytelling. Here, he explores the human desires to copulate and have intimacy with one another. What is interesting is that this is an issue we all know about and that the movie industry really seems to like, especially these days as practically every film made has a sex scene ore sexual reference in it. For Kubrick, he makes it more of a dream as the plot stretches off into wild and weird sections we weren't expecting and really kind of put us off in a way.As Tom Cruise's character begins to explore the sexual events that surround him throughout the night, the film feels more and more deliberately slow in pace as well as more strange in tone. I believe Kubrick is doing this intentionally in order to plunge us further in the mindset that Dr. Harford is unaware and confused of the events happening to him. That being said, it feels a bit too long and there are some scenes that don't fit with the rest. The first hour is really strong as we view the marriage bonds between the doctor and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) strain as they both face temptation. As we follow Bill into this fantasy of sexual desires and obsession, the plot gets weirder and the questions pile up. This is not to say Kubrick doesn't wrap things up but not everything is revealed.For me, this was not one of Kubrick's many masterpieces. I did admire the film for its insight on the reason of marriage and the ties it requires between two people. It also is very good in its atmosphere and set-up, which Kubrick always did well. However, I couldn't really get into it but that may be the reason behind the motives. For any Kubrick fan, this is worth checking out, but despite it not being up to his other stuff, there are definite traces of a great film here. It is only too unfortunate that he died so soon. One can only imagine what he would have done next.",7,0,1,4 February 2009
Some Like It Hot," An outrageous and hilarious comedy.
","Billy Wilder goes the limits in this outrageous and very funny comedy about two musicians going undercover as women to avoid the mob. It is a ridiculous premise, but Wilder and Diamond's script perfectly balances the comedy with scenes of love and romance. Curtis and Monroe have great chemistry together, and Lemmon is superb as the comedy relief in the 'serious' scenes with George Raft. Even these are something to laugh at, but the film is not to be taken seriously; just to be laughed at. It has been almost fifty years since it was released and people still laugh at it. I have seen it three or four times and it is still as funny as seeing it for the first time. That is the true test of a comedy and Some Like It Hot passes with flying colors. A true comedy classic all the way around.",10,8,9,2 March 2008
Inside Man," Suspenseful, yet very inconsistent.
","Spike Lee creates one of the most unique and interesting heist movies in recent memory with Inside Man, the story about a group of robbers led by Clive Owen that hold up a bank for all different reasons. The first half hour or so is pretty intense and interesting as we watch these four robbers force all the hostages to dress up exactly like them for a crucial reason later in the story. Denzel Washington plays a hostage negotiator trying to get the robbers to cooperate, yet he seems like such a weak character when he should dominate the screen. That role goes to Owen, who is so convincing as an unflinching bad guy as well as being very interesting so we actually care about what he is going to do next. Jodie Foster plays a 'fixer' trying to help Christopher Plummer get something of great value inside the bank. Unfortunately, that is all we learn of her. What fails mostly with Inside Man is the confusing storyline Spike Lee throws at us. He mixes in post-hostage footage with actual hostage footage, and soon it becomes confusing which is which and what came first. There are too many little revelations at the end instead of one big one. The acting is mostly good, especially by Owen, and the rest of the script is well done. But, Lee could have stayed more consistent and suspenseful. Instead, at the end, it doesn't feel as intense or satisfying as even Ocean's 11. Too bad with all this talent.",6,2,4,4 July 2008
The Godfather: Part III," Lightning hardly strikes thrice.
","To be frank and obvious, The Godfather Part III fails on many levels so that it cannot hold a candle to the first two. And should we really have expected it to be as good as Part I and II? The reason it was even made was because Coppola was strapped for money and felt he could give closure to this epic saga. More on that later, but first to focus on what went wrong in this continuation of the Corleone crime family.In this third story, Michael has aged considerably over the years and is now starting to decline not only in health but in his mindset of how to run the family. Mob activities are becoming more and more violent, something he is not necessarily ready for. He becomes involved with Vincent (Andy Garcia) who is the illegitimate son of Michael's brother Sonny from the first film. He has inherited his father's temper and ambition and hopes to help the Corleone family take on Joey Zusa (Joe Mantegna), a mob boss now running their New York business. Michael also gets involved in the Vatican and their running if large sums of money. This plot thread I thought was fairly ridiculous and uninteresting. Of course, the best things of the story are the family arcs and the relationships between these people.For the positive, the acting is good but not on par with what it was before. Al Pacino and Diane Keaton are both wonderful as Michael and Kay, two people with a lot of history but much to connect with each other. I do wish we could have seen more of the history of them and Michael explaining his actions in Sicily from the first film. Garcia is quite strong as is Talia Shire and Eli Wallach but Sofia Coppola brings everything to a halt with her very wooden and stiff performance of Mary, Michael's daughter. She speaks in one tone, has little chemistry with Garcia and has a weird contortion with her mouth that is distracting. Is it the worst thing of this movie? No, that would be the screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo, who seem to go out of their way to avoid doing what they did in the first two films. Those focused much on the family and the internal conflicts within. This part has a global span, going from Rome to New York to Sicily; it all seems too much for one movie.The burning question is: was this a necessary production? I think it was, for now we know there never will nor can there ever be a fourth film as well as the closure we do receive on these people. The best part of the film is the family itself and we continue to see development in many of the characters, especially Michael and his sister Connie. For me, Connie's arc was the best of this film as we watch this beautiful woman, who got married in the first film, seem to lose her way. She is conflicted with the fact that she loves her family but is appalled by the violence associated with them. What happens to her in this movie is shocking but also understandable as it was with Michael's transformation. That, of course, is the main theme of this saga. Pacino seems to ham it up a little here but is still very effective in his role as a man filled with demons of his past and trying to do anything he can to exorcise them.Why does this fail? Probably because we expected too much of Coppola. He hardly expected the first film to be so widely revered as it is, let alone the second film. Could he have known people wanted that same quality for this one. I am glad I saw it for now the story is complete to one of the greatest cinematic achievements.",7,0,1,7 December 2009
Mystic River," A gritty and powerful tale.
","Clint Eastwood's Mystic River is quite mystical for the simple fact that there is so much more going on underneath than above the surface, just like the river. There is a lot of symbolism here and that only adds to the complexity and power of the story. The acting is terrific with Penn and Robbins both giving Oscar-worthy performances. Bacon is underrated and Fishburne, Harden, and Linney all holding their own. This is heavy material and not easy to deal with, but director Eastwood handles it superbly, never delving too deep into unnecessary plots and not always going for the tearjerker. This is a straightforward, thought-provoking film that takes multiple viewings to understand it all. In my opinion, it isn't as good as Unforgiven or Million Dollar Baby, but it is still better than what most directors are churning put today, and I hope Clint Eastwood continues to do much of the same work that he did here.",8,1,2,7 March 2008
The Departed," Return to form, return to greatness.
","Martin Scorsese has long been seen as one of, if not the, great American film directors. Film after film, he has continued to explore new pathways and areas of both cinematic and storytelling greatness in classic films that have stood the test of time. The Departed is such a film.This was Scorsese's most mainstream film to date (it has since been replaced by Shutter Island), and it featured an all-star cast that very few directors could ever pull together. All gave standout performances, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. They are the key characters; everything goes through them and Scorsese uses close-ups of their respective faces to emphasize and emulate all the feelings and ideas he is presenting. With that in mind, they both are very convincing with the Boston accents, with the constant profane interactions and the extreme deviousness. Perhaps because they are both professional liars some viewers tend to criticize them more harshly; it can be difficult to feel empathetic for someone not necessarily true to themselves.The main underlying theme here is one Scorsese has tapped into again and again: guilt. Ever since his first film, Who's That Knocking at My Door? in which Harvey Keitel played a young man wary of his relationship with his girlfriend after finding out she was raped, the notion of guilt and its relation to faithfulness to the Catholic Church has dominated Scorsese's mode of thought. Here, guilt lies on all the characters. Each of them completely embody the new life they are to now acquire. Colin Sullivan (Damon) is a clean-cut kid with an immaculate record as well as a former gangster turned State Police sergeant. He is the perfect tool for Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) to use to keep the cops on their toes and his business alive. On the flip side, Billy Costigan(DiCaprio) is a kid with family connections to South Boston gangsters attempting to make it into the State Police. He is assigned to inform for the police into Costello's organization. Right from the get-go, Scorsese establishes the pain and pressure these two will face in regards to their professional compromise.Another buried element here is the idea of identity. What exactly is it to these men? What is their true identity and how can they get it back? Because Sullivan and Costigan spend so much time pretending to be what they are not, eventually they get caught up in attempting to succeed at a job that isn't really theirs. In some ways, Scorsese creates an atmosphere that is deliberately contrary to that of his 1990 masterpiece Goodfellas. In that film, everything rested on the joy Henry Hill had in committing crime and living the mafia life. Here, these emotions must be subdued, lest someone get caught and possibly murdered.In the end, I believe this is one of Scorsese's best films along with Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, After Hours, Goodfellas and The Age of Innocence. All of the aforementioned films tell stories of men conflicted with living how they are told and how they are able to. Here, Costigan and Sullivan symbolize that. On top of all the underlying themes, this is just a very well-made cop and gangster picture. The acting is superb, the editing is so sharp and jolting so as to keep the tension and suspense alive, the cinematography greatly captures the tender living conditions in Boston, and of course Scorsese's Oscar-winning direction corrals everything together to create one gloriously entertaining film. It is a return to classic Scorsese form as well as Scorsese greatness.",Null,1,1,15 January 2011
Psycho," Without serious rivals as the greatest thriller ever.
","One of the most famous of all films, so much so that people who have never seen it know about the shower scene, or can quote, 'A boy's best friend is his mother.' Yet, Psycho is so much more than 'that scary movie with the shower scene.' In fact, it is not even a horror film by any stretch of the imagination; Hitchcock was too sophisticated for that. This is a mystery thriller, the first part being thriller and the second being mystery.One of the elements that make this a timeless piece of cinema is the way Hitchcock sets up the back story to the character of Marion Crane and the relationship between her and Norman Bates. From the moment these stories begin, we start to get involved without knowing that Hitchcock is toying with us. I cannot ruin any spoilers, since this is a film to enjoy the first time and then maybe a second time. But, it is important to know that even though this has influenced practically every horror movie since, it is nothing like any of them. Hitchcock shot in black and white to not appear gory and used old-school tricks like music and editing to create images in our mind much scarier than on the screen.Speaking of music, has there ever been a more perfect score written for a film since this masterful work by Bernard Herrmann? In every scene it is used, it underlies the drama and increases the suspense in a way no modern director could ever do with blood and grotesque imagery.The cast is wonderful, especially Janet Leigh as Marion and Anthony Perkins as Norman. As good as Leigh is in bringing us to her side, Perkins gives arguably one of the greatest performances in all of cinema. The little details, the stuttering, the twitching, the eyes moving all around go unnoticed the first few times. Then, after awhile you notice it and see that he almost completely makes us sympathize with this character. If you've seen this before, you know what an incredible job it is, although it is a shame Perkins never got out from under Bates' shadow. What is even worse is that they made three sequels to this movie, focusing more on Norman and the violence that I am sure ensued. Forget those attempts to capture your attention and be sure to view this masterpiece at least once. That's all it takes before you will look at your mother a little differently.",10,1,1,31 May 2009
Rosemary's Baby," Remains at the high standard Polanski intended.
","Rosemary's Baby, unlike the vast majority of horror films, remains decades after its release as terrifying and unnerving as it must have been when it was first shown to audiences. This is due mainly to writer/director Roman Polanski and the universally believable and creepy performances of the cast. Having never read the book, what becomes apparent almost immediately is the overwhelming sense of dread hanging over these characters, despite the fact that the story starts out so innocently.Being Polanski's first Hollywood film, it remains astonishing how in control and consistent his direction of this film is. Never straining for cheap thrills or exploitative emotions, Polanski shows here why he is to be considered among the best of directors. Each shot sets up what will happen next and the screenplay does not create a situation in which he characters are acted upon by the impersonal force of the plot. Rather, it is the characters who inject the plot with occurrences, making the end result that much more believable and unsettling.As for the performances, Mia Farrow may never have found as iconic a role as she did with Rosemary Woodhouse the sweet, innocent, somewhat naive but very observant and intelligent young housewife who finds herself caught up in situations beyond her control. We empathize with her because her motivations are pure and she is as likable as a screen character can be. This is offset by the warmly creepy presence of the Castevets, played brilliantly by Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer. Even John Cassavetes, better known today as America's first independent filmmaker, gives a quietly disturbing performance as the loving husband who turns out to be something we could not imagine.Over forty years after its release, Rosemary's Baby continues to send chills up the spine and remains a watershed in horror film history. It needs no special effects or ugly creatures to inspire dread and fear. It does this the old-fashioned way: acting and direction.",Null,1,2,22 May 2012
Love Actually," All about that four-letter word.
","This is almost without question the ultimate romantic comedy. It certainly has plenty of each of those qualities, practically to the point of overkill and excessiveness. Yet, balancing out certain gratuitous subplots are others that are either impossibly sweet and charming or really bizarre and funny or perhaps even both.Writer/director Richard Curtis, no stranger to this genre, certainly had enough material here and was able to assemble one of the best casts of British actors ever. Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson and a plethora of over actors put real joie de vivre into their roles, expressing a form of happiness and satisfaction rarely seen in today's movies. Perhaps most impressive is that nearly ten years on, many of these actors remain in our memories in part because of this film. It has its moments of unnecessary storytelling such as that of the horny Brit Collin traveling to the US in order to sleep with the first woman he meets and the budding relationship between the two sex actors. However, there are other stories, especially that of the Prime Minister and one of his assistants and the unrequited romance between a man and his best friend's wife that give the film its true value.Some scenes are purely, beautifully emotional; others are totally strange, absurd and maddening. Then again, isn't love?",Null,0,1,16 April 2013
12 Years a Slave," A safe bet for audience satisfaction
","12 Years a Slave represents a late-flowering of Hollywood's attempt to continue the white-guilt trip regarding the American slave trade since Roots was an international hit in the 1970s. The exception, however, is that this film is far more superior in its technical qualities than nearly every other of its kind. It begins with the simple yet allegedly powerful statement 'This film is based on a true story.' Whether this is intended to get the audience to sit up and pay extra attention or simply to help prop up a rather deflated synopsis remains a unique element to singular films. Nevertheless, in this case, it seems to add nothing to the terror and brutality exhibited in the rest of the film. Herein lies a great discrepancy for the film's level of satisfaction: does a 'true story' translate to a more powerful and effective experience, and if so, does this imply that fiction has no relevance left?All this to say that, despite its misgivings about its audience's ability to absorb information, Steve McQueen's adaptation of Solomon Northupp's memoir of being kidnapped, sold as a slave despite previously being a freeman, and eventually brought back to his rightful position, does strike a powerful and memorable chord. This is helped in large part by the expansive, eclectic and effective cast which includes such diverse names as Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, and Brad Pitt. Yet, what struck me most about this film was the way in which it seemed to be so single-minded in its approach that it failed to see Northupp as a representative of American slavery in the decades prior to the Civil War. This is exhibited most apparently in the finale, which ends rather abruptly without any real sort of coda or satisfying cadence. This may very well be what McQueen intended, but it still diminishes the viewing experience as it limits the audience to experiencing only what Northupp wrote explicitly. In most cases, this would be fine, but the camera's ability to transcend its subjects and expand on its themes almost requires more than what the source material allows. In this sense, the film fails to live up to its billing. It seems that this was done most likely to keep a safe awareness of its time and place in the box office. This film will most assuredly be a front-runner for the Oscars next year, yet it has the opportunity to go far beyond more conventional or even exploitative tales of slavery such as Mandingo and, to a lesser but more entertaining degree, Django Unchained. McQueen was well on his way to showing the most realistic, truthful and even sympathetic portrayal of the relationship between blacks and whites during the 19th century. It's a shame he seems to pull back and give us a book report just at the moment when more exposition could have benefited greatly.",Null,1,9,13 November 2013
There Will Be Blood," A mind-blowing masterpiece.
","Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood is a stunning achievement on multiple levels that overlap and dissipate in the mind of the viewer. After seeing it the first time, I walked out of the theater bewildered and amazed. Certainly I had seen a great film; the cinematography, editing, direction, writing and acting were all the finest offered by American cinema. Yet, I wasn't entirely ready for the viewing. I had hardly heard of Anderson prior to this, so I couldn't put the film in its proper context.Having now seen all five of Anderson's features, I am still totally enthralled but also more knowledgeable of what his vision was and what it means. The main theme is the battle between two of America's central elements: capitalism vs. religion. Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) represents the former, shown as a giant of biblical proportions with and evil and demonic twist. Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) is the latter; smaller, weaker yet just as ambitious and pragmatic. Each side knows what it wants and is willing to go to any lengths to get it. The main problem lies within the conflict that arises from them getting in each others way. There is also the notion of parental neglect, something Anderson visits frequently in his work, and the effect it has on both the child and parent.As if the thematic material wasn't rich enough, Anderson has also crafted a finely-tuned piece of cinema that fits together like a classical opera. Each element is richly photographed by the great Robert Elswitt and sublimely edited by Dylan Tichenor. Anderson was fortunate in casting Day-Lewis, perhaps the Marlon Brando of this generation, and he uses him most advantageously. From the opening sequence, we understand this character is larger than life, fully formed and able to cause growth and pain simultaneously. Day-Lewis plays him full of fire, passion and blood-thirst in a performance that certainly won't be equaled for quite a few years. Anderson's direction also deserves praise. He maintains the pace and plot quite nicely, never letting it run off the tracks until it needs to; the final sequence. Many have criticized this move but after multiple viewings I think it was correctly done in order to show the final panorama of influence Plainview had on this community.This is not a film for the general audience, and I would advise anyone who is not a serious cinema lover to watch it. At times, it is quite confounding and like most of Anderson's work it can seem very pretentious. Still, if you are ready and willing to go down this dark path of American greed, cynicism and spirituality, Anderson and Day-Lewis are willing to take you there.",10,2,6,22 February 2008
The Bridge on the River Kwai," An epic tale of courage and heroism.
","David Lean began the strongest stretch of his career with this fantastic anti-war film based on a novel about a group of British POW soldiers commissioned to build a bridge for the Japanese army. Trouble arises, however, when the leader of the British, Colonel Nicholson played remarkably by Alec Guiness, refuses to work the way of the Japanese. Meanwhile, a team of British commandos is put together to go and blow up the bridge that is to be erected.Simply put, this is a masterful film that is terrifically well-made and builds great tension despite seeing it multiple times. The acting is very good all around, especially from Guiness and William Holden as the heroic yet cynical Shears. The cinematography is gorgeous as the scene is set in the jungle of Southeast Asia, and Lean directs at such a solid pace that the story never lags despite the film being two and a half hours long. Lean was a master at building a scene for a climax, and he does it very well here as we watch both sides of this story unfold and wonder what could possibly happen. All elements point to an award-winning, classic war film that will last for decades. And that is exactly what The Bridge on the River Kwai has become and will be.",9,1,3,11 November 2008
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Art of Addiction
","For whatever reason, Leonardo DiCaprio really wanted to play Jordan Belfort in a movie; so much so that he went into a bidding war against Brad Pitt's production company and won, though still having to wait several years before being able to convince his long-time counterpart Martin Scorsese to command the helm. Seeing these two names on the marquee certainly stirs the blood up in most people, given their track records both collectively and individually. Indeed, a mere five years removed from what is now becoming known as 'The Great Recession' allows for this material to continue to have relevance in our society. However, this would have been the case regardless because like Oliver Stone's Wall Street and Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story, Hollywood continues to reveal its infatuation with what is perhaps the most ruthless, notorious and powerful area in America.Honestly, the plot itself is nothing too original. The rise and fall of the protagonist with plenty of drugs, prostitutes, scandal and outrageousness along the way. Scorsese and DiCaprio, as well as writer Terence Winter, knew this all along, even going so far as to mention Gordon Gekko and a few other well-known Wall Street figures. The unique element this film seems to present is its sheer unflinching portrayal of everything excessive and extravagant about this lifestyle, and the self-satisfaction afterward of mission accomplished.Scorsese has never been a director to pull back and subtly craft his style; he is celebrated for the very reason of his viscerally lavish craft both visual and narrative. Having worked with him more and more, DiCaprio has carefully and steadily grown into perhaps the most fearless American actor today outside of maybe Daniel Day-Lewis. None of his other roles have required such out-of-control insanity, yet he handles it with the sure-fire steadiness of a true professional. Verging on the brink of camp, he always manages to stay right on course, keeping us interested in this character who narrates to the camera in a rather jovial manner of acceptance; he freely admits all his flaws and at times seems amazed at what he was capable of doing. In this film, Jordan Belfort loves the rush of addiction; he is willing to go to any length for any substance or satisfaction. Women, pills, cocaine, alcohol, yachts enormous enough to put a helicopter on top; all this is done with the smug satisfaction of a tested professional. In his own words, Belfort feels he 'can spend my clients' money better than they can.' How did Belfort get to this level? Like most memoirs, he has a fall guy: Mark Hanna. Appearing for a mere ten minutes in this three hour marathon, Matthew McConaughey gives a performance that should demonstrate to audiences and executives that he is one of the finest American actors around. No more can we blame him for sappy, empty-headed romantic comedies and the strange satisfaction with constantly taking his shirt off. He has proved himself more than capable in movies like Mud and Dallas Buyers Club, although nothing quite prepared us for this. One scene, one speech to DiCaprio lays out how this film and, perhaps, the brokers themselves view Wall Street, America and the human race in general.As mentioned before, this film continues to show Hollywood's fascination with the Wall Street broker lifestyle. Is this a cry for help or justification? After all, though they deal in a slightly different trade, it is even more well-known the excessiveness of movie stars and their circles. Maybe it's an affection between kindred spirits. Either way, it shows that once the powers that be begin to descend upon their happy existence, they soon turn upon the very culture and country which made all this possible. Certainly, one can see this and other films like it as an indictment of capitalism gone rogue; figures like Michael Moore will probably spin it that way. Yet, just like in his classic Mafia film Goodfellas, Scorsese prefers to look at people enjoying their addictions. Like his counterpart Henry Hill, Belfort narrates for us plenty of inside information to make us both desire and repulse this type of living. Of course, just desserts must be served. Yet, as many critics have surmised, there is an air of satisfaction from all these characters. Perhaps Belfort wrote his memoirs to prove to himself that he exceeded his own expectations of doing what he set out to do. This does not mean we have to admire him; we can only watch in abject astonishment at the possibilities America has to offer and the obstacles people are willing to scale for them.",Null,1,2,8 January 2014
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Visually staggering, which is all that is needed.
","Francis Ford Coppola is a great director, and his adaptation of Bram Stoker's widely influential novel, Dracula, is perhaps his most ambitious and technically impressive film next to Apocalypse Now. Taking a very famous story and recharging it with incredible cinematography and camera work, this is an incredible looking film; one that transports you back to the times and is completely engrossing from beginning to end.The most common criticism of this movie is that the narrative is not very strong, so it makes it difficult to get emotionally involved with the characters and the story. But, I don't think Coppola was concerned about that. Instead, it is obvious that the look and feel to the atmosphere of each scene was the most critical and key part of it all. Indeed, that is what looks the best so it is the best part of the movie. I do wish that the storyline would have been more clear because there were times when I was a little confused at what was happening and who exactly these people were. Nevertheless, the acting is strong enough to support the plot and the visuals accentuate it.As for the acting, the entire cast is excellent save one Keanu Reeves, who like many of his roles is so wooden and unemotional that he drains all the energy and feeling from his scenes. Putting him against a wild and charismatic actor like Gary Oldman or Anthony Hopkins hurts their performance and the scene. Still, the positives clearly outshine the negatives.The sets are incredibly detailed, the costumes are first-rate, the photography is dark and seductive and the music from Wojciech Kilar is among the most effective scores I have ever heard in a movie. It had its weaknesses, but it certainly affected me and I can imagine that was all Coppola needed to know this would be a success. Besides, compared to those Twilight supernatural creatures, this movie is astonishingly accurate and convincing.",8,1,3,9 December 2009
American Gangster," Ridley Scott is no Scorsese.
","Make no mistake, American Gangster is a very well-made, brutal and intense crime epic that covers the span of time under the rule of Frank Lucas, perhaps the first African-American to fully rule the drug underworld of New York City by himself without the support of another family. Still, all I could think while watching this was that it couldn't compare to The Godfather or Goodfellas. I'm sure Ridley Scott, a fine director in his own respect, wasn't trying to make a film comparable to those, but it still feels like the true story was put together in the same those were. The acting here is strong with Denzel Washington giving a calm, cool and calculating performance as Lucas, who perceives himself as more of a businessman than a drug dealer. Russell Crowe is also very good as a straight cop who has a terrible personal life but follows his job exactly by the book. The supporting characters are good and the cinematography perfectly captures the tough, gritty streets of New York and Newark during the 1970s. I did like this as an entertaining film, but in the end, it takes a course so similar to Goodfellas I couldn't believe it. I guess it did have to follow the way the real story occurred to be realistic, but it still copies the outline from a much better film. To be blunt, Ridley Scott is no Martin Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola, and despite all the good stuff from this, I prefer the much more stylistic directing of Scorsese or the powerful storytelling of Coppola.",7,0,3,16 July 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Will Ferrell will make you a believer.
","Of course everyone knows that Will Ferrell is funny; that is pretty much embedded on the DNA of every new born that comes into the world. What many may not know but will by seeing this movie is that Ferrell can act and play a straight role quite well. Here he plays Harold Crick, an IRS agent who has is complete daily routine down to a science. Everything from counting brush strokes while brushing teeth to timing his lunch break is completely and meticulously counted out and planned. Then, he begins to hear a voice from Emma Thompson who he finds out is narrating his life. With the help of a literary theory professor played by the iconic Dustin Hoffman, he discovers he is a character in her new book and that she is known for killing off the characters in all her books.To be perfectly honest with you, this is one of the stranger movies ever made but it is made so well and with such heart it doesn't feel as strange as it is. Unique is a word that comes to mind when thinking of the story and the script from first-timer Zach Helm is simple and straight and keeps the suspense all the while giving us insight into Harold's life and his rigorous schedule. As the story progresses, Harold's life begins to unwind and it is important to note that at the beginning his life feels less like a novel idea but at the end it is a great idea. Of course, none of this would be possible without tremendous acting and Ferrell holds it all together with perhaps his best performance yet. Hoffman and Thompson are two old pros here who know what they're doing and Maggie Gyllenhaal is so cute and likable here that it made me want to go look for her and her bakery. She gives what may be the film's best performance as Harold's love interest that has brains and spunk and rubs a little spice onto Harold's bland dish.She this if you can. It is rare to find a movie so unique and clever, yet with the feel of a typical audience-winner.",8,0,0,6 August 2008
The Green Mile," A powerful tale with gripping performances.
","Frank Darabont delivers again with his second adaptation of a Stephen King novel based in a prison. And while this version isn't as powerful nor moving as that first one that is considered today to be a masterpiece of modern cinema, the same elements involved bring together a warm sense of beauty and moving storytelling. This time, the story is told through the eyes of the guards, most specifically Paul Edgecomb, the head guard the death row block known as the 'Green Mile.' One day, a huge black man comes to death row accused of raping and murdering two young girls. As time goes on, everyone on the Green Mile begins to realize that this man and the case he is involved with are not what they seem to be.As with The Shawshank Redemption, the acting and writing are top-notch to give this film a great feel and powerful undertone. Tom Hanks is wonderful as Edgecomb, a man who has seen more than enough of death and sadness in his job but is forever changed when he encounters John Coffey. And it is this performance, by Michael Clarke Duncan, that sweeps you away and brings the most realism to the story. A humongous man with the spirit of a child, Duncan is completely believable and will move you to tears at some points. All other acting is phenomenal, including David Morse as Edgecomb's right-hand man, Barry Pepper as the young father who works there, Sam Rockwell as a very disturbing killer, and Michael Jeter as a lovable prisoner who gets the bitter end of his deal. And of course, Darabont delivers a great script with plenty of beautiful monologues that share the deep vision King's book does. The only weakness here is the obvious one; the running time being just over three hours. This is something very few films can pull off and this one doesn't. Still, for the most part it is moving and powerful and it boasts some of the finest performances you will ever see in a movie.",8,0,1,21 August 2008
Jaws," True horror.
","For all the 'horror' films that are released in Hollywood today, there really are none that can compare with Steven Spielberg's classic Jaws. Starting out as a pure horror tale about a killer shark terrorizing swimmers on the New England coast, it coasts through until we come face to face with the man-eating machine itself. The cast is terrific with Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfuss all giving one of the best performances in each of their distinguished careers. The real star, of course, is the shark, and Spielberg does a marvelous job of maintaining the suspense despite not seeing the shark at first. The film does have minor flaws, as it bogs down a little with too much footage of the shark hunt before quickly trying to cover back and make a strong finish, which it does. Nevertheless, this is true horror at its finest. It isn't particularly graphic, but some fantastic direction combined with John William's immortal score makes this one of the best films of the 1970s, of Spielberg's career, and of American cinema.",9,2,6,28 April 2008
The Wrestler," As tough and gritty as the subject it portrays.
","Wrestling has always seemed a bit of a bother to me with no real sense of direction or purpose whenever I accidentally catch a glance of it while flipping channels. Here, in Darren Aronofsky's powerful and effective film tribute, I can say with sincerity that I have grown to somewhat appreciate the sacrifice and dedication these guys go through, despite the shear ridiculousness of it all.In what is assuredly one of the finest performances of this or any other year, Mickey Rourke, the big, bold and intimidating actor best known for cheap bits in dirty and skanky low-budget flicks, breathes life into the body of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, an aging wrestler whose once-bright star from the 1980s flickered out some time ago. Yet, here he is, in the opening scene, in a grade school classroom slowly unwrapping is beat-up body for chicken feed. His personal life is just as dismal with the only real relationship he can experience being that with an over-the-hill, non committed stripper Cassidy, played with remarkable reflection and sincerity by the wonderful Marisa Tomei. She is ready to quit yet can't seem to truly walk away from a job that is thankless and depraving at the same time. The other strained but faint relationship is that with Randy and his estranged daughter Stephanie, in maybe the best performance by Evan Rachel Wood. She is a self-made young woman, completely ready to face the world on her own as she grew up that way. Then, her father comes back into her life and she is angry, confused and unsure of how to deal with this situation.To wrap this review up, I must conclude by saying that Mickey Rourke will win you over with this performance as will Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood. the intimate scenes are by far more gripping and intense than the wrestling scenes. These still are completely immersible and build for one great climactic moment. All in all this is a tough and gritty story about a tough and gritty man who lives for the thrill of the moment and has to reconcile with the fact that this may be done . Yes, it is a cliché story, but when it is so well-handled by Aronofsky and the three lead actors are mesmerizing, you can't help but be moved and astounded.",9,1,1,6 February 2009
Hancock," It isn't out to save the world...
","Hancock is not nearly as bad as it is being rampaged against. Certainly it is not able to measure up to Iron Man or Batman Begins in terms of great storytelling and eye-popping special effects. Yet, it has a simple and fun tone to it that makes it pure popcorn flick material that is altogether entertaining. Will Smith dominates the screen as the mysterious and all-powerful Hancock, a superhero who looks and acts like a normal person, yet can perform incredible feats. Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron give adequate performances as two people that have an important effect on Hancock's life. There is a major twist that comes about halfway through the story, and from there the film does get significantly weaker. Nevertheless, the story moves on crisply and we are always intrigued by what might happen next. So, I say give it a chance. You may not like it at all. But, if you are a fan of the superhero genre, this is a different take on the same type of story with some good acting and decent special effects. See it for what it is: a Will Smith vehicle with plenty of charisma and style.",7,0,1,13 July 2008
Inception," A dazzling, ever-turning journey that continues beyond the credits.
","In looking at Inception almost six months since its release, some answers develop while many questions remain. Having seen the film three times now, I must confess that I still don't completely understand every plot thread and story line. In fact, while learning more and understanding about threads I was unsure of previously, I now have other questions that didn't even cross my mind the first two times I watched it. Such is the nature of a very complex, multi-layered and challenging film.To say Inception is challenging is a gross understatement; what writer/director Christopher Nolan attempts to do with this story of dream thieves invading a man's subconscious to implant an idea is so far above and beyond nearly every other filmmaker working today that it should be admired strictly on that level. Indeed, right from the get-go we are thrust into this world where seemingly anything is possible. This atmosphere throws off the audience completely; we are now totally in the hands of Nolan and where he decides to take us.As the story progresses, we are given tight, helpful exposition that at times appears to simply pad the running time yet in the end is vitally important to understanding every aspect of what we have seen. With such a premise, Nolan is able to take wild fleets of fancy and his visual style has never been more perfectly realized than here. Each layer of the dream has its own distinct style, wisely constructed in a straight-forward and understandable manner. Some critique the film for not being strange or unpredictable enough, yet if it was could anyone understand it? In the end, what Inception offers to audiences is a challenging, thought-provoking journey that isn't just about a team trying to plant inception nor is it just about Dom Cobb's attempt to get to America to see his children. What Nolan is able to do on a subconscious and psychological level is pretty astounding; there are numerous elements and symbols most won't be able to see even after multiple viewings. To some this will not be entertaining or worthwhile. But there will always be a small niche in the market for those who go to the movies to see the art-form be stretched and expanded to its limits and potential. Nolan's film certainly does that and while it will easily distract and polarize many people, if one looks hard enough and with the right mindset, I believe one will see things and understand what Nolan wants us to glean from this, whatever that may be.",Null,0,8,7 January 2011
Lord of War," Brothers in arms.
","Nicolas Cage, without serious doubts as one of the finest actors of this generation, gives a very strong performance as a gun-happy salesman who trots the globe looking to supply anyone and everyone with all kinds of machinery for all reasons. In the film, we are introduced to him from his humble beginnings to his climactic rise as one of the top gun merchants in the world.The story does take a moral turn in many instances, especially with the character of his coke head younger brother played by Jared Leto, and his beautiful and unsuspecting wife played by Bridget Moynahan. Still, all morals aside, writer and director Andrew Niccol is not afraid to show all sides of this terribly bloody business and it helps the audience to really engage in the story. All points of Cage's character are discussed, including his relationships to family as well as the simple goal of staying alive in hostile territories. From the opening sequence of showing a bullet's complete life span to every scene of Cage scouring the globe for people to buy guns, Lord of War more than satisfies the crowd that wants to be entertained, as well as gives a good bit of food for thought on the very rational reasons to use or not use guns. Certainly worth checking out, if only for Cage's outstanding energetic performance as well as some great direction and action sequences. Definitely one of the best international thrillers of the decade.",9,0,1,12 December 2008
WALL·E," Pixar never ceases to amaze me.
","It all started back in 1995. I was only 6 years old, but I was forever changed when I first saw Toy Story. Today, it is one of my favorite movies as well as a breakthrough for all animated movies. Now, 13 years later, Pixar is still going at it. After all these years, I can honestly say they have never made a bad movie, and they have also made some really excellent movies that in the future will be absolute classics (Toy Story, The Incredibles, Ratatouille). Wall-E is undoubtedly the most ambitious task they have undertaken to date with a serious lack of dialogue and a story that has universal appeal. For the first half hour, the only sounds heard are those made by the robots. Yet, the story moves along just fine and it is quite easy to understand what is going on. This is due to the incredible storytelling ability by the Pixar team as well as the extraordinary animation you cannot look away from. Seriously, you will wonder if some shots are shot with a real camera they are so clear and beautiful. With robots being the main characters, it is a bit more difficult for the audience to relate to them, but director Andrew Stanton does a perfect job of personifying them as well as making them very likable. The romance between Wall E and EVE is very cheesy, but so well done you can't help but smile. Be aware, this movie is not just for children. Adults will be amazed by the animation as well as the thought-provoking themes brought up about the future and just how much humans should rely on technology. Elements of 2001 and I Am Legend aside, this is one of the top 5 Pixar movies and definitely one of the best movies of 2008.",9,2,4,3 July 2008
Stalag 17," Great suspense.
","After watching many Billy Wilder films, I expect him to excel in nearly every genre, except war films. Stalag 17 puts my doubts to rest. This is a great film, and one of the best war films ever made. Wiliam Holden is great fun to watch as the cynical, sarcastic, and clever Sgt. Sefton trying to find out who the mole in the barracks is after being accused of the title. Wilder pulls a genius move in never revealing if Sefton isn't the spy after all. He simply shows Sefton trying to blame someone else, and all we can do is sit and wonder if he really is a Nazi spy or someone else is. It all comes crashing down in the climax, and you will not be disappointed. The acting, directing, and of course writing are all terrific in this one-of-a-kind thriller that plays very well and very entertaining. This is one not to be missed.",9,3,5,8 February 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," Beautiful, uplifting and a triumph of a story.
","It is a well-known fact that The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most well-made and moving films in the past twenty years as well as in cinema history. It doesn't have the formula that fits most huge successes. It consists of almost two and a half hours of dialogue between many prisoners that carry on for nearly twenty years. To the majority of movie-goers, that is a recipe for boredom. However, for those who appreciate the medium of film as less than entertainment and more as enlightenment, this is the perfect example.In order to be so effective, this type of movie really only needs two very successful angles: the acting and the writing. Both are covered quite well. Morgan Freeman is terrific as Red as are all the supporting characters. However, it is Tim Robbins as Andy that sticks with me after the movie is done. Somehow, and Frank Darabont deserves credit as well for writing this character so thoroughly, Robbins is able to embody a kind, considerate yet gentle spirit into a man that is allegedly convicted of murdering two people. This alone is evidence to show he couldn't have done it. With this blessing, he is able to influence nearly everybody he comes into contact with, especially Red. Together, they form a bond most people only dream of. And this is what lies at the heart of The Shawshank Redemption. According to Andy, there is a feeling, and idea that drives a man to try and overcome all obstacles he faces and to not rest until he has done so. That would be hope, and with this Andy Dufresne is determined to come out on top.Simply put, this is a true piece of art as well as being on the best films of the 1990s and one of the best films ever made.",9,1,2,15 August 2008
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," The Virtue of Bemused Bewilderment
","Has Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu reinvented himself through Michael Keaton? The director of films known more for their universally- connected narratives, ensemble casts and flashy but suffocating visual styles has kept only the flash and instead gone small-scale and intimate. Yet, even in reinventing his narrative methods, he has still maintained certain personal elements that keep one from being able to pin down exactly what type of movie Birdman is. At times, you may feel as if you have the rest of the film figured out, only for Iñárritu to do a near-180 spin that leaves you thinking about why and whether or not it works. Then again, whether it works or not may be a moot point when it comes to this director.Every once in awhile, fate or some other external force graces film- goers with a pleasant experience by permitting circumstances to wed a particular actor with a particular role. Whether poetic justice comes into play is still to be determined, but few would be able to see the casting of Michael Keaton as a former blockbuster star attempting to reinvent his career on Broadway as anything but a marvelously innovative notion. Aside from noting the obvious imitations of art into life with Keaton's history as Batman, it is interesting to study how Keaton is able to unravel himself as an actor with more capabilities and dimensions than any of his previous roles have allowed him. He embraces age, the thinning hair exposing his round forehead, the facial hair sporadically spread over his face like vegetation in the desert. Aside from his brief tenure as the Dark Knight, Keaton has always seemed a marginalized actor; a familiar face but not noteworthy as a bona-fide star. This judgment no longer holds true.As much of a revelation as Keaton is, he may have the dubious misfortune to be in the same movie as Edward Norton, whose interpretation of a method actor incapable of leading any semblance of a real life without resorting to thespian techniques is an astonishing triumph. Norton has always been understood to be a massively talented actor who for whatever reason has kept his talent to a smaller pool of roles which, nevertheless, have become indelible for many since he burst onto the screen 18 years ago. In some ways, this role mirrors his own career in much the same way as Keaton's does. Still, nothing has prepared us for this kind of Norton intensity. He is at once vain, empathetic, sweet and cruel. Such a memorable performance can be undone, however, if the film's focus becomes distracted and we lose sight of a great supporting role, which seems to be the case here. The last 20 minutes become completely about Keaton, yet our interest in Mike Shiner has only increased, leading us to be incredulous as to the conclusion of his importance. What exactly was it supposed to be? And are we supposed to ignore these feelings while following Riggan Thomson down his path of enlightenment?If this sounds like criticism of the director's capabilities, it is more a questioning of his intentions. There can be little doubt regarding Iñárritu's talent as a director. Indeed, his ability to utilize the illusion of one continuous take throughout the whole film seems like a cheap gimmick at first, though eventually we become used to its effect, which is never overtly flashy or self- conscious. In many ways, you cannot help but be amazed at how much Iñárritu is able to fit into each frame, considering how often it fluctuates. Still, its actual effect will puzzle some viewers. What is its intended purpose other than to show off Iñárritu's ability as well as the intimate setting, in front and behind the curtain, of a Broadway play? Some have claimed it breaks down filmic barriers in order to bring the audience closer to the actors as they relate to their surroundings but the effect has little to do with its practicality. For all its technical prowess and intense acting, Birdman at its most bleakly poignant remains a well-tread tale of a man who put his career before family and relationships. Such themes add nothing new to the experience of watching the story of a man attempting to redeem himself but Iñárritu's methods are convincingly overwhelming. One critic described the film as 'vacuous virtuosity.' If ever there was a label for mixed feelings this would be it, and Birdman would be that movie.",Null,2,7,18 November 2014
Raging Bull," Such a film cannot be quantified,qualified or completely understood.
","Raging Bull has been viewed by countless people as the greatest American film of the 1980s, even of all time. Seeing it again, it is remarkable to see the precisely choreographed fight scenes, the powerful domestic scenes between Jake LaMotta and his wife and the overall arc of a life Scorsese brings to the screen. This is a film not easily forgotten.Without discussing the commonly known backstory and history of how Scorsese and De Niro came to make this film, it is important to discuss what Raging Bull targets in its remarkably moving film making. It all begins and ends with Robert De Niro's performance as LaMotta, a ferocious fighter with animal-like instincts that assisted in the boxing ring, but were deadly to his relationships. The most remarkable aspect of De Niro's acting here is how he is able to perfectly capture the pivotal point between LaMotta being sincere and being a bull. Even in scenes we know something harsh and violent is going to happen, the sheer low tone and calm gesture De Niro speaks in is enough to throw off the audience of the impending conflict. It truly is an unforgettable performance.Able to go face-to-face with De Niro is Joe Pesci as Jake's brother Joey, the brains of the operation and more able to deal with real life, as well as Cathy Moriarty as his blonde bombshell wife Vickie. The fact that she was a mere 19 years old during production enhances her performance even more.What Martin Scorsese is able to suggest not just about LaMotta but also humanity in general in a film some see merely as a sports film on par with Rocky or Bull Durham is unbelievable. This is not a sports movie, rather a careful character study of a man with infinite psychological and personal issues who attempted to approach every part of life as if it was a boxing match. When this didn't work with Vickie or his boxing representatives, he simply lashed out the only way he understood. Some see Jake LaMotta as almost entirely unsympathetic. I think he is even more sympathetic than most because he doesn't understand the sorrow and turmoil he causes. He acts but doesn't think.Scorsese, ever a master of the visual tricks and styles, so carefully photographed the fight scenes that they remain immersible in the viewer's head: this is real boxing compared to what is seen in other films. The fighters are completely covered in blood, sweat and water, while the slow-motion shots of certain characters forever marks their spot in our memories. This is a story told almost entirely from LaMotta's point of view, yet it isn't just his story. This is also Scorsese's, the story of a self-destructive man who alienated all of those around him only to lose that which he cherished. Fortunately for Scorsese, he realized his problems and perhaps making this film allowed him to escape a similar fate to LaMaotta.",Null,2,3,5 January 2011
Iron Man," Robert Downey Jr. is perfect.
","This is a comic book adaptation, and yet I really didn't care too much about Iron Man the superhero. This is what makes Iron Man such a great movie, not just a well-made action hero story. The character Tony Stark is one of the most fascinating in recent memory and Downey Jr. plays him with such humanity, wit and charm, you can't help but me mesmerized by him. His chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow will soon become legendary among superhero movies. The first time seeing it, I was impressed but not convinced. The second time around was much more enjoyable as I knew the story and concentrated on how well Jon Favreau paced the action, how good the acting was by all involved, and how well the music fit with each scene and added to it rather than being a distraction. This movies just works so well together, it makes for a great time in the dark. Certainly it is one of the best movies of the year so far, but it also introduces us to another world and another story that we all should get excited about: The Avengers.",9,1,2,26 June 2008
Ben-Hur," The best Bible epic.
","It is a sprawling achievement that captures your attention for all three and a half hours of its running time. In my opinion, it is a little too long, but it is nonetheless a magnificent work that saved MGM Studios while taking the life of producer Sam Zimbalist. Charlton Heston is perfect as the title role and the rest of the cast holds its own. William Wyler showed here why he is deserving of being mentioned with Welles, Hitchcock and Ford as one of the best directors during the Golden Age. For such a huge undertaking, he really held it together. See it for the chariot race scene with some brutal stunts. Bravo to all involved. They did Lew Wallace (and Christ) proud.",9,0,2,15 January 2008
Toy Story 3," Wondrous, beautiful and something to remember.
","From the looks of it, it seems Pixar will never go out of style nor will they make a mediocre or bad film. Once again, going back to that wonderful cast of characters we all love that includes the cowboy Woody, the spaceman Buzz Lightyear, as well as Jessie, Bullseye, Rex, Ham, Slinky and many more, Pixar doesn't just recycle old clichés and story lines. Rather, they use what they have already done and build upon that foundation to create a brand-new, exciting and fantastic adventure.Here we are, about 10 years after Toy Story 2 where we last left the toys saving Woody from being sold to Japan and adding a few new ones to the collection. Now, owner Andy is getting older and going away to college. The toys haven't changed, yet now begin to wonder what lies in their future. Will they be kept safe in the attic? Will they be donated and taken to a strange place? Or worse, will they be thrown out? What actually happens is so charming, fun, exciting and joyous to watch I can't even begin to spoil it for you. Let's just say that what follows consists of great jokes and sight-gags, beautifully animated set pieces and characters, and a huge amount of heart that practically no other animated film, or most films for that matter, can match.The animation is stunning of course, but the voice-over acting is really wonderful as well. Since most of them aren't huge stars themselves, we accept them completely as the characters they play. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are probably the only major stars of the cast, yet are just as captivating and emotionally-tugging to listen to as the supporting cast. And as always, what truly gets me in the end is the amount of heart and soul put into every production. As I sat there welling up at the beauty of the final sequence, I couldn't help but wonder in amazement at the originality and passion that so obviously had gone into the production. I guarantee this film will have a huge opening weekend and should have consistent staying power since it resonates so well with so many. That is the mark of true genius; that is the mark of Pixar.",10,4,6,18 June 2010
La Vie En Rose," Flawed, but still tremendous.
","La Vie en Rose tells the story of famous French singer Edith Piaf as she grew up. From living in a brothel, to singing in the streets for money, to finally fame and fortune as being considered 'the voice of Paris,' there is no doubt Piaf struggled and had a hard life. She used her phenomenal voice to convince others of her hardships and it was through her performance that people saw how she was able to overcome these obstacles. The film presents Piaf mostly in a sympathetic manner, but mostly the audience simply observes how she triumphs over life. Still, her life is not without pain as she struggles through losses and finally death. The acting is very good with Marion Cotillard giving a performance on the level of such like DeNiro's Jake LaMotta or Jim Carrey's Andy Kauffman. Completely embodying the character that was Piaf, Cotiilard gives an Oscar-nominee worthy performance. The other highlight is that of the makeup department. Their work is stunning and so important as we see Piaf in her final years in her mid forties but looking seventy. Overall, the film does merit some praise. The story flips between past and present too much to keep the audience fully interested, but it is still a great performance and one of the best films of 2007.",8,0,0,24 March 2008
Before Sunrise," Noble, romantic and full of life.
","Still holding up nearly twenty years later, Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise is a mesmerizing film documenting a day in the life of two people with vastly different backgrounds who form some sort of connection on a train and explore that connection in Vienna. Though some plot contrivance is required for certain scenes to take place, this is more or less one of the most thoroughly realistic and relatable love stories ever put on celluloid.The key to this success lays of course in the dialog and the acting. At times it is hard to believe much of this was written, though by whom is a matter of contention. It has been reported that actors Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke contributed significantly to this screenplay though remained uncredited. Whoever did write this script clearly has insight and understanding into the human condition regarding feelings of isolation, loneliness, love, parental relationships and overall outlooks on life. Seeing this film nearly twenty years after its release, one cannot help but think about the countless films which have been influenced by its charm, grace and idealistic view of the possibility of connections people can make. It is a noble and enthralling work, an experience that certainly becomes richer and more understandable through multiple viewings. Even in this post-post-modern society we inhabit, which seems to become increasingly cynical and technologically obsessed, here is a film that acknowledges the romantic in all of us; a desire to remain innocent, in love and fully aware of one's deep connection with another human being, preferably of the opposite gender.",Null,1,2,1 January 2013
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Psychoanalysis in sunny, beautiful Barcelona.
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a new kind of romantic film for Woody Allen, yet it still retains many of the classic Allen themes. It captures a certain kind of open-mindedness and tolerance that few people have but would surely want to have. Watching this film, I was never quite sure of what Woody was trying to say regarding the importance of artistic motivation in life or how it affects relationships and personalities. But then again, maybe there isn't much to say on the subject.Like nearly all of Woody Allen's movies, there is a deft blend of comedy and psychoanalysis in this story, though less comedy than I expected. What is really intriguing is how Allen sets up the plot, with best friends Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) each symbolizing the two aspects Woody sees as essential to the female. Vicky is the intellectual who devotes herself entirely to her studies and has puritanical and idealistic ideas about love and life. Cristina is the artist, open-minded and more aware of the possibilities life offers her than Vicky. Into their lives comes the brash and sensual painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), who shows a much different side than his horrifying performance in No Country for Old Men, at once both passionate and caring for each woman in his life.But the real fiery passion at the center of the story is Maria Elena, the ex-wife of Juan Antonio played with sexy charisma by the immaculate Penelope Cruz. She enters the story about 50 minutes in, yet immediately becomes the only thing we can look at. It is at this point that the plot slightly steers off course as we are led to believe that a polyamorous relationship would form almost immediately between three of the characters and the utopian effects it creates. Still, Allen crafts a beautiful and charming story set in the gorgeous, sunny Barcelona with stunning buildings, attractive people and a meditative tale about what happens when art and life collide, and the lasting effects it can have.",8,3,6,27 August 2010
Sweet and Lowdown," Withheld emotion.
","Sweet and Lowdown is the type of Woody Allen movie you wouldn't expect the legend to make, particularly after seeing a nasty and brutish piece like Deconstructing Harry. Yet, Allen shows his most gentle side here; by giving us two terrific and engaging characters, we are deeply engrossed in this fictional tale about a Depression-era jazz player who considers himself to be the best in the world, or at least the best next to Django Reinhardt.Emmet Ray is a fictional creation from Woody Allen's mind, but I find it fascinating how penetrating he is able to go in order to explore every facet of his character. Sean Penn is also able to bring forth the true feelings, or lack of feelings, Ray exhibits to nearly everyone he encounters. It is a great performance in a great career for Penn, and the same can be said for Samantha Morton who is brilliant as the mute Hattie who loves Emmet but is continually rejected by his lofty ideas of remaining completely detached.This film is a loose reworking of Fellini's classic film La Strada, which also tells the tale of a great artist (in this case a circus strongman) and his relationship with a mute girl who loves him unconditionally. Both films end similarly, and I think it isn't too far of a stretch to say that Allen's ending may hit even harder the emotions than Fellini. What Allen does here is gives us a very powerful and sad love story, effectively recreate the era of a time in America when resources were low but joy was high and plant a little sweetness and niceness into us for 90 minutes. The film looks great in its photography, sets and costumes and also has two enamoring performances by Penn and Morton. Whether a fan of Woody Allen or not, this is a film to see.",9,1,1,21 August 2010
The Sixth Sense," A lot can happen in 10 years.
","Ironically, I have viewed The Sixth Sense for the first time exactly 11 years after it opened. I remember distinctly when it was first released and the amount of buzz and tension it caused those who saw it. Unfortunately, I was not one of them but I am certainly glad that I have gotten to it now.In many ways, this has become a film of iconic proportions. Only saying the words, 'I see dead people,' gets a response out of most people. This film is also one of the reasons Bruce Willis is a star and the reason Haley Joel Osment is a household name. Beyond all that however, what it really comes down to is the potential shown by this film for a newcomer named M. Night Shyamalan, who might be today the most hated director in Hollywood. The reason for that is because he showed such talent and poise both in writing and directing and to see such marvelous talent go to waste on projects such as Lady in the Water, The Happening and The Last Airbender is the true disappointment.Without going into details, I must say to anyone who hasn't seen this film yet (and there are probably few), that this is filmmaking of the highest order. Shyamalan here shows impeccable timing and great ability to use editing, lighting and an incredible score by James Newton Howard to create true and genuine suspense and terror in multiple scenes. Knowing the major plot twist only because I have lived in America for the last ten years, I was still drawn into the story due to the emotional content involving Malcolm Crowe and his wife as well as the relationship between Cole and his mother. The most tantalizing scenes are when things happen to Cole and it is remarkable how Shyamalan stages and crafts each and every frame.So, ten years later we find Shyamalan with five more films under his belt with only two being well-received and the rest either panned or hated soon after. Is he still a talented filmmaker. I believe so but it is astonishing to see his descent since and one can't help but wonder what went wrong. I don't know but something did and I pray and hope that somehow, someway, Shyamalan will find his way back to the type of material and style he used to make this such a great film.",9,0,0,5 August 2010
Rear Window," A journey through the lens of a voyeur.
","We all have been on the receiving end of being a voyeur once in our life. There are times in our childhood, I am sure, when we spied on someone whether it was our parents, siblings or neighbors. As humans, we have the compelling feeling to be nosy and try to find out about business that is none of ours whatsoever. Alfred Hitchcock knew this feeling, so much so that he knew he could make a murder mystery out of it. Here, L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) represents all of us, unable to be satisfied with our own lives, so we pry into the lives of others. Unfortunately for him, he is also stuck with a cast for a broken leg, and is so bored with his current situation, he takes his overactive imagination and comes to the conclusion that one of his neighbors has committed murder.A set-up that has inspired many movies since then, Rear Window is one of the finest achievements of Hitchcock as well as an interesting and compelling thriller that really has more of a lack of thrills. But, like many Hitchcock films, it is the possibility of what might happen that keeps us in tune as well as the reason Jeffries stays involved. Nearly all of Hitchcock's heroes have an obsession, whether it is with a woman, clearing their name or trying to solve a murder, they do not let up but continue on until they either fail or succeed.I believe Hitchcock is also saying something about the balance of interest between our own lives and how much we should have in others. Jeffries is obsessed with bringing a possible murderer to justice, but he also tends to ignore those closest to him, his girlfriend Lisa (the beautiful and flawless Grace Kelly) as well as return to his job as a photographer. This voyeurism will put him in serious harm's way, but for him it is worth it to get some excitement into his life.As much as the story is interesting, so is the way it is told. Nearly all shots start out from Jeffrie's apartment, and there is tremendous detail paid to the characters that really don't have anything to do with the murder. Really, when you think about it, Hitchcock tells two stories here; the murder mystery and the lives of others amidst this hot and steamy week in New York. It is an eyeful and takes more than one viewing to get it all, but it is well-made enough that it is never boring and the last twenty minutes will still thrill you, even though you're being a voyeur.",9,1,3,22 May 2009
Casino," A long, indecipherable journey inside Las Vegas.
","In looking at Martin Scorsese's look at life in Las Vegas under control of the mob in the 1970s and 1980s, I became intensely curious as to what in particular Scorsese was trying to tell me. Was there any sort of outward message being presented in this sordid tale of greed, deception, backstabbing and violent behavior? And in the end, was this simply a spin off of Goodfellas? Many would disagree, claiming that Casino is an entirely different kind of Scorsese film, concerned more with the city of Vegas and its surroundings than anything else. Indeed, the first two hours fly by as Scorsese whisks us through the casino and its behind-the scenes facts. Long famous for the energy and spontaneity of his films, Scorsese's fluid camera snakes in and out of rooms, eavesdropping on the conversations of some of the highest and most powerful men in Las Vegas, some of which don't even live in Nevada. As in Goodfellas, there is innumerable amounts of information given. In fact, there are so many voice-over narrations going on one right after another, some may get dizzy trying to keep them all straight. All this, combined with fiercely intense performances from Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci make this a great two hour run. Unfortunately, this is a three-hour film.The last hour of the film, for me, bears many marks of Scorsese's labor of love for these settings and subject, yet it feels to drag on and on and on. Never have I seen one hour go by so slowly that was directed by such a great filmmaker. Indeed, the main reason for such slow pacing is the fact that practically the same thing happens in every single scene. For the first two hours, Scorsese sets up nearly ever character for some sort of payoff or consequence. Now, the payoffs must come. They do, one right after the other and it is not only boring to watch but also painful. As with any Scorsese film, the bleakness and desperation of the situation is not shied away from. It is difficult to watch the relationship between De Niro and Stone crumble, in effect mirroring the mob's relationship with Las Vegas fall apart. Nevertheless, by the end, I was left feeling somewhat unsatisfied and cold with all these characters. Not a single one can truly be empathized with, and in the end all get what they deserve.I know it is unfair to Scorsese to compare this film with Goodfellas, but there are so many parallels that it is hard not to. Where Goodfellas succeeded in having one main point of view narrate everything, here there are too many to consistently keep track of as well as too many scenes of people being beaten senseless and screaming at each other in drug-induced rages. I do not ask Scorsese to be gentler or sugarcoat his stories; I only ask that he create a solidly discernible plot flow throughout the film as he did in Goodfellas and The Age of Innocence. Regrettably, despite its many positive elements, Casino is not one of the great Scorsese's best.",Null,1,3,12 January 2011
Ran," 'Such is the human condition.'
","For Akira Kurosawa, without a doubt one of the greatest directors of all time, Ran marks the last great movie he ever made despite its shortcomings. It is hard to find fault with such a great director; one who has explored the very realistic nature of human living with classics such as Rashomon, Seven Samurai, Hidden Fortress, Yojimbo, and Red Beard. Here, he continues his love for Shakespeare by adapting King Lear to the samurai age as he shows an elder lord abdicate the throne to his eldest son only to watch it be tossed around amidst bloody and violent interactions.As with his other period pieces, Kurosawa pays attention to the little details and they all pay off and enhance the watching experience. Every scene is visually delicious from the remarkable sets and locations to the epic and colorful costumes and props. Kurosawa was also a master at filming action scenes and Ran is no exception. They battle scenes are rather graphic for Kurosawa but stunning nonetheless. Although this one didn't entice me as much as his earlier work, perhaps due to its slow-moving pacing and some rather complex motifs, this is still a very strong piece of work from the greatest of all Eastern directors and further shows that Akira Kurosawa is a director to be recognized and honored for all time.",8,1,3,2 January 2009
Pineapple Express," Not quite on the level.
","I'll be honest; I've only seen one Apatow comedy and that would be earlier this year with Forgetting Sarah Marshall. That was funny, raunchy and yet had a sweet romance to it and some interesting points on relationships. Here we have a stoner comedy with a lot of pot and a lot of violence all mixed together. Seth Rogen and James Franco play a buyer and a dealer respectively, who go on the run after Rogen witnesses a murder. All plot points aside, they end up in a huge drug war that made me think of what caused the aftermath in No Country for Old Men.To be honest, this wasn't my type of movie and for that reason alone I should not have gone to see it. Don't get me wrong, I laughed many times especially when Franco is talking about the beauty of his rare marijuana, Pineapple Express. Still, I cannot and will not condone the type of behavior that goes on in this story. It really all comes down to a bunch of crazy, greedy, stoned people who end up going at each other with guns. The first half is very high and the second half is very violent. These two don't mix very well and the result is rather distasteful. As good as Franco and Rogen are, I cannot recommend this due to its excessively violent nature and realistic tone. Yes, it's only a movie and should be treated as such. However, it feels so real you wonder if this actually happened or the characters were really high.",6,2,6,12 August 2008
Jackie Brown," The smartest ones don't always win out.
","After a ground-breaking, eye-opening success like Pulp Fiction, any director would feel pressured to make a film that establishes them as a genuine talent rather than a flash in the pan. I'm not sure that is what Quentin Tarantino attempted to do with Jackie Brown, but he makes it work in every way possible. As his only film not originally written but based on an Elmore Leonard novel, the film has a very novel-like structure. There are also quite a bit of main players, to a degree even more so than Pulp Fiction because here they are part of the intricate and complex plot rather than supporting characters thrown in for some enjoyable banter.It is interesting to see the evolution of Tarantino's ability to direct a film between Pulp Fiction and this. One feels like a young, up and coming director full of ambition and energy, ready to show the world what he can do. The other is much more restrained, professional and interested in the deeper realms of these characters. Indeed, throughout his career it is obvious that Tarantino's gifts lie with dialogue and characters; for him they go hand-in-hand.To go along with that is a terrific cast. Pam Grier, an icon of the blaxploitation films of the 1970s, looks tired and weary of the cards life has dealt her as the title character, a flight attendant who gets mixed up with smuggling money and the ATF, putting her in a position she would rather not be in but understands the long-term significance. Samuel L. Jackson gives perhaps the best performance as Odell, a mean, driven criminal willing to go to any lengths to ensure his status. Robert Forster revived his career as Max Cherry, a bail bondsman with a lot in common with Jackie and willing to help her out. However, my personal favorite must be the great Robert De Niro as Louis, a former cell mate of Odell who is more than a little unable to work his way back into society after being released from prison. The way De Niro plays the character so subtly stupid and ignorant is both hilarious and shocking to watch.Of course, with any Tarantino film, the plot doesn't matter so much as who's in it. The film is long but never boring as he winds up this intricate story of crossing and double-crossing all while sneaking in scenes contemplating heavier themes like age and life's direction. This is certainly a film that will catch people by surprise, especially Tarantino fans who loved Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The classic Tarantino signs are here, but there's also a lot more under the surface.",9,1,1,10 December 2010
Inside Llewyn Davis," Llewyn's The Odyssey
","After finding the greatest mass-culture success and reaction with their searing, post-modern Western No Country for Old Men, the Coen brothers seem to have been on a journey throughout their last four films. As always flouting the expectations of audiences and studios, they went at the pace and direction in which they felt most comfortable. This resulted in a high-energy, excitingly quirky and sometimes violent comedy; a most studious portrayal of a man in 1967 struggling with the greatest Jewish questions; and a straight-on genre piece made with the finest touch of cinematic craftsmanship available. Do any of these projects have a connection? At their basest, one could surmise they all are about the characters' intentions of finding home. This, of course, is a word used so often as to be overstated, yet the meaning has become so varied it can apply to almost anyone and anywhere. Now, the Coens go to a spiritual home of sorts for so many cultural figures in the early 1960s: Greenwich Village.Intentionally set just before one young man from Minnesota came to New York and shook the whole scene out of its self-conscious doldrums, the story follows the titular character floating amongst acquaintances, sympathizers and fellow musicians as he attempts to put together his own career after a tragic loss. As has been noted, this is a great set-up for the cliché rags-to-riches story, yet the Coens are far too intelligent and savvy for that. They said they began writing the screenplay with the image of folk singer Dave Van Ronk being beaten outside the Gaslight Cafe after a concert, which is what happens to Llewyn Davis. He receives just about everything a down-on-his-luck artist could: physical and emotional beatings which leave him alienated from just about everyone. In most other stories of this kind, this would provide the artist with the perfect opportunity to dig deep within himself and find exactly what was missing previously from his output, resulting in the breakthrough success he was searching for all along. Yet, Llewyn's problems either go too deep or he is in the wrong business at the wrong time. Like all their films, the Coens show a masterful ability to synthesize exquisite imagery, eccentrically memorable supporting roles and a bleakness that worms its way into your soul. Here, the bleakness comes out the complexity Llewyn Davis gives to the audience. Never ones to make a statement about how we should feel about their characters, Llewyn might be the Coens' fullest and most thriving creation on their resume. A bile-filled, slightly narcissistic, handsome rogue, Oscar Isaac plays him as almost upset by his own actions yet perhaps unable to stop himself from self-destructing. Trying to apologize to an ex-girlfriend, attempting to dine with intellectual supporters, even preparing to perform for a seemingly generous audience; all these instances are pure examples of Llewyn Davis' astonishing ability to screw himself over. He knows the consequences of his actions as soon as he says or does whatever it is, yet there is not necessarily a lack of sympathy for this man. He is an artist, struggling to find not only his voice but his purpose in finding his voice. Should this life-changing decision he has made be a defining time in his life, or is he still drifting, forever doomed to be unattached and undefined?Other supporting roles are almost as superb as Isaac. Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake as a performing duo who reluctantly help Llewyn out in various ways; Ethan Phillips and Robin Bartlett as the academic couple who think they are helping Llewyn by treating him as fodder entertainment for their friends; and John Goodman as a corpulent, slightly sinister jazz musician who reminds one of Robert DeNiro in Angel Heart. His condescension and constant put-downs of both Llewyn and the folk scene express many peoples' feelings as well as perhaps Llewyn's self-hatred of what he has become. Constantly on the outside looking in, folk music was at this time struggling to maintain its existence amidst the Red Scare but also the up-and-coming rock and roll scene burgeoning throughout the United States. Traditionally, Bob Dylan has been hailed as the savior of this genre, yet just like the concept of home this may be overstated. In the end, with a new figure emerging on the scene effectively rendering him obsolete, what may be most important for Llewyn is the future, rather than the present. His ex tells him he has no concept of the future and he counters by telling her she has no concept of the present. Perhaps they are both right about one another, but as it turns out, which side of this argument would it be worse for Llewyn to come out on? Presumably, the struggle maintains itself for as long as he tries to express it through music. For him, home may be just a five-letter word.",Null,3,6,14 January 2014
Sin City," Amazing to look at.
","Really, I have to congratulate Robert Rodriguez on a fantastic job of bringing a graphic novel to the screen exactly as it is on paper. This is not a new idea, but Rodriguez does a masterful job of giving this film the look of the novel, not just the feel. By shooting only on digital film, the entire movie looks like a graphic novel brought to life, which is what it is. The acting is very good, especially by Clive Owen and Bruce Willis, who I think does the finest job as the honest but doomed cop Hartigan. For the most part, this film keeps your attention, but I felt that some of the stories lacked real depth. Of course, we can't blame Rodriguez for that as he is making a direct adaptation. Still, this is film is amazing to look at. Combined with the high-quality star power, the crazy, blood-filled action of the action sequences, and the best scene in the film directed by Quentin Tarantino, all this adds up to a crazy thrill ride that does not let go.",7,0,1,6 May 2008
Saboteur," Foreshadowing the future.
","A man is wrongfully accused of killing his friend in an aircraft plant fire, and must travel cross-country to avoid the police and discover the true sinister nature of the situation at hand. A plot line that was later used to fuel Hitchcock's classic North by Northwest, Saboteur benefits from some very good performances as well as some masterful suspense sequences from the Master himself.For any Hitchcock fan, the plot is a bit too familiar, but he was always able to infuse the story with its own memorable supporting characters and charades. Here, the likable and charming Robert Cummings is the lead and soon finds himself visiting many strange and quirky characters, not withstanding a troupe of circus performers, a rich businessman with hidden motives, and a blind loner who shows him the best way to judge someone.In terms of sheer originality and quality, this does lack in some areas, particularly the motive of the antagonists. However, there is some nice chemistry between Cummings and his lead lady, the much under-appreciated Priscilla Lane as well as a truly moving performance as the blind man by Vaughn Glaser. The best part is the final sequence, which perfectly mirrors what Hitchcock would use later in North by Northwest, only this time the climax is atop a statue in New York. Certainly not his best, but the Master of Suspense gives us some great moments to wait for.",8,2,3,8 May 2009
Gangs of New York," The rich, violent, turbulent history of America.
","Despite some of its flaws, few films are as relevant to these times as Martin Scorsese's historical epic of the birth of modern America, Gangs of New York. At a time when politicians are attempting to reform the immigration policy, this look at a time when all races and groups had some form of antagonism against all other races and groups is very much a testament to the roots of our making this country great.In looking at this film, there is little doubt that this is one of Scorsese's best and most brilliantly told films from a technical and visual standpoint. Never before, and perhaps never again, has a director put forth such great effort to preserve as much as possible about the details and minute elements that made up life in New York circa 1863. The sets are astonishingly realistic, the costumes first-rate, the extras well-placed and effective. If nothing else, Scorsese has crafted here perhaps the most exquisitely beautiful and bold portrait of American life in the 19th century.Yet, other elements work just as well. The acting is very fine with Leonardo DiCaprio giving a rousing performance as Amsterdam, son of a slain gang leader returning to avenge his father's death. His nemesis is Bill the Butcher, played with delightful evil by the great Daniel Day-Lewis, a method actor with more than enough determination and diligence to completely embody his character. He is the most flashy and noticeable performer, overshadowing nearly everyone but all credential he received were well-deserved. However, perhaps Cameron Diaz is a bit miscast here, too pretty-faced and valley girl to rightly portray a pickpocketing, street-tough woman.In all, Scorsese has put together some of the finest technical work he has ever done, his camera never more fluid or bold, the editing crisp and smooth, the cinematography wide and fresh. Yet, at the screenplay level some serious flaws remain, notably at the conclusion. Without giving anything away, one comes away feeling as if the ending was anti-climactic, and the way Scorsese built it all up makes it feel like a real cheat. At times, the story does lag a bit, focusing on characters and subplots not necessary to the main focus on Amsterdam and Bill. Still, in spite of these shortcomings, this is one of Scorsese's more underrated works. It dazzles the eyes and speaks to the heart. This is our history as Americans. The idea is to learn from it so as not to repeat it. That is the message for today, tomorrow and future generations to come.",Null,0,0,14 January 2011
Her," Hello, is there anybody in there?
","One of the most debatable elements about Spike Jonze's poetic, melancholy ode to the nature of love and human relationships is whether or not Samantha, the operating system (OS) which becomes the object of the protagonist's affection is truly real or illusory. Indeed, using the word 'which' seems to imply my stance that she is not. After all, if I thought so I would have said 'who.' Nevertheless, this simply goes to show how the ideas the film presents can become so deeply entrenched within our own conscious, causing us to wonder not necessarily at the plausibility of this scenario but rather the consequences it would have on the human race collectively.Jonze has always been seen as a hippsterish outsider of sorts. Part indie, part surrealist poet, his three features prior show a firm handle on the technological aspects as well as a creative mind pulsating with potentialities. Writing solely for the first time, he creates a mesmerizing tale of people in the future where it's not the clothes or hairstyles or city architecture that should worry us; it's the lack of true, meaningful interpersonal connections. Indeed, it is not just Theodore who falls for his computer's OS. Is this a satirical point or a reluctant admittance? Either way, everyone knows society is headed in this direction. The only question which remains is what would it be like to have this kind of connection with an entity largely understood as impersonal? It may be an impossible question to fully answer, but based on Joaquin Phoenix's performance, we can at least attempt an educated guess. Never one to shy away from fully involving himself in a character, here he plays a kind one would think he never could: warm, romantic, almost feminine. His thick-wired glasses and curvaceous mustache cannot hide the deep-seated emotions he exhibits throughout. Pain, bewilderment, ecstasy are all prevalent in his face, which is the main subject of the camera, and proves once again Ingmar Bergman's famous statement that the human face is the most important subject of cinema. Just as effective is Amy Adams with a hairstyle like Cameron Diaz's in Being John Malkovich. Yet, most surprising is the voice work of Scarlett Johansson. It may have been a Catch-22 to use a voice most people recognize which is automatically attached to such a physically attractive figure, but, thanks in large part to Phoenix's reactions, it works. Her voice, here a grand mixture of breathy Marilyn Monroe and husky Candace Bergen, captures the true soul of this film. Johansson's Samantha is energetic, childish, exceedingly bright and always ready for fun. Most audiences may simply insert her face mentally whenever she speaks but she brings to the story a level of gravitas and sadness perhaps no other actress could have.So, is Samantha real or illusory? Perhaps the real issue is whether or not her feelings towards Theodore are honest. As it turns out, the most important aspect of love may be the nature of exclusivity. Being alone with someone else, physically or aurally, has to be one of the most universal feelings humans share. Perhaps, as Jonze shows us, technology will someday reach that level, and even surpass it, as well.",Null,2,4,15 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Best. Film. of. 2008. Period.
","Without a doubt, no other film of 2008 will be able to title itself as the very best of the calendar year. Certainly, this is a subjective question, but after experiencing this wondrous achievement, I can't imagine anyone picking another film but this as best picture of 2008.

The Breakfast Club," An ageless film that transcends all generations.
","Of all of John Hughes' classic films of the 1980s about teenagers, The Breakfast Club is the most famous, the most sympathetic and the most endearing. It also is the film that has defined a generation of young people who were growing up in a time where they truly didn't feel that they belonged in any one category but now as they are probably in their 30s or 40s I am sure they can look back on their teen years as better than they thought.The setup is well-known: five kids with nothing in common, all from different points on the society scale stuck in detention on a Saturday who come to realize that there is more than just stereotypes in the room with them. The other four are people, people who hurt and have feelings and friends and parents they have problems with as well as a domineering principal they cannot relate to. These common bonds are doors, opening to show them the truth not just about each other but about teenagers in general and the true difficulties they all face.As mentioned before, of all of John Hughes' films, this is the most serious as well as endearing towards its characters. Hughes wisely doesn't talk down to them but puts them all on an equal plane, which forces them to look past the outside caricatures and see the person inside. The acting then brings this out fully, with Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez and Anthony Michael Hall giving perhaps the best performances of their careers all in this one movie. The performance that sticks out most to me, though, is Judd Nelson as the criminal-mind John Bender. He is the most outrageous, so he breaks the ice between them and really starts the ball rolling. He kind of takes a back seat in the narrative in the third part, but still gives the best performance , one that I think is Oscar-worthy and truly captures the anger and frustration someone in his situation would be feeling constantly.There are times when it can be hard to watch as these five break down the walls that separate them, but it is all worth it in the end. Not just a classic teen film but also one of the best of the decade, The Breakfast Club still applies today to teenagers who feel out-of-place or misled in their lives. That is the film's greatest achievement: it is an ageless story that transcends all generations and speaks to each of us no matter who or where.",9,0,1,17 April 2009
The Social Network," Just a speeding ticket.
","Rarely does a film come along that poses important issues and ideas about what it means to live as a human being. Even more rare is a film that truly gets to the issues at hand; what is happening to us right now in these modern times. The Social Network is such a rare film.Everyone with a computer knows about Facebook. In less than five years, it has gone on to become the latest and most fashionable way to keep in touch with people you either know, don't know or would secretly like to know. It is the ultimate source of knowledge about people; whoever doing whatever whenever. Because this is such a permeating idea, the decision to release the film only six years after the website was launched is indeed brilliant. Then again, so is the film itself.With a film based on computer programming and website building, in order for the vast majority of people to be drawn in, the screenplay must be exceptional. Aaron Sorkin's is such. Each and every character has that unique brand of speaking he has used in dozens of scripts: the dialogue is suave and intelligent, the delivery is snide and sarcastic. There is so much talking crammed into this two hour film that most people will be amazed they sat through a film like so. Yet, with the acting and directing, this is hardly a chore.In the acting department, all are sublime and elegant in their respective performances. From Armie Hammer as the Winklevoss twins to Andrew Garfield as co-founder Eduardo Saverin, not one actor misses a beat or step. Everyone is remarkably on track in keeping within the confines of the story. Of course, the characters with the most face time are the ones everyone will remember and everyone needs to remember Justin Timberlake and Jesse Eisenberg come Oscar time. Both are magnificent in their respectful performances, portraying two men of opposite personalities but similar goals.However, David Fincher must be given most of the credit for the sheer intensity and brilliance of the overall structure and experience of this film. In the end, it doesn't matter what actually happened or what is accurate. Being a fictionalized interpretation of the facts, Fincher creates with his slick editing, low-lit scenery and smooth camera-work an intelligent and marvelously well-sculpted piece of filmmaking that will be remembered for a very long time.The final issue that must be addressed is the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook and the youngest billionaire in the world. Some, including Mark, think it's a bit harsh on him, seeing him as a totalitarian and ruthless businessman with no heart or sentiment. I would argue that it actually is very sympathetic to the Zuckerberg character and the real villain of this story is Sean Parker, who lured Zuckerberg away from his friends and supporters with the sensational dreams of changing the world. He's already done that and there's no telling what Facebook will turn into next. Of course, we'll all know about it. Just check your Facebook.",10,2,5,1 October 2010
Goodfellas," Crime pays in more ways than one.
","Goodfellas is an exhilarating, nonstop joyride depicting the rise and fall into decadence of a small group of mobsters with enough determination and confidence to succeed anywhere. Fortunately for them, once they get to the top of the mafia in the 1960s and 1970s, the idea of staying at the top became regular: why think about falling when no one can touch you? Such is the mind-frame one must take into screening Goodfellas.In his long, storied and brilliant career, this might be Scorsese's most technically sound and polished work. By this time, Scorsese had perfectly built his own, unique style of shooting and in this case, the material supported the visuals completely. Known for such gangster, hard-nosed films that he made in the 1970s and early 1980s, Scorsese put his talents to great use once again to create and updated portrait of the American dream as witnessed and developed by the very people who began its genesis.With his fluid and straightforward style, Scorsese gives so much information about the ins and outs of running and be part of a mafia clan that by the end, the audience is more than well-informed. The voice-over by Ray Liotta is utilized in the most effective way. This is his story; flashbacks, freeze frames and other camera tricks are all used to emphasize and translate what needs to be said. There is also the constant energy of the film. Nearly every scene has a raucous feeling, as if these characters are living their lives to the fullest every night with no care for tomorrow. We get to know and understand these characters so well that when their ultimate fate is revealed, we are at once surprised, appalled, and satisfied.In the end, what is important to remember while watching this masterpiece, and what will always stand out, is the phenomenal performances of Robert De Niro, Liotta, Lorraine Bracco and especially Joe Pesci as the incredibly volatile hit-man Tommy De Vito. Also memorable is Scorsese's use of the camera along with his dynamic soundtrack of the era and the sharp, effective editing with his legendary collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker. In the years to come, this may be the film Scorsese will always be remembered for. It is an American tale of what this country and a life of crime have to offer as well as all the consequences that follow.",Null,0,0,10 January 2011
The Birds," Wings of desire.
","Certainly one of the stranger movies of his career, Alfred Hitchcock nevertheless is able to astound and amaze use even forty years after the release of this story of horrific occurrences in a small bay side town involving fine-feather friends.What makes this a memorable experience despite its shortcomings, is how Hitchcock never explains to us the reason behind the birds. They attack but essentially there is no logical or natural reason to understand this. Perhaps it is supernatural, but that also is never examined. What Hitchcock wants to do is put ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances and study how they behave. He did this in Psycho, North by Northwest, and Vertigo which are three of his personal best as well as three of the best films ever made. Here, he uses elements from those films and creates a rather dizzying portrait of a small group of people trying to band together and fight against whatever nature brings them.I'm not quite sure what Hitchcock is trying to say here. Perhaps he is saying that sometimes nature will impose its will on us and we shouldn't try and fight it. Or maybe he is suggesting we do fight back. However, I think that is besides the point as this is yet again a huge step forward for movies from the 1960s. Hitchcock insisted on using the ground-breaking technique from Disney to combine two different backgrounds and foregrounds to create shots that seem to be together but really weren't. Even today, this stands as some of the finest examples in special effects. Some elements of the story don't work as well as his other movies, but this is an enjoyable and strangely mesmerizing tale of scary things happening in a place you wouldn't expect by creatures you wouldn't expect. Next time, cover your head when you go outside.",8,1,2,2 June 2009
Jurassic Park," A well-made thrill ride with dinosaurs.
","Of course they were going to make a movie based one this book, and of course Steven Spielberg, the king of the box office, was going to direct it. It did happen and the result is a spectacular vision of what dinosaurs really might have looked like when they lived on Earth. Of course, with Spielberg at the helm and ILM doing the special effects, everything here looks stunning, even by today's standards. The action sequences are very well-shot and the suspense hangs over us for the better part of the second half of the movie. The biggest flaw here is the human characters. They aren't developed nearly as much as they should be and only the Jeff Goldblum character is interesting at all. Still, we really aren't supposed to get close to these characters, just sit back and watch dinosaurs try to kill them. For film nerds, there is plenty to dissect and critique. For the average movie lover, this is simply a well-made thrill ride.. with dinosaurs.",8,5,10,15 May 2008
The Wizard of Oz," Truly, 'There's no place like home.'
","I just saw this film last night for the first time in my life. I have to say that it was a wonderful experience and I am certainly going to buy it. The whole production was perfect: the screenplay, the directing, even the special effects still look somewhat cool even though they could make them way more realistic today. However, it would be very wrong to remake this film. Its very much like 'Casablanca', or 'Citizen Kane'. You can't remake them because they are perfect as is. All of the elements needed to make a good film came together here and the result is one of the best and most popular films of all time. Truly, there is no place like home.",9,2,3,28 March 2006
Up in the Air," The story of life up in the air.
","Jason Reitman's third feature is the most personal-feeling of the three and perhaps the best. After exploring the life of a tobacco lobbyist and a quirky pregnant 16 year-old, Reitman turns to a more global issue and one every human can relate to: employment. At first attempting to make a film on the booming economy earlier this decade, the tone changed completely and now this is a downward, somewhat depressed and bitter look at the situation we face as Americans today; more relevant now than ever before.George Clooney gives the performance of his career, even better than his offers from Michael Clayton and Syriana. He portrays Ryan Bingham, whose job is to tell others that their working days are over. He travels for a good 2/3 out of the year and is never more happy than when he is on a plane, going through safety inspections or walking through the airport. He knows all the rules and ways to sidestep and save time, travels lighter than most ever will and has all of life in perfect order. His life is turned upside down when his no-nonsense boss (Jason Bateman) announces that a young, perky up and coming employee has created an idea to do their job over the Internet and with computers. Played by Anna Kendrick with fierce tenacity and focused determination, she is taken on the road with Ryan to be shown the ropes of how this job is done; and there are definite rules on these things.What is so interesting about this movie is the way in which co-writer/director Reitman so easily and fluidly weaves together the alleged comedy and the unmistakable sadness and bitterness. There are scenes in which we chuckle or maybe laugh out loud at a one-liner, but then there are heart-wrenching scenes of people getting laid off and no one cannot feel sorry for each and every single person. It isn't important to know what they did or who they are; simply that they had a job and now they are gently being shoved out the door.To counter these scenes we get the more personal story of Ryan's life, which basically consists of his suitcase, its belongings and traveling until he comes across a woman who shares his interests and his lifestyle; Alex played with incredible charm and class by the lovely Vera Farmiga. Together, they laugh, hang out and basically try to hang onto one another amidst the turmoil all around them. Ryan's relationship with his young protégé, Natalie, is also intriguing because he at first despises her idea since it undercuts his lifestyle, but soon he warms up to her and sees beneath the rough exterior someone who is still very much afraid that her life is over before it began.There are also scenes with Ryan's two sisters; the only family he has and seems even cold to them. However, with a little push from Alex and Natalie, he starts to realize that perhaps he has missed something important this whole time and needs to get involved now more than ever.Beneath the cynicism of America's current economic status, there appears a glimmer of hope but it is not pushed to the forefront like so many other movies. Rather, Reitman lets sit there and lets us see the whole picture. The acting brings everything into focus with Clooney showing a reserved, relaxed man with all the answers but also a side of vulnerability he never knew he had about his job and the way things work. Farmiga is eager and able to go toe-to-toe with him and Kendrick needs to get away from those awful Twilight films because this role shows she has real potential to be a real actress. And Reitman's screenplay covers a lot of ground and material, but never too much and sheds just enough light on everything so we catch it all but aren't overwhelmed.If nothing else, this is certainly one of the best films of 2009. It further shows Reitman's ability to find humor in the saddest and strangest ways and does it with such class and distinction. Perhaps what this is saying is what the people who were fired had in common was that there was someone in their life with them to take the impact. I had a somewhat drab feeling after leaving the theater but I realize that it wasn't because the movie was sad so much that it was right.",10,2,7,23 December 2009
Atonement," Good, but doesn't belong with the best.
","I must admit, after all I heard from the critics about Atonement not being one of the best films of 2007, I didn't watch it expecting to be one. Nevertheless, I felt it was better than given credit for all the way around. The look is very good, especially in the first third set in the gigantic house of the Tallis' in England. However, as the mood of the film transposes, so does the quality of it. The young daughter, Briony, falsely accuses her older sister's lover of attacking her sister. This leads to serious conflict as well as the separation of the star-crossed lovers, Robbie and Cecilia. As the years go on, Briony becomes more and more guilty of what she did and Robbie fights in the war, facing death at every corner. The ending and the build-up to it is very well executed, as is most of the film. The sets and costumes are gorgeous, the acting is solid, and the writing is clever in many regards. However, what keeps Atonement from No Country or There Will Be Blood greatness is the lack of depth to the characters, especially the central ones of Robbie and Cecilia. We never really get to know about their relationship and it doesn't make for a great payoff at the end. The film is still very well-made and doesn't falter too badly, but the lagging in the middle and lack of character depth keeps it from being Best Picture-worthy and one of the best films of a very strong 2007.",8,1,1,15 June 2008
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Looking for logic where there is none.
","There is a line in O Brother, Where Art Thou? that sums up not just the consensus view of this movie, but also that of nearly every Coen Brothers production. George Clooney says to his chained counterpart John Turturro, 'It's a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart.' Indeed, there may never have been a better and more meaningful statement uttered. For that sums up the total outlook Joel and Ethan have given to us ever since their stunning debut in 1984 with Blood Simple.Although this is not a new concept for them, I think these themes work really well with the setting of this movie, one of the most original in remembrance. Here, we get the story of Homer's The Odyssey set in the 1930s of the American South as three bumbling ex-cons search for a treasure while encountering many obstacles along the way. However, like many a Coen Brothers movie, the plot is just a spot to hang up the arc of the story in order to give way for the really interesting aspects; here being the idiosyncrasies of the characters, the gorgeous wide-screen photography, and the overall crass view of human existence.Through all this, there is a great amount of fun and joy in this story. Clooney is the fast-talking, slick leader of this weirdly likable trio and despite many believing he is too good looking and polished for the role, I believe that only adds to his repertoire, for this Everett needs to be a fast-talker in order to be taken serious because of his looks. Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson add comic support but also depth with their portrayals of Pete and Delmar, chained to Everett and loyal followers the whole way. Even with the clever writing and shifty characters, there is something of a heart behind this story as well as the typical cynicism of the Coens.This is certainly the type of movie that grows on you and multiple viewings are needed not necessarily to understand the plot but to capture the tone and message of the movie; if there is one. Still, if nothing else, one can certainly appreciate the intelligent/stupid mixture of humor the Coens are capable of mixing together so well. Clooney, Turturro and Nelson are wonderful in their respectable roles and of course, Roger Deakins perfectly captures the feeling of the old South with his colorful and rich cinematography. Here is a great looking, fast talking, clever movie with not much of a message. With the Coens in charge, what is the problem?",7,2,2,29 December 2009
The Godfather," A view from the other side of life.
","The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones.",10,6,10,17 November 2009
