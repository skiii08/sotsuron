Chinatown," Great acting by Nicholson

Closer," Creative concept
","I watched it as part of the reco from Natalie's masterclass.Due to 4 strong characters, none went deep enough for me to feel for them. Esp, Julia's character could be more fleshed out. Concept was creative as well as the end.",7,0,0,29 June 2019
