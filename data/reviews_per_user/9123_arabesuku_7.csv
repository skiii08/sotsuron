The Blair Witch Project," A historical landmark of low-budget film making and horror cinema.
","A lot of people have criticized this for not being scary, but on the contrary I think it was very scary and I admire this film for creating an entire new meaning of 'scary' and for being so successful on such a low budget. Universal's coffee bill must be higher than what the budget was for this film. I feel that this was the birth of the psychological horror film.What also helped this was the fact that the actors used their real names in the film, and the website that accompanied it helped to create the illusion that this incident portrayed in the film was a true event.Fabulous acting (and REAL snot coming out of Heather Donahue's nose in that heartbreaking famous scene), great shots and eerie locations also help to boost the scariness of TBWP.Definitely a film you must see before you die.10/10.",10,2,4,25 September 2007
Madagascar," Likable
","This film had it's good and bad parts. On one hand, the plot was predictable, the jokes not particularly funny and the speed of the characters movement gave me a headache (they constantly run around and jump and dance). I did like the characters, although they weren't anything new or interesting. David Schwimmer (as the giraffe) made me laugh, but mainly because I could compare the personality of the giraffe to that of Schwimmer's character Ross in the TV show Friends - both a bit paranoid and very cautious at all times. Ali G (as the lemur king) made me giggle as well when he danced, and I particularly liked the 'wackiness' of his character. The penguins were probably the most enjoyable characters on the film - they were 'psychotic' (as the lion Alex liked to call them) and I found them very entertaining to watch. The animation in this film was very well done. I noticed in particular the perfection on the water effects (eg by the sea in Madagascar or in Gloria's swimming pool) and Alex's mane (how it moves when he does). I would say this film is enjoyable. It isn't anything new or fantastic, but it did have small moments where it made you smile or laugh. Otherwise it got a bit predictable really. My advice - see if you liked Shrek. But don't expect too much - the trailers make it look better than it is!",6,0,0,19 July 2005
Resident Evil: Extinction," This should have been rated '18'.
","This movie was a lot better than I expected. Claire Redfield joining the crew, another stunning performance from Jovovich and the strangest twists and biggest explosions the series has seen yet.However - this should have been rated an '18' rather than a '15' in the UK.It was very gory and very disturbing - the undead so far were not too scary for me but this was more gory and disturbing than the Dawn of the Dead remake and it frightened the hell out of me.A good movie - but be warned.8/10.",8,0,3,2 November 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Stunning, poetic, brutal - ELdF packs a hell of a punch.
","El Laberinto del Fauno is a faerie-tale in a terrible world. Set in post-Civil War Spain, bookworm Ofelia is living in a tragedy with her increasingly ill and pregnant mother and her stepfather, the cruel and sadistic Captain Vidal. The family is moved to a mill (where Vidal is stationed) and it is there that Ofelia meets her destiny, and the opportunity for something better. She is drawn to a labyrinth near the mill by a 'faerie', and it is there she is introduced to the Faun (also known as 'Pan' in the English adaption, but the faun introduces himself as 'Faun'. 'Pan' comes from the mischievous faun god in Greek mythology). The Faun tells her that her true identity is Princess Moanna, born of the moon, and she must complete three tasks to prove her royalty.What I particularly loved about the princess concept is that it can either be interpreted as reality or escapism (fantastising about something better whilst being forced to live around death and pain). I think a lot of us (the less cynical) like to think that it is real, especially at the end.The juxtaposition of the brutality of Vidal and the war in general with the beautiful, surreal faerie-tale of Ofelia is a very intriguing contrast. Some of the scenes with Vidal I had to look away, some of it was too cruel and gory to watch. It's very cleverly done, especially as Vidal is drawn into the labyrinth with Ofelia at the end and sees her talking to no-one - is this because it doesn't exist (it's in her mind) or he is an adult/doesn't believe? Del Toro leaves this to our imaginations and forces us as an audience to come to a decision.Stunning visuals and effects, creative storyline and fantastic conclusion. El Laberinto Del Fauno is not something you want to miss.",9,2,5,24 September 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," I think only sailors would be able to withstand the camera usage.
","Having not seen the films before (and not being able to stand Matt Damon), I was reluctant to go see The Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to see it for AS Film Studies. However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a film with Damon in it could be enjoyable. Fast fight scenes, crazy motorbike chases and BIG explosions were what threw you out of your seat in TBU. The near-misses between the CIA and Bourne kept you on your toes and throughly entertained.Nevertheless, several things really grated my cheese.Firstly, the fact that the film was just a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull. Although Damon did keep us entertained and seemed always one step ahead of the CIA, I was getting a bit annoyed with the constant survival of Bourne. He crashed a car and got out as if he had tapped it or something! Very unrealistic.And secondly (inevitably) - the SHAKY CAMERA. It was so shaky it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even the tutors) seasick. We were told by the tutors that if we ever used that in a film we made in class, it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod. Fair enough if Greengrass wanted it to look like we were there watching Damon and Stiles holding a conversation, but surely we wouldn't be shaking our heads that violently!But all in all TBU is an enjoyable film and worth a watch. But I didn't think it was the best film of the year, despite being an entertaining piece of cinema.8/10.",8,2,3,25 September 2007
Shrek the Third," Shrek has been 'milked'.
","<ul><li>A repeat of the first film (Shrek goes to pick up someone who doesn't want to go with him, and delivers that person to someone else) - Gag after gag with no real storyline.</li></ul><ul><li>The gags aren't that funny.</li></ul><ul><li>Any good jokes were put on the trailers, which were shown to you about fifty times on TV and such, making them unfunny when you see the whole film.</li></ul><ul><li>Pointless use of characters (some characters did not need to be involved, such as the princesses).</li></ul><ul><li>You are waiting for the good bits to come on, but they never come.</li></ul>Why has all this happened? Because Shrek has been 'milked' (and will continue to be 'milked' as Shrek 4 and a Puss in Boots spin off are currently in production). Hollywood loves sequels, but this has pushed it too far.Worth seeing if you are a fan of the Shrek series, but you will be disappointed.5/10",3,1,2,1 November 2007
World Trade Center," Do NOT miss this movie.
","This movie was absolutely amazing.Acting by the two leads Cage and Pe√±a was very believable and tear-jerking. The movie itself was very cleverly made, despite some of the goofs within the film (many have noticed cars and advertisements that were introduced AFTER 9/11) - for example, even at the start police cars have dents in them (looking more realistic) and hardly any special effects were used.A gripping movie that will make you cry (it certainly made me cry and jump right out of my seat in some scenes!). I was 11 when the towers were hit so I didn't really take too much notice, being young. But now I realise what an impact this had upon America. My heart went out to everyone during that film.This is definitely a must-see. But not for the faint-hearted - this movie is very, VERY emotional.",10,2,5,14 October 2006
