Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," terribly disappointing
","I had no interest in seeing Borat - the trailers didn't look funny, clever, or interesting and I have never found Sacha Baron Cohen to be any of those thing, either. It's not like I disliked him before, I just had no interest in seeing him at all.However, after all of the hype, I rented Borat expecting a comedic masterpiece. I thought that I would finally realize what Cohen's appeal is.Boy was I wrong. There were a few laughs in the movie but I spent the majority of the time cringing.The 'humor' in this movie is always at someone else's expense, which doesn't make it funny, it just makes it mean.This isn't ground-breaking. It doesn't push any boundaries and it certainly doesn't make us take a good long look at our views of the world. It's just hateful and hurtful and mean.",1,3,8,19 August 2007
Get Out," Awful. Boring. Predictable. Racist.
