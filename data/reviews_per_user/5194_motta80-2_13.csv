Frost_Nixon," Howard redeems himself with a truly compelling film that leaves its theatrical roots behind
","It is a testament to Peter Morgan's humility and skill as a writer and Ron Howard's ability to take a based on real events story to which the outcome is widely known and create a compelling 'what will happen' drama (as he did with Apollo 13) that Frost/Nixon succeeds as a film.This is a film based on a play that neither felt trapped in staginess nor weakly expanded with just the stage dialogue delivered exactly but in a variety of outdoor locales. I have to give Peter Morgan a lot of credit here. I saw the play in London and wondered throughout production of the film how they would escape its theatricality. Many recent films from plays like Proof, Closer, The Producers, have failed to throw off the shackles of stage feel. Not that all bad films, many served as a good way to see the play if you hadn't had the chance, but they weren't necessarily compelling films in their own right. What is so impressive about Morgan's work here is that in adapting his own play he has not been precious, he has not tried to enforce his already successful stage-play onto a film director  he has wholly reworked it from beginning to end and yet retained all the gravity and drama that the play elicited. If you saw the play everything key is here and yet you can feel the difference  the pacing is changed, the power achieved in different ways.For this Howard also deserves credit. To have filmed the play as it was would have been disastrous on film  one long two-hander scene after another, duelling narrators. And given the reverence the play has enjoyed a less experienced director could have fallen into this trap or that of simply changing the settings, but Howard knows when we need quick cuts, when a long drawn out piece that worked on stage needs to be reduced to a couple of lines and a post-scene reaction, and when he needs to hold with a scene and let it play between the two leads. This happens in several impressive moments in the latter half of the film.For some this might constitute the films biggest flaw however. Morgan and Howard can't escape the fact that in the final stages of the film it is the head-to-head scenes of Frost and Nixon that are key and they must stay with them more. This is necessary, but it sadly means that the supporting players, so well established and broadened out to expand the scope in the first half, fall be the wayside. A superb Toby Jones as Irving 'Swifty' Lazar, Matthew Macfadyen as John Birt and always reliable Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick all but disappear and only Kevin Bacon and Sam Rockwell play any significant role beyond the two leads in the final stages. This is a shame. It may best serve the story creating the sense of claustrophobia necessary to keep you gripped but it does feel like a film of two halves because of it and it noticeable.Frank Langella and Michael Sheen are superb, as they were on stage, and Langella will take a lot of beating for the Oscar this year. There are many moments here when I was so involved I forgot I wasn't watching the real Nixon. It's not that he looks that like Nixon but he is so real you believe it completely and have to remind yourself you're watching an actor.Platt is reliably Platt. Bacon is also his typically understated solid presence doing a lot with little. Toby Jones is fantastic in a small role  instantly memorable; and Rebecca Hall builds on a series of strong performances. But in the supporting cast it is Rockwell that stands out. Sure, he has the most to do but he is completely in this role, he manages to sink into the role which is something he rarely does. He matches the skill he showed in Lawn Dogs and Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind here and it is great to see him back at his best.I thoroughly recommend this film.",9,101,146,16 October 2008
Minority Report," Great looking fun, but too predictable
","Minority Report is great entertainment, as it should be, and a vast improvement on A.I. (although I still believe that would have been good had it ended 30 minutes earlier in the script). Spielberg's latest does not suffer from its length (a few minutes shy of 2 1/2 hours) and seems to fly by.Tom Cruise is surprisingly good and fans will be pleased do know he still gets to do his trademark 'running-in-the-rain' scene. Max von Sydow is solid as usual and Lois Smith provides some relaxing humour and mischief.Best of all is the always good, but not always in good films, Colin Farrell who is far and away the most impressive actor on display here. I can't imagine a world in which Farrell will not become a huge star and this is just the sort of brilliantly understated performance (far less showy than his splendid turn in Tigerland) that will boost his career into the stratosphere.Also good is Kathryn Morris. Morris is an impressive actress with a dynamite smile that clearly grabbed Spielberg's attention when she appeared as an FBI agent in DreamWorks 2000 release The Contender. Also leaping from The Contender to Report is Mike Binder in a small role which he makes the most of.The biggest negative I can see to this film is that fun as it is it relies too heavily on plot twists you'll see a mile off. One important one is practically highlighted by Spielberg, in a surprising piece of ham-fisted direction from the legendary director, a good hour before the big 'reveal'. This is a shame because what was an interesting idea for a film suffers from cliche and over simplicity. Perhaps after the criticism that came A.I.'s way about over-complication Spielberg has gone too much the other way.Hopefully Christmas' release of Catch Me If You Can, starring Tom Hanks, will find the balance. Trust in Spielberg, he will return to his great form as shown in Schindler's List, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Last Crusade, Jaws, Close Encounters etc., unfortunately Minority Report isn't it. It's good but not great. Go see it, but don't expect too much and you should enjoy.",7,0,0,17 June 2002
Inglourious Basterds," Great fun, a real surprise
","It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill films (although i preferred the second) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven't hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.Then i read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and i hated it! Sure it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on page it was more juvenile rubbish, largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a Tarantino Q&A following in London. I figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in Q&A as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person.So little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds.Easily Mr Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown it is a triumph.Yes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunt casting but he works fine, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared. While i admired Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof in order to amp-up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino's own appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote.What really makes this work is how BIG it is. The spaghetti western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so big. The audacity so big. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers the Hitler moment and Pitt's performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune's blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn vibe to him, and of course a suitably Lee Marvin edge.Christoph Waltz (who i did not previously known) and Melanie Laurent (who i first noticed in a brilliant French-language British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future. Tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting, which seemed to desert him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally large in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here.That every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems pulled directly from the mold of Attenborough's Great Escape leader.All the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes, but ones that work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger's Hugo Stiglitz is a riot. After a sensational slow-burn opening and a glorious intro to those inglourious Basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by.It also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to real film-making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired from Morricone on.The film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining, but also involving and impressive film should be this one, when i would never have believed it from script form. Welcome back QT.",8,861,1603,23 July 2009
Chicken Run," Even better than Wallace & Gromit!
","Who could have believed that Nick Park (director of The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave) and the crew at Aardman animation would better Wallace & Gromit's originality with Chicken Run. Okay, Park and co-director Peter Lord had more time, more money, some big name star voices (Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson) but this works on every level. It really draws the audience in, the preview audience I saw it with were cheering, applauding, gasping. While it takes a little time to find its pace as it sets the scene and introduces the key characters and their motivation is soon roars ahead full steam, to the finale. Providing hilarious joke after hilarious joke and some inspired set pieces. Whatever else you see this summer, don't miss this!",10,0,0,13 June 2000
Spider-Man 3," Mild spoilers: Disappointing but not terrible
","I'm not going to sugarcoat it, Spider-Man 3 is disappointing. It's not terrible, but it's no Spider-Man 2 either. For my money the second film was the best of the three. With Spider-Man 3 they've dropped the ball. The most obvious comparison is X-Men 3. First film established well but had its flaws. Second film built character arcs, introduced new characters in a fluid way with exciting action and a solid story, third one forgot about the characters, largely wasted new ones and just went for spectacle. A fun ride to a certain extent but I had loved number two and three let me down, I expected more. Spider-Man 3 does the same.Spider-Man 3 is far too busy. For the first half hour it's ridiculous, doesn't know where to look as there are so many characters to introduce, re-establish, etc. There's so much going on and new characters Flint Marko, Eddie Brock and Gwen Stacy are all thrown in with no real intro. Where has the character development of S-M 2 gone? There are too many characters and not enough investment in them. Even the returning characters often seem tacked on. The ever-great JK Simmons' J Jonah Jameson still provides random comic effect, Aunt May appears out of nowhere once or twice.And the lack of development extends to the leads. You don't care about the relationship between Peter and Mary Jane in this one. Harry has the best through-line but only after a movie-device so hackneyed Ratner would think twice!Comedy: They've turned Spider-Man 3 into a cartoon. It feels a bit like watching Batman Forever (though no neon). The J Jonah Jameson comedy moments have gone from the amusement of his acerbic character to full on sitcom ridiculousness involving Ted Raimi, Elizabeth Banks' Miss Brant, JJ, pills and a vibrating, electrified desk. As a SNL skit this could work and it is kind of funny but these scenes feel out of place in this world.Then there's comedy Peter. New suit, new confidence, new attitude. The scene starts, the song works, it's fun. He makes a gesture to a passing woman, it's fun. He strolls down the street you think okay, having a bit of fun, time to move on. But no, let's continue this for another five minutes. This really overstays its welcome.And then there's Bruce Campbell. I love Bruce as Ash, I loved Bubba Ho-Tep, and I laughed at his cameos in Spidey 1 and 2. Here you feel the Campbell cameo is coming and... its so ludicrous it takes you out of movie again. Sure, he's funny but like the JJ desk sequence it is so extended and daft it suddenly feels like you're watching a Peter Sellers movie.The film is now so jokey, so surface, no texture that you wonder how the same people could be behind 2 and 3. I'll tell you this: Alvin Sargent may get a writing credit but most of this must have come from Sam and Ivan Raimi, there's very little to connect the script of 2 to that of 3.The old guys: Maguire overplays the part this time, he's becoming a caricature. Also when asked to look sad he just looks constipated. And his playing of dark Peter - atrocious, not a believable character for a minute.Kirsten Dunst is fine as Mary Jane. She has the character down and handles it well.James Franco is the best thing in the whole movie. He has the thankless task of dealing with the aforementioned ubercliche plot-turn in his character but ultimately he gets the only real development in the story and it's interesting, its well handled on the whole and Franco does a nice job with it. A whole movie with him as the main antagonist would have been a joy, or maybe one of two - so we have one new character - but no, let's have three and under use both of the other two. Which brings me to...The new guys: Thomas Haden Church is marvellous. He is in a different movie. He is believable, sincere, up to Alfred Molina's standard but without the juicy part. Every time he comes on screen the movie hits a different stride. My money's on Sargent did most of the Sandman character. He works perfectly, but he's sadly underused.Topher Grace is fine, but criminally underused. He's in the cartoon version, but then he's Venom! The sad thing is as Brock we barely meet him. He is a one dimensional side character there purely as a device to get Venom in. Sad, he deserves better, because then, when he's finally Venom, he's mostly lost in the effects.Bruce Dallas Howard is perfect and wonderful as Gwen Stacy. She does the best she can to give Gwen a full character despite having zero to work with and she pretty much succeeds. But again she's not a character, she's a device to add tension to the Peter/Mary Jane, Peter/Brock story lines. That she comes out of it as well as she does is testament to her abilities.The effects: The Sandman effects are stunning and for the most part they are closer to the high standard of 2, and much better than S-M 1.Set pieces: Okay, entertaining but nothing to match the tension and excitement of the train bit and the Ock bank battle in 2.Ultimately Spider-Man 3 will entertain you for much of its running time and it's not an awful film, it's not even bad. It's okay, maybe even edging on good. But it's disappointing because with the talent involved and coming off the excellent second film, and with the work Church, Howard and Franco especially are trying to give, it could have been so much better. But the clutter got the better of it.",7,17,35,19 April 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Got me onside, surprisingly good
","I am generally not a fan of musicals. I don't like the artifice of singing dialogue moments. I have no problem with singing in a movie but this grates on me. Take Dreamgirls for instance. For the most part i was fine with it, good songs, performed as performances with a narrative structure surrounding them. However once of twice it had songs in place of dialogue where characters were discussing things amongst themselves or some such thing and i just got annoyed. And yes i dislike all the classics like West Side Story for this very reason.For about the first 20-30 minutes of Sweeney Todd I was having the same problem. This makes no bones about it being a musical. It's not Rex Harrison speak-sing, it's not staged songs in the middle of clumps of dialogue, it's pretty much all singing. Everything. Every sentiment, every emotion, every plan, every aside. Yet after about 20 minutes or so i got used to it and went with it and then just appreciated the wonderful dark humour and sheer entertainment quality of it.Johnny Depp is great in the lead but he is complimented across the entire cast with Alan Rickman on fabulously villainous mode; Timothy Spall wonderfully revolting an Beadle Bamford - Rickman's henchman; and Helena Bonham Carter hilariously off-centre with all the best lines. It also has a star making turn from a brilliant child actor, Edward Sanders. Much better than the now ubiquitous Freddie Highmore (who got his big break with Depp in Finding Neverland before rejoining him (with Burton) in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory) he seems destined to have a great career potentially.The film's greatest achievement however is how Burton has translated it to screen. This is a purely film musical. It never feels stagey. Unlike recent films like The Producers, Dreamgirls, Chicago which felt largely like they'd stuck a camera in a theatre and just filmed the show here Burton is brave enough to create a cinematic musical using all the tricks of his craft. That is never feels like it belongs anywhere but on a cinema screen is a huge testament to Burton's skill in the translation and I hope the Academy is intelligent enough to recognise this come the Oscars next year.The dark humour is great, the look is stunning, Depp is gloriously unhinged while remaining believable. Even if, like me, you don't generally like this type of musical i think you'll get swept up in Sweeney Todd and enjoy it. Bravo Mr Burton.",9,72,115,7 December 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Fantastic fantasy - back to what Star Wars should be
","Great fun, stunning effects, self-referencing humour, less Jar-Jar, exciting set pieces, Jango Fett and little son Boba, action galore and the trademark dodgy, unintentional sexual innuendo abound dialogue - this is what a Star Wars film should be. While not in the league of Empire the film comes close to matching the glee with which generations have met the original Star Wars film, only falling short because 25 years of expectation and obsession don't allow Attack Of The Clones to match the originality of A New Hope in 1977. That said I don't see how any Star Wars fan, whether an obsessive fanatic or simply someone who has always just enjoyed the films as fun entertainment, could not like this film. With none of the flaws that Phantom Menace was accused of, even the scaled-down Jar Jar is less irritating, the film bodes well for Episode III. Ewan McGregor is now much more comfortable as Obi-Wan and appears to be enjoying himself more. Natalie Portman looks stunning in an array of fanciful costumes. Hayden Christensen gives the sense of hidden anger you need in a character with his destiny. Christopher Lee continues to corner the market in fantasy saga villains - all those whispering 'It's Saruman' to their friends will spend The Two Towers saying 'Look it's Dooku'. Best of all however are the brilliant Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine - the growth of this character was the best thing in Phantom Menace and is continued to great effect here - and the wonderful CG Yoda. I will not go into details but this film will leave you knowing why Yoda is THE jedi master after a scene that is, quite frankly, the crowning glory of the saga. It has been worth being a Star Wars fan for 25 years just for this scene. It is the pay-off with which George Lucas has rewarded his legions of followers. Keep it up George, we now look forward to 2005 with renewed enthusiasm. See this film as soon as you can, it won't leave you disillusioned in the way Phantom Menace did many people. Attack Of The Clones is a wonderful entertainment, book your tickets today!",10,0,0,13 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," Battle sequence is outstanding but cliche ridden plot makes this average
","It is difficult to know whether to start with the good or the bad so I'll be kind and start with the good points.I should let it be clear from the start, least my negative points seem too strong, that I enjoyed Pearl Harbor - and it is hard to know why, but I enjoyed it in the way you are supposed to enjoy a summer blockbuster, a Titanic or more typically a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. If you approach these in the right frame of mind, empty your brain, don't think too much and let yourself be entertained (while not being too cynical or anal about historical fact meets historical licence). Then even if your favourite movies are the realm of Woody Allen and Neil LaBute (like myself) you can like a film like Pearl Harbor on its own level.The positives:The film held some surprises in the acting stakes, not least that Dan Aykroyd can be a very good serious actor (who knew!). Josh Hartnett is also strong and should come out of this the best, it can only do him good - high profile, leading role and he holds his own well. Cuba Gooding Jr, in a role that should have been bigger in my opinion, was moving and exciting to watch but the story used him far too little. Outstanding however, and I mean (am I really about to suggest that this film could get any statuettes!!!) supporting actor Oscar worthy as FDR. Almost unrecognisable under heavy prosthesis he delivers a believable and powerful performance that brings a sense of class to the scenes he appears in and is magnetic. You will be completely swept up when he is on screen, a performance that a Bruckheimer film really doesn't deserve and an audience wouldn't expect in one.The centre piece battle sequence is also superbly staged. While you may be looking at your watch during the 90 minutes it takes to get to it you won't even notice the time flying by during this sequence. Appearing like the last hour of Titanic meets the first 30 mins of Saving Private Ryan the epic scale and grandeur will sweep you up and keep you enthralled. And then you are back to the plot! Damn!Negatives:The obvious choice for a new live-action Pinocchio, Ben Affleck is so wooden that you'd expect to see a woodpecker land on his shoulder and have a tap. To be fair he gets all the hammy lines and cod-heroic bravura that accompany a character in this sort of cliche ridden story (think Bruce Willis in Armageddon) but he fails to rise above it and this hampers the film. Equally all the women in the film, led by Kate Beckinsale, are given thankless roles and end up as caricatures. Beckinsale is fine but not good. She walks through the role giving the annoying impression that she could do better but can't be bothered.The less said about the story and script the better. The dialogue is laughable (particularly in the first hour) and raises unintentional sniggers throughout. The over sentimental love story is about as contrived as a film can get and could be likened to an MGM musical in terms of realism! Randall Wallace (writer of The Man In The Iron Mask and Braveheart) may have done justice to the real life characters (Voight and Gooding Jr) and the battles but the story makes the script of Titanic look like Casablanca.Equally Michael Bay and Hans Zimmer need to be dragged out and shot for trying to manipulate the audience into accepting a love story that doesn't work. The music wells up, the hero shots come into full effect the trademark Bruckheimer/Bay slowmo running and contrived close-ups appear from nowhere. I fail to recall the last time a film used music so much to suggest the emotions you should be feeling when you are blatantly not in the same frame on mind as Mr Zimmer, the composer. The effect is grating, you'll wish you had a mute button for the first hour, or preferably a fast forward button. Bay and Wallace have managed to get every movie cliche you can imagine into this piece (most within the first ten minutes which is an appalling episode in the young lives of our two heroes as way of a backstory) and if you make a list of them before you go you'll be able to tick them off as you watch.To conclude the battle scenes make this worth watching on the big screen and Voight, Gooding Jr and Hartnett will hold your attention, but the story and dialogue let it down. An average film where it could have been great, but still a good entertainment is looked upon as such.",8,0,0,24 May 2001
No Country for Old Men," Coens firing on all cylinders. Brilliant.
","If this doesn't end my year in the top two films of the year then we are in for one hell of an awesome year of movies.The new film from two of the best filmmakers working today No Country For Old Men shows the talents of the Coen Brothers on top form. After a couple of disappointments (Intolerable Cruelty had flashes of Coen genius but felt more of a Coen imitation than the real thing; Ladykillers had the odd funny moment but was the blandest film the brothers ever made, and there's just no excusing Marlon Wayans!) they knock this violent western drama out of the park.More in the vein of their superb early mostly-serious efforts Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing (my personal favourite of the Coen back catalogue) No Country For Old Men is a slow-moving, character-driven masterpiece about uncompromising and uncompromised characters. It is very violent and bloody and not always for the squeamish.Shot through with moments of humour these come, as in life, from real situations and observations so don't be fooled into thinking this will be the serious film with goofy-characters Coens of Fargo. No Country For Old Men is a tough, gritty story.The unrelenting pace may take its time but you are gripped every moment. This is a thriller that genuinely thrills.Javier Bardem gives the best performance of his career. And, yes, I have seen The Sea Inside and he in superb in that but here he is simply extraordinary. It is a portrayal of unrelenting evil, of true derangement, of a human being with no shreds of humanity that ranks at the very top of studied film psychopaths. And I say film not movie because this is not a clichéd character. This is not a character whose lunacy you enjoy over popcorn. This is one of the most frightening performances ever committed to celluloid. I felt truly nervous of what was going to happen every time he walked on screen.Josh Brolin essentially carries the bulk of the movie and he is excellent in a role that challenges him. I have never seen him perform to this level and if Bardem didn't steal the film you'd be talking about Brolin all the way home. As it is this gives him a showcase for his talents that should see him get a lot more attention.Tommy Lee Jones is used sparingly but to great effect. Sounding more like Michael Parks than ever before his scenes pepper the movie with a wearied view on a world he doesn't really like or understand to great effect.I did find Stephen Root a little distracting as i have never seen him in a serious role before and he just looks amusing but he is in very little.Roger Deakins' cinematography is breathtaking as usual and the Coens' script is superbly crafted. There are moments, almost asides from the main plot, that would be superfluous in most scripts and excised in most studio films but which work perfectly in the overall context of the movie as only the Coens can achieve. One scene featuring Bardem in a gas station is up there with the best scenes i have ever seen on film.I have not gone into the plot here because I saw this film having not read Cormac McCarthy novel and knowing little other than the basic log-line - a man out hunting comes upon a scene of dead bodies, guns, drugs and money on the Mexican border and comes to the attention of both those behind the scene and a local world-wearied sheriff - and i think that's the way to see this film.Go in knowing as little as you can but knowing at least this: this is a serious, violent, slow-paced character piece from the Coens. This is not a Fargo. If you are squeamish don't see it. If you have a short-attention span don't see it. If you only love the Coens for their fantastic comedies like O Brother and Big Lebowski and the comedy/thriller Fargo don't see it. But if you want to see an intelligent, superbly acted, powerful, beautiful cinematic treat that will remind you of the true power of cinema see it, see it, see it. It's a masterpiece. Bravo Ethan and Joel.",10,1073,1568,16 May 2007
Batman Begins," Everything I could have hoped for
","I had fearful reservations about this one. I loved Tim Burton's Batman - 12 years old when it came out I was the perfect age for it and I also enjoyed Batman Returns. The franchise went so wrong under Joel Schumacher that I wasn't sure I wanted it resurrected. Not least because Batman was one of the few comics I read and enjoyed as a kid and was always my favourite superhero. I grew up reading the comics, watching reruns of the Adam West TV show and then getting Burton's celluloid vision. I was spoilt for choice as a kid but as an adult now I was concerned revisiting the franchise, especially given Warner's record over the last decade of screwing up summer blockbusters with potential all over the place (dare I bring up the Matrix sequels?)However, I am pleased to report I could not have been more wrong about how great Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is. This is better than Burton. Sacrilege, you say?! Well Burton was still cartoony in many elements, he wasn't churning out the bilge of Schumacher but Burton's Batman was still over the top. As a kid this was ideal but Nolan's Batman is real. Everything in this world seems plausible and it is therefore a world that draws you in. Characters' vulnerability is that much more present. Every bruise, every scare, every concern, every emotion seems real.Part of this is that Nolan has assembled an exemplary cast. Again, this concerned me prior to seeing the film. I wasn't sure a cast of big name legends like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman and well known names like Liam Neeson and Katie Holmes wouldn't detract and distract from Batman. I was always sure Christian Bale could be the great moody Batman he's been waiting his career to be but the others I wasn't so sure about.That said Bale is not just good, he's superb. I never thought I'd really be able to envision anyone other than Michael Keaton as the definitive Batman for me but since seeing Batman Begins a couple of days ago Bale has cemented himself in the position. Perhaps Keaton will now be able to escape the spectre of Batman he hasn't truly shaken off for 13 years.The rest of the cast is also pitch perfect. Cillian Murphy is creepy as hell, Liam Neeson is authoritative and imposing, Katie Holmes is strong and sexy (I particularly thought she'd be insipid, she should jettison Tom Cruise and let her talent - which she does have naysayers just watch Pieces Of April - speak for itself) and Michael Caine is an Alfred you've never seen but in fact far more likely as a butler than the aristocratic pomp with which he is usually portrayed. Gary Oldman is also superb in a rare wholly decent character for him as Lieutenant Jim Gordon who gets far more to so here than Gordon has ever had to do before. Only Tom Wilkinson is a little off with a slightly comedic wise-guy American accent that never really convinces.The emotional bond between Bruce Wayne and Alfred is actually a wonderful human heart to the film than Nolan and Goyer have written perfectly.Don't let that make you think the action is not front and centre though. From Wayne's training through the early stages of the film to his early missions as Batman at about the half way point to a thrillingly choreographed chase sequence and an edge of your seat finale this film delivers the cool quotient in bucket loads.Great villains (especially Murphy), great story, great cast, great action... put simply, great film. Probably the best comic-book movie ever made (that's excluding the genius Sin City which I consider a moving comic-book rather than a comic-book movie, that will never be bettered but Batman is a different beast and the best of its kind).",10,1303,1550,6 June 2005
Castle in the Sky," Miyazaki at his best, a breathtaking adventure of a film
","My conversion to the Miyazaki mind set is now complete. I suspectthis visionary genius, whose talents had rarely been given majoraccess to the average westerner until his glorious Oscar winningSpirited Away, is capable of doing no wrong.Castle In The Sky is a beautifully crafted joyride that reminds youwant its like to be young. The animation is undeniable superb andthe voice cast (of the English dubbed version) well selected.However it is the sheer sense of wonder that gets you. LikeSpirited Away Miyazaki's scale of imagination is extraordinary. Arare talent in adults.For most people as you grow older the mundanities of life run youdown and help to destroy your imagination bit by bit. Some artistsare capable of taping into that childlike imagination andrecapturing some of the wonder and spectacle. I would argue thatin the film world Steven Spielberg, John Lasseter and (representing the slightly more mischievous child) Joe Dante areamong the best at this. Films such as E.T., Toy Story andInnerspace, Indiana Jones, Monsters, Inc. and Gremlins provide alandscape of adventure and fun, unbridled childish excitement.
Anyone who's ever enjoyed The Goonies as a child knows whatI'm talking about and still gets nostalgic at a cry of 'hey, you guys'!It's not the same if you experience it as an adult usually. That ispart of the problem with the new Star Wars films. So many peoplewho watched the original trilogy through the wide eyes ofchildhood cannot see the same qualities in the new films unlessthey access their imagination and childlike sense of awe, forgetwhat they know about criticism and technical specifications (likeeffects etc) that they were blissfully unaware of in childhood andlook at these films as if they were a kid again. The wonder of Miyazaki is that he seems not to be accessingchildlike qualities, but genuinely seems to still possess theimagination of a pre-teen. Even more incredible is the way he canchannel this to his audience through his stories and imagery.Castle In The Sky, like Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and hisother films, contains characters and situations few could conceiveof. I do not want to give anything away of the story as it should beexperienced first hand to truly capture the overwhelming scale andinventiveness.Miyazaki is a genius. Castle In The Sky in superior to PrincessMononoke but falls just short of his masterpiece Spirited Away.Believe John Lasseter see them all. See My Neighbor Totoro,Kiki's Delivery Service etc. Experience them all. Awaken the childwithin you and count the days until Howl's Moving Castle (releasedin 2004) with the desperate impatience of a small child. Enjoy.",10,1,1,1 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," Joins the rare ranks of superior sequels
","I have to admit I had high hopes for this going in, which I don't usually allow myself for Hollywood big budget films - so often rubbish! However this was Bryan Singer, a great cast and the X-Men (a comic I loved as a kid). I was disappointed with the first film which was good but not the spectacular entertainment I had been hoping for. Now X2, this surpassed all my expectations.I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say much but the scope of the film is much broader giving all the characters a proper storyline and blending three major plotlines seemlessly. You would imagine that at two and a quarter hours the film might seem too long but that is never the case. Uncommon for Hollywood summer efforts X2 is dense with plot and characters but is never weighed down by it.The action is superb. From the moment the film opens with a stunning sequence which introduces a new character (won't say who you'll just have to seee it) to the very end the effects and stunt work are breath-taking.As for the acting it is solid throughout. Once again it is Sir Ian McKellen and Hugh Jackman that steal the film - along with the always excellent Brian Cox. However Famke Janssen and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos also shine in far better roles than they were given in the original film.My advice is see this as soon as you can because you'll want to see it more than once if you like it and if you don't then you were probably the person who never expected to like it in which case, well,  no harm no foul.Those of you who want a kick-ass start to the blockbuster season but not as dumb and plotless as most, enjoy. Let's all just hope The Matrix Reloaded continues the quality while we wait for the end of joys that will hopefully be Kill Bill, Intolerable Cruelty, The Matrix Revolutions and (deep breath) The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King. Role on 2003.",9,0,1,28 April 2003
Sin City," Groundbreaking visuals in an outstanding film set to make a mark in history
","Sin City is a truly extraordinary piece of film-making that astounds you with its visual flair, its tone-perfect cast and utter uniqueness. Robert Rodriguez has once again, more so than ever, shown himself as a true visionary, not just in his realisation of this complex story but in his pioneering digital work.It is a film that should rightly hold a place forever in history as the first that truly demonstrated what could be achieved with digital technology.Like a living comic book (it really brings the comic to life in an exact translation that no comic-book film has ever captured before) with this film he has rewritten the possibilities of film-making.Mickey Rourke and Benicio Del Toro stood out in an exceptional cast that was faultless. They handled the extreme delivery of very comic-book dialogue (unlike anything most directors would be brave enough to let on screen for fear of critical ridicule from the uninitiated or just those unwilling to let go of all they know about film and witness the birth of a new phenomenon) in their stride neither hamming it up nor toning it down. Even actors I am normally a little wary of like Josh Hartnett and Clive Owen put in strong performances while Elijah Wood is positively freaky.The film as a whole truly infested my mind and made it impossible firstly for me to put into words how blown away by it I was but also to think about anything other than the film for several hours afterwards (I still can't shake lines and visuals from my mind a day later).It's also fun to contemplate which scene Quentin Tarantino directed.The use of the early, more jumping scenes was ingenious ahead of three longer narratives for initiating the style for people so that certain visuals, cartoonish laws of gravity, glorious costumery, etc didn't distract you in the main sections.It is also one of those that begs to be seen over and over. It grabs you and doesn't let go almost making it impossible to take everything in. I can't wait to see it again, and own the DVD.I think it is a film once seen never forgotten and even those who don't appreciate the style I am sure will see its place in history as  groundbreaking new artistry.I applaud all involved and hope Rodriguez continues to make films this visceral and exciting in the future.",10,0,2,20 April 2005
