Hereditary," Still makes me feel uneasy second time around
","I will not spoil anything but this movie has a little bit of everything you would expect from a horror movie made in the past 10 years.Genuinely scary and downright creepy at times that make you check yourself to see if you're still breathing , the movie contains subtle music at times that set the mood and don't ever reach a midpoint. Everything is super dreary , dark , and in a place that you wouldn't ever want to go.We start with the main woman in the film as she grieves and tries to figure out who her mother really is after her death and after that , things go drastically downhill for the remaining family members and the last 20 minutes are the scariest moments in a film I've ever experienced.Watch the trailer , it doesn't show off much and you can get a simple brainstorm from that.",10,2,5,29 September 2019
