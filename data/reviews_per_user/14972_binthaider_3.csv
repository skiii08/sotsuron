Sucker Punch," I would give it a ZERO if i could!
","how pathetic and ridiculous this movie is! OMG! The story-line is not bad but the execution is cringing! I had to forward all the parts that the action was happening in. when babydoll was dancing. I just couldn't watch the pretence! Babydoll was just that a BABYDOLL.it was horrible,cringing, crap, laughable and EMBARRASSING to watch! The worst movie i have ever watched without a doubt!!! I am a movie freak and believe me there is absolutely nothing I can compare this movie with it was that disappointing!There better not be a part 2 EVER!HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, YOU WILL NEVER GET IT BACK!",Null,0,2,23 October 2011
The Expendables," Lol! A film you can laugh at. Sheer Rubbish!
","I'm not one to write reviews very often but in this case I really thought i have to. This film has considerably more prominent actors than most films. So that's quite rare. However for me this movie did not gel what-so-ever! There was so humour/comedy in it that just made me cringe. I had to fast forward parts because it was so embarrassing. Like when the generals daughter walks into the 'bar' and sees Sylvester (who by the way needs a voice transplant). I mean this movies lead roles are acting as though they are in there prime. When they clearly aren't. Eric Roberts was such a bad 'baddy'. lol. His acting made me laugh! Seriously couldn't they find someone to play the part at least half decent? Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis shouldn't even have made an appearance! There was no point! or they should have got some 'not known' actors to do those roles! Such bad Rubbish acting and most of the lines these people came up with are was just plain pathetic. Sylvester looked old and shrunken with his pecks up to his neck! Dolph was just an embarrassment! Enough said! Terry Crews was a disappointment but then again he wasn't meant to be one of the lead players, so can't say much.The only thing I enjoyed was the two fights Jason Statham was in & one of Jet-Li's fights. The script was written for younger actors not actors that are past there 'sell by date'. There are many older actors out there playing respectable lead roles that suit them. I think these people need to start doing the same! 60 year old's acting as though they are tough kick-ass action guys made the whole film cringe worthy! & the whole concept of Sylvester seeing a girl old enough to be his grand daughter and within 10 minutes asking her to leave with him (forgetting the little children on the Island) just made me want to punch the TV! It was unrealistic and the actors were way too old for this kinda job! A HUUUGGGE disappointment!",1,8,15,19 November 2010
Mission: Impossible II," too much slow motion, CHEESY lines and crap music to accompany scenes. EMBARRASSING!
","I've not watched it in a very long time and am currently at 1hr and 35mins into it! OMG how pathetic and CRINGING. i had to hide under my duvet when the scenes went into slow motion, which felt like every couple of minutes! The lines are soooooo unbelievably CHEESY and the gunshot scenes just kept making me want to throw something at the TV. it was like Ballet! Why oh why do these people not tie up there hair and why in the world do they spin each other around whilst trying to 'save' them. And although i do believe in love at first sight this was just craziness! I felt embarrassed for the actors! The whole film was just ridiculous. way too long i believe due to too much slow motion scenes that didn't really belong. The story-line is good but how it was executed and produced was crap and whoever wrote those cheesy lines need to go back to school.",Null,1,2,31 July 2011
