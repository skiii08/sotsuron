Requiem for a Dream," Superbly Disturbing
","This is one the best movies I have ever seen. Granted, it does not leave the viewer with happy and warm feelings at the end. However, the movie is so enthralling that I have seen it more times than I can count.It's an excellent portrayal of the darkness of drugs and addiction, told through the interwoven stories of the characters. Personally, I think this is Marlon Wayans best performance. Jared Leto is remarkable, fitting into the role perfectly. Jennifer Connelly is superb. The standout is Ellen Burstyn. I can't say enough about her performance. I can't even describe the movie with adequate words. Surely, some scenes are downright disturbing -- Leto's character in the hospital, Connelly's 'predicament' at the end -- but it all fits perfectly into the plot.All I know is that I watch it whenever I have the opportunity. I wish I had seen this in the theatre. In short, if you have not seen this film, see it as soon as you can.10 out of 10",10,0,1,1 October 2004
The Notebook," Excellent
","I, like many others, was expecting the typical romance/love story. And as it started out, when we discover that Allie is the rich girl and Noah is the country boy, I figured I was getting what I anticipated. But as I watched the film, I realized there was more to the story. I don't want to get into it too much, but needless to say, I was very happy by the end. Also, it has to be noted that Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams have tremendous chemistry on screen. Also, Gena Rowlands and James Garner give moving performances in their respective roles. Although I found one of the plot twists quite easy to identify, it was developed in a very interesting way, which didn't ruin it for the viewer. I unfortunately have little time to read for leisure with my hectic class schedule. However, I am pretty sure I will pick up the next Nicholas Sparks novel. All in all, a very moving tell of human emotion which brings you in to the story.",10,5,9,8 February 2005
The Butterfly Effect," Excellent
","I saw this movie quite some time ago, but I just watched it again on cable. I realized there is an alternative ending which I had not seen. I don't know why I was unaware of this, but I was. I actually own the DVD, I liked it that much. I had not commented on it, but after seeing for the tenth time, I decided I should. OK, so Ashton Kutcher can really act. Anyone who says he can't must have had their eyes closed during this film. I could care less about his personal life or Punk'd or anything like that. The truth is this movie is quite original and he did a fantastic job. The rest of the cast is great too. Although the movie is unrealistic, it's only a movie. The truth is that the story is interesting and the movie ends quite nicely with a twist. I won't comment on the particulars for those who have seen this. I just had to comment to say that this is one of my favorite movies. Any movie I can watch so many times without becoming bored or changing the channel deserves some credit. If you haven't seen, see it. It's worth two hours and then some.",10,1,3,14 January 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Too Heavy
","I forced my boyfriend to go see this with me the other night with the promise (false, though it may be) that it involved some boxing. Well, he just hated it. Not because it didn't involve too much boxing, but because it made him feel so sad, so depressed as we left the theater, that he just hated it. He said he was nauseated at the end (and throughout the last 30 minutes of the film) because it was just too heavy. My perspective is unfortunately quite similar. We both agreed that the acting was superb, but the story itself was just too sad. It was refreshing to see a movie without the clich√© happy ending, but this takes it to new extremes. It was difficult to watch because of the sadness. I can only describe it as 'heavy.' There were a few moments of levity, but not enough to help us escape from the grips of depression and despair the movie so masterfully conveyed. I gave this film 8 out of 10 because it was a great movie. However, I will NEVER see it again. I can't go through it again, and I think my boyfriend would kill me if I brought it home. Just a note... we at least made it through the entire film, but others in the theater were not as tolerant. That being said, I will defend the film, because I am certain the people did not leave because it was bad, but because they just couldn't take any more. I guess that is why it deserved the Oscar. But, all in all, it was a VERY difficult movie to watch. That makes it excellent, I suppose. Unfortunately, MDB will not go on my favorites list. I can appreciate it for the masterpiece it was, but I don't want to suffer through it again. It was just too hard to watch (mainly towards the end). Also, I am usually a crier, but I managed to compose myself through MDB. However, the other patrons, as mentioned earlier, were also not as fortunate. An amazing film that perfectly demonstrates the genius of Clint Eastwood as well as Morgan Freeman, and the amazing ability of Hilary Swank to morph into any character.... it was just SO sad and TOO HEAVY!! I know I keep saying it, but that is the best way to describe it. P.S. - 'Danger' was some nice comic relief, but even he was victim to minor tragedy.... just another example of the heaviness of this film.",8,0,0,29 March 2005
Saw," Really Disturbing....In a Good Way
","THIS DEFINITELY HAS SPOILERS SO BEWARE!!!!Considering its tiny budget and short filming time, this movie was excellent. There is definitely a 'Se7en' feel to it, but not so much that it's repetitive. The story itself is quite original, especially in its execution. Granted, the killer making others do the killing isn't that original, but 'Saw' is by no means typical. OK, so I really enjoyed the movie, but, as always, I have some griping to do. SPOILERS!SPOILERS! SPOILERS!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!! SPOILERS!!!!!! First - the ending - I was a little annoyed. Not so much by the unveiling of Jigsaw, but the implausibility of him being in the room the entire time without a trained oncologist realizing he was not dead. Second - the Zep or Zap factor - his 'game' seems a little convoluted. I understand this is a movie, but it could have been done a little better. Why make him a part of all this, when he seemed to defend John at the hospital as a person? Third - the sawing - why wouldn't the Doctor use his shirt to get the cell phone and tell his wife he was still there? He could have found out that she was safe. Did he really think he could saw off his foot and save himself? That bothered me. It could have been a different twist, like the wife was OK, but Jigsaw was on his way to finish the Doctor off or something like that. Fourth - Cary Elwes in general - I don't know. At times he just seemed out of place. His hair was too blonde and he was almost chunky. Maybe he was supposed to seem pompous and yuppie-like, but at times I found it unbelievable. Fifth - the loose ends - Did the Doctor actually die? Granted, he was dragging himself out of the bathroom at the end pale as a ghost and he probably made it only ten more feet, but who knows? Do they later find his body? A loud thump five seconds after he crawled out would have done it. (Maybe there was one and I missed it, so I apologize if I did). Do they later find Adam shriveled and dead with Zap or Zep (I am unsure which it is)? Are they leaving the loose ends for a sequel? Didn't Jigsaw have a frontal lobe tumor, so he was dying before all of this began? All that being said, I still rated this movie 9/10. Why? Because it was that good. So good, in fact, I found myself picking out the aforementioned little things. Why even nit pick like that? Because it could have been perfect. 'Saw' had all the potential but only came through about 95%. And that is why I was a little annoyed at the end. Again, still a great movie. One of the best horror/suspense films in a LONG time. Original, creative, scary, freaky, disturbing, etc. Despite what I have said, I highly recommend this movie. Be warned that it can be quite graphic, but it is definitely worth it.",9,2,5,15 February 2005
Ray," Absolutely Fantastic!
","First let me say that I am only 24, so I was never a big fan of Ray Charles. It's not that I don't like his music, it's just that I really never experienced it. That being said, I also tend to dislike the biopic, only because movies are so much more difficult to watch when you realize the tragic elements actually happened to a living person. OK, enough about that, back to the film. Jamie Foxx is utterly amazing. He should win the Oscar and any other award possible. I frequently felt as though I was watching Ray Charles, not an actor, on the screen. Additionally, the movie itself was great. It was truly riveting. The viewer feels involved in the story. It doesn't just paint a picture - it takes you there. Granted, it was a little bit long, but I didn't even notice. I can't say enough about this movie. To capture the life of such a American legend with such perfection is really quite an accomplishment. I can't rave about it enough. I could go on and on, but just watch it and see for yourself.",10,1,2,2 February 2005
The Social Network," Justin Timberlake CANNOT act
","The Social Network wasn't bad, but I definitely don't get the hype. At all.OK, interesting story, very well-acted by Eisenberg, with some pretty impressive supporting cast.Enter Timberlake - who plays the douche-y guy trying to weasel his way into something that wasn't his all too well - because it's not really 'acting' it's what he does in this film. He's a blatant error throughout the whole film. Frankly, he doesn't deserve to be in the company of the actors, and I'd be insulted to have to share time with him simply because he sang in NSync and dated Britany Spears.It was a good movie. It kept your attention for the two hours, so I give it credit. But I definitely don't feel the hype.",6,0,0,12 April 2011
