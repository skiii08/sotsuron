It," It's The Best Adaptation Of Novel
","Muschietti helms an exceptional horror mystery drama. Of all of King's canon of novels this ranks, in this viewer's opinion, as the fourth best adaptation behind Kubrick's 'The Shining', Reiner's 'Misery' and Reiner's 'Stand By Me'. This film has substantial direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, special effects, score and acting. All of the actors involved deliver appreciable performances. In particular Lillis and Skarsgard are superb. Skarsgard's portrayal of the daft, horrific and savage Pennywise is so convincing it was as if I was reading the novel again back in the late 80's. The plot is set in Derry, ME in the summer of 1989. A year earlier Bill Denbrough's younger brother George goes missing and Bill is grief stricken but continues to believe that George is alive. In 1988 George had been chasing a paper folded sailboat along a curb on a rainy day when the boat drops into a storm drain. That is when the devious and deranged Pennywise convinces Georgie to come close enough to retrieve his boat and come float with the others. Bill's friends are skeptical of George still being alive but appease Bill in his investigation. His friends all have struggles of their own and include Ben who is overweight and constantly bullied; Richie who uses foul language and a loud mouth to gain attention; Stanley who is the son of an oppressive rabbi and is haunted by a ghoulish women; Mike who is a lonely black kid living on the outskirts of Derry and cherishes having friends; Eddie who is always sick and constantly using his inhaler and Beverly who is the new tomboy in town who lives with an extremely abusive father. They are constantly being harassed and bullied by a psychopath Henry Bowers and his gang. Ben discovers in a library that Derry has been plagued for centuries by tragedies that occur every 27 years. Pennywise terrorizes each of the kids by capitalizing on their weaknesses. After they all realize they have all had encounters with the entity they give Pennywise the moniker It. They call themselves 'The Losers Club' and determine It travels though the sewer lines undetected and resides in a well where all the lines connect. The well is under a well known abandoned haunted house. The seven confront Pennywise at the house and Beverly is able to fight the entity off forcing It to retreat. Beverly is kidnapped by Pennywise which forces the remaining six to venture down into the harrowing lair of It which has bodies of the missing children floating atop a mountainous pile of children's toys, clothing and circus props. There they encounter a now insane Bowers and must do battle with It. The plot is thrilling, intelligent, captivating, insightful, cathartic, spine-tingling and has an ambiguous ending. In this viewer's opinion the film examines the struggles of youth and the power of friendship. The main theme is that as one each character has their own struggles and weaknesses but as group they heal each other and become a powerful force that can accomplish their dreams in life. The film has many hair-raising scenes that deliver nightmarish chills. My favorite scene is when 'The Losers Club' is viewing a slide projector that speeds up as if they were watching a video reel and Pennywise first appears on a screen before propelling forward out of it. There are also many sinister quotes. My favorite is when Pennywise is introducing himself to George so that they'll know each other and he says in a creepy and frightening voice, 'Well I'm Pennywise and you're Georgie'. The ambiguous ending was perfect as the story continues in the novel after the encounter with Pennywise at the well as 'The Losers Club' reunites 27 years later. This film is now labeled as 'It' Chapter One. Chapter Two is due this year. This is a film that delivers psychological and terrifying jolts. It is a significant film in 'It's', pun intended, genre.",7,0,2,5 May 2019

This is one of the very best films in the crime / thriller genre. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, settings, editing, score, cinematography and acting. Pearce, Moss and Pantoliano deliver superb performances. Pearce commands the screen. His narration intensifies the mystery as the journey unfolds. The score also plays just as an important role as the characters as it adds to the thrilling and intense tone of the film.

The film is certainly a memorable and sublime work of art.",9,3,7,10 May 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Much Needed New Blood And A Masterful Stand Alone Story

Milk," Van Sant's Best To Date
","I've been a Van Sant fan since ' Drugstore Cowboy' and ' My Own Private Idaho'. He is able to create masterful works of art while tackling some of the most controversial and difficult subject matter. This is his best work to date and a bravura biopic drama. This film has superlative direction, screenplay, cinematography, soundtrack, settings, costume and acting. Penn, Franco, Brolin, Hirsch, Luna, Cross and Pill are superb. Penn delivers the finest and most commanding portrayal of his stellar career. I've seen a documentary on Harvey and it was as if I was viewing actual footage of him. The plot revolves around Harvey Milk who became the first openly gay man elected to the first notable public office seat on the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco. Before accomplishing that goal Harvey, his partner Scott and friends transform the Castro District of San Francisco into a safe haven for gays and lesbians. He achieves these goals against all odds and some less then fair political opposition. He stood up to such bigots as Anita Bryant and John Biggs during the process. A member of his board is a politically and socially straight laced God fearing Christian Dan White. White has been on the supporting side of a proposition to ban gays and lesbians from teaching in public schools. This proposition sparks a course of events that leads White to becoming unhinged, hateful and out for vengeance. The plot is witty, clever, realistic, surreal, insightful, violent, exorcising, heart wrenching and cathartic. This film is an outstanding examination of how human beings pathetic inability to accept or at least tolerate beliefs other than their own has divided this country and destroyed lives unnecessarily. Van Sant's tribute and celebration of a groundbreaking and courageous man is flawless, bold and brilliant. This is a timeless classic and an ingenious film in it's genre.",9,0,1,10 May 2019

Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," 'Ya Think You Used Enough Dynamite There Butch?'

Black Mass," Depp's Depth
","Cooper helms a substantial crime drama based on real events. This film's narrative mirrors the real life documentary based on Bulger's trials in the outstanding documentary, 'Whitey: United States of America V. James J Bulger' by Academy Award- nominated director Joe Berlinger which adds to the realism and accuracy of this film. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, soundtrack, settings and acting. All artists involved deliver superlative performances. Depp, Edgerton and Cumberbach in particular stand out. However it is Depp that truly commands the screen. The plot revolves around real life infamous gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger who terrorized South Boston as the leader of the 'Winter Hill Gang' and his brother Bill who is a powerful leader in the Massachusetts Senate. Set in Boston during the 1970's, the Irish hoodlum Whitey pursues a life of crime using ruthless and brutal tactics. Eventually he is approached by FBI Agent John Connolly and is convinced to help the agency fight the Italian mob and take out his competition. Soon enough their unholy alliance ends but Whitey continues to increase in power and evade capture becoming one of the most dangerous and deceiptful gangsters in U.S. history. There are many memorable scenes and quotes in this film. This viewer's favorite is when we see how brash, feared and vicious Whitey was when he guns down a victim in broad daylight surrounded by witnesses. He then strolls away without a care in the world as if nothing happened and it's just part of his normal day. The film is duplicitous, gritty, violent, intense, realistic, formidable and has a cathartic ending. The film is mesmerizing, captivating and is one of the better films in it's genre.",8,1,2,16 May 2019
Shutter Island," Close The Shutters
","Scorsese helms a virtuous psychological thriller based on Dennis Lehane's novel of the same title. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, special effects, score, editing and acting. The score and settings are as chilling as the characters and storyline. The entire cast delivers superlative performances. DiCaprio and Ruffalo command the screen. Their portrayals of two U.S. marshalls, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule compliment each other perfectly. The plot is flawless as the two marshalls attempt to solve the mystery of an escaped patient, Rachel Solando who is considered to be extremely dangerous, from an asylum for the criminally insane. The asylum is located on an island and after brief questioning the detectives seem satisfied to return to the mainland. However an impending storm forces the two to stay on the island longer than anticipated which leads to more investigating and the uncovering of a miscount in the number of patients at the asylum. There should be 67 patients. Now the genuine mystery begins. The detectives are assisted in their search for the patient with the help on Dr. Cawley, the Assistant Warden and the staff. As their investigation continues events begin to unfold that trigger Teddy's subconscious forcing him to face the reality of his past which involves a horrific incident involving his wife Dolores Chanal. The investigation takes the detectives to the darkest depths of the asylum and the island where Teddy encounters Andrew Laeddis. Teddy's focus is turned to a lighthouse just off shore after he locates Rachel. He believes sinister acts are occurring there. When he eventually reaches the lighthouse the real truth about patient 67 is revealed by Dr. Cawley. Teddy learns that Chuck isn't he who appears to be, and through the law of 4 that Rachael and Andrew are also not as they appear. The shocking truth behind Teddy's investigation is a psychological mind bender. The plot is thrilling, creepy, intense, inventive, sublime, violent, dark, ingenious and has a cathartic ending. There are many memorable scenes filled with symbolism. There are also many profound quotes in the film none better than in the last scene when Teddy asks, 'Which would be worse, to live as a monster or to die as a good man?'. That scene confused many film goers due to it's ambiguity. This viewer's opinion is the investigation is starting all over again and the revelations at the lighthouse proved to be ineffective. It may have helped that I read the novel. In fact I've read all of Lehane's novels many of which have been adapted to film. Scorsese has proven he is one of the best directors in all genre of film. To date this is his masterpiece for this genre.",9,0,2,6 May 2019
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick's Commentary On War
","Kubrick has created a virtuous war movie. Excellent direction, screenplay, editing, score, settings and acting. All of the actors deliver great performances with Modine, Ermey and D'Onofrio giving the most mezmorizing. The plot revolves around the Vietnam War and follows recruits through basic training and ultimately into war. During basic training we see the most iconic Drill Sergeant ever to appear on film preparing and molding his recruits for war. He is also trying to weed out the weak for their own good. He finds his target and then unleashes the most horrific psychological and physical torment ever portrayed on film. It is very difficult to view without feeling remorse for the target and respect for the Drill Sergeant. After basic training the plot follows the main character nicknamed Joker which is appropriate. Joker understands the duplicity of man and the absurdity of war. He is sent into war as a journalist but in the end becomes a product of the violence and environment he is submerged in. After the Battle of Hue the platoon marches away from the battlefield singing in unison a song which this viewer believes Kubrick shot in order to convey his commentary on war and violence. The plot is dark, gritty, disturbing, violent and horrifying. This film has so many unforgettable scenes to this day. You'll also hear fans quote famous lines such as, ' Let me see your war face'. It is a masterful work of art and one of the most unique and insightful movies in it's genre.",9,0,0,5 May 2019
American Hustle," The Con Is On
","Based on true events from the 1970's Abscam case, this is an ingenious con movie and Russell's best film to date. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, editing, costume, soundtrack and acting. The entire cast are in top form. Bale, Adams, Cooper, Lawrence and Renner deliver outstanding performances with Renner offering the best of his career. Bale's method acting is unparalleled. The plot revolves around a conman, Irving Rosenfeld and conwomen, Sydney Prosser who are professional at short cons such as art forgery and loan sharking. They are apprehended and are recruited by FBI agent Richie DiMaso to bring down crooked politicians in order for immunity. The target is New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito. That is where the real fun and long con begins. Along the way Richie who fancies himself a hot shot is being seduced by Sydney and Irving's jealous and semi-psychotic wife Rosalyn is threatening to expose Irving's con without even knowing she is doing so. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film it's hard for this viewer to choose a favorite. If I had to pick two scenes first would be when Irving comes clean to family man Carmine whom he has truly befriended that he set him up. The second would be the look on Richie's face when the long con is revealed and he realizes he has just been hustled by the best. The film is witty, clever, insightful, duplicitous, blazing, ingenious and has a cathartic ending. It is a nearly flawless and mesmorizing film that keeps the viewer guessing throughout. Dramatization aside, it's truly amazing how intelligent and duplicit these professional gifted grifters were.",8,3,3,5 May 2019
Bird Box," A Decent Film If It Is Not Compared With Another Film With The Same Premise
","This is an edited review from one posted by this viewer over three months ago. At the time I gave this film a thumbs up, but I was not completely fair and did not offer the review in my complete format. This was because of having previously viewed Krasinski's, 'A Quite Place'. After writing hundreds of reviews this was the first time I can recall ever comparing two films directly. That is why it was unfair. This viewer has always treated films / series as individual works of art. Hence follows my review. Bier has helmed an exceptional thriller. Excellent direction, cinematography, screenplay, score and acting. All the artists involved deliver superlative performances. In particular Bullock and Malkovich stand out. The plot revolves around a women named Malorie who is independent, content with solitude and pregnant. Right from the beginning we learn that an ominous presence has created a world of madness, destruction and suicide. We learn that there is however a safe community from the presence that is accessible by river, but it is unwise to involve children in the trip. We then flash back to five years earlier when the chaos is just beginning around the world and then hits home. This ends up landing Malorie at the home of Douglas, who seems to know that danger is eminent. The plot then flashes back and forth between the trip down the river and the time spent at Douglas' home. Random individuals seek safety at the home, one being another pregnant women, and the individuals collectively determine that sight is the key to the presence driving people insane. As people come and go from the home danger always seems to follow and Douglas' self preservation is constantly being tested. On a blind trip to a supermarket an incident occurs which tips off Malorie to the fact that birds can sense when danger is near. Both Malorie and the other women deliver their children, a boy and a girl. Eventually a visitor arrives and Douglas' instincts are confirmed. This individual destroys the safe haven leaving only Malorie, the two children and Tom left. Some survivors of the presence have embraced it as beautiful and have become psychotic wanting all to experience the beauty. An encounter with these individuals leads to the film focused completely on the river, as now only Malorie and the two children known as boy and girl, and have been navigating at this point for nearly two days. During their journey the three remain blindfolded and carry a box with birds in it to warn them of the presence. Their travel down river includes an encounter with a psychotic embracer of the presence, gathering supplies, running into an obstacle which overturns their boat and finally the treacherous rapids which are a indicator that the safe community is just beyond if they can get past the rapids. The plot is crisp, unique, clever, thrilling, sublime, poetic and has a powerful ending. This is one of the best films Netflix has dropped. It is memorable and a magnificent film in it's genre.",7,1,2,23 May 2019
The Color of Money," Fast Eddie Vs. Vince
","Scorsese delivers a superior sequel to 1961's, 'The Hustler'. Excellent direction, cinematography, editing, screenplay, soundtrack and acting. All the actors deliver the goods. Newman and Cruise offer superb performances. The plot revolves around the return of 'Fast Eddie' Felson. This time around he meets a young brash pool player named Vince. Felson immediately recognizes the talent in Vince and perhaps sees himself in Vince. He takes Vince under his wing as a protege and starts teaching him the art of conning. The relationship starts out fine, but eventually Vince's cocky, rebellious and jealous attitude drives a wedge between the two. Vince goes on his own to do his thing and soon the two meet again at a World Class Pool Tournament. To Vince's surprise, Felson is back in the game this time legitimately. The plot is clever, funny, ingenious, gripping, insightful and has a cathartic ending. Newman finally won a much overdue Academy Award for Best Actor. This film is a phenomenal, sublime and a masterful work of art. It remains one of the very best in it's genre.",8,0,0,7 May 2019
The Revenant," Inarritu's Acheivement Will Be Hard To Duplicate
","Inarritu creates another masterful work of art. This film has excellent direction, cinematography, setting, editing, acting, score and screenplay. DiCaprio and Hardy are phenomenal. The plot revolves around a frontiersman who suffers severe injuries during a vicious bear attack. His hunting partner shoots his partner's son and kills him. After recovering from his wounds with some assistance the frontiersman, utilizing his legendary tracking and survival skills, hunts down his partner on his way back to civilization to seek vengeance for his partner's betrayal. The plot is intense, brutal, captivating, unparalleled, insightful and has a cathartic ending. It's a one of a kind film that is mesmorizing throughout the entirety without barely a word spoken. I've never seen anything like it before. The film does an outstanding job examining man's will to survive and scrutinizing how far human beings will go to enact vengeance. I doubt any artist will ever be able to duplicate or achieve what Inarritu has done. This film sticks with the viewer long after it's ending. Congratulations to DiCaprio for finally achieving a much deserved Best Actor Oscar which he should have won a few times over. It's one of the very best films ever in it's genre.",9,0,0,16 May 2019
The Shining," Shine On
","Kubrick has helmed one of the best horror films of all time. This film is a terrifying bravura work of art. Adapted from Stephen King's novel Kubrick and Johnson took some liberties penning the story, however it is the first time I enjoyed the film over the novel. The score adds to the creepy and petrifying tone of the film and could actually be considered a character in the limited cast. This film has outstanding direction, cinematography, screenplay, score, special effects, setting and acting. Nicholson and Duvall are superb portraying a horrifying character, Jack and horrified character, Wendy.

His job is to 'correct' Wendy and Danny. The plot is dark, ominous, eerie, disturbing, violent, horrifying, bone-chilling, bloody, spine-tingling, inventive, unique and has a cathartic ending. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film they still haunt this viewer's dreams. This viewer's favorite scene is when Wendy turns and looks into a mirror that shows the reflection of a mirror behind her which Danny had written redrum on. To this day fans of the film quote it's most famous line , 'Here's Johnny'. This is a masterful work of art and is one of the best, if not the best, film to hit the silver screen in it's genre in this viewer's opinion.",9,0,5,5 May 2019

American History X," 'People Look At Me And See My Brother', A History Lesson
","Kaye helms one of the best films exploring racism in recent memory. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, settings, cinematography, score and acting. The entire cast delivers exceptional performances. In particular Norton, Furlong, Brooks, Falk and Keach are superb. Norton commands the silver screen and his performance is absolutely mesmerizing. The plot revolves around a neo-Nazi, Derek and his younger brother, Danny. Danny is assigned the task of writing a paper on his beliefs by his school's guidance counselor, Dr. Sweeney after submitting a book report on, 'Mein Kampf'. Dr. Sweeney is the former teacher of Danny's brother Derek. As Danny sits at his computer to start the paper the story of his family's history begins. We find his brother Derek is a very intelligent neo-Nazi who spreads his hatred, propaganda and recruits for the local chapter leader Cameron. Derek is doing time for committing a heinous act of vengeance after his dead father's truck is stolen. During his time in jail Derek is subjected to a brutal assault and is visited by his former teacher. This experience opens his eyes as to why he embraced the neo-Nazis after a life growing up in an environment of violence, hate and racism. Upon his release Derek's mission is to save his family and change his brother's path while struggling with old associates and his own past. This leads to a confrontation with Cameron and a equally eye opening story he tells Danny.

After his reunion with his brother, Danny's report starts off as, 'People look at me and see my brother'. If only that was not the case, but sometimes it takes tragic events to see things differently, change one's beliefs, end the violence and alter one's future. This remains one of the very best modern day films probing racism and violence. It is a sublime and brilliant work of art in it's genre.",9,1,1,10 May 2019
No Country for Old Men," Ambiguity And The Dreams
","While reviewing a movie on IMDb I couldn't remember if I had reviewed this film. I clicked on audience reviews and was shocked by the number of reviews panning the film almost entirely because of the ambiguity of the ending. Which is fine. Everyone is entitled to an opinion. I never suggest whether to view a movie or not. This applies even when I believe a bravura film has been made. I leave it up to the reader whether they choose to view it or not. Of the four movies adapted from McCarthy's novels, which this viewer has read every one of, this film follows the novel almost to a tee. This film won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay. I'll admit I was ambivalent about the ending, but this is a virtuous film. The Coens have ended films cryptically before. In 'Raising Arizona' H.I. is laying in bed awake and part of his monologue is, ' This whole dream, was it wishful thinking? Was I just fleeing reality like I know I'm liable to do. But me and Ed, we can be good too. And it seemed real'. It leaves the ending open for interpretation. I'll review the plot direct, I won't provide analysis, I won't address all of the symbolism and I won't examine it as thoroughly as I normally would. The ending is what I'd like to offer an opinion on. This film has astounding direction, cinematography, screenplay, settings, score and acting. The storyline follows Llewelyn finding a case full of cash from a drug deal gone awry and stealing it. This ignites a pursuit of Llewelyn being hunted by the cartel, a psychopathic bounty hunter named Chigurh who embodies evil, another bounty hunter named Carson and Sheriff Bell. During the entire film Llewelyn is able prove to be a worthy adversary for his main pursuer Chigurh. We find out Llewelyn served two tours in Vietnam which might be indicative of his survival skills. We learn from Carson that Chigurh always gets his man and that Chigurh has principles that transcend money or drugs or anything else. Bell is in pursuit to save Llewelyn from death. With Chigurh, a person's life hangs in the balance by the toss of a coin. The toss of the coin has modeled Chigurh as a force of random death. The pursuit is full of action, duplicity and killings. In the end it is only Chigurh and Bell left. To address the ending I do have to spoil one part of the film which I never do in a review. So be warned. Llewelyn is found dead in a motel room and the cash is gone. All we see is a group of men speeding out of the parking lot. We don't know who killed Llewelyn, but we do know it wasn't Chigurh. Llewelyn wasn't a classic western hero. He stole the cash. The point is that the odds caught up with him. In old westerns the hero always strolls off into the sunset. The Coens are known for a pessimistic world view. Chigurh visits Llewelyn's wife Carla Jean to fulfill his promise to kill her. After a brief exchange he explains the best he can do is offer a toss of the coin. We see him leave. Does it matter if Carla Jean is killed? Whether Chigurh has free will or not, the coin was tossed. Chigurh is sideswiped and severely injured in the crash but walks away. This is symbolic of his very own coin toss. The coin represents forces beyond our control. My interpretation of the dreams. Bell is having breakfast with his wife Loretta explaining dreams he had the previous night. In the first dream Bell's father gives him money, but he can't remember what he did with it. This symbolizes youth living in the moment and not thinking about the future. In the second dream his father is carrying a flame in a horn like people used to do. The flame symbolizes the values and integrity of the old west and old sheriffs. Bell then says, 'And then I woke up'. Cut to black. This symbolizes the world he believed in probably never existed, it was an illusion and he just realizes it. He understands that today's world is no country for old men. No matter what one's interpretation of the ending and the dreams this film is sublime, ingenious and an avant-garde modern day western. It's yet to be surpassed.",9,1,1,10 May 2019
Django Unchained," Unchained & Blood Soaked, Tarantino Tackles Westerns
","Tarantino is back in form with his ultraviolent blaxploitation drama. It is his first time delving into the Western genre and as usual he succeeds with boldness and brilliance. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, score and acting. The visual landscapes are outstanding. All actors involved deliver superlative performances. In particular DiCaprio, Waltz, Goggins, Foxx, Washington and Jackson are superb. The plot is set pre - Civil War and revolves around a recently freed slave named Django. He is freed, sort of, by a seasoned and cunning bounty hunter named Dr. Schultz. The two initially set out to capture three vicious and murderous brothers and are successful. The duo then continues to hunt bounties throughout the South. Eventually they land at the infamous plantation Candieland. Calvin Candie is a sinister racist that passes his time by holding 'Mandingo Fights' in which two slaves face off in wrestling matches until the death with betting involved. Once there they find Django's long lost wife Broomhilda which has been Django's goal all along. This is when the cat-n-mouse and war of wills begins to rescue her. Calvin's house slave Stephen overhears a deal negotiated by Schutlz and puts a kibosh on the deal. This results in a duplicitous shootout with two main characters being dispatched. Django is captured, tortured and is removed from Candieland but through some chicanery he convinces the henchmen that are taking him away to return him to Candieland with the offer of great rewards. Once back at Candieland all hell breaks loose as everyone involved learns that Django is not a man to be trifled with. The plot is clever, funny, brutal, violent, unique, cathartic and has a bombastic ending. The film examines the obvious theme of racism. It also explores other themes such as just because Django is freed from his chains is his soul truly free and another is the scrutinizing of greed and power. This is a memorable and captivating film. To this day you'll hear fans of the film quote famous lines such as Django's, 'I like the way you die boy'. It ranks up with Tarantino's best and one of the very best in it's genre.",8,0,2,10 May 2019

This ultimately puts Brasco in a life and death choice between doing his job or honoring his friendship.

This film is outstanding in scrutinizing the lines that get blurred between friendship and justice when a human being is forced to live two separate identities. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film. My favorite scene is when Lefty is telling his wife he is heading out To meet someone and he leaves all his jewelry behind. To this day you'll hear fans quote lines such as, 'I never said you were a rat. You's my best friend'. This is a a timeless classic and one of the very best in it's genre.",8,0,0,16 May 2019
Evil Dead," Alvarez's Reawakening

Excellent direction, screenplay, special effects, cinematography, settings, score and acting. All of the actors involved offer gifted and truly frightening performances. This time around five friends visit a cabin in the woods to detox Mia. Along with Mia are her brother David, Eric, Natalie and Olivia. Soon the 'Book of The Dead' is discovered in the cabin's cellar.

Eric continues to try to reverse his actions and figure out what has happened. He believes killing Mia is the solution. This film is much more gory than the original and lacks the quirky and outlandish vibe, but at times odes to the original are referenced. Nonetheless this film works.The plot is horrific, creepy, disquieting, grisly, brutal, thrilling, bone-chilling, ferocious, gory and has a sublime ending. This film is part of 'The Evil Dead' franchise and this viewer sees it as a re-imagination for newcomers to enjoy if sleepless nights are your thing. There is also an interpretation presented for a possible sequel, which would be welcomed if it can stand up to this caliber of horror. It is a terrifying experience, memorable and at the very top in it's genre.",7,0,2,8 May 2019

","Leone helms a virtuous epic film in the crime / drama genre. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, editing, cinematography, score and acting. There are many famous artists involved in this film and they deliver superlative and realistic performances. De Niro and Woods in particular are superb. The plot revolves around a former gangster, Noodles, who returns to New York after disappearing four decades earlier to start a new life and for other reasons. The plot initially hints as to why Noodles left New York, but after his return we learn the entire story as seen through his own flashbacks. We see Noodles and his friends growing up in a Jewish slum in New York's Lower East Side. Noodles, a natural leader, rises to bootlegger and ultimately a Mafia boss. This does not come without violence, betrayal and remorse. The film does a magnificent job examining all of the characters and what makes them tick. The plot is gripping, intense, violent, gritty, bloody, duplicitous and has a cathartic ending. This is a sprawling story and thus turns into a lengthy and entertaining film which Leone is known for to begin with. It is a masterful work of art, memorable, timeless and a classic. This film takes a different path, as far as the storyline, than most traditional gangster films which is refreshing. This viewer has revisited this film many times and in my opinion it is bravura in it's genre and holds it's own with the other celebrated gangster / mob films.",8,1,8,8 May 2019

Now considered by many as a cult classic, little did fans know this was the beginning of a stellar and unparalleled career.

Pulp Fiction," I'll Tell Ya What Was In That Suitcase
","Tarantino's second feature film is one of the very best crime dramas ever. It is also one of the most quoted, hippest and pop culture favorite films. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, soundtrack, settings and acting. All the actors involved deliver perfect pulp magazine performances. In particular Travolta, Thurman and Jackson stand out. Travolta and Jackson's philosophical discussion scenes are pure hilarity. Travolta and Thurman's dance scene is unforgettable. The plot revolves around two hit man whose main storyline is interwoven with their gangster boss, the boss' actress wife, a struggling boxer, a fixer and two armed robbers. All the characters stories are perfectly constructed and come full circle. The plot is intense, clever, funny, gritty, violent, gripping, has twists and is unparalleled. The word pulp is derived from cheap wood paper on which Pulp Magazines, also known as Pulps, were printed. This film is like a Pulps in a different medium. To this day fans of this film memorized and can quote Jackson's, 'Ezekiel 25:17' in it's entirety. One of the biggest mysteries in the film is what is in the suitcase? There have been many theories. This viewer's theory is as simple as a Pulps. I believe it was Taratino indicating that there was gold, as in the form of a certain award, that was emitting the glow. This film is memorable and remains one of the very best and most unique in it's genre.",9,0,1,10 May 2019
The Untouchables," Untouchable In It's Genre
","I just revisited this film after having viewed it many times over. Not to date myself but I saw it premier in theaters when I was 17 years old. In this viewer's opinion it remains De Palma's best gangster crime drama, although it was a tough choice considering, 'Scarface' and 'Carlito's Way'. This film has outstanding direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, score and acting. The ensemble cast includes artists such as Costner, Connery, De Niro, Garcia, Smith, Clarkson, Drago and Kehoe. The entire cast including the supporting cast deliver superb performances. However it is Costner, Connery, Garcia and De Niro who command the screen. De Niro even uses his method acting which he is liable to do. The film starts off blazing with Al Capone surrounded by his henchmen trying to reason with reporters why people are going to do what they want to do and he is simply responding to their will as an honest businessman. The plot is set during the late 1920's Prohibition and revolves around Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness who is assigned the task of taking down Capone, the mob kingpin of the entire city of Chicago. Ness is leading a special task force and is as straight as a shooter, pun intended, as they come. He immediately encounters corruption within his task force which forces him to go outside to find his own team. In steps Jimmy Malone who is an Irish-American veteran beat cop and is reluctant to join Ness at first. He agrees to work with Ness if he will let him do things his way which sometimes means thinking and acting like a criminal. Next is George Stone who is a hot tempered Italian-American sharp shooter straight out of the academy. Ness next consults with U.S. Treasury Agent Oscar Wallace who determines the best way to nab Capone is through tax evasion as he has not filed an income tax return for several years. Ness encounters more corruption when he is offered a bribe to drop the case against Capone as he is feeling the loss of income and heat from Ness. Capone dispatches his hitman Frank Nitti to threaten Ness' family in another attempt to back off. During a raid to intercept a liquor shipment at the Canadian - U.S. border the team captures Capone's bookkeeper George. Jimmy slyly hoodwinks a brisk agreement from George to cooperate with the investigation. Wallace and George are heading to a safe house, but encounter Nitti dressed as a cop and do not make it. Jimmy intuitively knows the Chief of Police Dorsett sold Wallace and George out to Nitti. He confronts Dorsett and beats the location of Capone's chief bookkeeper Walter Payne out of him. Later that night Jimmy is ambushed by Nitti and is bullet ridden by a Tommy gun. Before he passes Jimmy is able to inform Ness of Walter's plan to leave town. Walter eventually testifies in court about Capone's untaxed income, but it takes some chicanery on Ness' part to make things happen. The judge won't accept evidence of jury tampering and right before the judge is going to claim a mistrial Ness implies that there are many powerful politician's names in the bookkeeping ledger showing payoffs by Capone. This prompts the judge to immediately switch the current jury for a jury in an adjacent courtroom. The plot is thrilling, clever, intelligent, action packed, ingenious, cathartic, duplicitous, gritty, poetic and has a liberating end. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film. My favorite scene is when Ness confronts Capone in his hotel lobby over the killings of Wallace and George. It is an intense scene. My favorite quotes are from a scene where Ness and Nitti are on a rooftop after Ness is aware that it was Nitti who murdered Jimmy. Nitti says to Ness, 'You're friend squealed like a stuck Irish pig'. Ness tosses him from the rooftop and yells, 'Did he sound anything like that?'. It is a riveting exchange. This film has sublime direction by De Palma shot in his signature format and is bravura in it's genre. It remains a timeless classic.",8,2,5,5 May 2019
The Departed," An Adaptation Of 'Infernal Affairs' Finally Wins Scrosese An Oscar? The Clueless Academy
","'Infernal Affairs' is a superb film and so is this ingenious remake. I didn't think Scorsese could top two of his previous gangster masterpieces, 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' but he has. This film has superlative performances by all the actors involved. The plot revolves around two moles, one who infiltrates South Boston's well known criminal organization and the other who infiltrates the police investigating the organization. Once it becomes known by both sides that these moles exist the cat and mouse fight for survival between the two begins. For years Scorsese worked with DeNiro which earned him a Best Actor Award for 'Raging Bull'. However Scorsese has been continuously snubbed for a Best Director and Best Picture Award which he has deserved many times over. Recently he has taken DeCaprio, an excellent artist, under his wing and finally the favor was returned. At last Scorsese has been rewarded for bringing out the best performances from his actors. This film does an outstanding job examining the mobster lifestyle, authority, politics and corruption. This film has masterful acting, directing, cinematography, editing and screenplay. It is one of the finest in it's genre and a bravura film by Scorsese. Bravo Academy! You finally got it right.",9,3,5,16 May 2019
Psycho," He Wouldn't Even Hurt A Fly
","Hitchcock's best film. A masterpiece of it's genre. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, score and acting. The plot revolves around a secretary who steals are large sum of money and hits the road on the lamb. She avoids police by taking back roads which lands her at the run down Bates Motel. Once there she encounters the curiously weird proprietor Norman. From that point the thrills and chills begin. The plot is chilling, creepy, dark, horrific and has a one of a kind fantastic twist ending. The film has many creepy scenes and the shower scene is still spine tingling and timeless. Anthony Perkin's stare and monologue at the end of the film is ingrained in my memory decades after I first started back into it. Both remain two of the most horrific moments ever captured on film. This is a masterful work of art and still evokes screams and terrible dreams from first time viewers. It remains one of the very best films ever in it's genre.",9,1,1,8 May 2019
Crazy Heart," Bridges Best Since Lebowski
","Cooper has helmed a masterpiece. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, editing, acting and soundtrack. Bridges, Duvall, Gyllenhaal and Farrell deliver top notch performances. Bridges was born to play this character and delivers one of the finest portrayals of his career. He delivers a sensational emotive performance and was finally awarded a long overdue Oscar for Best Actor. The plot revolves around a former country music star, Bad Blake who has now become the proverbial down on his luck alcoholic. He is reduced to playing gigs half wasted in seedy joints across the country. Eventually he runs into a reporter, Jean Craddock in one of the towns he stops in who has an interest in his life story. That interest eventually blooms into a love interest on both ends. Eventually sobering up the singer is on the rise again and comes to a crossroads in his life. He is given an opportunity by his once protege Tommy Sweet. The plot is surreal, intense, realistic, heart wrenching, redeeming and has a cathartic ending. The film examines relationships and at what cost redemption can be achieved. It almost questions whether the cost and sacrifice is worth absolution. The love story along with the accompanying music is one for the ages. This is a true work of art. I look forward to Cooper's next effort. This film is at the very top in the drama genre.",8,0,0,24 May 2019
There Will Be Blood," Black Gold, 'Oil' That Is
","Anderson creates another masterful drama and does Upton Sinclair's novel, 'Oil' justice. This film has excellent direction, score, cinematography, screenplay, editing and acting. The entire cast deliver superb performances. Day-Lewis and Dano are sensational. The plot revolves around a former silver miner, Daniel Plainview turned ruthless oil baron. Plainview adopts a son H.W. to project a family man image but more importantly to help him in the conning of local landowners who don't realize the value of the property they own. When a local preacher Eli Sunday becomes suspicious of the oil man, a life long battle ensues which threatens each man's life. Day-Lewis creates one of the most cunning, vicious and hateful villains ever on film. The film does an outstanding job examining the affects of greed and power. Is wealth the key to a fulfilled life or is it the key to a self absorbed life and insanity? The film also scrutinizes family dynamics within the Plainviews. The plot is dark, clever, psychological, unique, violent, insightful, harrowing and has a brutally duplicitous ending. This is one of Anderson's top three films and is an ingenious film in it's genre.",8,0,0,9 May 2019
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," High Flying
","Forman has helmed some great films over the years, but this remains his masterpiece and one of the greatest in the dramedy genre. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, setting, score and acting. All the actors deliver powerhouse performances. In fact many of the actors spent time in a mental institution to get a feel for the real conditions and treatment of patients at the time. Nicholson, Fletcher and Dourif command the screen. The plot revolves around a prison inmate, McMurphy, who feigns anti-social behavior in order to serve out his time in a mental institution. During his initial evaluation he describes despicable and irreprehensible acts he's committed that prompt the doctor to commit him for further evaluation.

He views her treatment of patients as inhumane through abuse, cruelty, medications and electroconvulsive therapy. That battle of wills begins here. McMurphy decides to practice his own therapy on patients by treating them as human beings as opposed to being castaways from society. Ratched is relentless in her treatment methods. This battle ultimately ends in one of the most disturbing and poetic endings in film history. The plot is flawless, clever, funny, dark, disturbing, violent, unique and cathartic. This remains one of the most memorable and sublime films of all time. This film is a virtuous work of art.",9,1,1,5 May 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," Greedy Wolf
","Arguably one of Scorsese's best to date. The film examines individuals consumed by the want of money and the richness it brings. In this case the richness that is depleted from humanity. DiCaprio portays the most narcissistic character this viewer has ever witnessed on the silver screen. It's astonishing that it's based on true events. The film tells the story of Jordan Belfort who starts his own brokerage firm and bilks his investors out of millions of dollars with an idea that started with penny stocks. He starts the firm with his cronies that follow him from his beginning and their loyalty is unflappable. This proves to be crucial when Belfort's rags to riches meteoric rise catches the eye of a dogged SEC agent. He is on to Belfort and is hell bent on taking him down. While Belfort's lifestyle of debauchery and belief of being untouchable continues the agent is closing in. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film it is virtually impossible to pick a favorite. Excellent direction, screenplay, soundtrack, cinematography, costume, editing and acting. All of the artists involved deliver superlative performances. DiCaprio, Hill, Chandler and Robbie stand out. However it is DiCaprio who is commanding and mesmerizing. The plot is outrageous, uproarious, insightful, explorative, ingenious, sublime, intelligent, duplicitous, captivating, poetic and has a cathartic ending. To this day you'll hear fans of this film quote such famous lines as Belfort's, 'Sell me this pen'. This a a timeless masterpiece and remains one of the very best in it's genre.",9,0,2,7 May 2019
Inception," Nolan Is An Architect
","Nolan helms and pens a sublime science fiction thriller. This film has outstanding direction, cinematography, screenplay, settings, score and acting. The score plays just as an important role as the characters as it creates a thrilling and intense tone to the film. All of the artists involved deliver superlative performances. In particular Page, Gordon-Levity, Murphy, Hardy, Watanabe, Cotillard and Caine are superb. However it is DiCaprio who commands the screen. The plot is so complex, but I'll try to sum it up concisely keeping in mind I'll be leaving out intricate details. A powerful Japanese business man Saito wants an idea planted in the mind of the heir, Robert, to his competitor's energy conglomerate so that Robert will dissolve the company when he takes over control. Saito bribes Cobb who is an extractor to do the job. Typically an extractor is part of a team that performs corporate espionage by infiltrating the subconscious through a shared dream world and then stealing valuable information. Basically they are thieves for hire. Cobb has a criminal past which prevents him from entering the U.S. to see his children which Saito can fix with his powerful influence, so Cobb accepts the job. Cobb and his partner Arthur enlist the help of a conman Eames, a chemist Yusef who creates a sedative to create a stable dreamworld and Ariande who is an architect that builds the puzzle of the dream's landscape. In order to wake up from a dream a member from the team must stay behind at each level to set up a kick which awakens the remaining sleeping members. If a dreamer does not wake up from the kick they are stuck in Limbo which is nearly impossible to escape from and the dreamer doesn't even realize they are still in a dream. A dreamer has an object called a totem which distinguishes the dream world from reality. Cobb and his team are going to try to do what has never been done before successfully. Plant an idea in Robert's mind during a 10 hour flight which requires planting an idea by invading a dream within a dream within a dream. This will also require a simultaneous kick to awaken the team members from the multi-level dream at the same time. Cobb reveals that he and his wife Mal had been stuck in Limbo when first experimenting with dream technology and built a world which she refused to leave and come back to reality. She is stuck in Cobb's mind as a projection. The team is pulling off the mission with Mal attempting to subterfuge it at every angle. Saito ends up getting injured and death in a dream results in Limbo. The team members all awake from the simultaneous kick except for Cobb who stays behind to find an aged Saito. He uses his totem to remind Saito of their agreement. The plot is intense, thrilling, mind-blowing, intelligent, duplicitous, ingenious, cathartic and has an ambiguous ending. I had to watch this mind- bending labyrinth film a few times to truly understand and appreciate it's brilliance. In this viewer's opinion it is Nolan's masterpiece and is at the very top if not the best film in it's genre.",9,0,1,6 May 2019
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Wes' Idiosyncrasies Animated
","Not since 'Bottle Rocket', 'Rushmore' and 'The Royal Tenenbaums' have I enjoyed Anderson's work. The animation is captivating. The plot revolves around a fox who breaks a promise to his wife and continues to raid three local farmers for chickens because it's his natural instinct. The farmers decide to unite and put an end to the culprit once and for all which endangers the fox's family and friends. At this point the fox's natural instinct for survival kicks in and he cleverly sets out a plan to save his loved ones. This movie is clever, witty, quirky, heartwarming and insightful. It contains all of Anderson's idiosyncrasies. I believe Anderson is asking why do we act on some of our natural human instincts? Why can't we resist and be willing to change? I do enjoy all of his works, this is a fun filled joy ride and ranks at the top of his masterful artwork.",8,0,1,6 May 2019
Heat," Diner Scene
","This is Mann's best film and one of the greatest crime dramas to date. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, editing, score and acting. The entire cast delivers the goods. In particular De Niro, Pacino, Kilmer, Judd and Voight are superb. The buzz around this film was that it would be the first time that two icons of Hollywood, De Niro and Pacino would appear on screen at the same time and they don't disappoint. The plot revolves around master thief Neil McCauley and Lt. Hanna. Neil is trying to deal with the consequences of a heist gone wrong due to the actions of a last minute add on to his crew. He is trying to hunt down this rogue member who has gone off the grid while at the same time planning to pull off one last heist before retiring from his profession. He is also trying to simultaneously deal with issues occurring in the life of his most trusted member Chris Shererlis. While this is going on Lt. Hanna is on to Neil and his crew and is hell bent on taking him down. Lt. Hanna is also dealing with his own personal issues with his wife and stepdaughter. Neil and Lt. Hanna meet at a diner and over a cup of coffee make it very clear that they are the best at what they do and no matter what it comes down to one or the other is going to lose. This conversation creates a bond and mutual respect between the two but does not prevent either from going through with their plans and promise. The plot is clever, intense, violent, intelligent, thrilling, action packed and has a poetic ending. There are many memorable scenes in this film, none more mesmorizing than the diner scene. When Neil and Lt. Hanna claim to be the best at what they do, it is symbolic of De Niro and Pacino. There are also many memorable quotes such as Neil's, 'Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner'. This proves to be vital and crucial advice. This is an unparalleled film in it's genre and has yet to be surpassed at this time.",9,0,0,5 May 2019

The plot revolves around a U.S. Army absconder living a peaceful existence on a small island in the South Pacific. He is discovered by his commanding officer and forced back into training for the Battle Of Guadalcanal. From that point perspectives of various U.S. troops are explored as far as their attitudes towards life, death and war. The plot is gritty, violent, emotional, insightful, thought provoking, memorable, captivating and poetic. This film impacted my life and philosophy. I've revisited this masterpiece many times and it always reinvigorates my belief in humanity. This is Malick's best in this viewer's mind, although 'Badlands' could be argued. It is certainly the best commentary on war and humanity ever made.",9,1,2,5 May 2019

Based on a true story, the plot revolves around Dr. Don Shirley who is an African American prodigy pianist. By his own choice Shirley decides to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South during 1962. Knowing he will need protection, Shirley hires Tony Lip whose reputation as a fast talking, tough bouncer proceeds himself. Lip is an Italian American who resides in the Bronx and is currently unemployed due to renovations at the Copacabana. So as fate has it, the two men from completely different sides of the proverbial spectrum start a unique road trip. Despite their differences in culture and ethnicity, which is revealed through their constant banter and time spent alone together, the men form a special bond. This all occurs while the two men face danger and racism during an era of segregation. The plot is clever, crisp, insightful, thought provoking, heartwrenching, heartwarming and has a wonderful ending. There are many memorable scenes and quotes in this film. Lip's quote, 'Don't worry 'bout it. I been working nightclubs in New York City my whole life. I know it's a complicated world.' rings true today. That is what adds to making this an eventual timeless and classic work of art, which is symbolic of the friendship that was formed.",9,1,3,17 May 2019
Pineapple Express," Item 9, ILLEGAL!
","David Gordon Green has proven his ability to direct an array of films in different genres such as drama, horror and comedy. The latter applies here. Green helms an exceptional comedy. It certainly helps to have Rogen and Goldberg pen the screenplay. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, special effects, soundtrack and acting. I don't recall hearing Eddy Grant's, 'Electric Avenue' being played on the radio as much as it did in the early 80's after this film was released. This film has a plethora of comedic artists as cast members who all deliver splendid performances. In particular Rogen, Franco, Robinson, Heard, Cole, Hader, McBride and Corrigan stand out. As a matter of fact the entire cast is spot on in their timing, delivery and portrayals. The plot revolves around a stoner process servicer, Dale and his weed dealing stoner best friend, Saul. Dale has to serve papers to Saul's dealer and witnesses the dealer murder his competitor. Dale leaves behind evidence that the dealer immediately recognizes as Pineapple Express. This ignites Dale and Saul running for their lives while being pursued by assassins and corrupt police. The plot is hysterical, violent, riotous, action packed, boisterous, vivacious and has a rib-tickling ending. There are many hilarious scenes in this film. Some of the scenes are when underground military secret testing on marijuana with Private Miller takes place; when Saul explains the evolution of Pineapple Express and the engineering of the cross-joint; the fight at Red's apartment; Saul's chase with the police in hot pursuit; the bombastic fully loaded explosive showdown and the breakfast at the diner. There are also many side-splitting quotes in the film. To this day you'll hear fans of the film quote Dale saying, 'You've been served' or General Bratt screaming, 'We have a final decision on Item 9. ILLEGAL!'. The film is like an embodiment of the peaceful counterculture meets the violent underworld. This is a loveable, memorable and sublime comedy that is a treat to view stoned or not.",7,0,0,10 May 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Hands Down The Best In The Star Wars Saga To This Day
","Any 'Star Wars' fan will tell you this film is hands down the best in the saga. Kershner and Kasden created a masterpiece. The direction, cinematography, screenplay, special effects, score and acting are superlative. The score plays just as an important role as the characters as it adds to the intensity, and adventurous tone of the film. The story continues between the rebel forces and the evil empire. Luke is introduced to Yoda who tutors him in the way of the Jedi. The rebel forces are in immenent danger and Luke cuts his training short to join the rebels in their battle. He encounters the ominous Darth Vader and family secrets are finally revealed. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film it is almost impossible to choose a favorite. If I had to it would be the scene where Luke must decide on accepting the truth or risk plunging to his death. The plot is crisp, insightful, duplicitous, thrilling, cathartic and has an ambiguous ending. It is an ingenious film and remains one of the very best films in the science fiction genre. This film influenced this viewer to remain a fan even after having to endure the inferior Episodes 1, 2 and 3.",9,0,0,16 May 2019
The Breakfast Club," Wake Up To The Brilliance of Hughes
","I'm perplexed by this film being panned by so many. I'm going to give a brief background on Hughes, scenarios that came to mind regarding the negative feedback and then a brief analysis of the film. Hughes was one of the most influential writers / directors of his time. He was the master in the coming of age dramedy genre. His films were often referred to as, that's a John Hughes film. The title wasn't necessary. That's influence. This is my opinion and that's why I never suggest or not suggest that a reader 'Must See' a film. I leave it up to the reader. Who I am do decide whether a person watch a film or not. That's being somewhat narcissistic. That's a stereotype. This applies even when I feel a bravura film has been created. There are many scenarios I thought of which could explain the negative reviews . I'll list three. 1) The viewer lacks cognition, intelligence or wait I've got it a lack of a brain 2) The viewer doesn't enjoy the genre, therefor shouldn't have watched the film and shouldn't deprive others of enjoyment by declaring 'Don't Watch It'. 3) The viewer lacks self esteem, seeks attention and blasts out a brief review with no analysis in order to be the center of attention. That viewer has been stereotyped and could have been a character in 'The Breakfast Club'. Get it? I'm not trying to be insulting. I'm trying to convey my opinion with humor and straightforwardness much like Hughes did in his films. This film has resonated with viewers for over three decades so I can't think of a legitimate reason why a Gen-X (that's me) or any other generation can't relate to this film. The stereotyping in this film, unfortunately still occurs to this day. I participated in an actual Breakfast Club every Sunday morning which included a stoner, a jock, a delinquent (that's me again), a nerd and so on. The point is this film changed our philosophy and all were welcome. Now that's influence! I'm not going to go into a thorough examination of the film as it's message is laid out flat in your face, which Hughes was liable to do, and would be an insult to the intelligence. It doesn't take a Tesla-minded person to figure out the film's theme. There's another stereotype for you. The film. Five completely different individuals are forced to spend an entire Saturday together in a library due to detention. Were it not for that, these five wouldn't have blinked an eye at each other in the hallways for fear of association. The five are assigned an essay by Principle Vernon to describe who they are. Vernon is a biased and jaded character. One of the five, Bender, gives a blazing speech imitating what life at home must be like for each of the characters. This ignites a spark which causes the five to start thinking. They spend the day together hoodwinking Vernon and enjoying each other's company. The five eventually open up to each other, learn about each other, realize they all have similarities and forge a bond. At the end of the day they go their separate ways which is ambiguous and leave a single essay for Vernon. Vernon reads the essay which is narrated to the viewer by all five. It sums up the entire movie in a straightforward manner. The narration follows, ' Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever we did wrong. But we think your crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see us. In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each of us is a brain and an athlete and a basket case and a princess and a criminal. Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, The Breakfast Club.' This viewer imagines the five continuing to be friends even in the hallways of high school. This is a rare film that can make a real life change. It is sublime, virtuous, timeless and is Hughes' best coming of age dramedies and one of the most significant in it's genre, if not the greatest of all time. This review is my opinion which is what a review is essentially. Sincerely yours, a member of The Breakfast Club.",9,1,1,5 May 2019
