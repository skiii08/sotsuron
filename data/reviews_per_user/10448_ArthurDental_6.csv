The Devil's Advocate," over-rated religious tale
","No doubt the performances by the three leading actors are magnificent. But the film ultimately proves a vacuous morality tale that's as clich√©d and stereotypical as they come. Right, Manhattan's the devil's playground, and money and sex are so tempting, a man risks losing his soul. Really, if someone needs to know the Bible - or worse, this film - to know Kevin Lomax was veering off the path of goodness, as some of the comments here implies, they need to look at themselves and figure out where they lost their conscience.Oh, and the movie tempts you with some of the very same things 'John Milton' used to tempt Lomax. Try to figure out what.",6,1,2,5 March 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Good and Bad
","I'm talking about the movie, not the characters. Since we've seen the results in the original trilogy, I didn't think there would be much suspense, as in the Phantom Menace. I was surprised.I can't give out the details here, but from political intrigue to romantic subplot, Lucas partly redeemed himself by blending multiple story lines just like in Empire Strikes Back. What let this movie down, though, is the slow pace in many of the scenes. I especially detest the long race sequences. First few seconds, it was cool, but it gets old very fast, and I'm surprised anyone would like sitting minutes watching the same maneuvers over and over again. The action scenes were good, and the long wait is what made them even better. You learn so much about the characters.Still, there's one more fault: Lucas is not a good writer when dealing with the 'mundane.' The initial scene between Anakin and Padme when the met again was so cheesy. Anakin has a habit of blurting out his feelings instead of letting us see him in action. This unsophisticated storytelling ruined a few scenes as a result.This is a movie no Star Wars fan should miss. Then again, Lucas could have done a much better job, and we wouldn't have had to sit two and a half hours. It could easily have been a 100-min  enrapturing blockbuster.",8,0,0,16 May 2002
Ex Machina," This movie is not about AI
","Yes, the dialog is a bit stilted but not as revelatory as you may expect. But once you realize what the film is really about, everything will make sense, and the ending that leaves so many viewers dissatisfy will turn out to be far more perfect, and far more twisted, than they realized. How much you understand this film depends on how gender biased you are. There's an excellent explanation of the film (with SPOILERS, of course) on Quora dot com that you can easily find through your favorite search engine (). But you will SPOIL the whole film if you read it before watching the movie.",9,0,2,27 August 2017
Pi," For people who don't know math or science
","* warning: mild spoilers *While intellectually this film is actually beyond the normal Hollywood fare (because it's not from Hollywood), most of the people who find beauty or truth or whatever in this movie reflects on the poverty of math and science education in America (and possibly elsewhere). Here are a few things that show why.1. Patterns are everywhere because there's no fixed set of patterns. And it's a reflection 'after the fact.' In other words, you can find patterns everywhere but they are by definition a reflection of what has happened. The movie mentions it but drops it in favor of some theological meaning. That's fine for the movie's purpose; otherwise there'd be no story. But to think that's true in life would be a big mistake.2. Pi takes the conventional wisdom especially from religions: that humans can't understand and thus be 'god' without bad things happening. This is why at the end the genius destroys his own ingenuity and becomes happy as an average guy. 'Ignorance is bliss,' so the Church once told its believers. Most people still seem to accept it today.3. For those who scoff at 216, it's actually a very long number. There are virtually 10^26 permutations (the Hasidics said it's a 216-word name), since every digit can be anything from 0 to 10. That's 100 TRILLION TRILLION [sic] possibilities, so when Max said the Jews had tried all of them but couldn't understand 'the context,' it's wrong.Things like these should be apparent to anyone who's taken the advanced math classes in high school. Few movies treat science with the respect it deserves, and though this one is respectful it still uses the cliches against it. That so many people find this picture deep shows that science and math are pathetic subjects in American schools.",5,17,28,22 December 2002
Casualties of War," Happy ending not worth it
","I think this film tries too hard not to leave audience down, so Fox is made too innocent simply by being so isolated, and the ending a bit forced. It'd be much more impactful if reality were portrayed. I don't want to give a history lesson, but only one incident, the infamous My Lai, brought a trial (basically a village was savaged and massacred). And when the American public learned about it, they were furious - at the sight of our boys on trial. So despite the military looking likely to mete out punishments, Nixon applied pressure and everyone was let go. If this film took on that reality, it'd be a more hard-hitting film.",7,1,1,14 December 2002
The Graduate," Overrated
","I don't know if critics have a different sense of humor, but I really don't know how some films are classified 'comedies.' Take this film. There were two or three laughing-out-loud scenes, but that's it. At best it's a drama that, as a few others have pointed out, starts off brilliantly but fades out about a third of the way through. The problem is the ending, and what led to it, was inexplicable and cliched. Ben and Elaine had just a date, half of it probably wasted by Ben's cruel behaviors, before he decided he wants to get married. Despite Mrs. Robinson's warning against his going out with her daughter, I don't see how Ben's feeling for the her just dropped out of the picture. Well, actually, the moral is that when the man finds what he can have, he can and should go after it.That's the bigger problem with 'The Graduate.' I don't like being a morality cop but this films suddenly turned Mrs. Robinson out to be the villain, whereas Ben's role in the destruction of the Robinsons' family left no dirt on him. Elaine was also apparently not very mature - she easily agrees to marriage proposals.It just seems obvious this movie was made in a different era. Doing basically the same things, the woman is the villain, the man the hero. He gets the girl, she the blame.So is this one of the best films ever? Unless you're one of those Christian Coalition people, I'd say no.",7,2,6,24 December 2002
