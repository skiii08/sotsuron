The Blair Witch Project," Fear by fear itself!!!
","I couldn't wait, I saw this movie on its first day and got shocked for days and days. This is probably one of the most scary movies ever made, I love it. The actors (specially Heather) are great, and could become big time stars. Most people around me didn't like it, because they were expecting a straight horror film. I predict that the scene when Heather tapes her eyes (one of the last ones) it's just a jewel... two thumbs up!, and I predict it'll become a classic movie flick.",10,1,2,27 November 1999
The Lives of Others," The ghost of authoritarian regimes
","I've been taking German lessons for about 2 months now, and since movies were great in helping me learn English language I'm always looking for German films to watch (as well as German music to listen to) in order to educate my ears.Anyway, I went to this place where I get all sort of rare movies and this one caught my attention... and I had no idea it got the Oscar for foreign language film this year! So I watched it without prejudice and... what did I find? A MASTERPIECE! This is the kind of movie that gets your attention from the first moment, and makes you interested in understanding the characters' psyche, which is very varied: you have the idealistic good guys, the idealistic bad guys, the people that broad their minds understanding that no political dogma is better than individual freedom, etc. And even though the movie has very tough moments it is all so well done and presented with such a good taste that in the end you feel some sort of relieved.In this present day, when the ghost of authoritarian regimes still fly over our heads (in my country we're getting closer and closer to that reality), this movie will make you think about how important love, life and freedom are.A must see!",10,138,155,11 March 2007
Amélie," Wonderful!
","I've been recommended to see this movie for quite long and finally I had the PLEASURE. I expected it to be good, but it was a lot more, it's been a wonderful experience, 'cause it's amazing how a movie can get you inside of it in such a way you LIVE the characters and the situations. It's a movie for the heart and the spirit, very uplifting, not in the dramatic way but with a fun twist. It's impossible not to display a wide smile while seeing it.To me there was a deep personal meaning by the time I saw it, 'cause there's a girl I know (and had a crush on back then) who reminded me of the Amélie character (only less pretty) but a very dreamful young lady who lost her mother at an early age.I won't say anything else but recommend it 100%.",10,0,1,4 January 2004
