The Blair Witch Project," THE BEST HORROR MOVIE IN A LONG LONG TIME!!
","*Sorry for spelling misstakes* Wow when i first saw this movie i was about to pee in my pants, i was so scared.I mean after one hour i was so scared so i couldn't close my eyes. Everyone who dislikes this movie i have only one thing to sa to you : Why this is the best horror movie in a long time.I think that everyone who hates this movie wasn't scared because they saw it early on the day.I saw this movie very very late about 00:00 , and i was scared as hell. I have heard some roomers that i will come a Blair witch project 2 and 3, if they are coming i really look forward to them.This movie is new kind of horror movie, and i would like if they were more people like Eduardo Sanches and Daniel Myrick,who could do more movies like this one.The plot and the script are great in this movie i love them. Everyone who complain on that the camera is to shaky,try to run in the wood's scared as hell then try to hold the camera still. Almost everyone who i know thinks that this movie is the worst movie they ever seen. They say that,ohh it is so bad because they dont see the witchand what we cant see can't hurt us.But what you can't see can really hurt you. BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think that this movie is so scary because it is so realistic. I give this movie 8Â½ out of 10.",Null,0,1,26 February 2000

American Beauty," Sam mendes is a genius!!!!!!!
","This movie is hilarious it has it all good actors,the best script i ever heard in a movie,you can't explain it in words. I personally think that american beauty should have won 6 oscars,but it won only 5,because matrix did won the oscar for best editing but i think that american beauty should won that oscar too. Sam Mendes has done an excellent job directing this movie,and Kevin Spacey,Annette Bening and Mena Suvari and all the other actors and actress have also done a very very good job too. I think that Alan Ball has done a VERY VERY good job with the script,and Thomas Newman has done the a great job with the movie.I say WOW what a break thru Sam Mendes got with this movie this is actually his first movie ever that has come out on video.I give this movie 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,14 August 2000
