Marie Antoinette," An insight - a window into - but not a film for MA uneducated
","The film is an insight to the world of Marie Antoinette, a window into her world. If you do not know the story of Marie Antoinette, you will not learn anything here.MA is a visual feast, the outfits, the decor of the Palace of Versailles (the actual Palace was used!). Kirsten Dunst was OK here, Schwarz was... i can't pin a good negative word, Rose Byrne was annoying, Judy Davis was wooden here (as it looked the role required), but Steve Coogan & Marrinne Faithful were good. Danny Huston was great as Emperor Joseph, Anntoinettes brother.To see some things that are not shown in many of these 'genre' of films (royal biography films?) but in large Marie Antoinette is a Lost in Translations (her earlier and very popular film) version of Marie Antoinettes' life.As people with even a small knowledge of Marie Antoinette, know she loses her head... and it is not even seen here!! Why? Ripped off.. show the full story if you wish to show her life story...",4,1,2,22 January 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Two Cowboys Went up a Mountain...
","By now you likely know the basic premise or something of Brokeback Mountain, i.e. It's about two gay cowboys. Well sort of.Another story taken from E. Annie Proulx short tale is made into an epic film about Ennis Del Mar, played by Heath Ledger, and Jack Twist, by Jake Gyllenhaal, who are two cowboy guys. They meet while being employed by Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid). Their job is to herd sheep, well fatten them up on public land on the quiet 'up on Brokeback Mountain' ready for sale the next season.While on the job for so many months together alone the usually quiet Ennis opens up to the more talkative, sometimes rodeo rider, Jack Twist. The landscape is beautiful, from the opening shot though it's the everyday for them. After one particular conversation (Jack: thats the most you have talked in these months', Ennis: 'it's the most I've talked in years') and the ubiquitous rum, Jack is more amorous and a little forceful. One thing leads to another This tale meanders across 20-30 years. After this encounter, the two fall into a lifelong addiction for each other, both afflicted in different ways. Both marry but Ennis still secretly pines for Jack & Jack pines back. But if Jack cant have Ennis then what else is there? Their infrequent encounters become less infrequent until Brokeback Mountain is held in high esteem by many and seen as not so good by many. It was a little of both for me. It's a long tale that took its sweet time looking at the great scenery as it goes, watching the life of Jack & Ennis take its ups & downs, and maybe it is a bit long for me. Check it out if you want an experience.Someone I know would tell you 'it got 8/10 on www.IMDb.com' but I will only give it 6.5/10",6,0,19,27 February 2006
No Country for Old Men," The Coens are back - 'No Country...' - A mini masterpiece!
","The long awaited new Coen brothers movie 'No Country For Old Men' is a mini masterpiece! Josh Brolin (Planet Terror, American Gangster, In The Valley of Elah, The Dead Girl) is Llewelyn Moss, an everyday guy who while out hunting stumbles across a scene that has gone horribly wrong. He discovers a case of money which he takes and proceeds to become the films kinetic energy, pushing it onward. Javier Bardem (The Sea Inside, Collateral, Before Night Falls) as the mysterious Prince Valiant coiffured villain Anton Chigurh (pronounced Sugerr) feverishly seeking its return, flipping coins along the way, is brilliantly menacing. Tommy Lee Jones (In the Valley of Elah, The Three Burials of ..., Double Jeopardy) is the soulful, philosophical Sheriff Ed Tom Bell carrying the morals of the movie while Woody Harelson (Cheers, Natural Born Killers) plays a bounty hunter, Carson Wells, who joins the hunt to catch the relentless Anton.'No Country...' is very noir'ish in its aura, It is put together in a most interesting way in what feels like a compilation of short stories. This opus is very scenic in that when there is a vista or some kind of landscape to capture, you feel its vastness, and when it is a confined space you are made to feel the claustrophobia. In 'No Country' you feel the heat of Texas, feel the tension when it is closing in, and you certainly feel the pain when it hits... But it also contains a sprinkling of the Coens trademark dry humour in well chosen places throughout. Well worth a look.This notch in the Coen Bros' belt is easily better than Intolerable Cruelty, & Lady Killers - but they are a 'different kettle of fish' really. 'Old Country...' is the type of film that the Coen Bros are more known for and maybe 'expected' of them. It is 'Blood Simple' mixed with 'Fargo' and perhaps a tiny pinch of 'Big Lebowski' thrown in.Don't ask me what I mean by a 'mini' masterpiece. Maybe I don't feel confident enough to say Masterpiece. Or maybe in my 'heart of hearts' I do not think it is totally deserving of this title, time will tell (some are stamping it a classic even now). But I can say it is a great yarn, some great action is install for you, terrific tension, acting (Brolin, Bardem, & Jones, Brolins wife, and mother-in-law), and overall... its certainly well worth a look!! 'No Country For Old Men' is an A+ cinematic experience.",9,2,6,14 February 2008
