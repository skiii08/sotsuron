Ford v Ferrari," Pure Adrenaline Rush From Start to Finish
","Ford V Ferrari is a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish. It's an absolutely thrilling film that fires on all cylinders.Ferrari dominates the annual 24-hour race at Le Mans for much of the 1960s. Ford decides to throw their hat in the ring, in hopes that a victory at Le Mans will raise their struggling sales. The former racer turned car designer Carrol Shelby (Matt Damon) and his difficult, but passionate racer pal Ken Miles (Christian Bale) are both brought on to help Ford craft a car to get to the finish line.Beneath the technical polish and gloss of Ford V Ferrari, the friendship between Shelby and Miles is the heart of the film. Christian Bale and Matt Damon are a large part of what makes this film work so well. This is their first movie together and yet, they interact with the ease of old friends. Their performances complement each other. You get really invested in this on-screen duo with an absurd amount of charm exuding from the screen.We all love a good underdog and this film is a classic underdog story. Ford V Ferrari isn't just about the race at Le Mans, but more about the human struggles encountered to get there. Pride and jealousy constrict Miles and Shelby at times, but the rigid corporate system of Ford Motor Company poses a greater challenge. Ford V Ferrari is an expansive, mesmerizing real-life story that feels perfect for the cinematic medium.Ford V Ferrari puts you in the driver's seat with the racers, but not in the way I was expecting. The stellar sound design and mixing are some of the best and extremely transportive. They give the racing sequences not just an immersive quality, but a transcendent one. James Mangold's direction is excellent. He gives you sequences that put you on the edge of your seat and capture your gaze. More so, Mangold has a strong grasp on pacing. The film knows when to slow down and emphasize character and emotion and when to boost its engine and hightail it to the next scene. In a film this long, it's remarkable that it feels as breezy as it does. Even if you know this story start to finish, the skill, technically and narrative in which it's told make this ride one easily worth taking.I recommend Ford V Ferrari for ages 7 to 14 for language. Even if you're not a race car fanatic, there's a good chance you'll love this film. I happily give it 5 out of 5 stars. This is easily one of my favorites of the year.",10,2,5,16 November 2019
Despicable Me 2," The Minions Are Back - Ever So Moreso
","I think this film is a very cute sequel to 'Despicable Me' and good news, the minions are in it even more. The 3D animation is wonderful in this movie and the designs and colors are very fun visually. I can tell the creators of this film paid attention to what audiences enjoyed most out of the first movie and that is what influenced a lot of 'Despicable Me 2.' I think all of the voice actors suited their characters perfectly. This film brings back the familiar voices of Miranda Cosgrove, Steve Carell and Russell Brand, while also adding in newer characters such as Lucy voiced by Kristen Wiig, Antonio voiced by Moises Arias and many others. My favorite character is actually all of the minions. I loved them all so much in the first 'Despicable Me' and I think it was a great decision to include them for in the sequel. Their banter is so funny, even though I can't understand their gibberish, their motions tell the story of what they're trying to communicate. I think the way they work together and fight is very comical and all of their interactions are very funny. The minions really are the perfect side kicks to Gru since he is so wacky. My favorite scene would probably be when Gru finds out that Margo is on a date. He freaks out so much and goes running around the mall trying to stop the two of them from being alone. It's really funny and although it is a bit over exaggerated, it still shows what all fathers go through when their daughters start showing an interest in dating. I also think it's funny how Margo's sisters react to her new romantic interests. Edith, being a total tomboy, thinks that it is disgusting for her sister to go on a date with a boy. Agnes on the other hand thinks it's the cutest thing and immediately starts saying that they are in love, which only worries Gru even more. The entire scene is filled with very funny, memorable dialog and interactions between the main characters and is definitely a scene that stands out for me.I recommend this film for ages 6+ and anyone who enjoyed 'Despicable Me' will absolutely love 'Despicable Me 2.' I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. It has the perfect mix of humor for children and adults so it makes for an enjoyable experience for all.Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Raven D.

Insidious: Chapter 2," Definitely gave me the creeps and I admit it did make me jump several times, but it isn't overly scary.
","I really enjoy this film. It fits in so well with 'Insidious' and I love how they tie in scenes from the first film. The plot in this movie is great because it makes things interesting and twisted while still keeping you in the loop of what's going on. The first film in the 'Insidious' series makes so much more sense now because 'Insidious Chapter 2' explains so much. I think the soundtrack for this film is awesome. All of the special effects noises are instrumentals are really loud, intense and gritty. They give this film a unique feel and it captures the horror in the movie perfectly. I think the cinematography and visuals in this movie are very powerful. The color choices are spot on. When in the spirit world, everything is given a subtle bluish-green hue and there is lots of fog, I think this is super cool because it shows the separation from reality in a way that is obvious, but not overdone. And since everything is a very similar color in the spirit realm scenes, the accents of bold colors stand out even more and create a dramatic effect. My favorite character is Josh Lambert played by Patrick Wilson. At first I didn't honestly like this character because I thought the acting was not very genuine which was odd because Patrick Wilson does an amazing job in the first movie, but soon I realized that this was on purpose. There's something new about this character, something a little off and it makes the film amazing. I think Patrick does an amazing job portraying these subtle changes in personality. I can't say much more about this though because I don't want to spoil the plot.Anyone who knows me knows I am a huge fan of the horror/thriller genre, and a sucker for supernatural films. Insidious Chapter 2 definitely gave me the creeps and I admit it did make me jump several times, but it wasn't overly scary. I give Insidious Chapter 2 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13+ because it's an intense film. So be sure to check it out in a theater near you!Reviewed by Raven D, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Moneyball," A Hit, Even With Non Sports Fans
","Daniel Menegaz, our 13-year-old film critic loved Moneyball, even though he admits, he's not a big sports fan. Here are his comments: Moneyball is the invigorating true story about the rise of the Oakland A's â€”a baseball team with a tiny budget. Starring Brad Pitt as Billy Beane and Jonah Hill as Peter Brand, the duo try to re-invent the game of baseball by using a new way of recruiting players. The movie was serious at times, but the comic relief is very funny. I thought it was really clever when they used real footage of baseball games in the film, as well as recreating games. The acting was also spot on. Considering I'm not the biggest baseball fan, this movie was actually really good. It is rated PG- 13 for some profanity but, aside from that, all of the subject matter is appropriate for kids as young as ten. Over all, I would give Moneyball 4 out of 5 stars.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21t_M9IVLYw",Null,0,1,6 October 2011
The Avengers," Action Packed, Comedy Filled, Great Storyline - Perfect for Kids
","As they say in comic books - 'Bam!' 'Ka-Pow?' While that's not really what the superheroes of The Avengers have to say (they are much more articulate), their actions are fairly true to their comic book roots. KIDS FIRST! youth film critics Julianna No one and Talia Rashba each give the film a full 5 out of 5 stars, and are quite articulate on their reasons for the top rating.Talia Rashba http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S78fik503mgThis movie is absolutely fantastic! It is packed with a ton of action and humor and will transport you into an amazing supernatural world where it is all about the good guys fighting the bad. The story is about a group of famous superheroes that come together to defeat the evil Loki, who has stolen a powerful energy cube that he intends to use to take over the world. The superheroes include Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye. Each with a unique and special supernatural power. At first, the superheroes fight about being a team, but, eventually, they work together.The Avengers could have ended up being a typical superhero movie, but it isn't. Because there are so many heroes, it is much more creative and entertaining. The Avengers is packed with fabulous actors. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man. Just like he was in the Iron Man movie, he thinks he is better than everyone else, but luckily, he is really quite funny so you end up liking him a lot. Captain America (Chris Evans) is strong and serious, and he is always ready to get the job done. Actor Mark Ruffalo plays the ferocious green form known as the Incredible Hulk. He really stands out and takes over the scenes he is in. Superhero Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has some of the most incredible battle scenes. And Black Widow, portrayed by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson, is the one who convinces the others to put aside their differences and work with each other. An interesting fact is that actor Lou Ferrigno, who has played The Hulk in almost every film since 1978, is actually the Hulk's voice in the movie. The Avengers is written and directed by Joss Whedon, who does an amazing job. He makes sure that there is a lot of humor in the movie and that the action scenes really grab your attention. The special effects were incredible. The superheroes change from their everyday selves into their supernatural selves in an interesting and fun way. The fight scenes and explosions are unbelievable. Also, there is a really neat headquarters for the agency that you just have to see for yourself! Even though it is rated PG-13, I think kids ages 11, as well as all adults, will love this movie, especially if action is their thing. I am giving this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommending that you see it right away! Julianna No one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeT6pETKFaQLooking for a hero? Well, look no further, because The Avengers is in theaters everywhere! This action-packed and comedy-filled film is a movie that appeals to comic book fans and all movie-goers with its great storyline and a strong cast/ The basis of this movie is the world is under threat from another world, Chitauri, and there is a need for more than just all the world's defenses to save it. The world needs the 'Avenger Initiative', which is a plan put together by S.H.I.E.L.D., an international peace-keeping agency, which calls for S.H.I.E.L.D. to bring together some of the world's greatest heroes: Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner. Nick Fury, played by the always intense Samuel L. Jackson, leads the S.H.I.E.L.D. agency. I have watched all of the individual movie releases of the Hulk, Thor, Captain America and both Iron Man movies and loved them all, but, as most, was concerned whether they would work together to create a great movie. Well, they have done that and more, with a storyline that allows the main characters to, at times, shine on their own but at other times pairs them up perfectly to bring great balance to the story. Josh Whedon, director and co-writer, and Zach Penn, co-writer, blend the action sequences in with very well-timed comedic moments. I love how they bring so many different levels of conflict into the movie. There is brother vs. brother, between Thor and his evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the film's antagonist. There is internal conflict each of the main characters has with themselves, as we watch Dr. Banner trying to control his inner demons. And there is the overall conflict of our world vs. the other world, called Chitauri. There is also the conflict between the heroes themselves, which leads to many of the funniest parts of the film. My favorite scene is when the heroes first come together on the S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft and are discussing the devastation that Loki has brought to Earth. Thor jumps to Loki's defense and states, 'He's my brother,' to which the Black Widow responds, 'He has killed 80 people in two days.' Thor responds, 'He's adopted!' It's one of the many laugh-out-loud moments. My favorite character(s) would be the Avengers as a whole, as they each have their own unique and likable traits. I love the special effects, particularly the touch screen computers that float in the air, and the use of CGI in this film as it was worked into the live-action sequences. The CGI Hulk was especially well done and was much more human-like in this film and funny as well. This movie is great for all ages and I rate it 5 out of 5 stars. It's a must-see movie for comic book and non-comic book fans.",9,3,8,8 May 2012
First Man," The Man Behind One Of The Most Famous Events In Human History
","Easily one of the most famous events in human history is centered around a singular man, Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling). Behind the Apollo Mission that landed the first human on the moon, Neil is a man with conflicts, a man with a history and a man with a mission.Despite being mainly focused on an intense-action packed mission, First Man explores many avenues that include dramatic and intense moments which spawn from the heart-wrenching grief of losing a child to the intricate and beautiful romance with his wife, Janet (Claire Foy). Much of the movie has emotions that are quite far from being out of this world, specifically in its massive focus on the family.The film begins up close and personal seeing Armstrong in his daring mission on the rocket-propelled plane, the X-15. Immediately, the story shows just how dangerous space exploration can be and how close those who brave exploring the final frontier get to never returning home. It follows Neil and his story intimately from the X-15 mission to the loss of three astronauts (close friends of Neil's) in Apollo 1, the near-lethal mission of Gemini 8 and, of course, the incredibly daring mission of Apollo 11, that landed the first people on the Moon. Throughout these milestones in space exploration, the story pauses to look at the relations and life of Neil, truly unveiling the blueprints showing who he was as a man.While incredible in revealing a massive side of this well-known historical event, the film attempts to focus so much on a story that has little to tell. The length clocks in at just under two and a half hours, which feels very stretched after the adrenaline of the exciting opening scene wears off. Neil Armstrong is portrayed as a deep man with little visual emotions mixed with dramatic internal conflicts. While this decision allows for excellent character design, it makes him rather boring at times. It seems the writers wished to divide First Man into three stories - one, the story of Neil as a man; two, the story of Neil as a father and three, the story of Neil as an astronaut. All three have their pros and their cons, but mixed together, the film becomes daunting and stretched.The cinematography sadly could have been better. Only a handful of camera shots do not shake. In most shots, the camera moves constantly or jitters. In the beginning, with the X-15 mission, this effect adds to the entertainment of the film. The audience quickly becomes sucked into the important and lethal mission with dangers at every corner. After two hours of shaky camera shots, that excitement changes to annoyance. While a mix would be ideal, and in more intensive scenes a camera shake would be appropriate, having the entire runtime featuring shakiness as well as many blurry shots, looks amateur and comes off as poor execution of what should be an interesting and captivating story.However, the film does go beyond the moon in many ways - predominantly, in the acting. Neil Armstrong has deep faults and that stands as a challenge to any actor. Ryan Gosling nails the role in what turns out as an OscarÃ‚Â©-worthy performance of the famous astronaut. Others, including Claire Foy, also deliver extraordinary performances bringing each character to life. Despite the fact that no one can hear you scream in space, the sound design really belongs out of the world due to the quality and complexity of the sound effects. Much of First Man contains loud, intricate sound effects that vary and cover a massive spectrum. Perhaps more powerful would have been the use of silence in the most dramatic moments, sending chills to the entire audience.My favorite scene is one of these moments of eerie silence. In this scene, three members of the Apollo 1 mission do a test in the Apollo capsule. It goes horribly wrong and the interior of the capsule catches on fire, sadly, resulting in losing the lives of all three. Yet, the film takes this a step further, as the three fallen heroes are not new in this scene. The viewer gets time to like them, understand them and befriend them - just as Neil did in real life. This makes their sudden and dramatic loss nothing short of shocking and cold, replicating the real-life impact it had on Armstrong.Although, First Man has a strong beginning, a strong ending and many high points throughout, it also has many mistakes and things that could be improved that simply negate the extraordinary story of this story. For that reason, I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars. The story is quite intensive and is best suited for older audiences that will understand the impact of the events so I recommend it for ages 12 to 18. This film opens nationwide in theaters on October 12, 2018 so, look for it. If you are a fan of space exploration, it is sure to make an impact, but even if you aren't you will learn something new.Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Simply Fantastic! Everything I Wanted!!
","This much anticipated film is absolutely fantastic with some action and a stellar cast that will blow your mind! This epic story continues with Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peetar Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) who both play a big part in the lives of District 13'ers, each in their own way. They want to unite and save an entire nation. In order to do this, they need the help of their friends and new alliances. I completely love this film and the overall production. It's intense and has such a grand feel to it. With scene after scene, it gets bigger and bigger and you see just how powerful one voice can be. The aerial shots, emotions, excitement and the anticipation of what's happening next basically keeps your eyes glued to the screen. I've read all the books and this adaption is very true to the original stories. Jennifer Lawrence's performance is incredible. She becomes her character completely with a range of emotions - anger, doubt, disbelief and feeling sorry. She is so convincing. My favorite character is Peetar. Although he is not on-screen time as much as the other characters, he plays a big part in the film. Peeta is what drives Katniss throughout the film as she struggles to get to him. Almost everything she does is a result of her wanting to save Peeta. I also like Peeta because, every time he is on screen, he seems to change and intensify the situation. My favorite scene is when Katniss sees Peeta for the very first time. She is shocked and, at the same time, grateful that he is alive. It is nice to see all of the questions that go though her mind through her own eyes. Katniss' eyes reveal how she feels about Peeta. I recommend this film for ages 13 to 18 and I give it 4 out of 5 stars. It is a little slow in the beginning, but I understand why. They have to bring you up to speed with what happened in the previous film. I cannot wait to see Part 2!Satisfy your excitement and see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay â€“ Part 1. It is playing in theaters now, so please check it out.Reviewed by Brianna B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10,26,67,24 November 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," More Fun Than an Ocean Full of CGI Mermaids
","KIDS FIRST! youth film critic, Daniel Menegaz reviewed Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides for us. You can see his videotaped review, together with his twin brother Jonah, here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMBP6w8qFBkOr read his written review below: Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, is a continuation of the adventures of Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), this time in a race to the Fountain of Youth along with femme fatale Angelica (Penelope Cruz), the infamous pirate Black Beard (Ian McShane) and crusty Barbossa (Geoffery Rush). The movie is very exciting, with a lot of action and a healthy dose of well placed humor. Not only is the acting good, but the action choreography is amazing as well. The roles of the characters are perfectly portrayed by the actors playing them. The CGI is so real, (especially of the mermaids) you are sure to be on the edge of you seat, almost in the movie. But if you want to feel like you're really a part of all the action, see it in Imax or 3DÂ… or both. The picture in Imax 3D is astonishing and helped make the movie all it could be. The soundtrack is also very well played, setting the tone of each scene nicely. If you're looking for a good movie, go see Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. You're guaranteed to have a great time!Reviewed by Daniel Menegaz age 13, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic",Null,1,2,3 June 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Great Action Film - Particularly for Holmes' Fans
","If you are into action films, you will love the latest film about our favorite detective. Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick Dr. Watson try to kill their foe, Professor Moriarty because Holmes believes he is linked to a number of recent crimes. They discover that Moriarty invests in companies in England owning cotton and other goods. He plans to start a war so that there will be a high demand for the goods, so he can make a fortune. Will Holmes succeed in preventing this war?The cinematography of the movie is impressive. Several action scenes are filmed in slow motion, making it more thrilling. However, the lighting of the movie is gloomy and, for me doesn't really match the tone of the movie since it is a combination of action and adventure with a dash of comedy. The storyline of the movie doesn't quite work for me either. Although the film is like 'Mission Impossible' in the 19th century, it's a bit difficult to hear what the characters are saying since they have a British accent, and the plot gets confusing at times. I did enjoy the ending though. It is interesting watching the director's comparison of the face-off between Holmes and Professor Moriarty to a chess game.I recommend this film to teens 13 and up, especially to fans of Sherlock Holmes. If you have a sharp eye and keen hearing, then you might find Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows intriguing.Reviewed by Gabriella Chu, age 15, KIDS FIRST!

The Monuments Men," Sometimes Our Achievements Are Worth Dying For
","This is a dramatic film, with some humorous moments, that shows the importance of human achievement and I loved every minute of it. The story is based on true events that center on the ending of World War II, when Nazi troops hid artwork from around Europe for Chancellor Hitler. President Roosevelt lets Lt. Frank Stokes (George Clooney) gather an unlikely squad of museum directors, curators and art historians to enter Europe and save, not only art, but people's history.What makes this film strong is its story and how it shows the characters' passion for their goal. I'm not an art critic, but I recognized some of the artists and their work. But I'm not into art like these people were. However, when you see the soldiers torching the art, my heart broke and my stomach tied in knots. Watching this film reminds me that art isn't just paintings or sculptures, it's about people's accomplishments and, if that's gone, what do we have?The screenplay is beautifully written by Grant Heslov and George Clooney, who also directs this movie. This film can be humorous, but it also shows the reality of war. For example, they talk about concentration camps and that's a risky move. It refers to the inhumanity that happened, but they balance well so it's not 'Shindlers List.' This dream cast includes Bill Murray (Sgt. Richard Campbell), John Goodman (Sgt. Walter Garfield), and more memorable actors that play fantastic people. Just watching them interact is entertaining enough.My favorite character is Pvt. Preston Salvitz (Bob Balaban). I pick this character because when I see Bob play Preston he becomes a little ball of fire and I love this person's passion for art.My favorite scene involves Sgt. Campbell (Murray) receiving a recording from his daughter while he's fighting in the war. Preston plays the recording on the announcement intercom and your heart turns to mush as Bill sits by himself smiling with tears in his eyes while listening to his daughter's voice.The moral of the story is, 'Sometimes our achievements are worth dying for.' 'The Monuments Men' love art and that's why they are picked for this team. They are willing to die to protect it. I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for 12 to 18-year-olds. There's some action, blood and language that younger kids shouldn't experience, however the film shows our human side and how we live to create achievements. Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST!

Captain Phillips," What a Story! It Draws You in From the Get Go and Never Lets Go!
","This movie is amazing! It is really cool and has a ton of action and is based on a true story. I wish I had this movie so I could watch it again!This movie is based on the true story about a guy named Richard Phillips who is a captain of a ship. Pirates come and take the captain as hostage. Eventually he is stuck on a life boat with the pirates and the captain just wants to see his family again. Luckily the navy comes but they don't want to hurt Captain Phillips so they try to trick the pirates. The movie is very intense and I was on edge the whole time. The main characters in the movie are Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks), Muse (Barkhad Abdi), Bilal (BArkhad Abdirahman), Najee (Faysal Ahmen), and Elmi Mahat M. Ali). My favorite character in this movie is Captain Phillips because he is really nice and he would rather sacrifice his own life for his crew. That shows how much he cares about other people. It really made me think about what I would do in this type of situation.My favorite part in the movie is when they capture the captain because that's when the action really starts. It's not good that he gets captured but you see a lot of action after that. You see the navy show up, you hear threats from the pirates, you see helicopters in the air. Everything goes crazy! But that's what I love about these kinds of movies.I recommend this movie for ages 12 and up because this movie is really scary and has a lot of violence and parts that are bloody. It is rated pg-13 so I wouldn't recommend it for younger kids.Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Anthony A. For more youth reviews, go to kidsfirst dot org",8,1,3,18 November 2013
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Twilight: Breaking Dawn part 1 - Should Your Teen See It?
","The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1, reviewed by our 13-year-old critic, Daniel Menegaz is the first half of the final installment of the Twilight saga movies based on the novel by Stephanie Meyer that has gripped the nation since Twilight first came out on print. Here are Daniel's comments: It is about the tortured love story between Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) the vampire. In this first part, Bella gets married, and then gets pregnant on her honeymoon. Having read Breaking Dawn, I thought it was fairly accurate to the story. Although, the book doesn't have quite enough information to stretch into two movies, I found the movie a little boring. The movie has some heavy drama; in fact, that is something I didn't like. All the characters seemed to be depressed at what should have been a happy moment. Other than that, the movie was fairly good. I really enjoyed the soundtrack and particularly the scenes. The movie has some very stunning nature shots. I think this movie is for ages 13 and up because of very inappropriate subject matter regarding the sex and Bella's pregnancy. Overall, I would give this movie 3.5 out of 5 stars. If you are looking for a movie filled with drama, vampires, and werewolves, this is your movie.

The Perks of Being a Wallflower," One of, if not the best movie I have ever seen
","Our 14-year-old KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Victoria Burns, found this film to be the 'best she has ever seen' and noted that 'this movie can prepare teens to not keep emotions and experiences bottled up because school can be painful and stressful.' Below is her review.I can honestly say that it was one of, if not the best movie that I have ever seen. It was so pivotal that it almost made me cry, and that says a lot because I almost never cry. It was great to see a movie that beautifully showed some of the struggles that real teenagers go through and not sugar coated. This movie is very emotional and has great acting. I like the way the flashback scenes are shown, by alternating from the present to the past, then showing the aftermath after the flashbacks. I had never seen Emma Watson in anything but the Harry Potter series, and she is amazing playing Sam, I have never seen her play a character like this. The movie is so good that no words can explain. I bought the book directly after I watched the movie. I also love how throughout the whole movie most of the story is told by Charlie (Logan Lerman) who writes letters anonymously to 'A Friend' who doesn't exist. This movie is about a severely depressed and lonely boy, Charlie, whose best friend killed himself before the school year starts. So now, Charlie has no friends and people think he is weird because he holds in and takes the pain of himself and all of the people he loves, sometimes it all wells up and he has anxiety attacks. This year he is determined to make friends and he meets the flamboyant Patrick (Ezra Miller), and his stepsister Sam (Emma Watson). They let him in and introduce him to a whole new world filled with fun, sadness, and just plain life. Plus, he falls in love with Sam along the way. All of Charlie's friends are seniors, and he makes a mistake that makes them go away for a while. But then he does something to make them love him even more than before. I think that everyone should watch this movie. I like how, whenever something bad or slightly inappropriate happens in the flashbacks, the scene hints at what was happening without blatantly showing what happened. My favorite quote from the movie is when Charlie's English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) tells him that, 'We accept the love we think we deserve.' I think it is so profound and absolutely true. I recommend this movie for eighth graders going into high school up to any adult. This movie can prepare teens to not keep emotions and experiences bottled up because school can be painful and stressful. I give it five out of five stars because this movie is amazing and will someday be a classic.",10,7,14,21 September 2012
The Finest Hours," Based on a true story in all its terrifying detail
","The Finest Hours is a Walt Disney film that is filled with much determination that captivates your mind on a realistic approach of being in the ocean on a boat wondering if you will survive. This moved me because you have to be a thinker, organizer and strategist in order to achieve the obstacles that you will be encountering. I really loved this movie because it is in 3D which makes everything appear to be coming right at you and you feel like you are a part of the film, especially during the ocean scenes. This film is based on a true story and it is filled with action, drama and history. The director, Craig Gillespie draws you into this film by his realistic portrayal of events. One of the worst storms to ever hit the East Coast struck New England in February 1952. It damaged an oil tanker off the coast of Cape Cod and literally ripped it in half. On a small lifeboat faced with frigid temperatures and 70-foot high waves, four members, Bernie Weber (Chris Pine), Ben Foster (Richard Livesey), Andy Fitzgerald (Kyle Gallner) and Ervin Maske (John Magaro) of the Coast Guard set out to rescue the more than 30 stranded sailors trapped aboard the rapidly-sinking vessel. The captain gives the orders and sends them out to accomplish the goal.My favorite part of this movie is when Bernie Weber and his fellow crew members set out to find the people on the sinking ship. They lose connection with the captain and also lose their compass. The crew members want Bernie to turn back around, but he says, 'no point'. Bernie just keeps on going to see if he can find any type of vessel. He becomes obstinate and passionate about his Coast Guard duty.The setting is a 1950s snowy and cold day with distinguished vintage cars the town people drive. The women's dress is classy and stylish and they definitely make a statement upon arrival to any event. I recommend this film for ages 12 to 18 and I give it 5 out of 5 Stars because it is action-packed with some romance and tense moments. Younger audiences may not understand and might be scared.

The Sound of Music," The Most Beloved Family Film of All Time Turns 50!
","The 50th Anniversary Edition of Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music is a must-have for every family. This 5-disc DVD set includes the movie in HD and standard definition, a new 60 minute documentary called The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg and lots of other special features. The Sound of Music is the best family film of all time because it brings everyone together with its great, true-life story of the Von Trapp family. The songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein are all wonderful and unforgettable. Each song is a masterpiece. Some might think Frozen is an amazing movie musical, but Rodger and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music is a million times better! The quality of the song writing just cannot be compared with anything else. The Sound of Music stars Julie Andrews as Maria, a young Austrian woman who is training to be a nun at a monastery. Christopher Plummer stars as Captain Von Trapp, a wealthy Austrian naval captain who hires Maria as governess to his seven children. It was directed by Robert Wise. It won five Academy Awards including Best Picture.The documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg, which is included in this 50th anniversary DVD edition, is informative and revealing. We go behind-the-scenes to visit the original locations in the film: the monastery, the Cathedral, the Von Trapp estate (which is really a classical music school) and a 100-year-old marionette theater which was the inspiration for the puppet scene in the film. It is wonderful to see Julie Andrews so excited about coming back and visiting the film's locations after 50 years. For those who love the songs, the 50th Anniversary DVD Edition also includes the original soundtrack from the film. And there are lots of other bonus material, such as Music Machine Sing-Along; Audio Commentaries with Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, and Director Robert Wise; A City of Songâ€”Virtual Map of Filming Locations in Salzburg, Austria; Vintage Rodgers and Hammerstein and The Sound of Music programs; and more. The Sound of Music is appropriate for all ages. The documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg is appropriate for those ages 10 to 18. I rate this new DVD set 5 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by Clayron P, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, go to kidsfirst dot org.",Null,1,7,16 March 2015
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' Comes Home
","Many people who attended the 1982 Cannes Film Festival remember E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial as an overwhelming force that so captured everyone's heart and interest that 'phone home' was the catch-phrase along the Croisette. The darling of that prestigious film fest that year, E.T. (one of the titles for the KIDS FIRST! Film Critics Search, now out on DVD and Blu-ray) has stood the test of time and equally delights a new generation, as our KIDS FIRST! youth film critics' reviews attest: 'This quirky family classic is a favorite of mine,' says Blake Hawes, age 15. Julianne No one, age 12, rates it 'six out of five stars because it's absolutely amazing, entertaining and enjoyable.' 'This is the best sci- fi film,' says Cheyenne Nguyen, age 8. 'Steven Spielberg, even in the 1980s, went above and beyond to create something new,' says Victoria Burns, age 14, comparing the film's special effects favorably to what has evolved now, 30 years later. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Reviewed by Blake Hawes See his full review on video at http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=LPbXG6v5_Xo E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is an instant classic. It is one of Steven Spielberg's best movies: an adventure about a young boy named Elliott and his new alien friend E.T. trying to get E.T. back to his planet. It is a heartwarming journey full of memorable scenes and incredible lighting and photography. This quirky family classic is a favorite of mine and is a part of my childhood. E.T. has some of the most amazing music I have ever heard in film. 'Turn on Your Heartlight' by Neil Diamond is the main theme of this movie, and a good one at that. The storyline and character development are extremely well done. By the end of the film, you have an emotional attachment to the majority of the characters. The scene where Elliott and E.T. are riding bikes and then suddenly start to float into the air over a silhouette of the moon is fantastic photography at its finest. Overall, I give the movie five out of five stars. I find this movie suitable for all ages. Check this flick out on HDNet Movies later this month. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Reviewed by Julianna No one See her full review on video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A- sVmVEN9_A If you love films about aliens, then this classic film is for you. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film is as good today as it was when it was released 30 years ago. Also, this film has a star-studded cast, including Dee Wallace as Mary, Peter Coyote as Keys, and an adorable Drew Barrymore as Gertie. Follow along as Elliott, played by Henry Thomas, finds a lost alien that he names E.T. Can Elliott help E.T. find his way home? You'll just have to watch to find out. My favorite character is E.T. because E.T. is just the most adorable thing ever. He's just so cute and so funny. Also, my favorite scene is when Elliott. realizes that his plant is coming back to life and he's, like, 'Oh, my gosh, E.T. could be alive again.' And so he goes over to the coffin, opens it, and he's, like, 'Oh, E.T.' and E.T. goes, 'Home phone, phone home' and he just starts yelling 'home' and 'phone.' It's absolutely hilarious. Elliott has to go running and get a blanket and wrap it around his head so no one will know E.T. is alive. He's so happy after that. So, I love that scene. The cinematography and special effects in this film are absolutely amazing. I am so impressed with how they made E.T. look so cute and so real. Also, the music adds such great effect to this movie. I think it is great; they did a great job. I think that this film is for people of all ages because it's such a great film and it's a classic. I think everyone is going to enjoy this. It's very entertaining. Also, I think that this film is rated six out of five stars because it's absolutely amazing, entertaining and enjoyable. I love it.

Elliott and Gertie have to go through a lot of twists and turns because they have to keep E.T. a secret. The best scene in this movie is when Elliott and E.T. are touching fingers. It's such a touching and magical moment. The message in this movie is Elliott and E.T. are so connected that they do not have any barriers. My favorite character in this movie is E.T. because he's so magical, loving and caring. I give this movie five out of five stars. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

If I Stay," A Moving Film That Makes Me Think About My Own Family and What's Important
","If I stay is a beautiful, moving film about a teenage girl and the life or death decision she must make. Mia is a teenage girl that has a wonderful, quirky family, a boyfriend who loves her to pieces, and a bright, ambitious future. But, all of that changes when she and her family are in a fatal car accident. While Mia's body is in a coma, her mind journeys back to all of her memories, triumphs, heart breaks and future. She has to make the decision on whether or not to fight and stay alive, or let go and leave this world. Will Mia stay? I love this movie. It made me laugh, cry and it helped me to see all of the good in my own life that I should cherish, because you never know when it could all change. The cinematography is beautiful. Most of the film is filled with memories that Mia has and the way they are portrayed is very neat. The music is also beautiful. Mia is a cellist and a lot of the film focuses on her dreams of becoming a successful musician, so the film is filled with beautiful classical music. My Favorite character is Mia played by Chloe Moretz. This film shows so many aspects of Mia's life, so it's easy to find something to relate to. She has a great passion for playing the cello and dedicates most of her life to it. She has difficulties relating to her parents and even her boyfriend since their musicals tastes are far more edgy than hers. She has to face her insane loss and she has to choose between many different things in life. There's something about her life that I think anyone can relate to, so she's a wonderful character. Chloe does a wonderful job portraying everything she's going through and she moved me to tears many times.This film makes me think about my own family and everything I would do for them. It makes me think of my life and all the joys and sorrows I've faced. There was not a dry eye in the audience because this film provokes unique memories for every individual. I felt especially connected to Mia's family because I too have a younger brother and am very close with my parents, so I was very touched by Mia's situation. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 because of the intense emotions and mature content.

Gravity," A Thrilling mix of 'Matrix' meets 'Inception'
","A movie with such a title that is about the scary and dark void called 'space,' you'd expect to be thrilling. Well, I have to tell you this movie is beyond thrilling. This film is a perfect combination of 'Matrix' and 'Inception' and will pump your adrenaline to a maximum level! 'Gravity' is a life time experience that everyone must see! If you add to the mix that Sandra Bullock and George Clooney star in it as main characters, it just doesn't get better than that!Since this movie has so many genres, it's hard to tell its main one. This movie has adventure, comedy, sorrow, suspense, thrilling scenes, intense scary scenes and so much more! The main one out of all these fantastic genres is definitely suspense. You walk in feeling bored and tired and you walk out feeling like Ryan Stone in the movie. (Sandra Bullock)The thrilling adventure begins when a young medical engineer named Ryan Stone goes up in space to help with installations for the Hubble Telescope. It seems like a casual spacewalk, but when she gets stranded away from her ship, 'Explorer,' she needs to get back to Earth by hitching a ride on a different station. If you want to find out how and if she and her co-worker, Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) make it back to Earth alive, you have to watch the film.The movie has so much adventure and so many impressive and clear graphics, it's hard not to like it! You feel like you are right there, experiencing whatever the main characters experience. The acting is amazing and there is deep meaning behind it - what would you do, if you were alone in the deepest and darkest part of this entire universe, with nobody but yourself? What would your thoughts be? Would you be able to remain hopeful or just give up and let Space take you? The camera work is the best I've ever seen. Alfonso CuarÃ³n, I give you standing ovation for directing this masterpiece. My favorite scene is when Ryan is stuck in a damaged escape pod with no fuel. She thinks she's stranded. Before she decides to give up and loose hope of returning to Earth, she starts to see Matt. Matt gets in when she does not have her helmet on and shows her that she can get back. As soon as his statement is over, he's gone. She hallucinated him but the plan worked! It's a very interesting and important scene in the movie and that's why I like it. The movie is rated PG-13 and I honestly think it is appropriate for age 12 to 18. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and it is showing in theaters everywhere right now. I may be wrong, but I predict Oscar nominations for the cast and director of 'Gravity.' Let's see what happens in 2014!Reviewed by Gerry O, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

The Maze Runner," An Action Packed, Visually Stunning Film That Will Keep You on the Edge of Your Seat Throughout
","The Maze Runner is an action packed, visually stunning new film that made hold my breath and kept me on the edge of my seat till the very end. The Maze Runner tells the story of Thomas, played by Dylan O'Brien, who wakes up in a giant crate with no memory of his passed. He is taken to 'The Glade,' a place full of boys who were taken and had their memories erased as well. Thomas soon learns that they are trapped in a giant maze, and once you're stuck inside, you never make it out alive. Everything begins to change when a girl is brought to the Glade and so Thomas decides it is time to face the maze and find the whole truth about the people who placed them there. But the truth they find might be even more horrible than the maze itself.I absolutely love this film. It is so intense and visually stunning. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made my heart race through the entire the film. Every time Thomas is inside the maze, I felt as if I was there with him, running for my life. But this isn't just an adrenaline packed adventure. The Maze Runner also moved me to tears and made me think about the way we can work together when we are truly faced with a challenge. The visuals are incredible as well. The maze is so complex and ever changing and it's so cool to be able to 'explore' it in a sense and see all of the detail put into the CGI. The entire cast is incredible. All the characters are so unique and have their own personality and quirks, but they work together in such a seamless way. My favorite character is Thomas played by Dylan O'Brien. He is the main character in this film and really makes the whole thing come to life. The boys that live in the Glade have been there for three years and, of course, they have tried to find a way out. But, most of them have essentially decided that they will live out the rest of their days there. When Thomas shows up, he tests the system and refuses to accept his fate of being stuck in the maze. I admire his character because he thinks outside of the box and finds his own way. He looks past his fear and is a strong leader despite the doubts people may have in him.It's been very interesting seeing the theme of films that have been coming out recently. Hunger Games, Divergent, Enders Game, The Giver and now The Maze Runner all have something in common. They tell the story of young adults, children really, who have to group together and take on some very serious situations, sometimes things even adults can't handle. It shows youth questioning authority, standing up for what's right and making their own way. These strong themes send out a message of empowerment to the youth of our generation, but this can also be a bit overwhelming. I know it's difficult watching adults fight for their lives, kill and be killed, and have their worlds torn apart. But it's even more shocking to see children go through these trials.Because of this, I recommend The Maze Runner for ages 13+ because of the intense situations and violence. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made me hold my breath during the intense situations, and I love when a film gets me so involved, but that may be too much for some to handle. I give The Maze Runner 5 out of 5 stars and can't wait to see it again. Catch it in theaters near you now!Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",9,1,3,22 September 2014
Captain Marvel," A Must-Watch for Any Superhero Fan!
","Captain Marvel is a solid, if slightly flawed entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A talented cast and savvy direction make for a crowd pleaser. Any superhero fan must watch this as the hype for Avengers: Endgame arises.The story follows Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) as she becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes. Set in the 90s, this adventure follows her struggle to regain her past as one mysterious incident created her powers. Amidst this, a galactic war arises between the Kree, her brethren, and the Skrulls, shapeshifting fugitives, as Carol remains the only one powerful enough to end the war. This war takes to Earth, with S.H.I.E.L.D. in its adolescence investigating. With this, Carol must team up with no other than a nascent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) as the two investigate all sides to this war.Brie Larson, as Carol Danvers, surprised me and is my favorite character as she is nothing like what the controversial trailers portrayed - hardened and emotionless. In fact, she is very sassy and witty, like Tony Stark, and even humanizes the character with her relatable struggles. Sure she is stoic and hardened to some extent, but she does everything she needs to, as audiences need to be sold of her importance in not just Avengers: Endgame, but the whole MCU, and that's exactly what we get. Samuel L. Jackson, as Nick Fury, is absolutely incredible, even if certain character decisions from a writing standpoint are very questionable, with one reveal just baffling. The dynamics between Danvers and Fury is one of the movie's best, with a buddy cop feel to it. It is investing to watch the younger, more inexperienced Fury, with certain nods to his future being a neat addition. The same goes to Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson. It is a welcome surprise to see the simpler days of these two. Ben Mendelsohn, as Talos, also gives his all with his Skrull leader a formidable foe and he is more charismatic for it. As twists and turns reveal, he and his race became a sympathetic asset, with their kind being one of the most intriguing amongst the MCU roster. Last but not least, Jude Law, as Yon-Rogg, is interesting in his mentorship of Carol, and the twists regarding his character add for an emotional edge.Anna Boden and Ryan Fledge aptly direct the film, with a stylish approach somewhat like Thor: Ragnarok. Every scene is well produced, but the style and vision are sometimes lost amongst the craft. The special effects are mostly on standard, but the de-aging effects for Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg rise far above the standard. They don't look fake, and all expressions are truly natural. We are truly in the future of seamless CGI. My favorite scene is when Danvers truly becomes Captain Marvel, unleashing her full power amongst an enemy crew.The message of this film is to never give up. Danvers takes several hits, to the point of giving up, but she always rises up to the challenge. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 due to some intense violence and language.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

The Hunger Games," A Must See!
","OMG, the Hunger Games is a MUST SEE! Julianna No one, reviews the film for KIDS FIRST! below: Video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHyKC-RSNnwAdapted from the first of 3 novels, written by Suzanne Collins and directed by Gary Ross, this film brought such an adrenaline rush of excitement that I couldn't sit still watching it. Set in a not too distant future, where North America has been replaced by Panem, where there is a Capitol and 12 Districts. The movie is about the struggles of a nation divided, where the districts must fight for survival and where the Capitol controls all of the districts. Each of the 12 districts must have one boy and one girl enter the 'Hunger Games', where they represent their District in a battle for their life, while their citizens watch the action live as it happens. Twenty-four entrants, but only 1 will survive. Its reality TV at its absolute worst. The main characters that we learn most about are Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence, X-Men: First Class) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island), who are from District 12, the poorest of the 12 districts. They are also my favorite characters. I like Peeta, because he is the underdog of all underdogs, and he wanted to stay true to himself and not let the games change him in any way. I love Kat, because she is a great role model for young girls like me. She is smart and courageous and she is always looking out for those who need her. She shows that just because you may not be the richest, or best looking, or most liked person, if you have the will and fight to survive, you can overcome any obstacle. I loved this movie so much, it's hard to pinpoint any one scene I like the most. The scenes leading up to game really set the tone of the movie. Then you have the training scenes, which too are very well done. I would say the scenes during the actual Hunger Games are my favorite, as that is where the most action occurs. The way the Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley, Gone) controls the Games using hi-tech computer technology, was fantastic. This movie had me on the edge of my seat and had my emotions all over the place. The cinematography in the Capitol and the arena was amazing. One of the best special effects was how they made it look like Kat and Peeta were on fire as they entered the arena, and then later in the interview, they again made it appear that Kat's dress was on fire when she spun around for the crowd. While the movie contained some graphic violence, it was necessary to stay true to the storyline. It was no worse than a lot of video games that kids play today, it's just difficult to watch kids killing other kids. For me, I not only want to see the film again, but I started reading the books as well, so I can compare them when the next film is released. I think this movie is appropriate for ages 11 and up, though for some younger kids, the few short instances of violence are intense and graphic, but they are short lived. I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars, but only because I can't give it more than that. Even my dad stayed awake throughout the whole movie and that never happens! 'May the odds be ever in your favor!'",10,1,9,3 August 2012
42," Inspirational, Educational and Humorous Story of An American Legend
","'42' tells the story of the American legend Jackie Robinson, the first African-American major league baseball player. This film takes place in the 1940s when racism and segregation were very prominent, so Jackie has to overcome many challenges and deal with the doubt and judgment people have towards him. With the support of journalist Wendell Smith (Andre Holland), Rachel Robinson (Nicole Beharie) and Dodger's owner Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), Jackie proves he has what it takes to make it.I really love this film. Not only is '42' educational, but it also has a sense of humor, wit and a whole lot of inspiration. This film captures the hardships that not only Jackie and his family dealt with, but also the hatred that was shown towards the people that supported him. I really like the cinematography and the way the camera angles are able to capture the movement of the players and the unspoken communication between the team members. The costume and set design is also very well done and accurate for that time period.My favorite character is Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) because he really shows emotion in a realistic way. Jackie is faced with challenge after challenge, but always overcomes, and Chadwick did a phenomenal job of displaying all that was going through his characters mind with nothing but a simple expression. Chadwick also captured Jackie's spunk and defiance towards the norms. Jackie Robinson is such an inspirational person and character. At any given moment he could have given up, let down the people that looked up to him, believe all the hate that was thrown at him, but he didn't, and that's what makes him a hero. I believe Jackie is a character that every man, woman and child can look up to and find inspiration in.My favorite scene is when Jackie plays one of his first games as a Dodger. The manager of the opposing team is very slanderous and vile towards Jackie. He calls out awful racial slurs while Jackie is out on the field, but Jackie knows if he did anything about it he would be the one who gets punished. Finally after the other Dodgers had enough, Eddie Stanky marched over to the opposing team and told the manager to sit down. He knows he is breaking the rules, but when he sees a team member of his being harped on he takes a chance and stands up of for him. This scene shows that the color of one's skin doesn't matter and that Eddie would have done that for any one of his teammates. It's a wonderful example of equity and sportsmanship and it is very moving.I give '42' 5 out of 5 stars because it is touching, funny, educational and inspirational. It's rated PG-13 which I agree with because it does run a bit long and younger children may find it hard to sit through, but it also contains a lot of racial slurs and slanderous language that may be hard for children to understand.

Star Trek Into Darkness," Hits it Out of the Park! Filled with Comedy and Action
","Satirical, Emotional and Epic are the only words to describe the new movie Star Trek Into Darkness. I got a chance to visit the Paramount lot for an exclusive screening of this movie, which left me in awe and thrill. Although this movie is a sequel to the previous Star Trek series, movie goers who are not familiar with the story will understand the plot clearly. The actors portray their characters very well thanks to the director, J.J Abrams. The scenery and set for the futuristic year of 2240 are so vivid and realistic, audience members will forget they are in the year 2013. This movie is also produced for the IMAX 3D, which puts all the explosions and fight scenes in your face. The relationship of all the characters on the iconic Starship Enterprise are deep and meaningful. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachery Quinto) develop a brotherly love through the struggles they conquer. The Villain, Khan (Benedict Cumberpatch) is a scary two-faced character that will leave the audience guessing his fate until the very end. Not only does the main star achieve his role perfectly, but the co-stars also do an superb job. The writers, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof successfully add comedy in the script to bring an emotional roller coaster to the audience. The set ranges from modern skyscrapers to futuristic spaceships. The designers portrayed the theme very well, using many computer generated images to create the year of 2240 in a way that makes it seem so real. The 3D element is an added bonus because it brings the action up close. The beginning scene has lots of running and fighting sequences and yet it is all filmed in such detail that the characters seem like they are going to run off screen.After watching this movie, my passion for Star Trek has been sparked! I rate this movie 5 out of 5 because it balances the comedy and action scenes so well. It has multiple themes taking place but the on-going theme 'the power of friendship can build you or destroy you' is present throughout. This movie contains a hand-full of violence but is not bloody or graphic. The action sequences, violence and realistic make-up could be scary for younger audience members so, I recommend this for ages 13 to18. This movie has sparked an interest in Star Trek for me and hopefully, it will do the same to you. Reviewed by Patrick N, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10,5,15,20 May 2013
Finding Nemo," 'Finding Nemo' Rides the Waves Again in 3-D
","Finding Nemo, the 2003 film that captured hearts and won the Best Animated Feature Oscar in 2004, has gotten a studio makeover and has been filling movie theaters in its 3-D version. This is a perfect film for you to share with your youngest grandchildren although you should be aware that there are some frightening scenes that 2 and 3-year-olds may find disconcerting. Here is what our KIDS FIRST! Film Critics had to share about the film: 'I thought the 3-D was cool,' says KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Anthony Aranda, age 10, who goes on to say there wasn't enough of it: 'Â… but they needed to add more 3-D parts to the movie.' Fellow youth film critic Cheyenne Nguyen, age 8, was captivated by the cinematography and visual effects, sharing, 'The clear and crisp color with 3-D is magical. It feels like I am snorkeling and ready to touch these sea creatures.' Morgan Bertsch, age 7, thought that the 3-D makes all the characters really come to life. 'It was amazing. It made you feel like you were really in the ocean. Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.' The father's long journey from the safety of his coral reef home through the vastness of the ocean to where Nemo had been taken in Australia is fraught with danger and even earns him fame among the other creatures of the sea. He gains a sidekick early on his quest whose short-term memory loss balances the mood with heavy doses of humor. Finding Nemo 3D Reviewed by Cheyenne Nguyen and Morgan Bertsch See their full review on video. http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=XRhQ87qMeh0 Watching Finding Nemo 3D by Disney-Pixar is like you are snorkeling and looking through your goggles and enjoying the colorful fish and sea life. This story is about Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), an overprotective father of Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould), a clown fish with a defective fin. It all starts with Coral and Marlin, Nemo's mom and dad looking at all 400 eggs and trying to determine names for each of the eggs. Suddenly, a barracuda comes to the coral and knocks Marlin unconscious. When Marlin wakes up, the reef is empty; with no fish around, the only egg left under the coral is Nemo. Marlin becomes a very protective dad and will not let Nemo out of his sight. However, Nemo is the opposite of his dad. He always wants to swim into the unknown. On the first day of school, Nemo wanders off outside the reef and is captured by a dentist. This starts Marlin's journey to find his son. He swims as fast as he can and asks for help finding Nemo. The only fish that stops to help Marlin is Dory (voice by Ellen DeGeneres). Dory has a big heart and always positive. The only problem is she has short- term memory loss. The story line is the father and son love, unpredictable and very funny. There are so many punch lines in this movie that will keep you laughing throughout the movie. The clear and crisp color with 3-D is magical. It feels like I am snorkeling and ready to touch these sea creatures. I can see the layers of rainbow coral reef, several rows of teeth in the mouth of Bruce the shark, the pelican's beak, and jellyfish seem so soft and real. The best 3-D part is with the whale and the krill swimming toward the audience. I love how production and design make Dory velvety, Marlin and Nemo soft and gummy. The rest of the fish are metallic, typical scaly fish. This makes Dory, Marlin and Nemo more lovable. The sound effects of water sloshing and crashing are very realistic. The only part I did not like is what happens to Nemo's mom. Will Disney come back with Nemo reunited with his mom? The lessons in this movie are Marlin deals with his fear and swims all the way to Australia to find his son, Nemo, and he learns to have faith. My favorite character is Dory with her big heart and Crush the laid-back father turtle and his children. The message of this movie is listens to your parents â€” they only try to protect you and give you good advice. Parents are alive longer so they know a lot more than their children. I rank this movie five out of five stars. I give this film an age range of 3 and up.",10,1,2,29 October 2012
Rise of the Guardians," 'Rise of the Guardians' Brings More Great 3-D to Theaters
","Two of our KIDS FIRST! Film Critics reviewed it. See below: Morgan Bertsch - Video review: http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=o28lnEuBM6QI have seen a lot of movies, and this movie had the most amazing graphics and best 3-D I have ever seen. I felt like I was in the same room as the scenes. The snowflakes come right at you and make you feel like it is really snowing on you. The Man in the Moon needs the help of The Guardians to defeat the evil Pitch. The Guardians are amazing. The animators and writers did a stupendous job of creating believable characters. The Guardians consist of Santa, who is from Russia. He is jolly and lives in an amazing castle. He has the cutest elves with jingle bells on their heads. They are very funny and helpful. The Easter Bunny is tough. He's from Australia and has a boomerang. His adorable eggs actually have legs and can run around. The Tooth fairy is very different. She is a bird. She has pink wings and blue and green feathers. Her baby birds that help her are the sweetest little creatures. The Sandman is the one who makes all your dreams come true while you are sleeping. The graphics for his amazing talents were fabulous.Jack Frost was one of my favorites. Everything he touches turn into frost. The animation of the frost covering everything was absolutely beautiful.Pitch wants the world to be dark and sad and to lose all hope. The children keep the world safe by having hope. Santa has a magic globe, which is bright with lights as long as the children believe, but once they stop believing their light goes out.The intricate design of the scenery was the best I have ever seen. Everything, from the smallest detail to the large wandering dinosaurs, is breathtaking. This movie is humorous, adorable and magical. My favorite scenes are when the Easter Bunny goes on a sleigh ride with Santa Clause and also when the baby eggs are running around. The sandman's magic makes your heart glow. The message is to stop and find out what makes you special. You have to find out what it is that you do best and find your center so you know how to make yourself and others happy.I love this movie. It mixes up holidays, so you can watch it year around and get into the mood for the seasons.I recommend this for ages 6 and up. Pitch is frightening. The over-sized Santa might be too much for the little ones because â€” I am not joking â€” he looks like you are right next to him.I give this movie five *****out of five twinkling stars.Review by Cheyenne Nguyen - Video review: http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=-PS_XegUGC0This is a magical movie with all the favorite childhood guardians comes together to protect the children. This is another great movie from DreamWorks. Santa Clause (Alec Baldwin), Easter Bunny (Hugh Jack man), Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Sandman and Jack Frost (Chris Pine) are chosen by the man in the moon to guard the children. They make sure that all children have wonderful dreams and faith. The more the children believe in the guardians the more power they have.However, the Boogie man (Jude Law) rise to take over the sweet dreams and create nightmares. Children are beginning to lose faith in the guardians. Without faith or believes, the guardians will disappear and the lights will turn off and the earth will be filled with darkness. This is when the guardians join forces to fight the Boogie man. However, Jack Frost did not join forces to fight. He just wanted to have fun and not worry about anything. There are so many funny lines in this movie. My favorite part of the movie is when the Tooth Fairy looks at the collection of teeth; she knows which one flosses and who it belongs to. The part I did not like is the Boogie man seems so real and I don't want to see him when I sleep.The 3D special effects in this movie are so clear it is unbelievable. When Jack Frost is flying it feels like you flying with him and actually feels the cold air. The rivers of colors are so bright and clear. However, the music is so and so, not very exciting. The lesson in this movie is finding your passion and you will know your purpose in life. The customs are so awesome. Especially the Fairies and Santa and his elves. The message in this movie is joining forces can be more powerful than being by yourself.My favorite character is Jack Frost. He's very fun to be around. I rank this movie 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 3 and up.",9,3,6,21 November 2012
Aquaman," Powerful Message About Being the Best You Can Be
","I really like this film because the message is so powerful. It's about training to be the best you can be. Then, when you are ready, your task is to beat anything that's in your way, with a humble heart because good always wins. Another reason why I like it is because of the action between Arthur and King Orm. These two teach that, no matter what the situation is, violence is never the answer. I also really like the background music because the suspense really moved me and made me want to jump out of my seat with excitement and joy.This amazing action/adventure film is about the city of Atlantis, which is now an underwater kingdom ruled by the power-hungry king Orm. With his army by his side, King Orm plans to take over the remaining oceanic people to become the King of all oceans better known as the Oceanic Master, then to rule the surface world. Standing in Orm's way is his half-Human, half-Atlantean brother, Aquaman, known as half-breed. With help from Vulko, who is the royal counselor of the throne, Aquaman must retrieve the powerful trident of Atlan to proclaim the title as the protector of the deep blue sea.The cast includes Arthur/Aquaman (Jason Momoa, Game Of Thrones), Atlanna (Nicole Kidman, Dead Calm), King Atlan (Graham McTavish, Outlander), Mera (Amber Heard, Never Back Down), King Orm (Patrick Wilson, Insidious), Vulko (Willem Dafoe, Spider-Man), Manta (Yahya Abdul-Manteen II, The Greatest Showman).My favorite part of this film is when Arthur finds out that he has the power to talk to the creatures in the water, in other words echolocation. Following that, Arthur doesn't know how to control the power that he has, which is why King Atlan puts Arthur in the hands of the royal counselor, Vulko, to learn to control his powers. From the training that Artur does with Vulko, Arthur shall use it in the future.Aside from that, King Orm plans to take things into his own hands and decides to conquer the seven seas to become King Of The Deep Blue Sea, also known as the Oceanic Master. After that, King Orm plans to take apart the surface world to become his treasure for good.I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18, as well as adults. Truly the whole family will love this film as it has so many funny and good reaction moments. This film also requires very good anthropomorphic qualities in various scenes. Don't miss this amazing action/adventure film directed by James Wan, which is playing in theaters now, to find out what happens at the end.Reviewed by Siaki S., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

My Neighbor Totoro," An instantly watchable animated masterpiece that holds new surprises from every time I watch it!
","Even after 25 years, My Neighbor Totoro remains an instantly watchable animated masterpiece that holds new surprises from every time I watch it.Satsuki and Mei are sisters who move to the Japanese countryside with their father. The children are fascinated with the quirks of their new house, as well as the vast nature around it. Satsuki goes to school and Mei begins to explore a fantastical world beneath a large tree in the backyard. She meets three little creatures and names one of them Totoro. Mei tells her sister about the adventure, but Satsuki does not believe her. During the next few days, the sisters discover more and more about their neighborhood and adjust to their new way of life.My Neighbor Totoro effortlessly crafts and develops so many different poignant stories. It is a coming-of-age tale, as well as a story about how we deal with change and one about the bond between two siblings. Totoro, his little pals, and the world they inhabit add a whole other layer to an already complete narrative. The magical elements intertwine with Satsuki and Mei's story. They bring light to the siblings, during a scary and dark time in their life. The elements of magic add some levity to less joyful parts of the film, giving just as much closure to the audience as to the characters.The film never reveals too much about Totoro and a lot about him remains a mystery even after the credits roll. He is so adorably drawn and never feels threatening. He has no dialogue, excluding a few grunts here and there, but is still one of my favorite things about this film. He brings a kind of magic that resonates with you every time he is on screen.The lesson of My Neighbor Totoro is to never lose faith in what you believe in. Mei's belief in the magic of Totoro never falters and for that, Totoro helps her and Satsuki not just because they are kind souls, but also because they both learn to believe in his magic.I give My Neighbor Totoro an age rating of 4 to 18. It appeals to all ages and has practically nothing objectionable for young audiences. I think adults will marvel at the spellbinding animation and wonderful story. I give My Neighbor Totoro 5 out of 5 stars and you need to see this special re-release if you haven't already fallen in love with this film.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

My Neighbor Totoro," Cute, funny and somehow realistic. An anime classic by Hayao Miyazaki
","The anime movie My Neighbor Totoro is cute and funny, yet somehow still realistic. Even though some parts are sad, that adds to the plot and makes the story even better. It starts with two sisters, 4-year-old Mei and 12-year-old Satsuki. When Mei runs off and meets a large, mischievous forest spirit named Totoro, their lives are changed forever. My Neighbor Totoro is directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Every scene is hand-drawn, unlike modern CGI movies. The rural setting and characters just feel real. In one scene, Mei trips and falls instead of running on. This gives a sense of reality, instead of edited perfection.The story starts when Mei, Satsuki and their father move to a new house while their mother is in the hospital. They soon discover that their house is inhabited by forest spirits, such as the soot gremlins. Nearby, Totoro lives in a huge camphor tree and a magical, eight-legged cat bus is a normal mode of transportation for them. After Satsuki and Mei get into an argument, Mei runs away. This part is so heartbreaking! With the help of Totoro...you'll see. The ending is a surprise you'll enjoy!Hayao Miyazaki has also directed other enjoyable anime movies, such as Kiki's Delivery Service and Spirited Away. Recently, Hayao Miyazaki came out of retirement. I, for one, cannot wait to see another Miyazaki directed film!
My Neighbor Totoro is cute, funny and realistic. However, I feel that something is missing. Totoro sounds like the main character, but he is on the screen for only a few scenes. Therefore, the movie somehow seems incomplete. The fact that I want more from it only proves how captivating it is.Overall, My Neighbor Totoro is an amazing movie. In 1988, when this movie came out, anime was not that popular. My Neighbor Totoro set off a craze for anime in the U.S. that has not stopped yet. The special features unravel the magic by describing how the characters were created, the real life inspiration for the movie's unique locations and more.I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 8 to 12. If you enjoy anime, cute and quirky characters, or just a realistic movie, check this out!Reviewed by Eden T., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Thor: Ragnarok," Excellent action and style. Great acting and direction. Captures details with an 80s retro feel
","Thor: Ragnarok impressed me because of its excellent action and style. The acting is top level and the wonderful direction captures every detail with an 80s retro feel. This is sure to be a crowd-pleaser for all Marvel fans.The story is about Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the God of Thunder and former Avenger, who finds himself in the toughest match of his life when he is pitted against Hela (Cate Blanchett), the Goddess of Death, who destroys his hammer in a fierce battle. Thor escapes through a space portal, but is transported to Sakaar, a planet known for its gladiator matches hosted by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum). Imprisoned, Thor is forced to fight on the gladiator ring, only to find out his opponent is the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), who is unaware of their previous comradery. Meanwhile on Asgard, Hela is the new leader and executes a strict dictatorship. Despite being captured, Thor is trying to set up a team with the Hulk, Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to escape and stop Hela before it is too late.Chris Hemsworth, as Thor, excellently presents his desperation, despite being a hero of great power. His new-born comradery with the Hulk is well presented, due to their great chemistry. Cate Blanchett, as Hela, is one of the best villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, due to her nefarious behavior and interesting backstory that shines a new light on Asgard's history. Mark Ruffalo, as the Hulk, is excellent in his Jekyll-Hyde personality between being Bruce Banner and being the Hulk. Due to this, he is my favorite character in the movie. Jeff Goldblum, as the Grandmaster, is quirky and fun like always. Tessa Thompson, as Valkyrie, provides an initially flawed companion to Thor, but stops running away from her problems and face them, when she decides to team up with Thor. Tom Hiddleston, as Loki, is as deceptive and charismatic as ever.The direction by Taika Waititi is splendid. Every scene in the movie is filled with style and well-timed comedy. My favorite scene is when Thor activates his true potential in the final battle against Hela because it is a huge leap for the character, and it leads to one of the most epic battles in the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. My only problem with the movie is the tonal shifts the movie faces because the movie is filled with comedic scenes. However, in serious and emotional scenes, they feel rout of place. The message of the movie is about believing in yourself. Thor is only able to last in the battle with Hela when he realizes his true potential is beyond his hammer. I give this film 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 because of its intense action and suggestive references. Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Ready Player One," An epic, nostalgic film filled to the brim with pop culture
","Ready Player One is an epic, nostalgic film filled to the brim with pop culture references. It has characters you can really connect to and a digital world we all dream about. It has all sorts of exiting scenes such as races, puzzles, battles and so many others. This film is based on the book Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. They adapted the book very smoothly into film.Ready Player One takes place in the year 2045. James Halliday creates the OASIS, a completely virtual world that everyone uses to escape their reality. After his death, a competition begins to find the Easter egg in the OASIS. Whoever finds the egg will have complete control over the OASIS. Wade and his friends try to win this competition and stop IOI from beating them for total control of the OASIS. It is filled with twists that make it hard to predict what will happen next even after reading the book.I loved all the references in this film. Just to note some there was the Iron Giant, King Kong, Batman, The DeLorean and Martin the Martian. The special effects were also incredible. I really enjoyed the effect whenever someone changed their skin in the OASIS. I also enjoyed the mix between animated and live action characters. This is impressive because it's hard to make these two styles be near each other without one being out of place. I really liked how the world seemed like a fantasy people have today yet is also a dystopia at the same time.My favorite part was the introduction to the OASIS. This scene was really impressive and had so much squeezed in. I also liked the scene were the common people attacked IOI. These scenes both showed a huge variety of different characters all from different parts of pop culture.
I enjoyed Mark Rylance's acting in this film. He filled the role of James Halliday brilliantly. He was very erratic yet sincere and made the character relatable even in extreme circumstances. The song choices in this film were great. I particularly enjoyed the use of the original King Kong theme.Overall, I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and strongly recommend it to anyone ages 7 through 18 because people under 7 wouldn't be entertained by all the references if they haven't experienced the things being referred to. I also believe adults will strongly enjoy it.Reviewed by Rohan F., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",10,0,1,12 April 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," Great Family Film That Belongs in Your Home Library
","Paramount Pictures now offers you on DVD and Blu-ray last year's theatrical hit, The Adventures of Tintin. Racking up an impressive list of award nominations, including an Oscar for the music, the film took home the International Animated Film Association's Annie Award for Animated Effects in an Animated Production. The characters, although animation, look more like real people than cartoon. In fact, twelve-year-old KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Brianna Beaton says, 'I almost forget that I am watching an animated film, and several times I get lost in the moment and think it's real life.'See Brianna's full review on video.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsaNqmAYnzQThis is a great animated film! I absolutely love it. The Adventures of Tintin has lots of action and mystery, and will keep you on the edge of your seat. I almost forget that I am watching an animated film, and several times I get lost in the moment and think it's real life. I like Snowy, Tintin's dog, because he is very loyal and will go anywhere with Master. The fearless reporter, Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell), and Captain Haddock (voiced by Andy Serkis) set off on an adventure, hunting for a sunken ship, the Unicorn, which had been commanded by Haddock's ancestor. Trying to find three scrolls, which contain clues to where the treasure is hidden, Tintin and his new friend, the Captain, become closer and closer friends as they get deeper and deeper into their adventure. Steven Spielberg (War Horse) directs this outstanding film and reminds me there is a little kid in all of us. This film sends a great message that sometimes you just need someone to rely on when going through your own adventure. I recommend this film for ages 8 to 13. And because of all the suspense and tons of action it has, I give this film 5 out of 5 stars. The Adventures of Tintin is truly a great treasure and a must-see, so get your copy on DVD or Blu-ray and enjoy the adventure!",10,2,3,14 March 2012
Moana," Spectacular animation, beautiful and fun characters, wonderful story
","I could feel the warm breeze blowing through my hair, the fresh air and the smell of the ocean. The animation is incredible. The characters are fun, energetic, believable and just make you feel happy. Moana's adventure with the help of the dem-god Maui is inspirational humorous and genius.The cast is magnificent. A young girl named Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) is trying to find out who she is and what her purpose in life should be. Moana is my kind and courageous new princess who longs to do things no one has done before and try the unexpected. I adore her because she is so fun-loving and adventurous. Plus, she reminds me of myself and how I am adventurous and a friend to all. She is a great role model for girls because she learns to do many things she thought she never could. Even when she is scared, she mustards up the courage and conviction she needs. Auli'i Cravalho has the perfect voice for this part which involves many new songs that I loved. The demi-god Maui (Dwayne Johnson) is a perfect choice. He does everything he can to show how awesome and cool he is with his fabulous hook strength, gorgeous hair and good looks. I think he is lovable but he needs a push, or two or three, to do the right thing. Who knew Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) could sing? He can and I enjoyed his songs.The evil crab, Tamatoa (Jemaine Clement) is silly sly and very boastful. Stay after the end credits and you will see the funniest clip ever. You might recognize Jemaine Clement's voice from the movie BFG as one of the giants. He is one of our very odd shinny villains who sings. Gramma Tala (Rachel House) is one of the best Grandmas you will ever meet. She can tell that Moana has a connection to the ocean and she tries to help her fulfill her destiny while avoiding her son, Chief Tui (Temuera Morrison). Moana's father who wants her to stay home to be a princess and take care of the people who are part of their tribe. He learns that he has to let go, listen to his daughter and let her leave the nest and follow her heart and dreams so she can be free doing what she loves. The animation is spectacular with each and in every detail, an animator's passion shows. It makes you feel like you are seeing the ocean and the islands because the vivid and crystal clear rendition. The water at night and the islands are terrific and breathe taking. This stupendous film made me want to go island hopping with Moana and Maui.My favorite scene is when Moana and Maui are on the boat talking and Maui tells Moana a secret about his life. I won't give any spoilers, but this is a scene to watch for. I love it because it is so heart- felt and it just made me want to hug someone, tell them a secret and cry. You can really tell that Moana and Maui have a connection and care for each other deeply. I recommend this for kids age 6 to 18 and adults will enjoy it too. Kids will love the animation and fun-filled characters. There is a crazy chicken that will keep them laughing. The villains are not too scary. They will enjoy the comedy and quick one liners throughout the film. Adults will love the messages, the animation and the story. I give this film 5 out of 5 oceanic waves and stars.",Null,2,12,21 November 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Greatest Reboot Ever in Marvel Cinematic Universe
","Spider-Man Homecoming is the greatest reboot that ever happened in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is a clever and incredibly funny film. It takes place two months after Captain America: Civil War. Spider-Man wants to become part of the Avengers, however Tony Stark thinks he isn't ready because he is a child and still needs to learn from his mistakes. Peter Parker tries to juggles being a high school kid with being a hero. Also in this film, Peter tries to stop a group of men from selling dangerous weapons to people.I love this film for the characters and their banter. Tom Holland makes Spider-Man, the teenager, very lovable and relatable. I like how they show Spider-Man as a bit immature and relaxed, unlike other films where Peter is too serious and the films feel pretty dark and grim. My favorite character is Ned (Jacob Batalon) because he asks Peter so many questions about Spider- Man and that makes it really funny to watch. Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Iron Man mentoring Peter is quite wonderful. Iron Man helps him but he doesn't take the focus away from Spider-Man. Spider-Man's constant banter in this film is also quite amusing. This film makes certain that Spider-Man can stand on his own in another sequel.There is one thing I did not like about this film and that is the storyline about his crush. It really doesn't develop and it seems that it is only there as filler. Besides that the film is great.I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to ages 8 to 18. I think adults might like this as well. This film does contain intense scenes and some inappropriate language, making it unsuitable for younger viewers. This is a 'know your kid' movie. I recommend it to people who like action, adventure, comedy, films based on books and family movies. This is a movie worth seeing and I guarantee you will not only like this film, you will love it.Reviewed by Ryan R., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10,25,59,30 June 2017
The Book Thief," Gives a Youth Perspective of Surviving the Holocaust
","I bet you have seen many movies that have narration but I bet you  haven't seen one like this. In this movie, the narrator is Death.  The Book Thief is about a young girl whose brother dies and her mother  abandons her - all at the age of 11. She's adopted by an older couple  in Nazi Germany. Her foster father teaches her how to read which lights  a fire inside of her to read and read and read. Again, since this is  Nazi Germany, books are very hard to find. The only way she can get  more books is to 'borrow' them. Also, her family agrees to hide a young  Jewish man in their basement which puts the young girl's family at  great risk. But, the young girl and the young man become very good  friends, helping each other through hard times. During this time, there  are many people dying so Death is very nearby and has a lot to say. The  Book Thief is all told from Death's perspective.  The lead characters are the young girl, Liesel Meminger played by up-  and-coming actress Sophie Nelisse and her foster father and mother  played by Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson. These characters try to live  a normal life while fighting for it.  One of my favorite scenes is when a friend of Liesel's, Rudy, goes to  the running track and covers himself in mud so he can look like Olympic  Track Star Jessie Owens. I like this scene because it shows how Rudy  didn't believe what Hitler was saying and supported Liesel and her  family.  The look and sound of this film helps convey the emotional story of  Liesel and her friends and family. The sets and costumes are all  beautiful and really portray 1940s Germany. The music is sad but also,  hopeful. The cinematography is beautiful and also lets us see the  harshness of their lives.  The message of this movie is 'to stand up for what you believe and  don't let a group of people tell you otherwise.'  I recommend this movie to ages 9 and up. Although this is a sweet  passionate film it does take place in Nazi Germany which includes  violence and death.  I give this movie five out of five stars because the idea of having the  narrator be Death really grabbed my attention and held my attention to  this unbelievable story to the very end.

Suicide Squad," Awesome soundtrack, unbelievable acting, intriguing storyline, great cast
","With the awesome soundtrack, unbelievable acting, intriguing story line and perfect cast members, this film is one I definitely recommend seeing. The film is about an assembled team of the most dangerous villains in the world who are sent on a mission to defeat a bigger evil entity. The film's twist on typical superhero movies really stands out as the antagonists take the spotlight for once. The squad is composed of fearless felons with nothing to lose. Their actions, hidden agendas and intentions are absolutely unpredictable. One of the best aspects of this movie is the cast and their outstanding acting. Margot Robbie's role as Harley Quinn is jaw dropping and Jared Leto deserves lots of credit for his performance as the Joker. They played their roles so amazingly well that it was hard for me to imagine them as people outside of their roles here. Their facial expressions, from scene to scene, is unbelievable. All of the characters' portrayals are amazing. Deadshot, played wonderfully by Will Smith, provides a comedic and emotional aspect as he tries to hold a loving relationship with his daughter throughout the main conflict. What makes the characters so memorable and the film intriguing is that each one has its own twisted story and talent. The soundtrack is awesome and the film's use of lot of good songs made certain scenes especially memorable. Overall, this film is a fun movie and, if you go in to see it with no specific expectation or comparison with another film, I can't imagine anyone not liking it. The idea may have been typical but the execution was superb. Sure people argue that it is just another superhero movie and make many comparisons to other superhero films, but I think the style this film has, including the acting, music, camera work and visuals puts this film above others. I recommend this film for people ages 13 to 18 and think adults will enjoy it as well, especially those who like twisted, psychotic and creepy vibes because, although I am not a fan of action movies, the psychotic and creepy feel made it really interesting for me. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Harmony M, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",8,0,1,25 August 2016
Elf," Touching Yet Funny
","Elf is the story of a human named Buddy who was raised by elves in the North Pole at Santa's Workshop. When Buddy becomes an adult, he is told that he was adopted so he goes on a quest to find his father in New York City.This movie is hilarious. Will Ferrell is perfect for the role of buddy! He really portrays the character's sweetness with a comedic touch. One of the reasons I love this film so much is that it really captures what it would be like to take someone who has lived in fantasy land and throw them into the hustle and bustle of the big city. There are several montages throughout the film. My favorite would have to be when Buddy comes to New York for the first time because he does such bizarre things. If I were to see him eating the gum of the hand rail or playing in a revolving door in my town, I would think he was crazy! I end up feeling bad for Buddy because he is so clueless to how the real world works.Another thing that makes this movie so hysterical is that in the North Pole the props, costumes, sets and back drop are so elementary and simple, it really accentuates the innocence and comical quality of the elf world. Also, in the North Pole, there are some animals made of clay animation. Their design is very similar to the old Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer movie, and that warms my heart and makes me laugh.This movie is perfect for family night, watching with friends or when you just need a laugh. This story is touching yet funny as Buddy goes on an amazing journey to get closer to his father's heart and bring back holiday spirit to all. This is a great film for all ages because it contains the fun innocence of an elf that children can enjoy and it also has a bit of adult humor for the older viewers. Although young children will love this movie, I think ages 7 and younger should watch this with an adult or older child because they may get slightly confused or frightened. Over all, this is a wonderful film, whether it's the holidays or not.Reviewed by Raven Devanney, age 13, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic",8,2,2,7 July 2011
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Off the Charts Special Effects!
","I heard there was a comic book where Captain America is a soldier working with another super hero before he turned into a super human and all. I expected movie to be like that but I was brutally wrong. 'Captain America: Winter Soldier' is a cool movie many Marvel fans would enjoy. This film has a good amount to offer for all fans. This blockbuster includes action, romance, conspiracy, adventure, comedy, thrill and, of course, super heroes. The story starts when Captain America is doing his thing saving everyone. Soon, however Shield starts to act more privately and a new project is being formed. Something is going on that that worries Captain America. What is it? And how does he fix it? To find the answer to these questions you must watch the movie. This movie has a great cast and a great concept. However, because we all know how amazing this super hero is, the ending is somewhat predictable. Some moments drag a bit but the special effects are completely off the charts. The story line is nice. However, I would have liked this movie more if it wasn't told from Captain America's point of view. I think this film would be fantastic if it was told from Nick Fury's point of view. Some camera shots are so fast that they are a bit difficult to follow but overall, the special effects are spectacular! The technology alone in this movie will satisfy even the most discerning sci-fi fans. My favorite scene is when Captain America is in an elevator and all kinds of people equipped with weapons enter on different floors. This is when Captain America realizes for the first time that something is not right. Finally, Captain America asks, 'Does anybody want to get off before we start this?' Then, all people in the elevator attack him. It's an amazing action scene. I don't think this has ever been done before - such a complex fight scene in the tight space inside an elevator. The director and editors make the whole movie not only very engaging but very funny too with a great mix of emotions. This film has tons of action, gunplay, death and some intense violence, so I recommend it for ages 9 to 18 and I would rank it 4 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by KIDS FIRST Film Critic Gerry O.

They are all in one of the small life boats trying to stay alive. After a while it only becomes Pi and Richard Parker who are adrift in the Pacific Ocean. Pi is now trying to survive, but is in fear of Richard Parker. Based on the best-selling novel by Yann Martel, this adventure is created in 3D and is one of my new favorites. The visual effects are amazing and capture the marine life really well with all its beautiful colors. I like the way this film is set up like someone is telling it as a story, this really keeps my attention. One of my favorite scenes is when a big whale comes out of the ocean; it is so big and pretty to see. It is incredible. I also like the way we learn how the Tiger is named Richard Parker. It is somewhat funny and unusual. I would love to know How Director, Ang Lee, directs all the animals in this film, it is truly amazing how they act. David Magee, (Screenplay writer) is doing a remarkable job on transforming a great novel into an amazing script. Other casts in Life of Pi include Vibish Sivakumar (Ravi Patel) and Rafe Spall (The Writer). A big message I found is to never lose hope no matter where you are in life. Pi is in the middle of the ocean for many many days with a big storm, and a Tiger, but thru it all he never loses hope to be rescued. I recommend this film for ages 8 to adults. Younger ages may be a little frightened when they see some of the animal scenes, but other than that, this is a must see. You can enjoy it with your family and friends. I give Life of Pi 5 out of 5 stars. I love the message and the visual effects. This is a great story of hope and determination. Believe the unbelievable and see the amazing adventure in Life of Pi, it triumphs into theaters on November 21. by Brianna Hope Beaton, age 13, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10,4,8,8 January 2013
Tangled," Classic story with a twist that appeals to kids
","Tangled, Disney's newest Princess fairy tale is based on the classic Rapunzel story. You know, the girl with the long hair, trapped in the tower? Tangled stars Mandy Moore, who has a voice like an angel. She is brave but shy because she's never stepped foot out of her tower. Zachery Levi, as the male lead, Flynn Rider, is no Prince Charming. He's a scamp, even a thief! But that's what makes him interesting.I love all the fabulous new songs by the great Alan Menken, who created the musical magic of 'The Little Mermaid,' 'Enchanted,' and 'Beauty and the Beast' along with many other Disney classics. The movie starts with 'When Will My Life Begin,' a sing-a-long song that really gets you going. It tells how Rapunzel is frightened of the real world but excited to give it a try. The song 'Mother Knows Best' sets the stage for the horrible tangle Rapunzel finds herself in. She wants to obey her mother, but her heart tells her to follow her dream, even if it leads to trouble.I give this movie five-out-of-five stars, and recommend it for all ages. My Dad didn't think he'd like it, but he was smiling all the way through. (I think he saw a little of himself in that rascal Flynn Rider). If you like a classic story, great songs and one BIG adventure, this is the DVD for you. Fun, fun, fun for the whole family! Reviewed by Makai Weber Colvin, Age 9, KIDS FIRST!

Lion," A Captivating Story about Family and Perseverance
","Lion is a beautifully produced film that truly captivated my heart and became one of my favorite movies. This film captures everything that I look for in a film. It is filled with emotional, heart-touching scenes, a powerful message and wonderful cinematography. It is very unique and special, very different from what you ordinarily see at the cinema. The story tells about 5-year-old, vulnerable Indian boy Saroo who gets lost on a train and travels thousands of miles across India away from his dear family. Saroo faces many hardships of life all by himself. Eventually he is taken in and adopted by a caring Australian couple. Years later Saroo feels a part of himself missing and is filled with murky memories of his past as a young child in India. Using Google Earth, Saroo is determined and passionate to find his lost family through the use of this tool.The lovable and kind Saroo is played by the talented Dev Patel who also had the leading role in the Oscar winning film Slumdog Millionaire. Dav Patel portrays Saroo's passionate determination to be reunited with his family and country in the most believable way. Rooney Mara plays adult Saroo's girlfriend who aids him finding his family. Sue Brieerley, Saroo's adopted mother is portrayed by Nicole Kidman in another stunning performance.The film runs 120 minutes and I have many favorite scenes, but what touched me most is watching the passion that drives Saroo to find his family. Although he faces many hardships and issues, his love and passion for his family drives him to not quit but overcome every obstacle. Seeing his dedication to be reunited with his roots is inspiring. The message of this film touched my heart, due to similar personal experience I share with Saroo. As someone who also left their motherland at age six to come to a country with better opportunities I, like Saroo, know how it feels to be reunited with your motherland and have only mercury memories from where you come from. So I relate very deeply to the message of not forgetting your origin and staying true to your background and roots. In addition, the film portrays the message of family and unity which are dear to me as well.I highly recommend this film and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and expect to see this film be nominated for an Oscar.Reviewed by Maria G., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Bohemian Rhapsody," This movie completely changed my perspective of the band and the script is absolutely amazing.
","Before seeing this movie, I was mostly neutral about Queen. I did like their songs, but I was never really a fan. However this movie completely changed my perspective of the band. Even though I only knew the most famous songs, that doesn't matter. You don't need to be a fan to enjoy this film. It belongs to everyone, like Queen does.The story follows Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek), the lead singer of Queen, and his rise to fame, but also his fall from grace. It sounds really simple, but the other aspects of the movie, such as the writing and acting, really set it apart from other similar films.First, the script is amazing. Kudos to the script writer, Anthony McCarten. There are so many scenes in this movie that are genuinely full of tension particularly scenes showing the band arguing and practically any scene with Paul Prenter (Allen Leech). The writing really helps deliver tension in the darker scenes and make the more uplifting scenes really motivating. The writing makes you feel Freddie's downward spiral. The scenes with Paul especially made me genuinely nervous. Because, you know he doesn't care about Freddie and he just wants to leech off of him. All you want is for Freddie to cut ties with Paul. Thankfully, this movie isn't a complete downer, as there are some genuinely heartwarming moments, especially in the beginning. Then, things get dark pretty quickly. It's nice seeing the band get together and hang out. You genuinely believe in their friendship.This movie also shows Freddie dealing with real issues - his race, his sexuality and not feeling like a disappointment to his parents. Life is complicated, whether or not you are rich and famous. We also got to give special attention to Freddie's actor. Rami Malek really is Freddie Mercury! It is so spot on that Rami Malek and Freddie Mercury look almost identical. That's what I call amazing casting. While the rest of the cast is really great as well, Rami Malek completely steals the show.This movie also excels at showing how destiny works in mysterious ways. For example, five minutes before Freddie asks to joined to the band, the lead singer quits. I find that really interesting. To be honest, the only issue I have with this movie is the final scene. It's a recreation of the Live Aid performance Queen did, which seems fine at first. However, the scene goes on forever. It is a good scene and I get why they made it so long, but after awhile I kept wondering how much longer the scene was going to last. That's really my only issue with the film. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, as well as adults. Even if you're not a huge Queen fan, I think you'll enjoy this.Reviewed by Calista B., KIDS FIRST!

Man of Steel," 'Man of Steel' Is Not Your Typical Superhero Flick
","If you have seen the Superman films and read the comics, you will hear about this film and think to yourself â€“ another Superman movie?! My moms are big fans of Superman so I was positive I knew what to expect. Well, I was in for a huge surprise.This movie is not at all like other movies about famous superheroes. It starts by showing where Superman is born on another planet and what happens to his home. It touches your heart to see what sacrifice his real parents go through in order to save his life.The movie shows Superman's life from a little kid to a grown man; how he has to adjust to Earth's atmosphere and learn to control his powers. Other kids think he is weird and pick on him, but his earth parents teach him to be patient and not to attract too much attention so he can grow up and fulfill his destiny. You probably would like to know what his destiny is, but you have to watch the movie to find out. The events, the storyline and amazing effects will blow your mind, especially if you get chance to see it in 3D.I like this film for number of reasons. The graphics and storyline are very engaging. I also think they couldn't have done a better job with the cast. The funny and courageous reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams), proud warrior and real father of our famous superhero Jor-El (Russell Crowe), Clark's earth father (Kevin Costner) and a new face on the Hollywood horizon, Henry Cavill, who plays Superman.My favorite scene is when Clark surrenders to FBI so he can save the Earth and while he is there, FBI agents observe him through a one-way mirror window. Superman has super powers so he can see through the glass. He starts making funny comments and shocks the FBI agents with his skills. But best of all is the reaction of the agents on the other side of the glass. You can see that they struggle to believe that this is real and they are also amazed and fascinated by Superman.I recommend this great movie to ages 10 and up. It has elements of violence and a bit of harsh language. The graphic depiction may be too intense for a younger audience. I love the film and would definitely enjoy watching it again, though it does get a little predictable in the last 15-20 minutes.Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Gerry O.

Trouble with the Curve," 'Trouble with the Curve' Goes Straight to the Heart
","Trouble with the Curve stars Clint Eastwood doing what he does so well: playing a crusty old man. Likable, of course. In fact, KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Anthony Aranda, age 10, says Eastwood's character, Gus, is his favorite in this movie. 'He is a good man that people should trust. He knows a lot about baseball and has a good heart.' To older audiences, the storyline may be predictable and even familiar, but Trouble with the Curve has plenty of heart throughout to give it its own life strength. And, Anthony says, 'The movie also has really good chemistry. Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams, who plays Gus's daughter, Mickey, work very well together.' Trouble with the Curve Reviewed by Anthony Aranda See his full review on video.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HaUEBtMf9s Trouble with the Curve is great and funny. It is kind of like an older movie meant for older audiences, but I still think it is great. This movie is about a man named Gus who is a baseball talent scout but he is losing his sight. He is old-fashioned and always relied on his sight and a feeling to pick good baseball players. Without his sight, he doesn't know how to scout, and even though he is having trouble he won't ask for help. His daughter comes to help him anyway and they have a good time together, but bad things happen, too. The main characters in the movie are Gus and Mickey. Gus is played by Clint Eastwood and Mickey is played by Amy Adams. Amy Adams is in another movie that my little sister loves, called Enchanted, and I also really like her in The Muppets. My favorite character in this movie is Gus because he is a good man that people should trust. He knows a lot about baseball and has a good heart. The movie also has really good chemistry. Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams work very well together. He kind of seems like a grumpy old man and she is kind of sweet. My favorite part in this movie is when Mickey meets a new guy who can throw a really good curve ball and, since she really loves baseball, they become really good friends. I would recommend this movie for ages 10 and up because my brother says that the movie was a little too old for him and he's seven. The movie also has some inappropriate language and situations that are too old for kids under 10.",9,2,5,29 October 2012
Bridge of Spies," Oscar Shout Out! Nothing short of Legendary and an Immediate Classic
","This film is nothing other than legendary and an immediate classic. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg are back together again, to make another incredible dramatic and genius film. With historical facts, a heartfelt and dramatic story, this film is not only bound to be an Oscar contender, but I think this film may swoop any other film this year, and win the film of the year award.This is a drama. Although it cracks jokes here and there, it really is primarily mainly a dramatic re-enactment of an historical event. The story itself is a large adventure with action and intense scenes filled with various human emotions and unpredictable actions that keep the viewer on the edge of their seat.The story starts in the middle of the Cold War, in Brooklyn. A man believed to be a Soviet Spy is arrested and, because of American law, he is supposed to get a fair trial. The man responsible for defending him in court starts noticing things and instead of just making it look like a fair trial, he actually tries to help this 'spy' get the right sort of action.I don't know how Steven Spielberg (director) does it but, he makes these stories come to life and helps you connect with the characters so that you cry, laugh and almost fall of your seat because it's so intense! The camera shots explore the scene from a variety of angles and go way beyond just showing one element. With each camera shot, you are prone to say, 'nice shot.' For example, in one scene, they are on a bridge and, instead of showing a sky high view as you might expect, he shows it from the prospective of the people. It is snowing; you can't see the other side or the people very well. You can just see a few lights and it is just so perfect. If you are a fan of Spielberg's work as I am, you will be happy to see some of his famous wide shots which help scenes seem to float into each other.As for the acting, Tom Hanks has done many roles and this is truly one of his best. He plays a character that does so many dangerous things and does them for a few people that he doesn't even know. He shows extraordinary skill portraying this character, bringing out emotions we can relate to. Full and heartfelt, with each scene his character gets better and better to the point that you are just sitting there with your eyes wide and forgetting to breathe thinking, 'What is he going to do next?'. When he is upset, you're upset. When he is terrified, you're terrified. He is perfect for this role and this is easily one of his best work.For this film, I cannot choose a favorite scene. Each scene is so important in its own way. Each scene is so spectacularly done. Each scene is so entertaining whether it's funny, intense or dramatic One of the scenes that was most impressive is when we see an American spy flying a plane, 70,000 feet over Russian territory. He is gathering intelligence and hoping to get some information about nuclear defenses. His plane is being attacked and the problem is, he was supposed to go down with the plane. The cockpit shatters and he goes into free fall. I love the scene because it looks like he is falling from 70,000 feet at an alarming rate. The execution of this is outstanding. It is clear and intense, which is why I love it so much.The subject of this film is rather mature like the scenes near East Berlin during the time the Berlin Wall was being constructed. A part of Berlin is cut off from food and everything else. There are many other scenes featuring the impact of the Cold War. Because of these, I recommend this for ages 11 to 18. I enthusiastically give it 5 out of 5 stars because this film is legendary. It is mind blowing in so many parts and, I believe it is one of the best films I have ever seen.Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10,1,4,14 October 2015
Kung Fu Panda 2," An Irresistible Action Comedy Adventure
","One of our KIDS FIRST! youth film critics reviewed this, 14-year-old Gabriella Chu from New York. She loved it and thought that kids, ages 8 and up would as well. View her videotaped review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZmOZ4FaCY4Or read her written review: The Kung Fu Panda is back with more adventure! This movie is an irresistible action comedy that's pure fun. In case you have not watched the first Kung Fu Panda before, the protagonist Po, is a panda who transforms from noodle shop employee to kung fu master joining the Furious Seven (a group of heroes who fight villains.) In this sequel, Po finds himself conflicted with his past. He starts to question where he has come from, and why his father is a goose instead of the panda. He also has to defeat evil Lord Shen, a peacock who plans to use a secret weapon to conquer China and destroy kung fu. Will Po be able to defeat Lord Shen even when conflicted with this past? You will have to watch this movie for yourself!Watching this movie in 3D felt so life-like, especially the action scenes. There are so many action sequences and they all are very intense. My favorite sequence is the one where Po finds his inner peace because the movie is in slow motion and incorporates scenes of his past as well as scenes from Master Shifu's technique of inner peace. The slow motion emphasized Po's technique, and made the scene much more interesting. I also thought the humorous voice of Po, Jack Black, is perfect for his role as a lively and entertaining panda. The movie also has inspiring messages such as: look to the future instead of the past, and discover who you are. However, I did not think this movie was as good as the first one. I did not find the story as touching and upbeat. I also didn't find the voices of the characters recognizable, except for Po and the Tigress's voice. In addition, the colors of the movie were not very vibrant. They did not fit the comical mood of the movie so much.Overall though, I think this is a great animated family comedy. I would recommend it to children ages 8 and up because younger kids might not be able to follow the storyline. You should definitely go see this if you are into adventure!Reviewed by Gabriella Chu, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic",Null,0,1,3 June 2011
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Captures Your Attention From The Get Go!
","What would you do if you could be a superhero? What if you have no choice? From the very beginning, Spider-Man: Into the Spicer-Verse is very energetic and captures your attention. This animated film has impressive visuals. The music creates a fantastic rhythm. And you just want to watch more.The story follows a high school student named Miles Morales, who just changed school. He goes into an abandoned subway station with his uncle Erin and gets bitten by a radioactive spider. Ever since that day, Miles starts sticking to everything he touches. Then, he meets Spider-Man (Peter Parker), teams up with some friends from the same dimension and they attempt to save the world from the villain Kingoin.The story is very original and makes the impossible possible. It takes all the abilities of Spider-Man to far and beyond with its action scenes. The film also shows a very real family atmosphere and the humor is smart. I love the non-traditional characters and how they embrace diversity. And yes! Spider-Man is Latino and surely does speak Spanish! There are also some fun new characters.With this film, Marvel has created a film that celebrates comics, film and visual arts. Of course, it celebrates Spider-Man and makes this super hero relevant and contemporary. It is absolutely eye-poppingly beautiful and really pushes the boundaries of the genre with its colors, textures and camera movements. There are several different forms of animation in one film. You feel as if you are actually reading a comic book or the comic book is coming to life.Naturally, the film does a very touching tribute to genius Stan Lee. I feel the filmmakers took some risks bringing new ideas to this iconic character which as been adored for over 50 years. The result is a must-see family movie that is even more appealing to new generations. I also love how this film is animated. It's so different. I've never seen a film like this one. I think it's very unique. Be sure to stay after the credits to see something very special, including another set of credits at the very end.This film sets a new era in animated movies. I recommend it for ages 5 to 18, as well as adults. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and include it in my Oscar predictions as a very possible winner. This is the film parents will love their kids to watch and kids will enjoy in many different ways.With great power comes great responsibility and we all can be heroes. This is the idea behind Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - inclusion for all in the vast universe and the idea that we can all be heroes by making the right choices and doing our best helping each other in our everyday life.Reviewed by Zoe C., KIDS FIRST!

Warrior," Not Just a Guy Movie, Quite Amazing
","I have to be honest, I was not looking forward to seeing this movie because I have never been interested in boxing or arena fighting of any kind, but this move is so much more than a cage fight.Right away you can see the tone of this movie from the steel yards of Pittsburgh and the grayness of Pennsylvania in the first scene. The cinematography is great because there is s much symbolism and depth to the visuals.My favorite scene is the final fight because it is so emotional and I cried so much. The music in that scene is also amazing because it really adds a deeper quality of emotion. When the movie first started, I thought I would give it 2 stars because I was expecting a typical boxing movie, but now I give Warrior 4 Â½ stars because it is so amazing.This movie is for 13 and up because although it's just a movie, the fighting is so realistic and graphic that it does a little disturbing. This movie is definitely not for everyone, but if you're looking for a deep emotional movie, or if you're in to MMA fighting, Warrior is perfect for you!

Divergent," Where Outcasts Have to Hide to Protect Themselves
","Based on the wildly successful novel by Veronica Roth, 'Divergent' tells the story of teens struggling to find their place in post-war Chicago. Society is separated by factions based on personality traits and virtues in attempts to keep the peace and encourage the population to participate equally in maintaining a functioning community. When a person turns 16, she takes a test to determine what faction best suits her characteristics to help her decide whether she should stay in her home faction or move elsewhere. Tris, played by Shailene Woodley, is a modest girl from Abnegation, but her entire life is turned upside down when the test reveals something about her she didn't know was possible. She is a Divergent, which means she does not fit into any category, therefore cannot be controlled and is a threat to the system. With the advice of an older faction member, she is warned not to tell a soul or her life will be at risk. Young Tris then decides to leave her home of Abnegation and transfer to Dauntless, a fiery group of individuals that show no fear and protect the people. There, she has to learn to fit in and test herself physically and mentally, all the while guarding a dark secret.I really like this film. I went into it not knowing anything about the book trilogy so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I was pleased with the outcome. The visuals are interesting because even though this film is set in the future and it features some advanced technology, everything is kept quite simple looking. There are, however, some flaws with the visuals and effects because at times it is very apparent that green screen is in use. The soundtrack is absolutely incredible. It features a variety of artist that I really enjoy and I've already downloaded music from the film because it is something I actually listen to on a daily basis which isn't the case with me for most motion picture soundtracks. My favorite character is surprisingly not one of the leads, but a supporting role. I like the character Will, played by Ben Lloyd-Hughes, who is a boy Tris meets during her training in Dauntless. Will is a sweet, kind-hearted person who is always very supportive of Tris and her friend Christina, played by Zoe Kravitz. He is very level headed and is someone you can always count on. I had the pleasure of meeting Ben Lloyd-Hughes and I think he is perfect for the role of Will. The rest of the cast works very well together. Shailene Woodley does a great job portraying her emotions and showing Tris's character development. She goes through quite a lot over the course of the film and Shailene is really able to embody Tris and show how she transforms from a timid, modest Abnegation, to a fearless young woman who is not defined by anyone or anything. The only problem I have with the casting is that Four, played by Theo James, is supposed to be 18 in the book series. However in the film, he appears to be in his mid 20's, since Theo is 29 years old. He does a wonderful job playing his character, but it makes the romance between him and Tris really uncomfortable. My favorite scene in the film is when Tris and the rest of the new members of Dauntless are heading back from playing a capture the flag like war game. They each strap up to a high-speed full body zip line that goes rocketing through the empty city. I think this scene is visually appealing even though it is very short and has really no importance to the film. The CGI and landscape in this scene is just well done. Since I have not read this trilogy, I was a little let down with certain aspects of the film. In 'Divergent' the film, the whole movie is mainly Tris training in Dauntless and it feels like the plot takes far too long to develop. The last 15-20 minutes of the film is where the action and the conflict begin to happen and then the movie is over. I found out that this is how the first book is written as well, but as someone who has very little prior knowledge of the series, it seems a bit odd. The second thing that threw me off was that it seems as if quite a bit of the dialogue is taken directly from the book. This is something that fans of the book will love since the films stays so true to the novel. However, from my point of view, a lot of the dialogue does not translate very well to the screen and appears a bit cheesy and forced at times. Like I said, this is really only an issue for me since I have not read the series nor was I a fan prior to watching the film. Overall, I was entertained despite these points. I recommend this film for ages 12 to 18 or for anyone who has read the novel. The movie gets a bit violent during training scenes and towards the end but is nothing too bad and if you've read the books you know what to expect. Overall I give Divergent 4 out of 5 stars because it is entertaining and I'm already eager for the next installment in the series. Plus I and all my friends that saw the film have been quoting the movie non-stop and making 'Divergent' references in almost every conversation, so it clearly left its mark on us!

Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," An Absolute Blast! Mind Blowing Stunts and Gadgets!
","A roller coaster of non-stop excitement! Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) faces a new threat called the Syndicate, a network dedicated to establish a new world order via terrorist attacks. Ethan has another problem - his agency, IMF, is shut down. Now, his team consists of rogue agents with the most impossible mission yet.I'm just going to be frank, this is my first Mission Impossible film and Rogue Nation makes me want to see more. As a movie lover, I get excited when I'm introduced to new film franchises and boy was this an introduction. Having no history with the franchise, it did not damage my extreme enjoyment. The film itself is an absolute blast. When the credits rolled, I felt as if I'd just come off an amusement park ride. This film has incredible car chases, mind blowing stunts and gadgets that even James Bond would beg for. Every scene is better than the last.Action is not the only thing that fuels this movie. It also has tremendous actors. Some of the feats pulled in this film are absurd and stretch your belief system. Performers like Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg successfully help you buy into these impossible situations. Even the characters they play are aware of the insanity but they treat it like an everyday occurrence because it's their job. Like magicians, there is a charm and elegance from the performer, so you don't catch the strings and mirrors. Even if you haven't seen other Mission Impossible films, I bet you recognize the iconic music. Many films and TV Shows have satirized it and who can blame them? The theme is grand! Many composers have added their own touch to it like Danny Elfman and even Hans Zimmer. This film's track is composed by Joe Kraemer and is one of the best versions, if not the best. The music starts out with two notes and then grows. As the music got louder, my pulse rose until the title came up and the Mission Impossible theme burst through the speakers. The music really gets you into the mood. My favorite character is Benji (Simon Pegg). I love the characters that have the gadgets and technology to help our hero. Benji is not only a loyal friend to Ethan, but their history makes the interactions between them funnier and sincere. My favorite scene is when Cruise is under water switching the security codes. When you hear about actors doing their own stunts, one man comes to mind - Tom Cruise. Cruise is known for his authenticity with stunts. (That's really him hanging on to the outside of the plane - with safety precautions of course) You'd think he's at his limit. Well, according to the director (Christopher McQuarrie), in this scene Cruise held his breath for six minutes. I looked it up! Even McQuarrie thought it was, 'too real.' While you're watching the scene, you're holding your breath as well. The moral of the story is, 'Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer.' Ethan has teamed up with Lisa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), an agent who may or may not be part of the Syndicate. Ethan is unsure if he can trust her, but he knows if he stays with her, the closer he is to stopping the Syndicate.I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to ages 10 through 18. There is, of course, violence and language but nothing you wouldn't expect in a PG-13 film. Your mission is to see Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. It is in theaters July 31.Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, go to kidsfirst dot org.",Null,1,3,29 July 2015
Dunkirk," A Visual Masterpiece with a Timely Topic about British Pride
","Dunkirk offers the most intense, beach set cinematic experience since the iconic film Jaws. In this new adaptation of such a strong battle, Christopher Nolan's talent as director and writer shines through, creating a visual masterpiece that leaves you mesmerized.The battle of Dunkirk was a short one, May 26 to June 4, 1940. Despite its minimal timeframe, it was deadly. WWII Allied soldiers were hiding, surrounded on all sides by the German Army and had to be evacuated on the beaches of Dunkirk, by way of an operation famously known as Operation Dynamo. On the ground, British Army Privates Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) and Alex (Harry Styles) are two of the men desperately fighting and struggling to remain alive and safely evacuate the beach, by whatever means available. Across the ocean, local sailors Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) and his son Peter (Toms Carney) had been recruited by the Navy to help with the evacuation. From yet another perspective, members of the Royal Air Force including Farrier (Tom Hardy) attempt to shoot down the German bombers, in order to help the stranded troops evacuate the beach and ocean safely.Let's talk about the production of the film. The cinematography, as expected from talented director and writer Christopher Nolan, is groundbreaking. Congratulations to Hoyte van Hoyterman for creating a visual masterpiece. Everything looks incredibly realistic and breathtaking, keeping you on your toes throughout the film. The scene that is the most memorable to me, is when one of the Air Force pilots soar through the sunset sky as the troops cheer in victory. I assure you that it will give you goosebumps and make you teary-eyed.The sound effects and the music by Hans Zimmer make the movie that much more tangible. The bombing begins from the very start of the film, preparing you for an emotional roller-coaster. They are so loud that it sounds as if they're coming from the back of the theater. If you listen closely, there's a ticking clock throughout the entire film, (minus the ending, which I will keep under wraps for you to discover) hidden within each song, creating increased tension and suspense. By the end of the film, I was already down to the nub of my fingertips, so prepare to be antsy!Harry Styles' performance is quite impressive, particularly since he is a known as a singer, not an actor. It is refreshing to see his excellent performance her, as he is the one with the most lines and delivers them eloquently, equal to an experienced actor. Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy also delivered remarkable performances. Dunkirk relies heavily on emotions since it barely has any dialogue, so it is important to have the story delivered by the visuals and the acting, which they achieved flawlessly.Dunkirk is rated PG-13 for intense war experiences and some language. Because of the stunning cinematography and story line, I rate Dunkirk 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. Go check it out, whether you are a history buff or not, this film will remind you how history affects us.Reviewed by Michelle C., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10,15,31,23 July 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," 'Spider-Man' on the Red Carpet and the Silver Screen
","Marvel Comics' heroes transfer well to the silver screen, but those who think they know Spider-Man from previous incarnations will meet a different Spider-Man/Peter Parker in Columbia Pictures' current release The Amazing Spider-Man. 'Â… it is a completely different film that starts at the beginning of Spider-Man's journey,' says KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Raven Devanney, age 15, in her review (below). Well, maybe not completely different, as the familiar events set the story in motion. But it is a new villain and a new love interest. And there is plenty of humor. 'In fact, this whole film is filled with comedy and action,' says Raven.KIDS FIRST! youth film critics were also there at the exciting red carpet event on Saturday. Be sure to check out the KIDS FIRST! website to share their experience on video.The Amazing Spider-Man Reviewed by Raven Devanney (See her full review on video.) http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=wqKg50yEwUMThe Amazing Spider-Man starring Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone definitely lives up to its title because it is truly amazing. I was expecting this film to be an add-on to the most recent Spider-Man series, but it is a completely different film that starts at the beginning of Spider-Man's journey. Of course, Peter Parker (played by Andrew Garfield) is bitten by a genetically modified spider and transforms into Spider-Man, his uncle Ben dies, and that's all the same in the past films about this spandex-sporting hero, but instead of falling for his typical love interest, MJ, Peter falls for Gwen Stacy (played by Emma Stone). And there is no Green Goblin in this film, but instead a new villain for Spider-Man to face.I love this movie! The special effects are phenomenal, especially in 3- D. I love Andrew Garfield in the part of Peter Parker because he does a fantastic job portraying him and he and Emma Stone have such great chemistry, which really shows in their characters. My favorite scene is when Peter is transforming into Spider-Man, because his aunt and uncle have no idea what's wrong with him and it's so funny. In fact, this whole film is filled with comedy and action. My favorite character would have to be Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone because I really admire her and she does a wonderful job playing this role.I think something very different about this film is it seems that the target audience is just teens, whereas in past Spider-Man movies the main audience is teens and adults. Overall, I give The Amazing Spider- Man 5 out of 5 stars because it is amazing and I want to see it over and over again. I can't wait for the sequel to come out. Go catch it in a theater near you!Catch Anthony Aranda's (age 10) review of The Amazing Spider-man here: http://www.youtube.com/my_videos?sq=spider-man.",10,6,14,29 October 2012
The Lego Movie," Heroes Come in Odd Packages
","This is a fast pace action, comedy, that shows that Lego's are more than just plastic bricks. The story is about Emmet (Chris Pratt) who is just an ordinary guy that always follows the instructions. However, once he finds a magical relic, he is now known as the special person who is supposed to defeat Lord Business (Will Ferrell) from launching an evil plan. So with the help of Wildstyle (Elizabeth Banks), Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), and more hilarious characters, he sets out to save the world.I love this movie! It has a 'Toy Story' atmosphere to it that makes it entertaining. The writers don't try to hide the fact that the Lego people are plastic figures, they just write it in the way that Lego figures would move and act. Even the characters sort of know what they are, although they don't know everything. The jokes are always thrown at you and all of them get a laugh. It has a parody element to it that is surprisingly funny for kids and adults. When a company that has been around for generations and has so much merchandise, you can't help but admire the creators for making fun of their toy. It does is heart- warming how creativity is important. The animation is marvelous - the way the characters build structures, vehicles and double-decker couches is an experience to see. Just watching this imaginative universe makes me wonder, 'What can't you make out of Legos'?!My favorite character is hard to pick out of dozens of lovable characters. I would have to choose Good Cop / Bad Cop (Liam Neeson). I love this character's double personality and he cracks me up every time I see him.My favorite scene is when Emmet talks to Lord Business about how you don't how to follow the instructions all the time. This scene shows and proves how Legos are important to people. How the simplicity of building a spaceship or anything, can spark inspiration for kids and adults to build. The moral of the story is that everyone is special. Emmet does not think he has the mind or experience to fulfill his prophecy. He soon learns that if you believe in yourself you can do extraordinarily things.I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to 5 to18-year-olds. This film reminds us on how Legos can change our lives. We all had Legos once in our lives, whether you follow the instructions, build or just played with them, it does not matter. Legos have been around for generations and these bricks have shown us new worlds to explore and enjoy. This film is timeless and I hope it will be know for a long time.Reviewed by Keefer B. KIDS FIRST Film CriticThis movie is something special. This movie will make kids' dreams come true everywhere. What movie I'm talking about? Well it's 'The Lego Movie' of course. This great film has comedy, adventure, suspense, music, romance, LEGOS and a great story line. The story is about an unlikely hero, who turns out to be part of a big prophesy and a lot of exciting battles and adventures. But, is this just all a part of a kid's imagination or do Legos truly come to life when we are not looking? I love so many things about this movie! A very unique part is the animation. It's plastic, smooth and looks a lot like real Lego pieces. At parts it feels like its stop motion but it's not. Most of the sets where were made out of hundreds of Legos. Imagine it, five adults playing with a whole bunch of Legos for work. I am sure most kids would wish to be a part of such production. If you add to the mix the voice- overs by amazing actors such as Morgan Freeman, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett and Will Ferrell â€“ you get an animated film that will captivate your heart for sure.I have a couple of favorite scenes. First, when Batman, Emmet, Wyldstyle, the Wizard and Benny are all stuck in the ocean on a 'double decker couch.' Batman says 'It's not like a gigantic ship will show up' and right when he says that, a ship comes out of nowhere. Then later, when they need a part and he says 'It's not like there's a spaceship or anything' and what do you know, the Millennium Falcon drops by! I recommend this movie to ages 2 to 17. Older people may not enjoy the humor as much as younger kids. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Gerry O, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Now You See Me," Unique, Keeps You on the Edge of Your Seat with All its Twists and Turns
","I absolutely love this film. 'Now You See Me' is like nothing I've ever seen before. 'Now You See Me' tells the story of a group of magicians called The Four Horsemen who use their skills to pull off some of the greatest international robberies of their generation. Featuring Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKenny (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), the Four Horsemen make a dream team of street magicians. Since they have made their stunts public, allowing the world to 'witness' the robberies, authorities are in hot pursuit of the four, now wanted criminals. Detective Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is accompanied in his search for the illusive magicians by Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) and French detective Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). Will the Four Horsemen be able to pull of their final act without being caught, or will it be curtains for the criminal performers?The plot is so original and full of fresh ideas and witty comedy. I love how fast paced this film is, I swear there isn't a dull moment from beginning to end. The plot itself has so many twists and turns it should be a pretzel, but it keeps the audience guessing the whole time and hits you with major shock factor. The acting in this film is incredible. It features a group of incredible actors - Morgan Freeman, Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Woody Harrelson and many others. I love how each character has a unique quirk and personality that you can really see, but they all work together so well. The cinematography and special effects in this film are phenomenal. It is bursting with rich colors and textures, drawing you into the magic and making the illusions appear so real. The soundtrack is also amazing. It is suits each scene very well, while keeping a consistent theme and feel throughout the movie. 'Now You See Me' is definitely not one to miss.It's hard for me to pick a favorite character because I love all of the Horsemen, but when it comes down to it I have to say I like the characters Daniel Atlas and Jack Wilder. Daniel, played by Jesse Eisenberg, often tries to assert himself as the head of the Four Horsemen. He is controlling, very specific and difficult to deal with, but he is also the funniest character which is attributed to all of his demanding qualities. I love every film Jesse Eisenberg is in and I think he is perfect for the role of Daniel Atlas. I also like Jack Wilder, played by Dave Franco, because he is the craftiest of the magicians. He isn't the 'card trick' or 'read your mind' type, he's just a good old fashioned pick-pocket for whom no door is ever locked.. He is sort of the 'muscle' to the operation because he is able to help the horsemen get out of tight situations and he is also very funny.My favorite scene is when the Four Horsemen have to escape from the FBI after their second robbery. Jack Wilder has to stay behind to burn secret files. When he has an unexpected run-in with Detective Rhodes, an action filled fight sequence and high speed chase follow. This scene is filled with suspense, action and incredible stunts and it shows that the Horsemen are always two steps ahead.I recommend this film for ages 12+ because of violence and mild mature language. Overall I give 'Now You See Me' 5 out of 5 stars. See Raven's video review on kidsfirst.org",10,111,212,3 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Probably the Best X-Men Film Yet
","X-traordinarily perfect! I've been waiting for this movie for a while and what a payoff.The future, as we know it, is a wasteland for mutants: hunted and eliminated by the Sentinels. To stop this from ever happening, Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is sent into the past to prevent this dark outcome. I adore the X-Men series and to see it again is beyond fantastic. Bringing back the original iconic actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto) makes me overjoyed! Even the younger versions of them - Micheal Fassbender and James McAvory are their own 3-dimensional characters because they're not trying to be replicas of their older selves. Their interaction and relationships are strong and, just as in 'X-Men First Class,' I love seeing Eric and Xavier just talking. These two started as friends and the film shows that perfectly. They have different pathways and ways to fix events but they never give up on each other. The action and special effects in this film are grand. Showing different mutant powers is what made X-Men unique to begin with. It's not entirely combat action, like 'Avengers,' it's more letting their powers do the work. Magneto slowly lifts an entire baseball stadium, which allows us to marvel at how powerful mutants can be.The story is astounding! This film has to pick-up from the previous films and tie-up loose ends. Not only do they succeed but, they also remember little details. Example: the young Wolverine doesn't have metal claws. They're bone because he doesn't get the metal ones until sometime in the future. Specifics like that add to how incredible this film is. It can also confuse people who haven't seen the other films. There are inside jokes and character connections that could be lost. My favorite character is Quicksilver (Evan Peters), a mutant who has incredible speed. This is by far the best representation of a comic-book character. Evan shows the mischievous and cocky side of Silver that is always a kick to watch.My favorite scene is Quicksilver's super speed sequence. This is when the team breaks Eric/Magneto out of a Pentagon prison and the group is cornered by security. Quicksilver, without a care in the world, pranks the guards by poking the bullets in mid-air, pulling their guns out of their hands and more. This is such an incredible ride that it just needs to be experienced.The message of this film is, 'Choices you make in the present, affect your future.' The whole reason for this story is that one careless act has changed the world forever. We need to think through the choices we make to have a bright future. I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 13- to 18 year-olds. This film shows dark images and language that is not intended for younger audiences. Keefer B., KIDSFIRST!

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Very Creative and Enjoyable
","I enjoyed this movie very much and thought it was very creative. The movie starts just like other Harry Potter movies. It shows a fight and you see a bit of the evil wizard, Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) and then it switches to multiple newspapers that say he is loose and discusses multiple other topics that will appear in the movie. First, you should know there is no Hogwarts or anything like it. There is only New York City. Something new that I noticed that I did not know before is that the Harry Potter films had mostly British actors and took place in England. This film takes place in New York and they call a non-magic person a No-Maj (American for Muggle). This film takes place in 1926 and the protagonist, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) says he is a writer and is going to write the book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. This is a real book with his name on it and you may see on one book cover that it says 'Property of Harry Potter,' which is pretty cool. Another thing that is fantastic about this film is, of course, the beasts! The creatures look like they could actually be real. I do not know how they created them exactly, animation or special effects, but they look amazing. However they did it, is great! Another cool thing is the creativity put into the creatures. There are many creatures and each magical beast is different and has unique features and abilities. Some parts are loud and scary, especially if you are in a theater. I can handle a fair amount of scary things in movies, but even I flinched at certain intense parts. The most amazing part of this film is the acting. Sometimes, I am not convinced that actors are trying to make a movie seem real. Not in this film. There is no part where the actors are not doing his or her very best acting. One actor I saw that acted his part clearly and fits right into his role is Dan Fogler, who plays Jacob Kowalski. This person is a No-Maj or Muggle that runs into Newt. You might imagine that this person would need to be confused, amazed or scared and, when he had to, he was. He acts as if he is actually Jacob and he really gets pulled into a fantastical world of magic and creatures. By the end of the film you just can't help but like the guy, even though he has no magical powers or even anything very interesting about him. He's just an ordinary No-Maj. .I believe this film is suitable for ages 9 to18. There are multiple scenes that might be too scary for younger kids. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars for its fantastic acting, creativity and special effects. It also has some very sweet parts.",10,0,2,18 November 2016
Inside Out," We've Got a Masterpiece on Our Hands!
","Ladies and gentlemen, we have a masterpiece on our hands. Pixar has done it again. They already lay claim to two of the top 100 movies of all-time with Up and Wall-E and they have now added Inside Out to their mantelpiece. I will gladly go on record by calling this one of the finest animated features to ever be created. Why? Because it's THE most innovative, imaginative and creative film to be made since 2008s Synecdoche, New York.The beautiful thing about this movie is that both adults and children can enjoy it. As a matter of fact, I'd say that adults may enjoy it more, because they can have a more fundamental understanding of what this film is. It is 100 minutes of analogous brilliance, that changes our idea of what goes on in our heads. Is this idea fathomable or true? No. But the analogy provides the very product film was invented to produce: a stimulation of the imagination. Children will enjoy the beautiful colors and the basic plot. What the children can understand is what they can relate to: growing up and adjusting to life as they enter puberty. They will laugh at things that SEEM funny or the more, for lack of better word, simple pieces of humor. But the true jokes, the pieces of humor that have the most intellect are the ones children won't understand. I appreciate those the most because they're fathomable. It's the moment when you laugh, not because the joke is ridiculous, but because you can actually imagine that happening.Amidst the hilarity there is also a certain depth of emotion. There is a tear-jerking moment, yes, but I mean more along the lines of nostalgia. The way the movie portrays the effects of the emotions and the rationalization that go along with them, conjure a desire to reflect on oneself in their pre-teen days. This film may literally get into the mind of a pre-teen, but the metaphorical representation is what seals the reflection. 'I was like that?', 'Is that how I thought then...I that how I think now?' may be questions you find yourself asking yourself. These are the effects of a brilliant screenplay.On a final and personal note, I'll tell this short story. There is a scene in the film, where two officers are questioning a cloud in Imagination Land about her dead husband. Then, in the middle of the interrogation the cloud herself is killed as she is run through by our main character. One cop goes, 'Hey wait...', but as he says that, the other cop grabs him and says, 'Forget it Jake, it's Cloud Town.' Get it? It's a parody of the famous final words from the classic 1974 noir, Chinatown. I'll tell you, it wasn't very comfortable being the only person in the theater laughing at that joke. It's just one joke amongst many. Beyond the hilarity and, mainly due to the aforementioned reasons I explained, I happily give this instant classic 5 out of 5 stars. I recommend it for ages 7 to 18.This film will be released on DVD/Blu-ray/Digital on November 3 and its bonus features are very informative and engaging. They give wonderful insights to the making of the movie. The feature, Story of the Story really tells you how much thinking went into this story. Mixed Emotions and Mapping the Mind go hand in hand as they provide both characterizations of the emotions and scientific findings pertaining to our emotions. There are also great features about the underrated parts of making this movie, like how the score was created and what the editing was like. My favorite of all of them, is the short film Lava which has become one of my favorite short films.Reviewed by Willie J., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 16.",10,11,42,4 November 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," True to the Book!
","'The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug' is the second installment of the three part series adapted from the best selling novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. A prequel to the epic trilogy 'Lord of the Rings,' 'The Hobbit' follows young Bilbo Baggins, played by Martin Freeman, as he accompanies Gandalf and the Dwarfs on a quest to rid their home of the evil dragon Smaug. In 'The Desolation of Smaug,' the Dwarfs, Bilbo and Gandalf find themselves not only having to face the evil dragon that destroyed the Dwarf Kingdom, but they also have to deal with the threat of the Orcs, the Elves and the Necromancer. Thorin, the exiled Dwarf King is desperately trying to free his people of the dreaded Smaug, but greed begins to overtake him when he starts to focus his attention on a precious stone that is being guarded by the dragon. Will the Dwarfs and Bilbo be triumphant in their epic quest, or will they awaken a power greater and more evil than they could have ever imagined.I really enjoyed this movie. I wasn't very impressed by the first Hobbit film that was released in 2012, but 'Desolation of Smaug' is incredible. The stunning 3D visuals really bring the work of Tolkien to life and, I think the darkness of this film fits a lot better with the 'Lord of the Rings' series than the first film did. I really like the fact that they are making three movies off of the one book because I think if they tried to cram everything into one movie it would be way too much. I love the soundtrack in this film. The film has some really beautiful visuals and they are capture the original feel of the Tolkien series while also throwing in some really fun and upbeat tunes.My favorite character is Bilbo Baggins because I absolutely adore Martin Freeman. He is such a versatile actor and can play very serious roles while also bringing in playful and comedic qualities. Martin also plays Watson in the BBC series 'Sherlock' which is one of my favorite TV shows and I just love everything he's in. He really embodies the character Bilbo and it's very interesting to see the way Bilbo changes from the last film. His character development is great and Martin Freeman does a phenomenal job taking on that role.My favorite scene is when Bilbo encounters Smaug for the first time. The exchange between the two characters is very interesting because Smaug seems very curious about Bilbo and doesn't immediately attack like you expect and Bilbo does everything he can to distract Smaug by complimenting him and talking circles around him. The whole scene has a lot of suspense but it's also very playful. I also love the look of Smaug and the CGI for him is incredible. They capture his features in such a wonderful way. You can really tell what he's feeling by the faces he makes and the very human expressions he has.I recommend this film for ages 13+ because there is a lot of action, violence and suspenseful situations. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and it is definitely a must see if you are a fan of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

The Fault in Our Stars," A Summer Love Story Unlike Most
","Never have I seen a movie so heart wrenching as this one. The Fault In Our Stars is an exceptional movie that will have you crying, laughing and anxious all at the same time. It is based on the amazing novel written by John Green. In this movie, Shailene Woodley plays Hazel Grace, a girl diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Ansel Elgort plays Gus Waters who is diagnosed with cancer as well. They fell in love with each other the way we fall asleep, slowly and then all at once. Their journey goes from meeting their favorite author in Amsterdam to rushing to the hospital for immediate chemotherapy. This movie shows the hardships of being in love and fighting for your life in such a beautiful but realistic manner. I absolutely love this film.There are so many great aspects about this movie that it's hard to highlight a few. However, one of my favorite things is the whole plot and its meaning. It creatively captures a teenager's perspective of love but also of dealing with cancer. It reaches out to a younger audience but still allows an older audience to enjoy it. John Green knows how to grab the audience's attention by intertwining the two most heart- wrenching aspects of life - love and death. Another thing I really love about the movie is how well it depicts the book it is based on. I read the book a few months ago and I loved how the director put in just enough of the details to keep its authenticity. I didn't feel like there was anything missing. Overall, this movie is extremely great and I want everyone to enjoy it as I did.My favorite character is Hazel Grace Lancaster. Hazel is witty and smart but also strong and understands things. She teaches Gus a lot about books and how not to be afraid of oblivion. Hazel knows she's going to die but she accepts that and she wants her parents to accept that too. I think a lot of teens going through love or even pain can relate to Hazel Grace. My favorite scene is when Hazel, Gus and Isaac go to Isaac's ex- girlfriend's house. Isaac's ex-girlfriend, Monica, dumped Isaac because he was going to have eye surgery which would leave him blind. Right before the surgery, Monica dumped Isaac and never even asked if he was okay. Hazel, Gus and Isaac want revenge so they go to egg her house. This part is so funny because Isaac is blind and he can't see where he's throwing the eggs. This struck me as so funny because he's throwing the eggs in the bushes and at the trees but Hazel and Gus try to keep his spirit up by giving him encouragement. It is just a funny scene. I recommend this movie for ages 12 to 18 because it is a lot to comprehend and some of the information about death may be too much for young children. I am 14 and have never cried so much in two hours. This is an amazing movie and I give it 5 out of 5 stars. This is a great movie for teens to go out and watch with friends. It comes out this weekend so make sure you get to watch this movie, you won't regret it!Reviewed by Jailene A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," If You Love Lord of the Rings, You'll Love The Hobbit!
","I thought this movie was OK, but I only think that's because I watched the Lord of the Rings when I was 5 and can hardly remember anything about it at all. Plus fantasy films aren't my thing. However my mother who happens to be a huge Lord of the Rings fan loved the movie.I do have to give the movie props for the cinematography. I mean, oh my God, the visuals are beautiful!! All of the images are so clear and crisp, I literally felt like I was right there with Bilbo. I especially love the Elf kingdom and the graphics for that are amazing. I can't even explain with words how beautiful the imagery and 3D are in this film, you just have to see it for yourself. There are a few things that bothered me about the visuals though. Some of it is almost too perfect and too clear. You can see every piece of grass in the field and every pore or drop of sweat on the Dwarfs. It is a bit too much. The other thing that pulled me away from the movie is how the Orcs look. They look like video game characters and they don't have the same quality of the rest of the CGI in the film.My favorite character in The Hobbit is, by far, Gollum. Even though he is only in one scene of this movie, he is really funny in a creepy way. I really want to go back and re-watch the Lord of the Rings just to see more of him! I also like Bilbo Baggins because everyone doubts him, but he never gives up or turns back. My favorite scene is a toss up between when Bilbo meets Gollum and when the Dwarfs are in the underground world of the Goblins. I love when Bilbo meets Gollum because the two of them have a very funny interaction of riddling each other. I also like when the Dwarfs are escaping the Goblins because their world is underground and very rickety.I think the biggest downside of this movie is the length. It is way too long in my opinion, but then again, all of the Lord of the Rings films have been very long as well. If you enjoy the Lord of the Rings then you will love The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, but will I see it again? No. So, I will say the cinematography deserves 5 out of 5 stars but, the overall film only gets 3.5 out of 5 from me.Reviewed by Raven Devanney, age 15, KIDS FIRST!

Non-Stop," Intense, Spine-Tingling Film that Keeps You on the Edge of Your Seat Throughout
","This is a suspenseful film that keeps you guessing until the end and it had me biting my nails from the beginning. This plot starts with an air marshal named Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) who is on a plane from New York to London. On the flight he receives a disturbing text that tells him, 'I'll kill someone every 20 minutes' if Bill doesn't do what the person says. While trying everything to find the person who's sending him these messages, the passengers, crew and his boss start to think he's hijacking the plane. Even Bill starts to question himself. So with no one to trust and everyone against him, he must try to stop this anonymous character in this crowded plane. With a plot like this, how can you not be somewhat interested? The movie keeps your attention and you really want to know what's going to happen. This movie's atmosphere is uncomfortable, which it's supposed to be. The wide angle lens is appropriate and makes the confined space even more real. The script is terrific! It's a perfect example of a movie where, once you watch it, you want to watch it again. All the pieces of the puzzle come together. There are reasons and evidence that lead you to the outcome without giving it away. That's a sign of a great mystery. The acting in this film is fantastic and all the actors like Julianne Moore as Jen Summers, who had to act in these claustrophobic sets, do an impressive job portraying their roles. I enjoy Liam Neeson and fully appreciate his acting skills in this film. He shows why he continues to be a top rated star. My favorite scene is when Bill thinks he's found and stopped the terrorist. For a moment Bill is relieved it's over. Then he hears his phone bing an incoming text and the music gets your heart racing. The moral is, 'Honesty is the best policy.' The passengers and crew are against him because Bill's hiding the truth. As humans we automatically think the worse if we have to piece a situation together. Bill finally realizes that.I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to 12 to 18-year-olds. There is smoking and intense moments that are not intended for kids. This is a investing and spine tingling film that is worth checking out. Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST Film Critic For more reviews, go to kidsfirst dot org.",Null,2,9,28 February 2014

Avengers: Infinity War," Mind-bending! Wow! Just Wow!
","Wow! Just, wow!! Marvel Cinematic Universe has been building up to this movie for ten years. This movie is glorious. All I can say is, you will not be expecting what happens. It left me screaming inside. I still cannot believe it.The storyline is about the Avengers and their allies needing to team up to stop the titan Thanos from collecting The Infinity Stones and destroying half the universe. Now, because all the Marvel characters are finally coming together, Marvel fans will obviously be excited. And when basically every single character appears on-screen, the theater erupts into claps and screams of joy. I always love it when a studio or company can make people feel such excitement for their characters. It's just really cool. This movie features lots of different locations that the characters travel to. I must admit, some of these locations are absolutely gorgeous and others, totally desolate, but still incredible. I love the shots in space and on different planets, especially the snowy planet that Thanos goes to at one point. In fact, the whole movie looks fantastic. Everything - from the costumes, the camera angles, the scale, the special effects - everything! I was so invested in the visuals the entire time. Also, let's be honest, this is Marvel, we all expect this movie to be absolutely hilarious. And it is. No surprises there. I laughed so hard at Iron Man and Doctor Strange arguing, Star Lord being jealous of Thor and basically all of Spider Man and Drax's dialogue. Comedy always seems to be Marvel's greatest strength. The writing, in general, is fantastic. I love the interactions these characters have, even the dramatic moments. That's coming from someone who usually hates dramatic moments, because I hate being sad in movies. This is a superhero movie, so obviously there are some pretty cool action scenes. And yeah, this movie has some awesome action scenes. Probably my favorite is the huge fight in Wakanda that is shown in the trailer. The fight is absolutely massive and straight up amazing. The shots and the way the characters work together are just glorious. I felt so immersed in all the action.Since this movie is connected to the other Marvel movies in their Cinematic Universe, there is the possible question about whether you need to have seen all the other movies in order to understand this one. I would say, not all of them, but at least a few certain ones. I recommend that you brush up on your Marvel characters before you go, just to be ready.I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, as it gets pretty dark.

Watch his online review http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tAfW1zpITs, his interview with John Lasseter http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nee0jYNvTg and the Cars 2 crew or read below to see what KIDS FIRST! film critic Anthony Aranda, age 9 has to say:I just got finished watching an amazing movie called 'Cars 2'! Race car Lightning McQueen and his best friend Mater travel to compete in the World Grand Prix. Cars 2 brings back our favorite car friends in this excellent adventure movie!My favorite characters are Lightning McQueen, Mater, and Finn McMissile. I like Lightning McQueen because he is really fast and he is really friendly. I like Mater because he is a really funny character and he doesn't always know what's going on. But even if he doesn't know what's going on he is always the best friend McQueen could ever have. I like Finn McMissle because he is a great spy car and he helps Mater to see who he really is. Mater realizes that he is perfect just the way he is.My favorite part of this movie is when Mater is being a spy and gets into a fire fight with the bad cars, but not on purpose! He says, 'Dag Gum,' and then a gun pops out of his truck. Then he said, 'Oh shoot,' and then the gun starts shooting! And then he said, 'Not that kind of shoot,' and then a parachute popped out of his truck and he started to fly away. It was sooo funny!The animation and special effects in this movie are really cool. The bright lights and colors in the cars is amazing. The opening scene where Crabby is coming through the ocean is really cool. They had to use a lot of computer graphics in order to make the water actually look like it is waves. And of course the explosions are super cool.I would recommend this movie for ages three and up. This movie does have some violence but it isn't really scary or noticeable to younger kids. All in all, this is a great family movie that shows friendship and teamwork. Go out and buy this movie when it comes out on Disney DVD and Blu Ray.Credit: Anthony Aranda, age 9, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic",9,0,1,7 July 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," The most other-worldly visual effects of any recent movie.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is the fifth installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and has the most other-worldly visual effects of any recent movie. The CGI is the most mesmerizing piece of treasure throughout the film. Johnny Depp again stars as Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa. It also stars the terrific Javier Bardem as the new villain, Captain Salazar. Brenton Thwaites plays Henry Turner and Kaya Scodelario plays Carina Smyth. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have cameos as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, respectively. Full disclosure: I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and I have loved the Pirates of the Caribbean movies since I was 5 years old!At the beginning of the film, Captain Jack Sparrow is presumed dead. He resurfaces in a most humorous way. Captain Salazar is Jack Sparrow's oldest nemesis. He takes revenge on Sparrow by unleashing the vicious ghost pirates of Devil's Triangle. The ghost pirates are hell-bent on killing Sparrow and destroy multiple pirate ships in the process. The only way to break the curse is to find and destroy the Trident of Poseidon. Along the way, we learn the background of Will Turner's son, Henry Turner. He's looking for Sparrow and also trying to find the Trident in order to save his father who is trapped in Davy Jones Locker. Carina Smyth is a young astronomer who is also searching for the Trident. What ensues is a humorous, action packed adventure on the high seas.The special effects and CGI are astoundingly lifelike. The most stunning visual effects in the film are the CGI animated ghost sharks, which are sent to hunt down Jack Sparrow. The movements of the ghost pirates and sharks are hyper-realistic. Out of all the Pirates of The Caribbean films, this one utilizes the most mythological elements. Johnny Depp again aces his performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. His interpretation of Jack Sparrow is one of the most entertaining and memorable characters in recent film history. The inimitable Geoffrey Rush is again terrific as Captain Barbossa and Javier Bardem, an acclaimed actor from art house and independent films, is riveting as the vicious Captain Salazar.One flaw of the film is how Keira Knightley suddenly appears for one minute during the movie. It's the one false note because it seems gratuitous. However, it doesn't distract from the impact and excitement of the film. Compared to other movie sequels, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales flows surprisingly well and moves along at an exciting pace. The film is appropriate for 10 to18 year olds. I give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales 5 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Clayton P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10,12,31,23 May 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Great for Fans, Great for Non-Fans - Special Effects Are Show Stoppers!
","Groundbreaking effects, huge actions scenes and memorable characters and actors! Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man / Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is back on the big screen in this gripping story about a boy who has the powers of a spider. He's up against Electro / Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), a man seeking attention, Harry Osborn / Green Goblin (Dane DaHaan), Peter's best friend and Spider-Man's foe, while still having to keep a promise and not uncover his parents' secret. In this film, the writers allocate more time to show the alter-ego of Peter Parker without making it run too long or lose the action. The strong relationship between all the characters, whether it's love or hatred is all 3-Dimensional. It helps when you have capable actors filling these roles. The story creates a darker look at being a hero and throws in some comic book jokes once in a while. This movie had a chance of becoming too unfocused. It has two villains to establish, the romance between Peter and Gwen, Peter trying to figure out the truth about his parents' past and more. However, with the help of a very talented director, Marc Webb and wonderful writers, Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Jeff Pinkner, they pick a goal for the plot and follow through with it, while bringing all the actors' story arcs together naturally. The special effects in this film are beyond amazing! Electro's design makes him the most unique villain. The special effect's department really gets creative on how Spider-Man moves and fights, especially when he's in spider-sense mode and everything slows down. I gained a new respect for Jamie Foxx who portrays my favorite character Electro / Max Dillon. He plays a menacing villain, but also shows the tragic and even pathetic side of Max Dillon. On the Google+ Hangout which I was fortunate to be part of, Jamie confided that he 'based this character on a person he knew.' Behind all the CGI you see Jamie honor this person. The battle in Times Square between Electro and Spider-Man in my favorite scene. It encompasses all the incredible CGI effects mentioned. It's where Max finally gets attention, once he gets his powers and he sees himself on T.V. When Electro says, 'You see me?' You genuinely feel sorry for him. The moral of this story is, 'It doesn't matter how hard you fall, it matters how fast you get back up.' Peter goes through a life changing event and can't move on. However, in a clever and Marvel way, Aunt May gives Peter some advice that changes things.I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 10- to 18-year-olds. There are violent and intense scenes that some kids may not be able to handle, but this is a marvelous adaptation of Spider-Man.

Hidden Figures," What an Inspiration!
","This absolutely fantastic film will inspire so many people to never give up on their dreams and talents. It shows that you can do anything if you put your mind to it.The movie takes place in the 1960s where sexism and racial discrimination is still at a high. There is fear of the Soviet Union since they already have the technology to send astronauts into space, though there is still hope for America. This is a true story which revolves around three extremely intelligent African-American women - Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Mary Jackson (Janelle MonÃ¡e) and Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) who all work for the NASA program. They are the brains behind the launch of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell). The woman struggle with using their brilliance since they live in a world where the color of their skin defines who they are and who they are not going to be.The acting is fabulous! Taraji P. Henson is made to play Katherine Johnson. Taraji highlights the braveness and intelligence of her character, adding a bit of a quirky side as well. I feel that I know her character like a friend. Mary Jackson (Janelle MonÃ¡e) is my favorite character out of them all. She has this determination in her that is mind blowing. She can be very serious at times, but one of the most hilarious people at others. Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) definitely takes on the leader role. When watching this film you feel for her struggles and want her to succeed so badly. Octavia brings boldness and sarcasm that just makes you adore her. I felt the strong friendship between these woman.I could tell how much time was spent in designing the set and costumes. The sets are so realistic that I felt transformed into that time period. I loved looking at the small details added to each set. Renee Ehrlich Kalfus designed the costumes which are so colorful and suit each character perfectly. It is so interesting to see how different the clothes were back then. The costumes helped add to it being the 60s.My favorite scene is when Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) breaks down the colored woman's bathroom sign to show that everyone can share the same restroom. Al Harrison is the head of the NASA launch program. This is my favorite scene because I loved seeing someone who looked beyond the color of people's skin.The main message of this film is to never give up on your dreams, even when people tell you that you can't. The three woman look beyond their gender and their skin color. They look at the talents they have. One example of this is when Katherine Johnson is talking to Jim Johnson. Jim is surprised as to why they are having a woman do such important things at NASA. Katherine retorts with an inspiring line 'Yes they let women do some things at NASA Mister Johnson. And it's not because we wear skirts. It's because we wear glasses!' I recommend this film for ages 9 to 18. The younger audiences will enjoy learning about the past and be inspired to shoot for the stars. The older audiences will like the comedy and the amazing story. I give this film a 5 out of 5 astronaut stars.Reviewed by Talia J., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, go to kidsfirst dot org.",10,17,43,6 January 2017
Lincoln," 'Lincoln' a Tall Accomplishment
","KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Anthony Aranda, age 10, makes a valuable observation when he says, 'Â… the history is important to kids like me.' The movie Lincoln depicts the President during the Civil War, a pivotal time in United States history. 'Â… it's a really good movie to teach more about the Civil War,' Anthony says. He also feels the movie shows this President, who has become almost a mythological figure in many depictions, as a 'regular person.' Heavily researched, Lincoln's depiction of the man may provide a new perception amongst the older folks in the audience as well. Says KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Morgan Bertsch, age 8, 'I thank Steven Spielberg and DreamWorks for making this fabulous movie.'Reviewed by Anthony Aranda Video Review here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__EBxLluPQsLincoln is pretty good but it was made for an older audience. I usually don't watch too many movies that are this serious, but the history is important to kids like me. This movie is all about President Abraham Lincoln, and in the movie it's the middle of the Civil War so Lincoln is trying to make peace between the North and the South. He creates the Thirteenth Amendment so there will be peace in the country.The main characters in the movie are Abraham Lincoln, Lincoln's wife and Lincoln's son. My favorite character is, of course, Lincoln because he is a good guy but he needs to spend time with his family more. He is too distracted by the Thirteenth Amendment that he almost forgets about his family. He really loves his family, but he also really loves the citizens of the country.My favorite part in the movie is when Lincoln's son is riding in the White House with a goat and a carriage. Another funny part is when one of Lincoln's advisers walks in looking for the President and sees his son sitting, reading the paper like a grown up. There were some scary parts during the movie when the soldiers were fighting and getting hurt. This was a sad part for me, also, to watch.To me, the movie is more than just what we know from the history books. I think it shows me a little more about Abraham Lincoln as a regular person. And it's a really good movie to teach more about slavery and the Civil War, which is a really important part of our history.I would recommend this movie for ages 12 and up only because the movie was meant for an older audience and there is some pretty graphic stuff in there. But if you love history, this is a great movie for you. Go out and see this movie in theaters now.Reviewed by Morgan Bertsch Video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaRvzOuHk4I thank Steven Spielberg and DreamWorks for making this fabulous movie.

They really studied on their characters. And you will learn about the voting process.Also, they really studied their characters and they really took them very seriously, and really show a bunch of emotions with them. I think they do a great job.This is actually a time piece with an amazing all-star cast. And also, the costumes are fantastic!There's a little bit of language and also parts of violence, but the history lesson is everything that everyone should learn.

Big Hero 6," Adorable, Funny, Clever, Action-Packed Adventure
","The movie Big Hero 6 is adorable, funny, and downright enjoyable. The movie is about a young, intelligent, robotics fanatic named Hiro Hamada, voiced by Ryan Potter, who spends his days hustling adults in 'bot fights' until his brother, Tadashi, voiced by Daniel Henney, introduces him to his college and friends. Hiro then spends his days trying to get accepted into his brother's school to apply his knowledge of robotics to a greater cause. Hiro later develops a lovable bond between himself and an inflatable robot named Baymax, voiced by Scott Adsit. After Hiro encounters a dangerous force that threatens his future and safety of the city, he turns to Baymax and his friends to make a heroic group called 'Big Hero 6' to fight evil. The movie takes us through an action-packed adventure that provides laughter, tears, tension and relief. The unpredictable plot makes the movie very exciting and hilarious. The movie is funny within the first few minutes which is really delightful because it avoids a slow beginning. Even though this movie is about superheroes fighting evil with intense superhero gear, it does not follow the typical superhero expectations because the heroes handle situations differently than expected. The movie provides realism and surprisingly does not sugar coat certain scenarios. There a certain times where one would think 'wow, I'm surprised Disney did that' but that surprise is good because it makes the movie stand out from the rest in a new and different way. The characters are so lovable, especially Baymax, an adorable robot whose only purpose is to make others feel better. Because of this, it is easy for the audience to get attached to the characters and engage with the movie emotionally. The movie is phenomenal and appeals to adults as much as children which is a very special aspect. Not only does Big Hero 6 have clever dialogue, great special effects, lovable characters and nice music, but it also pays attention to little details and messages about education and friendship that contribute to an amazing movie as a whole. I will definitely watch this movie multiple times and recommend it ages 5 to 18. Be sure to check it out in theaters on November 7th.Reviewed by Harmony M., KIDS FIRST!

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Jedi - Just as Mind-Boggling As The Others!
","As I sat back in the comfy leather seats and watched the star-dusted opening credits roll out in front of me, I reminisced about what it felt like watching the Star Wars series for the first time. It has been a long time since that happened and my only hope was that Star Wars: The Last Jedi would be just as mind-boggling as the others. Shame on me for ever doubting the legendary billion-dollar franchise, because (spoiler alert): It is!If you haven't seen the previous installment, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, then I highly recommend you grab some friends to watch it with and get yourself back on track. Otherwise, you will be in for a big surprise. For those who have seen it, then you know that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) makes an iconic return to the big screen and this time, with a vengeance. Luke went into hiding, undetected, to the Porg-infested island of Ahch-To to die. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has a mission to bring Luke back to fight the Resistance as war is once again brewing against the First Order. Millions of porg-encounters later, Rey finally persuades Luke to lend her his knowledge in combat, leaving Luke unsettled by the strength of her powers.This time around, Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) leads the Resistance due to unforeseen circumstances. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Holdo go head to head as he refuses to follow Holdo's rules. This creates major conflict in the storyline, as some things don't necessarily go as planned during combat. We are also introduced to a new lead character, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a maintenance worker that guards the escape pods. She bonds with Finn (John Boyega) as she takes him to her wealthy home of Canto Bight. Though, there's so much more to this planet than meets the eye.Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) remains high and mighty, just for show. It's evident that he hides something deep within, something he cannot control - a slight hint of compassion. After a head-to-head conflict with Rey and Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), the film finally reveals who he truly is.
Now that you have an idea of what the film is about, let's talk about the magic that goes on behind-the-scenes. To be quite honest, the writing has its lows. There are moments when the audience would let out an uncomfortable laugh due to the awkward, juvenile jokes that we know certain characters would never say or do. It felt somewhat out-of-touch with the Star Wars franchise, especially since they are thrown in during the most serious, suspenseful scenes. Despite that, the rest of the screenplay is groundbreaking. It gives the audience what they want and what they didn't know they needed. Also, the cinematography is phenomenal. Shooting in locations such as Ireland and Croatia, the visual effects team make it seem as though they are off in a galaxy far, far away, without straying from its natural beauty. Special effects, as always, are mind-blowing. It's nearly impossible not to fathom light-sabers being real. Top it all off with detailed costume design and award-winning acting, and you've got yourself a masterpiece.Ultimately, Star Wars: The Last Jedi exceeded far beyond my expectations, and I urge you to go out with your Jedi Knight robes and light-sabers and experience it on the big screen. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 as well as adults. It opens December 15, 2017 in U.S. theaters so, go check it out. Reviewed by Michelle C., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Film Critic, Raven Devanney (age 15) shares her review below: video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNlM5zTqGHABrave is the all new Disney and Pixar animated film about a young princess who breaks tradition. Determined to change her fate, princess Merida attempts to use a spell to change her mother's opinions on marriage. But, as she soon learns, not everything is as it seems when it comes to magic. Brave is a visual masterpiece. It is honestly the best Disney Pixar film I have ever seen and it took my breath away. Which such beautiful imagery and an unsuspected storyline, I believe that Brave will go down in history as one of the best animations ever. I laughed and cried throughout the whole film, it even moved my parents to tears. The heavier emotions are so wonderfully crafted and the comedy is hilarious and very timely, it makes for a great emotional medley. My favorite character is princess Merida because she is so strong and determined even when she is faced with challenges and I believe that she is a character that every young person can look up tp. She is also determined to right her wrongs and fix her mistakes and that is something everyone should aspire to do. My favorite part of the film is watching the bear queen try to figure out how to get by in the wilderness because her facial expressions are still very human and hilarious. She was continuing to act like she was in a castle even though she was in the middle of the woods and it makes for a very comical situation. The end of the film is the best part for me. It blew me away and topped my every expectation for a movie ending, but you'll just have to see what happens for yourself. There is definitely some scary and intense parts in this film and younger kids may get frightened but I recommend this film for all ages because it's a must see for everyone. On a scale of 1-5 I give Brave 20 stars because it is so phenomenal so grab your family and friends.",10,6,13,3 August 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Predictable but Enjoyable
","It's predictable, clichÃ© and often times cartoonish...yet, Guardians of the Galaxy is still one of the most entertaining blockbusters you'll see this summer. Boasting beautiful special effects and constant humor, Guardians of the Galaxy may not be a groundbreaking entry into its genre, but it certainly is a welcome addition.The finest thing about this movie is the comedy that goes with it. Writer James Gunn really does a fine job of using the archetypal characters (tough female, dumb big guy, sassy little guy) and gives them attributes that add to their farce. Really, the comedy is the film's saving grace, as its predictability sucks away any suspense. Remember, with a film such as this, it's not where the path ends that matters, it's how much fun you have along the way. I give my utmost respect to Bradley Cooper for his sensational, and hilarious voice-over work. Between his prerecorded deliveries and the wonderful editing of Fred Raskin, Hughes Winborne and Craig Wood, the character of Rocket becomes an instant fan favorite. I also enjoyed his lovable sidekick, Groot who tells you his name a ton of times in the film in comedic fashion. If you're a film and acting nerd like me, I think you might find more excitement in seeing Glenn Close and Benicio Del Toro in their fine supporting roles. They don't do much but their presence alone is enough.I find it interesting that Groot, who has the least amount of lines, is the best-written character in the whole film. Groot says so much without saying anything and is easily the most lovable and the most human character in the film. Despite the fine characterization and portrayals of the 'good guys' in the film, the villains are terrible. They are probably the worst thing about the movie. They are overly cartoonish and come off as B-movie caricatures. From the overly dramatic, yet beautiful, score accompanying the villains, to their hammy portrayals, they are just hard to watch. It's funny how films of this nature (action, comic book based) spell out everything, as if you wouldn't get it on your own.While I thoroughly enjoyed this film I also found it to be a bit frustrating. Like Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, The Guardians of the Galaxy actually has a deep and darker meaning. Beneath the explosions and punch-lines, the film is about the loss of loved ones. I'm not going to give the movie away for you but be aware that the film is about losing family and friends and how that affects your motivations and loves. If the film wasn't quite so formulaic, it would be one of the greatest films of its genre. Easily. The characters are deep enough and their motivations and loves are justified enough through rational traumas, that this film could have been Marvel's Dark Night. Unfortunately, for me, it's too predictable to hit that mark. I rate this film 3.5 out of 5 stars, and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. You can see this film in 3-D or 2-D at your local theater. Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun, entertaining romp that offers a lot of laughs, has a great soundtrack and is a guaranteed good time.Reviewed by Willie J, KIDS FIRST! Film CriticThe sweet sounds of 80's music, amazing stunts, hilarious one liners, a talking raccoon and a loving, giving tree named Groot are some of the highlights I like most about this film. Marvel has created a 3D futuristic adventure-comedy that explores the true meaning friendship. Chris Pratt plays Star-Lord who is a really good at making enemies and finds himself in trouble when Gamora, Rocket and Groot are after him for stealing the most powerful orb in the galaxy. One of my favorite scenes is when Star-Lord distracts Ronan from destroying the universe by singing Sweet Child and dancing. Everyone asks him what is he doing and he explains that this is what people do on Earth and he challenges Ronan to a dance off. A memorable moment is when Ronan comes charging toward the guardians and he says 'Star-Lord.' Star- Lord replies finally because everyone is always calling him by his real name, Peter Quill and he wants a cool superhero. It is funny that he is excited by people calling him his alias when he should be worried about getting blown to pieces.Alexandra Byrne, (known for designing costumes for Thor, The Avengers and Finding Neverland) has changed the look of costumes for Sci-Fi and adventure movies. Every costume has more depth for each character especially that of Star-Lord. In the opening scene, you see Star-Lord with a dark maroon cape and metal mask and then, when the aliens try to kill him he escapes by flying via his built-in rocket shoes. The cinematographer, Ben Davis, creates a galaxy never seen before. Throughout the movie I felt as if I was sucked into another galaxy filled with unique aliens and different landscapes.The moral of this film is that friendship is more important than anything. James Gunn shows how desperate all of the characters are to get 4 billion units and then get rid of each other. But, they are meant to do something greater together and that is to protect the galaxy and learn how to love others. I recommend this film for kids 12 to 18 and I give this five stars out of five stars.Reviewed by Shelby R. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Avengers: Age of Ultron," Another Monumental Marvel Movie!
","The Avengers assemble once again go up against a new corrupt, A.I. Ultron (James Spader). As the troupe pursue their mission, we're given a deeper understanding of our favorite super heroes. There are not enough words in the world to express how happy I am. As a Marvel fan, this film showcases some of my favorite comic book characters together in one plot line in a bigger and better way. When you are dealing with a sequel, as a filmmaker, you're pretty much trying to top yourself. Thankfully, the filmmakers have out done themselves here. We're given a superior conflict, more characters and action beyond epic proportions. I love this movie not only because it's a phenomenal Marvel film, but also an outstanding film in general. A movie is supposed to grab the audience and transport them to a universe with characters that not only we look up to but also identify with. Marvel has successfully created this reality. Every time I see a Marvel logo on a movie poster I'm excited to be sent back, once again, into their universe. Marvel is a genius entertainment company because they establish their characters in previous films. The Avengers are the protagonist. Every character is given their moment in the lime light but, they are not the main focus. They all share the screen and have their own personal conflict, yet they respond as team. That is not to say that there is no character development, there is. Former story lines help save time so that the writers can focus on perfecting the current story. This also leads to much stronger relationships between the characters. For people who have no history with Marvel films, I suggest that you see some of the previous films that feature the Avengers. The reason is that you may miss a connection with the characters that can be resolved by watching previous films. Although you will enjoy the action and story even without seeing the previous films, the inside jokes and interactions between characters become funnier when you understand the past. The action in this film is awesome! The word awesome is a very primitive word, but it explains everything. While I love to go to the movies and appreciate storytelling and 3 dimensional characters, there are times when I just want to see things go boom! Every Avenger, with his or her different abilities, works together and kicks butt. An example of this is when Thor hits Captain America's shield and causes a devastating explosion. You have to see it to believe it.My favorite character is, Vision (Paul Bettany) an android created by Ultron. Bettany is originally the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark's (Robert Downey, Jr.) A.I. companion. Bettany uses his fantastic voice to create Vision. I was excited when I heard he was going to be a new addition to the Avengers team. Not only is the acting and personality spot on, but the costume design is beautiful. There are so many scenes that I adore, but my favorite is when the Avengers, 'get acquainted' with Vision for the first time. This is the second A.I. the group has encountered and they're unsure if they can trust him. Vision is uncertain himself and gives a speech on why it doesn't matter because they all want to stop Ultron. At the end of his speech there is a comedic pay-off that shows which side Vision is truly on. The moral of the film is, 'The way to peace is not destruction.' Ultron is built for one reason - to create peace in our time. Ultron is confused on how to fulfill that mission and believes the only way to achieve his goal is to wipe out the human race and start over. However, Ultron underestimates the soul of man. I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11- to 18 year- olds. There is language and intense action that younger kids might not be able to handle. Check out this film in theaters May 1 and remember, a true Marvel fan stays to the end of the credits.Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Hotel Transylvania," Family Fun at 'Hotel Transylvania'
","'I am so happy to see a Halloween movie that is actually for everyone,' says KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Morgan Bertsch, age 7 (who also attended the animated film's red carpet event and interviewed Jon Lovitz and other stars whose voices 'appear' in it). Hotel Transylvania is full of monsters that are unfriendly toward humans, of course â€“ after all, what are monsters for? Even in the childhood classics from Grimm â€“ but our KIDS FIRST! youth film critics find it a fun entertainment for this Halloween season. 'I love the creative designs on how they make all the monsters to be nice and fluffy instead of mean and scary. The voices are brilliant; the special effects are so awesome,' says Cheyenne Nguyen. And Anthony Aranda puts it succinctly, 'This movie is awesome because it has lots of funny parts and has action, too.' Parents (and kids, too) can relate to Dracula's struggles as a parent, trying to shield his daughter from the unpleasantness and dangers that life may throw at her. She is, after all, only 118 years old! Hotel Transylvania Reviewed by Cheyenne Nguyen Interviews with Talent here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iVm_y3L6dI Video Review here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIkrr8pkLgw Hotel Transylvania is super hilarious and this movie lets us see how humans are viewed by monsters. The plot in this movie is the overprotective-father-and-his-teenage- daughter relationship and ZING at first sight. Dracula (Adam Sandler) runs Hotel Transylvania, a castle known to be completely cut off from humans. On his daughter Mavis' (Selena Gomez) 118th birthday, he invites his monster friends â€” such as the Mummy (CeeLo Green), Frankenstein (Kevin James), Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade) â€” to come and celebrate. However, his party is very predictable and boring. Mavis is now 118 years old and wants to experience the world and does not want to be in a kiddie's birthday party. Mavis is not having any fun at her own party. However, the party begins when a backpacking human named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) accidentally stumbles into the castle. My favorite part of this movie is when Dracula slashes out at his friends and point out all the annoying things for each monster and they are all offended. The truth is not very pretty sometimes. However, it does have many feel-good moments in his tantrum. The quality of the 3-D in this movie is awesome; you can see all the details of the monsters popping right in front of you! I jumped out of my seat several times. I love the creative designs on how they make all the monsters to be nice and fluffy instead of mean and scary. The voices are brilliant; the special effects are so awesome. The message in this movie is not to judge anyone until you get to know them. The only part I did not like is how the monsters view the humans as fat and mean. My favorite character is Jonathan. He is so fun to be around and always focuses on the good side of people or monsters. I rank this movie four out of five stars (due to some scary parts). I give this age ranged 5 and up.

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," If You're in the Neutral Category, You Might Give it a Shot
","KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, 15-year-old Raven Devanney, admits that she's never been a huge Twilight fan but found herself with new respect for this series now, even to the point of contemplating reading the books. Her review follows. Twilight, Breaking Dawn Pt. 2 by Raven Devanney, KIDS FIRST! Film CriticThis dramatic ending concludes the tale of Bella and Edward on their journey, defying the odds of love.I have never really been a fan of the Twilight series, never read any of the books or waited in line at the midnight premieres. I'm not a huge fan of dairy products, and this series contains an awful lot of cheese. But food jokes aside, I didn't completely dislike this film. Don't get me wrong there were definitely some parts that were way too dramatic, but overall I would say this is by far the best film in the Twilight Saga. The cinematography and special effects weren't anything different from the previous films, so I think they were pretty well done. However, I was very confused when I saw Renesmee. I couldn't tell if she was real or not because she looked so computer edited.I also have a problem with Bella's makeup in the opening scene. This movie picked up right where it left off and in the last film, the final scene was Bella lying on the table after she gave birth. When this movie started, it was Bella waking up on the table two days after the birth of her daughter. But her makeup and hair was perfect. If she had been unconscious for two days how would she have on spotless makeup? Another detail that I noticed that didn't seem right was Edward and Bella's new home. Who made it? And who could design, build and furnish an entire home in only two days? I pretty sure vampires don't have super-human- carpenter powers. One last visual detail that was weird for me was Renesmee's room. When you first see it, it's a nursery, but then a day or two later it's completely different and completely refurbished. How on earth do the Collins afford to refurbish their homes every week?!I can't say I have a favorite character because the acting done by each character is a little far fetched. I understand that the storyline itself is far from realistic, but I feel like all of the actors over- play their roles. I do have a favorite scene though. The final battle scene completely shocked me, and made me actually enjoy the movie. I haven't read the books so I had no idea what to expect, but I got completely sucked into it. I watched this film with my friend who isn't a Twilight fan either, but her and I were squealing in shock during the ending scene. After the movie I felt like such a nerd because I got so into the film, but in all honesty I actually enjoyed it. No, I will not become a Twi-hard fan now, but I do have a lot more respect for this series now. And I'm thinking about reading the books.This film is the most violent and sexual out of the whole series so I recommend it for ages 13 and up. Obviously if you're a huge Twilight fanatic, you're going to see this movie no matter what anybody else tells you. And if you completely despise the movies (which I'm sure some of you probably do) you're not going to see the film no matter what you're told. But if you're in the neutral category of loving/hating Twilight like I am, give it a shot and you might actually be surprised. Overall I give Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Pt. 2 - 4 out of 5 stars because it definitely surpassed my expectations.",Null,5,16,15 November 2012
La La Land," Like Films from The Golden Age
","La La Land is one of the most different and entertaining movies of recent times I have ever seen. The acting and the melodious musical numbers mesmerized me. The colorful setting and dresses also add to the cinematic flair. The story is about two aspiring people with dreams of what they want to become, Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone). Sebastian is an exceptional jazz pianist who wants to revive jazz with his own jazz club which he dreams to make and Mia dreams to be an exceptional actress. The two meet under random circumstances, somewhat rudely. Drawn together by their aspiration to do what they love, they fall for each other. However, their dreams conflict with their love for each other. Ryan Gosling excellently expresses his love for jazz and Mia. He enacts the piano playing part exceptionally well and it really looks like he is a gifted jazz pianist. Emma Stone is a show stealer as Mia with her expressive eyes, aspirations and acting skills, especially during the scenes where her character auditions and her chemistry with Ryan Gosling is amazing. John Legend, as Keith, utilizes his short on-screen time well, portraying a man with a different taste in jazz which Sebastian doesn't like, and he happens to be a good friend in need.Damien Chazelle's direction keeps the movie flowing from one beautiful musical number to the next. Mandy Moore's exceptional choreography charms us, particularly in 'A Lovely Night,' which was done in one-shot on a hilltop on Sunset, and includes amazing dancing from the main actors. My favorite scene is the scene in the planetarium with creative visuals such as Sebastian and Mia flying in the sky, dancing. Sebastian and Mia's dresses in the movie are spectacular and some of the best I have seen in a movie. The film is also shot in cinemascope which gives it the vibe of many golden Hollywood musicals.The movie has a positive message about Mia and Sebastian never giving up their dreams. Despite multiple failures, Mia still pursues her dreams about being an actress and the same with Sebastian about starting a jazz club. I give this movie 5, out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18. The only inappropriate thing about the movie is some of the language, but that is infrequent. This is a movie which everyone will enjoy. This film opens in theaters on December 25, 2016, so go and check it out for a unique musical unlike any other.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST!

Mama," If you're into anything Horror, Thriller or ghost related, then you'll love Mama
","In theaters now, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Raven Devanney bravely went to see a screening of the new thriller/chiller, 'Mama.' This PG-13 rated movie isn't for everyone, but if you are a fan of horror, and like to be scared silly, you shouldn't miss it. Though not the most original film, it packs a heavy fear-factor for every ghost-loving movie goer.Mama Reviewed by Raven Devanney, age 15, KIDS FIRST! Film CriticGo here to see Raven's full video review! http://www.you-tube.com/watch? v=HMV5t7V1V3U'Mama' tells the story of two young sisters, Lily and Victoria, who are abandoned in the woods for five years. When the girls are found and taken into custody by their uncle and his girlfriend Annabelle, everyone begins to wonder how these toddlers could have survived for so long on their own. The girls' strange behavior leads Annabell to believe that the girls weren't alone in the woods after all, and in fact, a troubled ghost called Mama was caring for them. But when they leave the forest, they don't leave Mama.I really enjoy this movie. It is definitely scary to watch, but when it is over it doesn't leave you feeling afraid. I'm convinced this movie is a mix between 'The Woman in Black' and 'The Possession.' It has a very similar ghost with the same motives as The Woman in Black, and has the same creepy bugs from 'The Possession.' The ending is especially similar to 'The Woman in Black.' No spoiler alerts or anything, but you think all will be fine but it's not. I guess you shouldn't go to a horror film if you're looking for a happy ending.I like the cinematography, and the use of lighting and sound track, to set the ominous mood for this film. The dull colors and grey wash of the scenery really helps the spook level of the movie. The one thing I have a real problem with was the animation of Mama's face in the last few scenes. This is supposed to be the height of the horror, the film's climax, but Mama's face is so unrealistic that it pulls me out of my horrified trance and I am no longer scared.My favorite character is Annabell (Jessica Chastain), because she isn't too enthusiastic about suddenly having to take on a motherly role, especially since the girls have serious social problems. Her boyfriend, the main caretaker of the kids, gets seriously injured, leaving Annabell in charge. I love watching her relationship develop into love for Lily and Victoria, and when Mama comes to play, she does a wonderful job showing her fear.My favorite scene is in the very beginning of the movie, when it shows how one-year-old Lily and three-year-old Victoria end up in the woods. It is a very twisted scene, but I like how they show the girls adapting to their new surroundings. They adapt through crayon drawings on the walls, which is very creative.I give Mama 4 out of 5 stars because it is definitely thrilling, but since it is so similar to some other films in this genre, I have to take a point away for lack of originality. I recommend 'Mama' for ages 13 and up because of its intense content. If you're into anything Horror, Thriller or ghost related, then you'll love Mama so go check it out!",8,0,1,6 February 2013
Rio," George Lopez Knows How To Make You Laugh
","This movie is about a blue macaw who is the last male of his kind. He travels with his owner Linda to Rio where the last female blue macaw lives. Some of the main characters in the movie are Blu, Jewel, and Rafael. Rafael is a toucan played by George Lopez. One of the best lines in the movie is when Blu is trying to fly and Rafael says, 'Alright Blu, you're flying! Sort of. Not really.' That is so funny. George Lopez has also played in another movie that I really loved called Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2. He always knows how to get the audience laughing.My favorite part of the movie is when Blu's owner Linda is waking up in the morning and is trying to turn her alarm off. When she thinks she has it off, all of a sudden she hears more loud noises and it turns out to be Blu! Every movie has to have a bad guy and this move is no exception. There are poachers that steal lots of different kinds of birds as well as their mean pet cockatoo Nigel who causes a lot of trouble throughout the movie. He also enlists the help of a group of monkeys that turn out to be no help to him at all. Another great part of the movie is when the birds and monkeys fight! It was a great action scene and of course the birds won. I would recommend this movie for all ages because it's such a good movie. There aren't really any scary parts and I think all ages would like it. Go out and see it in theaters when it premieres!Reviewed by Anthony Aranda, age 8, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic",8,0,0,7 July 2011
Beauty and the Beast," A Whimsical Yet Captivating Take on the Disney Classic
","Beauty and the Beast, directed by Bill Condon is a whimsical yet captivating film that I highly adored watching. This live action film has made my 'Top 10 List' due to its incredible singing performances, marvelous set designs and accuracy of the original Disney story. As a Disney fanatic myself, I absolutely love that this film has the power to take me back to my younger days. Daughter of a wise and humble merchant (Kevin Kline), Belle (Emma Watson) is a bright and independent young lady who will be taken as a prisoner by a monstrous beast (Dan Stevens) in place of her elderly, caring father. As prisoner of the Beast in his cold dark castle, Belle soon builds a strong bond with the talking enchanted objects of the castle. Who will help break the lasting 'forever curse' by bringing the Beast and Belle closer? Belle learns to look past the frightening physical appearance of the Beast and looks upon his caring gentle soul. But, will this be enough to break the lasting forever curse upon the castle and the Beast?Incorporated as a live action film from Disney's original animated film, Beauty and the Beast, the whole cast delivers exquisite performances portraying each unique and iconic character. The caring, yet brave Belle is played by the talented actress Emma Watson. Watson has appeared in numerous films including the Harry Potter films, My Week with Marilyn and The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Dan Stevens, known from Legion TV Series deftly portrays the terrifying Beast, a difficult character to play due to its temper. From the songs, to the set designs, this film has it all. I truly appreciate and love that they took the 1991 Disney classic and turned it into a live action film. This is something that has not been seen before and was well directed by Bill Condon (Mr. Holmes, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn â€“ Part 1 and 2, Dreamgirls). Being a huge Disney princess fan, I am highly pleased with the accuracy of this live action version. The costumes, songs, characters and plot are all very accurate. It made me feel as if I was in a Disney story book. One of favorite things about this film and the story of Beauty and the Beast itself, is the message it depicts â€“ that of looking past the physical and looking within. This is a moral that every viewer can learn from. The film is very successful in massaging this message and the audience will easily relate to the moral as the film unfolds before their eyes.This enchanted, unbelievable film deserves 5 out of 5. I highly recommend it to families, young children and Disney fanatics. Kids and adults both will enjoy watching it and singing along with the iconic songs. Reviewed by Maria G., KIDS FIRST!

Les MisÃ©rables," Loved seeing the world of Les Miserables on a grand scale. It is exactly as I imagined. When it was over I wanted to see it again immediately.
","The epic musical Les Miserables tells the story of a man named jean Valjean played by Hugh Jackman set during the dawn of the French revolution. After serving 19 years as a slave because he stole a loaf of bread, he breaks parole and spends years reinventing himself as a new man. Jean is being hunted by officer Javert played by Russell Crowe, who swears he will not rest until Jean is behind bars. While running from Javert, Jean Valjean finds himself caring for a factory workers young daughter, Cosette. The young child changes his life forever.Les Miserables is honestly one of the greatest films I have ever seen. This film is almost three hours long and I still wanted it to go on longer. Les Miserables is a very well known Broadway musical and it stays so true to the play it is unbelievable. Not a single word is off. However, the one thing that changes for the better is they made the movie easier to understand and follow. I have been a huge fan of Les Mis for a long time and I know almost every single song by heart. I was trying so hard not to start singing along with the film, the musical score was amazing. The whole film is better than I could have ever hoped for, but seeing this tale up on the big screen was phenomenal! The visuals and special effects are truly breathtaking. It is set in France at the beginning of the French revolution when life for the poor was awful and life for the rich was grand. They capture the hard times of the streets perfectly by using dark colors and wonderful lighting contrasts. I loved seeing the world of Les Mis on a grand scale and it is exactly as I imagined it would be. I love this entire movie so much that when it was over I immediately wanted to see it again. I'm definitely going to see it again when it comes out in theaters. I have so many scenes that I love so much, but my favorites are the Lovely Ladies scene and the Master of the House scene. I like the Lovely Ladies scene because that's where Fantine, Cosette's mother turns to the streets as a home after losing her job at the factory. It is a wonderful musical number and Anne Hathaway's performance is amazing! It is so historically accurate showing how people would do anything to make a quick penny from selling their teeth, to chopping off their hair, it was hard for everyone. I also love the Master of the House scene because it is so hilarious. It has Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the innkeeper and his wife. They con people into staying the night at their inn, then trick them into never leaving. They are so crafty and hilarious and they rob everyone blind. This scene is so clever and hilarious. Sacha and Helena make an amazing duo. I love all of the characters equally, but I'll only pick a few to talk about. Jean Valjean is a truly amazing character and Hugh Jackman brings him to life so well. Hugh's talents are really shown off during this film and I was very impressed by him. Fantine, played by the remarkable Anne Hathaway is a very memorable character. Anne is perfect as Fantine and this was, in my opinion, her best role. The last character that I really enjoyed is Eponine played by Samantha Barks. Eponine sings all of my favorite Les Mis songs and her incredible duo of A Little Fall of Rain with Eddie Redmayne. A little fun fact is that Samantha Marks played Eponine in the Broadway version of Les Mis. Overall, I give Les Miserables 5 out of 5 stars because it is truly the most amazing film I've seen in a long time and it far surpassed my expectations. This film is definitely for ages 13 and up because of the dark period it is set in and the violence and cruelty that occurs. Raven Devanney, age 15, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10,4,7,8 January 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," More Thrilling and Hilarious Than its Predecessor
","Set to 'Awesome Mixtape #2', Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. #2 is more thrilling and hilarious than its predecessor. It is an action packed, sci-fi adventure about a group of intergalactic criminals who are tasked to work together to save the universe. Chris Pratt again stars as Peter Quill, aka Star Lord. The rest of the cast follows suit - Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax, Vin Diesel as the voice of Groot and Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket. The film starts out with the classic 70s song 'Brandi' by Looking Glass as we see two young people driving down the highway, very much in love. We later learn that this is the back story of Peter's conception and is foreshadowing the main storyline of the film. The movie jumps 34 years and Peter is now Star Lord, captain of a band of reformed outlaws. The group is hired to guard the uber batteries of the Sovereign planet. Upon leaving, Rocket steals some of the batteries and a space battle ensues. Star Lord and his crew are shot down and make an emergency landing on a nearby planet. Before landing, they notice a mysterious spaceship, which takes out the entire Sovereign fleet pursuing them. The rest of the film is an emotional, action-packed adventure, having to do with this mysterious personage. There are lots of battles between different factions in this crazy sci-fi, fantasy universe. The movie has lots of lively and entertaining scenes. My favorite is when Rocket Raccoon uses traps to his advantage to defeat an incoming horde of ravagers. Every scene with Drax is terrific because he has a different philosophy of life and has the most infectious laugh of any character in any movie, ever. I also love how Peter is obsessed with 80s pop culture. He references them all the time, but his companions never understand them, because they didn't grow up on Earth. I especially love how 80s music is used to evoke nostalgia from Peter's childhood, making for a terrific oldies soundtrack.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is phenomenal and full of whimsical jokes that don't get old. It is a perfect family adventure that is suitable for ages 10 to 18. Parents and grandparents will even get a kick out of it. I rate this film 4 out of 5 stars for its engaging humor and captivating action. Reviewed by Clayton P. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",8,4,10,2 May 2017
Titanic," Epic Love Story 'Titanic' Now on DVD and Blu-ray
","Titanic, newly released from Paramount Pictures on Blu-ray3D and digital, didn't completely sweep the Academy Awards in 1998 â€“ it only took 11 of the Oscar statuettes! Among them: Best Picture, a Best Director for James Cameron and a Best Cinematography for Russell Carpenter. Some of that sweeping cinematography is bound to be lost on a home screen, but home surround-sound can do a nice job on its Oscar- winning Best Sound. Seasoned KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Raven Devanney, age 15, calls Titanic a 'romantic masterpiece.' The film evokes strong emotion partly because of the real-life tragedy it recreates but also thanks to the intimate love story Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet bring to life. That the film is 15 years old does not diminish its impact. Says Raven, 'Â… even though I've seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up.' On a scale of one to five, she rates it a five only because higher numbers aren't available. TitanicReviewed by Raven Devanney See her full review on video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huGlaj1F_d0 Titanic is my favorite movie by far. This romantic masterpiece starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet tells a tale of love, loss and tragedy. I remember the first time I watched Titanic. I was 7 years old, and I've been hooked ever since. This was the first film that really made me cry, and even though I've seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up. This movie is beautifully done. I love that the cinematography is so grand and breathtaking even though the film came out in 1997. I especially love the way they capture the Titanic in all its glory. I'm a total history geek when it comes to the Titanic. I've seen every documentary and read every book there is to read about the Titanic, so the fact that they used actual footage of the wreckage of Titanic was really cool. My favorite characters are Rose and Jack, of course! They defy the rules of their different social statuses and are in true love. Not only are those characters great, but Kate and Leonardo do a masterful job in these roles. I love the whole movie, but my favorite scene would have to be when Rose and Jack are running through the ship away from the butler after the drawing scene. It lightens the mood of the film before the sinking and is quite funny. Plus, you almost get a mini tour of the ship. I also admire the final few scenes in which the ship is sinking. The way it is captured is amazing. It's the perfect mix of chaos and emotion, which really conveys the tragedy in a brilliant way. Like I said, this film is very tragic, and that fact that it was an actual event makes it even more sad. I would recommend this film for all ages, even though it is sad and slightly inappropriate. I watched it when I was 7 and nothing bothered me. This is a must-see movie, and I give it five out of five stars. I'd give it more if I could! Titanic is in stores now on DVD and Blu-ray, so be sure to add it to your home movie collection today!",10,2,3,29 October 2012

Ice Age 4 picks up where Scrat still did not catch that acorn and the results of his chasing after the acorn that made the continent drift apart. The story is about Manny (Ray Romano), an over protective father who tries to keep his teenage daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) from hanging out with the bad group of mammoths. Peaches is desperate to prove that she is cool so she can hang out with the cool kids. Manny and his daughter have a fight in front of her friends and the last thing Peaches says to her father is 'I wish you were not my father'. This is when the earth shakes; Manny, Diego and Sid are separated from the rest of the pack. They encounter ice pirates and many different sea creatures. They all are home sick and want to find a way home. However, the ice pirate wanted to capture them as prisoners. Manny and his gang have to come up with a plan to escape from the pirates and use his ice ship to go home. This movie has a lot of jokes that made me laugh throughout the movie. The love story between Diego and the white tiger Shira (voice by Jennifer Lopez) is so cute. The 3D is totally awesome. The message of this movie is about the importance of family and how we do not have a choice picking who is in our family. My favorite character in this movie is Granny. Everything about her is funny and unpredictable. One thing that I did not like is that there are too many new characters. Also, I would like to see more of Granny. I rank this movie 5 out of 5 stars because it's exciting, funny and all the characters are so strong and different. I recommend this movie for ages 3 to 18",Null,0,0,3 August 2012
Dark Shadows," Surpassed My Expectations
","The film Dark Shadows opened to an eagerly awaiting audience of both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans. Based on the ABC daytime show which aired during the late 1960s which generated a cult following, what was taken seriously in the late 60s / early 70s comes across as comedy today. The majority of the movie is set in 1972 and incorporates music from the Moody Blues (Nights in White Satin) with appearances by Karen Carpenter in a TV scene, a cameo appearance by Alice Cooper and appearances by four of the original Dark Shadows actors including Jonathan Frid who passed away shortly after filming. Rated PG-13 for comic horror violence, sexual content , drug use, language and smoking, one of our 14-year-old critics, Raven Devanney rated it 6 out of 5 stars for ages 13 and up. Here's her take: Dark Shadows Reviewed by Raven Devanney http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2NE6UPSLcM Dark Shadows is a hilarious movie about a man named Barnibus Collins, who is cursed by an evil witch when he refuses to give her his love. Turned into a vampire, Barnibus is locked away in a coffin for two centuries. Now, freed by unsuspecting construction workers, Barnibus finds that his home town of Collins Port has drastically changed. He must learn to fit into the 70s while protecting his family, restoring Collins Port to its former glory and riding himself of the evil witch, Angelique, who cursed him to be a creature forced to hide in dark shadows. I absolutely loved this movie. Johnny Depp, who plays Barnibus Collins, did fantastic! Johnny is one of my all time favorite actors and when he teams up with director Tim Burton, you know it's a film worth seeing. The cinematography was great because of the gloominess that you will often find in Tim Burton's films, but they found a flawless way to thrown in the bright colors of the 70's. The special effects were great too, especially in the end when Angelique's skin started to crack; she really looked as if she was made out of porcelain. Something that did bother me about the visuals was that the blood in the film looked way to fake considering that it is a vampire movie. My favorite character would have to be that daughter of the Collins family played by Chloe Moretz. One; she is my favorite young actress, two; she played a moody, mellow dramatic, angsty teenager perfectly. The acting in this film was priceless because there was a lot of over- acting, but not in a cheesy way, it was done very purposefully and it gave a wonderful comedic feel to dramatic situations. I suggest this film for ages 13 and up because of sexual situations, mild drug use and language. I would give this film 6 out of 5 stars because it far surpassed my expectations!",10,51,79,29 October 2012

Bilbo and his company of Dwarfs have just unleashed the Dragon Smaug upon a small lakeside village and chaos breaks loose. Once word is out that the dragon has been driven from the mountain, armies from all over the land come to battle for the treasures that lie inside. It is a fight unlike any before and Bilbo must find a way to make peace before it is too late. I really enjoyed this film. From the very beginning it is full of action, epic battles and suspense. The graphics in this entire series are stunning. The Hobbit never fails to impress me with its immaculate visuals and special effects. The soundtrack to this film is beautiful, as expected, since the rest of the series is filled with wonderful music. I think that this film is the perfect closure to the series that so many have fallen in love with and been loyal fans of over the years.I'm also very impressed with the fact that this trilogy of films is adapted from one, relatively short novel and every film is so packed full of action and adventure, there is never a dull moment.The cast is marvelous as usual. Martin Freeman is the perfect actor to play Bilbo Baggins because he embodies his personality so well. It's been wonderful to watch Bilbo's character develop over the course of these films. He starts off very timid and unsure of himself, but by the end of the final film he has so much new found confidence from all he's been through and is a completely different hobbit than he was at the beginning of the journey.I'm very sad that the series has come to an end and that the journey is over, but I'm glad for the closure and amazed at how well this film turned out. Lord of the Rings fans will clearly love this film, but I think anyone who enjoys action, adventure and fantasy will love this film as well. There is a considerable amount of violence since the majority of the movie is an epic battle, so I suggest this film be viewed by ages 13 to 18-year-olds. If you have seen any of the previous films from The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings series, then this film should be suitable for you.I give The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies 5 out of 5 stars.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," This Classic Truly Withstands the test of Time. It's As Beautiful Today as Ever!
","Before Cinderella lost her slipper and before Aladdin met the Genie, Walt Disney did his most crazy and insane project ever - a feature animated movie, the first of its kind. The title of the film is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Parents and kids loved this film decades ago and, a generation later, families can now enjoy this beautiful classic in Blu-Ray.Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a musical with catchy, and beautiful singing done by Adriana Caselotti, (Snow White), Lucille La Verne (Queen) and others. There is also a sense of adventure, and a magical romance, between Snow White and the Prince.The story begins when the Queen discovers that she is not the fairest of them all, and that Snow White is. Out of jealousy, she orders the death of Snow White. However, Snow White gets away. She comes upon 7 dwarfs which she befriends. The Queen angrily learns about her failed death, and decides to poison the young princess!Since this is the Diamond Edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it is packed with extra features including a tour of the animation studios in the 1930s, actual interviews with Walt Disney, cool facts, (Did you know Snow White was originally designed to have gold hair? Who knew!) and so much more. My favorite part concentrates on how Walt Disney hired over 300 artists, how he spent so much money on making it perfect, and just how much speculation and hate he got for attempting to make (and being very successful as a result) a 90 minute animated film.Even though this film was made almost a century ago, the quality of the animation is as good as films made today. Hand-drawn animation has a quality of from the human touch that CGI can never achieve. In terms of the soundtrack, Walt Disney had a knack for making his animated films not only have background music, but he created it in such as way that the music becomes an integral part of the story. For example, when Snow White and the Prince first meet, they sing a song together and it represents almost, 'Instant love,' better than words ever could. This story is based on a classic European fairy tale, and Walt Disney hired a few people who specifically made European-styled drawings, to make the film feel like the original fairy tale, which was perfect for the film. The voice-over sound quality is also top notch, amazingly so since again, it was made almost 100 years ago. I would easily compare it to the voice over acting and quality of the late 90s. This film was ambitious in terms of being the first animated feature film, but also was first feature film to have a female lead.My favorite scene is the meeting of The Prince and Snow White. In the scene, Snow White is cleaning outside and she explains to her bird friends what a wishing well is. A prince overhears her fantastic singing and is love-struck when he meets her. This scene is one of my favorites because the music is beautiful, the animation is spectacular and this scene specifically illustrates my point about European artists designing the backgrounds. It really looks like a European castle of some sort.This film was designed for all ages and I still agree. I recommend it for ages 6 to 13 specifically. Younger kids will enjoy the bright colors, dancing and singing. Older kids can appreciate how difficult it was to make this film and the storyline itself. Adults who have happy memories of seeing this film years ago will also enjoy it. Overall, it's a great film for the family. I rate it 5 out of 5 stars because of the spectacular animation, exciting story (typical of films made by Walt Disney) and clear voice acting.",Null,6,6,4 February 2016
The Secret Life of Pets," Loved it! Completely funny and silly
","I could not wait to see The Secret Life of Pets and I was not disappointed! I LOVED it! The Secret Life of Pets is an animated comedy that is both funny and sincere. It is about a dog named Max (Louis C.K.), his new brother Duke (Eric Stonestreet) and their friends. Max doesn't like Duke so he does things that he hopes will get him kicked out of the family home. One day Max comes up with an idea that he hopes will get Duke taken away. His idea backfires and causes Max and Duke to get caught and almost sent to the pound. Will Max and Duke get home? Will their friends find them and help them get home? My favorite character is Gidget (Jenny Slate) who is a white little dog who likes Max. She is very sweet and kind, but when it comes to helping her friends, she will fight anyone. This is a funny trait of Gidget's because she is a super sweet dog but she will fight to protect her loved ones.My favorite scene is when Duke and Max are in a wiener factory and there is a little song where the hot dogs come to life. Little kids might not like this scene because the singing hot dogs get eaten by Duke and Max and they eat the hot dog's heads off.Though there are many morals to this movie, the most important is 'Do not judge someone before you get to know them.' Max doesn't like Duke when he first comes, but later on he learns to appreciate him. The Secret Life of Pets is a funny cartoon about cute animals, but it may not appeal to younger audiences. There are some scenes that might be too scary for little kids. Also, Max and Duke say this to save their lives but, be forewarned they do say 'put their owner in the blender.'I recommend The Secret Life of Pets for kids ages 5 to 15 due to the scary scenes. Older audiences may like this movie if they love animals and fun cartoons. I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars because it is entertaining and about my favorite subject...animals!Reviewed by Mia A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",9,28,54,1 July 2016
Arrival," Extremely High Wow Factor - A Must Go for any Sci-Fi Fan
","This movie can only be described as something that starts out with a very simple idea and ends up turning into a complex and exciting story. Arrival is a truly sci-fi movie that you watch with your mouth open in amazement that gets better by the minute with an unforgettable and unpredictable ending. Arrival begins when 12 UFOs touch down in random places on Earth. The whole world is panicking and the United States looks to a talented linguist named Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and a gifted Theoretical Physicist named Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) to help translate what the aliens really want from us and what their purpose on Earth is. Once the new team starts uncovering the information about the mysterious species, they find very surprising things that go against everything we once knew. The movie is great overall but the ending is what really makes Arrival so legendary. The special effects are spectacular and the acting is extraordinary. Amy Adams excels in her role of Dr. Banks. What I most liked about the movie is how it all comes together. Without spoiling anything, I will say that the ending is mysterious and can be interpreted in hundreds of different ways depending on what angle you look at it from. The only other movies that have such perfect endings and make you actually think deeply about what exactly is happening are Interstellar and Inception. Another thing about this film that blew me away is the cinematography. From giant aerial shots of 1500 foot UFOs to a fleet of battleships about to start an attack, the cinematography truly adds to the intensity and amazement of the film. My one small criticism has to do with the last few minutes. The creators stretch it out about five minutes too long in their attempt to show in very deep detail what exactly happens at the end. I feel like they could have shortened it and explained the ending instead of stretching it out, but that only lasts a couple of minutes and is hardly noticeable. Another huge perk is the sound editing and the soundtrack. The sounds of the UFOs and the aliens are intense and the music perfectly suits the story. This combination makes your heart thump and works wonders with surround sound. My favorite scene is when the aliens first start writing in their language. They write using something that resembles ink that stays in the air. It is truly beautiful and unique. It is unlike anything else I've ever seen before in a sci-fi movie with aliens. I also like this scene because it is when they start talking about their language and how they talk backward and forward at the same time. If they think like this, they can write and create a complex sentence in a split of a second, which amazed me. I also admired how the story treats their language almost like an art form and not just a way of communication.There is a presence of some mature language in a few scenes as well as very intense and dramatic moments, so I recommend it for ages 13 to 18. I give it 5 out of 5 stars despite one small hiccup because of just how it makes you think about life and the future and gets your adrenaline pumping.Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!

Wonder Woman," Lives up to its Hype
","When this movie was announced, I was super excited, but at the same time, skeptical. Because all the recent DC Movies didn't live up to all the hype. However, once I sat down in the theatre, all comfortable with my popcorn and icee and watched the film, I can say that it is absolutely amazing! It definitely lives up to its potential. Once the movie was over, I started clapping and, after I left the theatre, I realized my hands were red because I had clapped so hard.The story of this film starts on Themyscira, an island cloaked from society and home to the Amazons. Diana, Princess of the Amazons, finds an allied spy who washed on shore named Steve Trevor. He tells her about the horrors of World War l and she decides to join him to stop The War to End All Wars.Gal Gadot plays Wonder Woman and, oh my gosh, she is awesome! She is courageous and fierce, but also intelligent and empathetic. She is the perfect role model for every little girl. She is the iconic Wonder Woman! But in all seriousness, all the actors are awesome and really likable. One particular character that didn't get enough screen time was Steve's secretary, Eta Candy, played by Lucy Davis. She is really funny and has some great one liners. She really deserved more time to shine. The special effects and fight scenes are also extraordinary. During most of the action scenes, I found myself leaning forward, wide-eyed and gripping my seat. Unlike Batman V Superman or Suicide Squad, I could actually SEE what was happening! To me, the best scene in the movie is when Diana, Steve and his crew lead an invasion of a German controlled town and liberate it. The action is so exciting and, when the Wonder Woman theme starts playing, I literally started smiling until the scene was over. Surprisingly, this film is also extremely hilarious. I was laughing for a good chunk of time. The humor mainly comes from Diana's lack of knowledge of our civilization. There's a really funny scene where Eta tries to give Diana a normal outfit and she kicks and rips the skirt. I definitely give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. This movie opens in theatres on June 2, 2017. I could say I recommend this movie for comic book fans, but honestly everyone should see this movie. Wonder Woman is an iconic role model and Gal Gadot definitely lives up to the part. Director Patty Jenkins lassoed this hit film and I love that a woman directed it - Girl Power! That's the truth.Reviewed by Calista B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10,15,31,1 June 2017
Despicable Me," Silly Storyline, Wonderful Animation
","Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules is a fantastic sequel in the Wimpy series. This film is a super fun adaptation from the popular book series Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I really enjoy that it shows the relationship between Greg and Rodrick, because it shows the ups and downs of being siblings. I especially like the fact that I related to this movie so much. I have a brother, like Greg, and I'm also a middle-schooler. I feel that this film truly captures a lot of the real struggles of middle school life. My favorite character is Greg Heffley, played by Zachary Gordon, because he gets into so many funny embarrassing situations. I had the privilege to talk with him in a recent interview. His favorite scene is when he and Rodrick run from their coach over the dumpster, because it was so fun to do. This is also my favorite scene because when Rodrick and Greg are pranking all the people and running from their coach at the gas station, they really bond. This wonderful movie is for everyone because it is funny for an audience of many different age groups. Overall I give Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules two thumbs up.

X-Men: First Class," Best in the X-Men Saga
","X-Men First Class is an epic adventure revealing the origins of the X-Men Saga. It is set in the 1960s at the beginning of the Space Age and at the height of the Cold War. Russia and the U.S.A are on the brink of a nuclear war, endangering the whole world.Before they took the names of Professor X and Magneto, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) were two youthful mutant men just discovering their powers. They search for other mutants, like themselves, to recruit so they can band together and stop a very great threat to the world.X-Men First Class answers a lot of questions that have interested many fans since X-Men came out, such as: how did Charles get put in a Wheelchair, how they got their names Magneto and Professor X, and how the X-Men got together in the first place.The acting in this character driven movie is great and was cast really well, especially Kevin Bacon as the evil Sabastian Shaw and Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique. There are a lot of psychological parts during the movie, and it's not just comic book action. You really can get the emotional depth. This movie had messages in it. Mystique in this movie started out not liking herself at all, trying to cover up who she was, she was ashamed of who she was. By the end, though, Mystique learns to except herself and before she leaves says, 'Mutant, and proud!' This means that you should accept yourself and be who you want to be.The action scenes in this movie were very well set up and suspenseful, you couldn't have the movie or the storyline without it. This movie was pretty violent, has a lot of fighting, and some traumatic scenes (like when the Nazi Schmit shoots Erik's mom right in front of him.) It also has a little explicit language and a couple of sexy scenes. Rated PG-13, I would not recommend it for kids under the age of 13.Over all, I think this movie was the best one yet in the X-Men Saga.Reviewed by Jonah Menegaz, age 13, KIDS FIRST!

The Dark Knight Rises," a true hero can be anyone. . . it starts with a simple act of kindness.
","The true test of a hero is to be able to face your darkest fears and rise above. Twelve-year-old KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Julianna No one shares her review with us: video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIfyCVh9UcYThis film begins 8 years after the last film, with Batman hiding from the police and Bruce Wayne hiding from life. Christian Bale continues in the dual role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and does a tremendous job in the role. In this last film of Nolan's trilogy, Gotham City's rich are prospering in the post Harvey Dent era. Little does anyone realize that a storm is coming, in the form of the ruthless terrorist, Bane, played brilliantly by Tom Hardy. Throw in a beautiful cat burglar, Selina Kyle (a.k.a. â€“ 'Catwoman'), played by Anne Hathaway, a modern day, female Robin Hood, who steals from the rich to give to the poor and soon enough, darkness falls over Gotham City. The question is, will Batman return to save Gotham? And better yet, if he does, is there any chance he can stop Bane, the physically superior and heartless monster who unleashes his fury upon Gotham. There is a great ensemble cast in this film, starting with Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon; Joseph Gordon- Levitt as rookie policeman, Officer Blake; Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox and Michael Caine as Alfred, amongst others. My favorite character is Selina Kyle/Catwoman because though she is a cat burglar, she only steals from the rich who can spare to give up some of their wealth. She also is very capable to take care of herself and isn't afraid of anyone. My favorite scene is one of the climactic scenes in the film, where Catwoman tells Batman that she will help him open the tunnel to allow the City's residents to escape, but that she is not staying to help further and believes he shouldn't either. She shows her true colors, by coming back to save Batman from Bane, and helps him fight to save the city. The cinematography is fantastic, from the opening scene where Bane hijacks a plane and escapes in mid-air to the fight scenes that were shot on Wall Street in downtown NYC. The CGI is amazing. How they made the football stadium field implode and the shots of the bridges being blown, were so realistic it is a bit frightening. In all three films, they have had the best gadgets for Batman to use and in this film, they didn't let us down. They created a cross between a car; a helicopter and a plane that could basically do anything. They call it the 'Bat'. It's a great addition to Batman's gadgets. The musical score, by Hans Zimmer is so well done, it adds to the intensity of the critical moments of the film. Overall, I rate this fill 4 out of 5 stars, as there are many new characters that spread out the storyline and make the film a bit long. Plus terroristic threats, which are eerily similar to many real-life threats today, make for a chilling storyline. Don't get me wrong though, I love this film. The violence makes the film appropriate for ages 13 to adult. It's a great ending to a great trilogy . . . . or is it ?? Remember, it doesn't matter who you are,",8,2,6,3 August 2012
Black Panther," Pure Marvel Action/Adventure Steeped in Timely Political and Social Issues
","In the latest production from Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), we see the original story of the Black Panther. We were introduced to the Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. This film depicts the story of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and the Black Panther tribe. 
 
When T'Challa returns home to the reclusive, beautiful and technologically impressive nation of Wakanda, a fictional country in Africa, he is named the new leader following the death of his father. True to custom, he is challenged by the tribesman and becomes the new King. Elsewhere, a cousin unknown to him returns from the United States to challenge T'Challa's reign, and chaos ensues. Warmonger (Michael B Jordan) and his political beliefs are diabolical and the opposite of T'Challa's. As foes set forth to destroy Wakanda, Black Panther teams up with a C.I.A. agent and a neighboring tribe to prevent the country from a world war. The path from light to dark, and back to doing good in the world beyond Wakanda is refreshing.The film is pure Marvel action-adventure with a broad political and socially aware feeling. It is awake and unique. It may be a superhero film, yet it is also steeped in real political and social issues similar to those we face today, especially diversity and inclusion. The strong female characters - Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ramonda (Angela Bassett) are phenomenal. 
 
I love this film! From the casting, cinematography and directing, to the special effects and female empowerment, it is fulfilling. The action is believable, many of the fight scenes are based on African martial arts, although the CGI at times is a little whack. Overall, I was displaced, forgetting I was sitting in a theater. The costumes are fantastic with attention to detail befitting royalty. Wakanda forever!I give this film 5 out of 5 stars for the cast, social and political awareness, technology focus and female empowerment. This film will appeal to ages 10 to 18, as well as adults. I caution younger viewing due to fight scenes which may be disturbing.Reviewed by Kimbirly O., KIDS FIRST! Juror.",9,10,43,15 February 2018
Black Panther," Easily one of the greatest comic-book films I've seen!
","Black Panther is a stunning first solo outing for its title character that wowed me with its strong ensemble cast, inventive visuals and multi-layered story. Black Panther follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), King of Wakanda, an advanced and highly powerful territory that is disguised as a third-world country. He also protects his nation and its people as a masked vigilante called the Black Panther. After the death of his father, T'Challa is chosen to take the throne and receive the powers of the panther god. Just after his extravagant coronation, a threat finds its way into Wakanda's borders by Erik Killmonger. Killmonger is a fierce and skilled soldier who wishes to replace T'Challa and usher in a new age for the country. T'Challa will be tested and must protect the throne from Killmonger.My favorite character is Shuri (Letitia Wright), T'Challa's whizkid sister who helps him maintain the mantle of Black Panther and stay one step ahead of the villains he faces. Letitia Wright delivers hilarious one-liners with near perfect timing. She nails the rapport between Shuri and her brother, interacting in a way that is both believable and develops both their characters.An outstanding performance in this film comes from Michael B. Jordan who is brilliant as Killmonger. He abandons the genre's usual vague 'destroy-the-world' motivation and creates a genuinely complicated character. Jordan has cutthroat moments that make you dread his presence, but his sinister manner is evened out by moments where you come to sympathize with his character.The deep, emotional part of the film's story is unexpected and caught me by surprise. It is an important moment for the main character and what drives his actions for the rest of the film. Sometimes, these comic-book heroes make poor decisions and have to fight against their own demons as well as the bad guys. This has been done before in both comics and film, but here we really see T'Challa change through his experiences. I recommend this film to ages 12 to 18. There is some action and violence with spears and swords that feels more violent than what I'm used to from comic book films. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars. Black Panther is easily one of the greatest comic-book films I've seen. Period.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Did not enjoy
","Straight up, I say I did not enjoy this movie. It is confusing and the title is misleading. This movie starts off with Batman, otherwise known as Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), at his parents' funeral. Then it switches scenes and shows his parents being murdered, then back to the funeral. This is probably the least confusing part. And then, Bruce falls into a hole and is saved by a swarm of bats, yeah a bit more confusing, but now we know what inspired him! Many years later, Superman (Henry Cavill) flies through the building that is Bruce's adopted father's office while battling some random alien invasion that is never explained and destroys the rest of the building with his laser vision. I think this might be part of why they fight, but I don't know. That was unclear. By this point in the movie, my brain started to not understand what is going on at all. I asked my dad what was going on and he told me that it would make sense soon, but it never does.This movie is a disgrace to DC comics because there is almost no point. I will explain as best as I can why without spoiling it. First, I will answer a big question, 'Why are two legendary heroes battling?' I don't even know. You might better understand why this movie is so completely confusing. Another reason that this movie's title is very misleading is the battle has no meaning. It is only what happens next that matters. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth, but these are my favorites parts of this film: My favorite character was Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg). Even though his lines were not so good, he made everything sound like the good, well bad, Lex Luthor that I know. My favorite costume and props are most definitely Batman's super armor and his gadgets. But, Batman and Superman do something confusing just because they have a super random connection! Some of you may have seen the famous Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) in the trailer, but she practically has 2% as much of a role as she does in the trailer. I recommend this movie for ages 15 to 18 due to the jump scares, blood, screaming, death, guns and bullets, and many more horrible and violent things. I give it 2 and a half stars out of five stars because it is confusing, has no moral lesson and does not even match its title. This film is in theaters now if you wish to check it out.

Monsters University," 'Monsters University': A Refreshing Prequel From Pixar
","Everyone's favorite monsters from 'Monsters Inc.,' plus a few more, are back in 'Monsters University.' This time, instead of telling the story of what happened next, they've created a prequel to show us how the monsters first became friends and give us more insight into the characters. Mike, Sulley and the gang bring a ton of laughs to the screen as they learn how to become 'scarers' and become best buddies in the process. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Jailene A., age 13 especially loves the animation in this film, 'every character has its own personality and special features, as none of the monsters look exactly the same.' She was excited to see an advance screening of 'Monsters University' and shares her thoughts below.'I just watched 'Monsters University' and it is an amazing prequel to Disney Pixar's classic 'Monster Inc.' 'Monsters University' is the back- story of how Sully and Mike Wazowski became the best friends they were in 'Monsters Inc.' It all starts in college, from day one Mike has been a perfect student ever since he decided he wanted to be a top scarer when he grows up. That is his dream and he works hard to accomplish it. Sully, on the other hand thinks everything is going to be handed to him because he's a Sullivan and his father is the ultimate top scarer. Everything changes when both of them get kicked out of the scare program. This is when Mike and Sully must work together to prove they can be worthy of scaring. There's a surprise plot twist at the end that you'd have to watch to see what happens.I like the concept of 'Monsters University' just as the original 'Monsters Inc.' touched the hearts of many in 2001. However, no one really knew how they became best friends in the beginning. This is what makes the concept of this movie so interesting because of the fact that normally you would see the movie of how they met first and then see them continue their life in a sequel. I also like the animation in this movie. Every character has its own personality and special features, as none of the monsters look exactly the same. Some have tentacles, some have more than two eyes and some monsters are scarier than others, but everyone has something in common: they all want to be a scarer.All the characters are very amazing but my favorite character is Mike Wazowski. When Mike was little, everyone always made fun of him for being too small and no one thought he would accomplish anything in life. He works hard to get into Monsters University because he is determined to succeed and in the end, he may not get what he wants but he is still happy, and that's what is important.My favorite scene is when Mike and Sully are in the first round of the scare games and they have to race through a dark tunnel with spiky balls on the floor that make you blow up like a marshmallow. Both of them come out of the race with a puffy lip and swollen legs because they touched the spiky balls and they could barely talk. It made me laugh a lot.I recommend 'Monsters University' for ages 6-14. It is an amazing family movie and kids will love it.

Saving Mr. Banks," Dramatic Inside Look Behind the Scenes of Mary Poppins
","This is a deeply emotional and inspiring untold story of 'Mary Poppins.' The premise is based on the true journey of Pamela L. Travers (Emma Thompson), the author of the book. We learn it's going to take Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) a lot of hard work to get Ms. Travers to share our favorite flying nanny, Mary Poppins.This film is totally character driven. Tom Hanks is the first actor to portray Walt in a mainstream film. Tom trained for this by visiting 'The Walt Disney Family Museum' and talking with Disney's former employees including his daughter Diane Disney Miller. Tom is Walt! He captures the dream, drive, and love for life that Walt believed in and you buy every word he says. They also respect Walt's wishes of never showing him with a lit cigarette. Of course, any leading man has a leading lady and we have a phenomenal portrayal of Ms. Travers by Emma Thompson. Emma trained, like Tom, by listening to the recording of the script read-through and practicing the way Pamela spoke. What adds up is a fantastic performance. You feel her emotion and why she is a stick-in- the-mud. This film's cinematography is spot on. It takes place over time from 1906, with vintage clothing and horse carts, to1961, with old cars and urban settings. The way they shift from time period to time period is flawless. My favorite scene is when Mrs. Travers observes the film for the first time. You see all of the emotional scarring that she has kept inside her whole life, come out. I can say that Emma's performs this amazingly well.Honestly, it's hard to pick my favorite character. Surprisingly I choose Ralph (Paul Giamatti), Mrs. Travers' chauffeur. He's the first person who Pamela likes and once you see this film you'll understand how big of an achievement that is. Paul's warm and humble performance has an affect on me that is unexplainable.The moral of the story is, don't let the past rule your present. Pamela has a hard time giving 'Mary Poppins' up and, with her sad childhood, you can see why. However, she needs to understand that it's time to let it all go.I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for 12-18 year olds. This film is little more emotionally heavy than the trailer shows. It's a lighthearted film, but sensitive kids may have difficulty with some scenes. Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews go to kidsfirst dot org.",9,0,1,28 March 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Time Has Come!
","It is surprising that only 10 to 12 hours of films created the giant franchise we know as Star Wars. People have been waiting for a good Star Wars story ever since Episode 6 came out 32 years ago. Fellow Star Wars fans, I am pleased to tell you, it has come. Everyone knows Star Wars is a sci-fi, action franchise, but this film is very unique for the fact that it goes much deeper. With Evil getting more and more powerful, there is drama and fighting between the characters, but that doesn't stop romance from sneaking in with a little bit of comedy. Granted, I was worried it would turn into a kid's comedy, but quite a few times I found my self thinking that not only are the jokes perfect, they are also not over used! Alright, let's get to the part everyone wants to read, the plot of the most hyped, but hidden film of the decade. The events start out 20 years after what took place in Episode 6, (spoiler alert for people who didn't see episode 6). The Empire has fallen, yes, but a new Evil has risen, known as The First Order. The rebellion needs new Jedi now more than ever, but Luke (Mark Hamill) is missing and they need to find (wait for it) a new hope! Is the film worth the wait? Ever since almost a year ago, people have been talking about new Star Wars episode, and it is SO worth it. Famous directors have taken on some great challenges before, including Spielberg finishing Kubrick's AI. But J.J. Abrams took on something completely out of the ball field trying to continue Star Wars. The cinematography is spectacular, the ending shot (no spoiler) is one of the greatest endings I have ever seen in a film, and the whole story itself is unexpected and very enjoyable. Although there are many aspects that are not in the original Star Wars films, I think it is actually very nice to see Star Wars not get ruined, but go through its own evolving evolution. As for the acting, of course, the original A-Team - Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and more â€“ are phenomenal and I think it was the perfect idea to bring these characters back for the pure enjoyment of long standing fans. However, it is really Daisy Ridley who steals the show. Her character, Rey, is so fresh and unique, full of emotion, and this character (still no spoilers, sorry) goes through so much drama in the film. It must have been a very hard role to play. Daisy gives it 110%. I predict she will be win an Oscar nomination for this role. The special effects obviously got better since the last Star Wars film in the early 2000s, and I still want to mention how breathtaking they are. Even for 2015, with all the CGI aliens, ships and spectacular space scenes, it is quite literally 'eye candy.' My only criticism of the film is that it is a bit too long. However, not one single scene is out of place or feels unneeded. One of my favorite scenes is when we are reunited with Hollywood's favorite space ship. Rey and Finn (John Boyega) are trying to escape The First Order. They have two options for space flight, a 'piece of junk' or another space ship. Well, the space ship gets blown up and it turns out the 'piece of junk' is the millennium falcon! Of course, everyone cheers, claps and whistles in the audience once the camera shows the breathtaking ship. It is not only enjoyable, and a bit funny, but the camera technique is perfect. If you want to know the rest of the story, go get your tickets and watch the film! This film is actually pretty mature. It isn't as kind as episodes 1, 2 and 3. It has its violence, so I recommend it for ages ten to eighteen. And, adults who saw previous Star Wars films and appreciate them will enjoy this film as well. I give it five out of five stars, because, even if it is a little bit boring in the middle, (it is 2 hours and 10 minutes long) J.J. Abrams, the cast and crew achieved the impossible and created a new masterpiece that can be proudly added to the Star Wars franchise. I am also glad to say that, for the first time in over 20 years, Star Wars returns! You can see Star Wars: The Force Awakens in theaters starting December 18th! Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!

Unbroken," The Themes of Loyalty, Determination, Perseverance and Forgiveness Make This Relevant to a Young Adult Audience
","Unbroken tells the life of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner who joined the armed forces in World War II and endured tortured until the end of the war.Although Unbroken is the third film Angelina Jolie has directed, Jolie skillfully recounts Zamperini's life. The first half weaves in and out of Zamperini's childhood and life in the Japanese prisoner- of-war camp. Some of the cinematography is gripping, such as the scene in which Zamperini and his friends encounter sharks while they're lost in the middle of an ocean. The opening shots of Zamperini's crew struggling to stay alive in their airplane immediately engage the audience. Despite the occasional frantic scenes, the movie succeeds best by focusing on its plot, which is intellectually fulfilling. There aren't any extraneous scenes and the story is straightforward. However, I didn't feel emotionally connected. I was looking forward to watching Zamperini develop relationships with his friends during the war. But, there isn't much of that. The ending, which is when the war finally ends, feels a bit rushed and didn't feel gratifying. Most of the film centers on Zamperini withstanding suffering. Although Unbroken is rated PG-13, there are several violent scenes in which the protagonist is beaten. I recommend it for ages 13 to 18. Jolie's storytelling conveys the themes clearly. Zamperini was known as a troublemaker during his childhood. Yet, he worked hard to become a great runner and eventually was good enough to enter the Olympics. After his crew's plane crashes, he manages to stay alive, even despite a brutal 47 days stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. When he's captured by the Japanese navy and is sent to a prisoner-of-war camp, he endures severe beatings. When he's presented the opportunity to live luxuriously in exchange for aiding the Japanese, he refuses. When the war ends, he forgives his World War II enemies and fulfills his dream by participating in a marathon in Japan. The themes of loyalty, determination, perseverance and forgiveness make the movie very relevant to today's society. As Lauren Hillenbrand writes in her book, Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption, 'A lifetime of glory is worth a moment of pain.'This inspiring movie is fitting for the holiday season.

Pitch Perfect," 'Pitch Perfect' Is a Perfect Blend of Comedy and Music
","Laughs is what sets this 'misfit saves the day' singing movie apart from other teen and/or singing movies. Laughs and a satiric wit ably presented by an engaging cast. KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Victoria Burns, age 14, calls it 'surprisingly really funny' and says she intends to watch it over again â€“ which is also surprising as she shares that this type of movie is not usually one that's for her.Pitch Perfect Reviewed by Victoria Burns Video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL3LAga_WzQI went to see Pitch Perfect and it is surprisingly really funny. I do not usually like musical types of movies, but this one was one of the best. At first I thought that this movie would be one of the ones with random outbreaks of song, but this movie has a nice storyline and it is funny. The singing is amazing. Plus, since the move is about an a capella group, it is interesting and kind of impressive to see the actors make the track to the music with their voices. This movie is about Beca (Anna Kendrick), a girl who wants more than anything to be a music producer but her dad makes her go to college first. Finally, her dad says that if she goes to college for a year, joins a club and really tries her best, he will let her drop out and go to California. This gives her some incentive to do well in school and join the Barden Bellas, the school's all-girl a capella group. The Bellas' arch rival is the all-boys group, the Trebles. Beca starts to fall for a member of the Trebles, Jesse (Skylar Astin), which is forbidden by the Bellas' uptight leader, Aubrey (played by Anna Camp). The Bellas are old-fashioned and Beca is tired of it so she quits, then she rejoins and makes the Bellas better than ever, new, and ready to win. Whether they win against the Trebles is a mystery that you'll have to watch to find out. I love this movie, and the characters are very eclectic to say the least. My favorite character is Fat Amy because she's hilarious and says whatever is on her mind, and it shows because she calls herself 'Fat' Amy. I absolutely love this movie and will definitely be watching it repeatedly. I give it five out of five stars because I like that the actors can sing well, and the way that they make the music track with their voices is amazing. I recommend this movie for anyone who likes music and comedy, because together it is a great combination. I like that the movie is not just about the singing and that it has a good storyline as well. I recommend this movie for ages mature 12 and up because the movie has some foul language but overall is a good movie.",9,3,7,29 October 2012
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The most intense and amazing film of the year.
","'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' is the most intense and amazing film of the year. Catching Fire is the sequel to the amazing 'Hunger Games.' This film shows how Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are, unfortunately, drawn once again to compete in a special 75th Hunger Games and how they are the reason for the rebellion in all the districts. Katniss has given people in the districts hope from her courage and that is brewing up to be a horrible thing for President Snow.What I love about this amazing film is the amazing wardrobe, hair and makeup. The incredible Trish Summerville, costume designer for the film, captures the vision perfectly in turning the book into a movie. Hair and makeup are bold and extravagant as well. I also like how well the cast works together and how well the film turns out overall. I'm a huge fan of the Hunger Games series.My favorite character is Katniss. There are lots of intriguing characters in this movie but what makes Katniss different are her incredible traits - her intelligence and her creativity are just a few. Katniss knows she needs to make alliances to stay alive and she quickly learns skills from them all. Jennifer Lawrence plays an amazing Katniss Everdeen. My favorite scene is when Katniss is on Caesar's talk show and reveals the incredible dress by spinning. The dress transforms from a pure white wedding gown to an incredible black fiery mocking jay dress with wings. It is truly stunning.This movie will make you cry and laugh. You'll just love it. I definitely cannot wait for the next one to come out. I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars. KIDS FIRST! recommends this movie for ages 12 to 18 because of some of the intense scenes of violence and gore, some suggestive attire and profanity.",10,3,26,26 November 2013
Green Book," Green Book: Powerful Portrayal Of An Inspirational Journey Promoting Courage, Activism And Always Doing What's Right
","Sometimes being alone means not being accepted. A fact that some have attempted to convey in the art of cinema, but only a few reach the precision and emotional strength of Green Book which shows not only the complex and dark social issues of the 1960s but also demonstrates the power and emotion of feeling truly alone.This movie contains a massively wide range of emotions. At times, the story is driven by love, romance and family. At other times, the characters live in racism, homophobia and segregation as it directly addresses and shows the darkness of the 60s in the United States. Yet still, the viewer will be surprised by the amount of humor and wonderfully vibrant moments that are portrayed. They will make you laugh in all the right places, without interrupting truly emotional moments.Taking place in the 1960s, Green Book follows the highly famous and incredibly successful pianist, Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), who takes great risks as an African American man touring through the highly racial deep south. Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) accompanies Shirley going from his driver to savior to eventually, his close friend. As the tour progresses, the audience goes through many parts of the south where not only racism was prevalent against African Americans and Italians, but also acknowledge the severe homophobia that existed so terribly in the 1960s.Perhaps one of the most lovable aspects of this movie can be attributed to the story itself. Every person in the film has a major character arc in which they become completely reshaped and remolded by the end. The entire cast performs with Oscar-worthy emotional portrayals of their characters. Mahershala once again delivers absolutely heart-wrenching scenes as the audience becomes acquainted with the lonesome and depressed life Don Shirley lives in, despite being unarguably talented and highly intelligent. The complexities in the set design, costume design, and overall tone of the entire world never run out of depth as the entire film feels as if it truly belongs in the 1960s, despite being shot nearly half a century later. Director Peter Farrelly may be seasoned in humoristic comedies, but makes sure his background stays separate for this film. With his lead, the audience experiences bitter reality and, with the help of cinematographer Sean Porter, view a vivid and colorful picture of United States in the 1960s, from up north in New York all the way to down south in Alabama.Cinema about musicians would be blasphemy without an impressive soundtrack to follow suit. From music considered modern and pop for that era, to classical pieces hundreds of years old, Green Book promises a highly wide and diverse soundtrack that highlights itself as one of the greatest this year. Furthermore, the music tells the story as it begins with 1960s music, but slowly goes more and more towards classical and orchestral as the story unfolds and the viewer learns more about the conflicts of pianist Don Shirley. Furthermore, despite being over two hours long, the film keeps you captivated for the entire runtime and leaves you satisfied with a natural and beautiful ending.Instead of a favorite scene, I would like to talk about several sequences present in the film. Since they're on tour, of course, Shirley and his fellow musicians in his trio are shown playing music. Yet, this varies in emotion, strength and passion as real-life events impact Don Shirley's craft just as the events impact his actual character. The power of his work never dwindles and always leaves you in awe. During the performance scenes, every aspect of the film shines with absolutely masterful cinematographic compositions that seem to isolate the musicians and truly captures the raw emotions such powerful music creates.Despite the beauty and power that hold true throughout this film, it does have things to concern parents. As previously stated, the film embraces the bitter and blunt reality of the 1960s, from homophobia to racism. This makes it most appropriate for ages 14 to 18, as well as adults. I absolutely give the film 5 out of 5 stars for its powerful portrayal of an inspirational journey that promotes courage, activism and always doing what's right in the world.Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!

Aladdin," One Of Disney's Best! Robin Williams Performance is Fantastic
","Disney has so many classics, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, but one of the greatest is Aladdin with flying carpets, magical Genies, giant talking sand monsters. Aladdin is beloved by me along with millions of others and it will be loved by many more with this new Diamond DVD. Aladdin has so many jokes that it makes you laugh, but also has quite a few dramatic scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat with relationships sprouting into wonderful romance. And, it is all wrapped together in one fantastic adventure.The story begins when a Middle Eastern princess decides she had enough of being stuck in her palace and goes out into the city for once in her life. She goes to the market and gets in a little bit of trouble, thanks to a poor young man named Aladdin. Sadly, he is accused of kidnapping the princess. Now in jail, he and another man manage to escape to go find a massive treasure and most importantly - a Genie bottle. The Genie (our favorite Robin Williams) comes out and grants Aladdin three wishes - now Aladdin can decide what he wants to do.Aladdin is such a fantastic and entertaining film. The animation is just mind blowing. How good it is, considering that it was made over 20 years ago, how full of emotion the voice actors ate, it is quite different than many other famous Disney animations. With such a famous cast, it is truly a masterpiece. And, quite nostalgic to hear Robin Williams' so recognizable voice as this is one of his most iconic roles. It really shows how he entertained the world with laughter for so many years. The soundtrack in Aladdin is incredible. Each song is catchy and kind of gets stuck in your head (I will show you the woooorld!) and so many of them are now classic songs that people of different generations sing.This special Diamond edition of Aladdin comes with quite a few bonus features. In one of my favorites, conversations with the casts, I found out a lot of interesting facts such as Scott Weinger, the voice of Aladdin, actually didn't know how to sing when he auditioned for it at the age of 15! There are also several deleted scenes, showing how different they originally planned the film and even a deleted song that was done by Jafar, (Jonathon Freeman)!My favorite scene is when Aladdin releases Genie for the first time and he quickly gets out of his small bottle (he is rather big). I love his first line, '10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck!' I love this scene because instead of ranting about something, he just does his first line as a pretty funny joke, which forever brought this lovable special character into our lives.Aladdin has something similar to the other Disney animated films in that they are meant for the whole family. So, I recommend it for ages 7 to 18. I wouldn't show it to kids younger than seven because there are a few dramatic scenes that might be frightening for then. It isn't exactly bright and fun throughout the whole film. I give it five out of five stars because this is truly a classic and I love every aspect of it, especially our wonderful Genie who we miss every day.Reviewed by Gerry O. KIDS FIRST!

Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Fantastic Animation! 3D Exceptional
","What do you get when you take a traveling circus, add in zoo animals, penguins and some lemurs? You get another hit movie from Dreamworks Animation â€“ Madagascar 3 â€“ Europe's Most Wanted. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Julianna No one, age 12, reviews the film below: Video review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ6nuOSOsMYThis movie takes off where the last film left us, with Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller), Marty (voiced by Chris Rock), Melman (voiced by David Schwimmer) and Gloria (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith) trying to get home to the Central Park Zoo. Written by Eric Darnell and Noah Baumbach and directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, this animated hit, has a great message that it passes along in this film. In my opinion, the message of this film is that the journey is often more fulfilling than getting to your destination, particularly when you are with the ones you love. Or in other words, if you are with the ones you love then it doesn't matter where you are, that place is home. The four main characters start off in Africa trying to figure out how to meet up with the penguins and get back on track in getting back to the Central Park Zoo. They end up finding the penguins, but their journey is just getting started as they head off across Europe trying to not only get home, but to not be captured by the villainous Captain Dubois (voiced by Frances McDormand). They find the perfect cover in avoiding the Captain in joining a traveling circus. The addition of the circus allows for the introduction of many new characters, one of which is my favorite character, Stefano, who is a horn blowing seal. Stefano is very nice, happy character, but admittedly is not very smart. This goofiness only adds to how cute he is. And while Stefano, may not be that smart, it's his brilliant idea that may save the circus and all his new friends who are trying to get back to their beloved zoo. One of my favorite scenes is the Afro Circus scene, where Marty tries to blend in with the circus, donning a rainbow colored wig and polka dots on his body. He performs the 'Afro Circus' song that I am sure everyone has seen in the trailers. My other favorite scene is when King Julien (voiced by Sasha Baron Cohen) meets his true love, in the form of a giant, tricycle riding bear. The animation is fantastic in this film, and while 3D doesn't always work for me, the 3D was exceptional, particularly in the climactic scenes towards the end of the movie. I recommend this film for all ages, as adults will love the humor and storyline just as much as adults will.",9,1,2,3 August 2012
Spectre," Interesting, Exciting and Intense
","Spectre is an interesting and intense movie filled with adventure and high action. It features our favorite, highly trained assassin, James Bond (Daniel Craig), also known as 007. The 00 program is being threatened to be shut down because it is believed to be obsolete and its replacement is the formation of a new world order of surveillance technology secretly headed up by the villain organization Spectre. Bond has a special mission that he can't share with anyone yet, he finds himself in bit of trouble carrying out the mission. Indirectly, this secret mission will lead him directly to the very source that is trying to dismantle the 00 program and control the world's collection and distribution data and technology.The message of this film is DO NOT let anything come in the way of you completing your mission. In the movie, there are a few who know they are not going to live to complete their mission. However, they did not let death stop them from completing it. They are able to set up a plan to have the mission completed by someone else so the job still gets done which also proves no one is an island and we all need help to accomplish our goals.My favorite scene is when James is protecting Madeline while she is sleeping and he is half awake. A rat appears in the dark. He takes out his gun and says to the rat, 'Who are you and who sent you?' He does not realize that he is talking to a rat the whole time.My favorite character is Madeline Swann (Lea Seydoux) because she's really cool. She is extremely smart, well trained and very quick. She is the perfect wing woman!I highly recommend this movie for boy's ages 14 to 18 as well as girls who like action filled movies.

Literally! And of course, once again, I love Shia LeBeouf's performance! I have been a fan of his acting for years, even before Transformers. My favorite scene is in the beginning when it shows actual footage of the moon launch because it is fascinating to see how many people were so eager to witness that back then.I love this movie so much because it has everything: Action, comedy, suspense and romance. The one thing I think is unnecessary in this movie is that every time the Decepticons are killed, they bleed. It's weird because that didn't happen in the first two films and they are machinesâ€”they can't bleed! Also, the blood looks very unrealistic so it seems pointless.This film is for ages 13 and up because there is a lot of adult humor that is very inappropriate for younger audiences. This film has a lot more violence than the first films. There are also somewhat gruesome deaths throughout the movie.Overall, I give Transformers 3 two thumbs up!!!!'

The Great Gatsby," Huge hit with our teen critics. Loved the plot, visuals, music, cast and crew.
","'The Great Gatsby' tells the story of Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), a secretive millionaire who is in love with a wealthy woman named Daisy Buchanan, played by Carey Mulligan. When Daisy's cousin, Nick Carraway, played by Tobey Maguire, moves in next to Gatsby, he doesn't hesitate to use Nick to get close to his lost love. With the publicity constantly involved in his life, Gatsby finds it hard keeping his love for Daisy hidden from her husband. When Daisy's Husband, Tom Buchanan. Played by Joel Edgerton, discovers his wife's affection for Gatsby, he is quick to make sure it doesn't last. When Jay Gatsby's past is revealed, his entire life begins to unravel. Can Gatsby and Daisy make a life for themselves or will the past control the future?I am in love with this movie! Words can't describe how incredible the entire film is, but I'll do my best. This film is in 3D, which makes the incredible set and costume design come to life. The visuals in this film could have been a movie of its own because they are so breathtakingly beautiful. The rich colors and textures make the cinematography pop. This film is set in the 20s, where life for the wealthy was lavish and over the top 24-7 and the wardrobe really shows that off. The entire look of this movie is so rich and lavish that it sucks you in and you feel as if you can grasp the fabrics and streamers of Jay Gatsby's parties because everything is so full-bodied with color. I feel like you could take a screenshot of every frame in this film and then send it off to a photography museum because it is just so striking.The soundtrack is another thing of wonder in this film. It features modern songs such as Jay-Z and Kanye West's 'No Church in the Wild' as well as Lana Del Rey's 'Young and Beautiful' and other artist such as Florence + the Machine, Beyonce, Will.Iam and even a few dubstep mixes, however all these modern hits are meshed with 20s rag time, giving it an authentic feel with a modern edge. It took me a few scenes to get used to because when I first heard modern artist Frank Ocean singing while a 20s-themed trumpet tune played, I was a little shocked. Once I warmed up to it, I fell in love with the unique sound. I actually think it is a very clever way to make the younger generation become more enthralled with the movie because the music we are used to at parties is the more modern sound. I think it is a clever way to make the festivities of this movie more appealing to a younger crowd. My favorite scene would have to be when Nick goes to one of Gatsby's massive parties. People from all over New York and from all walks of life would flock to Gatsby's house weekend after weekend to indulge in his lavish lifestyle, even though none of them knew Gatsby or had ever met him. In the very first party scene you really become engorged in the luxurious accommodations of Gatsby's palace. His house is filled with streamers, dancers, outrageously dressed guests and vivid decor. The entire scene is so visually pleasing. I also really enjoyed the scene where Gatsby plans for Daisy to visit Nick at his house and then 'coincidentally' stop by so he can see her again after 5 years. I like this scene because Gatsby always seems like such a confident man who is on top of the world but, when he is faced with seeing his true love after so many years apart, he gets the demeanor of a squeamish school boy. It is so cute how he obsesses over Daisy in the beginning of the scene and it is touching how nervous he gets before she comes over. Leonardo's acting in this scene is truly astounding and his subtle display of emotions accents the fact that he is frantically trying to conceal his emotions.My favorite character is Jay Gatsby because he is such a complex man. He builds his entire dream life to impress Daisy. He builds his home across the lake from her house so he can see her, throws parties hoping she'll attend, and does everything in his power to be near to her which is very humbling considering he could do virtually anything with his riches. Leonardo's performance in this film deserves an award because of how realistically he portrayed Gatsby. I truly respect Leonardo as an actor because no matter what role he is playing I never see it as Leo playing so and so, but I see him as the actual character. He full-heartedly embodies Jay Gatsby and shows the depths of the character in such a remarkable way. I loved every second of his performance.Overall I give this film 5 out of 5 stars, I would give it more if I could! 'The Great Gatsby' has everything I look for in a film - well executed plot, excellent visuals, unique music, and a brilliant cast and crew. I recommend this film for ages 13 and up for excessive drinking and mature situations. I can't wait to see this film again.Video review available at kidsfirst.org.",Null,3,11,10 May 2013
Warm Bodies," A Hilarious 'Zomedy!'
","When we imagine a post-apocalyptic world, it usually includes a lot of broken down buildings, stray dogs and a bunch of raggedy and tough survivors, but rarely zombies! Warm Bodies, rated PG-13, is a hilarious look at what could be, a world in which humans are uncommon and zombies roam the land looking for fresh bodies to eat.This may not sound appealing, but according to 15-year-old KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Raven Devanney, it's actually quite hilarious. And if your grandkids aren't squeamish about the idea of zombies, then you might consider this film for some mid-winter entertainment. As a quirky romance / comedy / horror film, it stands to remind us of the true meaning of humanity and the importance of staying connected with others.Go here to see Raven's full video review! http://www.you-tube.com/watch? v=iDEmy4NlziMWarm Bodies Reviewed by Raven Devanney, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 15The newest addition to the Zombie, Romance, Comedy and Horror genre. I call it, a Zombromance, or a Zomedy! It's set in a post apocalyptic world consisting of zombies, bonies and a small population of humans. When a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) meets a Human girl named Julie, he starts to feel like there is more to life than just being the walking dead. He begins to cure himself, retrain himself to talk and become more human. He inspires more zombies to try to cure themselves, and slowly they begin to become more human. Will R and Julie defy the odds and stay together, or will the fact that one of them is a zombie keep them apart?I absolutely adore this movie. I will definitely see it over and over again. When I think of zombie movies I think of nasty rotting creatures and lots of blood and gore. Naturally the zombies eat people in this movie, but it is filmed in such a way that brought a sense of humor to the whole thing and the blood was very minimal. Even the zombies don't look that bad. In fact, Nicholas Hoult makes one attractive zombie! I like the lighting and sets in this film a lot. You can definitely tell that it is a post apocalyptic world, but the zombies still try to maintain somewhat consistent routines. I thought it was cool too see zombie security guards and janitors. Although they weren't doing much, you still got the sense that there was some humanity left in them.My favorite character is R because he is such a sweetheart. He goes against his urge to eat people to save Julie and he proves that he is more than just a mindless flesh eater. Even though he is relearning how to speak, he is still quite slow so he can only mutter out simple words and phrases. Nicholas Hoult does a fantastic job keeping this character dull and Zombie-like, while still giving glimpses of his emotions and personality. This movie shows that R still has completely normal thoughts, he just can't express them, as if he is trapped in his own mind. R voiced over most of the movie and it was hilarious to hear what he was thinking, compared to what he was actually able to do. He made me laugh even in more intense situations, making him my absolute favorite character.I can't say I have a favorite scene because this whole movie is incredibly well done. I do love all the times that R and his Zombie friend M or 'Marcus' interact. They try to communicate and connect and it's so funny and touching to see their friendship show even though it's challenging for them to express it. I also really enjoy the seen when Julie (Teresa Palmer) and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton) give R a makeover. R is so reluctant to have makeup put on him, which I thought was funny because most teenage boys are. The music in this scene was particularly funny and entertaining and it is a memorable scene.I think there are so many underlying messages in this film, but the one that stands out to me most is that we need to take the time to connect with our surroundings and the people in our lives. In this film it shows a flashback to the world before the zombie outbreak, and R is saying that back then everyone could connect, but in the flashback everyone is on their phones texting or playing video games. It is a really strong reminder that we are so wired and constantly tuned into technology that we often forget to be with our family and connect with our loved onesI recommend this film for ages 13 and up because teens and even adults will love this movie, but kids under the age of 13 may find it to be too mature. I give Warm Bodies 10 out of 10 stars so go check it out at a theater near you!",8,15,32,6 February 2013
The Martian," Possibly one of the best films of this decade
","Ridley Scott turns in his finest film since Blade Runner. The Martian is such a touching film, that its flaws can be easily overlooked and forgotten. The sheer message and theme of this movie and the way they're presented is what gives this movie its greatness. It's a movie that explores the human condition and has something positive to say about it. We need that in today's cinema and I thank the cast and crew of this movie for giving us this gem. It's an experience worth having.The Martian stars Matt Damon in one of his career best performances as an astronaut who gets stuck on Mars when his teams leaves him behind, thinking he's dead after he is struck by debris in the middle of a storm. When he is able to get in touch with NASA, their higher-ups and a few other organizations, rally up to rescue him. I have to tell you that is NOT like Gravity. It is not a one-man show, though Damon does have significant screen time. There is an entire supporting ensemble that provides serviceable and strong performances. And yet, despite the acting of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Kristen Wiig, and Michael PeÃ±a, Matt Damon does steal the show. He is very committed with every character choice and really inhabits the man he's portraying. Damon doesn't layer him with underlying sadness or anxiety, instead he shows us the determination of a man who has weighed his options, and has chosen to do something about his situation. Towards the end, when he finally breaks down, it hits us harder. We get choked up seeing this person who has stayed strong for so long and then finally lets out what he's been holding back. It's a powerful thing.Secondly, the film has an amazing tone. With a soundtrack filled with Gloria Gaynor, ABBA, and David Bowie, the fun of this movie won't go understated. The soundtrack compliments the numerous comedic moments that come at a rate that could have this film labeled as a sci-fi comedy. It is funny and entertaining and will have you dancing or humming along. It's good Scott gave this movie this tone because it matches the lasting message he wants us to have - that even though the situation is bad, a combination of survival instincts and intelligence can get us through it. And, with the love and care of others, a seemingly insurmountable situation becomes surmountable. I'll tell you my favorite part. There is a moment in the movie when NASA is having trouble getting supplies to our protagonist and the issues are being broadcast. A major science organization is watching it from China, and they decide to help out NASA. There are no hard feelings, ill will, prideful rejections or rivalries going on. The Chinese organization asks for nothing in return. It is just two organization banning together for the same cause. It is beautiful and speaks volumes, especially considering the public perception of American-Chinese relations. Now there are those who may say that the tone demeans the more dramatic moments, but I disagree. The dramatic moments in this movie aren't really all that dramatic anyway. They're more like lighthearted drama if anything. There is one moment in the movie in which we abruptly and rather un-smoothly get shown the inevitable 'problem' within the film. The Debbie Downer that the protagonist must overcome to make his victory that much sweeter. I'll admit, it isn't presented in the best way, but that's not the most dramatic part of the film. That comes at the time our main character believes he's about to go home. That moment is built not by the tone of the film, but by the performance of Matt Damon.As a matter of fact, the only criticism other than the aforementioned is the pacing of the movie. It's about 10 minutes too long. There are many throwaway scenes, scenes that aren't necessary and could be done without whether because they're repetitive, or just get in the way of Scott getting to his point quicker and more effectively. The problems ensue towards the end as well, when the pacing suffers and so does the tension. It is so close to being what it should have been, but I wasn't hanging on as much as I could or should have. That's because of the moment of comedic relief that is added and the same with many of the scenes I mentioned. There are some scenes that are necessary, or helpful, but could be trimmed down.Nonetheless, the flaws are minor and able to be overlooked. The Martian is still one of the best movies of this decade. With that said, I give this movie 5 out 5 stars and, due to some surprisingly frequent language, I recommend it for ages 13 to 18.Reviewed by Willie J., KIDS FIRST!
