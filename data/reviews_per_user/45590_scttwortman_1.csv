Spartacus," The Unrestrained Kubrick
","This movie made me cry as a child,and I still choke up at the ending.I believe this was the first film I had seen where the hero did not physically triumph over the villain.As distressing as that was to me,even to my 11 year old brain I realized that the protagonist had somehow[spiritually]won out over the roman general.I often wondered how Kubrick could become such a cynic in later years[Dr. Strangelove,Clockwork Orange,Full Metal Jacket].I was not surpized in later years to discover that he and Douglas quarreled bitterly over the ending [among other things].His take on humanity is definitely not stamped on this film that he disavowed.I do believe that Kubrick restrained was a better film maker then Kubrick without limits.By the way does anyone know how Crassus ended?Well eventuallly the roman mob ran him out.He went to the eastern frontier of the empire to command a disaster of a campaign.and watched his son captured and vivisected alive before his eyes.And ended[this is a disputed version]having molten lead poured down his throat by his Parthian executioners.Makes crucifixion seem like a shot to the back of the head;doesn't it?",9,1,2,3 April 2001
