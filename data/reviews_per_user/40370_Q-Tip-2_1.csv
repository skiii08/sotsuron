The Blair Witch Project," Don't believe the hype
","While this movie may not have been the worst movie I've ever seen, it was a huge disappointment.  Having been billed as the scariest film since exorcist, I was really anticipating this flick.  I'm also a big indie movie fan, and therefor I waited in line on opening night (pre-wide release) to see it.  Damn, what a waste.  This movie is not scary, creepy, or anything resembling a horror film.  The film really begins to drag when you realize that each passing day is virtually the same as the last.  A wonderful premise, but horrible execution.  It's a shame too, a real shame.",3,0,2,17 August 1999
