The Ring," Excellent, a rare gem for horror fans.
","An English actor on his deathbed said, 'Dying is easy, comedy is hard.' I think doing good horror is much harder than comedy.  The makers of the Ring have succeeded in delivering a truly scary, well made movie.  What separates hype from substance is word of mouth and the grosses for this movie (15, 18.8, 18.5 and 16 in the first 4 weeks) show that people are telling their friends to see it.  And it is worth seeing.  Some critics have talked about plot inconsistencies and things left open.  They don't get it.  They're like country music fans listening to Bach.  It's the supernatural, it's not supposed to be explained completely and wrapped up in a neat little package like 99% of the formula crud that is shipped out of Hollywood.  It just has to stay true to itself within the four corners of the movie - and it does. Congratulations to Naomi Watts and the rest of the Ring cast and crew for pulling off a difficult task, an intriguing, well made, frightening picture that is worth seeing.  (And was as much fun seeing the second time).",10,0,0,11 November 2002
