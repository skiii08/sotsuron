Catch Me If You Can," a cat mouse chase worth watching once
","Frank Abagnale Jr was a con artist who became FBI'S most wanted man for shifting identities and forging cheques. A master of deception Frank Abagnale changed the no. at the bottom of the cheque so that the cheque which was to go to new york would go to san Francisco and by the time the deception was caught he would be off to another place. the breaking up of his family played a major role in his decent of becoming a criminal. Leonardo DiCaprio does a marvelous job in the beginning but as the movie progresses his acting falters. the movie is though enjoyable and captivating in the beginning, it loses its charm eventually and ends up as a bore. Contrary to general view,Tom Hanks has done a good job. The movie is short and sweet, humorous and emotional too at places. On the whole, it is a flick worth watching once, but only ONCE.",Null,0,2,30 March 2005
The Aviator," a cinematic excellence but a shallow plot
","the movie surly did not live up to the hype created. the movie focuses on Howard Huges life in its twenties. his love affairs, his passion for flying and last but not the least his obsessive compulsive disorder. Howard Hughes a flying pioneer dreamed of making big movies and big planes. The movie shows how he translated his dreams into reality. Unfortunately, he was a victim of OCD, a devastating mental disorder. Dicaprio has undoubtedly portrayed the sickness as if he himself was suffering from the same. His fear of dirt, the burning of clothes and washing of hands brings alive the devastation of the sickness and his eventual descent to madness. it also shows the courage with which combats the sickness to make a heavily budgeted movies and his fearless flying. Cate blanchett has done a pretty good acting but not really worthy of an Oscar.this movie marks the ascent of dicaprio from a teen to a man. its worth watching once. the movie though deserves its Oscar for cinematography but is no match with artistic excellence of Gangs Of New York",5,3,5,30 March 2005
