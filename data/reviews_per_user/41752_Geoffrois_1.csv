Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," You've got to go see that movie.
","I've just seen the premiere of Episode 1 with my friends and we all agree it was a FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE. There was action a lot, humor, lots of gadgets, vehicles, great combats. It was wonderful, and I can assure that anyone liking action, sci-fi or just great movies in general will like this one. Right at the beginning, we feel surrounded by the force and it goes on for more than 2 hours while you just can't close your eyes. Go see it, you will not regret it!",8,1,1,19 May 1999
