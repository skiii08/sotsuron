Iron Man 3," A sequel that was not predictable but for my teenager guest mixed results
","Went to see Iron Man 3 last night with my 16 year old son and nephew. Between the 3 of us, I liked the movie, my son was looking for more action and did not like the flow of the movie. My nephew said the movie was good but did not rave about it. Also, we did not walk out of the movie with any remember able one liners from the movie. What I liked the most about this movie is that for a sequel they did not just return to the same plot lines from the previous two movies. Made the movie less predictable and kept me engaged in the movie. Different moral messages were sprinkled throughout the movie. One being how Tony Stark treated people in the past turned out to be the ones that wanted to destroy him. Political messages were sprinkled throughout the movie which I can do without but were necessary for the character of the Mandarin. This movie reminded me of the 2nd Pirates of the Caribbean where a whole bunch of new characters were introduced and the film spent a lot of time developing these characters vs. action packed scenes. Much of the trailer scenes we saw were about all the action scenes of the film. We saw the Real 3D version which did not add a whole lot to the movie. The end of the film left me with two thoughts. Either this is the end of Iron Man because the actors that play Tony Stark and Pepper Potts are tired of the series or this is a twist that will be used in the plot for Avengers 2.",6,0,2,5 May 2013
Oblivion," Oblivion Trailer lived up to what I expected for Sci-Fi adventure
","Went and saw movie with my 16 year old son at Regal Cinema with RPX sound. RPX shakes us in our seats! So you know I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan cause I see him as a pretty boy image. The story started off good on what was left of Earth after nuclear war. However, the movie spent a lot of time with developing Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough characters. There was some brief nudity in this movie of Andrea's backside. Sorry in HD no matter how dark the film maker tried to make the shot still lots of detail. Somewhere around halfway through the movie I had figured out the twist in the plot of the story. To me this is where the movie should have switched gears into the twist. It did not. When the movie started putting the whole story together for the audience it seemed rushed. At one point my son thought the movie was going to end without telling the story of what really happened to Earth. The movie ran long but we did enjoy the show. Special effects awesome, sound was great and Tom did OK in the tough guy role. Good movie to go see.",7,0,0,22 April 2013
