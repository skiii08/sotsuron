The Game," Entertaining

Mystic River," A dynamite cast.
","This is a disturbing and haunting study of trauma, grief and crime. Sean Penn had an extraordinary few years around this period (between this and 'Milk', he delivered the finest performances of his career). He is supported by an amazing cast who all bring their A game.Powerful stuff.",8,0,0,22 May 2020
