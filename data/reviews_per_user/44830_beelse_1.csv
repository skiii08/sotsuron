Marie Antoinette," Crab
","The worst piece of crab, me and my wife have ever seen! The guitar pop music was terrible and didn't have anything to do with the movie or that time. Whole movie is covered with cream and pink sugar and it sickens me. The story raped history, big time!! The scenes are too long. Filming actors lying on a bed and staring out of the window or rowing a boat are just too boring to watch. The scenes repeated themselves just too darn much. And there's no guillotine after almost 2 hours of painful waiting. I just can't figure out why this kind of 'art' won Cannes award in 2006. The movie is meant to thirteen year old girls and you could make the same kind of bullshit from Paris Hilton. Do not pay for watching this!!!!",1,1,2,4 January 2009
