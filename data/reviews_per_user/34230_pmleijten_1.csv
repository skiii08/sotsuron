National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Worst movie ever
","The worst movie ever!Although I find the first episode of this movie a little entertaining, this one has to be a joke. The American bullshit that this movie contains is just way to much. The way he talks to the Paris' policemen, the end where he doesn't keep a grudge against his nemesis and tells the president (WHAT THE ..) that he didn't find the treasure alone. And another thing, that president, what a cool guy.. nothing like you retarded Americans have in real right? Don't go to this movie, if you liked it.. don't surf to this site cause, You have no idea what a good movie is!",1,9,17,16 January 2008
