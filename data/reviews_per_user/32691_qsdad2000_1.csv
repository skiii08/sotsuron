The Incredible Hulk," Unimpressed
","Before I complain, let me explain the 5 rating. If this had been the first HULK movie, it would get a 10 from me. Wonderful movie but an absolutely lousy sequel.I found the movie itself, more entertaining than the HULK character. Movie 1 featured a hulk with unlimited capabilities and he was one of a kind. I didn't like the limits placed on his growth. At one point in movie 1, the HULK appeared 10 -12 feet tall. Awesome! I'm thinking, his anger can cause his body and strength to match the demands being placed on him. It is also my opinion that the first HULK looked more hulkish. He was considerably thicker in appearance. At one point I noticed that Norton's HULK seemed flat chested.And does anyone remember the tank beating scene from Bana's HULK? Or the lab scene where HULK crawled up through that hole in the floor? Huge, impressive. This movie didn't do that HULK any justice. Didn't even to be the same HULK.Hulk 1, hands down but I'm a 40 year old man. My son's are still lying in bed talking about it. They loved it.",5,6,13,13 June 2008
