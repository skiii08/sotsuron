Source Code," A Groundbreaking Movie
","I'm not going to make the review long, because everything about this movie is just perfect (although, I would've liked it much more if the setting was the New York City).In terms of concept and story this movie is groundbreaking. It takes you to the extremes of what could be possible in the physical world. Parallel reality. This is not about time travel. It's about one and probably billions of different versions of you making different decisions in one or billions of different parallel realities, each of which impacts the world in a different way and creates a unique world. Yes, what YOU do matters!What if the world you're experiencing is nothing but what your mind processes and what if your mind and thus the world associated with it does not come to an end after death? What if you can make different choices and change your life forever? If these questions fascinate you, you don't want to miss this movie. The idea expressed here is a lot more interesting than the one in the Matrix and in that respect, I call this movie groundbreaking. It's also about true love, not love at first sight, but a love that comes along as a result of an experiment the protagonist knows nothing about. The movie kind of reminded me of the game 'Assassin's Creed'. It was just as fascinating and even more so. It doesn't revolve around special effects. It is driven by a superb story, although wherever special effects have been used, they've been handled masterfully. Trust me. This is the movie you will see and will think about long after you've watched it. The ending is very impressive! It deserves an Oscar without a doubt.10/10",10,0,1,30 July 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Could've been better
","I was watching Resident Evil: Afterlife for the 2nd time on DVD. I'd seen it a long time ago and needed to refresh my memory. I decided to read the reviews on IMDb and I noticed that most of the one-star reviews came first. They're so misleading for such a high-budget movie and probably come from rival movie directors. I agree that the fourth RE is too pretentious, hollow and a Matrix copy-cat, but none of this justifies giving it only one star, because it does have its moments; cool fight scenes, a fantastic protagonist, lots of cool mindless action, and a cliffhanger type ending. Clair wasn't bad either; especially her battle with the Monster was really awesome. I'd say it's one of the most memorable fight scenes in the franchise.The change of style in the movie is a tad hard to get used to. I'd like them to go back to the original style; no slow-motion, lots of scares and gory scenes, some suspense, which is lacking because the movie jumps from one location to another before you begin to develop a feel into the atmosphere of the location; from a futuristic base to sky, from there it cuts to snowy mountains, then quickly to some sort of desert, the beach, the sky, the plane, the prison, the ship. Maybe if they had slowed things down a little and made the duration a bit longer and had spent some time on character development, we would've got a far more enjoyable movie.What I didn't like about this movie was that there was no blood. Alice dips knives into the enemies' heads and they don't even seem to feel any pain. There's no emotional element in the movie. The survivors are as good as dead. Most of the characters are useless. You can't even connect with the villain. Nothing makes any sense. I hope they'll fix these problems in RE5, which I cannot wait to see.",7,6,11,18 April 2012
The Maze Runner," The Next Resident Evil Franchise?
","This movie was perfection in the true sense of the word. It had everything I had ever hoped to see in a movie: a great opening, a highly engaging, thrilling, mysterious, easy-to-follow, simple yet effective and to-the-point plot, likable characters you could actually care about and root for, incredible performances delivered by each and every single actor and actress, a superb conclusion and cliff-hanger ending, which calls for a sequel, awesome special effects, the kind where special effects are kept to a minimum and are not employed for the sake of special effects but for the sake of the plot, a pleasant and balanced mix of all the popular genres: Mystery, Sci-Fi and Action. There was never a dull moment in this mystery-driven movie. I enjoyed every second of it and I was hooked the moment it started. Could this be the next Resident Evil Franchise? I have very high hopes for this movie and believe that if done right, it has the potential to be one of the most successful movie franchises ever. Now I know four of 2014 movies are my most favorite: Edge of Tomorrow, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Need for Speed and The Maze Runner. Strongly recommended. Do not miss out on this one.",10,11,20,10 December 2014
Interstellar," My Personal Experience of Interstellar
","Sometimes I wonder if swimming against the tide is the right thing to do, but with this movie I am not going to hesitate in giving it a low score despite all the raving 10/10 reviews. I'll just share my personal experience with you. First off, I didn't really like the characters and my biggest problem was with the lead character. I was hoping to see Tom Cruise, because I had gotten accustomed to seeing him in two of the best sci-fi movies, i.e. Oblivion and The Edge of Tomorrow. Simply put, the lead character didn't have the looks.The country side scenes the movie began with bored me to tears. It's not a good idea to start a movie with boring country life. Most sci-fi films go well with a New York City than with a country side setting.I couldn't really connect with or care about the main characters, much less with the much discussed 'humanity' for that matter. Their performances were wooden at best. Also, Since English is a foreign language to me, I had an extremely hard time understanding what was being said. The characters were mumbling all the time and their voices were muffled by the ponderous music. The music score was terrible, unemotional and gave me a headache. I got the main dialogs though.I was literally dozing off throughout the movie. Three hours is simply not an appropriate length of time for a movie, because thanks to the technology, most people have a short attention span and quickly lose interest.What I found remarkable in Interstellar were the scenes that effectively captured the negligibility of mankind when compared to the entire universe or the seemingly endless surface of a planet. Scenes like showing a spaceship float in an endless ocean or them arguing with each other on the surface of a frozen planet were grand. In spite of this, while such scenes were jaw-dropping, they were soulless and uninteresting. Now I know making those scenes is technically difficult, but I've gotten so used to seeing more remarkable, complex and colorful special effects in Marvel superhero movies (Transformers, Iron Man, Spiderman, The Avengers, etc.) that the masterful special effects in Interstellar simply didn't deliver, and I'm saying this as an average sci-fi fan and not as a CGI expert.The plot rather kept my attention up until they said who had made the three-dimensional space, which was simply unbelievable and took the movie to the realm of nonsense. Had they said it was designed by the Ancient Roman Gods it would have been more believable than this lousy explanation. They should have stopped at 'a higher being we cannot understand' or a simple 'we do not know if it was even designed and was not simply a working of the natural laws of physics'. Not to mention the ludicrous idea that the whole 'intelligent design' to save the mankind revolves around a kid's bedroom.The movie had an emotional ending, which I liked and I think it was its strong side, but it failed to make me all emotional like Titanic. I'm fascinated by such things as wormholes, space-time, etc. and I tend to read a lot about such things and thus I expected much more from a movie that dealt with my favorite subject than just trying to explain to me what a wormhole does using a piece of paper, which instead of making me feel smart, made me feel dumb and insulted, because anyone who goes to see Interstellar should already be familiar with at least the 'basics'. What happened inside the wormhole could have been depicted in a far more imaginative way than just spiraling dust, which made it look like a cheap sci-fi flick. If the movie had a better editing and inessential parts were cut out I would've given it a higher score. If there's anything Interstellar excels at it's taking boredom to a whole new level.I give it 5/10.",5,6,11,20 March 2015
It Follows," Sex Jinn turns People into Sluts!
","Note to real readers: A moment ago this review had 3 voters, I refreshed it and it had 6 readers who 'did not find it useful' I refreshed it 2 seconds later and it had 9 readers! I totally caught you red-handed fake voters. Beware, the IMDb rating and the voters are both fake, because it takes 24 hours for your vote to register in IMDb and not 2 seconds! The proof is that not a single person found any of the one-star reviews useful out of at least 10 fake voters!When I first saw the IMDb rating I was like Wow, a 7.1 for a horror movie?! I have to see this! During the movie, I was constantly checking the time to see when exactly the 'horror' would kick in. Half an hour into the movie; nothing, 45 minutes; nothing, one hour and 25 minutes; nothing, and then the credits started to roll...The most annoying thing was the use of wide shots in each and every scene; this is the worst kind of cinematography imaginable for a horror movie. You've got to show people up-close so we can see terror on their faces, show the scary things up-close so we get scared or jump out of our seats; focus on people's faces when they're talking rather than show them from a distance as if we were watching a family movie recorded on a handy cam!There were virtually no jump scares and the theme of the movie was beyond ridiculous and even if you find it to be an interesting topic, just by reading about it, you've seen the entire movie! So people have sex and they pass onto each other some kind of curse, which causes them to see ordinary-looking (and not even scary-looking) people 'walk slowly' towards them 'from miles away' (damn wide shots!), and then they have sex with others to pass the curse onto them; basically they turn into sluts with people offering to 'help' them by having sex with them!!! I watch lots of horror movies and this has got to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen in my entire life. The acting was just terrible as well as the non-existent music-score. Watch this movie only if looking at everyday people around you scares you!Awful, awful, awful! I'm an avid horror movie fan. Do not, I repeat, do not fall for the IMDb rating like me. You will regret it later.0/10",1,88,180,13 June 2015
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Resident Evil Apocalypse Has a Lot to Offer
","I've watched Resident Evil 1 to 5 many times, and I have RE 4 and 5 in 3D. Having seen all these movies numerous times, I now have come to the realization that Resident Evil Apocalypse is my most favorite in the franchise. Granted, the first movie in a franchise is usually also the most enjoyable because it introduces us to the movie's universe. As such, the first half of Resident Evil 1 surpasses all others and can be watched many times without regret; however, while Resident Evil 1 is one of my favorite movies of all time, it fails to deliver enough thrills in its second half; and this is exactly what RE Apocalypse compensates for. Apart from that, RE Apocalypse has a great first half, because it is one thing for the T-virus to spread inside the Hive and a completely different thing for it to spread to the entire city. That being said, RE Apocalypse is thrilling and engaging from start to finish, because the universe in which the story unfolds is entirely different from the one in the original RE.Also, while we had some bland characters in RE 1, such as the medic or the first guy that is pulled in and killed by a horde of zombies, almost all of the characters in RE 2 are colorful and each of them contributes to some aspect of the movie. It also feels good to distance oneself from the claustrophobic feeling one gets in RE 1. RE Apocalypse is an action-packed horror movie that has a lot to offer. We are presented with a stronger and more agile version of Alice who can perform fascinating Kung Fu kicks and acrobatic moves, the most interesting of which, in my opinion, is where Alice is running down a vertical building. The Nemesis is a real life replica of the most feared monster from Resident Evil games. Jill Valentine is simply perfect and makes a video game character come to life. Moreover, the sense of humor helps the movie to not get boring. I remember the first time that I watched this movie, it left me wanting for more. It has a cliff-hanger ending, and you can't help but wish to know what happens to Alice next. This is very important, given the fact that many great movies let the audience down by a disappointing or predictable ending. The movie has been shot beautifully and the background music is exciting. This movie is strongly recommended to all action-horror fans right after RE 1.",9,20,27,2 April 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," What a Huge Waste of Time and Money
","As the movie started I was excited to see a character wearing a mask with glowing red eyes. I thought the opening scene was promising and then suddenly some non-serious music started to play, the main character started to dance and everything went downhill from there. After that there was special effect after special effect. I love special effects, but it did sound like this movie was made 'only' to showcase special effects such as explosions, explosions, explosions and did I forget to say explosions? The special effects were indeed magnificent, but it doesn't take long for you to realize it is all eye candy. It is there to help conceal the fact that this is a movie made for ten year old kids to gaze at and go wow. For everyone else, and by everyone else I mean adults with thinking brains, this extremely shallow and childish piece of work would be little more than a showcasing of special effects and cinematic techniques. Surprise, surprise, special effects do not make up for a shallow, childish, and extremely disjointed plot with performances that range from mediocre to downright terrible and they do not make a movie worth a mature person's time. I loved the Ghost Rider, Thor, and the Amazing Spider-Man 2. Even The Avengers was tolerable, but this one was simply a mess. Designing lots of weird looking characters with unpleasant colors and hair styles is like desperately asking the audience to love the movie just because it has some of the most weird looking characters ever seen in a movie (Men in Black anyone?). One of my biggest complaints and what really annoyed me throughout the movie is that while the special effects were great, the combination of colors in most of the scenes was really unpleasant. Remember how Thor had great colors in each and every scene? The colors actually went with one another. You don't see that here. A combination of light blue, orange, brown, grey and a lot of colors that create a really awful combination was present in nearly every scene. It was a huge letdown. Next time they should get a better art director so that they do not annoy the people who understand colors and art. In summary, this movie is not for adults. Take your kids to see it though. They will definitely love it, but since spending so much money only to entertain kids is not really justifiable, They'd better stop wasting such huge amounts of money on movies like this and spend it where it's really needed. Fighting Ebola to save the human race would be a much better use of such a huge amount of money.",1,26,56,22 November 2014
Evil Dead," Do Not Judge This Movie Based on the Original and You Might Have a Good Time
","I don't understand what all the negative reviews are for. They're all whining about why this was not the original. I'm curious to know what all the whiners would've thought of this movie if the original movie didn't exist and this was a movie in its own right. Let's just forget the past and judge this movie in its own right, shall we?Before I begin my review, I would like to point out the fact that if you get scared or expect to get scared by watching a horror movie these days, you are not even a horror movie fan, because if you were one, you would've seen so many horror movies that you'd know that there are no more original ideas left for the horror genre. You would've seen it all before and wouldn't even have such unrealistic expectations.True horror movie fans would not be scared of horror movies because they've seen it all before. I can count all the scare tactics and even the camera angles used in this movie and tell you which horror movies it has borrowed them from. Not surprisingly, it shared a lot of those techniques with 'Drag Me to Hell', which is by far the best horror movie I've seen. I have no idea what you've been watching, but what I saw was a very well-made atmospheric and highly professional horror movie , which not surprisingly, failed to scare me, like all the horror movies made these days. Like I said, as a true horror movie fan it's not something I can complain about. The shots were beautifully taken and some I would even describe as artistic, like the shots you get during the time they're traveling to the decrepit cottage. The acting was not Oscar-worthy, but then again a mediocre acting is what you get in most horror movies. I'm going to subtract one point because of that. As for the back story, you don't need to know everything about every single character to enjoy a horror movie. The least you would expect is to know why the characters are in that situation (here, in the cottage). The movie gives you just as much information as you need. After all, this is not a romance novel. This movie employed every scare tactic in the book. There is no single scene depicting unnecessary profanity here, which is sadly being employed a lot in horror movies these days, so I have a difficult time understanding why some reviewers are calling this a 'torture porn' movie. Perhaps, they need to look into the dictionary and check the meaning of the word 'porn'.As for the dialogs, this movie was weak, but there was not much the characters could talk about other than the obvious. A good dialog would've requires a rich back story, which like I said is not really necessary in a horror movie. One point taken because of that. I wouldn't really describe the final fight scenes as having a good combination of colors. An all red scenes (the raining of blood) is not exactly what I find appealing. It's irritating and redundant.I'm going to give this movie a 7, and I believe it is worth watching. There are too many stupid low-budget horror movies out there. I can tell you with absolute confidence that this is not one of them. Do not judge this movie based on the original and you might have a good time",7,1,3,31 July 2013
Clash of the Titans," Very Good for What it is
","I read a lot of bad reviews about this movie saying it had nothing to offer but CGI. Then I read a few reviews praising this and I thought they came from people who were part of the movie production team; however, after watching it I realized that a 5.8 rating does not do this movie justice. It easily deserves a 7 on IMDb. I think some aspects of the movie could be compared to Thor. Thor was definitely much more enjoyable than this. I reckon the main reason this movie is not rated as highly as Thor is that unlike Thor, the characters in this movie are rather one dimensional and you never really get to know or care about them much. The entire movie is like you're watching it from a third person perspective, which is not as engaging as it could have been had the characters been given more screen time and a richer back story. There is plenty of CGI action and grand scenes here. The CGI is passable, but it had the potential to be much better than this, considering the fact that it constitutes a major part of this movie.I would say people, who are not too critical, enjoy Greek mythology in general, have a penchant for a storyline that is straightforward and easy to follow, and of course love to see lots of action, well designed CGI creatures, fantastic vast CGI landscapes, and do not mind seeing one dimensional characters and a predictable ending and look for entertainment and pure fun rather than an intelligent plot, will definitely enjoy this movie a lot, as did I. I have to admit the monsters in this movie were some of the strangest looking and creatively designed I have seen in a long time. I am considering getting the 3D version. A movie with so much fantastic CGI is bound to look great in 3D even if I am to see it in my 40 inch 3D Sony Bravia TV and not in a theater.I recommend this movie to people who want to be highly entertained. Final verdict: 8",8,0,1,29 July 2014
Elysium," All the Things That are Wrong with Elysium
","There are quite a few things that take the joy away from Elysium. Let's start with earth. How is it that the only people on earth are Mexicans? They could have used people from many different nationalities. Given the fact that the U.S.A is a multinational nation, the depiction of Mexicans as the sole inhabitants is beyond stupid. Then we have the rich people. I'm surprised that the dominant rich people on Elysium are depicted as the French as if other nationalities didn't have rich people. Maybe that's why Elysium is an empty space paradise with no more than five residents? '2012' had done a much better job in this regard.There is also a problem with the protagonist. He is not a hero in the true sense of the word, because the only reason he's trying to go up to Elysium is to save 'his own life'. This makes it really hard to sympathize with him and it means the movie is not engaging at all. Now if he were a revolutionary who had a clear goal from the beginning (that of helping the Earth people) we could have cared a bit more about what happens to him or about how he achieves his noble goal. Having his family members killed by Elysium's rich people to make him avenge their deaths would have also made the movie a lot more interesting. If you can't care about the main character, it is much harder to care about any other characters in a movie, which is exactly what is wrong with Elysium.And what's up with the magical med beds? Such a thing can never exist. 'Face/Off' had a much more plausible scenario than that! The ending of the movie is shallow, because it suggests that a tiny space station and a few 'aid shuttles' dispatched can save the entire earth's population, or were the Mexicans in Los Angeles the only 'earth population'? This is clearly not the case, as it says right in the beginning of the movie that in the late 21st century, the earth was overpopulated. This, in effect, means that there is nothing dramatic about Max's achievement, as it can only save a few Mexicans on the U.S soil and 'not' the 'earth's population' as the movie suggests. Other people in other parts of the world may not even have access to space vehicles fast enough to get them to Elysium. In other words, this is a movie which is trying to send the message that Mexicans are illegal people who are always trespassing. Isn't this what Hollywood constantly does to people from many other nationalities? It's so offensive and unacceptable.The only thing going for Elysium is the special effects, but even that is ruined by the shaky camera. Watching a bunch of dirty, ugly people in ragged clothes and a bunch of snobs in the space is really not all that enjoyable, and with all those magic med beds, they'd better name the movie Harry Potter or Narnia. No wait, such things don't even happen in Harry Potter's magical world! Did I forget to mention the fact that the characters in the movie are not even pleasant to look at? Calling them 'ugly' doesn't quite put it. This is a bad movie with a boring story. I'm giving it a 3 but only for the special effects.",3,0,1,15 May 2014
Drag Me to Hell," I Was Actually Dragged to Hell
","I saw this movie when it was first released, but after reading the poor reviews, I decided to write one of my own. Drag Me to Hell is not only the best horror movie but also one of the best and most enjoyable movies I've ever seen. This was a pleasant surprise to horror fans like me who are sick of excessive darkness and gore. Actually, I find most such movies to be disturbing rather than scary. What's so enjoyable about seeing someone's guts hang from their stomach? Drag Me to Hell manages to scare you without using gore or dark scenes. It is the nice mixture of elements than makes it scary. The story line is smooth,there are no plot holes, the heroine is absolutely likable and innocent-looking, you are engaged with the movie and feel her torment, the background music is very creepy, there are plenty of sudden jumps and scares, there is very good use of common items and elements that makes them look terrifying, there are a few ironic moments in the film to give you a break, and the ending is totally unpredictable and leaves you in a state of shock, fear and despair. All in all, it was full of jumps and thrills throughout.What more could I possibly expect from a horror movie? It was just perfect.10/10",10,28,55,21 August 2011
Sinister," A Major Let Down
","Was the movie well-made? Yes, it absolutely was. Was it cliché? It had elements from all the ghost stories we've already seen, particularly the Grudge. Were the characters believable? Definitely. Was the movie scary? Not one bit.It's a major let down to come across such a well-made horror movie and soon realize that for some reason it fails to scare you. I think the people here who call this the best scary movie haven't seen enough scary movies, otherwise, they would've seen through the banality and repetitiveness of this one.Unfortunately, all ideas for a good horror movie seem to have been used up. Why else would you keep stumbling upon such tasteless 'horror' movies that could easily pass for comedies?The thing about horror movies is if they fail to scare you they're useless. Surely you don't want to stare into the darkness hoping that some disfigured ghost jumping onto the screen will scare you, because it's so predictable that it's almost laughable. To me, the movie, while promising, was like stale bread. Watching glue dry would've been more exciting, especially because 10 minutes into the movie I knew exactly what was going to happen, and it happened before the movie even started. It took too long for that predictable event to unfold. Contrary to what some of the reviewers here have said, if you are a 'true horror fan' you would pass this movie, because you've seen enough horror movies that this one is going to bore you to death. People who have seen no more than 10 horror movies in their life might find it interesting though.I'm giving it a four because the movie had the looks of a high-budget movie to it, and not because of the non-existent horror. As for the 'best horror movie' of the decade, I strongly recommend you to go watch 'Drag Me to Hell' 2009. Your expectations of what counts as a perfect horror movie will get so high that you will stop enjoying 'horror' movies like 'Sinister', 'Insidious', etc. in no time.",4,0,2,28 January 2013
The Descent," One of the most enjoyable horror films I've ever seen
","It seems like whether or not you enjoy a horror film is a matter of opinion. Like they say beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. There are people here who complain about the 'cheap scares' yet they fail to admit that over 90% of the 'horror' movies out there totally lack effective scare tactics even simple cheap scares. At least this movie made me jump at certain times which is a plus.The idea of a group of girls trapped in a cave which has never been explored by anyone is fantastic. Never once did I get bored watching the six girls traverse across the tight tunnels which filled up much of the time of the film. The sense of claustrophobia was beautifully conveyed to the viewers, yet another plus.There were more than enough gore and interesting brutal fight scenes. To those who complain about the plot holes. You really need to read what the director has to say then you will see that the whole film is about a conflict and an unpleasant secret which is revealed about the betrayal of the leader of the group to Sarah and it all happens in an unusual setting deep down under the ground. The way Sarah fought the ghouls reminded me of The Resident Evil and it made me enjoy the movie even more.The scene where Sarah climbs a slope covered with bones crawling towards the light was indescribably artistic and the fact that the ending leaves you in a state of shock and despair is very pleasant.Adding the survival genre to the movie makes it even more enjoyable.Overall this movie has everything I expected to see. 10/10.",10,3,7,3 September 2010
The Conjuring," There's Absolutely Nothing to Save This Movie From 'Not Being Scary One Bit'
","So after reading the reviews on IMDb I couldn't wait to see a horror movie that could actually scare me like the movies made in 2008 and 2009. I had very high expectations and I was desperately staring at the screen begging for something to send chills down my spine. Hell, I even watched it 'in an atmospheric environment' because I felt this was the kind of movie that deserved to be watched in a special manner so as to increase its 'effectiveness': I got the Full HD version, closed the doors, darkened the room, , and sat really close to the widescreen TV. I can't even begin to explain how disappointed I was when the movie finally finished. I even refused to look at the clock just so I couldn't figure when the movie was going to end. After everything was done, I stared at the screen waiting to see 'at least' some kind of surprise ending, but alas, even 'that' was lacking, and then the credits started to roll.I don't understand what made all these reviewers call this movie' the scariest movie in decades'. Perhaps these reviews come from people who are new to the horror genre? Yeah, that's probably the case. I'm sorry, but even the jump scares in this movie had not been executed properly. For a jump scare to work you've got to have the right camera angle and more importantly execute it at the time when viewers would least expect it. I almost began to regain hope when I heard some really loud crash in the house, but that's about all I got in the entire movie, and no, it's not going to save this movie from 'not being scary one bit'. The acting was surprisingly good, but when I watch a horror movie I'm not after Oscar-worthy performances. I'm after getting scared, petrified and to have the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.To the director: You want to make good horror movies? Watch 'Drag Me to Hell' and learn how to make one.",4,4,9,17 October 2013
