The Ring," **1/2 out of 5
","As you all sit there, scratching your head in wonder over who made the video and who was on the other end of that dreaded phone call, I sit here in all my slumber, merely a day after viewing this film and wonder how such a beautiful looking piece of cinematography could be so bad. This film tenders on the brink or ridiculous and seems content on explaining to us what is going on while never giving us anything to even remotely attempt to fathom what has just happened on the screen before us.  Mulholland Drive bombshell Naomi Watts stars as Rachel Keller. She is a single parent who lives in a high rise apartment and works as a journalist. When her niece faces sudden death (seen in the films prologue) Rachel fins herself out to investigate a mysterious video tape that, when watched will kill you in seven days. Rachel stumbles upon this video and after watching it runs around in a frantic panic to find out what is going on before her seven days are up. Yet after being viewed by her son and his father she is still running around in a stupor and we still have no clue what is going on. This film has some sort of hypnotic grip surrounding it that will either hold you until the very end or release you very early on, if you haven't guessed it released me. The film runs just a minute short of an hour, a time that makes it so tedious you will end up wondering when this thing will finally end more than what the heck is going on. The film was beautifully directed by Gore Verbinski who adds a certain aura of demented beauty into the repulsive images that plague the screen and rob the film of any real scares. The mixing of bright colours set upon the tone of a grey backdrop makes for a haunting images and probably the films only artful image (I am talking about a lone tree that stands atop a dying plain that slips from grey to bright red was the sun slowly glazes over it). The best part of the film by far is the video itself. Verbanski was reading heavily from the book of Lynch while he was dreaming up this video that sees pools of blood, swarms of maggots, a mirror that shifts positions, a musty old well and a women falling off the edge of a cliff. In fact Lynch's stylized weirdness pops up often in this film. In Lost Highway (Lynch's most abstract work), nothing makes sense in its pure irony. Weird things happen by never without reason or cause. Here weird things happen for the sake of having weird things happen. We see unexplained flashbacks; irrational explanations and pure amazement at how much more illogical on film can stretch itself to be. The film starts off creepy in theory, things happen that are not explained or are cause for explanation, wasn't that half the fun of The Sixth Sense? Then after seeing the video, Rachel goes on the hunt for the creator. She searches for a woman only to find she had committed suicide. She the gets caught up in a strange triangle involving horses going buck wild and then dying. She then meets and odd character who works at a horse ranch who refuses to discuss the video and finally begins her search for a little girl who may or may not be dead. The problem is that none of it interconnects for form and sort of opinion of explanation into the motivation behind neither the video nor the killings. *If you have not seen this this, this is the time to stop reading* This film left me with so many questions to situations that can't possibly have simple answers that I have to wonder why such a film would even want to evoke such questions. First who made the tape and what is its purpose? What relevance did the tape have to the dead horse rancher and the little girl? If the ring itself is the light the reflects through the opening around the stone barrier that sits on top of the well how can any light get in when the stone goes to the very edge on both sides of the well? What did mass horse genocide have to do with anything in this story? Finally if the little girl didn't want to be helped then why was Rachel led to help her? The ending of the film closes in an abrupt halt that again pays homage to Lynch but doesn't execute the technique right. Lynch can end his films like that because his stories have no beginning or ending. We open in the middle of someone's life and we close in the middle of someone's life. This film clearly established a beginning during the opening, possessed no real common ground that you could call a middle and exits without an ending. This film also never wanted to end; it had so many false endings that you almost need a spreadsheet to keep track of them. Instead of clearing up any unwanted confusion the film tries to prove itself to us by throwing in loads of new facts that only make the proceedings make even less sense. When you start your career at the very top of the heap where is there to go? That is a problem that Naomi Watts faces in this film. She is a great actress but with all the glory and pure emotion awe that was presented in Mulholland Drive it is usually not smart to follow up with a film that is of the same style but of a lesser grade. Although knowing not what this film was about I will still give you my honest thoughts on what I felt was presented. We are all reflections of what we see on television. The TV is a tool used to create false awareness and manipulate our minds into seeing ourselves in different light. I believe that Rachel was a reflection of the little girl. You will notice that almost every time we see the water we also see Rachel's reflection in it. Yet that is a contradicted thought because it is my belief that this is nothing more than an attempt to shock mainstream audience with a style only made popular in cult fashion. In all of my honest glory I must say that this film did nothing for me. It never once scared or intrigued me. I felt no emotion for these characters as they themselves had none, I really must stress that weirdness is not a good substitute for characterization and ever more so, logic. If it were up to me the cover of this film would not say `the scariest film since The Sixth Sense.' It would say `the biggest disappointment since Unbreakable.'",Null,0,1,17 March 2003
Training Day," ***** out of 5
","A mezmorizing performance from Denzel Washington as a corrupt street cop who likes to enforce street justice is alone enough to get this movie five stars. Ethan Hawke is also very good as a rookie cop who is sent out on a day on the streets with Washington, but Hawke being the good cop that he is doesn't like what he sees and gets himself even deeper than he can handel. The film suffers from a weak final act that transforms a gritty and almost brillent crime drama to a cliched action film that sets Washington up as the bad guy which he really isn't but due to the near perfect acting it isn't really a big deal. The violence is brutal in nature and graphic in content but only adds to the raw power that this movie delivers. Not to be missed.",Null,0,10,28 July 2002
Unbreakable," *** out of 5
","One can't help but feel dissapoinment from the reteaming of M. Knight Shyamalan and Bruce Willis for the follow up to the smash hit The Sixth Sense. Willis gives yet another gripping performanceas the sole survivor of a horrible train wreck. Samuel L. Jackson is also riveting as a comic book collector who has a disorder in which his bones easily break. Shyalaman creates an eerie atmosphere with his great direction and equallt good script and provides us with an intreging premise, but the story is weak and full of holes and where Sixth Sense had a delightful surprise ending the events leading up to the climax here are so confusing that viewers will be to frustrated to be suprised by the outcome of everything. Although now a total waste, Unbreakable has a hard time holding its own next to The Sixth Sense and for that will probably be seen as a huge dissapointment.",Null,0,0,6 August 2002
Fight Club," Pass
",If director David Fincher wanted us to honestly believe that we have not evolved one bit from the scum that at one point inhabited this earth than he has brillantly done it. The first problem I have with this film is that it drags on about a half an hour to long and trust me that half an hour at the end could possibly be the stuipidest ending ever. What starts off as a promising look at a bunch of low lives letting off some stream by beating the hell out of each other (mainly due to the always great Edward Norton) slowing take a nose dive into pure stupidity. This movie becomes so trashy I had to take a shower directly after watching it to feel clean again. The main problem with this film is that there is only about 15 minutes of fighting the rest is a bunch of losers running around the city destroying things and then turns into a comptly unbeliveable ghost story. The film is not a complete watse though due to several amusing scene in Which Ed Norton punches Brad Pitt in the ear and when Pitt edits images of male genitalia into childrens movies. But besides that this could very well be the worst movie I've ever seen. So unless there is absolutly no other options steer clear of this trashy mess.,1,12,39,10 July 2002
Memento," ****1/2
","'Maybe you've got an idea of what you want to do but can't remember what you just did.' These days there aren't many thrillers that have the balls to be different. With the exception of the masterpiece Mulholland Drive and The Salton Sea most thrillers are pretty standard. Mostly the story line involves a protagonist who is searching for a faceless antagonist because they have committed a crime or for other personal reasons. That said I have just described the story behind Memento. Now just hear me out because I am anything but a hypocrite. Leonard is trying to hunt down the person who raped and murdered his wife. During his investigated two people fade in and out of his mind (Teddy and Natalie) faster than he can even process. Neither of them clam to know the other but they sure seem to know a lot about each other, both are also very suspicious characters in a world where no one can be trusted. But this film has one twist that will make this film genius to some and unbearable to others. The twist is that Leonard has a 'condition' that allows him to remember everything up to the death of his wife but can't create any new memories. It is like every time Leonard opens his eyes a whole new world has been crated around him. He knows who he is but not what he has become. He knows what he is doing but not whom he is doing it for. Now you are probably wondering how a simple characteristic like short-term memory loss makes a film unbearable to some. This is where director Christopher Nolan comes into play. Nolan has decided to take a simple concept and tell it in one of the most original fashions I have seen in a film noir. He allows the entire film to unfold backwards! We open the film with a scene showing Leonard killing the man he thinks responsible for the death of his wife. We then move back in time to see how he came to the opening scene (the ending). Instead of giving the audience a situation and letting them figure out the mystery, Nolan has give us the conclusion and the basic story elements and lets the audience figure out if Leonard's actions are justified. Another interesting concept is that whenever a scene ends by meeting where the previous one started we cut to a black and white scene showing Leonard in an anonymous room, taking an anonymous phone call. He tells the caller of his days when he had to investigate a man named Sammy Jankis who suffered from the same condition as him. This is where the film gets tricky. See the black and white scenes provide a means of characterization and basic insight into what is, has and will happen to Leonard in colour. It also lets us understand Leonard's condition more thoroughly to strengthen the plot immensely with the audience even knowing. The thing that makes these scenes tricky is that while the one in colour run backwards, the black and white ones run forward in time until the finally meet at the end to provide a whole new light on everything. This is a very impressive piece of work for a first time director such as Nolan who also wrote the script. He makes everything seem visually stunning without the use of any special effects or trickery. He also creates a world where everything said and done is significant to the films outcome. If you don't pay attention to something because you think it isn't important or is boring than you may as well stop watching because everything that the eye can see is important to take in. Nolan also keeps everything thought provoking and edgy at all times. There is not one moment in this film that allows you to stop thinking and take a break. Nolan hardly gives you enough time to even blink and even the lighter scenes in the film have an eerily suspenseful ness to them. There are also some bits of dark humour thrown in but instead of being a break from the tension they only maximize it. To me this humour came off as a dead irony and just helped build onto Leonard's character. Both Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano give great performances as Teddy and Natalie but it is Guy Pearce as Leonard who gives a career making performance. Never once did he allow anyone to forget about his condition and rely simply on the story because this character is the story that he doesn't know he is telling and working in the world that he doesn't know he is living in. In fact this character is the centre of the universe in this film. Everything revolves around him. He is more than just a character; he is a reminder of reality because if you don't remember what order the scenes come in then you will not understand this film at all. What better way is there to feel like your living in a characters shoes than that? Pearce does a fabulous job of keeping everything in tact and getting off his character as likeable but still a very real person. It is nice to know that when David Lynch is gone there will still be someone who isn't afraid to make a film that doesn't merely focus on the story but more on how the audience interprets it.",Null,1,4,26 December 2002
Batman Returns," He's back
","Out of all the most popular comic boob characters (with the exception of Spawn) Batman has always been the darkest and most mature and that shows in the movies. Tim Burton is a sick and twisted man with a sick and twisted vision and there is no one who could have worked better for directing this movie better. He turns Gotham City into a nightmarish dreamscape where everything is always dark and depressing. Althought no one will top Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face in Batman Forever Dani Divito is sure to give you nightmares for weeks to come as the Penguin and Michelle Pfiffer is sleek and sexy and Catwoman. Althought the movie isn't exactly true to the comic book or the kids Saturday mourning cartoon series it brings in some great new elements like the Penguians gang of violent circus freak and a new bad guy in the form of Christopher Walken, a corrupt business man who wants to take over the city. The one big problem with this movie is that it focuses more on the Penguiens quest for domination and for most of the movie makes Gotham think he is a good guy, he even runs for mayor and they show Batman as a bad guy. Also even though Michael Keaton is not as good a Batman as Val Kilmer he has very few scenes in the film and the ones he is in he doesn't really live up to that tough guy attitude that Batman has. A warning to parents this movie is not the Batman your kids watch in cartoon form, this film is very violent and disturbing and you should take caution before letting young children watch it.",Null,0,0,5 July 2002
Ed Wood," ***** out of 5
","Director Tim Burton has weaven a film here that is nothing short of a masterpiece. Every serious film buff should see this film, as it cronicles the life of 'the worst director in history'. Johnny Depp is superb as Edward D. Wood Jr. an up and coming director whos dream is to be the next Orsen Wells and make the next Citizen Kane, just to bad everything he makes is hated my critics world wide, he is even seen as a practical joke when he hands his movie Glen or Glenda over to the people at Warner Bros. Studios. Matrin Landau plays longtime friend and once great horror movie actor Bela Lugosi who is best known for his work as Dracula, who is portrayed here in his years where he was seen as a washed up drug addict who no one cares about anymore. Next came Bride of the Atom who's name was later changed to Bride of the Monster. But the movie flopped, people were even rioting in the theater at the movies premire and Ed and his cast had to leave because they were being attacked. Og course by that time Wood was out of money, Lugosi was in a rebhabilitation center and things were looking down. But after the death of Lugosi Ed got the opertunity to make another film through the funding of a baptist church, that he promised to be a huge blockbuster and make lots of money. That film was PLan 9 From Outer Space and it is funny because even though Lugosi is billed as the top actor he only appears in footage that was shot earlier by Wood and for the rest of the movie is a body double who wasn't allowed to show his face in the movie. It's very ironic because in the theater at the premire of Plan 9 Wood said 'This is it, this is the one I'm going to be remembered for.' That statement couldn't have been more true just to bad not the way Wood wanted. See it was the one he was remembered for but he was remembered for it because it was penned one of the worst movies ever made. Burton shot the film in black and white and does a fantastic job of making the movie feel like it is actually from the days of Ed Wood. Depp is great as Wood himself but it is Landau as Lugosi who steal every scene he is in, whether it be him expressing his hate for Boris Karloff (Frankenstien) or to him shooting the final scene in Bride of the Atom where he must be attacked by a giant octopus but he has to wave they tenticles around himself because someone forgot to get the motor to run the prop. The film is often times very hilarious in seeing that Wood thought he was making brillent works and mostly only did one take for each scene and in the beginning seeing how the film crew would have to run away everytime the police came around because they were filming without a permit. The mvie also has several scenes that scream satire, like whenever Wood says he has a big star to be in his movies and he tells people it is Bela Lugosi eveything thinks he is already dead and a scene where Wood asks a crew member which dress he likes and he says well I'm colour blind I can't tell the difference but I like the dark grey one. This film is nothing short of genious and even though it will not grab the attention of everyone who sees it there is no denying Burton has carved himself yet another winner.",Null,0,0,14 August 2002
Insomnia," **** out of 5
","What happens when you have a cop with a guilty conscience, a killer who rights about his crimes, a rookie out for answers and a town where the sun never sets? You get Insomnia. We start off the film as Detective Will Dormer and his partner are flying to the town of Nightmute, Alaska to investigate a murder. But when Dormer accidentally kills his partner he covers it up, just one problem, someone seen him do it, the killer. The killer, Walter Finch, declares a partnership with Dormer, but we have to stop and ask ourselves, who really needs who? Who is really the guilty one here? Who will burn if they don't help each other? 'There are two kinds of people in Alaska, those who are born here and those trying to escape something.' A line that would almost suggest that this is little more than a dark, character driven, atmospheric thriller, but really a journey through a mans soul who must be able to find himself first before he finds the killer. I guess you can't escape your problems with out even more arising. Al Pacino gives an Oscar worthy performance as Dormer, anyone who says he has lost it in his old age better think again. He shows ever emotion right down to the last detail and does one little thing that makes him one of the finest actors around. He makes you fell the character not feel for the character, therefore the audience can be right beside him every step of the way, knowing just what Dormer is going through. Robbin Williams is also Oscar worthy as Finch, giving his best performance since Awakenings, just the sound of his voice almost sends a shiver down your spine. The film was also directed by Christopher Nolan who also directed last years Memento. Nolan seems to have no problem creating suspense, this film is very dark and edgy. But in some places it almost seems that Nolan is trying to hard to create suspense, never really giving the audience any room to breathe and sometimes, for this, the film becomes boring due to the ultra slow placing. In the end it all comes down to one question, how can you stop someone else's bloodshed why you can't even wipe the blood of your own hands?",Null,0,0,19 October 2002
Snatch," A trashy masterpeice
","This film is nothing more than a bunch of foul mouthed trash and it sure is entertaining. The story of a group of people all wanting the same thing, a diamond. It's very entertaining to watch all the different characters interact with each other as they all bumble their way around. Even though the all star cast of Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farina, it is Vinnie Jones as Bullet Tooth Tony who shines. Jones is the ultimate bad ass, I could watch this guy all day he is just amazing and hilarious. Pitt is also very funny as a boxer who is very hard to understand. There are many very funny scenes in here, one of the best is when the three black guys try to hold up Tony with fake guns. Guy Richie sure does have a knack for directing hilarious trash and he is in top form here. If you were a fan of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels this all out madness is not to be missed.",Null,1,2,15 July 2002
Blade II," *** out of 5
","I was first introduced to the characters of Blade and Whistler through a more recent Spiderman cartoon. So when a big screen rendition of the character was made I knew right away that I had to see it. It had non-stop action, just like the sequel. It had buckets of gore, just like the sequel (though not quite as extreme as one would have expected). It had a touch of witty, dark humour, just like the sequel. It ran to long, just like the sequel. It was a wild, entertaining, thrill-a-minute, roller coaster ride...this is where the comparison stops. The film starts off strong with an explosive action sequence that screams of the first Blade but then slowly looses itself it the stupidity of the story. This time around Blade must team up with his vampire enemies to take on a new breed of 'super' vampire known as Reapers. The story is so dumb and such a far cry from the original that it will have you wondering when Steven Dorff will pop up and the real story will begin, but that doesn't happen so we are left with a story that drags on and doesn't possess one lick of logic. Wesley Snipes is again ultra cool and ultra stylized as our title character (the main reason to view the film). Kris Kristofferson is also back as Whistler but the absence of Steven Dorff as Deacon Frost takes a huge toll on the final product (maybe they should have resurrected Frost, that probably would have made more sense than this). With a change in director comes a change in style. Director Guillermo Del Toro seems more worried about how big and high tech he can make everything look than providing the sheer entertainment value of the original. He also relies to much on computer generated effects during fight scenes  making the battles look more like watching a video game than an action flick at times. Don't get me wrong, Del Toror is a talented director. Some of his techniques could have worked wonders in the first film but he doesn't seem to realize that things need to be taken one step at a time and not just have everything thrown in a viewers face all at once3 and still expect them to have a good time. So in the end it was a fair attempt that is worth seeing for Snipes' super cool performance and the mind blowing intro but other than that, as a Blade fan I was expecting much more than I got.",Null,0,0,22 September 2002
The Doors," ****1/2 out of 5
","You don't need to be a Doors fan to feel the magic that this movie gives off. Whether you love him or hate him there is no denying that Oliver Stone is one of the most unique minds in cinema these days. Stone fans will love this as he stamps his trademark style all over this, there is no man who could have done this movie justice except for him. Alongside Stone's mezmorizing direction comes a script that is almost as poetic as the Doors themselves. Val Kilmer is a dead ringer for Jim Morrison. Whenever the focus is on him he is not a man playing a character we are actually looking at Jim Morrison. The film cronicles the life of Morrison from the death of his parents at a young age right up until his untimely death due to drugs, a topic that Stone doesn't touch upon lightly in this film. The desert secene is beautifuuly directed and wonderfully acted, it also feels like you are being sucked in yourself and actually living the life of this utterly twisted man. The soundtrack fuels the film with many Doors classics. The movie may run a little longer than it should and this makes some areas seem rather dry and dragged on lossing it half a star but Doors fans and Stone fans alike will rank this high one their lists as a classic to go down in history right beside the likes of Stones other works of art and even though like most Stone movies this is not for all tastes and the ones who don't like it are the ones who hated Natural Born Killers and U-Turn but for the ones who will understand it will be provided with a roller coaster ride through the live or a great muscian.",Null,1,1,18 July 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," ****1/2 out of 5
","'Welcome to Monsters Incorporated where we scare because we care.' Disney/Pixar have always been known as the kings of 3D animated features ever since Toy Story was released. But now after DreamWorks dropped a bomb on the head of 3D animation with Shrek, Pixar needed to release a creation upon the world to place themselves back atop the thrown that they helped to created, so now we have Monsters Inc., Pixar's newest brainchild. Our story is a very complex one. We are throw into the world of monsters where everything is fuelled by children's screams. We follow the lifestyle of Sully, the highest ranked scarrer and his partner. best friend Mike. This is where the story breaks off into two sections. On one side of the story there is Randall, a scheming lizard who wants to be the top scarrer. Then we have a little girl who accidentally gets released into the monster world. All hell breaks lose because monsters just so happen to be as scared of humans as we are of them but Sully befriends the child and even comes to love her. When making animated features story is key, you can have the best animation out there but without a good story you have nothing to work with. Here, as with Shrek, is a very creative and original story on a misunderstood stereotype. The film easily has the best animation from Pixar to date and the Voice work from Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Jennifer Tilly, James Coburn and Steve Buscemi as fabulous but what truly makes this film a winner is that the monsters are given human traits and live there lives like any other normal human being would. They are also given heart, which sets us up for a lesson, never judge someone by what they look like because deep down inside there is always something special to be found. Now you either would have to be dead of blind to not think that Shrek was hilarious in ever aspect of the word, the humour was enough to keep the kids entertained but also keep the adults just as interested. Well I will admit that Monsters Inc. is downright funny, often time hilarious, but most of the humour seem to be directed to a young age margin, making a lot of the jokes seem childish and fall flat at times. Not to mention these jokes and gags are shot at the viewer at such a fast rate that a lot of them are just misfires and take away from the comic value of the really good jokes, making this a little harder to stomach for the older audience. Still because the film has a heart of gold and some genuine hilarity it is sure to go down in time as a true classic.",Null,0,0,7 November 2002
Léon: The Professional," ****1/2 out of 5
","What the hell has happened here? Am I seeing things correctly or is this just a dream because this appears to be an action movie with a conscience. What amazes me is that this film seems to owe more to Shakespearian tragedy then it does to Die Hard or Lethal Weapon and has as many equal parts emotion as it does suspense. The one dimensional Jean Reno gives what could be his most effective performance as a hit man who, after witnessing the brutal murder of a young, abused girl's family takes her in. The two form an instant bond because neither of them likes the life they are living and both seem to be living it in the darkness away from society. So instead of caring for the girl he teaches her to fend for herself so that she can take revenge on the men who killed her family (it's not as inhuman as it sounds). A young Natalie Portman handles her role very maturely for her age and Gary Oldman is the highlight of the entire film in on of his most enjoyable and let's not forget watchable roles as the sadistic drug pusher who kills the girls family. Oldman is so dead on accurate that you almost have to feel a slight tingle in your spine every time he steps on screen. Director Luc Besson is no stranger to action, having directed The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita, to name a few, the man knows how to excite the senses. But what sets this apart from your typical everyday action films is that it seems just as driven to empower as it is to exhilarate. The script lets your get inside the characters and really feel where they are coming from instead of just having a bunch of things blow up. For this maybe action fans aren't ready to delve into such mature subject matter while only wanting to entertain the thought of seeing some mindless violence (don't worry there is still plenty of violence here) that they may be turned off by the dramatic intensity that bubbles at the seams of every corner the film has to offer. Some may hate it, some may love it, some may not know what to make of it and some may be confused by it But I would love to see more action films like this, films that aren't afraid to develop there characters and tell a story with meaning and compassion while still delivering one adrenaline rush after another. So love it or hate it you've got to hand it to Besson and his cast for having the balls to make something with this much integrity.",Null,0,1,20 September 2002
The Bourne Identity," Action has a new name
","Where to start off on a movie like this. Matt Damon prooves himself a worthy action star as he runs, jumps, crawls, climbes, punches, kicks and shoots his way to freedom. This could very well be the best action movie since last year when Slyvester Stallone toar up the screen in Get Carter. This movie is what u get when you take Long Kiss Goodnight and mix it with Universial Soilder and add just a bit of Misson Impossible on top with a story that is somewhat similar to that of The Replacement Killers, yes it is that good. Damon is Bounre, or at least he thinks. See he can't remember who he is or what he does but he sure does know how to kick some serious ass. His body is found in the water with two bullet holes in his back and a device in his hip with a saftey depostie box number on it. In the box he finds a bunch of fake passports, lots of money and a gun. Now the real journey begins because someone wants Bourne dead and he is on a misson to find out who he is and who he is running from. Damon and Run Lola Run star Franka Potente have perfect chemestry on the screen and Chris Cooper is perfect as the man who wants Bourne dead. This movie also has one thrill ride of a car chase in it and many great action scenes that with have your blood racing and even though it runs about two hours long it never once becomes boring or over wrote, there are even a few good one liners from Potente. This is the way action movies should be made and I hope to see Damon in many more to come because he is the perfect action movie star. If you only go to see one movie this summer do yourself a favour and make it The Bourne Identity.",Null,0,1,14 July 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," **** out of 5
","Deep down I know that the Matrix Revolutions is a good movie because it excites me to think about it. Ironic maybe because the more I think about it the more I like it. It hits us with ideas that the end is near because everything that begins must end, but in some ways it seems to breathe more life in its paradoxical conclusions than the first movie did with its cultural references. 	But it is not the best film in the trilogy because even though there is artistic poetry in the final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith, the Matrix Revolutions seems to forget its mass audience. At some point we see a transition from the self-professed philosophy of Reloaded, spawned from real philosophies and other cultural impacts, into a method in believing that we must fight for the end with our honour, our valour, and our pride. But the Wachowski Brothers get away with it because they have so much already invested in these characters that they were bound to succeed.	Yet the Matrix Revolutions is not simply a nice looking action picture. It focuses its story more on human connections in comparison to machines as Neo awakens in a place somewhere between the real world and the Matrix. After being saved by his comrades he talks to the Oracle who speaks prophecies that could be expected from a psychic at a Star Trek convention.	This lends Neo with the impression that he must venture to the machine world on his own because there he will find what the fate of human kind depends on. Far and wide between these ideas lies an immensely long action sequence with minimal cuts in relentlessness and no interwoven notions of Neo's state. 	But it still answered some of my questions. And even when it felt the need to sway from an explanation I didn't mind because the new questions left in the open were just as fascinating as the answers to the old ones. Then ending on a note of such curiosity that if a fourth film were made I would not watch it because coincidence does not merit an explanation. 	This is a film that hinted at ideas, more fully explored in graphic detail in Darren Aronofsky's cult masterpiece Pi.  In Pi, conscious decisions were made with prime material that this film didn't have room for due to mentioned action sequence of epic proportion. 	The hint in Revolutions that coincides with Pi is in that every human action is based on a code and that we need machines to be the mathematicians that our minds can't allow us to be. That film was kind of an elaborate set up for a look into a man's limit to his own sanity. This one speaks in tongues that show the better part of a grade eleven math course finally doing itself some good. 	The belief stems to say that every equation has equal opposition between worlds. In a mathematical sense, the figures that exist on both sides of the equal sign (parallel worlds) are, in turn, the same information, only presented in different forms. For example the number three could be opposed as being six divided by two in another universe making it the same power in a different identity. 	That's where the Matrix comes in. It was a system designed to balance the equations. The Architect, we learned in Reloaded, was a mathematician, who, in creating this vast program could balance the equations and hold the power of humanity in his hands, because those who hold the answer hold the understanding. In this film we find his equal opposition. That one whose attempts to unbalance the equations effect a chain reaction of unbalance between bi-polar opposites Neo and Smith. 	In Reloaded we were thrown a bunch of psychobabble about how Neo and Smith were one in the same. This is true in Revolutions as we find the only way to balance an equation is to make both sides of equal proportion, leading up to that final battle sequence, which may make sense of, or complicate matters even worse. 	That's what I would have liked to see more of in Revolutions. Although, it is a smarter film than critics are giving it credit for. And it doesn't surprise me. When something is given such mass appeal it is easy to become immobile to hate for no better reason than to be the one saying something different. 	 Unlike the first two films, with Revolutions it comes down to a war between parallels that are acted out instead of further exploring reasons. I was looking for more curiosity in the methods behind the action, but such is not the case. All ideas seemed second to the endless shooting inside the Bay of Zion. But to a certain advantage point I was still content that this was a good film because we are receiving no more than what was avoided but pushed toward during Reloaded; a special effects extravaganza.	And an extravaganza it was. The person next to me in the theatre could only utter two words as the Sentinels swarmed into Zion, the first being `holy...' With that, there is no doubt in my mind that it will be years before the effects in this film will even be comprehensible to all the other special effects driven films to follow. 	I know that I have neglected to examine much of the story and characters of Revolutions but in all honesty it would be impossible to have someone follow anything that happens in this film without prior knowledge to the first two. I think of this as more a theoretical analysis rather than an opinionated view, because there is much more to be explained and discovered in the questions I was left with than in the actual technique of the filmmaking.	 I'm reluctant to say that Revolutions is the worst film in the trilogy, simply because it was more entertainment than thought. But I still have my impressions that this series is not the culture-shock phenomenon that many claimed it to be. During the bonus features of the DVD for Reloaded I heard someone say in an interview that this could be the most complex movie ever made. I highly doubt that, but it could very well be the smartest and nicest looking action movie of its time.",Null,0,0,11 November 2003
Pitch Black," ***1/2 out of 5
","This is a brilliant science fiction film that got the treatment of no more than a modern day Alien rip-off. There is actually three films going on at once here, one is a story about a ship that crashes on a deserted planet and its crew must find a way to get off of it. Second is about an escaped convict named Riddick that the crew is searching for before he can kill them all and finally, the third is about a bunch of aliens who are prone to light, but just as luck would have it the crew decided to crash on the planet just at the time of a solar eclipse, rendering the entire planet in darkness. If this film were to stick with the second story then we may have had a classic on our hands but it decides to throw all three together and branches off in some many different directions that it is hard to pinpoint one set story pattern. The first half of the film is superb because it bases itself upon the unknown, we don't know what caused the ship to crash, we don't know why the planet is deserted, we don't know who or what Riddick is and we don't know anything about the alien that inhabit the planet. But that is a problem by the end of the film we still don't know anything about the aliens and I was even questioning why they were even there in the first place, they served no purpose at all and instead of adding to the story they only raised the body count. So after the first half of the film the impact of the film goes way down and it turns into nothing more but a bunch of sci-fi cliches and bloodshed while everyone walks around in a tense position fearing who will be the first to go if Riddick decides to snap. This film was what really put Vin Diesel into the picture and made him a household name and even though he now stars in huge action blockbusters it is nice to see him play the more atmospheric, character driven roles like that of Riddick. It was a smart move casting Diesel as Riddick because the film, as far as I can tell is basically all about him and Diesel easily outshines the whole cast and is the only one to produce any suspense and humour for most of the film. To science fiction fans what I am saying has more than likely already flown right over your head and you are probably drowning in a pool of your own drool by now, to everyone else this is just a retread of what you have already seen hundreds of times before just a lot less scary, but I do recommend this film because of the eye-popping special effect, a great performance from Vin Diesel and a highly entertaining first half.",Null,0,0,2 November 2002
American Beauty," ****1/2 out of 5
","This dark comdey focuses in on the day in the life of a disfunctional family and the actions that take place around them. The movie one several oscars including best picture and best actor for the well disserved Kevin Spacey. Spacey is priceless as a father and husband who is getting fed up with his family who include his cheating wife (Anette Benning) and his troubled daughter (Thora Birch). He is also falling for his daughters best friend (Mena Suvari) and is becoming friends with the son of their neighbour who is also attracted to his daughter, trust me it's not as confusing as it sounds. Birch and Suvari handel thier mature roles very good and you can also see Peter Gallager as Bennings boss/secret lover. The movie is often funny and other times dark and beautiful. Although I don't believe that it was the best movie of the year it does rank high on that list and will be a treat for all fans looking for something a little more offbeat that normal.",Null,0,0,7 August 2002
Save the Last Dance," **1/2 out of 5
","Saying that this film is a musical would be like saying Fight Club was a kung fu flick. When this film first hit the street I didn't think there would be anyway that it could be taken seriously. But it became a huge surprise hit and raked in big bucks at the box office. So now, years after its release I decided to see what all the fuss was about, I didn't find much. We open the film with a truly heart-breaking scene of Sara riding on a train while she flashes back to her mom's death when driving to her ballet addition. This scene hit me hard. It was very sad but yet had a sense of reality in it that couldn't be ignored. The rest was downhill from there. Sara then moves in with her dad. He lives in a run down neighbourhood full of sex, drugs and violence. I guess you could say it came from a scene right out of Boyz N' the Hood (easily the most powerful blacksplotion film ever made). This helps to unfold the rest of the film. If you think I have short changed you on the plot description I will certainly agree that I have. You may be interested in what happens to here once she moves, what kind of troubles does she meet up with along the way and mostly what does any of this have to do with dancing? I would love to answer all those questions in this review but that would be impossible. You see after that opening scene this film takes so many different turns and plot twists that it is almost impossible to follow and even harder to care about. There is something new presented in every scene and dropped just a quickly in the next. I criticized 8 Mile for doing this as well but the difference is that 8 Mile stayed to one basic story, it just didn't developed anything within the context of that story to be interesting. This film jumps all over the place and instead of having one solid message it tries to preach about to many different things. We hear about the bad relationship between a father, the shattered dreams, the blaming of ones self for the death of a loved one, teen parenting, reaching out to achieve your goals, not caring about what other people think about you, racial barriers and a message about gang violence. Still wondering what all this has to do with dancing? The answer is nothing. The dancing is only thrown in as a way to disguise the fact that this film never had a clue where it is going and has even less of one about where it will end up. Filmmakers knew this film was geared toward teenagers so it seems like all they are doing is throwing a story about dancing to cover up the fact that this film does not flow together at all. The best example is when Sara first sees Derek she thinks he is a complete jerk. The next time we see the two on screen together they have instantly fallen in love with each other. We are given no explanation as to their feeling for each other or how they grew to be this way, it just simple happened. Almost all the other subject matter presented follows this same pattern. But the film does work in talking about the racial barriers between blacks and whites. Even though the love story between Sara and Derek didn't do a thing for the film it was nice to see that it wasn't looked on as a conventional relationship and that a lot of people do look down on these types of things. Also the messages about violence and knowing when to walk away were very effective for me, the problem is that they weren't dealt upon enough or didn't fit into the story. If films makers wanted to make a film about violence they should have made one about violence and stick to that. There are so many things going on in here I found myself more interesting in what was going on in the world around them than the actual characters themselves. In fact I didn't feel for any characters in this film at all. Watching the characters in this film is like watching a horror film like the Candayman and seeing that very same hook handed killer in a slapstick comedy. Different characters are needed to suit different environments but. Sara and Derek always seem to be at the heart of everything that is going on. Their moods never change with the flow of the film. It seemed that whenever they would have a romantic moment the film would instantly switch into suspense mode but the audience is still left with the feeling of romance. Don't get me wrong, the acting is not bad. Julia Stiles is a very talented young actress who I can see big things for in the future. He holds this whole film together because she allows her emotions to change freely from scene to scene and is able to show all the pain she is going through but also allows us to get into the lighter side of her life. Sean Patrick Thomas on the other had is not suited for this role. The whole time I was watching him I could only think of how much this film could have benefited if that part was given to someone like Mekhi Phifer. Hey if he could keep 8 Mile from falling apart I'm sure he could do the same for this film. Another thing that bothers me about this film is its tag line ' The Only Person You Need To Be Is Yourself.' Nowhere in the film is that presented at all. Sara goes into her new environment as a smart intelligent type. She then conforms to the ways of her black friends in order for her to be accepted. The character we see at the start of this film is not the same one we see at the end and that bothered me, especially considering all the film trailers depicted a girl having to face her past in order to become her present. Maybe that is talked about in the film, and maybe teen girls will be able to buy into that. But after seeing plot hole after plot hole I found that message nowhere within the film (I guess whoever was in charge of marketing did a good job, it must have been the same people who did it for 8 Mile). I am yet again going to compare this film to 8 Mile because I feel both are sending out terrible messages. Both seem to be saying that in order to be excepted by the public you have to be someone/something that you aren't. This is most notable in the last scene (the dance audition) but I am not going to give the ending away so you're going to have to figure that one out yourself. It is nice to see that MTV is trying to say something with the films they put out. I don't know about anyone else but I didn't find any deep, life changing messages in Joe's Apartment or Dead Man on Campus, but they are going about it totally wrong. They have tried to put a message from a film like Boyz... into a film that will be marketable to teens. Maybe if MTV were more worried about what is being into the film and not how they will sell it we may have had a winner on our hands, but because of its candy coated theories and watered down statements it doesn't come close to hitting the mark.",Null,1,2,2 January 2003
Spider-Man," ***** out of 5
","Move over Batman because there is a new hero in town and he is taking over. Finally after years of legal problems fans have been graced with a Spider-Man film and it was worth every minute of the wait. Peter Parker is blessed with the strength and sense of a spider after he is bitten by one on a school science trip. After discovering his powers he turns to professional wrestling for money but decides to use his powers to rid the city of crime after his uncle is killed by a car jacker who he could have stopped but instead let his ignorance get the best of him and let the thug get away. Sam Raimi has always been known for taking his films one step above everything else out there, not only making him perfect for this film but also making him on of the more talented directors these days. Raimi makes everything so big and beyond belief that the film is overwhelming from start to finish, never once loosing the attention of the audience even thought it runs over two hours long. You would also think that a film which uses mostly animated characters would be awkward and hard to take seriously, like in Blade 2, but it is done so well here that I had a hard time determining what was real and what was animated. The action sequences are huge and terribly enjoyable, Raimi's direction is so good that you will actually feel like you are soaring high above the city right behind Spider-Man and even thought these sequences move at a extremely fast pace, Raimi never lets the audience get lost in the excitement, unlike the terrible Rollerball everything is very easy to follow, making the end result dazzling to watch. The script is also very good in that it keeps everything you know and love about your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man but also can poke fun at itself, it almost raises itself to a point of satire when everyone is saying what they feel about Spider-Man and even includes that old rescue the baby from a burning building cliche, but is used with such style that you don't say 'how cliche' you say 'welcome back Spider-Man.' Now I have never been a fan of Toby Maguire but it almost seems like he was born to play Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst is at the top of her game as Marry-Jane, the sexual chemistry between the two just pours from the screen making this not only an exciting action flick, a great comic book remake, a suspenseful adventure but also a heart tugging romance as well. Let's not forget William Dafoe who is delightfully over-the-top as the Green Goblin. You can also look for cameos from pro wrestler Macho Man Randie Savage, Macey Grey. Raimi regular Bruce Campbell and if you look close enough you may just catch a glimpse of Spider-Man creator Stan Lee outside of Oscorp after it is attacked by Green Goblin. Ten years ago when Tim Burton (who draws many influences from Raimi) created Batman for the big screen he relied mainly on atmosphere and character rather and action making it great for fans of the Batman comics but being totally inappropriate for the younger audience who watched the Batman cartoons. Raimi also uses atmosphere (the entire film feels just like you are looking at a comic book and try not to picture Evil Dead while watching some of the more intense scenes) but he also kept in mind the younger audience who grew up watching the cartoons (myself included) and although it is probably to violent for the younger children, older kids and grown-ups alike can take a trip down memory lane while being thrust to the edge of your seat and marvel as the magical special effects unfold before your eyes. Sam Raimi has always been a honest filmmaker and even thought this film became a huge summer blockbuster, Raimi never set out to make a film just to rake in big bucks, he made a film for the fans that the fans will love, you can feel it in his direction, you can see it on the faces and hear it in the voices of all the actors involved. I can't wait until the next Spider-Man film comes out because if it is anything like this one it will be well worth my time.",Null,0,0,1 November 2002
The Exorcist," ****1/2 out of 5
","You cannot call yourself a true horror advocate until you have treated your eyes to a viewing of the Exorcist. Forget the terrible sequels and the unending stream of knock-offs this is the mother of all horror films, not only because of its mass effectiveness, but because it is one of the few horror films that could make good use out of religious content. The story starts out in Iraq on an archaeological dig site where an elderly priest finds an ancient artefact of some sort, we never really find out what it is but there is no question that it injects fear into the veins of its finder. Now we travel back to America where our film is divided into two parts. One is about a priest who is plagued with guilt over the death of his mother. The second is about an actress and her twelve year old daughter who becomes sick. The little girl is believed to have come with a mental disorder but all the doctors tests reveal that there is nothing wrong. We later find out that really the girl is possessed by a foul mouthed demon who spews forth enough perversions to make even the strongest willed feminist go into shock (whether it is Satan himself or not is really up in the air), so her mother enlists in the help of two priests (one being that of the above mentioned) to perform an exorcism on the girl. This film has been pegged as being the scariest movie ever made. I will admit that this is just as much a classic now as it was when it first came out, but scary it is not, haunting yes, but scary no. In actuality this film needs not be scary, that is half the fun. Nothing jumps out of the dark and there is not creepy music blaring in the background, there is just a dark atmosphere that sucks you in and eats at the back of your head like a termite in a lumber yard. I think that the cold breathe that comes from the mouths of all who enter the girls room is more effective than the moving furniture and the projectile vomit, although that does add to the overall effect. The one problem I have with this film is that aside from the haunting nature and the great acting there is very little logic and understanding in the events that happen, little to nothing is explained and almost every scene seems like it has been cut short, some scenes even seem to be put in there for no reason. Other than that this is the horror film of all horror films that have been made in the past, present and furture and easily ranks itself as one of the best in my books any day. It is always nice to see a film done with style and originality in a genre that is usually known for its amateur filming and usually laughable acting.",Null,1,2,6 November 2002

","Edward Norton gives a powerhouse of a perfomance in this tense drama about race. Norton is a top member of a nazi gang who is sent to jail for three years for killing two black men tring to break into his house (one of the most powerfull moments shown in gripping black and white flashbacks). While in jail he befriends a black man, is raped in the shower and has his life comptly turned around by the time he is realeased. But upon arrival back home he sees that his little brother, played by Edward Furlong is going down that very same path and must save him before it is to late. Norton ignites the screen in his best performance to date. He gives ever line with power and emotion and Furlong is not far behind him. This film also contains one of the most powerful endings I have ever seen. It left me totally speechless. Although there sexual content is high and the profanity is never ending this movie will make you think twice about the society we live in. This movie is not for entertainment purposes and should be watched seriously so for anyone looking for a good thinkers movie this one is not to be missed.",10,0,0,11 July 2002

","After movies like Super Mario Bros, Double Dragon and Tomb Raider showed that it is not easy to convert video games to the big screen this movie comes along and prooves that even more true. Great special effects can't save this mixed bag of action, horro and sci-fi that is neither exciting, scarey nor innovative. The film slightly succeeds on a 'kick ass' level due to a nice performance from Michelle Rodriguez, but everyone else seems somewhat miscast. A weak story and even weaker execution make the film often confusing and it seems like the filmmakers expected everyone seeing this movie to have already played the game. This film probably wouldn't have even survived the first weeks at the box office without its namesake but because the game is so popular and the end setting itself up for this, I am sad to report that there will more than likely be a sequal. I just hope they get it right the second time around.",Null,0,1,6 August 2002
The Transporter," ** out of 5
","Action is in a sad state of self-loathing these days. This is a genre that used to be about macho, adrenaline soaked fun. Now it seems to have been de-revolutionized into a contest to see who can hawk as many recycled ideas into their film. Now anyone who has been subjected to my flow of thoughts in the past will know that I am fully in favour of Luc Besson and his movement to bring integrity to action films that combines the big thrills with the tender art of French theatre. I guess that is why it was such a shame to see a film like this fail horribly at ever turn. This is the story of Frank, a transporter who helped criminals escape the police and also transports packages, no questions asked. He is good at his job, probably the best in the business. He lives by his rules and will die by his rules: number one, never change the deal. Number two, no names, and number three, never look in the package. It is rare to see that an action persona follows such a strict set of guidelines. He asks customers the weight and exact dimensions of their packages and maps out an exact time of deliver, but is a fresh and welcome change to the fold. Who ever said an action man can't be a perfectionist? But rules are meant to be broken, any individual with an active conscience knows that, and when they are broken there is usually little repercussion to accompany the crime. So what should happen if a man who puts his life on the line for his rules decides to break them one sunny afternoon? All hell breaks loose. After having to pull his car over to change a flat tire, Frank finds that the bag in his trunk seems to be alive. So being the gentleman he is, he buys whatever it is a drink. The bag turns out to conceal a young Asian girl who is bound and gagged. Of course with any standard action fare the villains find out about Frank's abundance of disclosed information, making him for death. One of this films major pitfalls is that it makes its central character extremely hard to like and except as someone with heroic traits. Frank is not a good guy nor is he a bad guy. He is a businessman who will do whatever it takes to get the job done and cares only for the payoff he receives from a mission accomplished. Unlike James Bond or Xander Cage for that mater he cares none for the people he deals with and the troubles they face. So when he decides to care for, possibly even love, this Asian girl and risk his life for hers it is hard to give heed to either party. I guess Besson himself is to blame for that, he produced and co-wrote the script to this film. But it is the direction from Corey Yuen that does this film the injustice that it is. Between trying to be as action packed as possible and as artistic as possible Yuen lands right in the centre with nothing with any meaning behind it or any thrills to aid it, to put it bluntly this film is just plain boring. The thing that made Besson's action masterpieces so splendid was that before divulging in action he made sure to have a full cast of characters and a story to back the needs of all supporting to the product. Besson supported his men with anything they needed to bring out the best in their character and in return they delivered him with fully emotive and humanly characteristic people. Here Yuen gives his men very little and they return the favour. Frank seems to walk in and out of action sequences like he has nothing better on his agenda to pertain to and the stories villain(s) are more annoying than threatening. With any Besson film there is a sensual romantic bond between the lead male and lead female. There is no exception here except the fact that it is entirely irrelevant. In one scene they don't care for each other, in the next they make love and in the next they never act upon it again. These feelings are not even made clear to the viewer in the end. The script also feels it priority to through in tremendous plot twists without explanation of given time to be exercised. If there is one pet peeve I have about action it is the whole `trust no one' scenario, especially when the director gives no time to explain of elaborate on any reason for this to be happening. Being as this is an action film there is undoubtedly going to be a mass amount of cliches. I will only touch on two of the worst offenders because I see them in almost ever film of this nature and am getting sick of them. The first one is the `untactful detainment.' This is where a henchman has the hero detained, usually in a headlock, and he still manages to take down all of the oncoming baddies. What is the point of putting a guy in a headlock if he is still able to beat up your men? The second cliche that gives me great discouragement to see is the `vehicular misconduct.' This is when a fight break lose in a vehicle, usually a transport truck, at top speeds on a highway.  You all know what I am talking about that scene where the two rivals try to fight and steer at the same time and one usually finds themselves hanging out of an open door or kicked out a windshield. This is one of the most recycled action sequences out there and trust me, it does not get better with time. I do not know who scored this film but whoever it was should maybe consider resigning from the action field and entering into low-grade porn. That's right there is porno music playing during one of the film's more intense action sequences, not only ruining the momentum and structure of the scene but also sacrificing any enjoyment from the scene. This is a very kaleidoscopic film. It is a wide array of shifting fragments and colours to come up with something new around every turn. It is truly a film of great potential with the talent, on and off screen to make for a great action/art film in the same vein as La Femme Nikita but falls flat on its face from what I like to call `XXX syndrome.' Meaning it features enough action to deliver the thrills but has such a mish-mash of a story that it is almost made impossible to like, and in this day and age of low rent film making, story is key.",Null,0,0,26 April 2003
The Elephant Man," ****1/2 out of 5
","As painter one must devistate yet captivate an audience so that even though people walk away not knowing what to think they still want to come back for more. Maybe it is this fact that David Lynch has been able to breach a gap between his paintings and his films, or maybe that is why he, in my eyes, is not a director at all, but more of a captor of emotion that gives meaning even to the unexplained. For this I have come to believe he is one of the smartest men in film and also for this I also believe he is one of the greatest misunderstood talents we have. Lynch doesn't let anyone off easy in this tale so devistating that it is, at times, almost unbearable to watch but still we can't help but find ourselves staring with wide-eyed fasination at what will happen next, the movie is kind of like driving by a fatal car accident, you know that what you will see is probably wrong but you can't help but look anyway. From birth John Merrik had been a terribly deformed human being. We see him humiliated in public as a side show freak, we see him beaten and we see him treated like an animal. But still underneath all this misunderstanding lies a soul so kind, so gentel and so innocent that you can't help but feel your heart turn in knots everytime he speaks. Merrik is then taken in for examination and is befriended by Dr. Treves who helps to expose John as a human and not some freak of nature. John Hurt is absolutly magical in an Oscar worthy performance as Merrik and Anthony Hopkins is a joy to watch, as always, as Treves. Where a lot of films today like Simon Birch, Life as a House, I am Sam and the Mighty are just sad for the sake of being sad, Lynch's characters are so human that you can't help but feel their pain. Lynch also shows us that even people who don't look the same as everyone else are just as entitled to be called human as you or I. It also shows that sometimes we are so blinded by pride or greed that it is really we who are the animals that we peg people like John of being. It sure is hard to fins a film in this day and age that is this honest and even though it horrified me at how cruel we can be I must give Lynch credit for being so brutally truthful in a genre that has become so candy coated and sappy it is almost sickening. A word of advice, don't forget the tissues, you will need them.",Null,1,2,15 September 2002
Dog Day Afternoon," **** out of 5
","If the idea of an entire two hour movie being solely based on a single bank robbery sound boring than I would have agreed with you. But Dog Day Afternoon is extremely intriguing, why you may ask. Well the simple fact of it is that this film is more than just two hours of footage from inside a bank. First we have the media. We see how the bloodthirsty media will do anything to get their story and will feed the public as much information as they can get their dirty hands on no matter how relevant it is to the situation. We also see that the media seem more content on making heroes out of these criminals than covering the actual story, you think it's unbelievable just look at Charles Manson, this is justified in the film just by hearing the crowds reaction every time one of the robbers steps outside. Then we deal with family, love, identity and homosexuality, that sure is a lot for a bank robbing flick isn't it? To actually enjoy this film you have to dig a littler deeper, scratch a little harder and listen a little clearer to pick up on what is really going on, if not you will probably be experiencing the most boring two hours of your life. Al Pacino is fabulous, as always, as Sonny, the man who is robbing a bank so that he can pay for his lovers sex change operation. But he sees himself struggling not only to find his way out of the mess he is in but to find himself as a man and try to justify his actions. Pacino gets so deep into his character that the suspense created by the film has a very natural feel to it, not to mention that this was also based on a true story and it is very hard to make an audience believe that this has actually happened but Pacino does it beautifully. In the end we see that life is only as hard as you make it, as complex as you make it and as complicated as you make it, to use others as an outlet for you frustration will only dig yourself a deeper grave than you have already made for yourself. I highly recommend this film if not for the message beneath the surface than just for the overall impact the film has.",Null,0,0,6 October 2002
Mulholland Drive," ***** out of 5
","'It will be just like in the movies, we'll pretend to be someone else.' After taking a frienly stroll down the Lost highway make sure to turn off onto Mulholland Drive, one single street that could fuel all of your greatest nightmares, if it even exists at all. Sometimes you have to scratch your head and wonder where director David Lynch was trying to fo with Blue Velvet and Lost Highway, well wherever it was her is finally there. Few directors posess their own sense of identity, but Lynch is one that does. If you are familliar with his work you don't come out of his movies saying 'that was weird' you come out of his movies saying 'that was Lynch.' The actors in his movies get into their characters so deeply that they could probably tell the story without muttering a single word. But no matter how many characters Lynch packs into his script or how well he develops them, it is not about the characters, it is about the surreal universe they exist in and the wide spectrum of possibility they are given, which is not possible without the brillant touch from our man of the hour, David Lynch. Roger Ebert said he doesn't reccomend this film to anyone who requires logic, leading people to believe that there is none present. But I must say I feel exactly the opposite, Lynch's mezmorizing script possesses so much logic that trying to pick it apart would be like trying to cut cement with a plastic butter knife. What we have here is the complex story of Betty and Rita, a broke diretor and a mysterious cowboy. Betty is an innocent looking blong who wants to become a big star, Rita is a sultry brunette who can't remember who she is after escaping assassination due to a violent car crash on Mulholland Drive. We also have a director who just got fired, found his wife in bed with another man and is flat out broke. But things begin to change for him after a cowboy tells him to cast Betty as the lead role in his new movie. Betty and Rita also begin a lesbian love affair, as the memories slowly come back and we slowly slip into a bottomless pit of weirdness. The ending is typical as you won't have a clue to what has happened but unlike Lost Highway, with close enough inspection this one canbe figured out. For everyone who saw Vanillia Sky and wondered what it would be like to not be able to tell the difference between a dream and reality should watch a Lynch film, you will probably need someone to pinch you to make sure that you haven't slipped away into your own private dreamscape and really when it comes down to it that's what it's all about, dreams. First we question the destiny of these girls, then we question the fate of these girls, then finally we question the existiance of these girls. The film was pegged as an erotic thriller and where most films today with that lable fail to capture erotism or thrills, Lynch does both to perfection with his weird and obscure method of camera work and offbeat lighting he manages to send more than a few chills down your spine and the love scene between Betty and Rita is so hot I had to stop and wipe the steam off my TV screen. Although the film is less dark than Blue Velvetand less disturbing than Lost HIghway it meets both films right in the middle of the spectrun to make for the best of the three. Lynch got an Oscar nomination for his astounding direction and the film made many a critic's top ten lists and in some cases was even said to be the best film of the year. With that much hype can the film really live up to what it promises? The answer is yes, not only does it live up to the hype it exceeds it, excelling itself right up the latter of perfection.",Null,0,1,31 August 2002
Caddyshack," **** out of 5
","Amusing and often times very funny story is set around a golf course with a bunch of untimly characters and gags this one is certainly a classic. It features Chevey Chase as an absant minded golf pro, Bill Murray as a perverse greens keeper, Rodney Dangerfield as a rich wise cracking golf and the cutest dancing goffer you will ever see. All three leads are at the top of their game and couldn't be much more funny. There really isn't much of a story here it is pretty much just the viewer follwing around all the different characters and watching their wacky actions unfold. This movie is contains many laugh out loud situations due to our three great leads and even though some of the jokes may miss the target once in a while the film makers keep them coming at a steady pace so that the viewer never gets bored. This is the way comedy should be made these days with movies today featuring sex with pies, loads of fart jokes and stupid caracters that we don't really care about this movie, although over 20 years old is a breath of fresh air.",Null,3,4,22 July 2002
The Evil Dead," ***** out of five
","This ultra low budget quicky could very well be the best horror movie ever made. This is the first and best of the trioly that was followed by Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn and the fantasy/comedy Army of Darkness. Where Evil Dead 2 took a more comedic aproch this movie is a little more horror and a little less slapstick. Sam Ramai gives the viewer a lot from very little, Ramai has always been known for taking his films one step above anything out there at the time and he does just that here. The special effects are beoynd belief considering this was made in the early 80's and some of the most unique camera angles of all time. The most original thing about the whole movie is that we never actually see the spirits, they always take the form of the camera adding to the suspense. The movie also may be one of the goriest of its kind, there is constanly blood and limbs flying in every direction. But of course there are some scenes that will turn some people away like a scene where a girl gets molested by a tree. Bruce Campbell is excellent as the lead who's slapstick style reminds me of an early Jim Carrey. Although it is probably too weird for mainstream horror fans this film have become a cult classic over the years and for good reason.",Null,0,1,22 July 2002
8 Mile," ** out of 5
","One upon a time there was a film, which starred a rapper that took place on the broken streets of a worn down town. The film dealt with such issues as friendship and striving to achieve greatness with the very little you have been given. That film was called Boyz N The Hood and it has come to be one of the most powerful blacksplotion flicks to every emerge from Hollywood. Now, over ten years later, we have 8 Mile, a film starring number one selling rapper Eminem, that touches on some of the same basic principles as Boyz... Foul-mouthed,  white-boy rapper who feuds with his mom and tries to raise his young daughter (this must have been a real stretch for our star). Rabbit lives in a trailer with his mom and her boyfriend whom he hates and vice versa. He wants to be a rapper but finds it a struggle not only with the crowds but also with himself to follow through with his dream. In the opening scene we see Rabbit in the washroom of a local club called the Shelter preparing himself for a battle. But as his eyes gaze over the room he catches a quick glimpse of himself in the mirror and throws up. Seems that maybe Rabbit doesn't have the belief in himself that we first thought he did. For the rest of the film his must face every imaginable roadblock that life can throw at him. He gets in a fight with his mom's boyfriend and gets kicked out, he finds his girl having sex with one of his friends in the studio where he was supposed to record his demo and he keeps getting hassled by another group of rappers known as Free World. The trailer showed this film as being a hard-edged, gritty drama but it seems that the film is nothing more than one big practical joke. Eminem is probably laughing right now as he is sitting in his multi-million dollar mansion counting our hard-earned money. See every time you think the film is going to throw something serious at your face it instead throws a sucker-punch and slaps you with a bit of comedy, ruining the entire build-up of the scene. For example Rabbit comes home to hear that his mom and her boyfriend are fighting. He asks her what's wrong. 'He heard about the eviction?' He asks her. Her reply is no, the problem is that he won't go down on her. In the film's first single Loose Yourself Emienm sings 'You better loose yourself in the music, the moment, your own it, you better never let it go.' I suppose that this song is referring to the rap-offs he takes place in know as battles because that is the only rapping he does this entire film. But if that is the case I don't know what there is to loose yourself in. These battles consist of no more than two rappers who are given 45 seconds to see who can be the most offensive to the other. Some of the lyrics during these battles are even as much as boarder-line comedy. The best way to describe watching this film would be to compare it to listening to Eminem's music. You listen to a song like Loose Yourself and you feel that maybe Eminem isn't just some money making gimmick. He sings about following your dreams and making the best out of what life gives you. Then you flip to a song like The Real Slim Shady or Without me, exposing him for what he really is. I found myself thinking through films most effective moments 'how can I take a guy seriously who sings about gay bashing.' This film only got made because Eminem sold a million records. That's not to say that Eminem did a bad job in the acting department. In fact he handled himself rather well for his first role, but again, even though he gave a good performance I still couldn't help but get a feeling of insincerity while watching him. Next comes Kim Basinger as Rabbit's mom. Basinger seems to be trying so hard that her performance comes off as hammy and over-played. I guess no one let her in on the joke, she acts as if she is the only one on screen trying to do a professional job. I happen to like Mekhi Phifer a lot. I thought he was very good in O and he appears to be carrying this film on his shoulders. His character is a sign of hope and strong ethical friendships, a man who will not let anyone who he believes in fail and Phifer gets that across rather well. Within the film there appears to be two scenes that aren't either making a mockery of themselves or being just plain boring. On in which Rabbit gets into a fight with his mom's boyfriend and during his angry fit of rage, consisting of a stream of never-ending profanity, he sees his daughter and instantly stops. The other is of the same nature when his daughter is witnessing him beat the crap out of his mom's boyfriend. Both of these scenes just broke my heart because it seems so horrifying that an innocent child could be subject to such inhuman acts. Because these two were the most effective I was disappointed that the film didn't show more of the personal relationship between Rabbit and his daughter. In fact almost everything the film presents is almost immediately dropped. To talk about why this film didn't work entertainment wise was mainly due to bad scripting. In Boyz... we were able to feel the central characters pain because we lived a day in his shoes and went through all of his hardships. There were also very powerful lines like 'can't we just have one night where nobody gets shot?' There are no powerful, or even all that meaningful lines in this film. We are never really given the change to know Rabbit either. He goes into his wild fits of rage but never slows down to explain his state and let the audience feel for him, making the film rather boring. If we have no information about a character how can we feel for them? If we can't care for them how can we enjoy watching them? See where I am going? Also the story is just plain bad due to its sketchiness. We know that Rabbit's dream is to become a rapper and his talks about making his demo but the film packs up and ends so quickly that we never really figure out what Rabbit's future could hold for him and if he will pursue his dreams. We are also left without any concrete message that the film is supposedly trying to get across. The final scene shows Rabbit walking down an alley, when the music kicks in. At that point I thought to myself 'Finally the film is going to get started. Just then the scene cut to black and the credits started rolling. I had to sit for a moment in silence and wonder what I was supposed to make of what I had just saw. So when it comes down to it, this was a film that could have been but wasn't quite because it failed to possess the emotion it needed to accomplish its purpose and instead just threw together a bunch of rehashed material to fit its big star.",Null,0,1,9 December 2002

The Hurricane," **** out of 5
","The Hurricane is none but three films in one, not a surprise considering the screenplay by Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon is an adaptation of no less than two books, one of which being the title character's own. One of the self proclaimed, nirvanas is a biopic. Tough, blatant, straightforward. It dictates the life and struggle of Rubin Carter, whose childhood was not an easy one, `All I have to say about my childhood is that I survived it.' The second is an expression in struggle, interest and self-motivation. It is about a boy of little intellect who is motivated to be more than he is given credit for after he is taken out of his home and educated by three white Canadians. It exists outside of the first and works because it focuses around the main idea and not inside of it. The third is about a trial; it is a search for answers and a way to simplify things into film formation. I liked the first two concepts; they worked well together, accenting one with what the other couldn't say in its period. The third on the other hand is where flaw strikes. Not because it is any less important or significant than the others but because it presents no idea of establishment, only rousing scenarios that pit the film against its earlier offerings instead of furthering their conclusions. I went into this film with something that I did not walk away with: thoughts, opinions and questions. In turn I was drained of such feeling as I watched a pedestal of thoughts, opinions and questions culminate that addressed my expectations before even I had a chance too. Rubin `the Hurricane' Carter was a middleweight prize-fighter that spent almost half of his life in jail due to the racism that sprouted from a corrupt police force. An undertone in the film that presents nothing more, story wise at least, than what would be perceived at face value to the real life true story. He was falsely convicted of murdering two men and one woman in a bar during the year of 1966 that is never given a reason for by this film, a good call on behalf of Canadian director Norman Jewison. The first half of the film is based around the life of Carter through flashbacks, as a young black boy named Lesra reads Carter's book, the first and most empowering book the boy will read. Lesra becomes so inspired by the parallels between Carter and himself that he takes a personal interest in the case. Carter amazes Lesra; he sees something in him that only a boy of struggle could understand. And just as equally, Carter sees something in Lesra that only a man of confinement could behold. This leads Lesra to persuade his three Canadian mentors to help Carter fight his case for freedom, collecting facts that were overlooked as evidence the first time around. Carter struggled for freedom for twenty-two years and that final trial is shown in the films third act (a palpable weak link in my opinion). Still the Hurricane works on the basis of discovery. Jewison plays things smart by placing the burden on character and not their surroundings. You want to learn because you care about the characters and not what they did. I guess that is why the ending is weak, it tries to explain the actions taken during Carters life and tries to peg people as labels instead of characters. The screenplay also touches on race, maybe `touches on' is an understated adjective but nevertheless the ideas are there. Carter's resentment towards white people is a strong running theme throughout the film, sometimes even over taking the story, leaving things awkward and confused, seemingly forcing opinions on the audience in a film that wants you to form them for yourself. The direction from Jewison is superb; this is his best film since In Country. This material works well because Jewison knows how to present it in a manner that symbolises something that would not otherwise be stated. This is not a film about jail, or freedom. It is not about boxing or commitment. It is a film about struggle, defiance and personal motivation, as directed metaphorically to be something that you can both connect to and understand as a singular unit. Denzel Washington stars as the title character in a brilliant portrayal of real life struggle that almost seems born for Washington to play. He retains exactly the right amount of poise and suppressed idealism to manoeuvre around the entire emotional ark of Carter, making him just as much a symbolic presentation of determination though suffering as a real life hopeful. He never lets things slip into a pit of sentiment. Even when the story seems to be headed down the insincere path to happiness, Washington brings things back to reality. He reminds us that this is a man whose life has been built around little in positive respect. Washington has crafted a career around films that allow him to express what he has to offer as an actor and not just the dialogue he speaks, this one is no exception. He is one of those rare actors that can make even the drabbest dialogue seem meaningful. Even through insightful phrases like `Hate put me in prison, loves going to bust me out,' The Hurricane worked on so many more levels of exploration than just deliberate sentiment. This film goes deeper than that, its suggests that emotion is created out of feelings and not assumptions.  The end result of this film is like a boxing match. It is unpredictable and could possess many outcomes. It will disappoint some and amaze others. It is tough and filled with spite, but the fight lasts not out of courage, but out of instinct.",Null,1,3,6 July 2003
A Clockwork Orange," **** out of 5
","I try to avoid talking about classic movies. They have already been analyzed to an extent where it almost becomes an impossibility to come up with anything fresh or interesting to say. But A Clockwork Orange is a film that is still making itself today. 	Of course, not of the same effect today as it had on audiences in 1971. With it being placed next to such modern controversy as Natural Born Killers and American Psycho it is hard to appreciate just how original it was when it was made. Yet still it holds strong as the reigning king of controversy to this day, and with changes in society and science fiction on a whole, it is an exception to be made when coming time discuss its content.	At its best, A Clockwork Orange is an `out-there' type of cult masterpiece, staging over-the-top theatrical tactics to make its point, while at the same time breaking it down into mockery. 	At its worst it is still a pretty good, if not an overrated classic of flawed proportion, whose reputation has been built, more so, on the controversy that surrounds it than on the technique of its filmmaking.	The first half of the film lives and breathes its character, Alex de Large. Alex is ` a young man whose principal interests are rape, ultra-violence and Beethoven.' An anti-hero whose mind is set more on anti than hero. A character study all to his own right. He and his `droogs' roam the streets of a futuristic society at night looking for old men to beat and women to rape for something to do. 	But when one of the victim's dies and Alex is betrayed by his friends, he is sent to jail. In jail he hears of an experimental government program that is designed to get criminals out of jail and keep them out. Alex is the first test subject. 	After being forced to watch videos of violent behaviour, Alex is released back to a society that doesn't want him, making him sick to all the ills that he used to be a part of, creating a doubtfulness towards the power of society and politics. 	Some have argued that director Stanley Kubrick `made' A Clockwork Orange. But in the shape of it all, this film is more a vibrant distraction from the lively sarcasm of the much superior book of the same name, by the late Anthony Burgess. 	What Kubrick is missing here is much of what made his adaptation of Steven King's The Shining so disappointing. Failing to implement key story traits, Kubrick directs his vision, but not the same vision of politically incorrect poetry that made the book such a pleasure. 	The book was a first- person character study, existing within the paradoxes of an individual mind without the use of third person analogies. This is not a problem to the genius first half of the film. But after Alex is released back upon the world there is nothing but third party character present, making it unbelievable to distinguish Alex from just another background fixture. Changing from character study to storytelling, forgetting that the story lies in the character. 	The most noteworthy of controversy attached to A Clockwork Orange was its label as `violent porn.' But in looking at such criticism with equal opportunity to criticize we can see that the term `violent porn' has spawned for the narrow influence of individuals who base philosophies on their first reactions. 	`Porn' is an adjective, describing an outlet for gratuitous sexual stimulation. There is nothing that I can find even remotely pleasurable in the horrifying acts committed in this film, and anyone who argues differently has fetishes that run deeper than the content at hand. 	 As for `violent.' It is another adjective, but this time misinterpreted as a noun. Because the word, in this case, is not to be used as a noun we rarely witness the violence. It is a mere deterrent used to describe the atmosphere. On the other hand, the violence that is seen is viewed from a comedic standpoint. That's the gift of satire, you don't have to find it funny to be able to laugh. 	If anything this is a positive film, teaching the Christian belief that it is the right of all individuals to have free will and choice. As stated by Blake Morrison in the book's introductions, `Alex must be able to choose to be good; he must be an orange, capable of growing and sweetness, not a wound-up clockwork toy.' Meaning that an orange may be bitter at first but it has the ability to grow on its own and ripen into something sweet. Unlike clockwork which only works on the basis of what it is programmed to do.	Malcolm McDowell doesn't only play Alex, he is Alex. McDowell goes so far for absolute broke in his take-no-prisoners performance, that it could have ruined the film and career of a lesser man. In a role that is so rowdy, McDowell never takes himself serious Always sporting a mean grin of pleasure and a jolly sort of stance, making him nothing short of unintentional evil. A scene in which Alex kicks a man who is down while reciting Singing in the Rain is of utmost classic and one of the best in this film.	A Clockwork Orange is not an easy film to watch or even all that inspiring of one either. It knows that just as many people hate it and don't understand it as those who love it. But those who do love it love it for the right reasons. Not because it is a well made film. It is nowhere near a definitive Kurbick masterpiece, but because `when a man does not have the ability to chose, he ceases to be a man.'",Null,0,0,8 November 2003
From Hell," **** out of 5
","Before Manson and before Gein and before Burkowitz there was Jack the Ripper. There is something about serial killers that fascinate me but there is something about this film that sits horribly unwell with me, maybe that's half the fun of it. Where Helter Skelter and Summer of Sam gave us a biographical accout (although fictionalized in Summer of Sam) of our well known killers, this film puts us into a time frame where these events happened and tells us not what actually happened but what could have happened. For all those who have not followed the story of Jack the Ripper should know that the case never got the proper explanation it deserved and has gone unsolved all these years. It is 1888 and a madman is killing off prostitutes in a ritualistic fashion. It is up to Scotland Yard inspector, Fred Abberline (a riviting Johnny Depp) who is sent to track down the killer because he posses a power to visualize the crimes in his dreams before they happen. The killers methods are that of an educated man as he always pursuades the girls with grapes and something to drink, then he slits their throat and steals some of their intestines. Heather Graham is the uninteresting, yet important Mary Kelly, on of the whores who seems to be marked for death and also begins a romance with Abberline that is probably unlikly considering the time frame but thats debatable. Ripper followers won't get anything new from the film but is still interesting to watch nevertheless. It is clear that the Hughes Brothers have directional talent. The remind me here of a cross between Tim Burton and David Lynch and must be given credit for not reducing the film to a mindless slasher flick. The film playes more like a dense, atmospheric character study rather than the tense thriller the trailer suggested even though there is no lack of violence and and plenty of gore and did I mention several are very chilling. Where most films like this try to hard to provide vibrent costumes and elegant landscapes this film delievers both but never strays away from the task at hand, it's not out to proove a point, but trying to at least get one across. The only flaw I can visably point out is that the most effective scenes are the ones that feature Jack the Ripper himself, just to bad the film tries harder to portray Depp's drug problems and relationship with Graham that the Ripper seems to be put on a side note than a major plot point like one would expect, loosing a bit of the overall power and effect, but with strong scripting and psychidelic direction this one, although very hard to stomach, is well worth the while.",Null,1,2,2 September 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," ****out of 5
","When a special appears on television showcasing the talents of one or more magicians we tend to tune in to see the spectacle unfurl before our eyes, but why do we o it? The answer is very simple, because it is entertaining and within the programming we see things happen that enchant us, almost like for that short while we are swept away into a whole new universe without ever having to move from the comfort or our own homes. So why do people feel the need to condemn instead of embrace Harry Potter? Usually when a sequel is placed upon us we find that there are one of two possibilities. One, it is just a retread of its predecessor or two, it does nothing more than build upon concepts that were already presented in the first. That is why sequels are not usually found as entreating as the original. But by no means is this film even a sequel of any sort, it is merely a continuation of where the first film so gracesly left off, you will even notice that there are no opening credits to be found. We open our film with a scene in which Harry is visited in his new home by an adorable elf named Dobby (voiced beautifully by Toby Jones). Dobby tell Harry not to go back to Hogworth Academy or something bad will happen to him, but despite the warnings Harry returns and the magic unfolds. The film takes on a much more mature tone than the first making it much darker and scarier, especially for the younger children, but even through all that darkness those young children are not forgotten about and are let off with some mild humour during several of the darker scenes to lighten the load. But humour is not just used for that sole purpose. The film is often very funny, hilarious even (mainly thanks to the highlight of the show, Dobby) giving it a very warm and light-hearted feeling as well. the direction from Chris Columbus is extremely fast paced and astounding. The scene in which the children take part in a witches sport features some of the most exhilarating action sequences I have seen since Spider-Man. The special effects are simply jaw-dropping and marvellous in every way imaginable. Everything has such smooth texture and is places so well among the live actors that it is hard to believe that what is happening isn't actually real. I was also able to pick up a few points from the script that were so ironic they almost come off as satirical. For instance there is a line uttered that goes 'funny how a silly book can cause so much damage.' It would seem to me that by saying that the film is trying to touch upon the controversy that the Harry Potter franchise has started by telling the audience that books are merely an outlet for our own personal entertainment and not made to cause trouble or any sort. Much of the original cast has returned with some new faces here and there. I must say, for a film that relies mostly on performances from young actors there was a fairly high degree of talent to be found from the young stars. It is also nice to know that Richard Harris could end his career on a high note as Albus Dumbledore (The veteran actor recently passed away) and Kenneth Branagh also adds a good does of comedy into the fold as a renowned wizard who may not be all that his reputation says he is. You can also catch a glimpse of Monty Python Veteran John Cleese in a small role but delightful role as a ghost who can remove his head. A lot of fuss has been made from select Christian groups over this franchise, they deem that it is wrong to depict a human with Godly powers, and some even go for enough as to call it demonic. But instead of burning the books and starting protests why can't we just concentrate on the positive. This film has very strong morals on friendship and determination. It also shows teenagers as independent human beings who are just as worthy as any grown-up. So why not give it a rest and take Harry Potter for what it really is, good old fashioned adventure that is highly entertaining and dazzling in epic proportions. You may notice that I have yet to say anything bad about this film, but still it has only received four stars. Well if it is bad news you are waiting for you are going to be very disappointed because the truth is there is nothing wrong with this film as far as I can see. But the fact that I am not a hardcore Harry Potter fan, or even a general Harry Potter fan leaves me with a personal bias. This film probably deserves five star, but because of this bias I was probably not able to enjoy this film has much as the fans would have. Nevertheless it is an amazing achievement or a film that older children and open-minded adults will have a field day with.",Null,0,0,20 November 2002
Psycho," ***** out of 5
","Warning: if you have not seen Psycho stop reading and immediately run to your nearest video store and pick up a copy of it at all costs. (may contain spoilers) Psycho was released during the year of 1960. It was director Alfred Hitchcock's response to a frenzy created by the media's first publicized serial killer Ed Gein. Psycho brings back memories of a time when film was just as much about story as it was style. Hitchcock embodied that, a true storyteller at heart. He was an inventor, using misbegotten images and twisting them into something darkly erotic through voyeuristic tendencies presided inside of characters. Hitchcock didn't make films to scare the audience with what happens, he made films to scare the audience with what they shouldn't see but can't help but want to. I have always said that it is not hard to scare an audience if the initiative is there, but it takes a true mastermind to produce scares that will not take away from the films point, rather uphold it. Hitchcock was that mastermind. Who else could have made a murder scene in which we see a victim stabbed to death but never once actually witness the knife penetrate the flesh and still have it disturb audiences forty years later? The story to Psycho is simple, given the routine inspection. The idea, on the other hand is complex, twisting and turning around corners and bends, leading the audience to grasp onto central ideas and characterization only to turn it around and reinvent itself, as if to have never even implied any motives in the first place. That was Hitchcock's way. Janet Leigh is Marion Crane. We open to a scene of her with her secret lover. She has a headache and is going to work; they may never see each other again. Our interest has already flared. After arriving at work Marion asks for the rest of the day off after she takes an envelope filled with forty thousand dollars in cash to the bank (a client's payment on a new home). But instead of depositing the money she skips town without telling anyone and checks in at the Bates Motel. Here she meets the owner, Norman Bates, who ensures her that he has a vacancy, `in fact I have twelve. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.'  Normal takes a liking to the girl, he is lonely and has no one but his mother. He watches Marion through a hole in the wall of his parlour; he even invites her up to his hillside home for diner. His mother won't allow this, she is much to overbearing we learn, not from seeing her but understanding her through voiced assumption. Mystery begins to peak. This all seems minimal, it isn't. These opening scenes are a form of admission to the good ones, not to say they are any less enjoyable. They build up character, making us feel like we are part of something that we aren't through melding words of falsehoods. We see them as important to building story, they are really a distraction through explanation. Now comes the shower scene, one of the most famous scenes in film history. I should not be giving anything away by saying that Marion is killed off during this scene, that was  one of the many twists. When it was first released audiences could not understand why Hitchcock would be killing off his main character in a climatic occurrence a mere halfway into the film. There is a reason for it as far as I can see. A lot of people regard it as the pivotal scene in the film, it isn't. The scene on its own does not have enough constitution to regard an explanation for itself. The key scene occurs mere minutes before, in the parlour, a scene that coined the popular phrase `A boys best friend is his mother.' It represented a breaking point in the life of Ed Gein that could explain the motives behind all actions to follow. It was speculated that Gein killed his brother after talking ill of his mother (Marions murder), but there was never any proof found to support this logic (we never see the face of the killer). It is for that reason why the parlour scene is to be placed in such high regard. Listen closely to the dialogue in comparison to such a true-life event and then survey the shower scene as, not an action on its own, rather a physical reaction from an emotional exploit. The remainder of the film is almost of an entirely different ilk, as Marion's sister and lover search for an explanation as to why she has gone missing, and a deeper pursuit into the Mrs. Bates character. I won't get into it, for these scenes are so full of uncomfortable mystery and bitter intrigue that they almost need to vindicate themselves. But what I lastly wish to touch upon is the Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. Perkins reminds me of an old Vince Vaughn (who ironically played Bates in the Gus Van Sant remake of Psycho). He delivers a chilling performance from his nervous paranoia, what he says doesn't scare us, but what we think he isn't saying gives reason to worry. Perkins gives a truly masterful performance. There is not a lot of stones left to be turned when talking about Psycho. It has been receiving critical praise for over forty years. And though Alfred Hitchcock died in 1980 he is still greatly missed and still considered one of the most influential and important directors of all time. Revisiting this film only reminds us that, even though he has been taken away from us, his vision will forever live on through his timeless classics.",Null,0,1,31 July 2003
Rosemary's Baby," * out of 5
","(Warning: contains spoilers)	 	Rosemary's Baby is the kind of film that no one really needs to see because with all the notoriety that has come with it over the years we just assume it is good without ever really knowing. 	If I would have saw it during the year of 1968, when it was first released, I may have given it praise of the utmost standard. Focusing my thoughts on its firm analysis of paranoia and how it walls people into situations where the only ones who seem safe from its effects are the audience. I also would have talked about Mia Farrow's career making performance and director Roman Polanski's ability to present motions of fear without the use of blood. But it is not the kind of movie that ages well with admiration. These days we know its secrets, and since we expect them, it's more common to find yourself waiting than actually watching with anticipation, and as Hitchcock once said `there is no terror in a bang, only in the anticipation of it.' 	Rosemary's Baby opens its thoughts in grand old horror movie fashion, with an idea that has very little to do with the rest of the story. In the Exorcist it was an archaeological dig. Here it is the mysterious death of a recently befriended neighbour. I'll admit, for the most part, this scene did have intentions of leading the audience somewhere with ideas of fear, confusion and paranoia. But in a film where we already know something is up, the mystery lies in when the character will finally realize it too. 	In general, Rosemary's Baby focuses on a young couple in Rosemary and Guy, who should have realized that moving into their new apartment was an unwise decision when they find a cabinet that is blocking what appears to be a seemingly normal closet. 	The film then presents a scene, obligatory by today's standards, where the couple is warned about the apartment building's wicked past from a friend who believes in witchcraft and the such. This character is necessary to the film because were it not to believe in its own sense of evil than the idea that no one can be trusted would be lost inside itself. Yet, even in necessity, two problems arise. The first being that if it is a close friend who gives reason for the main character to have feelings of untruth, how can he be trusted even though we already know he is a decent character? 	The other problem comes from a statement that I made in my review for the Recruit. I said that I was not a fan of the `trust no one' approach to writing. With that film I made an exception because `in turn it didnt know itself very well.` Here, writer Polanski knows where he wants to go and I like it even less because it is already suspected why characters can't be trusted. 	With the intention of conceiving their first child, Rosemary and Guy have a truly strange sex scene/dream sequence where it appears that Rosemary is making love to the devil himself? That scene is one of two dream sequences. The first being unsolicited and unexplainable. I suspect it to be a set-up for the future, so that when the second comes along we are ready for it in hopes of an explanation. 	Alas, Rosemary becomes pregnant, but at the expense of her own tainted psyche. Now everything seems strange to her. Her husband is always away and her neighbours are a little too nice for comfort. She isn't gaining any weight and is having constant chest pains, but her new doctor assures her that everything is okay and to just keep receiving the care given by her lovely neighbours. Things become even more confusing for Rosemary when Hutch, the friend, falls into a coma and dies soon after. 	Now Rosemary takes no chances and begins buying books on witchcraft and studies satanic cults. From this she gathers reason to believe that her neighbour is the descendant of a witch and her husband has promised their baby to him in an act representing the second coming of Satan in human form. She's right... the end. 	The biggest flaw that Rosemary's Baby put upon itself is that it confined its paranoia to the central purpose of one character. In pushing everyone else to the sidelines, Polanski makes it no challenge to determine the good from the evil. For when only one character has a reason to fear for herself, the audience outweighs the possibility of innocence in any other characters.	There is no doubt that Polanski is a good director, but he has done better. A lot better. He offers no memorable scenes or dialogue. What is, just is. In that sense, I suppose that Rosemary's Baby may not be a bad movie, just an overrated one. Or maybe I missed my mark entirely while watching it. Still it is anything but Polanski's masterpiece. In his lack of thought and abundance for  feeling we are made digest an awkward balance of predictability and unfocused half-truths. 	Mia Farrow stars as Rosemary, in a confident performance. She runs, she screams and she looks concerned a lot. It's standard horror fare but Farrow sells it by  never once leading us to believe that the world isn't against her. The thing that diverts the focus from the good acting is the fact that Polanski is more concerned with how his characters react to his ideas and not how they exists within their own environment. With this I find it hard to decide whether I should be giving Farrow credit for her performance or taking it away for the directors selfish neglect for everything but his vision. 	Some will probably debate that I may have given away too much of the story to those who still wish to see Rosemary's Baby. But in contradiction to that, I have already stated that this is a film that no one really needs to see. So why bother?",Null,1,3,8 November 2003

","For all of those who expected another Jerry Maguire from the reteaming of Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise will be horribly dissapointed in fact this movie is probably closer in comparison to Eyes Wide Shut than Jerry Maguire, for everyone else with an open mind this may be just your ticket. If there ever was a movie that is too complex for its own good this would be the one, but not in a bad sense. The film is beautifully written by Crowe and had many layers to it. One minute it is a heart-felt love story, next it could be a tense erotic thriller, an engaging suspence picture and finally even a slight hint of sci-fi here and there. Tom Cruise is great as a rich snobbish business man who can't seem to tell what is a dream and what is reality. This film is like The Sixth Sense in that you will probably need to watch it several times to pick up all the hints and clues that lead up to the delightful suprise ending. Crowe and Crusie make a great team and Crowe works his magic behind the camera and Cruise gives us a treat for our eyes. Even though not for all tastes this thinker will satisfy fans of Cruises work in Eyes Wide Shut.",Null,0,0,21 July 2002
Bruce Almighty," *** out of 5
","Jim Carrey provides a cynical look at misanthropy in its cutest form in his new film Bruce Almighty. Carrey stars as Bruce, a one joke, goof-off reporter in a one-joke, goof-off film about graciousness, free will and the existence of a supposed higher power, which will be seen as a return to grace for already converted Carry Fans, and an embarrassment to all other outsiders.  It's hard to access movies like these. They fuel themselves on many formations of the same ilk and hope that the audience is to distracted by the maniacal nature of the burden than the un-honest nature of it of it. But because this is a piece tailor made to suit the star characteristics of Carrey and not address the character of Bruce as a general individual, I suppose no more is to be expected from such circumstances. Now that all attention is on track I suppose it is time to indulge ourselves in the joke at hand. After being fired for a stream of obscenity, broadcast on live television, Bruce finds himself jobless and having one of the worst days of his life. He blames his toil on all but the obvious, himself. He then finds himself face to face with that of who he cured for his misfortune, God (played in one of the film's most ironic twists by Morgan Freeman, who left me with a thought. If God were a white man would he wear a black suit?) Thinking that it's any idiot's game, Bruce is given the power of God and told to make the world a better place. The premise to this film is intriguing I must concur with that, probably possessing the most comedic potential the big screen has seen since the pairing of Adam Sandler and Jack Nichelson in Anger Management. And just like Anger Management, sees almost all but a small portion of that potential wash away in the name of its star's profile. That's not to say that Bruce Almighty is a bad film, it presents a fare share of laughs. There is a scene paying homage to Dirty Harry, a tribute to Jimmy Stewart in which Bruce draws the moon close and paints his girlfriend the stars. There is also one of the films greatest gags in which Bruce parts the `red' sea in such a way to wet even the appetite of Charlton Heston (pun indented). To truly appreciate the wild antics of Jim Carrey one must almost venture back to the grounds that they once spawned from. During this film I was reminded of a scene in the war room from Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb in which the George C. Scott character is supposed to point to the map on the wall but tumbles backward instead. This scene has been said to be of complete unintentional temperament, if so heightening the impact of the scene as a whole. I think of this not because Bruce Almighty pales in comparison to a classic like Dr. Strangelove, but because it makes me wonder how much of Carrey's on screen persona is actually devised into the written script. Maybe Carrey is of much more talent than we all give him credit for? Since we are on the topic of Carrey already I think it only fit to discuss his performance. As an actor Carrey has always made distinctively safe career moves. He plays likeable losers who we don't mind seeing go through a little struggle because in the end you know you will be cheering for them anyway. With the acceptation of Man In the Moon, a film that I would expect no one of eluding to except for Andy Kaufman himself. This film bears no foible in the formula. Carrey is either at his best here, or his most annoying, I assure myself that there is probably very little difference between the two. He presents outbursts of stupidity that you believe some people are capable of but never image anyone doing it until you have witnessed it at eye level. It really only serves as a deterrent from what the film is actually trying to be, something I was willing to let myself become interested in but couldn't due to these unexplained hysterics.  Then we have Morgan Freeman as God, probably a step down from Alanis Morissette as God in Kevin Smith's controversial mess of a film Dogma, but still up there on the irony scale. But Freeman works in his role because he is a natural character actor, never one to shy away from a risk or two. His plays his role with a subdued state of graciousness (he seems almost as interested in getting his floor clean than looking after the world) and an attractive charm. He hits every line with the subtle conviction that one would not expect from such a character, but can't help but resist from such an actor. And still there is that meandering feeling of discontent, how can you praise something for only being what you would expect? There is not very often that a comedy comes along and changes the rules, only to rewrite them in a formal method to fit their utter originality. Such films consist of Animal House, Fargo, and most recently There's Something About Marry. The reason these films not only shaped a genre, but also propelled in to be something else was that they never let the action become lower than the material itself. They are constant and persistent, never becoming out of focus of misdirected, they see their target and aim directly for it. These days comedy is not content on itself, it strays in a wayward fashion, trying to provoke more than it should, and attempting to become something that it wasn't indented to be. That may just be Bruce Almighty's greatest flaw. This is a film that tries to teach that free will equals happiness, not power and that life isn't very fun if you don't earn the right for it to be, but becomes lost in a barrage of potty humour and manufactured sap. I will give credit though, once the film finds itself in the end it does become a touching experience, not in its realism, but in its friendly nature. But then again, in this day and age what comedy doesn't present a touching ending? There is no law in comedy stating that the material has to go somewhere, one of the best films of last summer was an under rated little comedy entitled Barbershop, but there is a reliance that it will take its audience somewhere. I've seen penis jokes, I've seen bathroom jokes, and I've seen journalist in-jokes all done before, comedy should be an experience of something unimaginable not a retread of the already elaborated. Don't get me wrong, Bruce Almighty is by no means a bad film, it is just a film that has nothing overtly likable about it, especially when it is backed by such a strong opinionated topic for exploration. The highlight of the film is almost certainly the direction from Tom Shadyac (who was also at the helm of such great Carrey performances in both Ace Ventura and Liar Lair). Shadyac presents one of the films greatest scenes in such originality; it disappointed me that it wasn't in a film that would appreciate it. The scene sees Bruce walking on top of a body of water with the camera looking up from beneath the waves at Carrey, a shot symbolizing a new found power in the balance but the ever-so-slight blurring of reality, a great shot to accent the films meanings. The special effects of the other hand are a mixed bag at best. On one side of the spectrum the sea parting scene is done with style and hilarity, yet everything else appears to be scammed right out of a Sunday afternoon children's matinee. When all is over and done with Bruce Almighty may have been something, but not that something that it had set out to be. It loses its morals on religion and plays things safe with stupid sight gags when I expect comedy of a deeper intellect. I thought I was getting myself into a film that would break boundaries and have something to say about the state of mind people seem to be stuck in during this present time. I also expect to see Carrey break free and give safety and push himself in the right direction. What I received was a mediocre collaboration of half-truths and recycled bits that didn't have enough integrity to make it into the smart comedies, but hey, that's the way the cookie crumbles.",Null,0,1,10 June 2003

",Trash materpiece focuses on a group of scottish heroine junkies who's lives are turned upide down due to the harsh effect of the drugs they take. It sort of runs like a surrealistic music video thanks to the great direction of Danny Boyle who doesn't hold back on showing us the harrible efftects of drug use. Also featuring a great script that adds enough dark humor to keep the audience entertained but not allowing the film become a parody of itself. Ewen McGregor gives his hands down best performance as a heroine addict that is trying his hardest to quite but just can't seem to bring himself to do it due to the pressures that surround him. Robert Carlyle is also top notch as a short tempered thug who doesn't take any bull and Ewen Bremner is often hilarious as an the absent minded member the group who gets one of the movies funniest scenes when he goes to a job interview on speed. This movie runs sort of like a surreal music video and is nothing that should be taken lightly. I reccomend that anyone who has ever had an addiction view this movie and everyone else who is a fan of these sort of bizzare mindscapes like the Acid House and Run Lola Run will not be let down at all.,Null,0,0,24 July 2002
Signs," ****1/2 out of 5
","Note- reading this before seeing the film could take away from your viewing pleasure! One day the tortoise and the hair prepared themselves for a race. Knowing he had the advantage over the tortoise and sure of his ability to win, the hair flew right by the tortoise leaving him to choke on the dust. Realizing his lengthy lead in time, the hair sat down for a quick nap. Upon returning to humanity from his state of slumber the hair noticed that the tortoise was about to defeat him and ruin his pride. With all his might the hair charged for the finish line with all his strength but his speed was not able to overcome the tortoise's brawn. The moral of the story is `slow and steady wins the race.' Director M Night Shyamalan must have been paying close attention in kindergarten because he makes prolific use of this moral. The hair represents Modern horror films. They try to squeeze too much out of to little. The possibility of victory is present, but the follow-through is rarely executed. Everything seems to be crammed into the first half an hour (if that) and then everything is put on snooze. When finally waking up, the story must charge full-speed-ahead to catch up with itself because closing. Rarely does this happen resulting in contrived endings and illogical situations. Then, from the heavens, a savoir was sent to thwart the sins of these painful horror flicks and make a film that a tortoise could be proud of. A film that is just as edgy as it smart. That man was M. Night Shyamalan and that film was The Sixth Sense. The film moved at the pace of a tortoise (maybe slower) and because of this allowed for strong characterization, deep thinking and to be dramatic as hell. It turned out to be a huge summer hit that thrilled and baffled audiences alike. Not since Psycho was a film so respected that the ending was not given away. Working with the theory of `if it isn't broke don't fix it', Shyamalan returned with Unbreakable. Maybe the film was a disappointment because of the high standards placed upon it from The Sixth Sense, or maybe because it seemed to be nothing more than a retread through old water. Either way Shyamalan tried so hard to make a film that would live up to The Sixth Sense he failed. Now Shyamalan is not a stupid man. He saw a change in the cards for his next feature, Signs. To make another Sixth Sense would have been a bad career move; some maybe even expected that to happen. So he decided to take on an entirely different angle in the storytelling department without sacrificing any of his trademark style. This is the simple story, of a simple man, with a simple life who receives a complex lesson. Graham is an ex-reverend who lives on a quiet piece of farmland with his two unique children and his ex-baseball-playing brother. Graham had a lapse in faith when his wife was killed and now he can't understand why God would do such a thing to him. He bears her burden everyday of his life, often calling out to her in his sleep to receive only silence. `She doesn't answer?' Asks his daughter. But this once simple man is given a rude awakening when unexplainable occurrences start happening around town. Events that see huge circles appear in corn fields, sees mysterious strangers exhibit unusual behaviour around town, sees once peaceful pets turn ravenous in the blink of an eye and sees the world go into a mass media frenzy when these crop circles and unexplained lights start showing up all over the planet. Everything then comes down to, not a war or worlds, or even a war at all, but rather a struggle of belief. As started in the English dictionary, belief is said to be a feeling that something is true, but to believe one must first get inside the unknown and sink beneath the surface, not everything is gained at face value. In religion the argument of `experience' states `some people talk about God in terms of personal experience. They believe that they can know God personally by prayer. Within religion believers sometimes talk about 'encountering God' through prayer and worship. Within the world of religion, some people believe that miracles are events which because of our faith, demonstrate that God is alive and active. That is then countered with the `An unfair God' statement which reads as such ` Some psychologists claim that religious 'experiences' are tricks of the mind, that if we want to really believe in something than we will. Within regard to miracles, even if some were 'true' then what kind of God is it that allows some people to be healed but not others? This hardly seems a God that is fair and just.' The basis of this film is woven around both of those issues. Yet this is not a religious film with a sci-fi twist, nor is it trying to preach to anyone. This film is a deep study of how the mind functions between what is considered reality and what is considered faith. At first glace this appeared as nothing more than an abstract, Saturday mourning creature feature. Such is not the case. Earlier I stated that not everything is gained at face value. This is why it is imperative to look beneath the surface. The aliens here are not aliens at all. There is very little development given to the visitors. We don't know where them came from, why they are here, or what their intentions are. When authors leave characters in their stories nameless it is because they want you to relate to that character on a personal level. In not giving any information about the aliens Shyamalan is allowing the audience to relate to them whichever way the viewer pleases. Leaving this open inevitably lets the audience determine what the film is about and what they will take away from it. Although instruments of fear, the aliens aren't used to toy with characters emotions. They are rather, beacons of faith. There are two types of people in the world tells Graham. There are those who believe in miracles and signs and there are those who think there is no one looking out for them. Since Graham thinks there is no one looking out for him, he is placed into the second type of person. His faith is flailing in the wind, ready to detach itself from the body and soul at any minute, Yet Graham still has the power to grab it if he wishes, but usually it isn't just that easy. With the coming of the aliens Graham is sent on his own personal vision quest. Are they someone's idea of a joke? Did God send them? Did his wife send them? He doesn't know but he is going to find out one way or another. In order to understand a situation you must understand the answers, and to understand the answers you must first search for them. It is the aliens who propel Graham to find those answers to the unexplained things in his life, often without even knowing he is doing it. Shyamalan writes another electrifying script that unlike the Sixth Sense, presents the viewer with the situations and only loosely ties them together in the end. This leaves the viewers on just as much of a search for answers as our main character and allows for more critical thinking than required by The Sixth Sense. Although this method of scripting proved just as effective as The Sixth Sense the ending did seem rather uncalled for. Even though it did its job in bringing everything together, there was nothing interesting about, even ruining some of the dramatic build-up. Also without the `surprise' ending some people will not be able to pick up on what this film is trying to get across. Nevertheless it makes up for that with Shyamalan's highly symbolic storytelling. Have you ever had a puzzle that once completed you glued to a piece of cardboards so that it would never fall apart on you? Shyamalan's direction acts as that glue. His ultra-slow pacing allows for mass character development and allows for greater tension between every connecting joint. He is also able to manipulate the camera in such a way that you are given just enough effect that determining what is important and what isn't is an impossibility. People keep coming back to Shyamalan's films because he requires a great deal of audience participation. You are the ones digging to find the clues; he is only providing the interrogation so that you can be granted access to the characters mind and soul. With a new actor comes a new set of expectations. Bruce Willis would be a hard act to follow if the casting for this film wasn't perfect. Shyamalan knew he has to bring in an actor who could match Willis' dramatic capability. Mel Gibson was the choice and a right choice he was. Gibson gives his best performance since Braveheart. He acts every emotion down to its last haunting detail. We have no trouble feeling that he is going through a time of struggle but he never lets us forget that he is also a loving parents and an everyday human being. Shyamalan has a knack for brining emotions out of his characters that are disturbing and unexplainable but at the same time uncharacteristically human. For a film that had to compete against The Sixth Sense this one was able to hold its ground fine, it's thinking mans version of tell-me-a-scary-story fun. Although it didn't surpass The Sixth Sense its yearning to trying something new was welcomed with open arms making it (alongside Frailty) one of the best thrillers, if not films, that last year had to offer.",Null,0,2,9 February 2003

","Bruce Willis gives his most subdued and by far greatest performance in this haunting tale of the supernatural that will stick with you far after the credits role. Willis manages to impress me more each time he is in a movie (with the exception of Bandits). The story starts off with Malcome Crowe (Willis) a great childrens shrink who after getting an award comes home to find someone who he failed to help in his bathroom. We now fast forward to the present where Crowe is having marriage problems and is helping a young child (Haley Joel Osment in his Oscar nominated perfromance) who 'sees dead people.' Although it is a ghost story it is far from horror, but really a brillient drama that is more about love and friendship more than thinks that go bump in the night. The climax is one of the best I've seen and a brilliant script from writer/director M. Night Shamalyn will keep you guessing right up until the intese ending.

It is the three hour plus story of the owner of one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas. We go through his ups and downs of life and his business. This is by far one of the grestest movies ever made and I am shocked at how even though it is over three hours long it never becomes boring and in fact even blinking might make you miss to much of this amazing gritty and very powerful drama. I have also found that out of all the actors De Niro is one of the only people who actually make swearing sound cool and you better believe there is a never ending stream of it here.

Not just physical beauty but that certain way it glimmers in your eye as it passes, for one second, enchants you in a mysterious way and you don't know why but there is no doubting its presence. You may loose sight of this star or never see it again but every time you look up into the sky, somewhere deep down inside you will always come back to that one star. Landon is one of the popular kids, but one night after a dare goes horrible wrong he sees himself in deep trouble, forcing him to help children on weekends and join the drama club. But through his punishment he is able to see something in Jamie that he has never noticed before and it just so happens that she sees something in him as well. The label romance is synonymous for cliche so don't expect anything new here and it has that 'teen movie' feel to it that kicks the dramatic intensity down a notch and throws in a tad of sexist humour but there is still something very satisfying with the finished product. The film features everything we love to hate: the lead actor who gets by on his looks and not talent, the often amateurish scripting, the sappy tissue box sentimentality and the far to obvious symbolism, in this case the different tastes in radio stations shows the split in personalities and they play that shows the 'hidden feelings that both Jamie and Landon have for each other. Maybe it is Many Moore who actually possesses a great degree of acting talent as the shy choir girl who only needs faith to survive. The huge problem here, along with almost every other teen movie, is that instead of having a major point of development we have many. Landon's reputation, an absent father, a strict preacher and a hurtful secret, but instead of dealing with all of these separately, filmmakers touch on them slightly then cover them up with to much sentimentality (and it's not only teen movies, can anyone say Life as a House?) which gets laid on a little thick at times, often leaving the viewer feeling a little empty at times. But there is an original concept that we are shown in that in that love is a very natural thing. How you ask, well by comparing it to nature. Love is like the sunset or even the wind 'I can't see it but I know that it is there.' We are shown that like the stars or the sunset that we don't know why or how love happens, but we know the world just wouldn't feel right without it.",Null,0,0,6 October 2002

The film is simply brilliant in that it has so many different issues weaven together to create on huge ball of irony, that one finds blinking may take your eyes off the screen for much to long. From the very beginning you get the feeling that this film has more to it than meets the eye. At first glance one may write it off as a modern day attempt at Poltergiest. After veiwing the trailer you may even want to consider it a brainless slasher movie but nothing could be further from the truth. What we have here is the tale of a teenager who's name is Donnie Darko. But Donnie isn't your average teen, see he finds himself drawn at night to a myseterious force named Frank. Frank is a bunny who teels Donnie that in 28 days , on Halloween, the world will end. We also have Donnie's girlfreidn who had to move away because her step-father stabbed her mom in the chest four times and seems to be living a life of torment and personal angst all fueled by fear. Fear is a hard topic in the movie, infact I would say that that one world 'fear' us the basis for everything to come. We also have Jim Cunningham, a motivational speaker that teaches that fear and love are the two strongest emotions that a human has and learn to live your life in the love spectrum of life and avoid the fear. Then we have Grandma Death, an old lady who may just be the most important piece of this huge puzzel. She stands in the middle of the road all day, occasionlly walking to her mailbox to always be greeted by nothing inside. One day after Donnie's father almost runs her over she wispers in his ear 'Everyone dies alone.' Donnie later finds out that in the past she was a teacher and wrote a book on time travel (but to understand that without giving away the plot you must see the film). This comment comes up at Donnie's therepy and along with stories of Frank the bunny his shrink believes that Donnie is afraid to connect with reality due to a great fear of what may come from it. It pains me to say this but the climax of the matches, if not surpasses that of The Sixth Sense as everything finally starts to make sense. This will not only leave you wide-eyed, it will probably take your breathe away as well. The acting is all top notch including as cast of Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swazey and the gripping Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie in his most mature role yet. The love/fear topic is present throughout the entire film and you can look for hidden signs of this scattered all over the film. One example of this is the billing of Evil Dead and The Last Temptation of Christ as a double feature at the theater. The film is horrifying and edgy without becoming cliched or unoriginal, making it not on;t the best, if you will, horror movie I've seen since The Sixth Sense, it is hands down the best movie of the year so far.",Null,1,2,18 August 2002
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," great fun
","In this, the third in the Indiana Jones trilogy, Harrison Ford is back as Indy and getting himself into all sorts of trouble along the way. But this time around Sean Connery is thrown into the mix as Indy's bumbling father and along with Marcus Brodey  they are on a quest to find the Holy Grail. George Lucas also returns with a great script  and Steven Spielberg is again behind the camera working his movie magic. Spielberg uses many unique camera angles to help set the mood and generate suspense. A prime example of this is the scene in which Indy and his father have been tied up by the Nazis. The camera starts on a far off shot and slowly pulls in on Ford's face as he makes his speech on Marcus Brodey, along with the slowly rising music which gives this scene an uplifting feeling. A quick cut is then used so that the audience can see that Brodey is not all he is cracked up to be. The editing is also very believable. In the place scene we edit from plane to plane. Film makers often use this technique to make it appear as if there are more than one plane even though only one is used during filming. There is also an effective scene where the camera goes from the tail of the good plane to the cockpit of the bad plane. There are many methods of creating atmosphere in the film. The music is always dark and depressing when the bad guys are around. Also when the bad guys are making their plans you will notice that it is dark and raining outside. There are also many comedic overtones in the film to create a family oriented atmosphere. Music is key in suspense. When Indy crashes through the window into a dark room the music builds up slowly to create tension. By the time Dr. Jones talks the audience is so sure something bad will happen that they jump at the sudden sound of a voice or loud noise. The music then stops when we find out that it is his father. Between the big name cast, a strong script by George Lucas and great direction bye acclaimed director Steven Spielberg, this is one entertaining thrill ride at its best. I am looking forward to seeing the direction the series will take when the cast and crew return for a fourth Indiana Jones outing in 2005.",Null,0,0,26 June 2002
