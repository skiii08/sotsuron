Blade Runner 2049," Not the classic the original has become sadly 5.5/10
","Not a bad film , just not a great film , was it made for art or money ? I'd say definitely the latter . It could have and should have been so much better . But rarely are reboots a patch on the original they're simply cashcows and they know die hard fans will go and see them . The best thing about the film was the new reclining seats at the Odeon Taunton but a hefty £4 premium means the film has to be exceptional to make it worth it. This wasn't . It was too long , the first 30 minutes were brilliant and 8/10 but then it went downhill . Ryan Gosling is brilliant in the starring role but sadly Harrison Ford ( here comes the backlash from fans ) was below par and looked so tired in his role . The glamour came from humanoid cyborg to which the mystery was surrounded . The CGI wasn't as groundbreaking as the original . But it kept to its film noir roots but it just simply wasn't as good as hoped and it was far too long to be enjoyable . Pad.A 5.5/10",6,5,10,23 October 2017
Rocketman," All you need is love
","There was a scene near the end that was near perfect and deserving of 10/10 but the rest of the film meandered too much to achieve that accolade .Warning don't go to see this expecting another Bohemian Rhapsody it's a completely different type of movie - it's closer to La La land or Mamma Mia on its jukebox approach to a musical film.Undoubtedly there will be a stage version of this it sets itself up for that . It's a retrospective film using many dream sequences that tackles the price of fame namely , sex drugs and rock and roll and hides no secrets of his sexuality- the male/male sex scenes might surprise some for their graphical content.The film could have been better but it's not a bad film - it's a good film - it's close to 8/10 but there were too many musical scenes where the songs were shared by various characters and not enough live performances . But they weren't all bad you can see them working in musical theatre it was just that they sometimes seemed incongruous in this film.The key relationship that lasted through the film was the brotherly love between his long term writing partner Bernie Tauren excellently played by Jamie Bell who for me was the star of the show .Apart from Bernie the only other person who loved and believed in him was his nan .The marriage to Renata seemed to be rushed and unexplained - it wouldn't have distracted from the film if it was edited out .Ultimately the film was the story of longing to be loved , loved by his parents , friends , lovers and the lack of achievement of that love and replacing it with drugs and alcohol .The story doesn't end with the present day but rather at a point in his life where he realises he needs to change his ways and we are left with an update on today in the credits .Pad.A 7/10",7,5,12,22 May 2019
A Star Is Born," Gaga is great
","Let's start with the positives Lady Gaga is great definitely a screen star is born and I think we will see her a talent in a lot more films to come . Her film career will far surpass that of Madonna and could see her playing Eva Peron equally as well .One of the most important parts of a film in this age of short attention spans is the opening 5 minutes and sadly the first 30 minutes were really poor until they sang the now infamous duet together . But the love story didn't feel real and you never truly believed their relationship .There were emotional moments but the bits it between were boring and laborious . For the most part it seemed to a competition between Sam Elliot and Bradley Cooper to see who could have the deepest and most impossible to decipher voice ! Subtitles would've helped - for a film which had as one its themes failing hearing it would have helped to handed out hearing aids to the audience in parts and ear defenders in others as the music , which was an integral part of the plot was pretty awful for the most . So it made it unbelievable that he would have become such a huge star in the first place .Bradley Coppers acting and direction were good but it's failing was the music , the script and the lack of tension created .Is it worth seeing - yes but don't go expecting too much I did - if you want to see a film that's almost twice as good and features music see bohemian rhapsodyPad.A 5.5/10 Padreview",6,0,7,14 November 2018
The Death of Stalin," Super Shakespearean style Satire 9.5/10
","Superb script , you probably already know the actual history but the way it's been condensed into this Film based on the French graphic novel is superb . This would make a fantastic stage play written in the Neil Simon style with more than a sprinkle of Shakespearean political skulduggery. The chess game that went on in the background after Stalin's death to produce his successor from ambitious rivals who manoeuvre to protect their own skins under the pretence of doing it for the collective good . In a period where life and death were just a word away there could only be one winner but like a Roman emperor victory can be short lived if your back is a magnet for knives ! An intelligent comic romp with excellent caricatures of the names you'll know from history that will keep you laughing from start to finish whilst educating you about this period of history .

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," 7/10 Rogue one hour slow one hour great
","Apparently George Lucas liked this but don't let that put you off . Thats not as controversial as it sounds obviously he's God to Star Wars fans but in my opinion The Force awakens ( which he didn't like ) was the best Star Wars film so far ( on par with the first film directed by the man himself from 1977 which is now the fourth film due to the substandard films George Lucas cashed in on with episodes 1-3 ) in terms of enjoyment and couldn't have been better . Rogue one was great but it could have been better , the first hour was quite laboured , the final hour made up for it and was brilliant . Felicity Jones and Forest Whitaker stood out as the stars ,there were some blink twice moments with deceased actors brought back to life by cgi , leaving you wondering where Hollywood could go next ? Can they now make a compete film with deceased actors thus saving on fees ? This has been a box office phenomenon with $900m being taken in on a $200m budget already . A very sensible investment by Disney and the first two films they've produced have been crowd pleasers too.Star Wars purists will enjoy it as well people completely new to franchise . Looking forward to the next one.RiP Carrie Fisher",7,0,2,15 January 2017
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvellous
","Had no idea what to expect well that's not true , I expected it to be rubbish .But I was wrong this was thoroughly enjoyable and a great coup delaying the release of this powerful female led film to the minute past midnight on international women's dayThis isn't my genre but Galaxy for the Guardians or whatever it's called changed all that - add humour - keep the fan boys and geeks happy and you've got a winning combinationWriting , casting , acting , cgi , cinematography and script all top notch . It will be enjoyed by those like me who nothing about the story and by those who love the story .There will of course be those who think they could have made a better film but will never be satisfied.A fitting tribute and cameo by Stan - RiP - he'd be proud - here's to the next one .Pad.A 9/10",9,12,31,24 March 2019
Passengers," 8/10 It can get lonely in space
","Chris Pratt has come a long way since his first appearance in Parks & Recreation . He has trimmed up and now a bankable star and well worth the reported $12m from an $110 budget , not sure Laurence Fishburn deserved his $20m though . Jennifer Lawrence is the star here , her characterisation was perfect and thoroughly scary at times . When I write my reviews I am very careful not to include any spoilers so rather than elaborate on the above I will concentrate on the story and technical aspects Basically it's a Robinson Crusoe moral love story in space and it plays it well . Well written , good supporting cast especially Martin Sheen as the android barman . The set is spectacular but that is a necessity for the big screen but you could transport this love story to the small stage . It's a likable film with likable characters although scary at times . A love story with moral dilemmas and sacrifices . Best science fiction film of 2017 so far . Enjoy.",8,4,6,15 January 2017
Us," More rabbits than Ann Summers
","If you loved GET OUT then you'll love to see this until you realise this is not on a par with or anywhere close to the brilliant 'Get out' - this is more of a 'Don't go' film.Where 'get out' was clever and original this just struggled to find its feet - at times it seemed like a zomcom but most of the time it was just a 'what on earth is going on!?'Such a shame I was hoping for so much more . It had promise . The opening was good , the build up was good but as soon as the mystery became reality it lost the plot literally and just dragged .There was attempt a retribution and explanation at the end but it was too little too late . Whereas with 'Get out' you wanted to see it again and recommend it to everyone - this one you were just glad it finally ended and you'd never want to see again and would only recommend to people you dislike !Avoid like a plague of doppelgänger zombies !Pad.A 3/10",3,5,9,24 March 2019

Thor: Ragnarok," Superb tongue in cheek Fantasy Sci Fi 9/10
","I have to admit this blew me away , I wasn't expecting to enjoy it but this was a really funny enjoyable piece of entertainment. Definitely worth seeing . This is not my genre but this will appeal to those who love films like the LOTR trilogy as well as those who love the humour in Guardians of the Galaxy . Jeff Glodblum stood out as Grandmaster. As well as the Stone revolutionary South African gladiator . Kate Blanchet was superb , there was even a small cameo role for Scarlet Johansen completing the Avengers assemble . As a complete novice to the genre and knowing very little about the franchise - it came across as a mix of Sci Fi ( of the Star Wars ilk ) mixed with myth and fantasy tied together by an excellent script and great comic lines .Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleson were great as was the Hulk / Banner and Valkyrie . The only let down was Anthony Hopkins - his performance was below par for such an excellent actor . Plenty of action and CGI for those who like their cinematic fix .It's a film I'd definitely see again maybe in 3D or in the reclining seats :) Pad.A 9/10",9,57,103,24 October 2017
Lion," 10/10 And the Oscar for best film goes to ......
","GO SEE IT .Films just do not get any better than this . Truly exceptional . Everything you could want in a film , No lions were hurt during the making of this film but make sure you take a box of tissues. Where do I start ? The story is heartwarming and will have you crying , smiling and cheering . The acting was superb , Dev Patel is superb as the mature Saroo and Sunny Pawar was magical as Young Sarro. Although it would be wrong to compare this to Slumdog Millionaire ,it has all the hallmarks that made that film enjoyable to watch and has all the hallmarks that make it deserve to win the Oscar for best film , if Lalaland wins it'll be a travesty . The Weinstein company have the Midas touch , and this is a worthy addition to their incredible success in backing winning films . How they made this film for only $12m is a miracle especially with a major star Nicole Kidman in a supporting role. David Wenham and both actors playing Mantosh deserve credit . The cinematography was amazing and will make you want to visit India and Tasmania . 10/10 need I say more ?",10,3,6,24 January 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Friends will be friends right till the end 11/10
","Love of my life11/10 in short this film is SUPERBNow I've got that out of the way - the theme is loveLove of a friends , love of a man for a woman and man for man, love of a family ,love of work colleagues , love and adoration and the search of love for oneselfBe prepared it's an emotional roller coaster - it's a film of dreams hopes and aspirations and the ups and downs all of that encompasses . It's a film about trust and deceit . It's about a maverick and it is about Mavericks that make them unique.This couldn't have been done any better , I personally hate films longer than 100 minutes but after 137 minutes I waited till the end of the credits and wanted an encore !I think the success of this film will see a raft of musical biopics - Rocketman about Elton John comes out next year , and I'm sure someone will make one about George Michael , Prince , David Bowie , Michael Jackson , Marc Bolan the list is long ... and I could even see a remake of Pink Floyd the wall with a story and dialogue in there rather than relying on the music and animation of the 1982 version .You probably know the story and you know the end but it handles the life of Freddie Mercury and Queen from their beginning in 1970 till the highlight of Live Aid in 1985 and fifteen year period of rise and fall and return to superstardom - I want it all and I want it now .RIP Freddie 1991 - you were so loved , you are still lovedDedicated to Mary Austin the love of his lifeThe show must go on.Pad.A 11/10 ( in the rock tradition of spinal tap level 10)",10,180,287,25 October 2018
Justice League," Cinema goers deserve better than this rubbish 0/10
","It's really sad to see that this rubbish is churned out by Hollywood , was there a story ? no ! Was it fun to watch ? No was it possible to stay awake throughout the whole film ? No So it's taken $176m at the box office - what does this mean ? There will be plenty more films likes this cause it's where the money seems to be and it's business but it's really sad because people deserve more - there's literally no redeeming feature in this film . Superman films of old with Christopher Reeve were fun , they had humour , the CGI was basic but you believed in them . This was just like watching someone play a computer game over their shoulder there was no attempt to draw you in as a viewer . It's such a shame that after the deserved success of Thor and Guardians of the Galaxy we are back to being dished up this rubbish , there's really no justice ! Don't bother unless you like a film to have no substance whatsoever - waste of time , waste of money , terrible movie . I've heard that Wonder Woman was actually OK, I missed that , no doubt there will be another installment as long it's not called Aquaman vs Wonder Woman I'll give it a go but Inot expecting much after this rubbish ! 0.25/10 Pad.A",1,27,57,30 November 2017
Split," 7/10 You always hope for another 6th sense but ...
","Unfortunately this isn't one but its better than 99% of M Night Shyamalan's follow ups. Danny Boyle said your first film is always your best and with the MNS that's always been the case but we all hope he can replicate it. Many of the reviews contain spoilers on here which is the last thing you need for a suspense thriller so I'll just concentrate on the acting .A lot has been written about James McAvoy and he undoubtedly portrayed someone with DiD very well but for me the star of the show was Anya Taylor Joy her portrayal of Casey was superb and key to the whole plot , that and the taxi driver will have you questioning what you've seen after though you won't realise at the time and to avoid spoilers I won't explain why . That's what makes a great MNS film its the bits you just don't see coming , it cerebral horror not gruesome graphic gore. Having said that there were elements of the film that reminded me of Hostel with a touch of Psycho.Is it worth seeing ? Yes , is it as good as Sixth sense ? No Is it better than most of M Nights other films ? Yes . Don't go with high expectations and you'll definitely enjoy it. Great cameo right at the very end to look forward to too .This film only cost $10m and will make ten times that at the box office here's hoping his next outing is even better now he's bankable again.

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," 7.5/10 Fantastic Treat
","I came to this having not watched all of Harry Potter so was pleasantly surprised that my lack of previous knowledge didn't prohibit my understanding of the plot. I can also understand why it was set in New York , it opens up a whole new chapter(s) for its biggest market and this has already recouped it's $180m budget. The CGI and recreation of late 1920s NYC was amazing . Great cast and a beautiful love story between Jacob and Queenie . Colin Farrell's was excellent and he the wittiest line 'put down those wands' interesting cameo in there too .Overall this was a good film , thoroughly entertaining , 7.5/10 not quite an 8/10 with the love interest between Jacob and Queenie the unexpected added bonus particularly after the negative line 'who would marry him' Enjoy",7,0,2,13 January 2017
Jackie," 8/10 For one brief moment there was a Camelot
","I have said many times that the best films this year are based on true events and this falls into that category . It's not perfect and at one point it was only worthy of a 6/10 as the pace was slow in the first quarter and the film felt quite flat . But it all changed when the children were introduced suddenly you were inside the mind of a woman who had the most enormous pressure on her to have the almost impossible task of grieving privately whilst being exposed to the world's thirsty insatiable press . Natalie Portman's portrayal was extremely good but slightly overshadowed by Peter Saarsgard as Bobby , there was a good supporting cast including English actors John Hurt RiP and Richard E Grant ( he might be South African ? ) The film's sequence was unusual but as you get drawn in to the character you realise it was actually clever script writing , this was an insight into true royalty and has parallels with the death of Diana . The biopic stops short of her life as Jackie Onassis nor does it even attempt to become a biopic about her it's really about the death of JFK and the aftermath from her point of view Definitely worth a watch but expect to shed a tear or two",8,0,1,22 February 2017

The Favourite," Perfectly lit period drama
","This is probably the first period drama where the lighting was near perfect. That gave the film the necessary atmosphere for conflict.Now apart from that the film was in itself near perfect at one stage it was running at 10/10 but it lost points due the camerawork . There were times when the sweeping angles and one camera set up made you feel nauseous- together with the overuse of fish eye lenses .The central theme was strong with the rivalry between Lady Marlborough ( Rachel Weisz stole the show in this Lady Macbeth type role ) and a rising maid ( played affectionally by Emma Stone ) for the affection both in and out of the bed of a bisexual Queen Anne with the backdrop of conflicting politics surrounding the continuing war with France led by the national hero and distant relation of Winston Churchill the infamous Duke of Marlborough played excellently by Mark Gatis.Olivia Coleman has come in for a lot of praise for her role as Queen Anne , but it was the suppprting cast who were so good that they stole the limelight , not least Nicholas Holt as the leader of the opposition.It reminded me a bit of The draughtman's contract but with an appeal to a much larger audience , British cinema has come a long way since Chanel 4 revived it in the 1980s .A enjoyable film with a few surprises if not just a little bit too long but certainly worth seeing and worthy of the praise it's getting .Pad.A 8/10",8,3,6,10 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," An insult to Sergio leone
","I really wanted to enjoy this despite never liking any QT films in the past , I wanted to give it a chance - nearly three hours later I feel robbed , robbed of my time , my money ( although it didn't cost the extortionate £12.75 as I have an unlimited card ) and my intellect.From start to finish the film plus trailers lasted 3 hours - 2 hours of tedium sitting around 4/10 and then in the finale it drops to 1/10 .If you're going to add historical characters and occurrences then at least have the dignity to stick to them .The final scenes were far too violent and and then took on the genre of a zombie movie which seemed to get the audience laughing and I'm not sure if that was the intention .Margot Robbie was wasted as Sharon Tate , she never really had a chance to act - Leonardo acted his heart out as always and Brad's contribution was eerie . But what let this down was the script . It was plotless and it when it finally got the the final scene it was ruined by deviating so far from reality .There were some impressive factors however but the bad bits overwhelmed the good parts . The recreation of the 1960s was impressive although seeing Pan Am 747's flying in 1969 was either a purposeful error or all part of the Hollywood 'fairytale' playing with history - since it didn't enter service till 1970.Overall it a poor movie and plays little homage the the brilliant Once upon a time in the west . It's undeserving of the title .This is certainly not a classic , ironically this is the first QT film without Weinstein backing but it's still taken over $100m in its opening weekend making it one of the most successful films of 2019 so far - it had plenty of 10/10 reviews so the QT fans are happy so if you like Reservoir dogs , Pulp fiction and the like you'll probably like this too . I didn't on both counts .Pad.A 1/10",1,5,12,14 August 2019
Get Out," 7.5/10 Runaway hit - classic mystery horror material
","I made a BIG mistake , I read reviews before seeing this and unfortunately they contained spoilers grrrr - I always try to avoid spoilers and simply let you know whether it's worth seeing or not . Well this is definitely worth seeing . It lives up to the hype and the trailers . Let's talk about the positives - Acting - superb lead role by Daniel Kaluuya he's come a long way since being a parking warden on Harry and Paul . Can see this $100m plus box office hit from a $5m budget catapulting him into the Hollywood big time . Great supporting roles from the rest of the cast in particular Caleb Jones who's sinister presence was felt in every scene he appeared in . Music - the music was superb right from the ' run rabbit run' opening scene - eerie and atmospheric throughout . For a horror there probably weren't enough jump out of your seat moments but it certainly was a cerebral horror and had elements of classics such as Wicker Man , The Village and Hostel in there . Overall this was a good film , it's worth seeing , it's not the best film I've seen but it's certainly not worst . It's above average and will definitely appeal to horror fans .",7,8,17,20 March 2017
Aladdin," Guy Ritchie's best film to date
","Well that was a visual masterpiece - just seen it and it's well worth seeing - now I've got to be honest I know the story , well you know the story but you've probably seen the 1992 version with Robin Williams - I actually haven't but the song 'Whole new world' seemed very familiar !A huge budget of $180m has grossed over $600 - something tells me Disney made a wise decision to employ Guy Ritchie . Second boy of honesty I've never really enjoyed his films I'm not a fan of the cgi induced Sherlock Holmes franchise - but I can see Disney making an Aladdin 2 from this .The story is a classic though not as old as you think although derived from the Arabian Nights it was a relatively modern day take on the classic tale by a french man which has been the story adapted over and over again that we all love .It's a musical - that won't surprise many as it's a reinterpretation of the 1992 animated version in live action , brilliantly cast - Will Smith and Naomi Scott steal the showIt's a family feel good movie well worth the watch .

","Watched this today , international women's day , it's an important film about equality . It shows how far we've come but we've still got a long way to go . Three strong female leads defying the odds overcoming the challenges of sexism and segregation. Costumes were spot on as were the cars , what I loved about this film is it started as a 6/10 but then grew and got better and better as the film went on . The key was the script which was amazing , I had no idea this film would be as good .

1917," It's good but it's not a great
","Take a dollop or Saving Private Ryan , take the finale of Gallipoli , ignore the build up of All quiet on the western front and you've got yourself a film which is really good but not as good as the above .Having said that , it had its merits . The story , the cinematography and the craft of the hand held one shot were all compelling .Without a doubt Sam Mendes has produced an exceptional film and the 10/10 reviews show that the majority of the public have enjoyed it . However for it felt like there was something missing or things missing . I didn't feel my questions were answered , there was little background information about the main protagonists and no explanation about how the brothers chose or were given different opportunities. We didn't really learn anything about the enemy , the rats had a bigger part in the film than any characterisation of the Germans . Those who were portrayed were stereotypical baddies . With 100 years passed we all are patriotic and grateful for the losses of our forefathers but films like The Water Diviner ( 2014 ) go some way to explain the background . With a title like 2017 the story deserves praise for not focussing on America entering the war and pandering to Hollywood and the risk has paid off a film about British sacrifice has succeeded at the box office because it's a human story .It's not perfect and it doesn't have the charm of War Horse but the realism of the aftermath of battle give it a realism that many other films overlook . It won't satisfy those who want to see an action war film . It's linear story with an against the odds plot that you can absorb yourself in .It's good. It just could have been better . The emotion of the final scene makes it a must see , go with low expectations and you'll love it .Pad.A 7/10",7,1,3,24 January 2020
Logan," 4.5/10 It's all about Laura
","There were moments of this film that were actually quite good and they all starred Dafne Keen as the young Laura . The partially mute mutant who may or may not be the offspring of a certain X Man. I'll put a bet on that the follow up movie will be called LAURA ! I went to see this as a non X men fan but hadn't expected that to be an issue . Hugh Jackman looks the part and looks suitably old and tired in the role . Patric(k) Stewart on the other hand looked quite sprightly by comparison.The trailer offered so much more , there should a be a law against using songs in trailers that play no part in the film ! Secondary there needs to be a law that all editors must be immediately out of a job if they allow a film to run into three figures, 99 mins is long enough 110 tops , there's simply no excuse for films going on this long , it ruins the enjoyment , this film started at 2130 and it's now the early hours of the next day after midnight and I've just left the cinema . The film is set in 2029 , twelve years in the future but there was very little effort to spend the $127m on making the film futuristic , OK his car was slightly updated but almost every other vehicle , bar the paramilitary vehicles , were current or older . Yes there were driverless shipping containers but one scene , lazy fortellling indeed. The finale was about the only scene with any fast paced action , by this stage you're anaesthetised to the violence and glad the film is finally almost over. Good supporting cast with the Swazi-English Richard E Grant in a sinister role and Stephen Merchant unable to shake off his Bristolian accent . If you're a die hard fan I'm sure you'll love it , if like me you're not , you probably won't . But what do I know - this will fill cinemas for the next two weeks , however this advanced screening only had 17 people in it and I could hear one person snoring throughout half the film !",4,8,29,2 March 2017
Midsommar," Fails to live up to expectations
","If you're like me you'll see the trailer and poster and think this is going to be some sort of homage to The Wicker Man the 1970s cult classic starting William Woodward .The start was good , well once they got to Sweden - some interesting drone shots and experimental camerawork - I don't think I've seen an inverted shot used so well .You're constantly expecting life to be more sinister in the traditional Swedish northern village ( an armish type community ) where the weather at midsummer was uncharacteristically sunny - playing to the homage of the Wicker manOnce the film ups the notch in the sinister side which took far too long - this film is almost three hours including the adverts - you'll feel that despite some shocks it could have been scarier and should have been - there's an element of HOSTEL about it without the gore but certainly in its culture shock .Ultimately the film was a let down and quite sad - although the main protagonist seems to finish the film with renewal and joy , you're unlikely to feel the same .4/10 Pad.A",4,7,12,9 July 2019
La La Land," 7/10 Homage to Hollywood ...city of stars
","It's easy to see why this so popular with Hollywood it about The Hollywood dream . What better way to express that than in a musical. I'll be honest I love the genre , musicals dominate my top ten films of all time . They encompass pure escapism , romance , and put a smile on your face throughout and maybe the odd tear too . Best of all you can watch them over and over again :) How did this this perform as a musical ? Poorly to be honest , yes there's romance , yes there's escapism , but the smiles were sadly missing . Undoubtedly you'll fall in love with Emma Stone , Ryan Gosling's performance however was substandard in comparison , you never really felt his character had true ' I would die for you ' passion for Mia . I loved the homage to Hollywood however , particularly the mash up of Ricks bar in Casablanca throughout . The whole premise of a musical is mad people don't generally break into song and dance in the street but when they do in this movie they're able to do it tongue in cheek and with humour recognising how bizarre their actions are , I loved the use of spotlighting in musical sequences , just wish there were more musical numbers and maybe a few full cast dance numbers , the opening sequence gave you a feeling you were in for a traditional musical with a touch of Mamma Mia popularity but it never transpired . On the negative side the movie did try and tick too many boxes and could have benefited from better script editing and adhering to a true romantic story line but perhaps that was its aim , like the breakaway from traditional jazz there's an attempt to break away from the traditional musical . The overall theme was that fantasy is better than reality and this was enhanced by the closing scene . Life is so much better in La La Land :) There were a couple of musical numbers you won't be able to get out of your head , I liked the film , just wish I could have loved it , I ought to want to see it again but I'm not bothered and that's where it failed on the whole .

Snowden," Who's the good guy and who's the bad guy
","Generally speaking we all love our country and are patriotic but this film really questions who is the good guy and who is the bad guy .This is a well documented true story so there's no spoilers here but what is great about Oliver Stone's movie is story behind the story - great storytelling about the background to how Ed Snowden got to be where he was and there was no doubting his patriotism right from the start but in the end the machine ( being the government ) like skynet turned on its owners and started to spy on those who were their ultimate paymasters without their authority without their knowledge and what he did by being a 'traitor' was an act of heroism depending upon how you feel a government should be allowed to go in the pursuit of knowledge about ordinary folk under the false pretence that it is in the name of national security , rather than an inability to keep one's hands out of the cookie jar . The film keeps your interest from start to finish and tells the story in a series of flashbacks starting from the meeting with the Guardian journalists in Hong Kong . You feel like your watching a Modern day Turin played by young Kevin Spacey lookalike . Rhys Ifans deserves praise for his acting without a trace of his trademark welsh accent . The love between his girlfriend and him with the added pressure of stress at work , his moral dilemma and failing health all adding to the drama . You are left hoping the real Ed Snowden is allowed to return to his home country and receive a fair trial or amnesty for you feel what he did was in the interests of the freedom of the people who in a free world should be able to trust their own government. Finally what it does do is show how prophetic the 1998 ( pre 9/11 ) film ENEMY OF THE STATE was where everything revealed in this film prophecized ! Pad.A 9/10",9,0,1,2 September 2018
The Disaster Artist," A film about friendship 6.5/10
","OK. So I had no idea what I was walking into and actually thought I was in the wrong screen - I judged the book by its cover and thought I was seeing a black and white film , something like The Artist ! So it took a while to fathom what was going on ,I couldn't understand why a 20 year old Mercedes C 220 was supposed to be special , only later did I realise this was set in the recent past ( despite the brand new Rolls Royce drop top shown at one point ) once I realised it was set around the millennium it started to work , weirdly I kept thinking I was watching the son of Tom Cruise playing the joint lead role Greg . Basically the story which I only realised at the end was based on a true story and an actual cult film ( can't believe The Room was never mentioned once in my film degree ! ) is about a chance friendship of two males both of which need each other to fulfill their dreams . They're both dreamers but one mysteriously has the financial means to make dreams come true . Tommy is an interesting character full of mystery , completely eccentric but incapable of forming meaningful relationships with anyone which was sad to watch as clearly he had his heart in the right place but his talents didn't match his ambitions whereas Greg had the talent but lacked the ability to promote himself and see a golden opportunity when it was in his face due to his loyalty . In some ways it reminded me of The Producers though they went out of their way to make a flop this film ROOM became a cult because it was so unintentionally bad So the film - Well if you're a fan of Apatow/Franco/Rogen then you'll love this and you'll love it if you're a fan of the Cult of The Room . Did I like it? Yes - I laughed in parts and I hadn't even realised it was comedy , I'd say it's more drama than comedy, I wouldn't rate it as highly as The interview or many of their other collaborations but as a craft , a story - it had a beginning , a middle and an end so it is a watchable story - you get to know the characters and you engage with them . Basically it tells the story of the making of the film and it tells the story of a friendship ad it does both well . It's a good film it's not an exceptional film but I'm glad I saw it :) If you don't have the talent but you have the money no one is going to stop you realising your dream !

Joker," Two faced
",There are two sides to the Joker and one side you have sympathy for and the other side is a deranged psychotic killerThis film takes you on a journey and delves into the creation of a monster and his troubled upbringing - you feel sympathy for his mental state but once the monster is unleashed you cannot hold any sympathyAs a stand-alone movie it works well and takes away nothing from Heath Ledgers superb performance - Phoenix's performance is superb and has rightly come in for huge accoladesFor me it wasn't the knock out 10/10 that everyone's giving it but it's not my genre - but it's definitely worth seeing whether you're a fab or not or just a fan of anarchy in the purge / v for vendetta traditionWorth seeingPad.A 7/10,7,4,10,4 October 2019
Kong: Skull Island," 6.5/10 definitely worth seeing much better than you'd expect
","This is one of those films you think won't live up to the hype and the first quarter was so poor it was looking like a 3/10 but my friend I went with said 8.5/10 at that point and at the end the best film she'd seen this year , better than LION . So it just goes to show there's a film for everyone out there . Once the silliness was over with and you're able to accept the sheer unreality of the script, after all it's about a giant ape ,it's better once you give it a bit of leeway . Once they get to the island things improve after the on screen arrival of John C Reily who adds humour to the film . There's eye candy for the girls in the form of Tom Hiddleson and the chaps are bound to notice Brie Larsons skimpy vest getting tighter and wetter as the film proceeds . There is also plenty of action , plenty of jumps , the CGI is amazing , if i'd seen this in 3D it would have probably scored 7.5/10 It's definitely worth seeing. We both enjoyed it . Here's to the sequel",6,2,5,20 March 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Death on the rail 6.5/10
","There's some outstanding points in this film namely 1) Kenneth Branagh - his portrayal of the world's greatest Belgian detective is the best I've seen by far 2) Cinematography- exceptional alpine backdrops . Hand-held camera-work was exceptional 3) Casting - superb all star cast But then there's the points that weren't so good Some of script / delivery of lines was unintelligible Some of the CGI was brilliant but some was quite poor and at one point the train looked like a child's toy! Also it felt a bit like the Polar express at times and that's over twelve years old ! Overall the film just could have been so much better it had all the ingredients , setting , cast , story but it failed to deliver a top notch performance. Shame really as I really looked forward to this and grudgingly paid the extra Â£4 for a reclining chair ! It sets itself up for DEATH ON THE NILE - I just hope that's a better rendition .

Midway," Great action shots marred by poor script
","Let's start with the good stuff - the cgi and POV action shots were amazing .The bad stuff - the script was awful :( the main protagonist was a stereotypical American hero but it was an annoying characterisation and rather being drawn to the character you end up disliking the character altogether.For a chinese financed film there was little mention of the shocking 11 million deaths as a result of WW2 at the hands of the Japanese. It did mention the 250,000 killed for helping the American army pilots escape .Was it better than the most recent Pearl Harbour film ? YesWhat was enlightening was that the film was dedicated to both sides who fought at midway both the Americans and Japanese and like Tora! Tora! It attempted to show both sides . It gave sympathy to those who die for ones country whether that country acts right or wrong .Is it worth watching ? - YesDon't expect too muchPad.A 5/10",5,3,8,13 November 2019
Life," 6/10 Life but not as we know it
","OK I had hoped for more , the trailers were enticing and Jake was doing the rounds in the UK drumming up interest . It's not a bad film , it's above average not spectacular, some elements may be scary in 3D but it wasn't Alien by a long shot , the CGi was great but the suspense wasn't there neither was an emotional engagement with the characters . Good all-round performances by the multi national and lingual cast . Rebecca was very convincing as British ( though her upbringing in Sweden was multi lingual ) I had to blink as I thought Will-I-am was in it . What was a let down was the actual ending , the build up was superb but there could have been much more mystery at the end with a cliffhanging ending. What was best about it? A) the first 30 mins B) the lack of gravity felt realistic C) the song in the closing credits d) the science and hope for life Is it worth seeing ? Yes Is it worth more than 6/10 ? No Would I watch it again ? Yes probably when it's on netflix or amazon video in a few years",6,1,3,27 March 2017
The Hangover Part III," 0/10 Hoped this would make up for H2
","I had very low expectations and even those weren't met . H1 was good and that's where it should've ended. H2 was bad , the $100m budget for H3 may have been spent on marketing and possibly on the opening 5 minutes and royalty cheques were cashed in very soon and no one was really bothered about the comedy as the laughs were simply non existent - hope those who were tricked into the cinema got their money back - please don't make H4 - Please it just waters down the brand -OK Aiplane 1 & 2 were both good but rarely do comedy sequels measure up they're just a cash cow - look at the Police Squad films - hopefully Dumb & Dumber to might buck the trend :)",1,1,2,26 December 2014
Green Book," The Oscar for best film goes to .....
","Without a shadow of doubt there is no more deserving film for best picture than this one .The story is equally as important now as it was when it was set in the early 1960s . I have said many times that films based on real events make the best films .This is a story of ignorance and one man's attempt to rise above the hate and violence - like a Ghandi type character his strength came not from the fist but from his conviction that he was right .It was a story of an unlikely friendship where two worlds collided and the master servant relationship was juxtaposed.If you like drama with humour , with laughter and with tears this is the film for you .Brilliant 10/10",10,1,1,7 February 2019
Incredibles 2," It's not incredible but it's Ok
","Not great , not bad - exactly average . It's entertaining, it doesn't keep your interest all the way . The baby is the star of the show . It's a girl power themed movie with two strongly cast female characters both seemingly on the same side. It's reliant on the good v evil story line with the mystery of who is behind the evil side kept reasonably suspenseful . It's hard to see how this cost $200m to make but perhaps 100% CGI animation is more expensive than meets the eye ? It's hard to believe it's been 14 years since the first instalment !? But this one has grossed $600m so far so Disney / Pixar well and truly know their stuff and are quite capable of making a fortune from an average product . There's an added bonus of a short b movie at the start which was enjoyable and moral . 
Is it worth seeing ? yes - just expect it to be average and you won't be disappointed. Pad.A 5/10",5,1,5,25 August 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," 9/10 Please God let me save one more ...
","Brilliant. Make love not war .'In peace sons bury their fathers , in war fathers bury their sons'Not the film I was expecting at all . Having purposely not read reviews beforehand I was expecting a Hollywood war film saying we are American we are great and promoting the glory of war , glossing over alleged war crimes by the allies and just showing the enemy as evil without any balance portraying their enormous losses of some 100,000 Japanese soldiers killed and half the civilian population of 300,000 died as opposed to 20,000 losses on the allied side in total during the three month battle for Okinawa. So I was not expecting to enjoy the film at all and the opening scene confirmed my fear. However from then on the film took completely different twist. It was a Very sympathetic moral personal journey of the main protagonist sympathetically played by Andrew Garfield . Excellent supporting cast particularly Hugo Weaving as the father . You grow to really admire Private Doss as do his colleagues eventually , his undoubted heroism shows that there is more than one way to be patriotic . I'm not going to go into more detail so as not spoil the plot but will just say this is a blood and guts war film for people who do not like war films as well as a war film for those who like action with a romantic twist to boot.The set of Maeda escarpment was excellent and cinematography revolutionary in terms of Its realism and with some irony was similar to the battlefield of Gallipoli , a film that starred Mel Gibson the excellent director of Hacksaw Ridge . The best three films of 2017 so far have ALL been based on true stories LION , SULLY and HACKSAW RIDGE If like me you were thinking this wasn't your sort of film don't hesitate , go see it , only two films have surpassed this in 2017 and none of them were Lalaland !",9,3,7,30 January 2017
Sully," 9/10 SUPERB Well crafted storytelling
","Best film I've seen this year so far. Superb storytelling , fortunately I watched this having not known the actual story beyond the headline. It meant all the drama and revelations were real to me . Superb acting , directing and special effects . The Tom Hanks / Clint Eastwood combination was a match made in Hollywood perfection . Great supporting acting by Aaron Eckhart and Anna Gunn. A human story , a triumph over adversity , a battle against the system , huge respect for the rescue services , makes you think of the events of 11/9/01 I'm a great fan of the 90 minute movie , if you can tell a story in 90 minutes why run to 120 ? And there's an added bonus in the final credits so stay around till the end Best film of 2017 so far so why have the award ceremonies overlooked it ?",9,0,1,15 January 2017
