Come and See," Very depressing
","Come and See was impressive and at the same time the kind of movie that has you leave the room unable to speak to your friends until the movie leaves your head. It starts off slow, building some momentum as it goes when you grasp the location, time, and situation. Slowly the movie turns itself upside down then flips you right side up every now and then, then repeats the process. The movie becomes more and more insane, and right when it hits rock bottom, it gives our protagonist a bit of pause where he laughs and calms his nerves... Slightly.Definitely well shot, and the most amazing part is the lack of digital editing, where everything was done on set. Every tree that dropped was actually blown up, and every sound was produced in a studio if not on the set.Really powerful movie, which shows you another side of the war.",9,0,0,30 May 2012
