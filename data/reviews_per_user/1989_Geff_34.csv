Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Much should have been cut out.
","Not as good as Volume 1Much should have been cut out. Not much could have been or should have cut from VOLUME 1, but I think this half was left uncut to make a second film possible. Tarantino is known for his elimination of the unnecessary, and he always gets right to the point, quite poetically, but this is unlike his style. It's Tarantino plus waste product. I was disappointed because I wanted the scenes to move, and they didn't quite do that crisply. 'Art is the elimination of the unnecessary.' I dozed-off at one point. I enjoyed the other scenes that were true Tarantino. Not a bad film, but one that SHOULD have been better. I wish the studio heads would leave him alone! If they had left him alone, he may have on his own cut it down to one 2 1/2 hour film that was lean.",5,1,3,27 April 2004
3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Yuma greatly overrated (spoiler alert)
","3:10 to Yuma was a disappointment. Many have compared it to Unforgiven, which is a true gem in the school of realism. 3:10 is so far from realism that it hurt me to watch it. So many things happen that are just plain stupid and unreal. The last thirty minutes require that you suspend disbelief, as the saying goes. Even though the cast is good and the acting is OK, the story itself is absurd. The casting is proper and all fit their roles, especially the 14 year-old son. The cinematography is good, but not great. The acting itself seems to fit the moment, though Russell Crowe seems bored at times. The original 1957 film 3:10 to Yuma with Glenn Ford is superior to this version. I was just so annoyed at many parts because of unintelligent moves or comments by the characters. Spoiler alert: One example is that Evans does what he does for the money $200. Then he is offered $1,000. to let Wade go, and he turns it down because people will wonder where he got all the money. No one in the entire film seems to care about where money comes from. Or he could simply move away. Just not smart in so many different parts. This film is greatly overrated and will show itself for what it is when the smoke settles. See Unforgiven or Lonesome Dove for realism, not this turkey.",4,3,7,14 September 2007
The Equalizer," When you're a vigilante, it's tough to stay retired, I guess.
","The Equalizer stars Denzel Washington as a man who tries to leave his past behind by faking his own death, but life catches up with him. He witnesses a young, beautiful girl brutalized and enslaved by ultra-violent Russian gangsters and decides that he has to come out of retirement. He uses his black-ops skills to kill everyone in his path, despite his promise to his now dead wife to be good. When you're a vigilante, it's tough to stay retired, I guess. On a scale of 1 to 10 as an action movie, it's a 10. He can kill faster than a vampire, and he times himself to see how fast he is. It is a fantasy vigilante film, and he gets revenge in super-super-human style. You must suspend disbelief to enjoy it fully. Good film of its genre. The audience got into it and were cheering in good humor.",8,2,9,30 September 2014
Gravity," There is no Gravity...the movie sucks
","I am astounded that this film got such high ratings. Special effects alone don't make a good film. There is nothing original or clever or intelligent or uplifting about this waste of time. I wanted to scream; it was sooooo boring. OMG, 90 minutes of Sandra Bullock acting like an ass. Where are the Great Wallendas when you need them? The plot is preposterous and laughable. The story is boring and totally unbelievable. Go see Phone Booth for a good picture with a single setting. This film is a joke, or should I say that the reviews are a joke. Don't waste your money on this one. A film needs more than special effects to be a good experience. I was sooooo bored!!!! I wanted a crocodile to show up at the end and devour her.",1,22,46,9 October 2013
Underworld," Gripping, dark, medieval, unique birth of a new creature
","This film has it all. Good story line, action, great special effects, and a good cast. It really scares you, and the adrenaline rush is real. It's gripping, dark, medieval. There are no good guys; each character is more evil than the next. The creation of a new super creature makes this a classic in the tradition of Dracula. The film has the promise of sequels. I wasn't bored for a second, and the story line was solid, contrary to what I had heard from the intellectually challenged. This film has great sound effects, too. The werewolves are the best they can be, and one attack made the audience cringe in their seats. This film sets the standard for werewolf films from now on. A classic. 10",10,1,2,28 September 2003
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Not for dimwits.
","I was pleasantly entertained for the afternoon. I really liked how they drew you into the characters and the war. It developed. It was intelligent. Minor things could have been better like the accents (speech coach), and why the islanders accepted or tolerated the Italians and not the Germans. It was beautiful to see, and to listen to it was beautiful. Many people in the audience sat through the end credits to listen to the music. Beautiful love story. Not for dimwits, and a must for lovers.",10,3,5,21 August 2001
Argo," best thriller in years; madness all around
","Not since Jaws have I left a movie theatre and brought fear with me. It is a palpable fear brought on by the film's credibility. The Iranian Islamist extremist characters are all monsters and very intelligent and very scary. At times, I was reminded of Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now when he writes in his memoirs, 'Drop the bomb; exterminate them all.' This film really depicts the futility of trying to bargain with mad men. They are depicted as killer apes in human form; madness permeates the country from top to bottom. This is not religion in any way, shape or form; it is madness. Every scene is directed with such a deft touch by Affleck, and it is definitely one of the best films I've seen this year. Memorable is a word I would use to characterize it. Don't miss it.",10,3,7,25 October 2012
The Others," See the others.
","'THE OTHERS' is a film title that says a lot. If you go to a multiplex theatre, go see the others, not the film 'THE OTHERS,' but any of the other films. I don't understand the high rating it has now on IMdB. It is a total failure as a horror film. It didn't horrify me nor anyone else. They laughed. When it ended, I heard groans from the audience, which was an even mix of adults and children. I don't know what is happening with the ratings! Are people that hungry for a good film that they will pretend to like it, or do they scare too easily, especially at nothing but loud noises. I was so disappointed that I felt cheated. And, finally, after watching Nicole Kidman's face for two hours, I can understand why Tom wants out.",2,0,0,14 August 2001
Deadpool 2," One film that you must miss.
","I was bored, dumbfounded, confused, and deeply disappointed. I was not entertained. I did not like the constant crashing and bashing with no ill effects. I almost fell asleep. Don't waste your time and money. See UPGRADE instead. Now that's a great film for the same price of admission.",1,83,205,18 June 2018
Dear John," Been there... and a comment on the DEAR JOHN film reviews
","I went to see Dear John just to see if they caught the emotion involved with this sort of thing. Mine occurred in 1969, and it is still sometimes painfully disturbing to me. The film caught the intense youthful attraction, the relationship that can develop in a short period of time before deployment, the love that resists separation, but only for so long, the intense feeling of loyalty for comrades that you've trained with and fought with, the addition of the 9/11 country-at-war component into his decision to reenlist, and the painful solitary existence suffered by a youthful female waiting and living only by letters and consequently driving her to another relationship, despite her love for her soldier. 'Frailty, thy name be woman.' (Shakespeare) As to many of the comments, I can say to the negative ones, I saw the film and disagree. The film was right-on. I don't care ever about comparing a book to a movie. You can't compare apples and oranges. One should judge a film for its making and its cast and acting. The book is the book, and the film is the film. I'll give you an example of the reverse, a bad book made into a classic film. The Graduate is a classic film that broke many Hollywood moulds and was superb as a film. As a book, however, it was cheesy and redundant and, in my opinion, poorly written. So, one should judge a film solely on its merits, not on a comparison to a book. It is not a legitimate judgment, nor does it make for a legitimate review. The only time I would include a book in a review is if the filmmaker leaves out a detail in the film that is included in the book, and it is a necessary component to understand the meaning of the film or the outcome of the film. For example, the ending of 2001 A Space Odyssey, was completely unintelligible to the ordinary viewer if one had not read the book. That was a major flaw that affected one's ability to understand and enjoy the film. This is an example of when the book can be introduced into a film's review. Dear John was a perfectly clear and understandable film. There's one more thing. Some of the male lead's (Channing Tatum's) detractors said in lengthy reviews that his acting was abysmal. I thought he was accurate in his portrayal of a young soldier living with the thought of imminent combat or deployment to a lonely and difficult assignment anywhere in the world. Also, his father stole the joy of life from him, and not intentionally. He, as an actor, portrayed that perfectly. I have never seen nor heard of him before, and I've never seen his prior work, but he was right-on for the character he played. Why do reviewers waste their time comparing films to the book? It is not a legitimate component of a review other than what I mentioned. Please don't waste your time and mine with comments like, 'The book was much better.' Who cares?! Dear John is a very good film.",10,9,19,14 February 2010
Pacific Rim," Pacific Dim
","Not very bright screenplay. Pathetic in places. I think it was really a plot to get people to buy tickets to a dinosaur film. I was rooting for the dinosaurs. However, the pea-brain sized dinosaurs were smart. They had high SAT scores. This was a sad disappointment. Thankfully, I did NOT see it in 3D. They wanted another $4.50 to see it in 3D. Also, you could not discern the robots from the dinosaurs in combat thanks to the terrible cinematography. You can't see who's winning the fight. It is schmaltz to the 10th degree. Save your money. See it on TV in ten years. Oh, and one more thing. You need sub-titles to understand the Australian. gidday.",4,1,8,26 July 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Magnificent Epic Adventure
","It's one of the great films of all time. This film has incredible special effects, great action, magnificent sound track, superb casting, and cinematography at its best. The scenery is awesome to behold. I had to see why this film had the highest IMDb rating I've ever seen, and now I know why. I was mesmerized. It's a classic.",10,0,0,23 December 2001
Van Helsing," The best of the Frankenstein, Dracula, Werewolf Genre.
","I just saw it and loved it. I almost chose not to see it because of the morons who panned it. The special effects are what everyone said they would be. Great. Best werewolves ever and awesome Gothic settings. The storyline is solid, unlike what others have declared. What were they watching? Dummies. Vampires in cloudy daylight, not direct sunlight was offered as the reason they were out during the day, and they wanted to surprise Kate. Great action. Dracula's accent was just fine, and so were those of his wives. What a bunch of malcontents to criticize a film of this caliber. In the future, this will grow to become known as a classic despite the recent low ratings and criticisms from some IMDb members. Critics take note! This is a first-rate film, one of the best of its kind, and obviously a labor of love.",10,0,1,28 May 2004
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," This is a greatly unappreciated film. I loved it.
","Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. I love to review a film this good and this unappreciated. The mood is very similar to Sleepy Hollow. It's dark and woodsy and beautiful in a scary way. Children are missing and witches are suspected. The film is smart enough to poke fun at itself, but serious enough to scare the hell out of you. The witches are ugly, powerful, intelligent, merciless, and dark. The film is a gem in its cinematography, casting, cast, acting, and story. I was expecting less and got a lot more for my money. Don't believe any negative reviews. Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton star in this film that's definitely NOT for children. Expect very violent battle scenes between the witches and the two bounty hunters, Hansel and Gretel.",10,2,5,26 February 2013
The Men Who Stare at Goats," A crashing bore and certainly not at all funny. Trite try at humor.
","I gave it a rating of one for 'awful.' I had to try very hard to focus as it was so boring. The most interesting part of my afternoon at the movies was at the end of this film, one 'Goats' patron was heard demanding his money back from theatre management. The patron felt that the film was a total rip-off and stated, 'That was a total rip-off. I want my money back!' The film's attempt at humor was sophomoric and in the realm of the absurd, but it was too stupid to make it there. What was the underlying meaning? None. Was it an anti-military film? If it was, then it was a disaster. Not meaningful, not fun, not even silly. Jeff Bridges must feel embarrassed because he did just that, embarrass himself. Kevin Spacy, one of my favorite actors, was awful. He looked terrible, puffy, out of shape, squinty eyes, like he was hung over. I felt bad for him. It was his first terrible acting performance. I waited for something to happen. Nothing does. Nothing happens. This is a film for those who go to a terrible restaurant and have a terrible meal with terrible service, and then go out and tell everyone how great it was.",1,10,24,20 November 2009
Collateral," Could have been better with more effort
","Effort: C+ Some conversations on the phone were not done well, with the audience waiting and waiting for something to be said. It was painful. Poor screenwriting is to blame for that.  The shooting scenes were not at all into the school of realism, but Tom Cruise is great. Too many unreal scenes. It was exciting, but it was also annoying at times. The whole premise is unreal. The person behind me in the theatre said at the end, 'Thank God it's over.' I didn't feel that way, but I was intellectually numb as the credits started rolling. I didn't feel cheated, but I didn't feel great about the experience either. It was both good and bad. It's a 7.",8,0,0,11 August 2004
Dunkirk," One of the most dishonestly over-rated films of all time. 1 of 10.
","Yes, awful. How can anyone honestly give this film a positive recommendation? It is so amateurish. Whoever wrote the screenplay forgot the story. What story is it! It's not about Dunkirk, the famous WWII evacuation of British troops from France. What about the French troops? The British commander says to hell with them. Two cowards are the focus of the story. They will do anything to get out ahead of everyone else who are patiently waiting, keeping order, and waiting their turn. One other is picked up by a civilian boat on its way to rescue troops at Dunkirk, and he fights the crew to not go back. He kills one of them. Great story? I figure they used 5 planes to make the entire film: three RAF fighters, one German fighter, and one German bomber, all classic planes. Why I say this is b/c they only show three RAF fighters in one scene, and then it's always a one-on-one with all the other scenes. The special effects are from the 1950's. I think they did a better job in Wings, 1927. Also, it's hard to figure out what they are saying. I missed half the dialogue, but I didn't miss much b/c it's so worthless a film. It's aimless, boring, pathetic, and cheap. There is nothing epic about this film. It's a sad joke. What a waste of my money. It's one of the most over-rated films of all time.",1,519,899,28 July 2017
Pearl Harbor," AWFUL FILM, as experienced by many.
","Here is an awful film that spends a ton of money to fake you out in the first three weeks to make millions. It is terrible, and any comments that you see that are 'positive' are untrue and false. If you want to see a true Pearl Harbor classic, see TORA! TORA! TORA! You will not be disappointed. It's a four-star classic, and it's historically correct.",1,0,0,27 May 2001
Man on the Moon," Wait. Read all of this re Man on the Moon.
","This  was given a ten by me, and I hated Andy Kaufman when he was alive, and I still do. This is a first-rate film. It is excellent (10) and has nothing to do with liking or disliking Andy Kaufman or his routines or Jim Carey doing his routines. I always hated watching Andy Kaufman on Saturday Night Live because I knew he was crazy and not funny, but Jim Carey does a good job in recreating the routines and you get to hate him and the routines. The movie is a separate entity. It does a great job of telling the story, and this is a class film. However, Jim Carey is too likeable to have played the part because Andy Kaufman was really too hateable for anyone to like in real life. That's how he wanted it. He was crazy! This is a great film.",10,0,0,10 August 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," One of the best films of all time...
","This is quite literally a breathtaking work of art. Gasps of admiration were heard in the theatre when some scenes began. The beauty is stunning. Action and romance and adventure are just a part of the total film. Characters and costume and dialogue are all perfect and fill you with awe. You may find yourself asking, How did they do that? This is quite literally one of the most beautiful and interesting films of all time.",10,0,0,13 January 2001
The Mist," The audience was laughing out loud. LOL 1 of 10
","The first hour was a snore, and then it just got dumber and dumber. The preaching lady was symbolic of Christian fundamentalists and really made fools of them. Only Christian-bashing is allowed these days. Imagine if it were the Koran they were mocking instead of the Bible. Stephen King would have to go into hiding like Salmon Rushdie did. The token Black was a total moron and an anarchist. He was so stupid that I could see Al Sharfton getting on his bandwagon about this one. Bring out his soapbox. How can Hollywood dare to bring back the stupid Black stereotype without complaints? The dialog was moronic and banal. The characters were so farcical that the audience was laughing at them and their lines. It was something to do, at least, because nothing was happening for the first hour. Then those stupid mechanical insects showed up. Kill them with burning mops! This movie was just so dumb that it really hurt to watch it. The Crawling Eye (1958) was much better. Only the last five minutes of The Mist is credible. That's all I'll say about that. If you think the good user comments about this film are real, you are in for a BIG disappointment. I am not kidding...the audience was laughing at the film. I was starting to think it was supposed to be a comedy. It is. It's a future cult-classic. Go and LOL.",1,23,48,25 November 2007
Mulholland Drive," A pseudo-intellectual delight
","Here's a film with an obscure meaning that really means nothing, which is a pseudo-intellectual's delight. It means nothing and goes nowhere. It keeps you in suspense until your IQ should have kicked in. Too bad it didn't. This film is an adventure into nothingness. I hated this contrived piece of nonsense. I watched it twice to be fair, but I came to the same conclusion. Nothing.",1,8,18,10 May 2002
The Imitation Game," Best Film I've seen this year. Best Film in a long time.
","I just saw The Imitation Game, and it is a film experience to remember. The film is based on the British WWII team that broke the German 'Enigma' code. It is mainly about one brilliant man who led the team, Turing. The cast is superb and includes Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, and Allen Leech. All are perfectly cast and perform flawlessly. The cinematography, costumes, and screenplay are all excellent. The settings move from the 'present' in 1953 back to 1928 and then 1941, back and forth continuously, woven together perfectly. If you want to see a fascinating thriller where the future of the world is really at stake, this one will not disappoint you. I think it's one of the best British films to come along in a long time.",10,3,11,10 February 2015
Jurassic World," Jurassic World (2015)
","Firstly, the most important thing to me is that overall I was entertained. That doesn't mean that there were several things in and during the film that annoyed me. I had no idea where the twin Blutosaurus came from. The total disregard for the safety of the thousands and thousands of tourists on the island was totally sick. The casting all around was either wrong or could have been much better. Where have you gone Marion Dougherty? There are parts of the film that are 'dead air' and should have ended up on the cutting-room floor. The ego-centric, ditsy, almost-stupid and incompetent park manager was a major annoyance. The hierarchy of the park is always in doubt as to who is really in charge. The toothasaurus was definitely in charge. The warning system was by phone: Hello. 'Houston, we have a problem.' Godzilla has escaped. And that brings up the idea I had that this would have been a perfect film for Godzilla to re-emerge. There were too many instances of humans outrunning sprinting 60mph dinosaurs. The macho-man hero, who really did nothing, accomplished nothing, and ended up subservient to the ditsy, irresponsible aunt-in-charge, was cast perfectly; too bad he did nothing. With all its shortcomings, it is still an entertaining film. With a better cast, a better script, a better super-monster, it could have been a real contender for eternal greatness (but it's not). One last note: I loved the (flying) Teradactyls! Again, I was genuinely entertained for the most part and the time flew by.",7,4,16,24 June 2015
The Insider," The Insider and a great performance by Bruce McGill
","The Insider is one of the best films of all time. Great performances by all, including a gripping performance in a courtroom scene by Bruce McGill. When I think of The Insider, and Al Pacino and Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer and all the other great performances, I think of that courtroom scene and McGill (D-Day). He should have gotten a Best Supporting Actor award for that one scene. Check it out. The Insider is definitely one of the best thrillers of all time, and based on the true story of the legal case against the tobacco companies. After seeing this film, you'll know why you could never quit smoking. Only Russell Crowe, the insider, knows why.",10,3,3,1 April 2015
The Dark Knight," The MOST highly overrated film of all time.
","I could not believe what was on the screen. I fell asleep twice because it was boring. I looked up IMDb.com to see the 'memorable quotes'...all the quotes listed are boring and trite. Then I looked up the 'user comments' and then I screened the comments to see the most negative, which are listed under the category 'Hated it.' I agreed with them all. Here are a few headlines from them in order: 'Mediocre.' 'Convoluted farce.' 'The Dark Nothing.' 'The Dark Knight is overrated.' 'Falls short of greatness.' 'This movie is the proof that the world is becoming a sick and dumb place.' 'Are you nuts?' 'The jokes on us.' 'Too much of everything.' 'Had to do it...' 'Best film ever? AHAHAHAHAHA.' 'Packaged Hipness and Faux Aggression.' 'Plot so thin, it passes unnoticed.' 'The Dark HYPEpotamus !' 'A massive let down after the brilliant Batman Begins.' 'This was not a good film.' 'what happened?' 'Absolutely not dark. Hardly Batman-like.' 'This movie was a joke...' I agree with all of these headlines. It is unbelievable to me that everyone is going crazy over this film. 'Batman Begins' was far better. Save your money.",5,7,18,5 August 2008
Up," Pixar Pixar Pixar Pixar Pixar Pixar ?????? What's going on?
","I started reading the reviews for 'Up.' Strangely, every review refers to Pixar. 'What can I say about Pixar? Amazing?? Perfect??' 'Pixar launches their funniest film out of their tank to date.' 'Possibly the best Pixar film to date.' 'Pixar hits it out of the park, again' 'UP, Pixar's latest animated feature, is just delightful.' 'Pixar do it again! Up soars to new heights!' 'Pixar produces another Oscar Winner.' 'If Pixar - as a studio - has any weakness, it's that they have no idea how to make a bad film.' 'Pixar soars again.' Pixar is God. Pixar for president. Long live Pixar! What's going on here? It really struck me as odd that so many consecutive reviews referred to Pixar. I would think that legitimate reviewers would refer to the film first, then to the plot, then to characters, and sometimes to the director if he/she is famous. I have grave reservations as to comments posted regarding this film. Has Pixar hired a team of professional writers to bombard IMDb.com with positive comments with rave reviews? As my usual practice is to skip the first two pages of reviews on IMDb, I am aware that this practice of insider reviews does happen. i.e. terrible film gets rave reviews in the first two pages, then followed by all terrible reviews and ratings. In the past, it was only the first two or three comments that were posted by insiders, and then it progressed to a page or two, but this may bring it all to new heights. As with the voting, there can be cheats, and IMDb.com has got to look at this again and see if I am correct in my assumptions of cheating in the comments. It is a terrible disservice to the honest members of the web site. If the comments are accurate, then why did 6.1% give this film a rating of 1 to 5? Where are the negative comments? And 38% of viewers rated it from 6 to 9? 7,837 voters gave 'Up' a perfect score of 10, and a total of 6,170 scored it below that number. So, it's almost an 8 to 6 as to perfect film versus good film / terrible film. Where are those comments? All I read in the first several pages was Pixar, Pixar, Pixar. One just has to read the first page of comments to see what I mean. What's going on?",Null,0,4,9 June 2009
The Shape of Water," Black Lagoon is being nice. Preposterous rhinoceros.
","Isn't it strange that reviews with a 10 rating and very high platitudes for the film always involve Director Worship. In this film, who cares who the director is. I care if he did a good job, but I don't need his filmography or a critique of all his films, nor a comparison of this to that. Silly, boring, and pretentious film. Try to stay awake or not laugh out loud. Here is an example of what may be a studio review. 'The Shape of Water' is beautiful. Writer and Director Guillermo del Toro tells the story of the shape of love, that it can look any way you can imagine. His screenplay along with co-writer Vanessa Taylor tells the poignant tale of feeling alone in the world, and the possibility of love that we all deserve.' Studio or real?",1,9,27,30 January 2018
It Chapter Two," Coulda been even better. VERY high quality film. Pokes some fun in some scenes.
","This is an extremely high quality film with a lot of meticulous input from the screenwriter and director. Too bad the last hour was an ending that just dragged on and on and on. It should have taken 10 minutes to end this. The casting was not Marion Dougherty for sure. She made casting into an art form. Look her up.
The opening gay bashing scene was not in the book and seemed forced. Really good CGI and cinematography. Pennywise in this version is more evil and bloodthirsty and ruthless than in the previous two films/TV mini series.",8,0,0,26 September 2019
Kong: Skull Island," King Kong 2.0 'It was beauty killed the beast.'
","Kong: Skull Island. It's an adventure and exciting. It's also stupid and moronic. Samuel L. Jackson plays himself in his own special dense way. His character is oblivious to common sense and logic. John C. Reilly is there for comic relief, I think. A slimmed-down John Goodman is the scientist/explorer who is leading the team to explore Skull Island, just off the coast of Vietnam, 1973. The atom bomb tests weren't what we thought. One was to kill something. That's how stupid this can get. However, it is a real adventure if you dumb-yourself-down to 5 years old and just enjoy it. Great scenery, special effects, cinematography, and the giant ape is appropriate. This film makes up for the first King Kong in 1933 that broke my heart at the end when Carl Denham says, 'Oh no, it wasn't the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast.' I always hated that ending. This film's ending is better. So it's up to you, but I can say I was entertained.",7,1,3,23 March 2017
The Terminal," WARNING: VERY POOR-QUALITY FILM DESPITE THE POSITIVE COMMENTS
","I have just read the comments regarding this horrendous film called The Terminal. It proves that Spielberg, Hanks, and Zeta-Jones must have a million relatives who belong to IMDb. Anyone who sees this film and actually likes it knows nothing about film quality, casting, screenwriting, editing, musical score, and characterization. This film is a joke, and the makers of it are laughing at you if you saw it and said that you liked it. This film has no credibility. The music is dreadful. The actors are miscast. The screenplay is laughably stupid and on a 7th grade intelligence level. The ending is unbelievably stupidly written. It has so many flaws that one can tell that the movie-makers did not care in the least about something called EXCELLENCE. This film shouts, 'We don't care, but you idiots will like it anyway.' What else can I say to warn people off? If you see it despite my warning, and you hate it, make sure you warn others by commenting here on IMDb. Remember that.",1,31,64,9 July 2004
The Terminal," Simply Awful and CONTRIVED
","It was an awful and boring and painful experience. I was so bored and angry throughout the film. I am still angry. It shows how Spielberg and Hanks and Zeta Jones can use their money and advertising clout to suck us all in. They make their money and stick us with two hours of their contrived and silly ego trip. Give me a break. This film is really dopey. It will tick you off. Avoid it. The beginning is boring and stupid. It is based on the idea that this dope(Hanks) can't walk through two doors to get into the United States. With 40 million illegal aliens in our country, this is just sooooooooooooooooo stupid. Really stupid. Stupid. And the ending is an insult to your intelligence. Stupid, also. Stupid is as stupid does.

Hacksaw Ridge," One of the best of the WWII film genre. Amazing.
","Hacksaw Ridge: I just saw it and had to write. I left the theatre in a deeply moved state. The film about America's only CO to win The Medal of Honor for heroism in combat is stunning in its realism and depiction of the horrors of the South Pacific Campaign in WWII. The story is true, and at the end of the film the real main character addresses some of the film's content. The special effects are incredible to behold, and the thunderous roar of the battleships' big guns is only topped by the barrage of huge explosions on Hacksaw Ridge. I was additionally attached to the film's content b/c my own father fought in three similar battles in the South Pacific in WWII. He never spoke of it. I only found out after his death in 2010 that he was awarded six medals during WWII and fought and survived three of the most savage battles in the war against Japan: Anguar Island, Peleliu, and Luzon. The film brings it all to you , and I realized that this is what my quiet, peaceful, unassuming father had kept to himself all my life. It is a film that you will never forget; congrats to Mel Gibson on another directorial success. It's a must-see.",10,6,11,17 November 2016
