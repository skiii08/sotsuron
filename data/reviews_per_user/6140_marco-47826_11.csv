Changeling," Clint Eastwood is a mediocre director.
","I don't know why he's praised so much. His movies all look the same. Muddled. And the problem with this one is how overrated it is, through his and the actress he picked for the main part's success. Angelina Jolie. I never thought she was bad, but this movie proved me wrong. Here again, I can't understand the rage, and how she won awards for it. She was so bad it almost made me laugh. The storyline is in itself, not very captivating and a little disjointed at times. Especially during the commitment and trial parts, and yet I still managed to find the film too long. Or simply focusing on minor details, when it ends in a very rushed and abrupt way. Amateurish at best. Fortunately the rest of the cast was good, very good even (Malkovich comes to mind, obviously), and the depiction of 1920s not too stereotypical nor noir. Which I appreciated and prevented me from completely losing interest, when the investigation was struggling...",4,1,2,6 June 2020
Gremlins," It's a classic alright.
","One of the movies I used to watch as a kid, paired with the sequel, of course. I wonder if it's next in line to be banned, because the subtext is pretty clear and « offensive ». But who cares, anyway? It's entertaining, the perfect mix of horror and comedy, in 80s little blockbuster fashion. I wouldn't say it's a kids movie, because of the horror aspect that gets pretty intense sometimes. But everyone can enjoy it, and have a different interpretations of it, depending on your age and state of mind. It did age a lot, but it gives the movie a certain charm. It has a lot of similarities with Dante's previous work The Howling, through photography, music and atmosphere, even. But I often see it as one of Spielberg's on the side movie. My only complaint is that they made the movie too family friendly, and after reading the original script, I think it would've been better the way they planned it to be. Or not, we'll never know. All we know is how cult the movie can be, and still enjoyable after all these years. And that the sequel, is pretty good too.",7,1,1,10 June 2020
Green Room," I'm sorry, it's just awful.
","Unlikeable characters, making stupid decisions. Cliché vilains. I had a real hard time watching this mess of a movie. And I couldn't care less about what happened to any of these people, including the dogs. The script was nonsensical, some of the dialogue had me wondering why even bother? And the ending wasn't even justifying all the ruckus that happened throughout the movie.",1,1,4,12 June 2020
Lost in Translation," My favorite Sofia Coppola movie.
","It's almost as if we wish it never ends. But she makes sure to burst the bubble a little, before letting go of the journey. It has the perfect duo, and a very endearing love story. Wether it's platonic or filled with sexual tension, there's nothing creepy or uncomfortable about it. Despite the huge age gap between both protagonists. Played by the best choices the director could have ever made. Bill Murray is irresistible, and carries the comedic timing throughout the whole movie. Scarlett Johansson is both innocent and provocative, and really showed what a great actress she was about to become. Even Anna Farris cameos are gold. Personally, I'm not a big fan of Giovanni Ribisi, so I thought his character was the wallflower of the bunch. The Japanese actors gave great performances too, especially the one playing the call girl. She was hysterical. And that's where the other shoe drop. The stereotypical and ridiculous way these people are shown throughout the movie would be considered offensive, nowadays. And I really regret that. It's the point of the whole thing. Showing how completely different mentalities are there, compared to westerns countries. At least back then, they were. So overly sensitive people can hurt all they want. It's a great movie, and one that really deserved all the love and success.",9,0,0,24 June 2020
Bird Box," Birds were cute.
","And the acting pretty decent. Sandra Bullock brought me here. And she kept me here. Because I had no frikin' idea what I was watching. It started out good, in catastrophe movie fashion, with Sara Paulson guest starring, no less. Then it became just as boring as a season of the walking dead (FU fans). With actors/characters I more or less liked. After a lot of talk and pretty pointless characterizations, the showdown happened. First, in the flashback (which was one of the only parts I truly enjoyed, with the pre-apocalypse sequence at the beginning), and the current timeline, where the movie begun (which I didn't really enjoy or thought was captivating). And finally, the story concluded on a new age/religious underline, that was too predictable to be genuinely satisfying. This counting out the countless times the director tried desperately to move me, and such.
I thought it was somewhat entertaining, but mostly boring and plain. I haven't read the book, but I'm pretty sure it's better, and less drawn out. I hope...",3,2,6,22 December 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Everything that sometimes make a Tarantino movie unwatchable.
","People that philosophize about their boring lives. Attention to details only he can understand. Weird storytelling and directing. Lots of drawn out scenes, making the movie last longer than it should. Even the cast wasn't impressive or captivating. They just delivered their lines like it was rehearsal. So you don't get into the action either. It's a big fail alright, no wonder it wasn't very successful.",1,4,7,7 June 2020
Empire Records," For lovers of music and the mid 90s.
","The script is very light, and the characters are pretty stereotypical, but the feel is here, and some parts (musical interludes) are really good. No real complaints about the acting. The cast was mostly youngsters, so it didn't bother me. Like a teen version of Clerks, with the same offbeat ness, only it's not Clerks (hah!). And for once, the romantic aspect didn't take over the main plot. Only to be remembered at the end. I don't see the Breakfast Club parallel other users seem to find in the storyline. They are more or less friends and are already used to be amongst each other. So where is this coming from?... The movie aged a lot, and has MTV generation written all over. But it's a cool little time capsule of 90s music, fashion and even pop culture. Also, known actors made their debut there. So why not checking it out?",5,0,0,23 May 2020
From Dusk Till Dawn," Pretty awful.
","My teenage self is crying. This movie is terrible! I've been watching Tarantino movies lately, and I'm ashamed to admit it, half of it is unwatchable. And this movie is one of them. The only really good thing about it was the « twist », that would be really hard to keep secret these days, with strangers spoiling you everything on the internet. True Salma Hayek was gorgeous, and that dance... But most of the main cast was pretty bad. Tarantino, for starters, how more megalomaniac can you get? And George Clooney, who wasn't even good at being eye candy, let alone a believable bad boy. And had his fickle spotlight stolen during his scenes with Harvey Keitel, who was without a doubt, one of the upsides of the movie. Juliette Lewis and Kelly Preston did a good job too. And John Hawkes. Cameos at the pub weren't bad either. But it's the biggest problem with this film, once the twist happens, you know exactly what will happen, and who will survive. I didn't even finish rewatching. The special effects were too ridiculous and aged a lot. And before that you had the usual Tarantino style, with never ending chats, a certain stylish storytelling and the beginning of his foot fetish era. Which begs the question, is he simply overrated, and his vision too closed off? I think so, and it transpires too many times, in too many movies of his. This and the fact that, after trying this one again, I realized that only teenagers and young adults can appreciate most of his work. That's life...",3,0,1,16 June 2020
"Girl, Interrupted"," Very good movie.
","Beautiful even. And full of these ugly truths people deny or refuse to see these days. Winona Ryder carries it. And the rest of the cast help her do it. Of course Angelina Jolie is good, but she's not the best supporting actress. They all are, in their own way. After rewatching the movie, I wonder if they could make a TV show out of it. But like I said earlier, how, with all the « requirements » of today's entertainment? Still the movie remains, and it's better than nothing. I can't believe it's already 21 years old. Late 90s movies don't age, and have a very distinctive style, and certain charm. This movie is proof of it. Even setting in the 60s, it's timeless, through the music, fashion and photography. Too bad the reason it was so « successful » back then, were mainly mainstream, and not it genuine qualities. I almost forgot, there's a storyline, it's just built like an autobiography, that's all.",9,0,0,4 June 2020
The Happening," I'm speechless...
","What a dud! But I'm used to it coming from that director. I should've read the start credits more carefully. The story is interesting, but just like other people said. The execution is awful. And M. Knight Whatever, is mostly to blame for it. He just can't showcase his script and actors. The directing is appalling. I stopped counting the number of times I giggled or laughed hysterically at all the unintentionally funny moments in the movie. Betty Buckley's guest starring being the part where I completely lost it. The rest is just as embarrassing, but that was it for me. There is some good gore (?), but I would've rather have had a more compelling directing/acting, with actors that don't quote stupid lines, with eyes like a dead fish (Zooey, this is for you). Mark Wahlberg was the weakest lead ever. And the rest of the cast was either underused or badly used.
With a mystery that is literally going nowhere. The movie ends just as awkwardly as it went on for an hour or so. And the end credits start rolling.",2,1,2,8 June 2019
The Purge," Better than what they made of it afterwards.
","Good idea, good execution. I really don't get the bad ratings, who probably thought the sequels/series were better. I didn't. The thing I liked the most about this one, was the fact that the characters weren't straight out of a video game. They were human. The « good guys » I mean. In all this chaos, most characters managed to stay reasonable, and those who weren't, payed for it. And it was refreshing compared to most 2010s horror movies indulging in their lowest instincts. Ironically, this movie about letting people do immoral things for 12 hours, without any legal repercussions, had morals and a very satisfying ending. And the fact that it was a home invasion movie, following the struggle of a certain family, in this particular night. Rather than a faux documentary about a group of people who decided to kill or be killed, when they ended up on the streets, like the sequels. Was for the better I thought. I probably won't rewatch this any time soon, but I sure had a good time watching it.",8,0,1,3 November 2019
