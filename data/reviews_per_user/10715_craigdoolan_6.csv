Ford v Ferrari," Professional, well-made film with amazing look
","Firstly I should say that I'm not particularly a fan of motor racing, or aware at all of any of the story covered. Had it not been for the rave reviews, I wouldn't have sought this one out.The story itself is relatively straight forward, and the outcome not a particular surprise. This film could easily have fallen into mediocrity, however it just so well made. For the entire film, there barely seems a scene or a word out of place. On top of this, it looks amazing. I can't recall a film that, while not dealing with typically spectacular visuals, just looked so good.The acting is outstanding, especially Christian Bale, who gives I think his best performance, in a fantastically nuanced job. Matt Damon is good and the rest of the supporting cast generally spot on. Overall very highly recommended, one of the most professionally made films I've seen in a long time.",9,1,1,15 April 2020
Scarface," A good ride, but predictable
","Somehow I managed to miss this movie as part of my film education, and had never seen it until 2019, though was certainly well aware of it. Perhaps this is part of the reason for being a bit underwhelmed, as it does date a bit, and has been superceded by far better fare such as Goodfellas.The movie looks great, has been directed with real style by Brian DePalma. The performances are all good, though not outstanding. Pacino is incredibly intense and really inhabits Tony, however there's not much subtlety there. Michelle Pfeiffer is also a bit one-note, though she isn't given a lot (compare with Sharon Stone's knock-out performance in Casino).The music, by Giorgio Moroder, is often annoying and dates the movie badly, as well as detracting from the drama at times. It was a good ride, but the movie went pretty much exactly where you knew it was going to go, right from the start. It signposted all key plot developments well ahead of time. A good afternoon's entertainment, but not a classic.",7,0,0,28 October 2019
21 Jump Street," A pleasant surprise
","I can vaguely remember the original TV show from the late 80's (?) and fair to say I didn't go into this one with high expectations. What a surprise! A really funny film for the most part, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill play off each other beautifully and a good cast of supporting characters.The story pokes fun at the original concept, and the appearance of the original 21 Jump Street stars (including Johnny Depp) is a hoot. The only thing I didn't quite get was the abusive boss, played by Ice Cube, he's usually really good but this one didn't work for me.The movie slows a bit in the second half, and the attempts at mild melodrama fall a bit flat, but overall it's a pretty enjoyable ride.",7,1,1,11 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Not Tarantino's finest
","What the worst thing you could say about a Tarantino film? That it's mediocre. And for me, this is where this one sits. I'm a big Tarantino fan, always enjoy his movies, even if I find it frustrating that his self-indulgence stops them from being truly great.There's a lot of great things in this movie, it's full of style, good (though not great) performances, and usual sparkling conversation and writing one would expect of any Tarantino film. I was waiting for the pay-off in the second half of the film, and sadly it didn't really come - what's lacking here is a really carefully thought through plot line, where something actually happens.The film takes another interesting 'alternative history' approach, such as in (the much superior) Inglorious Basterds, which could have been really interesting, but doesn't really do a lot with it. I suspect if you weren't at least somewhat familiar with the story of Sharon Tate the movie would make even less sense (and be even less interesting).It's still better than 90% of the films released in 2019, but we expect so much more of QT, that it feels a bit of a letdown. So may of Tarantinos films I can watch again and again, I don't think this is one of them.",7,0,1,27 February 2020
Amadeus," A great story done well
","It was interesting to revisit this film after so long, it has aged really well. The whole concept of the movie is great, following the life of Mozart through the eyes of Salieri. Performances are bang-on, and while F Murray Abrahams walked home with the Oscar, I really enjoyed Tom Hulce as Mozart.The film looks great, fantastic costumes and design, and is directed with flair. The music is done really, really well, infused throughout the film to create drama. I found the narration by the elderly Salieri perhaps a bit too literal at times, I didn't need to be spoon-fed quite so much. The last hour also dragged a bit, with a bit too much time spent on the re-creation of some of Mozart's operas. That said, I was watching a Director's Cut, with an extra 20 minutes, so maybe the original version is a bit tighter.",8,0,0,29 October 2019
Born on the Fourth of July," Quality Vietnam War film
","I hadn't seen this movie for many, many years, probably not since it was a new release on VHS, so could remember little of my initial thoughts. It's probably fair to say I wasn't expecting a lot.Overall, a really pleasant surprise, much better than expected. It has aged well and the early performance by Tom Cruise is excellent. As an actor with somewhat limited range, this seemed just right for him, though I seem to recall it raised a few eyebrows at the time. I found it surprisingly moving, especially when he returns home and he, his family, and his local community, try to adapt to his new station in life.A few of the other characters could have been developed a bit more, Kyra Sedgewick seems a bit under-used and Willem Defoe, while entertaining, doesn't make a lot of sense. It also drifts a bit in the last half hour, if you didn't actually know the story, the wrapping up in the last five minutes would seem a bit rushed. This doesn't detract from the movie overall however, that sits quite nicely among the many other great films about the Vietnam War.",8,0,0,1 June 2020
