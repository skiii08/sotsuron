The Hangover," Forgettable comedy at best...
","Despite all the hype behind it, I did not go into The Hangover with anything but mild expectations. Was it funny? For the most part, yes. Was it laugh-out-loud funny? Not really, at least not for me. The premise is quite funny itself, but the jokes that follow were rather lackluster. It did shine in some aspects, I mean, it had modestly good performances. It just never really packed any kind-of punch one would think from a film like this. The characters don’t go anywhere either, only one person in the entire cast shows some growth and that was Stu (the dentist), the others are one-dimensional through and through. All in all, The Hangover was a decent comedy. I did laugh, but I never connected with the characters, and some of the situations seemed rather illogical – I know I should suspend some disbelief with a film like this, but I didn’t believe it warranted such a thing. It’s an okay film, but forgettable.",7,0,1,26 December 2009
500 Days of Summer," A movie worth falling in-love with...
","I’m not the biggest fan of romantic comedies, and I was a little weary of the film at first despite it having two leads I’ve grown up with over the years. I was charmed, I laughed, and (as corny as it sounds) it really is a feel-good film. I liked the approaches it took story-wise, and the style in which some things are conveyed. The chemistry between the leads is actually there, and not phoned-in by random celebrity A and B like in most romantic comedies. In fact, I don’t really know if 500 Days of Summer should be considered a romantic comedy. Sure, those two elements are there, but it delves into deeper meanings and its characters far more than some of the mainstream crap to come out this year. Overall, this is a really believable film, one that I really connected with and loved every moment of. It has its messages, and I laughed more in this film than I did with The Hangover. 500 Days of Summer is a smart film, and one of the few gems to have been released in 2009.",10,0,2,26 December 2009
Paranormal Activity," One of the decade's better, more original horror films...
","Horror is about as subjective as comedy. Some people prefer gore and slapstick instead of suspense and wit. With Paranormal Activity, anyone that's a fan of (or at least liked) The Blair Witch Project will probably like this. I found it to be an engrossing picture, but it isn't without mild flaws. The pace is off, and the scares are redundant. It has a great, albeit familiar, premise and the execution is very good. The performances are well done, I didn't hate or love the characters, but I did care for them (and I didn't find Micah annoying at all). Oren Peli does a great job a setting the atmosphere of the film, and anyone that likes 'fear of the unknown' suspense, then Paranormal Acitivity is a worthwhile adventure. I can see this film as one I'd pop into the DVD player to scare my children in future years.",8,2,6,29 December 2009
Avatar," One of the best films of the year...
","Rarely does Hollywood produce an epic, and rarely do they fall into capable hands. Not since The Lord of the Rings trilogy has there really been a satisfying epic that comes anywhere near the passion and ambition those films had, but Avatar comes damn close. It's not as strong as those films, but it does have strengths, as well as weaknesses.Are there flaws? Yes, but they're forgivable -- at least they were for me. The story and characters are very simple, and the former of the latter delves into familiar territory. However, despite this simplicity, the audience is given enough time to care for each character, especially when all hell breaks loose.James Horner’s the best he’s been in years. He does borrow from his past work, but honestly, if you haven’t listened to Horner’s previous scores, then you’re not missing out on much. There’s plenty of variety and complexity that makes this score soar when the action starts, and give beautiful growth for when we’re venturing around Pandora and having moments between the characters.The visual effects are certainly where Avatar succeeds on every level. The designs and execution are extraordinary. I first saw this in 2D (because, honestly, the film should be able to hold up in any format to be considered a film and not solely an experience), and even on the traditional screen, the visuals do nothing but make jaws drop. Cameron’s imagination is in perfect form here, and here’s hoping he does sequels.To me, the film never felt heavy-handed or hammy. Yes, some of the dialogue leans towards cheese, but it never becomes self-parody, maybe just a nod to the films of Cameron’s past. Despite the multiple parallels to the Iraq War, Blackwater, and Halliburton, this film was written over a decade ago, but these connections give Avatar a resonating power beyond the spectacle it already is.Even though Cameron the writer can undermine Cameron the director, he never loses us along this journey. There’s an immense buildup to the final third of the film, and Cameron’s attention to detail and storytelling more than allow the audience to gasp in awe at everything he pushes to the limit.The performances are well done. Stephen Lang stands out as the best of them all, he really does a great job at making Colonel Quartich one hell of a villain. Sam Worthington stole the show in Terminator: Salvation and he works that similar magic here. Zoe Saldana is also very intense and engaging in her role, especially when conflicts arise. Sigourney Weaver and Michelle Rodriguez were believable through and through; no one gave less than 100%.All in all, everything worked in Avatar for me. I love the look, and whenever the audience was supposed to cheer, I cheered. At work, those who’ve seen the film loved it, so I’m hoping this word-of-mouth continues at the box office so we get more sequels of this caliber (maybe even higher). Not since The Lord of the Rings has there truly been a worthwhile epic in any genre, and Avatar could shape up to be a juggernaut should there be a bright future for it.",10,45,75,24 December 2009
