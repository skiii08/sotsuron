The Avengers," Action only film about comic book superheroes uniting
","All I can say is I am stunned that this terrible movie has been given a rating above 2 or 3 by anyone. And to read this film grossed over $600MM makes me lack faith in the movie public. The Avengers has virtually no character development or plot. It basically is non stop chase scenes and things exploding, with an extreme amount of loud noise. I don't think there were more than several quiet, dialog times the entire movie. I kept thinking that the movie would settle down and get to a meaningful story, but it did not happen. I even was watching it in 3D but that did not help. If one wants to go see continual actions stunts and things exploding, then this is the movie for you. I am dismayed that so many people considered seeing this movie, based on the revenues, but then again, I was one of the victims too!",1,27,61,24 February 2013
The Intouchables," Incredible story about two improbable people finding true friendship
","This is a don't miss film if there ever was one! Any age will find this film to be one of the best films they have seen in years. Even teenagers, who typically only want to see action films, will be drawn to this film. One does not even remember the film was subtitled. This is the story of a quadriplegic who continually needs to find new caregivers because of how badly he treats them. He finally finds the most improbable candidate and hires him. This begins a fantastic and very funny relationship that kept me spellbound for the whole movie, as it did the entire audience. When it ended, the audience all clapped loudly. See this movie if you want to laugh a lot and if you appreciate the development of a true, unique friendship.",10,3,6,24 February 2013
