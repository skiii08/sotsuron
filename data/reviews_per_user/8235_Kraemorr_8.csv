Antz," Above-average computer-animation.
","Above-average computer-animated feature with loads of funny and witty dialogue by Woody Allen. Certainly not just for kids as the dialogue doesn't allow for it, nor do some violent scenes. Woodyphiles will enjoy this much more than kids as Woody Allen transcends into an ant for 90 minutes. Utter Enjoyment. 4/5",8,0,0,14 July 2001
Casablanca," Essential Viewing.
","Finally I get around to this, unfortunately I saw the colored version, but I'm not going to penalize a brilliant film just because a braindead moron got bored with B&W. I always thought this film as a sweet lovey-dovey romance, because old women always say how much they love it, but I was pleasantly surprised. This film is dark, cynical and irresistible, Humphrey Bogart is absolutely perfect and Ingrid Bergman is beautiful as always. Essential viewing for any serious film buff. 10/10",10,1,1,1 November 2001
Unbreakable," Shyamalan tries to remake the The Sixth Sense.
","Unfortunately Shyamalan tries to remake the The Sixth Sense, different story but he tells it exactly the same way as The Sixth Sense, it gets quite annoying near and at the end, but still recaptures the wonderfully strange atmosphere for the most of it. 7/10",7,0,0,30 October 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A Soapie in Space
","**Possible but unlikely spoiler**Well this sequel starts very well and is on par with IV and V for a lot of it, but gets more ridiculous and as it goes on and could of been called 'A Soapie in Space'. It also becomes too 'cute', I actually didn't mind the Ewoks but something told me they just didn't belong in a Star Wars film and how can Vader just turn like that, I could tell he was going to because this film did start becoming pretty predictable as soapies usually are. Shame.But they are the bad things, now the good things; for a film with those flaws it still was pretty entertaining and the rescue of Hans Solo in the beginning was certainly a highlight.This film with those flaws is still an enjoyable adventure that takes you along for a journey to a galaxy far, far away.7/10",7,0,0,2 June 2001
The Fast and the Furious," FAST
","Certainly fast and when it is, it is very entertaining, but when it isn't it's pretty typical of Hollywood. The drama in the film is very cliche. But finally a film promoted as rev-head film that actually has cars that chase and run and crash and drive underneath trucks, unlike a very disappointing Dominic Sena film I can think of. 7/10",7,1,1,17 September 2001
Lawrence of Arabia," Slows Down.
","Epic film is splendid for the first half, but slows down in the second half and almost to to a halt in the last quarter. But this film is still very watchable thanks to great acting, a brilliant score, excellent directing among other things. 8/10",8,1,3,30 October 2001
Meet Joe Black," Good handling of a risky film.
","Good handling of a risky film to make, 3 hours and doesn't really end up anywhere new, but like The Green Mile, it takes you on a journey, not a very compelling one, but definitely an entertaining one. Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Claire Forlani are just right for their roles and the film pretty much relies on them to break or make this film, and they make it, excellently. 8/10",8,1,1,30 October 2001
Rocky III," Fun, but not compelling.
","The third Rocky has Stallone deciding to keep boxing because of harassment from Mr. T. This fun but less compelling entry has its moments of enjoyment, but you can't stop thinking why he is even bothering with this loser in the first place. Has a great 80's song to help it along but unfortunately you're just not excited by the finale. The first two succeeded in their own little way, but this one falls a bit flat. 3/5",6,0,0,15 July 2001
