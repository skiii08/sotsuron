Blade Runner 2049," If the original was a 10 . . .
",". . . Blade Runner 2049 is a 6. Maybe 6.5 or 7. First of all, the mission of any sequel is to be as good or better than the original. Most fail, just as BR2049 failed to accomplish it's task. Without going into spoiling detail, let me just say that it was directed by one trying trying to be Ridley Scott. The score was written and performed by one (or twain) trying to be Vangelis. There is sincere flattery in their impersonation but it's not the Real Deal. The original Blade Runner was paced. You can't let a movie pace itself 2-3/4 hours without its seeming to drag. I watched this film because it was a Blade Runner sequel and they promised us Harrison Ford, which we got. Did I like BR2049? It was okay. Would I see it again? Probably, but not soon and NOT in a theater. And I'll probably buy a copy when it ends up in the Wal-Mart discount bin. I'll even throw in a guarded recommendation to those wondering if it's worth the admission. But if you love, love, loved the original Blade Runner you may be more reserved in your praise of this sequel. It is not the 10 star masterpiece some are making it out to be but neither is it the 1 star dog that others say it is.",6,9,21,6 October 2017
Mr. Nobody," Listen. Nemo Nobody had become unstuck in time.
","I've seen the title of this film on so many 'Best of . . .' lists I had to give it watch as soon as I ran across it. I was a bit dubious when during the opening credits it kept going on and on about how the film was a pan-European production. Was I facing two hours of subtitles? Fortunately, no. It was King's English throughout. I've never seen so many beautiful big-eyed human beings together in one place. The story was good, the filming was intriguing, dare I say surrealistic? No, I won't because the point of the film is that all choices in life are the correct ones. No matter what reality we experience, if reality it is, it is the correct reality and we, every nan jack of us, are playing our part in the right way at the right time. Even so, it doesn't mean our time on stage will be fun. there is love and the heartbreak caused by same; the is life; there is disappointment; there is tragedy and madness and death. The film contained contained the themes that make life worth living unless the life is TOO good; then it's just a bore. I want my. last words to be, 'Today is the happiest day of my life!' I hope I remember it at the right time and don't take too long to say it AND that there is some there to hear it. Is an uttered wisdom wise if there is no one to hear it?
I recommend Mr. Nobody even though I gave it a C+, six stars, because after two or three hours into the film I was ready for it to wrap things up but realized it was only half done.
This film is Billy Pilgrim meets Forrest Gump but that's not a bad thing as long as the director kept showing me interesting things and messing with my head. He got out of the groove an hour or so into the film but I was rooting for him to find it again and he did.
Nemo Nobody had a far better adolescence than I did. Good for him. The girls liked him and his terror of them was manageable, barely an inconvenience. I recommend Mr. Nobody to anyone with a bright mind willing to endure a bit of confusion to answer the question: What will happen next and is it really happening?",6,0,2,16 December 2018
Alien: Covenant," Not the crew of the Enterprise.
","I believe I could have given Alien: Covenant a couple more stars if the decisions made by the crew of the Covenant weren't so offputtingly bad. Persons in command make decisions best for the ship and its mission, not for altruism or charity. A REAL ship's captain would have abandoned the exploration team, with regret, and continued on the mission. And why was the captain endangering himself and the mission by going ashore? The away team should have consisted of three or four of the most expendable member of the ship's company. There would have been much more drama watching the person in charge making hard decisions and trying to solve problems rather than provide the Aliens an all-you-can-eat buffet. These space farers were not professional at all and could take a lesson from Capt. Picard.",5,2,3,21 May 2018
