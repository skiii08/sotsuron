Vertigo," Silly but beautiful
","I find it hard to admit, being a big fan, but this is the silliest Hitchcockian film I've seen and it strikes me why so many folk rate this is as possibly Hitchcocks masterpiece. For me the film is beautifully shot and flows from scene to scene so effortlessly but that's where the admiration ends.
Sadly though there are too many chronic plot holes and let's just start with chucking a doll off the bell tower? So Stewart's character (Scotty) accepted her death despite not checking the Madeline at the bottom was just a doll? Just to make it even more implausible, the authorities didn't even check.",3,3,10,7 July 2019
Skyfall," Worst bond movie ever?
","For me a resounding YES. Here's what I think are the main problems,1) Too much focus on M and for me she is useless in the role 2) Too much focus on Bond taking his top off. 3) Too much background music 4) Rubbish banter, you felt the actors were embarrassed to say some of the one-liners so the delivery was bad which made it worse. Mind you Roger and Sean would have just about got away with it. 5) Storyline was far too vague. 6) Film was far too long. 7) Poor Albert Finney - he was useless in this you get the feeling he just turned up to get some easy money. 8) Stunts were pretty average and the baddies were wooden. 9) Q is rubbishpositives;1) Dame M is dead 2) Got to see the DB5.",1,5,11,10 March 2013
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," robbish
","Will they have the nerve to make a third after this shower of crap ? Of course they will. The whole lot of them should be banged up for this diabolical release. 
I sensed a flop with Force Awakens so didn't expect them to turn it around.",1,1,2,29 December 2017
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A sensational blockbuster
","This deservedly swept the board in the 1958 Oscars ceremony.
A mesmirising film which gets better with every watch.
Guinness is sensational as the obsessive Colonel and he's joined by a top rate cast who do a fine job.
The film itself is beautifully shot and just adds to the realism.",10,2,2,29 February 2020
Scream," Only bettered by Nightmare on Elm Street
",You can't help thinking this movie is ridiculously dumb with the most clumsy knife welding killer of all time. However this is one of the appeals of the movie - it doesn't take itself seriously. Of course it also has it's creepy side and for me it contains several of the most terrifying slasher scenes of all time. It has elements of all the slasher movies that went before it but it takes these ideas further or improves on them making it original in it's own right. With it's scooby do script and relentless pace this is a stonewall classic. Keeps me gripped more than the dated Halloween and is almost on par with the classic Nightmare on Elm Street. Has to be 10/10.,10,0,0,4 October 2014
