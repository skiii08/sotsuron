Mission: Impossible III," A Little Less Conversation...
","...A little more action. That's the philosophy of this series and genre. I just wish the chatter-heads who puke up their hysterical mind-chum in these reviews would take a cue from the objects of their juvenile obsessions and save the tedious epics that they spew up as opinion for their personal blogs. This is a good space to give a brief comment on your reaction to this particular movie. Not a manifesto on the historical and societal relevance of male hero worship in the post-post modern, pre-apocalyptic, retro-conservative era. Its a great series. Goofy Cruise is mesmerizing and the overblown action is riveting. On a bet, I would yell fire in the theater where MI3 is showing and I'm sure no one would budge. Burn, baby, burn...",8,0,1,19 May 2006
Fight Club," What do YOU think? Who Cares, Shut up.
","The most entertaining movie of the decade, blowing away some very heavy hitters, like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Shawshank Redemption, Goodfellas, The Usual Suspects, The Matrix, and dozens of others including Fincher's own Se7en. Fincher learned a whole lot after Se7en, which I thought was clunky, corny, and obvious. Fight Club is a constant revelation, never for an instant giving away it's intent or purpose till the very very end, and even then it still messes with ya. How many times have I watched it? I dunno - 10, 15 - it doesn't matter, there's always another brilliant detail, another spectacular insight to be admired. Nothing feels as good as a vicarious thrill, where we don't have to deal with the consequences of irresponsible, impulsive behavior. Fight Club is the ultimate vicarious thrill, and damn fine film making as well. It's absurdly remarkable, magically horrendous, and awfully unique. Fight Club artfully reflects our crumbling, decaying society and the outdated, selfish philosophy that guides it. Apparently, we are all so f%#@ed. I am not gay - as far as my history reveals - but I would SO bang Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden. You know you would too, you filthy liars. Like Tyler, 'Fight Club' dares you to ignore it, taunts you into engaging with it, then mercilessly mocks you for acknowledging it. That's the only rational tactic, it seems, that might actually work to wake up our drowsy, dopey, deluded population. Maybe. I'm predisposed to embrace counter culture, anti-materialistic, anarchistic jargon so this stylish rant flowed right into my receptive psyche like cool clear gasoline. Soon after seeing it I quit my stupid corporate job, burned some hefty bridges, and began trying to find a better way.I may never achieve any kind of socially admirable status, never impress anyone with an enviable accumulation of manufactured items, never be cited for having plainly and obviously contributed to 'the effort.' And that's cool, as long as I don't have to explain myself to any of the rapidly multiplying legions of mindless sheep that assemble dutifully every day to have their throats slashed.

The Maze Runner," Sometimes Exciting but Usually Annoying
","There's a lot of visually interesting action sequences that are quite effective even for being completely CGI created, and some of the acting is above average, especially the three lead boys, but the dialog is often corny and even boring. More importantly, the story makes little to no sense--why couldn't the adults running the 'experiment' just put the boys in computer simulated tests?! There's absolutely no good reason for the boys--and one girl--to have to actually endure all the terrifying nightmare violence and horrific deaths of their fellow captives. The explanation by the Director for why the boys were in the Glade and Maze is just so completely illogical and silly and stupid. Some kids will love this movie if they're the sort that doesn't question movies--or things--too deeply or if they're easily entertained by shallow, visually stimulating spectacles. Personally, I prefer a more intelligent, better thought out story, and I think a lot of kids do, too.",5,1,1,26 February 2016
Hostel," It's So Much Worse Than It's Trying To Be.
","I don't want to spend too much of my time or energy on this review because this terrible movie doesn't deserve even the 24 words I've already typed. Slasher films historically were low budget, inconsequential forgettable nonsense that Hollywood depended upon to bring in just enough teenage cash to cover their costs and maybe help finance another more creative, worthy endeavor. But Hostel actually aspires to something more. It actually has lofty ideals, and it sincerely strives to be profound. It wants to be taken seriously. And that's the sickest, most depraved aspect of a film that has no moral or ethical qualms about plunging to the lowest depths of depravity in its quest to shock the most unshockable, desensitized, deadened generation of film goers ever. Director Eli Roth has exquisitely exploited the most modern technological cinematic methods in crafting his damaged, deranged Frankenstein of a film. It barely lives in any human sense. It lurches and lumbers like a lobotomized linebacker, slowly and deliberately strangling the life out any sentient being in its path. By the last half hour I felt so ashamed and so disgusted to be in the same species as the wretched creature that contrived this horrendous mistake. It's just so deeply, sadly, desperately sick. Just like the deeply, desperately sick society that would ever consider this mess to be anything else but a complete tragic abortion.So maybe Hostel is deep and profound in that regard, the way it reflects just how hopelessly corrupt is our culture and how it's all coming to a horrible, grisly end so much faster than anyone cares to imagine. The feeling of helpless despair I have for our poor, crippled world I also feel for the makers and fans of this poor, crippled film.",1,1,3,8 February 2012
Match Point," Woody Allen's Stunning Film Noire Tribute to Stanley Kubrick
","Woody Allen is fond of quoting other great artists, and often includes samples, snippets and glimpses of their work in his own. For Match Point, a very sly subtle murder thriller, you would think his inspiration must be Hitchcock. Or maybe Dostoevsky. Or F. Scott Fitzgerald. Or possibly even himself. You'd be wrong. Dead wrong. The most direct influence this time is the great Stanley Kubrick whose classic Eighteenth Century period piece Barry Lyndon sets a clear model of high style and languid pacing. Kubrick's sprawling tale of an Irish commoner—whose fate is no more determined by his own ambitions than it is by sheer arbitrary luck—luxuriates in visual splendor. Woody, too, lavishes great attention on the continual procession of impeccable London locales and rambling country estates, and on the stunningly attractive characters who inhabit them. Scarlett Johansson's radiant beauty, Woody seems to suggest, is reason enough to film her. When she's on screen everything is suddenly so intensified, so much more visceral. She may have a clumsy delivery and often awkward physicality, but her voluptuous contours and magnificent face mercilessly seduces the camera. Likewise, her counterpart, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, possesses a face engineered for film. His full sensual lips echo Scarlet's, as if implying that their ill fated lives are not only metaphysically preordained, but also genetically inevitable.Kubrick, himself a native New Yorker (Bronx) who transplanted himself to England in 1961 to work independent of the Hollywood nonsense, enjoyed film simply for its own aesthetics. He took excruciating care in composing, lighting and staging his scenes and the results are often breathtaking moments of cinematic art. Woody saw in Barry Lyndon an enviable standard of indulgent visuals, and like his own masterpiece homage to his cherished hometown, Manhattan, he spared no effort in capturing iconic views and vistas of posh London and the Arcadian countryside. While Kubrick's tale meanders for over three hours, Woody has limited his to just two, but even this modest length out lasts his usual film by a full thirty minutes. This extra half hour Woody invests in both developing well rounded complex lead characters, and also reveling in the often spectacular country landscapes. Some viewers will undoubtedly find fault with the intentionally thinly drawn support characters—more elegant props than actual personalities—but this contrivance only heightens the allegorical quality of this severely morbid morality tale.It moves along gracefully at first, gently developing a hypnotically pulsing rhythm that gradually builds and quickens as the predicament surprisingly grows dire. After a series of exceptionally well paced set pieces confidently establishing the form that this thrill ride will take, it eventually, inexorably, explodes into a frantic, feverish fit of mayhem. Upon reflection I realized that there's an awful dread that haunts most of this film—a palpable evil presence—that Kubrick would be proud of. And Hitchcock, too, for that matter. The crime is utterly ghastly, unspeakably horrible, and all the more shocking for the early languorous pace. This is a Woody Allen few, if any, fans will recognize. For this one he has fully unleashed the dark demon that he only tentatively brandished in his earlier similar tale of spiritual nihilism, 1989's Crimes and Misdemeanors. The sin in that one was second hand, distant, and therefor rather abstract and theoretical. But in this deeply sinister picture, the transgression is total and absolute; the hands of the killer are now intimately near the heart and soul of the protagonist. Allen has built an even more confining cell for his monstrously guilty prisoner, but ironically, outrageously, horribly, he also has also entrusted him with the keys. It's so disturbing, this story. It's utterly bleak.The final paradox of this jet black film is that the one to which it owes it's greatest debt was in the end Kubrick's least disturbing, most gentle, most buoyant creation. In Barry Lyndon there's the occasional gentlemanly duel, the odd minor war injury, or the temporary pang of unrequited desire, but virtually no gore, menace, or mayhem. Woody's Match Point, however, is the most darkly chilling horror he has ever conjured. It's a shiver to the marrow that grows deeper and darker.",9,0,2,24 February 2011
The Prestige," Illusion In The Service Of Great Story Telling
","The art of prestidigitation is an apt metaphor for the contrived artifice of cinema. Christopher Nolan, like the master magicians depicted here, is intent on capturing our attention & imagination with his very skillful cinematic sleight of hand. And then in his bid for recognition as the ultimate showman, he risks his entire production on our natural human inclination to WANT to be deceived. He nudges & prods us into accepting this - our complicity in this deception - and then proceeds to taunt us for it. He smugly shows us the props & tools of his nefarious trade, and still he gains our confidence. As he entrances us with his magical visions we hand over to him our faith - and our cash. That's Hollywood, folks.This film is essentially a mystery thriller that is doubly confounding because we are continually being reminded that everything we are witnessing may well be an illusion. We are repeatedly put on notice that our perception of the film's reality is to be doubted, and therefor the reliability of the actions & identities can only be highly suspect. Yet we are compelled to persist in our assumptions, our suspicions, as Nolan is quite masterful at charming us deeper into his ploy. Just past the mid point of the film I became aware that I was being set up for an exceptionally confounding deception. And so I doubled my intense analysis & scrutiny of every action, of every character, of every word, intent on detecting a clue to the approaching 'twist.' I am not embarrassed to say that I did not figure it out. I was damn surprised by the very clever, very ingenious gimmick that is finally revealed. Only because the set up was so wonderfully watchable do I not resent this film's blatant manipulations. Just as you must respect, ultimately, anyone who fairly outsmarts you, I tip my hat to Christopher Nolan. And I am STILL not completely sure of what I witnessed.Hugh Jackman is a true Hollywood star and plays Robert Angier, an ambitious magician who competes with an old counterpart, Alfred Borden, for the title of finest in the land. Jackman's mere presence illuminates the screen, and he easily handles his character's subtle shifts in mood and tone. Christian Bale as his professional and then personal arch enemy certainly had the more challenging, less attractive role but somehow manages to maintain our sympathy. Michael Cain as Cutter, their one time boss and mentor is, as always, wonderfully natural & convincing. David Bowie, who previously seemed to always be playing a slightly grander version of his already expansive self, is here surprisingly low key and centered. He role was a fun, recurring element. But the women are a little less remarkable in their portrayals, as Scarlet Johansson's reading is often muddled and unfocused. She is, however, absolutely stunning to watch, her voluptuous curves and magical face seemingly created expressly for the big screen. Rebecca Hall as Alfred's put upon but loving wife is quite compelling despite her somewhat underwritten, sometimes clichéd role. As we are so emphatically informed at the outset of this fanciful con, the real trick, the real Prestige of a magical illusion is in bringing back the disappeared object or person. So, thus warned, I was eagerly anticipating the magical return of a vanished element. What or who should we expect to be returning is the persistent question that this film begs. And just as consistently, it foils and thwarts your every guess. The Prestige is remarkably effective at raising the bar on the challenge of openly conceding to us cinema's deviously dubious nature, while still dazzling us with its superior artistry.",9,0,0,2 October 2011
The Godfather: Part II," If A Greek Philosopher Directed A Gangster Movie . . .
","I secretly read Mario Puzo's The Godfather in 1974 when I was 12 after my mother prohibited me from seeing the movie. She was trying to shield me from the rough language and lurid violence. There sure was a lot of both but more so there were great characters. Vivid, real, flesh and blood souls that acted on well drawn impulses and ambitions. Consequences were openly inevitable but somehow jarring, devastating and poignant. Historical elements were stunningly precise yet grandly broad and vast. I was entirely, absolutely overwhelmed by the visceral sensations and sprawling imagery. So this is what 'literature' is all about. This is what 'reading', I now understood, could be. I had been something of a sci-fi junkie previously, but from then on I was a converted disciple of the Great American Fable. The story was truly great and I never could have imagined a better one until I finally saw the movies.Astoundingly, Francis Ford Coppola's film adaptations surpass the novel in a few key details. The casting of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is the single greatest improvement on the original story. Where in the novel, Michael is something of a strapping, virile, obviously competent man of action, Coppola introduces a crucial element of doubt by way of Pacino's diminutive stature. Though we are told Michael is a returning war hero, we are skeptical of his leadership abilities, especially in the company of such physically imposing figures as his father and oldest brother Sonny. Pacino's bodily disadvantage works to emphasize the complexities of his reluctance to join in the Family Enterprise, and makes his cerebral and emotional challenges that much more epic.The other notable improvement on the book, of course is Marlon Brando, who created one of the most indelible characters for the big screen. There wasn't then, nor is there now, any other person in the industry who could so monumentally fulfill the herculean task with which that character is charged. Don Vito Corleone's function in the story is metaphorical, transcendent, mythological. He is the living embodiment of the ageless value of Heritage. Heritage which only endures through the tenuous bonds of family unity, but transported to a young, naive, unsympathetic land, is now being severely tested. But since Godfather II begins after the Don is dead it is faced with the considerable challenge of how to maintain this crucial historical perspective. So, Gf 2 immediately whisks us back into time with a vignette of Vito's tragic childhood in turn-of-the-century Sicily. Later begins a series of flashbacks to his early manhood in New York City played by a sublimely low key Robert DeNiro. Oddly, he is not engaged in acts of wanton destruction, sociological delinquency or self indulgent pride. Rather, we are casually informed of Vito's entry into the underworld by way of seemingly reasonable acts. He is drawn as a man not just doing what is necessary to survive in the rough, often brutal New World, but driven by his familial responsibilities and a sense of duty to his community. The period from which we are 'flashing' is the late 1950s and early 1960s. By butting the 'old' up against the 'new' we are offered a sparkling view of the clash of cultures, of just how much had changed in those few decades. This dichotomy introduces a two fold historical perspective. By way of the contrasts between early and mid century life we are being informed of our present day (1972 and after) cultural afflictions. It's a subtle, almost invisible point, but one that is, I believe, extremely profound, the central theme of the story, and even more relevant today. Consider how, just one single decade after the time when the story ends to when the films were made, American life had so radically changed. Now consider how much things have changed since then.While most fans of the film are impressed with the robust characters, compelling dialog and and terrific action produced with expert cinematic skill, I was even more fascinated by the film's more abstract qualities. Coppola, much more so than Puzo, is playing Socrates here, posing a dialectic query - How is it that primal cultural tenets might survive in a climate of overwhelming opposition? Francis is troubled, alarmed by the assault on vital culture that all humanity is experiencing today, and obviously very cynical that cherished and valuable, essential traditions can persist. This cynicism was a pervasive theme at the close of the sixties and it infused nearly all the great art of the time. Remember, the year of the book's publication, 1969, also saw the release of 'Easy Rider.' Not insignificantly, that too was a story of social outsiders, antiheroes colliding with an increasingly corrupt, immoral majority. This cynicism is the intellectual, psychological and emotional driving force of the The Godfather I & II, and it's the thing that kept me coming back to them, again and again. So, what for many is simply a superb, if not the greatest, Gangster Movie, is for me one of the finest critical views of the American Way. It is, in fact, irrelevant that the Corleones are mobsters, because ultimately what destroyed them is what is destroying all Americans. The disintegration of the essential commitment to family and community - our succumbing to all the temptations that undermine our strengths - is our downfall. It's no coincidence that the tragedy ultimately concludes in Las Vegas, the spiritual center of America's true religion, the Capitol City of Temptation. Our cultural decline has progressed to where it is now terminally incurable. Great art in the service of a dying society. We have all become Fredo.",10,6,11,18 March 2010
Apocalypse Now," Fighting Insanity with Insanity
","This comment is for the original cut, Not the Redux version.The myth of the 'Good War' still persists, that there can be nobility in the horrendous acts committed in the service of Right. Francis Coppola took upon himself the task of exploring and refuting this notion, and found entry into this harrowing terrain by way of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness.' In the novel, commercial interests drive the British empire into the depths of the African jungle, and just as deeply into Britian's own severely corrupted soul. The ambitions of a 'civilized' people have supplanted all notions of decency, Christianity, humanity. In the novel the inescapable corrupting force is the savage ivory trade. The African natives have been reduced to dispensable pawns, fortunate to receive even the most brutal treatment from their colonial masters. This horrendous industry supports a contentedly oblivious Empire. In the film it's the Vietnam war that inexorably disfigures all its participants. And for the great director, the irresistible flame of destruction is his film. Coppola's river of decent became Time, as a projected 15 week shoot in the jungle sprawled to more than 250 grueling days. Repeatedly prolonged by an ongoing brutal guerrilla war, severe monsoon weather, and the near fatal heart attack of Martin Sheen, the shoot evolved into a treacherous marathon, pushing everyone involved beyond their limits. In the film the character of Kurtz functions as the ideal civilized fighting man: educated, decorated, refined, virile, charismatic, brilliant, formidable. In the novel and perhaps more importantly, Kurtz is an artist; 'essentially a great musician,' a journalist, a skilled painter, and 'a universal genius.' Coppola, too, is something of a universal genius; a larger than life character of enormous talents and capacities. Though we are ostensibly given access to his personal beliefs through the narrations of Capt. Willard, I suspect that Francis more deeply identifies with Kurtz. After all, Coppola had in fact become a renegade demigod leading a ragged army in the jungle, defying all authority, ruthlessly executing his own brand of creativity. Studio execs like to consider themselves Highly Principled Creatives. But, in the face of Francis' truly uninhibited, honest excesses they proved themselves to be timid sheep by cutting his budget. They had been complicit in creating the monstrous ego of Coppola and had profited hugely with his 'Godfather' franchise. But they lost their nerve when they saw what was reflected in the bizarre mirror that Francis was assembling in that Philippine jungle. There were more than a few Studio execs that wanted the director terminated with extreme prejudice. This is perhaps the film's most salient point; that the Enterprise can only be corrupt because its Sponsors are corrupt. And more so, the Sponsors are further corrupted by the Enterprise. Vicious cycle. In the film the home office honchos wanted Col. Kurtz dead because his actions were revealing to them the folly of their own ways. Proof of their depravity is their need to have a great American soldier assassinated. As for Coppola, the Studio was embarrassed by the accurate picture he was painting of their industry; bloated, self-serving, and unprincipled.Francis commented at the film's Cannes preview that its production was so overwhelming that '(it) is not about Vietnam, it IS Vietnam.' The herculean effort is evident in every frame. Not an instant passes without a heightening sense of ominous doom. Each klik up the Mekong into Cambodia is a slowly tightening tourniquet on the throat, breath barely moving over dry lips. The aerial battle scenes are absolutely the most grandly choreographed tableaux of grace and destruction ever put to film; an utterly Grotesque Opera. Everything is over-sized, disproportionate, absurd. And most disorienting of all is Brando, himself. Col. Kurtz (kurtz is German for short) is ill, weakened, compromised, but Brando's creation manages to tower above all else. He seems to be very gently rocking in a wind; a massive ancient sequoia listing to and fro on the verge of a mighty, awesome collapse. Brando/Kurtz is doubly mesmerizing because we only glimpse him in deep shadows and stark profiles. Accounts of the shoot explain that Brando arrived on location at nearly 300 pounds and felt very self conscious of his size, so Francis devised the high contrast lighting to conceal and appease the star. It's a fortuitous concession because it only magnifies his intense psychological presence. It's as though Kurtz is played by the spectre of Brando.War has long been a compelling topic for films. The visual spectacle and pyrotechnics serve the film medium well. The eternal theme of good versus evil is elegantly displayed against a backdrop of chaos and mayhem. The poignant interplay of suffering and sacrifice, the glory of selfless duty to a country that has our best interest at heart. What 'Apocalypse Now' attempts is the complete negation of these values. These outdated ideals are so hollow, so feeble compared to what the tender human mind experiences under the influences of war. There is nothing good in war. There is nothing good as a result of war. Even when participation becomes necessary, there is nothing to be gained from war but loss. And what is most lost is our sanity, our humanity. Kurtz's 'Horror' is not of what he has witnessed in country, but in the hypocrisy of Society and the behavior of the 'Civilized'.(Important Note: Redux is valuable as an example of how important good editing is. It contains additional scenes that help flesh out the history of Vietnam and the conflict, and attempts to make more human the star characters, but succeeds only in disrupting the rhythm and flow of the original masterpiece. The specifics of the Vietnam war are irrelevant to the larger theme of 'War's' madness, and feels like a detour. Making Capt. Willard more personable only undercuts the tension that builds along his 'journey' up the river. See the original cut first.)",10,4,5,27 May 2009
In the Name of the Father," Amazing View of The Troubles
","Totally Surprising. Not at all what I expected from the subject and previews. It could have been a clichÃ©d exploitation of a complicated horrible situation, but rather is exceptionally subtle, nuanced and original, and therefore, very powerful. Some people comment that it plays a little loose with facts, some of which are not so minor. That the film makes no mention of Gerry Conlon's possible, if doubtful, ties to the IRA does change things a bit. Including that info would only have made the film better, more subtle. But its omission does help us to see Gerry Conlon as unjustly accused, tortured and convicted, avoiding the distraction of our suspecting him a criminal terrorist. Daniel Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaithe are riveting as living, breathing, flesh and blood characters, almost bigger and better than the story itself. As a period piece, it recreates the turbulent '70s vividly, while it constantly fascinated me with its British take on the Generation Gap. If you need to remind yourself what great film-making is all about, this is a first choice.",10,0,0,18 September 2006
Wreck-It Ralph," A Visual Feast with a Generous Helping of Clever Wit and a Big Scoop of Genuine Heart
","The visual splendor alone of every scene, of every frame, elevates this modest but heartfelt film to classic status, but it's the inspired storytelling which truly distinguishes this tribute to those innocent days at the very dawn of our video game saturated culture. Easily one of the most clever, entertaining and satisfying children's computer animated films I've ever seen, up there with the Toy Story trilogy, Wall-E, the Incredibles, and Finding Nemo. Like Toy Story and Wall-E, Wreck-It Ralph relies on a very potent mix of bittersweet nostalgia for a bygone age and an acid sharp cynicism for an increasingly uncomfortable future. The result is an endlessly endearing cautionary tale warning us to be wary of the myriad increasingly complex and seductive technological innovations which are threatening to overwhelm us with their irresistible electronic magic. That's a dicey position for a computer generated film to take and it acknowledges its own potential hypocrisy with some very astute and hilarious self deprecating humor. The movie is also saved from descending into self parody on the strength of the very fine performances of its leads. John C. Reilly's naturally affable manner imbues Ralph with a nuanced blend of restrained self pity and emphatic hopeful pride, enriching his character with genuine humanity. And Sarah Silverman is a shear delight as the quick witted pixie faerie who blithely coaxes and goads Ralph to fulfill his destiny as savior of their realm. Pixar's Toy Story is the original classic computer animated film and rightfully lays claim to the title as Champion of the form, and Pixar's Wall-E certainly upped the stakes with its positively mature and sophisticated theme of catastrophic environmental abuse by an increasingly contented and oblivious populace, but Disney's Wreck-It Ralph achieves greatness by virtue of its unbounded love for its subject and the infectious joy with which it's brought to life. Effervescent glee bursts from every detail. Wreck-It Ralph cheerfully destroys all resistance on its whimsical mission of mass appeal.",9,3,4,12 July 2014
Gone Girl," It Thinks It's a Smart Satire But It's Mostly a Flimsy Farce
","Ben Affleck has a few compelling, convincing scenes where his boyish innocence and modest charm are exploited to considerable effect, as though daring me to believe anything coming out of his mouth. Rosamund Pike's performance is much more ineffectual and troubling; Miss Pike is clearly just as new to and unfamiliar with the character she's playing as we are. Rather than eliciting profound wonder at the impossibly fickle and treacherous mystery that is the scorned female psyche, Pike's portrayal only manages to provoke some mild ire and a lot of disbelief. I simply couldn't tolerate what that scheming spouse--as well as the rest of this dumb movie--was demanding of my patience. Too much, man.The production values are sufficiently high that its appearance and soundtrack are both fairly seductive. I was drawn in more by the luxury of their lives than through the lead characters' personalities. Almost right from the start I wasn't buying what this disingenuous and manipulative film was emphatically, desperately selling.I was initially interested, mildly, with how this lumbering, plodding schlock fest would resolve itself only because I quickly became aware that it would require a tremendously skillful and tactful twist to bestow any sort of honor upon itself, but no, it merely continues to lamely drone on and on, wallowing in its own inflated sense of importance. It's a clunky, corny, spastic, tone deaf, silly sham of a cinematic experience. If you're entertained or even amused by this overly clever, self fascinated triviality then that says some pretty unappealing things about you. Perhaps you enjoy being cynically conned and openly mocked? Me, not so much. Sitting through this too-ridiculous-by-a-half stunt of a film is more daunting than actually being married to the cunning manipulative psychopath into which Rosamund Pike's stoic anti-hero methodically morphs. 'You're delusional!' Ben Affleck's outwitted, out maneuvered husband accuses his crafty spouse, as though the thought hadn't already occurred to us. He complains that their relationship has become something very bad, something very nasty--I dunno exactly, I stopped paying much attention by that point--and she replies so mechanically 'That's marriage.' Wow, hysterical. Or not. Who knows, or cares. Not me.",3,4,6,5 January 2016
The Elephant Man," A Wondrously Gorgeous Monster Movie
","This is a very early film in Lynch's professional career, his 1st major studio production following his much more personal, intimate and outrageously bizarre masterpiece, Eraserhead. That freshman effort is perhaps Lynch's most pure expression of cinematic artistry—a fiercely idiosyncratic, absurdly inscrutable gesture of audio/visual mischievous of the most masterful kind. Contained within Lynch's debut feature length movie can be found the bulk of the sublime ideas and ingenious cinematic techniques which infused all his later films with such shockingly vivid & visceral emotionalism. Eraserhead is such a powerfully effective bit of cinematic wizardry that upon witnessing it—no, upon being assaulted by it!—Mel Brooks was convinced that its mad genius creator had to be the director of the unusually odd film which he was producing, and thus David Lynch was hurled into the gaping, yawning, voracious orifice that is Hollywood film-making. Luckily, David Lynch had a magnificently talented cast (Anthony Hopkins, John Gielgud, Anne Bancroft, Freddie Jones, and of course a brilliant John Hurt) as well as a superb script (Christopher De Vore, Eric Bergren & David Lynch) with which to fashion his quaint Victorian period piece/archly Gothic nightmare monster movie. The narrative is strikingly concise and terse, almost bleak in its unadorned simplicity, yet more than ample to support the gargantuan mass of barely tolerable pathos which burdens nearly every scene. That's not to say it's a tortuous slog—no, not hardly. The Elephant Man is only as emotionally crushing as David Lynch has astutely calculated we can endure, and it regularly assumes a surprisingly delicate & buoyant demeanor. In other words, it's an intensely disturbing, wonderfully rich & rewarding emotional roller coaster. Lynch's monster is a ghastly creature dwelling in the darkest, dankest recesses of the human psyche, and it's by dragging us kicking & screaming down to those formidably threatening depths that he's able to then kindly usher us to the shimmering splendor of an equally remote but welcoming inner realm where resides compassion, empathy & genuine humanity. It seems it's only by directly facing life's most daunting, most ugly, most horrific truths can we hope for any real joy, or at least any relief. That's heavy, isn't it?",9,1,1,23 October 2017
The Game," I haven't watched it yet, but I bet it's good. Not Great, but good.
","How can I declare that 'The Game' will be good, but not great, before I have seen it? By reading other people's comments. The common theme of most of these comments is that 'The Game' is a clever, if outrageous, fantasy driven by fine performances from its stars, Michael Douglas - who I have always found to be engaging and believable - and Sean Penn, who is often very effective, but can also be overly theatrical and oddly self conscious. Somehow Sean manages to convey intense discomfort and boundless confidence simultaneously. It's actually kinda weird. In fact, I find Sean to be a weird person - a curious mix of contradictions and clichés. He rails against the abuse and despoliation of our natural wilderness, but he smokes cigarettes furiously. He demands to be acknowledged as a gifted profound artist, but is keen to develop his persona as an 'everyman.' If he ever manages to stop 'acting' - whether in a film, or while being interviewed, or on the location of the latest natural disaster - he suddenly becomes powerfully effective, but those moments are few and far between. He too often comes across as self centered and smug. That's a problem with emotionally fragile personalities - they're afraid to just be themselves.OK, so now I've trashed Sean Penn without having yet seen his performance. No doubt we can all agree that prejudice is a shameful vice, so I should probably refrain from any more blind conjecture, but this is my dilemma. Should I risk 129 minutes of my so very(?!?) valuable time on a Sean Penn vehicle, wagering that I haven't once again been duped into a another frivolous disappointing distraction? It's a risk, it seems, I'm willing to take if the overall experience is something that at least rates as 'pretty good.' If I'm right about my hunch on this flick then I'll leave this comment intact after I watch 'The Game.' If I'm wrong, then I'll add a note correcting my premature condemnation. Maybe I'll be back, maybe not. It's up to Sean...",7,0,1,9 December 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Only 12 Minutes In and I'm Completely Impressed
","I've just barely gotten into it but already the very clever script, sensational soundtrack, and gorgeous visuals have won me over. The contemporary use of black and white in films is often a cue that something sincere and artful is being attempted, and within moments of it's opening frame I was reassured that my critical attention would be rewarded. As Sig Mickelson (Jeff Daniels) is introducing Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) to a banquet room of elegantly attired news media elite, the camera settles on the off stage shadowed profile of the acclaimed newsman, his head bowed slightly, the intensity of his mood made evident by the back lit dragon breath cigarette smoke streaming from his nostrils and mouth. This transcendent moment establishes a quality that bodes well for the remainder of the film, and sets a lofty standard to which all films should aspire. Magically, I was made to predict - to understand - exactly what it was that Murrow was about to proclaim to, and stun, the attentive audience; my own powers of reason and intuition had been expertly recruited as sympathetic combatants in this symbolic war of ideals. I have just experienced cinematic poetry of the highest order that could very possibly be mistaken for extremely subtle propaganda. Or vise versa! Bravo, Grant Heslov and George Clooney for brandishing the double edged sword of paradox. I have just been graciously reassured that this stylish tale will in no way be an unremarkable obvious cliché.Esthetically, George Clooney as Fred Friendly is certainly a bit of a stretch, but so far he's convincing as Murrow's similarly principled co-conspirator. I've just been introduced to Robert Downey Jr.'s and Patricia Clarkson's characters and they're sensational, and I look forward to seeing more of their nuanced performances. Frank Langella as William Paley, the burdened head of network, is the epitome of restrained arrogance. And Ray Wise as the ill fated Don Hollenbeck has just made his first appearance with his usual inspired excellence. Can this get any better?I'm now going to resume watching, confident that the ensuing historical recreation/fictional contrivance is the product of enlightened, inspired, sensitive, generous, and talented minds. That's a great way to feel at the beginning of a movie, and it's the only way to be when confronting what might be art. If the remainder of the film somehow fails to fulfill the high promise of these initial scenes, I will be thoroughly shocked. In fact, I'm more than confident that I won't be returning here to this comment later to correct the following statement. This is one of the finest films I have experienced in many, many years, and is equaled by a scant few in this twenty first century. No doubt, I'll be watching and enjoying this very fine film more than once.",9,0,0,11 May 2010
Mulholland Drive," The Rosetta Stone To David Lynch's Mind, Amazing...
","Puzzles can really tie up your mind. After hours, days, years of toiling to resolve a conundrum you may abandon it, defeated. But a good puzzle - a truly great one - will always beckon you back mercilessly. After first experiencing Mulholland Drive in 2001 I was completely baffled. Had the 2 1/2 hours of cinematic hysteria merely been a hoax? A highly stylized scam? Could it be that this confounding, bewildering pantomime of Classic Hollywood tropes only been contrived to taunt me? That's certainly what it felt like, sitting there in that velvety shrine as the credits rolled past. Had I been conned? Deceived, duped, swindled? Or had I missed something? I decided, as did my group of fellow film goers - because we somehow intuited that David Lynch had wanted us to be so initially mystified - that we had best reexamine this daunting riddle. We sat through another showing that very same night & damn if we weren't just as flummoxed afterward. No one had a convincing theory to explain the relentless parade of captivating confusion that we'd just again witnessed. The solution, apparently, was going to require some diligence.Deciphering this film became a chronic challenge for my group of determined detectives. Over the next 3 or 4 weeks we spent countless hours analyzing, discussing, dissecting, & debating its meaning, but nothing felt conclusive. Eventually we watched the queer dark spectacle yet again & came away with a whole fresh crop of notions, but these all soon withered under the intense heat of our examinations. We would ruthlessly eviscerate one another's forced & impractical conjectures. We each began clinging defensively, helplessly, to our own feeble theory, mechanically repeating it to one another in a tragic display of denial. We were all stumped but refused to accept it. It started to get ugly, even vicious, as we'd denigrate one another in our fury to be relieved of this terrible burden. We had to desist or we'd all end up with our throats torn out.Fast forward five years to the low key, un-hyped, nearly unnoticed release of INLAND EMPIRE & the 3 core members of that old gang of Lynch fans. We were going to a Special Screening at a specially selected theater to which a friend of a friend had connections & we'd be among the very first in the entire tri-state area to attend Lynch's latest cinematic psychic assault. We were as giddy as school girls, but strangely, undeniably, we were all unusually polite with one another. We were treating each other rather gingerly, as though tip-toeing around some unseen sleeping monster. The heavy weight of our old Mulholland Drive encumbrance was upon us once again, but no one spoke of it. At least not then, not till after we had experienced that unbelievably, impossibly gargantuan Goliath of a mind f#@% that is INLAND EMPIRE.INLAND EMPIRE so utterly crushed us, so completely destroyed us. Our awareness, our consciousness, our wit, our entire being - thoroughly pulverized. It was astonishing just how nullified we were by what we had just witnesses, had just endured. Our minds were arid, desolate, vacant expanses of vacuous nothingness. What WAS that?!! A horrendous demonic courier from the deepest, vilest recesses of David's Gothic psyche had just delivered to us a most outrageously sinister parcel that was now demanding to be inspected. It felt as though I had been immersed in a vat of pure uncut dread. A cloying, claustrophobic curtain of doom had descended, obliterating all light of reason. That unrelenting barrage of horrific paranoia had overwhelmed me with an unbearably thick avalanche of hopelessness. This was going to be a very hard movie to 'get', is what we all three were thinking.I have veered off here onto the INLAND EMPIRE trail because it had inadvertently rekindled our debates of Mulholland Drive. We seemed to sense that perhaps there may possibly be a key to unlocking Mulholland somewhere in the dense, impenetrable quagmire of INLAND EMPIRE. But where, and in what form would it be, and how would we even recognize it? Gaining entrance to INLAND EMPIRE was just too intimidating, and so soon, by default, we focused again on Mulholland Drive. Someone suggested that there seemed to be something of a circular form to its structure, but was clueless as to a point of entry. That phrase 'Point of Entry' echoed in my gauzy mind, and then I recalled something that the agitated Polish men at the beginning of INLAND EMPIRE were discussing so emphatically: A way in. A way in to WHAT, I pondered? A way into the Rabbit Hole? What does that mean? I dunno. A way into America? Maybe. A way into the meaning of that damn movie?! Hmmm... AHA! OMFG! Lynch, you devious, sick bastard! I think I'm onto something here, I thought to myself. And indeed, I was because soon, and very effectively, I was scaling that formidable facade that had so discouraged me with its pretension to impenetrability. As I figured & felt my way into the INLAND EMPIRE labyrinth, I became aware of a very definite, precise mechanism at work in the action of its structure. The astounding realization of just exactly WHY INLAND EMPIRE was initially so impossible to fathom ignited within me a tremendous realization of just exactly what was also going on with Mulholland Drive. I began to test this theory, to see if the parts lined up, and it all very soon clicked perfectly into place. WOW! The whole film, rearranged & reconstructed in my mind, had gelled into a superbly coherent, fiendishly rational tale. Amazing! Absolutely gorgeous, the elegant beauty of its convoluted design. Mulholland Drive Solved!!! I didn't tell my two friends what I had discovered for at least one week, I was savoring that sweet rich feeling of superiority. It eventually occurred to me that they both might be doing the same...",9,3,5,22 September 2011
Caddyshack," As Far As Inane Juvenile Golf Comedies Go, It Wears The Green Jacket!
","Critics and reviewers and people in general too often forget what is the best standard by which to judge a comedy film. In fact, it's the only standard. Is it funny? That's it. There's the whole of it, the single attribute that I took into consideration in assessing this film's cinematic value. I didn't debate it's social relevance. I didn't consider it's plot coherence. I didn't compare and contrast the individual actor's performances to previous ones of the genre. As far as I know, there had never before been a profound critique of the insidious contemporary American class structure in the guise of an absurd sports parody. And there probably still isn't, this movie just couldn't care less about making an intelligent point. It's only purpose is to be funny, and at this humble, meager task it's a soaring triumph. It is a friggin' non stop laugh riot.There are so many iconic characters in this film that occupy such grand, imposing positions in the imaginations of appreciative fans; Ted Knight's outrageously pompous Judge Elihu Smails, Chevy Chase's irresistibly charismatic Ty Webb, Rodney Dangerfield's ridiculously gauche Al Czervik, and Bill Murray's sublimely revolting but adorable assistant grounds keeper Carl Spackler. Scarcely a day passes without me encountering someone, somewhere, either in person or on TV, attempting their version of Carl's quirky, crooked mouthed mumbled slurred speech. It's as ubiquitous and as irksome as an amateur reading of Shakespeare, but somehow more permissible. Bad Shakespeare is rarely just silly. The last two generations of comedy film fans have been the beneficiaries to an incalculable degree of Caddyshack's influence. Our culture is now infused with the blithe spirit of this preposterous film. It's certainly not the most profound cinematic experience of my life, but it is one of the most purely entertaining.If the broad, slapstick nonsense isn't your cup of tea, then maybe you revel in the torrent of old-timey one liners, or admire the quick, witty dialog, especially that delivered by an enviably confident Chevy. Perhaps the refreshingly frank and genuinely sensitive relationship between Michael O'Keefe's Danny Noonan and Sarah Holcomb's Maggie O'Hooligan holds some attraction for you. Or maybe, like me, you're just an enthusiastic devotee of dancing gophers. Whatever your taste, there's got to be at least something here to take you to that special place in your heart - that secret golf course of the soul - where Fun & Games are fine and respectable endeavors. And if it so happens that a nice bit of exclusive, upper class, excessively manicured real estate gets obliterated in the process, so much the better.",10,2,4,9 April 2011
Rudy," A Whiz Bang Rock 'em Sock 'em Stinkerooo
","I Believe! Yes, I do believe. I believe this is one heap of steaming, stinking poop. And it's barely an excuse that it's based on a 'true' story. It's ridiculous to get more than mildly impressed with the achievements of poor ugly duckling Rudy. I mean, it's hard for me to let myself go gaga for someone that is so obsessed with a senseless, brutal, IQ deficient game as football. I played some football in school and never thought much more of it than as a good workout and an opportunity to vent savagely. Any hope of being mentally challenged vanishes when it becomes clear that the 300 pound illiterate coming at you is hoping to introduce you to your maker. The only 'smart' move is to run. I was undersized, not quite as much as Rudy, but I at least had sense enough to recognize the dangers as pointless. Daniel E. 'Rudy' Ruettiger, in all fairness, just doesn't have the intellectual capacity for this awareness, so maybe he can be excused. But apparently neither do the film's creators express a broader awareness in this overly sentimental Rah Rah Cheer fest. Corny musical cues, rousing poetic pep talks, fast cut game day montages are all great devices, but artistic or even social value demand more than making you 'feel good.' You should be enlightened, broadened, and even — yeah I'm gonna say it — educated; or have you forgotten that this is a COLLEGE sports story. The better filmmakers 'educate' very subtly, indirectly. 'North Dallas Forty' did exactly that, all the while respecting the efforts and sacrifices made by our modern day gladiators. And to a certain degree so did The Longest Yard, where at least the bone crushing, spine snapping, brain melting criminally savage violence is occurring where it's slightly more appropriate — behind prison bars. And the fact that college sports, even back in 1975, especially football, are such commercially dominated, ultimately corrupt enterprises, is never addressed. It all adds up to just a short sighted, simple minded celebration of a clichéd and hollow conception of a now somewhat disreputable athletic activity. Rudy is shamelessly manipulative; it's cynically pandering to a deluded public — that's you.People who compare this film to Rocky forget that for many of us fans of that 70s classic, that film's greatest winning quality was it's comical manner, it's absurd self indulgence. I don't cheer for Rocky because he's the 'under dog,' I cheer because the film actually acknowledges just how ridiculous the whole overblown, fantastical myth really is. I am often laughing AT it, just as it's talented director, John G. Avildsen, intended. The Rocky series immediately thereafter plummeted into a steep decline, thanks entirely to Mr. Stallone's demented control. Though Avildsen received directing credit for Rocky V, it was in name only, as he later complained publicly how Sylvester had commandeered the entire production and overrode all directorial decisions. The fabulous product speaks for itself. My point being that I'm rarely impressed with strait forward sports yarns, especially when they strive for allegorical significance. And even worse, when they're so earnestly contrive to be inspiring. Rudy is not a total failure because it's a fairly decent story, and it has some clever writing and great acting, particularly from Sean Astin. But the film avoids the bigger, obvious issue of Football's dubious social value, and never bothers to question the way we all let ourselves be lessened by it. OK, yeah, maybe we really are just primitive, aggressive animals, but indulging and celebrating the destructive, inhuman aspect of our natures is just as worthless as denying it. And that, to me, is the better story.",5,10,29,8 September 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The Most Vivid Exploitation of Cinema in the Sevice of Great Storytelling
","What's the best part of this astonishingly mesmerizing film? I'd say it's the thorough mastery of the cinematic form. It's every element is blended into a towering achievement of modern movie making, whose seamless integration of story, technique, effects, and performances is truly genius. Charlie Kaufman was already one of my all time favorite screen writers, his Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Human Nature had already so completely entertained me. But Michael Gondry's direction of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (ESOTSM) has set a new lofty standard for all future celluloid captured creativity.Depicting that elusive, mercury slick quality of our thoughts, dreams and memories has long been a major challenge for all film makers. Many have relied somewhat successfully on a deft control of pace, where subtle shifts in timing and rhythm are all that's needed to prompt us to an altered reality. Gondry does this as perfectly as anyone else. Others have been much more blatant and broad, employing such conventions as blurred, hazy images recorded through Vaseline smeared lenses, or even depositing their characters into suddenly severely disproportionate sets, absurdly large or tiny props introduced as a short hand gimmick. Gondry avails himself of these conventional techniques, but only to masterfully exploit them for their comedic impact. And too many other less capable hacks have not even bothered to differentiate the two states, merely having the dreamer wake suddenly, violently, to reveal that the previous experience was all just mental chimera. A cheap, lousy stunt. Yes, Gondry even stoops to this cornball level, and does it so very fluidly, seemingly as a gesture of genuine respect to all the cinematic tactics that have so powerfully informed and shaped our own self illusions and delusions. But Michael Gondry has also fully grasped the value of computer aided graphics in merging both the exterior and interior worlds. The dreamed, imagined, remembered locales and environs are all as 'real' as any anything else in this film till they suddenly begin to fray, crack and crumble. Rooms and houses are seen to disassemble themselves methodically, randomly, or explosively with utterly natural grace. Like a drunken, drugged fantasy, the whole of the universe unzips and inverts; gravity now repulses and cause precedes effect. It's so deeply disorienting. These meticulously rendered, dizzying episodes are precisely the experience that's needed to convey the frantic, paranoid terror of losing one's memories. It feels as though all computer graphic effects were developed exclusively, expressly for this one exact movie.The script is brilliantly self deprecating, as if continually surprised to find itself actually passing for science fiction. It's an admirable conceit that Charlie has everyone so ambivalent about the fantastical mind erasing procedure till well after things are under way. There's nothing more dizzying than to have everyone not realize just how dizzy you are. It's these subtle, unique expressions of wondrous doubt and confusion that really demand so much of the cast. Jim Carey's subdued, focused performance is often exhilarating, and always exactly on key. His moments as a tiny, not-so tiny, tot version of himself are sublimely hilarious. Kate Winslet, as clever as she is gorgeous, hits so many amazing notes with absolutely pitch perfect skill. And the support crew are all entirely wonderful, with Tom Wilkinson effortlessly animating the beleaguered but arrogant doctor, and Mark Ruffalo so comfortable as a slacker nerd with hip habits. Kirsten Dunst is adorable as his playmate coworker, and Elijah Wood makes post-teen angst feel as sharp and dirty as a rusty nail.This delicate balance of hilarity and poignancy sounds like a fine recipe for old time movie romance, and ESOTSM would have been only that if everything wasn't so expertly orchestrated towards a more sophisticated purpose. Yes, it's true we are cheering for the reunion of our tragically separated hero and heroine, that's the obvious bit. But what elevates and distinguishes this tale is it's insistence on making valid claims to virtue and nobility, much more so than any simple love story ever could. Kaufman and Gondry certainly recognize the value and power that shared affection plays in our daily existence, but they have tied this emotion to an even larger, deeper experience. They have hitched it to our sense of consciousness. What truly interests Charlie is our ability - our necessity - to consider and reflect on just who we are, on who we want to be, and on how we strive be that person. He is hoping to introduce us again to our own sense of destiny. He is a master technician at constructing elaborate devices to capture our imaginations and direct them towards more obscure, rare regions of the psyche. This treacherously seductive machine, this supremely elegant film has carried me to a genuinely higher place. I actually feel enlightened and enlarged and more human for having seen it.",9,1,2,28 February 2011
Titanic," A Gargantuan Disappointment
","Titanic sinks itself on technical, artistic and ethical reasons. Firstly, the script is horribly corny and tedious. Everyone speaks as though they're one day out of acting school, over-emoting even the simplest, most minor of thoughts. I never felt anything genuinely warm or tender between the two stars. For a 3+ hour movie, there's ridiculously little time spent on character development. And the shallow clichéd narration of the old lady gets extremely tedious.Secondly, the effects do not hold up today, in 2011. You might say that's an unfair criticism, to hold a 14 year old movie up to modern technical standards. The effects, it turns out, are the only part I originally liked back in 1997. At that time I would have given the movie a 6 or 7 just for the visual spectacle. It now looks dated and awkward, and it's just not enough to justify any effort to watch it today. Finally, and most importantly, the story just falls down by not playing up the doubts and fears that many people had at the time of the ship's construction. There were experts in maritime engineering that forewarned of such a possible catastrophe, but neither the owners nor the public were concerned. The notion of being able to safely maneuver such a Leviathan was loudly challenged by nautical men, but the Great Ship is presented as an unquestionably positive, glorious achievement. The film conveys that it was entirely the fault of chance—an act of nature, a freak accident, a stray iceberg—that downed the ship, and not ignorance, pride, hubris. As it is I was waiting eagerly for it's inevitable demise, I almost felt everyone deserved it. James Cameron should have gone down with his tremendous, beautiful beast.And it certainly is beautiful. We are treated to near pornographic views of gleaming stacks, sumptuous accommodations, and throbbing mechanical drives. The best of society are so eager to participate in this obscene orgy of excess, but Mr. Cameron wants me to feel sympathetic with these self important gluttons. OK, so Leonardo and Kate are 'different', but still they are deluded. Their only crime, perhaps, is their youth, so yes, their story is a tragedy. Their standing on the bow of the mighty ship is an iconic image that's truly impressive, but there's no underlying sense of conscience to give it high contrast. It comes off as just a shallow, slick promotional ad for the cruise line. My point is that I feel it's so sad to see how seemingly convinced people were that technological marvels were proof of man's superiority and divine place on Earth. We now know that such absurdly over-sized endeavors truly only serve a very few at the great expense of very many. And it's happening today right now at an at even more frantic pace. We are doomed if we stay the course, but 'Titanic' celebrates the choice to not reconsider our way. By intentionally creating such a tremendous sensation in our culture this movie, Mr. Cameron, and every one involved in some way took on a responsibility to reward our attention with something worthwhile and substantial. It does not. It purposely avoids any such responsibility or awareness. It is pure escapist fantasy of the highest order that defies it's viewers to question any of it's splendor. I find this insulting to be expected not to think for myself. That's just so depressing, and so tragic in ways which James Cameron is apparently oblivious. I feel that this film is just too much fluff and glitter, not worthy of it's efforts and costs. We are supposed to be smarter today about not living for such trivial wasteful excess. It's exactly this kind of consumption that is accelerating our ecological decline and inflicting extreme hardships on so many millions of disadvantaged people the world over. That's a very big heavy thought, for sure, but this massive movie is just asking for — demanding — this kind of consideration. Titanic omits the most important compelling bit of the story. The old lady's love may live on, but her planet is sinking...",6,1,4,29 May 2009
The Departed," Violence on a Pedestal
","Gruesome. Its almost disgustingly violent, nearly revolting. Some call it gritty and real, others says it's blood soaked and sensationalistic. I think it's classic Scorcese - brutal yet elegant, visceral yet poignant. It's a grizzly ballet, a macho cinematic dance. The details of the story are well recorded in other commentaries so I'll limit my statement to my other impressions. DiCaprio is a very fine actor, with a remarkable face. His boyish looks are a high bar for him to maneuver in creating a believable tough guy, and he clears this hurdle easily, powerfully. Matt Damon is a natural as a Boston street smart cop. Mark Wahlberg likewise is a perfect fit as a hard nosed detective. Alec Baldwin is a sheer pleasure to watch, just about stealing all his scenes. And Papa Jack is in great form as an aging, haggard bad ass, past his prime but proudly protecting his turf, the King of the Streets. It gets very gory and grim, a lot of guns and blood, not much left to the imagination. Martin Scorcese uses violence like other directors use dance numbers or musical interludes, as accents and punctuations to expertly developed character studies. It's interesting that their viciousness somehow doesn't define them, but rather, these characters are merely colored and completed by their individual brands of brutality. Scorcese, it seems, has little doubt as to Man's innate inclination for violence, but he is just as shocked and awed by it as we are. He has explored this theme many times, inspiring a legion of imitators and fanatics, and once again breaks new ground with a mesmerizing, if not numbing, barrage of testosterone fueled mayhem and bravado. The love story is weak, like most of Scorcese's female roles usually are. That, I think, is what robs him of the Oscar nearly every time. Yeah, I give it eight bullets out of a full magazine of ten.",8,0,0,14 October 2006
There Will Be Blood," Why So Many People Hate This Excellent Movie...
","Why Daniel Plainview becomes such an evil character - that his personal motives are not clearly stated - is too much of a question for many people. The 'answer', if in fact there's any real mystery, can be found in the film's superb cinematic method. This method is the curious angles, the vast vistas, the jump cut edits, and the subtle rhythms that form an eloquent but mute narration that tells a much more vivid story than any dialog or exposition ever could. It's in the near silences of pure movie action that we are able to glimpse the the dark forces that drive Daniel Plainview. People unaccustomed to or ignorant of the pleasures to be found in the act of reflection and contemplation will likely find these moments of the film to be very boring and too self indulgent. That's a tragedy, for them, because it's a great thrill to be included in the creative process, to be counted on to complete the story in our own minds where the creations of our own imaginations are so tremendously satisfying. Apparently, so many people are just too intellectually limited, to damn impatient, to appreciate this film's subtle power.Daniel Day Lewis has created a genuinely sinister persona, a compellingly complex villain, from just a few scraps of curious behavior. When we first meet him as an ambitious young man he already is something of an oddity. Daniel's character, his temperament, is powerfully restrained, disciplined, but volatile, explosive. Though his outbursts are few, they are impressive, and the threat of their recurrence at any moment darkens all his encounters. But his fiery disposition serves him well in forging his own path, in carving out a life for himself in an unforgiving, harsh environment. And it's precisely this fierce individualistic streak that both fuels his professional progress and sabotages his personal relations.His great ambitions - an obvious parallel of those of our republic's early years - seem reasonable and worthwhile. And, as Daniel is fond of professing to the naive, vulnerable locals whom he so willfully defrauds, all our achievements are worthless if not done for the benefit of the family. His family, a chanced upon orphan boy, serves him well as an effective prop in his nefarious deceptions. But he does love the boy, and he does otherwise treat him quite well. It's complicated.And it gets very complicated when he chooses to send the boy away to school following a tragic accident. It seems a reasonable enough decision at first, difficult as it is for us to witness. Daniel is blind to the error of this choice till it is made clear to him in a miraculously complex moment of self realization. This moment of clarity occurs while he is performing a very public ruse before the local congregation, pretending to be born again as a ploy to gain possession of a local man's land. As he begins his renouncement we sense that there's a sly devil at play within him. Daniel barely conceals his raging contempt for the young minister who is sincerely relishing this very public humiliation of his bitter rival. But soon Daniel's defiance seems to relax, his hidden rage transforms. He is, it seems, experiencing a genuine revelation, as he roars louder and louder the words the minister feeds him: 'I have abandoned my child. I have abandoned my boy!' 'Yes, you have abandoned your boy' I was almost saying out loud, as the truth of his action is suddenly revealed. And he has this charlatan minister to thank for his redemption. Daniel realizes this and he smiles as the howling minister violently slaps him in the face harder and harder, again and again. Soon, the passion of the moment recedes, and Daniel is accepted into the community, and sits exhausted in the pew with a warm embrace from the young girl who happens to be the daughter of the rancher he first conned and is the sister of the disingenuous minister. Daniel has simultaneously gained a profound insight into his own character and has amazingly dodged the corrupt minister's envious wrath. Has he beaten God, the Devil, both, or maybe neither. Then, without any obvious cues or overt indications, I was then somehow increasingly aware that Daniel's psychic triumph will now only lead to a harsh retaliation against the minister. Just what form that retribution will take or when it will occur is unclear. This all is transmitted so very subtly, so very artfully, without any dialog, just through Daniel's remarkable performance. This subtlety is the reason so many viewers are so underwhelmed by and contemptuous of this mature, intelligent film. There is then a profound sense of impending doom infusing the remainder of the film. It's just a matter of time now till destiny is fulfilled, till providence wins out. And when it suddenly, unexpectedly does, it's doubly shocking. How and why Daniel does what he does is so grimly, so exquisitely satisfying, that I was shocked with myself, with my primal reaction.This self revelation, that I can be shocked by my own impulses and desires, is a deeply disturbing aspect of the human psyche that PT Anderson has chosen to illuminate. It's the point, it seems, of the movie. And then I was stunned to realize that what I had just witnessed may well have been merely the hysterical delusion of a crazed, relentless, senile mind. Did what just occur 'really' happen, or was it a brutal dream, a waking nightmare? This remarkable, challenging question of whether or not we can trust our own eyes, apparently, is lost on just about everyone who has seen this film. And that's a very big, very critical loss. But I think I shouldn't be surprised...",9,3,4,29 January 2011
Inception," A Bloated Feast for the Eyes and an Hors D'uvre for the Mind
","It takes its own sweet time setting up the intricate (absurd) plot and detailing much of the back story, spending an awful lot of time explaining itself as people go on and on reciting the rules and logic and pitfalls of dream invasion. I often found myself murmuring 'Yes, yes, I get it.' So many words - so many ideas - unnecessarily spoken. But this slightly overlong odyssey is charged with scenes of superior creativity. Sprawling between the static, verbose moments are genuinely spectacular episodes of stunning hyper-surreal imagination. The grand visual effects are so fluid and organic. The real world is entirely subsumed in this fantastical universe of spellbinding vistas and jaw dropping action, all marvelously animated by some deeply disorienting physics. I was often impatient with the movie, cursing the intermittent scenes of tedious exposition, but what stays with me, however, hauntingly, is a genuine sense of awe. I feel like I've been through a harrowing experience, much more challenging and treacherous than the all the media hype had prepared me for. I had watched its TV commercials convinced that it would be relying entirely on computer generated effects for all its allure. But it turns out the clever concepts that drive the action are captivating as well. I've spent quite a few idle moments reflecting on the perplexing notion of multiple layered dreams, pondering the interplay of the relative time-space of each layer. The old tired cliché of a dream within a dream is here entirely deconstructed and exploded into a bewildering symphony of synchronized chaos. Chaos is an ingredient, for sure, and for so many viewers, the defining one. They have found the story to be too randomly illogical and ponderously convoluted. What's so funny about this reaction is that it's possible ONLY if you expected this farcical tale to to be anything else but purely ridiculous. For me the only way to receive the crass, dreary product that Hollywood regularly excretes on us is to accept it ironically, sarcastically. It's just as much fun to not only laugh along with the somewhat humorous shenanigans, but to also laugh AT the contrived crap - a full throated, hearty roar of mocking contempt. I take my yucks wherever I can get 'em. So, armed with this snide attitude, a movie just isn't able to 'let me down.' I always find something to enjoy, even if it means taking pleasure in despising it. Got that? Good. I didn't expect Inception to change my world, or even worse, to support my pitifully puny version of life's meaning. That seems to be most people's expectation of movies, to have their own major and minor delusions validated. Go figure...Leonardo is riveting, as always, and does his utmost best with the often cumbersome script. As tortuously explicit as the dialog gets, Leo manages to sustain a convincing and compelling character. Ellen Page strikes a nice balance of innocent wonder and precocious arrogance. She reminds me a lot of Jeneane Garofalo, but cuter and not as smug. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has the look and composure of a classic Hollywood star, but the talent of a veteran character actor; a real pleasure to watch him work. And there are a few heavyweights filling out the cast including a barely recognizable, substantial Tom Berenger, and also the usually sublime Ken Watanabe, who is partially wasted here in a minimal role. Michael Caine's elegant appearances bookend the film, anchoring the whole fanciful, capricious event. His regal presence lends gravitas to any production.As obtuse and self satisfied as Inception is I have found that there are few films that have taken such complete advantage of the film medium. I can only think of three or four other movies that have stunned me more. One of them, of course, is Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A space Odyssey from 1968, and another is David Lynch's Inland Empire from 2006, which has taken the art of cinema to an unprecedented level, employing absolutely no computer generated effects but achieving what is, for me, one of the most intense, profound, mind and soul shattering cinematic experience of my life. It's indescribably remarkable. The Matrix, in case you're wondering, is not one of the others. HA! That steaming heap of ox dung is remarkable only for its mind numbing stupidity. But Inception, in spite of its verbal excesses, is extreme good fun. 7.5/10",9,2,14,15 April 2011
Toy Story 3," The First Film I've Seen In A Theater in Over Nine Years ! ! !
","My hands, no, my whole body is trembling with delight as I try to tap out my simple, jumbled excitement. TS3 has so thoroughly entertained me, it's seems kinda wrong to call it a sequel. While the majority of the fabulous characters are familiar returnees from the previous installments, it stands completely on its own as a triumph of artful, inspired story telling. I haven't sat in a theater in nearly a decade - the hassle, the cost, and the hype all turned me off from movie going. But remembering how magical and deeply moving were TS1 & TS2, I didn't hesitate when I was invited along with some friends.If live action films could manage to express even half of the wonder and joy that this trilogy possesses, I might consider returning to the multiplex, but it's just not too likely. Today I'm more a fan of mature, serious films, that provoke thought and doubt and self reflection, but this remarkable franchise somehow manages to recharge my draining supply of patience with my fellow world citizens. At my age, 48, it's absurd to find such consolation and inspiration in an animated children's movie, but I'll take it wherever I can get it. (Wall-E, which I watched on cable, comes damn close with it's bittersweet comment on our seriously misdirected society.) John Lassiter and company have again succeeded at a level that even Steven Spielberg must envy. Bravo! WOW! Encore!",8,4,7,28 June 2010
Moonrise Kingdom," Youth is Not Wasted on the Young. It's Abused by Adults
","The two lead kids are a curious, quirky revamping of Shakespeare's star-crossed adolescent lovers from Verona, but the inexorable obstacle thwarting Sam and Suzy's eternal union is not their feuding clans but the increasingly bizarre, malfunctioning society into which they've been born. The 60s in America were a time of drastic, profound social changes and 1965 was a year immediately on the threshold of some of the most drastic, most disorienting upheavals to the status quo. A generation of educated, financially advantaged, and chemically motivated young people were beginning to reject the many negative, outdated beliefs that afflicted the unsteady, faltering nation, and they did this by adopting radical new attitudes, fashions, and philosophies. They molded these into their personal arsenals of weapons of defiance, and would deploy them against the powers that be. Parents often were the most convenient and most deserving targets of the generational revolution, and this certainly is the case for the two precocious 'tweens here. Suzy's parents' disintegrating marriage is a potent catalyst in moving her to take moderately drastic action and escape to the far side of the mythically quaint New England island, New Penzance, along with the stoic, strange, but charming Sam, whose parents are guilty of the even more heinous and inexcusable injustice of having died and left him an unwanted orphan. Throughout the film there are plenty of subtle - very subtle - hints at the many classic stories from recent and distant history that deal with childhood traumas, triumphs, and treacheries, such as Lord of the Flies, Oliver Twist, The Tempest, Hamlet, The Hardy Boys, Old Yeller, Barn Burning, and many others. None of these sources is bluntly, crassly, overtly referenced or quoted. Rather, these many appropriate influences are only faintly detectable through the unquestionably clear, but curiously distorting prism of Wes Anderson's now exceptionally well developed cinematic method. Interestingly, all the well known literary antecedents from which Wes draws upon have been inverted - flipped on their heads - so that it's only by a very definite spinning around and turning inside out of the increasingly outlandish situations that we might guess and appreciate from whence it all comes. That's a hard feat to pull off even just once or twice in a movie, but Moonrise Kingdom is a jam packed solid 94 minute parade of exactly this trick. For example, in The Tempest Miranda is alone and isolated on a nearly deserted isle with her father and - like any creature inexperienced in the crass ways of the wider world - she naively assumes that all new visitors to her island posses hearts of gold. But Suzy, in the incessant company of only her younger three brothers, is shockingly sexually aware and sophisticated, or at least appears to be if you chose to judge her by her mod mini skirts and her lavish eye makeup and her brutally honest and sharp tongue. Another example of how the film cleverly compliments it's literary sources is the tightly militaristic coordination of Wes' khaki clad kids, which plays so nicely against our memories of the increasing ragged and savage shipwrecked gang in Lord of the Flies. The subtle contrast is made doubly resonant when, unlike the inhuman treatment dealt out to the incompetent misfit Piggy, Wes' clean cut, spotlessly uniformed scout troop - in spite of their well meaning but bumbling chain smoking troop leader played exquisitely by Ed Norton - independently conspires to heroically rescue the self ostracized Sam from the clutches of the nefarious adults in a brilliantly choreographed Seal Team 6 style maneuver. The deft allusions to literary teen dramas are here only to help us grasp just how upside down their world around them has gotten, and by implication, our world around us today. And then there's the spectacularly understated beach camp scenario with Sam and Suzy that develops into a preposterous spoof of that most ridiculous of all teen love fantasies, The Blue Lagoon. I bet almost nobody who has seen this film gets the joke, but I did and it's a touch of genius in an already superbly intelligent and genuinely funny film.Wes has made it look deceptively simple and natural, and therefor many viewers will likely miss the full brilliance of his masterful achievement. That's not to say that those possibly oblivious viewers won't enjoy his surprisingly nuanced and deeply satisfying fable; they just won't admire and cherish it and be raving about it as emphatically as I am. It's so confidently, and efficiently, and stylishly executed that all the sly nods to its cultural heritage finally are icing on a sincerely delicious and satiating cake. I kept catching myself thinking 'I need to see this scene again,' and 'I really wanna see that scene again!' Well, I just gotta have me another big fat slice of the whole damn movie.",10,2,4,4 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Has a good story and cool effects, but it's soooooooooooo violent.
","I found the various characters to be quite entertaining and the mythological allusions to be very fitting. War is always entertaining and war in space, with the grand glorious backdrop of infinite stars can only be spectacular. It was so profound an experience for my adolescent mind in 1977 that I wanted it to be real. I wanted to live in this majestic universe of black and white choices and absolute power. I am still recovering from the profound impression it had on me, 33 years ago. Arrested development is an understatement.Many millions of words have been written about this film series but few of them deal with the morality of war; the fact that killing - no matter how inventive the device with which you execute someone - is probably a mistake. It seems that violent death is a deeply cherished aspect of our culture, a defining element in fact. Even the treacly adorable Ewoks have their heads and arms and torsos mangled as payment for their appearance in the series. Seems like a raw deal to me... Anyway, if destroying living beings is something to be celebrated, then Star Wars is a Fabulous Fête. Magnificent Mayhem. Enjoy.",10,0,0,1 December 2010
The Thin Red Line," It's Just So Easy to Misunderstand This Film...
","Because of Terrence Malick's sparse, efficient technique - choosing to allow the marvelous images, the nuanced shifts in tone, and the character's own impressions to provide whatever philosophy the film may have - The Thin Red Line is very easily misunderstood. There's very few, if any, moments that one can point to and clearly discern a simple, common, facile attitude. Every scene is an exercise in ambivalence and contradiction. For many people, this sort of complex reasoning is just too troublesome. They grow weary of the process of unwrapping for themselves the curious mysteries of the soul that this film explores. They are the frustrated, angry, bitter ones. I, however, am one of the amazed and thankful ones. It's the most gripping war movie I've ever seen. It's entirely an expression of the various soldier's psyches. Their personal motives, ambitions and fears assume the foreground, eclipsing the more sensational aspects of war. Troop tactics, martial strategies and national politics are barely recognized. An internal monologue, a half remembered poem, an incoherent rant constitute the bulk of the film's dialog, centering the action within the over strained, cracking minds of the combatants.Language is the weapon of choice as each soldier battles to retain a thread of dignity, a glimmer of hope. There's no right or wrong, just the possible and the impossible. The impossible is again and again forced upon them, demanding the most elemental, primal responses. Every confrontation is a wasting of precious sanity. Watching someone be eviscerated is only half as terrible as experiencing another man's psychic disintegration. The trauma of baring witness to this slow motion slaughter of the soul surpasses even the most graphic moments of carnage.The cast is huge but the star is Nick Nolte who very probably crossed his own thin line into the realm of madness. He so entirely merged his own psychosis into his character's, it's terrifically disturbing. He is riveting as he erupts in volcanic bursts of terror, hubris, conceit and bravado. It's as though we're present at a clinical exam of a tormented soul. All the other actors are very fine, notably Jim Caveziel as the central conscience. His posture - a wide eyed peace guru of indeterminate commitment to the 'cause' - ruffles the feathers of career soldier Sean Penn. Penn is compelling, if a little stiff. In fact, Nolte's molten performance has everyone else looking relatively stiff. But with Sean's pedigree, I kept waiting for him to rise to Nick's challenge. Nick does have 20 years of experience on Sean, so maybe that's an unfair expectation. A totally fair criticism, however, is just how ridiculous is John Travolta. He can barely coordinate his own tongue to form intelligible words. His vocal drone is like the ringing of a lead bell. He's an absurdly inarticulate, flat cardboard cutout. Luckily he makes only a brief appearance.The theme of 'Man vs. Man as opposed to Man vs. Nature' is gorgeously revealed in the beatific visions of the tropical jungle. What acts as an alternative Garden of Eden provides a lush backdrop to Malick's sublime morality. 'If life weren't so tragic, it could be so beautiful'; a notion emerging from all the lingering gazes upon transcendent vistas, tender child's play, and home bound flash backs. A respite from war's horrors is offered in tender, dreamlike images of domesticity. Ironically, one of the most shocking, most traumatic wounds is inflicted by a Dear John letter received late in the film by a love sick soldier. Had he been made to endure this outrageous hell fire only to be made to suffer an even more exquisitely cruel hell? It's truly a godless moment, witnessing a breaking heart. Wyler's 'The Best Years of Our Lives'(1946), Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory'(1957) and 'Full Metal Jacket'(1987), Nichols' 'Catch-22'(1970), Hill's 'Slaughterhouse-Five'(1972), Cimino's 'The Deer Hunter'(1978), Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now'(1979), Joffé's 'The Killing Fields'(1984), Stone's 'Platoon'(1986), and DiPalma's 'Casualties of War'(1989) had cleared considerable psychic space, laying a broad foundation for skepticism of traditional concepts of war, even our own wars. Because those films had accustomed us to the themes of profound ambivalence, cynical patriotism, and delusional, if not corrupt leadership, Terrence Malick was granted extra time and space to develop a particularly vague, ethereal philosophy. And so, 'The Thin Red Line' was privileged to luxuriate in prolonged self reflection. It is continually considering its own role as a very public forum for inquiry, constantly doubting its own ability - or right - to ask the simple questions that it does. The specifics of its realizations are inseparable from its haunting imagery, from its hypnotic cinematic method. The true story can only be intuited through the patient act of experiencing its intricately woven rhythms. As a meditation or a prayer or a lamentation on what is war, this film is unequaled. An extremely crude summation could be 'A war hero, it seems, is anyone who survives as even a ghost of their former self,' but this, at best, is only misleading.The occasionally overwrought narration and Travolta's tedious bit may have slightly detracted (very slightly), but the 'Thin Red Line' is very highly recommended for it's uniquely poignant insights into the horrendous psychosis that is war. If you're not deeply affected by this powerfully evocative film, I'd be very concerned.",9,1,3,13 April 2010
Contact," Contact 'Touches' Greatness
","This potentially remarkable film falls just short of the cosmic realm to which it aspires, but it does frequently soar to dizzying heights. Unfotunately, it's occasionally pulled back down to less rarefied atmospheres under the weight of its overwrought, clunky romantic malfunctions. Jody Foster's character's atheism may be used against her to deny her the opportunity to fulfill a lifetime dream, and her attraction to the man responsible for this possible denial is played for all it's melodramatic, soap opera worth. And Jodie Foster - a consummate pro whose career credits are the envy of any working actor - is here just so relentlessly earnest and strident, and as focused as a cobra poised to strike. It's a bit of a one note performance, and maybe a little tiring. She does, of course, posses a wonderfully photogenic face which we are invited to scrutinize at great length in the countless increasingly tight close ups of her tense square jaw and piecing baby blue eyes. The special effects are a bit sketchy by today's astronomically high standards, but 15 years ago I imagine audience's were sufficiently impressed. The most glaring weakness are the matte painting backgrounds upon which has been place a considerable responsibility to generate awe and wonder, but their unnatural cartooniness is distracting. Most of the other digital effects are executed sufficiently well enough to serve the increasingly exciting action. The effects, and in fact the entire film very effectively plays off our collective memory of other classic landmark Sci-Fi films, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind, and even The Andromeda Strain with its terse and clinical scientific dialog executed with icy cold precision. These three films are certainly very fine company to be keeping and Contact earns its position by virtue of the challenging and unique questions raised by its intelligent script. It might come off as self important and smug of me to be nit picking this film, but my petty criticisms can be read as a testament to the high standard to which Contact strives and largely achieves.",8,0,2,17 November 2012
