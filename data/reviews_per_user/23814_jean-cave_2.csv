Come and See," memorable decades later
","Like some of the other commentators I watched this movie with subtitles on channel 4 at 3am one weekday in 1993/4? with my then teenage son. The TV guide rated it as one star. (Always a chance then it might be really good.) Dave was studying for his ALevel Media Studies but we didn't really need an excuse. Our family are all voracious consumers. So we stayed up late and We watched.... This is a long movie and by the end we both sodden with tears, every part our body's anguished by the sheer visceral immediacy of the horror. This is a truly remarkable film experience. The news of the Beslan School massacre recently reminded me of how we had felt and I had to ring Dave to get the title but he remembered it too. He said it was the most 'impactful?' film hes seen I am so glad other film buffs on this site feel that too, as no one I know personally, saw it that night.",Null,3,5,24 September 2004
Hero," I am not partial to martial
","This is martial arts wallpaper from Argos, filmed in shampoo advert cinematography. It has a puppeteers plot and Topshop costume. Football club style fight scenes and B list soap opera stars. I am afraid to say this is utter pap. Luckily it was orange Wednesday so my ticket was free. There was no texture or believabilty about it. The tone was just somehow wrong too and well just unconvincing. Two of my companions fell asleep as well. Are we really sharing culture with films like this?. Give me Spring summer autumn winter spring. Now there's a beautiful movie that personifies something moving subtle and tangible about big themes.",1,2,8,13 October 2004
