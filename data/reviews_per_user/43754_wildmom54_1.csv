The New World," oy!
","What pretentious drivel. A two and a half hour movie that felt NEVER ENDING!!! Absolutely painful. People were walking out or shifting constantly in their seats. The man behind me was literally cursing under his breath! I have to give Malick some credit for some really lovely shots...but that is just not enough to sustain this film. There is virtually no dialogue and what there is, is absolutely indecipherable. The score is uninspiring and repetitive and drowns out the few words in the so called script. If you don't already know the story, you won't have a clue!!! So slow paced, you are ready to do yourself in after the first 30 minutes!!! Save your money and rent Disney's Pochahantas. At least you'll be able to sing along!!!",1,18,58,12 December 2005
