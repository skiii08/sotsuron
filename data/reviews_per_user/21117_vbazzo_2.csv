The Blair Witch Project," Learn to Like This Movie
","This is real terror. There is nothing worse than the sensation of loneliness and confusion in our minds. If you concentrate, and believe you are one of the kids, you'll be scared to death. If you expect an idiot, but brave main character, who screams a lot, but is able to kick the stupid murderer, go watch SCREAM, or I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. They have plots like: 'You ran over me! Die!'. The Blair Witch Project is so much different than that! It takes three typical youngs, used to good life, and with the normal teenager sensation of omnipotence, to the woods. At the beginning, everything seems so funny and happy, but as the time goes by, they realise they are not as powerful or smart as they thought, and that their hope is giving place to insanity.People complain about Heather's screaming. What is she supposed to do? Scream once and be quiet while something is after her? I surely wouldn't be calm. Other people say 'piles of rocks are not scary'. NO? How about finding these piles after all you've passed the last night, living in a city where the Blair Witch Tale frightens the citizens for ages? I would feel scared to death. People who say this film are as dumb as the kids IN the movie. They think that they could handle the situation easily, and that what they've passed is nothing... Well, I doubt you can go camping after seeing this movie with attention... Remember: This movie is for people with imagination, with good taste and with sensibility for other people's feelings. This way, you're gonna love this movie and feel frightened for a long time...",10,2,4,7 October 1999
Fight Club," Amazingly Smart, Highly Disturbing
","What is 'The Fight Club'? Maybe the strongest and most daring movie of the year. David Fincher is brilliant. He has this amazing capacity to make movies electrical, powerful and disturbing. The smallest details of this movie are so well-done that the final result was perfect. The movie is about a man. A man lost in a pathetic life where collecting furniture was his major excitement. A man who couldn't sleep. A man looking for salvation. After meeting Tyler Durden, his life changes in many ways. He discovers his violent side, his willing to be free. Both create the ultimate therapy for people who can't find a meaning to their lives: The Fight Club.There men beat each other only to feel alive. Is this impossible? How many people enjoy boxing anyway? After the club becomes famous, though, Tyler starts to create something that will go out of control soon, and that will change that man's life forever. Fantastic dialogues. Amazing character development. A much better twist then 6th sense's. A flawless complex script. Very funny moments. Very tense moments. Nonsense. Insanity. Mischief. Mayhem. Soap.This movie really can rock your world. It made me feel much different about life itself, and is one of the best movies EVER. Highly recommended to anyone who likes to think. Edward Norton is amazing. Brad Pitt does his job well and David Fincher shows us once again that he has a great potential and must keep us addicted to his movies. A high praise to the guy who wrote the book as well. There is a guy who knows lots about humanity. 10/10",10,0,1,30 July 2000
