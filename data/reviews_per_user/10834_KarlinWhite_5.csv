Hereditary," GREATEST HORROR MOVIE EVER!
",GREATEST HORROR MOVIE EVER!!!!! Whoa~!! Thank you!,10,1,6,11 October 2019
The Lion King," I guess it's on me.
","No it's not actually. Yes, I did hoped a lot from this but the movie itself was light when it came to emotions and the musics were all tuned down so the hired voice actors could sing them. Speaking of, voice actors are so cliche and some of them didn't even match the characters except the monkey.
If you haven't watched the animation version of this movie then it would be okay to watch this? But then I would highly recommend, in fact anyone would recommend, that you watch the animation version rather than this one.",1,1,2,11 October 2019
Midsommar," I was expecting too much.
","Story was certainly interesting but a quietly driven horror story without any shocking progress wasn't really my type of movies. There are some of those scenes yes, but most of them are shocking aftermath.
I guess the point of interests here in this film is how the characters react, behave, and change from those aftermaths. Totally not my thing. I need more.",5,1,3,11 October 2019
Up," The most beautiful animation ever.
",This is the most beautiful animation I've ever watched.,10,1,2,11 March 2019
Marriage Story," I would've liked it better if...
","Personally, I would've like it better if story developed to a direction where the couple gets to rekindle their love. Naive and unrealistic, I know, but this is a fiction after all. I expect certain level of drama from there.",7,1,1,30 June 2020
