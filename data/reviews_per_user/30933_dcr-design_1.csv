Howl's Moving Castle," A mousy, young millineress in looking for a way to undo a spell cast upon her finds her heart in a world of magic
","I didn't see the subtitled version that the reviewer did but the dubbed version was completely cohesive and made sense both to me and my 10 year old nephew. The dubbing was excellent and the US casting blended beautifully with the gorgeous animation. I enjoyed it every bit as much as Miyazaki's other films, with the same brilliant dream world slight-of-hand that surprises you at every turn. Miyazaki has affection for even his most selfish characters, setting him apart from other animated features which still insist that all characters are either good or evil. It's important for young audiences to learn that bad actions aren't motivated by evil but by real human needs and emotions. If there is one message that needs to be shared in our world today, this is it.",9,1,2,22 February 2006
