The Blair Witch Project," Nothing can prepare you for the fright of your life.
","When I was nine, I saw a movie called Children of the Corn. It gave me nightmares for weeks.  In the fifteen years that followed, I have seen almost every horror and slasher film that was made.  Not once have I been that unsettled from a movie... then came The Blair Witch Project.Let me start by saying that this movie doesn't follow the conventional 'rules' for a horror movie.  There is no nudity, no sex, or no music.  But don't let that stop you from watching it, you will be frightened.The story is told from the eyes of two cameras that the student filmmakers carried with them on the filming of a documentary. There is no 'phantom' camera like there is in every other movie ever made.  I feel that this adds to the realism and terror of the film.  You see what they see, you feel what they feel, and you fear what they fear.This movie is so terrifying and feels so real that there is a constant debate on the Internet if this is just a movie or actual footage.  Let me end all the rumors now.  It's only a movie...   but I doubt that will help you sleep easier after you watch it.  It will chill you to the bone.If you hate 'low budget movies' don't watch this movie, and if you don't like restless nights worrying about what might be lurking in the woods, then be sure not to watch it!It's original, it's unique, and it will scare you to death.  My vote is a perfect 10.",10,1,2,16 July 1999
