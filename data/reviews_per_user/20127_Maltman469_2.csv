The Ring," Holy bleeping bleep.
","Reviews for this movie are hilarious. 'Scarier than The Sixth Sense'. 'Doesn't have any comic relief whatsoever'. And the funniest of them all? 'It's bad'. I don't recall ever being so scared at a movie since I hit the age of maybe 11, and for a PG-13 no less? Not much blood, but amazing sound work and visuals, as well as a superb plot, leave it as one of the best movies of the year. Plus there were the occasional joke that left the audience cracking up. A good portion of the movie I saw through my hat, but I was standing and applauding as it ended. It makes the Sixth Sense look like Purple People Eater (no offense to PPE). 10 outta 10.

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," If only it wasn't as funny...
","If Pirates of the Caribbean was a more serious flick, without the laughoutloud subtle humor and hilarious parts that everyone loved, I guarantee you, Johnny Depp would have had an Oscar Nomination. His performance was inspired, entertaining, and strong. If he was the only thing the movie was worth seeing for, it'd easily be a 7/10, but the other lead roles were pulled off well, and the story was very entertaining. Against a movie like AI, for instance, this 2 hour plus movie flew right by. I only hope they don't butcher the sequal.10/10",10,0,1,15 July 2003
