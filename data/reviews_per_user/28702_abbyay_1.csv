It," THE BEST MOVIE
","I loved it since the first time i've seen it my friend is obsessed with jack grazer
and she told me I HAD to watch it and I loved it
honestly I don't really like remakes but I feel like this movie has not even maybe been the best remake ever but has brought me and my
friends alot closer I love it so much that my mom gets made at me for watching it because I watch it like everyday lol and I dont think its rated R because I hate scary movies and this isnt even that scary more of creepy i love it though I think its more
like PG-13",10,0,3,6 February 2018
