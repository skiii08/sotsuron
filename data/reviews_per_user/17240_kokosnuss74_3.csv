Catch Me If You Can," Earthly Spielberg's delight
","Steven Spielberg, who has always fascinated us (not me,always) with his stories of the superhuman and the supernatural, capable of bringing a tear to our eye, triumphs this time with a well told story (apparently a true story, too) about a con-artist who managed to escape from the law for several years before he was caught and redeeming himself by helping the same law he once bended. Some of my friends who watched the movie before me have told me `it's nothing special'. After watching it myself, I understand why: they were expecting a comedy with unexpected send-ups and goofy turn of events. Thank God they were wrong. `Catch me if you can' doesn't try to teach us a moral lesson, or make us think a lot. It's just a story. And well told too. The cast is superb: Di Caprio has never been better (at least since `What's eating Gilbert Grape') and Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken have given an excellent support to the main character. You can sense Spielberg's hand in some parts, but overall it's a movie with a story you can enjoy without thinking what to expect next. My Rating: 4/5",Null,0,1,12 March 2003
Forrest Gump," Again,what's the point?
","I've seen this movie at least 4 or 5 times. I see at least once a year and try to figure out what's missing. The answer is always: nothing. And everything. This movie is over hyped, overproduced, and overacted. My friends who liked the movie say I missed the entire point. I don't think so. It starts with some shocking vulgar scenes of Forrest's youth such as his mother sleeping with the school's principal in order for her son to be accepted at a `normal school' and other kids bullying him around because he can't walk -or act- normally. Throughout the movie we see Forrest succeeding at everything he tries, not because he really tries, but because things seem to fall from the sky right in his hands. Example: he becomes wealthy after investing in an `apple company' which was in fact Apple computers. Oh, oh the irony. Plus to most viewers annoyance (yes even the ones who think the movie is a classic) he keeps faithful to his girlfriend Jenny, a personification of the decadence of 60's America, even after she dumps him badly a couple of times.He have taught Elvis to dance, he was a hero in Nam, he met President Kennedy, John Lennon, he unveiled the Watergate Scandal, he played ping-pong in communist China.question is.what didn't he do? The message seems to be: 'No matter how hard you try, there'll be some idiot better than you at everything'. Topped with some cheap tavern philosophy (life is like a box of chocolates) this movie is a butt aching doodle. Avoid it at all cost.",Null,3,6,12 November 2002
BASEketball," Whatizit?
","When you expect this much from a movie, you get disappointed. There's nothing seriously wrong with `BASEketball' (the blind kid, the drinking session before the operation, the SF teamÂ…) but you have to expect more from the creators of South Park and the director of `Airplaine!' and `Naked Gun' movies. This is an ambitious project, and it falls flat at being ambitious. Perhaps Trey Parker and Matt Stone should have kept faithful at the formula used in `Orgazmo': simplicity and sheer mockery. 	The plot: two losers enroll in a new sport that combines Baseball and Basketball (hence the title) and make it to the big leagues, and are seen as the ultimate sport heroes in a world where money and greed are in charge. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) and Doug Remer (Matt Stone) are owners of that sport's most successful team, and have to fight against the evil in tempts of tycoon Baxter Cain (Robert Vaughn). Meanwhile Cooper falls for social assistant (?) Jenna Reed (Yasmine Bleeth). Meanwhile Cain manages to corrupt Remer and Cooper is on his own to keep the sport genuine.	Overall, it's not without his charm; there are some funny scenes, and famous faces roll up every time (which makes one wonder how some movie makers have so many friends and others don't)  but the final result leaves a bad taste in one's mouth.",Null,2,5,11 August 2003
