The Rock," My favorite action movie of all time!
","I've watched this movie too many times to count and I'm always ready to watch it again.  It combines everything that makes a great action movie. The three top-billed actors do an extraordinary job of taking on the roles of Stanley Goodspeed, John Patrick Mason, and General Francis X. Hummel.  We are offered Nicholas Cage in one of the few action roles that he triumphs in, as Goodspeed.  He may not be the typical tough skinned action hero, but he responds to the threats with a realistic amazement. 
Add Ed Harris in an uncharacteristic action film role as Hummel and it gets better.  We are given a United States General as a villain which leaves us asking, 'Why is he doing this?'.  Like many action movies, one would think that this is where the action simmers down and a bit of drama takes over. In this case, it does turn dramatic, but with the great work of Harris, each line is delivered with fierce conviction that the action truly never stops.Finally, we are given Sean Connery as ex-SAS operative, John Patrick Mason. It could have been a role with no more than one dimension, but that's not what you'll find here!  He is a mythical character who accompanies Goodspeed, and as they take on the evil element, they find that they learn a little bit more about themselves thanks to each other.",10,1,1,18 April 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," I didn't like it, but I still watch it when it's on
","It's one of those movies that when I'm asked about it I say, 'I thought it was kind of slow and boring'.  For some reason, when I found out that it was being broadcast commercial free and in letterbox format, I just had to see it.  Even as I'm typing this I'm watching the 'beyond the infinite' part and found myself doing other chores during the first hour of the film.  I've read other reviews that have proclaimed this the greatest science fiction film ever made and nothing will ever come close.  It makes me sad to read this because that means that only a handful of people can enjoy science fiction and I believe that this is not true.  Arthur C. Clarke has said that even he doesn't know the definition of 'science fiction', but I believe that a movie using the aid of computers, like Starship Troopers, is fine science fiction.  For some reason, part of the reason that this film is so highly praised is because of its beautiful filmaking and that is something I can agree with on some level.  There were times that I was asking myself, 'How did he do that?'  But this couldn't convince me to announce my worship to Stanley Kubrick like so many others have done.  I enjoy a mysterious movie that raises more questions than answers, but unfortunately I don't enjoy the ongoing search for themes and plots.",Null,3,6,31 December 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," Greatest Movie of All Time
","What can I say that hasn't been said.  The beauty of this movie can hardly be put into words.  The more I watch it, the better it gets.  Mr. Darabont did a beautiful job of directing, I'm anxiously awaiting 'The Green Mile' now.  The little scenes are what makes it beautiful.  Andy on the roof with his smile and the aerial shot of the prison while the music is playing.  I don't want to spoil anything, but the quotes are what will stay with you. After seeing this film (way too many times according to those around me), I've adopted my particular philosophy from it.  As Red says, 'Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'.  That's goddamn right'.  See this movie and vote it back up to #1 on the IMDB list.",10,0,0,22 September 1999
The Thin Red Line," Sit through it, it will be worth it
","Anytime someone asks me if this is a good movie, all I can say is that they have to see it for themselves.  Yes, it's a long movie.  Yes, the bankable stars make small cameos.  Yes, there isn't much fighting.  BUT, if you stay till the end and appreciate the cinematography and direction, it will change your outlook on the world around you.  If you get a chance, watch this film and put aside some time to reflect on it.  Hell, watch it twice just so you can anticipate the dialogue and enjoy it.  It will remind you of the beautiful light.",9,0,0,22 December 1999
