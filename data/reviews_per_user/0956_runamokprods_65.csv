Whip It," Sweet, fun, and good natured
","Likable' could be seen as a lukewarm compliment for a film. 'Cute' could even be a backhanded pit-down. But this film is likable and cute in a very good way. The story of an off-beat 17 year old, well played by Ellen Page, finding herself by secretly joining the roller derby in Austin, Texas may be clichéd on the surface, but the lovely character detail and successfully offbeat casting make the film a quirky, likable winner. Not a great film, nor an 'important' one, but one I enjoyed and was never bored by. And at a time where most Hollywood 'entertainment' centers around blowing stuff up, its nice to see a mainstream film with rich characters and a big heart.",Null,5,7,31 October 2011
Love and Death," Brilliant satire. Arguably Allen's best pure comedy.
","I'm not surprised this was rumored to be Allen's favorite film. I'd say it's the best of his flat out comedies. All the strengths he was gathering as a filmmaker came together in this brilliant satire of (among other things) 19th century Russian literature, war, epic films about war, Ingmar Bergman, etc. etc. It's very very smart, and very very funny.An amazing mix of sophisticated intellectual verbal comedy, parody, low and high-brow visual gags (from speeded up film of bopping a character repeatedly over the head with a bottle, to homages to great images from early Russian films) , terrific cinematography, and some real ideas, both political and philosophical. Diane Keaton is wonderful, and fully comes into her own as Allen's on screen equal partner. And the look of the film shows the deep visual sophistication that would become a hallmark of the next phase of Allen's career; Annie Hall, Manhattan, etc. With this film Allen completed his journey from brilliant joke teller to brilliant director-writer. It would be his next film, Annie Hall, that would make the world realize he was a world class filmmaker. But you can see the all groundwork laid here, and have a lot of fun in the process.It's shocking to me that as of this writing, the DVD seems to be out-of-print in the U.S. I can only assume that's a temporary situation, but you might want to try and grab a copy now, just in case.",10,1,1,18 June 2010
Requiem for a Dream," Flawed, but thrilling film-making
","Amazing on a purely cinematic level – assaultive, hyper-kinetic, full of breathtaking images and cuts, The performances too range from good (Jared Leto) to extraordinary (Ellen Burstyn). But for me, after a while, the style becomes the substance, and I'm ever more aware of the filmmaking rather than the story and characters,Also, other than 'drugs are bad', I'm not sure what Aronofsky is really getting at. There are interesting implications that our real addiction is to our dreams, and escaping whatever our reality is, but those themes are never fully played out. So we end up with a film made with the technical skill of a Scorsese or Kubrick, but missing a layer of depth in favor of (admittedly amazing) pyrotechnics. Last, it feels like the film 'cheats' more on reality as it goes along. By the end the story twists start to join the style in being over the top, and a bit illogical. Now, all that carping aside, I still recommend this film for it's bravery, performances, and technical virtuosity. And it grew on me on a 2nd viewing. And I'm a fan of Aronofsky's. But I'm in the minority in admiring this film, but not being able to completely embrace it.",8,1,2,24 April 2011
Friday Night Lights," One of the best sports movies of recent years
","Almost everything works in this portrait of the madness for and around high-school football in a small Texas town. One of the best sports movies I've seen, largely because it's not really about the sport, or the big game, or winning and losing. It's about growing up, letting go of dreams, the pressure adults put on kids to fulfill their own dreams, losing perspective and gaining it. It seems to try and honestly look at both sides of high school football; how it helps young men grow, challenge themselves and bond, but at the same time how it subjects them to physical harm, an unrealistic set of expectations about life after being a local star, and being forced to carry a whole town on your shoulders when you're only 17. Some terrific visuals, both in the quick cutting ferocity of the games, and in the long aerial views of the empty Texas plains. It does cheat in a few moments, trying to have it's cake and eat it too – a few plot lines are resolved a touch too easily or neatly, a few plot twists feel too familiar from other films. And I understand those that say the film displays a superior attitude towards these small town people. But I found those weaker moments fleeting in a film that surprised me with the strength of it's acting, writing, and filmmaking.",9,4,7,2 April 2012
The Impossible," An amazing story, but some questions about the telling
","Amazing effects and stunts, along with and solid performances balance out some artistic lapses and ethical questions in this true story of one family's experiences of the horrendous Tsunami that killed 300,000. The downsides; there's something a little off-putting about choosing a white, privileged family as a focus, while at the same time showing almost exclusively other white people as suffering and afraid in a disaster that killed far more local people than tourists. The Thai's are certainly shown in a good light, kindly helping all these suffering whites, but even in the hospital, almost every face we see in a bed is a white one. That hint of odd racial insensitivity is also underlined by replacing the original family, who were Spanish and dark, and making them into a gorgeous blond English family, a telling choice in a 'true' story. On a more general level, the film can feel manipulative, from the tear jerking score, to the multiple carefully framed 'will they spot each other?' shots that feel like a horror film's self-conscious suspense fames, but that cinematic technique feels distractingly artificial in this more naturalistic setting. There's no question it's exciting and at times quite moving, but I couldn't help thinking I might have felt even more deeply if it wasn't pushing so hard to control my emotions.",7,314,470,6 December 2012
Argo," Intelligent, nail-biting and darkly comic
","Ben Affleck continues to prove himself one of our best, most intelligent 'mainstream' film- makers. In Argo he manages to combine nail-biting suspense created with a minimum of violence or standard movie action, a sharp, dark sense of humor about the weirdness of both espionage and Hollywood, and makes a film about getting American hostages released without giving in to jingoism. Affleck even takes the time at the beginning of the film to put the Iranian revolution into a larger context of American involvement, thus making the Iranians' hostage taking horribly wrong, but also somewhat human and understandable. The story itself is a doozey, and definitely fits into the 'you'd never believe it if it weren't true' mold. Using a fake movie as a cover-up for a long- shot rescue operation sounds like a bad episode of 'Mission Impossible' (or even 'Get Smart'). But here it is, a part of history. I have only two small complaints about the film. First, other than Alan Arkin's and John Goodman's deliciously funny performances as the Hollywood end of the deal, not many of the other characters are given as much texture as they might, especially considering how strong the cast is. Perhaps the fear was slowing down the film with character details, but I would have gladly watched a few minutes more to know these people better on a human level. More problematically there are a number of key moments where the suspense is trumped up needlessly by throwing in some very 'Hollywood' conceits (coincidences, physical impossibilities, a climax that diverges pretty far from historical accuracy in pursuing 'drama' etc) in a film that didn't need them, a film where the whole point is how real world spy operations are miles from what we usually see in films. Neither of these flaws seriously damage a very, very good film, but I couldn't help some minor disappointment when I felt the film go for the 'movie moment' over truth. But this is still a highly entertaining and intelligent thriller, and that's to be applauded.",8,3,6,24 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," I seem to be going against the trend here...
","As much as I liked Abrams' 2009 re-boot of the Star Trek series, I liked this second installment better. I think that's because there was less of an obligation to fill up back-story, and more ability to go deeper both into plot, and into the emotions of these new, younger versions of the characters we now (re) know. Add to that Benedict Cumberbatch makes a complex and compelling villain, even if the character does borrow from other sources, including Rutger Hauer in 'Blade Runner'. The humor is funny, the emotional scenes have a real impact, the battles are exciting, the acting is excellent, the plot twists are clever, and the more epic 'big' moments are really effective. There are flaws; some plot twists can be seen coming a mile off, there are a few painful cheats or jumps in logic, and a handful of too-easy coincidences. But for a big summer blockbuster this has more smarts, style, punch and humanity than most.",8,8,11,2 February 2014
127 Hours," Masterfully directed and acted
","On one level there's no reason this film should work as well as it does. The story is public knowledge so there's no real suspense in the traditional sense. But between the brilliant direction by Danny Boyle, and the smashing performance by James Franco this transcends to be not a film of suspense, but a character study of a very real, flawed but likable person in a nightmare situation any of us can imagine. We descend into his lonely hell with him and emerged amazed by the resilience of this young man in particular, but also by life in general. Less thrilling, but – more important – far more moving than I expected, Boyle works wonders in making what is essential a one character single location film never feel static or dull, and the gruesome climax almost unbearable to watch without ever feeling exploitive.",9,1,1,7 October 2013
Batman Returns," A Tim Burton film, more than a Batman film - which isn't necessarily a bad thing
","Re-watching the two Burton 'Batman's I was shocked to find I liked 'Batman Returns' more than the 1st. True, the film has nothing to compare with the wonderful over-the-top craziness of Jack Nicholson as the Joker, but in some ways Nicholson so overpowered the 1st film that it felt out of balance. At the same time, and – for me – even more problematic were the very un-Tim Burton like touches (the Prince songs? the endless, not very exciting climactic battle, the weak CGI) that seemed grafted on to make some studio executive happy.'Batman Returns' seems much more a Tim Burton film; weirder, more perverse, funnier and more unpredictable than its predecessor. While the film lacks Nicholson's magic, it gains a great, funny, and twistedly sexy performance by Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, her dark, dual personality mirroring Batman/Bruce Wayne's schizophrenic existence, and drawing these two 'enemies' together like moths to flame.Also fun and often fascinating are Danny DeVito's so pathetic you could almost like him, but so dark he's unredeemable Penguin. And Christopher Walken is a blast comparatively underplaying evil capitalist billionaire Max Schrek. The film looks gorgeous, arguably better than the first. And if the production design can't match the grandeur of Anton Furst's sets for 'Batman'. these have a lot more Tim Burton surrealist fun-house/nightmare aesthetic. What's missing is much of a clear plot, story elements coming and going a bit randomly. And, like the first film, 'Batman' himself is made less interesting than the bad guys. But Burton has always been at his best exploring outsider characters, and creating nightmare dreamscapes, and he gets to do a lot more of that here. As one critic put it; this is a somewhat weaker 'Batman' film, but a much better Tim Burton film.",7,1,3,14 September 2014

Match Point," Smart, tense, but not quite 'Crimes and Misdemeanors'
","Intelligent, tense, frosty drama with thriller overtones. It's very good, but three things hold it back from being flat out terrific: 1) Scarlett Johanssen is fair in a role that needed somebody great. She's sexy all right, but there's a necessary layer of complexity missing. 2) There are some big logic holes in the last 1/3 that rely on us buying a lot of coincidence and 3) Allen has basically already made the same film much more deeply and inventively in Crimes and Misdemeanors. Still, for all it's flaws, one of the better and more interesting films of 2005.",8,1,1,8 July 2010
Midnight in Paris," Luminous and charming
","A charming, sweet film, that explores the nature of nostalgia (its glow and its darker shadows), and shows off Paris, both modern day, and in the 1920s, almost as beautifully as Manhattan showed off New York. Laced with wonderful cameo and supporting performances (Adrien Brody, Kathy Bates, Marion Cotillard, Corey Stoll, just to name a few) and gifted by a quirky, lovably sad Owen Wilson as a sort of Eyeore of a struggling writer in the lead. Wilson is probably the best stand in yet for Allen in one of his films, precisely because he's so different from Allen, and doesn't seem to be doing an Allen impersonation. (Even Allen admitted that part of the appeal in casting Wilson was casting someone so far from himself).The 94 minutes of the film flew by, and never lost it's charm. A number of professional critics noted that this was a new tone for Allen, neither laugh out loud comedy, nor serious drama (or, as in his greatest films a combination of the two), but is more of a light drama, with a gentle comic whimsy. I actually think Allen started exploring this interesting new tone with his last film 'You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger' And it does seem to have reinvigorated him. I did have a couple of problems with the film. First, Rachel McAdams as Wilson's fiancé, along with her family, were made too caraciturish, too obviously 'bad' for a film this subtle. McAdams is a brilliant actress, but here she seems pushed into being a symbol of all that's wrong with shallow, materialistic Americans. More problematically, after gently, subtly exploring it's themes for the whole film, Allen suddenly starts laying them on very thick at the end, putting them very literally into the dialogue, almost as if he doesn't trust us to be smart enough to get the point of the whole lovely film he just showed us. But these are minor complaints, and while this may not be one of Allen's great films, it is a very good one, and that makes is special and worth seeking out.",Null,1,2,20 November 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," I liked this. A lot. But I wish I could have outright loved it.
","The acting is impeccable. Gary Oldman completely disappears into the role of Smiley; the voice, the walk, the tempo are all a unique creation, a man who's strength comes from quiet, from watching, from thinking, not from action. Rarely have we ever seen a movie hero this passive. But this man is very actively passive. He may not move physically, but his mind is racing like a computer. And Oldman is surrounded by a top flight cast;; Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, Ciaran Hinds, Benedict Cumberpatch, etc. And the film is very well shot, delicately creating a dour world of beige and brown mazes. But in distilling a story this complex down to two hours, something got a little lost for me. Smiley has to figure out who the mole in the British secret service is. But with this much plot, and this little time, we don't really get to know the suspects. So we watch and are (intentionally) confused, and then answers start to emerge, and it's all never less than interesting. But somehow it never crosses over into the emotional or unshakably memorable either. I loved Alfredson's 'Let the Right One In' for it's uncanny combination of atmosphere, creepiness, intelligence and heart. For me, 'Tinker, Tailor' has the first three, but lacks the last. Some of that is the nature of LaCarre's work. But somehow I remember more moments, and more feeling from the now 30+ year old TV adaptation. Paradoxically, by not having to rush through a story this dense, there was room to really feel and experience it, instead of just working to keep up with it and take it in. But all that said, this is a refreshingly smart, adult, well-made and challenging film in a world with far too few.",8,1,2,9 February 2012
MASH," Clearly an important part of film history, but the years haven't been kind to it (in my eyes)
","I should probably watch this again, since so many consider it a masterpiece. Maybe I was over-prepared (Hey, it took me a second viewing of 'Citizen Kane' to get my past pre-set expectations!). But while I could see why M*A*S*H was groundbreaking and important for a Hollywood film of it's day (lack of the usual clear narrative line, anti-war stance, overlapping, improvised dialogue, sexuality, bloody operating room scenes serving as ironic counterpart, etc), it felt pretty dated and unfocused. There are some very funny moments, but a lot of the ironies seem easy, and there's a lack of a true darker underpinnings and ideas, unlike, say, 'Dr. Strangelove'. A lot of the humor is juvenile, cruel and silly. And while I get that's the point – nothing can be more deeply juvenile, cruel and silly than war, it got repetitive and heavy handed after a while. The performances are good, but beyond Robert Duvall, none of the characters have much in the way of dimensions. People stay exactly what we think they are from the moment we meet them. Walter Chow makes a good argument on the web site 'Film Freak Central', that the sexism, homophobia, etc are the whole point. Altman is saying we're ALL beasts at heart, even if we act like we're bucking the system. It's an interesting idea, but I'm not sure I buy it's what Altman was intending.",7,28,36,8 August 2010

Knocked Up," hat rare thing, a modern Hollywood comedy with a heart
","Much like Judd Apatow's preceding film 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', this takes a silly high concept Hollywood idea (slacker slob impregnates upper class hottie, and in spite of all odds they have the baby and fall in love), injects it with both high and low-brow humor, pathos, good acting, and real insight. Seth Rogan is terrific, but so is Catherine Heigel, Paul Rudd, and everyone in the big supporting cast.On second viewing I experienced it as having more heart but fewer laughs than I remembered - an OK trade off. Also, a couple of plot jumps bugged me a bit more - the fact that abortion is never even really considered or even discussed feels like a dodge, and the transition of this unlikely twosome into a couple, even an awkward one feels a bit quickly skipped over for a film that runs over 2 hours. But neither of those points are enough to really hurt a sweet and wonderful character comedy.Side note: I saw the 129 min theatrical version the 1st time around and the 133 min version on the blu-ray the 2nd.",9,0,0,6 October 2016
The Town," Familiar, but very well done
","A strong, fun and very well detailed crime thriller, but not nearly as subtle or emotionally and morally complex as Affleck's earlier 'Gone Baby Gone'. There's a lot of cliché's here, especially in the third act; car chases, huge over-the-top .shootouts which, while well handled, make this feel much more like a familiar Hollywood movie. Also, some of the supporting characters fall into 'types' we've seen so many times before, something 'Gone Baby Gone' generally avoided very well, despite being a hard boiled detective thriller, hardly an under-done genre. Indeed, a lot of this film, including the main plot itself treads familiar water, but it does it with enough grown up intelligence, good acting, and specificity to let us get caught up anyway. And at least, by the end a few of the 'obvious' set ups, have led us somewhere different than the standard Hollywood treatment would lead us to expect. I just hope Affleck, an obviously extremely talented film-maker, returns to the kind of thematically richer and more original material he mined in his first film.",7,0,1,23 December 2010
Suicide Squad," Better than I expected, but far from what it might have been
","Maybe it was the vicious reviews that led me to over compensate and be somewhat pleasantly surprised by this. Of course, I'm not the core audience, being well into middle age and not generally a fan of the comic book movie universe. That once very entertaining world now feels played out and repetitive to me, no matter how high tech the special effects. But I did love Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy- largely for hijacking and making fun of the formulas. And that's probably why I liked (not loved) Suicide Squad. While not as successful at biting the hand that bore it as those other two comic films that refused to play by the rules, it still has fun with darkness and light and all our preconceptions about heroes and villains. Indeed, it could have been flat out terrific, but two substantive problems held it back. First, the core plot is as silly, illogical and uninspiring as any in the weakest of the genre. Just because the film is more about the characters than the story doesn't mean there's couldn't have been something a little more imaginative to hang the tale on.And, perhaps even more damningly, for a film that purports to be a sort of 'Dirty Dozen' of the comic book world, its villains turned anti-heroes are nowhere near 'anti' enough. They're all entertaining lightweights in the moral division. If they've done bad things you can be sure it was always for good reasons and/or they feel really bad about it. Instead of forcing us into the juicy, morally messy joy of forcing us relate to some really bad 'heroes', these are more misunderstood victims with superpowers then Walter Whites who happen to also be able to make things fly or explode. And that's too bad, because with more bite, edge and embrace of punky anarchy this could have been that rare popcorn movie is truly subversive, instead one that mildly, if sometimes entertainingly, play acts at it.",7,1,2,26 February 2017
Gone Baby Gone," One of the stronger Hollywood mysteries of recent years
","Wonderfully ambiguous, uncompromised, morally complex story of young private eye involved with a local kidnapping case. Terrific performances from Casey Affleck, Amy Ryan, Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman et al. Also note worthy is the film's great sense of place. The world of the film feels real, and not like a tinsel-town projection of a working class Boston neighborhood. Ben Affleck brings surprising subtlety and depth to his directorial debut, and ends up making one of the most intelligent Hollywood mysteries in recent years. There are flaws; the last 1/3 isn't quite as strong in terms of plot â€“ a few twists hard to swallow. And the 'girlfriend' role is written a little thin for a film where most characters are so filled out. But the film leaves us shaken and thinking. How many recent films can you say that about?",9,0,0,21 May 2010
Léon: The Professional," That rarest of film creatures, something unique.
","Determinedly, odd, over the top and a lot of fun., This strangely sentimental, wonderfully photographed, very violent black comedy is like some demented marriage of a sincere Disney film about a 12 year old girl looking for a father (or, in an intentionally disquieting French twist, a lover), with the over the top darkness of David Lynch, or Kubrick in his 'Dr. Strangelove' mode, and some John Woo action thrown in for good measure. Sound weird? Well, it is, and there are some huge logic jumps and gaping plot holes. But the film disarms those potential problems by never pretending to be the world as we know it, but creating a heightened, strange, through- the-looking-glass reality where hit men are sweet softies at heart, and New York cops are not only corrupt but openly bat-sh@t insane, gunning down whomever gets in their way with gleeful abandon. Gary Oldman goes way, way over the top as the baddie, and is a blast in the process. Jean Reno creates some real pathos in his sad faced, killer, who is so alone that he's almost child-like in his having to learn to relate to another human, and Natalie Portman gives a shockingly complex performance for an actress so young, playing so tricky a role. A film I could understand someone hating if they didn't get into Besson's decidedly off-beat vibe, but if you go with it, it's that rarest of film creatures, something unique.",8,2,2,21 December 2013
The Orphanage," Moody, emotional, intelligent and well acted horror
","Well above average haunted house film. As emotional as it is scary.The same could be said of most of producer Guillermo Del Toro's films. The story feels a little too familiar for most of it's length to quite make it too classic film status, although the last 10 minutes do elevate it to something more moving and more thoughtful than 95%of the genre pictures currently being made.Wonderfully acted by Belen Rueda, as a mother whose child mysteriously disappears. Well shot as well.The kind of film I look forward to re-watching, sure that now that I know its secrets, there's even more to be uncovered.",8,6,9,7 December 2011
The Machinist," Grew with a re-watch
","An amazing performance by Christian Bale, a very good one by Jennifer Jason Leigh, and a cool, effective, desaturated look make for an interesting film. A man who has hardly slept for a year goes further and further into his own paranoia, as he, and we, question his sanity. It works quite well as a psychological thriller, setting up a really creepy, unique, dreamlike mood for most of it's length.But the ending is so neat, and ties up the loose ends in such an obvious way that it takes a bit away from all that precedes it. It did improve for me on a second viewing, where, knowing the ending I could appreciate it more for what it was, rather than being disappointed in what it wasn't.",8,0,1,10 September 2016
The Lego Movie," Wild, smart, creative and great fun -- with a heart
","One of my very favorite films of 2014. What I worried would be a feature length commercial is instead a very funny, and somewhat subversive film, overflowing with ideas, puns, perfect music, and wacky 'cameos' by everyone from Shaquile O'Neil, to a wonderfully warped and dark Batman (given terrific voice by Will Arnet). 'Lego' doesn't look quite like any film I've seen before. It has a rough, almost bizarrely low- tech look to it's Lego people -- stop motion that looks like stop motion --oddly (but very effectively) combined with mind-blowingly huge and complicated shots of the Lego universe in action. Somehow in the unlikely mix of slickness and lo-fi something wonderful is created; animation that is wildly impressive, but also clearly human, creative and DIY at the same time.The film is basically a spoof of every Hollywood vision-quest movie you've ever seen. You know the films. A young character (almost always male) is called on to save the world/neighborhood/kingdom. He's over-matched, and under prepared, but with a kindly older mentor of great power to guide him, you know he will find a way to prevail. Except here the 'special' character at the center really ISN'T very special. He's a young working guy like a million others, who's not very bright or especially brave, and who just wants to live his happy, blank, endlessly repetitive safe life. And the mentor? None other than the voice of Morgan Freeman, expertly spoofing his own image as the ultimate voice of wisdom. He plays a wizard who is far less consistently brilliant and all knowing than he claims or wants to be. He's very, very funny, which is not the first thing one thinks of with Morgan Freeman. The same could be said of Liam Neeson, who also does a great voice job as the good cop/bad cop, who's personality changes depending on what side of his head is facing front. Will Ferrell is also excellent as the villain of the piece, being just silly enough to be funny, but just real enough to give the story some real tension. Not everything works, and there were a few spots near the end where the energy flagged. But overall this is an exciting and creative (and wonderfully fun) piece of film-making, that manages to attack the near fascist mentality of a society obsessed with consuming, and determined not to question it's own lives (it's not for nothing that the villain's name is 'President Business')-- while still being very funny, and almost never feeling like its preaching. And without giving anything away, in the last 20 minutes it changes the rules again, and asks a few profound questions about the nature of existence, without seeming like it had suddenly jumped the track as a film for kids as well as adults.In the end, I walked around with the hysterical, awful (in a great way), and when you think about it kinda dark anthem 'Everything is Awesome' banging around in my head for days.",9,0,2,16 January 2015
Aliens," A lot of tense, scary fun
","It's interesting to compare Ridley Scott's 'Alien' to James Cameron's sequel. Both are extremely well made films, from world class directors. But each also reflects the very different sensibilities of the two. 'Alien' is colder, more precise, more haunting and disturbing. 'Aliens' is a thrill ride from start to end, faster paced, more muscular and energetic, less serious, and sloppier – in ways both good and bad - than it's progenitor.It sometimes pushes the emotions into the 'sappy' range, one of it's few flaws, along with a few big logic holes, and a couple of obvious twists. But the film-making is so confident, and downright fun that it becomes infectious, even if you try to resist it. It can make the 'gee- whiz' kid in you win out over the critical adult. The plot in some ways is a re-run of the first, but now instead of humans being helpless victims, they are Marines going to war with a creature they don't understand, and initially don't take seriously enough. There's also a nice feminist streak to the film, present in the original, but expanded on here. Not only is Sigourney Weaver's Ripley tougher and smarter than just about every male on display, but the most kick-ass of all the kick-ass Marines is also a woman (Jenette Goldstein in a terrific performance). I enjoyed Cameron's extended cut (his preferred version) on the blu-ray. The newer version didn't feel too long, but did feel more flowing and complete, giving us some important insights into Ripley's character. The blu-ray's image is terrific and very sharp, but that does tend to show up the crude nature of some of the early CGI work. I was also bothered by how much of the film seemed as if the dialogue had to be re-recorded in post production, the 'looped' dialogue somehow sounding a bit un-natural. If not a 'great' film, a very enjoyable, tense action blockbuster, back when solid acting, clever writing and high end craftsmanship were still important, even in a sequel.",8,2,3,27 November 2014
Gandhi," A good film about a great man
","If only the film was a little deeper, a little more complex, it could have been an all time great epic. As it is, it comes close. The pluses; the power of the story and the history, and Ben Kingsley's amazing performance, which, somehow, like Gandhi himself, is both modest and incredibly powerful. The minuses; many of the supporting characters are underdeveloped, sometimes to the point of caricature. Most of the 'villains' (the British, the leader of the Muslim separatist movement) are presented as one dimensional cartoons that Gandhi himself probably would have disapproved of as lacking compassion and understanding. Also, there's a feeling, despite it's 3+hour length, that we really never get to know Gandhi as a human being, not just a 'great, historic figure'. The best moments in the film are his moments of self-doubt and questioning, as well as his complex family life, but those are few and far between. Still, an epic telling of one of the most important, influential and inspiring people of the last 500 years.",8,1,1,26 June 2011
The Dirty Dozen," Entertaining, cynical and subtly subversive
","This entertaining, tense, yet very cynical view of war is as subversive in it's own quiet way as M*A*S*H is overtly. To take a bunch of murderers, rapists, thieves, then make us root for them as war heroes, and laugh at their antics, then get caught up in their mission but (if we catch it) feel an unease at how that mission quietly echoes the gassing of Jews in concentration camps leads to high number of levels at which to take the film leads to a very complicated movie experience masquerading at 'fun' entertainment. And it IS fun -- that's where Aldrich pulls you in. Yet to admit even subtly (as he also did in 'Attack') that even a war as 'good', just and necessary as WWII was still an act of insanity on all sides may be even more brave than Altman's more overt counter-culture skewering of the Korean War, a war more 'acceptable' to ask moral questions about. All that said, as often happens for me with Aldrich, it lost a bit on second viewing. The humor felt more juvenile, the ironies a bit easy. Still a cool, subversive film, but I'd hoped it would grow, not fade.",7,5,8,26 July 2016
District 9," A commercial action sci-fi film that's also smart, political, darkly funny, and at moments very touching,
","Blomkamp does the amazing by combing roller coaster excitement with an intelligent context that makes all the noise about something. While some of the ideas are occasionally heavy handed or on the nose, it's so exciting to see a Hollywood action film that traffics in ideas, that I'm willing to forgive the occasional 'I get it already' moment, or logic lapse, or easy coincidence, or mediocre supporting performance. The story is simple. A million plus grotesque looking, starving and sickly aliens get stranded on Earth when they essentially run out of fuel. And while at first humans try to reach out in friendship, before long corporations are trying to make money by exploiting their technology (especially, or course, their weapons) and the aliens are herded into a 'district' and walled in. (That the film is set in South Africa is one of those choices that feels like gilding the lily – even though that is the film-makers home). And it's clear that progressing from apartheid to Nazi style medical experiments and concentration camps is the next step. While I wish the villains were less mustache twirling (some 'banality of evil' would have been even more chilling), the effects are great, and it's a film that grew, not shrank as it went along. For the first third I thought it was OK, the second pretty good, and by the end I loved it. And it's stuck with me.",9,2,4,11 October 2012
To Rome With Love," Not among Allen's greats, but still a lot of fun
","While not great Woody Allen – it's neither profound, moving nor funny enough for that title, it is quite enjoyable. The film is made up of four intercut short stories, that share little other than the fact they're set in Rome. Some have fantasy elements, some are more absurdist, others more straightforward character farce.But somehow, though they don't make much of a logical grouping, the whole thing is lighthearted and fun enough that it seems grumpy to pick on it. Sure some jokes fall flat and some ideas seem unfulfilled, but a lot of it is wonderfully acted and cleverly written. And at a time when so many comedies are aimed only at 15 year olds, even 2nd tier Woody, simply telling playfully comic tales, is a welcome sight.",8,55,69,9 November 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Funny, sweet, inventive and wonderfully acted
","A wonderfully funny fable of the adventures of world's greatest hotel concierge (a brilliant, inventive and hilarious performance by Ralph Fiennes) and the friendship he strikes up with the hotel's new lobby boy (a strong debut by newcomer Tony Revolori). The story goes in many unexpected directions, every one entertaining and eccentric, and the cast is full of first rate highly comic performances by F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, with terrific cameos by Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Jude Law and others I feel bad for forgetting here. While not Anderson's most profound film, it may be his most joyful. I don't think I stopped smiling from first frame to last, and I laughed out loud quite a few times. And yet, as in any good fable, there is some real poignancy as well. A top notch marriage of a lovingly crafted art-film and a wacky human comedy, something rarely pulled off with such panache. Even my friends who don't enjoy Anderson's work in general had nothing but good things to say. The sweetest treat of the movie year so far.",9,30,41,15 August 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," More fun than your average summer blockbuster
","Quite fun, with some very impressive, if improbable action sequences. It's been a while since I saw a climatic fight sequence go on so long and yet never get boring. It's a popcorn movie to be sure. The few brief attempts at emotional depth and back-story are probably the least successful element. The over-all plot feels like a leftover from a 1980's James Bond film. And it's not a film I can imagine the need to go back to and re-see. I don't think there are extra layers to be uncovered, and the very nifty stunt and CGI work can't have the same rush of adrenaline the second time around. But the action is deftly handled, the tension level high, the images are cool, and I got caught up in spite of myself. At least in a moment to moment way. As long as I didn't start up my bad habit of thinking about the 'big picture'.And I'll be honest, I'm not a 'summer blockbuster action movie' kinda guy. I'm old compared to the key audience this is aimed at. I'm more at home with the new Woody Allen movie or some dark drama from Russia. So take this review with the appropriate grain of salt. But that said, I can't deny I had a good time, and smiled lot.",7,0,2,28 August 2014
Foxcatcher," A deeply chilling and disturbing tone poem of a film.
","I can't remember when a non-horror film has made me feel so uncomfortable and tense for it's whole length. It's a quiet film. Slow. Subtle. Almost dreamlike. Much of what happens occurs without dialogue. But there is always a heavy feeling of doom floating over it's sad characters. And what a fascinating bunch of characters. Based on real people, I found myself wondering if a novelist could come up with a trio so laden with emotional and social meaning. John DuPont (Steve Carrell) is the mega millionaire who is vaguely 'off', and clearly fighting mental demons. He dreams of being a wrestling coach and somehow coaching America to glory, so he essentially buys a now down on his luck ex-champion Mark Shultz (Channing Tatum) to come and wrestle for him. The two men have a complicated and tricky relationship. There is admiration, father and son bonding, resentment and even seemingly unspoken sexual attraction. But neither man is able to communicate about almost any of it, or deal with any of the feelings themselves. The third member of the triumvirate is Shultz's older brother Dave (Mark Rufflao). Less of a painful introvert than his brother, Dave has been Mark's coach and only friend. They have a complex filial relationship, captured beautifully by director Bennett Miller and writers Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye in the lengthy, almost wordless opening scene where Dave leads Mark through a training session. Just as messy, if healthier, than Mark's relationship with DuPont, we see in the scene the love, admiration, jealousy and rivalry that exists between these two quiet men. Now Dave joins Mark at DuPont's vast compound to be 'assistant coach' to DuPont's 'coach', which is deeply bizarre as it quickly becomes clear that Dave knows 10 times as much about both wresting and leadership as DuPont ever will. As we watch a frustrated DuPont quietly head into an ever darker place the tension grows as thick as in a Polanski film, and even the film's conclusion provides little in the way of release. I headed back out into the night with a knot still in my stomach. It's the rare film that can pull me into that kind of claustrophobic space of madness and loss.A word has to be given to the tremendous work done by all three actors, along with Vanessa Redgrave as DuPont's mother -- unforgettable in a role that only gives her a few minutes of screen time. While Carrell has gotten the lion's share of the kudos (and he is terrific, reinventing himself as a purely dramatic actor) both Tatum and Ruffalo also do world class work here, creating inarticulate men who express with their eyes and bodies what they don't quite know how to express with words.This is not a 'fun' movie, but it is one that you can feel deeply, and end up pondering the nature of madness, success, the American dream, family in a way too few American films do.",9,4,11,16 January 2015
28 Days Later...," Is there any genre Danny Boyle can't do?
","A very well made, thinking person's zombie movie. This avoids most of the silliest elements of the genre, adds some very clever twists, and interesting complex characters. It still doesn't quite rise to being a great movie, through a combination of not really exploring the many political and social themes it hints at (George Romero takes that further), and pushing its internal logic pretty far at times. But it's always entertaining, has a lot of genuine suspense, and isn't over- reliant on easy scares and shocks. Interestingly photographed on video. I would have rated this even higher if it had one of the darker, more emotional and complex endings included on the DVD special features. That would have brought it to 'classic' status.",8,2,3,23 September 2013
Frozen," A truly charming and fun animated film
","A charming and great looking loose adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson's 'The Snow Queen' this animated gem from Disney has a lot going for it; catchy songs that are strong in both music and lyrics, terrific voice acting (I like that they bucked the trend of jamming in the most famous names they could in favor of actors who sound perfect as the characters), actually surprising plot twists, some real emotion, some witty humor, some dark and scary moments that don't pull all their punches, and most of all some really beautiful images using snow and ice. Jennifer Lee is, surprisingly, the first woman to (co) direct an animated feature for Disney, so it may be not for nothing that the film has a likable 'girl power' attitude, where the princesses take no back seat to the male characters in bravery or in action. The story involves two sisters, the eldest of whom has magical powers that can turn things to ice or snow, control the weather, and even, if used wrong, be deadly. So after an accidental near miss with her adored younger sibling, the two are kept separate, and grow up with decidedly different personalities. The film then jumps forward to the day of the eldest's coronation as queen. This brings joy to the younger, extroverted and lonely sister, as the palace will finally be opened, and she can see the world (and maybe fall in love), but dread to her older sister who fears not being able to control her powers, and being discovered as some sort of (unwilling) sorceress. Of course things do go awry, leading to all kinds of adventure and miss-adventure. There are the inevitable cliché's here and there, and a few bits seem stolen from other animated films, but these are very minor problems in a film that I thoroughly enjoyed, even though I'm many times older than the intended audience.",9,3,7,23 December 2013
Room," Haunting, powerful, beautifully done
","Irish filmmaker Lenny Abrahamson has been making terrific films since 2004. 'Adam & Paul', 'Garage', 'What Richard Did' are all excellent small films, marked by top rate acting and rich characters. With the oddly funny and surreal 'Frank', Abrahamson finally started to get some attention here in the states. 'Room' may be his strongest film yet -- a vertigo inducing mix of thriller like tension and complex and sometimes disturbing character studies. Again, he gets great performances; from the young and extremely talented Brie Larson, to great old pros like Joan Allen and William H. Macy, to a remarkable performance from a child, Jacob Tremblay, in a seriously difficult and demanding part. I've seen a lot of films, but - even with no blood or gore, and little violence - this was so harrowing it was downright hard to watch at times. But in a way that never felt exploitive, but always in service of bigger themes and ideas. This is a film where knowing too much about the plot can work against the experience, but it's not giving away too much to say at the start we find a mother and child locked in a small room, having evidently been there for the boy's whole 5 years of life. They are scared, thin, holding on the best they can. We slowly come to understand the situation, at the same time getting a fascinating, and often chilling peek into what the world might seem like to a kid who has only lived in one small space. The film is beautifully shot: the ultra-tight closeups, and wide lenses feeding the dizzying and nerve wracking sense of being trapped, and giving the 'Room' (a character in itself) a plastic sense of shifting size and shape. The score occasionally seemed a bit much to me - there's plenty of emotion here without needing the music to convince us - but those moments were few, and certainly not enough to seriously hurt the film. It won't be everyone's cup of tea. It's dark, sad, complicated, scary and uncomfortable at times - although, as in life, lighter moments and hope find a way to break through. It's not light entertainment. But it's not like anything I've seen. It made me think, and has haunted me in the days since I've seen it. That's a lot for any film to accomplish.",9,1,3,2 June 2016
The Incredibles," Wonderful, fun, smart family entertainment
","While not quite up with the greatest of the Pixar films (Up, Wall-e, Nemo, etc.) This is still smart, inventive and tremendous fun, with some humanity thrown in to boot. For my money, more entertaining than any of the James Bond or superhero films of recent vintage which it spoofs (and with more exciting action besides!). In an alternate universe, Superheroes are told to stop being, well, super, because of the risk of law suits and other problems. But some just can't get the urge to fight crime out of their blood. Like Mr. Incredible. He loves being a family man (a family who also all have super powers) but a 9-5 job in an ugly, greedy corporate world is more than he can take. So he quietly slips back into the super-hero biz, and eventually drags the whole family in as well. All done with terrific animation, clever wordplay, great voice acting, and a nice comment or two about the traps of trying to be 'normal'. It gets all the balances right; humor to action to character to story.",9,0,0,24 July 2012
The Hurt Locker," Powerful, tense, beautifully made war film
","While set in Iraq, this is not a political film, it examines the psychology of men in danger, and how some men become addicted to it. Mostly critically lionized, but attacked by many, especially soldiers for being inaccurate. I didn't take the film that literally, or think of it as documentary realism, but more a stylized almost poetic look at the insanity of wars and those caught up in them, much like 'Full Metal Jacket'. This felt real on a meta level, not a literal one. There were a few logic lapses that bugged me, and the impact emotionally is (by choice I felt) muted. It's more a disturbing picture than a moving one. But it made me think and made my heart race, and images and moments have stayed with me for a long time.",9,0,2,22 July 2012
Pi," Challenging, creative super low budget indie
","I don't know if this is as good as my rating, but it's so odd, brave, idiosyncratic and haunting, that I want to forgive it it's flaws. Made on a shoestring, but using those limitation to create a unique look and style, this is a psychological thriller about paranoia and ideas, that puts you inside the lead character's head as he slowly cracks up, trying to figure out the mathematical basis of all life. He gets mixed up with Hassidic Jews who think he may have found the true name of god, and wall street traders who want his secret for riches. Full of surreal touches, it's not always clear what's real and what's in our lead character's head – but rather than being annoying, that only pulls you in deeper. To me it recalled great surreal earlier films like 'Eraserhead', and 'Seconds', but on speed.",9,0,1,23 April 2011
Garden State," Impressive first feature
","The first half hour of Zack Braff's debut as a writer and director establishes him as a filmmaker of immense talent, and I hope he'll get to make more films soon. It's opening act high captures a youthful sense of upper-middle class depression, alienation and ennui as well as I've seen, with comedy that makes you hurt inside, and inventive visual story telling. After that the film comes down to earth somewhat, but it's still full of goodies. Peter Saarsgaurd in particular creates an unforgettable supporting character while being complexly understated. This story of an depressed actor in his late 20s returning home after 9 years has a lovely mix of quirky humor, and well-earned sadness. Braff satirizes small town America without putting it down, and pokes fun at depression and family tragedy without it feeling shallow - neither very easy feats. Great use of music as well. Where the film falters for me is in the love story, which feels bizarrely familiar and unimaginative compared to the storytelling all around it. Also, while both fine actors, I never really felt any great chemistry between Braff and Natalie Portman. In some ways Braff's relationship with Saarsguard feels more nuanced. Last, Portman's character feels so young, so unformed next to Braff that it's hard to believe she's ready for a serious relationship. The very end has received some justifiable carping from critics as a bit of a cop out, but it didn't bother me nearly as much as such things usually do. But all that said, this is a terrific debut film, and a terrific film about being young and lost.",8,2,3,3 November 2013
Big Hero 6," Not a classic, but fun, funny, and sweet
","If not quite at the emotional or intelligence level of the very best animation, this is still fun and quite endearing. A young computer genius has his life turned upside down by a tragedy, but forges a bond with a goofy robotic blow-up nurse. This robot, Baymax, is designed only to help, not fight. But our hero equips him to be able to be a warrior machine to help take down a mysterious villain who has stolen our wunderkind's invention and is using it for nefarious purposes. The gap between the personality programming and body type of the puffy, gentle, cute robot nurse and it's re-purposing leads top most of the films biggest laughs. If the film has a weak spot it's that the bad-guy is not very interesting, and makes a lot of illogical choices that let our team of good guys (our computer nerd hero 'Hiro' has gathered a bunch of super-brainy grad students to be his back-up team) get away far too easily. The best cartoons almost always have a great villain. But it does have a world class sidekick in Baymax who was created walking a great line between anthropomorphic adorableness and staying somewhat honest to its imaginary actual programming, instead of suddenly becoming a sentient creature. Not a classic, but I'm glad I saw it.",8,6,16,7 January 2015
Brave," OK, so I'm a Pixar junkie.
","I'll admit 'Brave' doesn't have quite the wall to wall boldness, rule-breaking and sheer brilliance of the very best of Pixar's work, but I'll still take it over 95% of the Hollywood films I've seen this year. It never bored me, it made me smile a lot, laugh a little, and was a more touching look at the complexity of mother and daughter relationships than most grown-up films that try to deal with the subject. It also has a heroine who is a spunky, tough and first rate advocate for girl power, while still being heart-meltingly vulnerable at just the right moments. And it has tremendously talented voice actors in Billy Connolly, Kelly Maccdonald, and especially Emma Thompson. Most important, it has a twist half-way through that takes it in a delightfully unexpected direction. I will admit, for the first half I was a bit under-whelmed, The film seemed more Disney than Pixar, with 'safe' humor and ideas. Just a touch disappointingly predictable. But then a witch gets involved in this medieval Scottish tale, and with a twist that's more Shakespearian comedy than Disney, suddenly this is a new film we haven't seen before. The second half easily won me back over, and I was left feeling, as I always seemed to be, that working for Pixar must be about the greatest job in movies.",9,2,4,27 November 2012
Shrek 2," Doesn't quite match the original, but still very good
","A lot of fun, with good new characters voiced by John Cleese and Antonio Banderas. It just doesn't have quite the magic of the first film. But of course that's to be expected - part of what made the first so amazing was the wonderful world they created. Now that the world is familiar, it's hard to keep that same 'lightning in a bottle' enchantment. Still, way better than most sequels, and worth seeing if you enjoyed the original. On DVD - try to see the widescreen version. With animation this nice and detailed it's a shame to lose big chunks of the image.",8,0,1,14 May 2010
The Last Emperor," Like Bertolucci's '1900', a film full of great successes and some flaws.
","I can understand someone loving 'The Last Emperor' (as I do), or being bored stiff. Visually ravishing, it is an epic film about an empty man, the last emperor of China Pu Yi. Raised from birth with no real experience of the outside world, trained only to fulfill his role as a symbolic figurehead, we watch Pu Yi swept along by the great tides of history in the 20th century east. Only after going through ten years 're-education' at the hands of the Chinese communists does he start to seem connected to the world and to himself. The film forces a lot of challenging 're-thinking'. While clearly not forgiving the murderous excesses of the Chinese cultural revolution in the 60s, it does show that – at least in this specific case – the harshness of the Chinese communists was better for Pu Yi as a human being than the false kindness of all those that surrounded him for much of his life. There are weak spots. Peter O'Toole - who I usually love - is at his most self-consciously theatrical as Pu Yi's western tutor, a tone that makes it feel like he's in a different film. Some scenes feel like pure exposition, with characters having conversations only so we the audience understands historical context. And it's sometimes hard to stay fully connected to a 165 minute epic about an empty man (although 'Citizen Kane' could be looked at that way). But in the end, when Pu Yi finds some measure of happiness and wholeness as a simple gardener, there is a fascinating feeling of deep emotional reward for much of what felt flat earlier.The Italian TV cut is almost a full hour longer than the feature version (which Bertolucci is now said to prefer), I find each have different strengths. I agree that the longer version is a bit 'more boring' to quote the director himself, but it also fills out the story in important ways. By giving us more information about Pu Yi's childhood, and time in prison (even if some of those scenes do feel a bit clunky with exposition) his character feels much more fleshed out, less of a cipher. More a man, less a symbol. And some of the important changes both in the story and in his personality feel less sudden or confusing. Probably my personal 'perfect' version would split the difference, but I was very glad to see this alternate cut.",9,0,0,12 July 2012
Annie Hall," One of the great films. Timeless, hysterical, and universally human
","Just to add my voice to the choir: Quite simply one of the best films about romantic relationships ever made. Brilliantly written. Brilliantly acted -- Diane Keaton is tremendous, the supporting cast is full of gems and Allen himself takes the leap to present himself as a real (if funny) human being and not a walking joke. And brilliantly photographed by the great Gordon Willis of 'The Godfather' and many of most important films of the 70s and 80s. Wildly funny and ultimately heartbreaking. It's hard to imagine anyone who has ever been in love, or struggled through grown-up relationships NOT identifying with a lot of this film. I loved it in my late teens when it first came out, and I love it even more 32 years later. Every time I see it I notice different details, depending on my own current life experiences. A film of enormous wit, humor, invention, and understanding of the human heart. Its completely unique, playful and idiosyncratic in style and approach, but that experimentation somehow only makes it more accessible and universal. If you haven't seen it, you owe yourself a try, even if you're not a Woody Allen 'fan'. And if you saw it long ago, it may be time for another look.",10,0,0,18 June 2010
Green Street Hooligans," Worth seeing, but not without problems
","Interesting, well made, if flawed exploration of the British culture of gang warfare based around football (soccer in the US) teams. These aren't random crazies, but organized 'firms' as they call themselves that engage in frequent hand to hand combat for the sheer testosterone/adrenaline rush, and for the feeling of community, of belonging. It's a fascinating world and raises important question about the violence inherent in men.When nerdy Elijah Wood comes to England over to visit his sister after being expelled from Harvard, he quickly falls in with a gang, and much to his shock and ours finds that he is turned on by participating in the violence. The problems: first of all, it's hard to buy that Wood would survive long. Even with enthusiasm he's undersized and under muscled. His moments in the many (and well staged) fight scenes never feel as real as those around him.The Harvard set up that gets Wood to England feels clumsy, hard to believe and over-the- top. The third act has more than it's share of Hollywood-style plot turns for a film that sports a semi-documentary feel. Last, I have a question the film's point of view about the violence, which seems to be 'it's OK if it doesn't go too far'. As one character says about another's death, without irony. 'It taught me there's a time to stand your ground and a time to walk away.' But is it ever time to stand your ground to kick the crap out of others and have them kick the crap out of you over a football team?",7,1,1,3 December 2011
Frank," Odd, funny, sad and wonderful. Has stuck with me for days.
","An odd and wonderful mix of comedy and sadness, absurdity and reality, playfulness and originality. The acting is terrific throughout, the cast creating slightly larger than life comic characters that somehow still feel real enough to invest in emotionally. It's a tone few movies get right. 'Harold and Maude' comes to mind. Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) wants to be a pop star in the worst way (literally). He walks around writing amusingly bad pop tunes in his head. Life as a musician seems only a dream when as luck would have it a band, playing in his home town for just one night, needs a replacement when their keyboard player goes bonkers, and Jon is in the right place at the right moment. Thus begins Jon's journey with a band of misfits, who may be geniuses or just delusional... or both. They are led by Frank (Michael Fassbender) an amiable if deeply odd fellow, who wears a giant plaster head that he never takes off, even to sleep. His counterweight is the angry, punky and edgy Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who is fiercely protective of the fragile Frank, and sees Jon's attempts to get the band to go mainstream as dangerous to both their artistic integrity, and Frank's well being. All this leads to adventures, changes, discoveries and insights that are often outrageous and darkly funny, but ultimately quite moving as well. Also to be noted is just how great the music and songs created for the film are. They have to be 'off' enough to be funny, but good enough for us to believe there really is something to Frank's talents. This is done very well, both in the writing and performing, the actors showing some musical chops, and the film creating tunes that, to my surprise have been caught in my head for days. Indeed, the whole film has stuck with me far more deeply than I imagined while I was watching it. There's a haunting quality behind the humor that captures what special about 'outsider' art, and it gives the film a resonance and gravity to go along with it's light-handed playfulness.",10,12,20,2 November 2014
Super 8," Fun, if familiar
","Entertaining if derivative Steven Spielberg homage (ironically produced by Spielberg himself), this is smarter than most modern summer action movies by a long shot, with some amazing special effects, some fun shocks, and good performances from a brace of young actors. What it doesn't have is a lot of originality, being sort of a mash up of E.T. and Close Encounters with a few bits of The Goonies and old monster movies thrown in. It does remind us of how good those stories were, and that there's no reason you can't make a teenage friendly action adventure with smarts. It was fun and fast paced, but after the smashing (literally) opening I was hoping for more than a warm hearted, well made re-tread of films gone by.",7,2,3,4 December 2011
Life Is Beautiful," Flawed, but still moving
","This violently divided critics, some of whom saw it as a masterpiece of humanity, and others who saw it as trivializing the holocaust. I'm with those in the middle. There's a lot that's enjoyable and touching in the film, but also a certain amount that's too cute for the circumstances, or that screws up the story logic. I like the basic idea that Benigni tries to protect his child's innocence by convincing him that the concentration camp they're in is some kind of psychotic summer camp. And when the convention works it's very powerful. But when it gets hard to believe (as when the Nazi's fail to discover the boy over a long period of time) it takes a lot of the power out of it's punch. Still, some of the comic moments in the film's first half are gems, and while the dark 2nd half doesn't all work, it certainly gets points for trying. A film that's complex and confusing enough that I will re-see it.",7,0,0,19 January 2012
Rocky," Time has taken something from it
","Seeing this again for the first time since it was in theaters 35 years ago, I realized this is a very odd film. A strange blend of low budget 1970s street grittiness and realism, and low-brow Hollywood fantasy and cliché. I appreciate the bittersweet ending, much of the writing, and some of the acting (Burgess Meredith), as well as the very well done fight choreography. But other moments come off as amateurish improvisation, over the top performances, and old- fashioned hokum (e.g. Talia Shire's absurd physical transformation from over-the-top uber- nerdette, to sexy young love interest). Still, enjoyable and fun, if not quite the great film I remember it as.",7,2,3,27 July 2011
Don't Breathe," Well made, intense and effective, but missed the chance to go deeper
","Tense and effective thriller that, interestingly, has more of a horror movie feel, although there is nothing supernatural about the tale. In Detroit, a team of three young people burglarize rich people's houses, It's made possible by Alex, the brains, whose dad works for an alarm company, giving him access to keys and codes. Money is the muscle, a street guy who gets off on the rush of the whole thing as much as the pay-offs, and the girl at the center is Rocky, dreaming of a score big enough to escape from her trailer park existence (and crazy mother) with her toddler kid sister. The three hear about what should be an easy target. A blind gulf war veteran living alone in an abandoned part of town, who supposedly keeps a $300K cash settlement from his daughter's accidental death in his house. (Stephen Lang is very effective as the blind man). Of course, nothing IS easy, or there would be no film. The movie creates terrific suspense without having to rely to heavily on gore or easy 'cat-suddenly- jumping-out-of-closet' scares. This has echoes of John Carpenter's 'Assault on Precinct 13' and even 'Alien' in it's intelligent use of a strong, claustrophobic main location and interesting character details to produce it's fun-house ride. There are also a couple of very effective visual twists I don't remember seeing before. On the other hand, while it's a very impressive ride, it's also a limited one. The few deeper themes touched on tend to the broad and obvious. And the film doesn't linger on them much. Which is too bad, since the 'heroes' of the story are three punk kids robbing a blind veteran – who arguably has every right to defend himself. In turn, that would seem fertile territory to raise an interesting 'who's the real villain and why' examination that never comes. Indeed, the moral issues are aggressively avoided by the script turning characters far too neatly into monsters or 'good under it all' archetypes. A well made, effective enjoyable film, that had a shot of being something even more.",7,2,6,28 December 2016
Titanic," A triumph of Hollywood dazzle over an overblown, needlessly trumped up script.
","There are a ton of problems in 'Titanic' â€“ the cartoon villains, the stilted dialog, much of it obviously re-recorded in post production. Some weak supporting performances, the betrayal of a number of historical facts, and taking what was already one of the most dramatic nights of the 20th century and needlessly pumping it up with chases, gunfire, theft, scheming, etc. Yet a lot works. As much as I didn't want to give in, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio make a great, old fashioned, star crossed romantic couple. Many of the effects and stunts are amazing (although at other times you realize some wide shots are basically giant video-game like cartoons). And it made me cry -- while I felt like a fool for being swept up in it's shameless melodrama. I can't argue that 'Titanic' is art, or deep, or a great film, but I can say it's a terrifically effective entertainment that everyone should see at least once.",7,3,5,4 January 2015
The Fountain," A moving, creative, visually stunning, metaphysical look at love and life
","Leave it to me to love this often trashed film even more than Aronofsky's strong 'Requiem for a Dream' . (and a solid minority of critics went for it too). Just as experimental as 'Requiem' and 'Pi', but with a more complex, humanistic, metaphysical message. Here all Aronofsky's visual pyrotechnics (and the film does look amazing) feel like a means to an end not an end in themselves. A love story that takes place in 3 time frames (the 1500s as a conquistador hunts for the source of life, the 'fountain of youth', the present where the same man, now a scientist tries to find a cure for cancer before his beloved wife dies and 500 years in the future, where the same man again is with his love, who is now a tree, still looking for eternal life. (possible spoilers ahead)The fact that the past and future segments are part of a fairy tale book started by the dying woman and finished by the scientist seemed very obvious to me, but seemed to leave a shocking number of critics scratching their heads,confused as to which story is 'real'. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weitz are terrific, and I the score is creative and effective. Ultimately a very moving look at the nature of life and death. Yes there are a few pretentious moments, but I'll take slightly flawed grand ambitions to explore something in a new way over the same old same old every time.",10,3,6,25 April 2011
Zero Dark Thirty," Obviously this film divides viewers...
","...which, historically, a lot of the best films do.For me, this film has two unusual qualities; 1) Its greatest weakness is also its greatest strength. It takes pains to keep its distance,, to stay neutral and unemotional. It refuses to assign easy labels, to people or issues, even (as has been much discussed) being ambiguous about the use of torture. It gives very little back-story, even of the lead character. It doesn't work to win you to a point of view, to make you want to cheer your approval,or shake your head in shame, or even like or dislike the characters. For most of the film I found the effect (as one might expect) oddly alienating. I was gripped by the story, but I didn't feel emotions, or care about characters in the way a 'normal' film would have made me. And while watching the film this felt like a weakness. I felt distracted, disappointed, even bored at times, regardless of the dramatic nature of the story.Yet that same quality led me to feeling powerfully haunted by the film when it was over -- to ponder violence and its effects on human beings, the thin lines between perseverance and obsession, the inability to ever have a clear morality in time of war. It forced me to think, uncomfortably, messily about a lot of things, for myself.2) It's a film where, to a large degree the whole movie is redeemed by its final images,Spoiler in next sentences!In finally articulating the lost beyond words state of our lead character, suddenly all the emotion she never allowed herself and us is paid off in seeing that facade crack. End spoiler alertUltimately a very brave, and very un-Hollywood film in pace, style and content. This is war, and people in war stripped of easy answers. There are flaws (e.g. a lot of very pretty people who look more like actors than warriors), but these are minor compared to seeing an uncompromised and deeply challenging vision.",9,3,7,21 March 2013
There Will Be Blood," One of the best, most important films of recent years
","If the early Paul Thomas Anderson seemed to be channeling the young hyper-energetic Martin Scorsese, 'There Will Be Blood' - a more quiet and thoughtful, but no less amazing and cinematic work shows Anderson working in the vein of Stanley Kubrick. In place of a hyperactive camera, there is now a coldly, brilliantly observational one. In place of empathetic if damaged characters there are now people drowning in their own poison and lies.He has created a film both boldly theatrical and subtly real, both broadly political and intensely personal. Complicated and confusing emotionally and full of ideas and themes, this feels more mature and focused than Anderson's earlier work, brilliant as that all was. Daniel Day Lewis is amazing, the film looks incredible (if simply shot for an Anderson film), and I'm sure I'll only see more and more layers and meanings on repeated viewings. One of the more important films of recent years, this critique of the American dream of success, of conquest and of control is mesmerizing, and ultimately devastating.",10,3,5,10 November 2010
The Wrestler," I'm in the minority here...
","Rourke is indeed very good as a aging wrestler disintegrating before our eyes. And there are some beautifully shot sequences. But there's also a lot of hokum, especially in the failed relationship with his daughter, and the stripper played by Marisa Tomei, who is trapped in a similar downward spiral to Rourke, and may be his only hope, simply doesn't have the depth to balance him. For me, a good, solid movie, but not the masterpiece a lot of critics claimed, at least on first viewing. I'm a fan of Aronofsky's, but I found this the least compelling of his films.",7,0,0,26 April 2011
The Lion King," Beautiful, funny and moving, even for grown ups
","From an adult audience perspective: Highly entertaining, funny, and ultimately quite moving. It manages to be digestible for kids, but meaty enough for anyone older.Some great voicing -- especially by Jeremy Irons. The songs are good, and most of the animation is quite beautiful. It has its occasional sappy moments, and the basic plot is old as the hills, but its all done very, very well. Not as sophisticated as some of the Pixar films, but I not ashamed to admit it made me it made me laugh and cry - both times I've seen it. How many current Hollywood films, animated or not, can you say that about?",9,1,3,13 July 2010
Scream," For me an inventive mixed bag, but there's more good than not
","I've gone back and forth in my feelings about 'Scream' both times I've seen it, almost 20 years ago when it opened, and just now There are times when its meta-parody- but–still-scary approach to teen slasher films works quite well, especially the ending which manages to be funny, scary, over the top, and socially witty all at the same time. Other times it's too self conscious to actually be scary, but not surprising enough in its humor to really be as much fun as it could be. It's also a hard film to criticize, because the answer to almost every complaint (e.g. the actors playing high school kids all look like they're well into in their 20s) can always be 'but that's the whole point, it's always that way in these movies'. But one thing that does annoy me that isn't so easily shrugged off is that the cast seem to be in a number of different movies. Skeet Ulrich, for example, brings a surprising amount of realism and depth to his character, while Courtney Cox as an 'I'll do anything for a story' reporter plays a cartoon of a cartoon. This isn't of issue of 'good' versus 'bad' acting, but it does make figuring out just what the tone of the film is, more muddy than it needs to be. Probably the best thing about 'Scream' is it knows when to BE best. The opening and closing 15 minutes are the two strongest sections of the film, so if the middle is a little all over the place and sometimes repetitive, and a little more obvious in it's humor, that's not what you walk away remembering.",7,4,4,15 October 2014
The Iron Giant," It's a shame this enchanting animated film never found a bigger audience
","While the story is familiar (kid meets alien/ monster/ outsider, and befriends them, understanding they're not the threat the grown up world thinks), Brad Bird brings humor, freshness and heart to the sub-genre that lets this transcend into a terrific movie. Set in a cold-war paranoid America of 1957, the titular creature cash lands from outer- space, with a knock on his giant metal head leaving him with amnesia about his purpose or history. After being saved by a 9 year old boy, a series of at first comic, then later more serious adventures begin. There's some very funny jabs at the cold war mentality, and some terrific, unusual supporting characters, including a mom more interesting and complex than you find in most cartoons, and a local wanna-be beatnik artist who joins in to take the giant iron man's cause. I love the look they designed for the Iron Giant himself, there's something wonderfully retro and almost art deco about him, and they do a great job of bringing heart and emotion to this gigantic metal creature. By the end I was shocked at how moved I found myself. A lovely, well told, fun fairy tale that is as much for adults as for kids.",9,0,1,11 March 2012
Shrek," A wonderfully original animated film for adults as well as kids
","Utterly original, wonderful animated film, with great voice performances by Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy, written with lots of adult wit and humor. Amazing, hip use of music (including John Cale's version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah'- how's that for obscure?). You don't have to be a kid to love it, or have kids to rent or buy it. Charming, sweet, funny and romantic. On DVD, try and get the (now inexplicably out-of-print) widescreen version, so you don't lose chunks of the lovely visuals on the sides of the frame.",10,0,1,12 May 2010
Trainspotting," Brilliant, and I find new details on every viewing
","Wildly inventive, extremely funny (often sickly, disturbingly so), filmed with an insane sense of energy and pace, and an eye for truly inventive surreal images, and a soundtrack full of great songs that all fit perfectly. Not to mention a bevy of superb, brave performances. This study of 4 young mates in Scotland, 3 drug addicts, and one addicted to violence reminds me in some ways of Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Boogie Nights'. Both take us behind the scenes of dark, dysfunctional works (drugs, porn), but do so with a sense of humor and humanity that transcends clichés and makes us relate to these characters as human beings, not just porn stars or drug addicts. These are both films full of ideas about choices and morality, without ever feeling moralistic or judgmental, and both use their central world as metaphors for the bigger worlds around them. You might escape porn, or drugs, but you can't escape the forces that push people into them,(spoiler ahead!) Indeed I'm surprised to read so many reviews claiming Trainspotting's ending is optimistic. Yes Renton is walking away from drugs, but he's also stabbing his mates in the back, and joining a world that's just as obsessive about money, success, drink, sex, material things, as an addict is about drugs. To me, that's what the whole, chillingly ironic 'choose life' monologue that bookends the film is all about. Really 'choosing life' is about a lot more than just saying 'no' to drugs. Not to mention the title 'Trainspotting' which refers to the innocent, but still obsessive, humanity-disconnected hobby of noting down types and times of trains that go by. Perhaps a slower death than drugs, but a turning away from living life just the same.",10,5,7,25 August 2013
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Sweet, romantic, terrifically acted if flawed film
","For me this was not a one of Allen's great films, but was an entertaining, diverting one, with two terrific performances by Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, a very good one by Rebecca Hall, and a decent one by Scarlett Johanssen. But Johanssen's character comes off as very shallow, so the complexity of her relationships with Bardem and Cruz never seem more than adolescent. I realize that's ultimately part of the point of the film, but here it's way too obvious from minute one, and keeps the film from feeling deeper and more complex. None-the-less, a romantic bittersweet film I've enjoyed well enough to go back and re-watch.",7,1,3,10 July 2010
Sweet and Lowdown," A wonderful, funny and moving character study
","Sweet, gentle, sad, with amazing performances by Sean Penn and Samantha Morton. Interestingly, this got mixed reviews on release for being 'small' in scope, but to me that's its great strength. As screwed up as the Sean Penn character is, we still get pulled into him, and it makes for a lovely portrait of a sad, lost, brilliant jazz guitarist. Penn and Allen conspire to create one of the most simultaneously infuriating and oddly ingratiating characters of recent memoryNo big conclusions or statements, just a subtle, brilliantly acted comic and tragic study of humanity. That's enough make this the strongest Woody Allen film for a number of years.",9,1,1,6 July 2010
Fantastic Mr. Fox," I liked it the first time, loved it the second
","Utterly odd and unique in the best way. Sweet, funny, breezy stop motion animation film based on the Roald Dahl novel. It's always delightful, and very well voice-acted by the likes of George Clooney, Meryl Streep and Michael Gambon. A fox/father decides to settle down, stop stealing chickens and become a respectable newspaperman, but hitting a mid life crisis the part of him that longs to steal birds can't be denied one last big heist, which leads to ever more dire (and funnier) consequences. I liked the film on first viewing, but found I loved it on the second. First, for film fans, or fans of Anderson's work, it's hysterical how he has translated his personal style, both visual and character, to animation. This looks and feels like his other films in a way that is by itself an absolute crack-up. But more important it turns out that Anderson and Dahl are a great mix, with Dahl's great imagination taking Anderson's cock-eyed view of life, and expanding it to a broader canvas. In the end, while populated by puppet animals, this is as human, touching and funny as almost anything Anderson has done. It may be too sophisticated for little kids, but any child advanced enough to enjoy Dahl's books (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, etc.) should have a grand old time, along with their parents.",9,0,1,19 November 2010
Moonrise Kingdom," A wonderful, romantic, and uniquely odd Wes Anderson film
","With Wes Anderson, you either buy into his odd, very idiosyncratic and distinctive style, with it's touches of twisted, surreal fairy-tale tone, and performances that are both restrained on yet not at all naturalistic – or you don't. For me, I find his style almost always endearing, and both very funny and very touching (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou was the one time it didn't work for me). As always the performances here are remarkable from Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray (the quintessential Wes Anderson actor), Francis McDormand and Tilda Swinton as the adults, to two luminous and unique performances by the film's pre-adolescent lovers Kara Haywood and Jared Gilman. While imposing a seemingly astringent style, all right angles (almost every cut within a scene is at 90 degrees or 180 degrees to the shot before it), and carefully composed tableaux, this film captures the wonderful, surreal weirdness of first love (or at least one's childhood fantasy of first love) with a moving and hilarious honesty. Somehow, while the story of Sam and Suzy's attempt to escape from the insane adult world that surrounds them has little to do with the realities of day to day life as we know it, it has everything to do with the realities of the budding heart. I can't remember when a film so reminded me of my own first fantasies of love and (tasteful but honest) sexuality. I love when a film makes a tear fall from my eye at the same time I'm laughing, and that's the rare trick Anderson has accomplished here.",10,1,2,16 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," For me, by far the best Star Wars' since 'The Empire Strikes Back'
","Excellent, and a lot of fun, even if it occasionally crosses that thin line between reboot and re-hash. But if a Star Wars movie is going to be in many ways a re-do of an earlier episode, than thankfully, it's a re-visiting of the very first and still best episode 'A New Hope', And thankfully J.J. Abrams is directing, since he seems to be able to channel the beloved film- makers of his youth (Spielberg in 'Super 8', Lucas here) and actually make this feel more like loving homage than creepy imitation most of the time.Abrams also does a good job at keeping three meta levels going at one – the revisiting of the playful high energy fun that started the whole series off, keeping alive too the echo to those even earlier serials of the 1930s and 40s that inspired the very first film, and still creating a modern 2016 film while trading on our nostalgia for both the first 'Star Wars' and how much younger we and the world seemed when we all first encountered it. All three levels dace together neatly under Abrams hand.The new main characters are well drawn and well acted. Diversity and sexual equality has finally come to the galaxy, and it's none too soon, with a spiky, feisty female lead, and a black leading young man to fight with and woo her. But what makes these characters much better than average for this kind of film (and even for the Star Wars series) is they have a little complexity – the heroes have moments of cowardice and other less than admirable sides, and the new villain has moments of humor and humanity. Casting actors for ability to seem human helps too. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Adam Driver all manage to get in some real moments amidst the explosions and chases. (Admittedly Driver looks nothing like his on screen parents, but who really cares) And Andy Serkis creates a nicely chilling evil demi- God as the baddest of the baddies.I also appreciate that Abrams has updated the effects – but only a little. It still looks, feels and sounds like a sibling to the original, not an effort to erase our memories of, say, what that jump to light speed is like. And speaking of memories, it's hard not to get a bit lump in the throat-ish when you first see Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill, all showing the years in a way that very, very few sequels have ever been able to do so honestly. Ford especially seems to be having a blast, and brings us along with him.Perhaps not quite a great film, but – for me – by far the best Star Wars' since 'The Empire Strikes Back' oh so long ago.",8,3,28,3 June 2016
Tarzan," Sweet, funny, touching animated fun
","While not up to the level of sophistication of the best Pixar films, or even the very best of Disney, this has an admirable sense of humor, and an ability to be quite touching at times (if occasionally sappy). It also has some surprisingly dark and violent moments that might put it off limits to younger kids, who in other ways are its perfect audience. This takes the basic Tarzan story and focuses mainly on Tarzan's need and ability to be accepted by the Gorilla clan he is adopted into, offering slightly obvious but always valuable lessons in accepting those who look or act different. It also has a spunky and even sexy Jane – an explorer who comes to Africa with her scientist father, and (of course) an evil guide looking to capture and enslave the apes. Jane's romance with Tarzan is funny, playful and sometimes moving. The animation is generally energetic, kinetic and fun, and I found myself nicely caught up in the story. Unlike some animated features, I actually wasn't sure exactly how things would work themselves out. I also appreciated that Phil Collins' songs, which tended to hit the nail a little too hard on the head, were few and far between. If they weren't great, they didn't really damage the film either. It sounds like I'm damning this with faint praise, but the bottom line is I had a good time. I smiled, I chuckled, and I got choked up. When ANY film – animated or not - can do all three for me, I consider that a solid victory.",8,3,3,13 October 2014
