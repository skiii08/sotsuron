The Ring," Horror movie?
",I don't know how others can say that this is a scary movie. I wasn't scared one bit. I was expecting this to be a quite a scary movie because the creator of the original Ring(ringu) did a good job in his Dark Water but I have yet to see the Ring and Ring 2. But I can say that this Hollywood remake really sucked!!!!! And this movie is damn boring!!,Null,0,0,24 December 2002
