The Equalizer," A Wesley Snipes movie
","This is a Wesley Snipes movie in which they inexplicably managed to hire Denzell to play Snipe's role. Really, it's a 'B' movie. The story is not just dumb, it is painfully dumb. In fairness the actors do a good job considering the dreck they had to work with. Marton Csokas and Chloe Moretz especially do nice work. Denzell, who is now on the wrong side of sixty, is miscast in the Perfect Killing Machine role. But the actors cannot redeem this movie from it's preposterous story line.How this managed a 7.2 on IMDb is mind-blowing. I guess there's a lot of people out there who'd watch a film of Denzell reading names from the phone book and call it art.",4,2,3,13 September 2015
Fury," Dumb and ugly.
","This movie was painfully bad. As I say, it is both dumb and ugly. The dumb parts at least provide some (unintentional) chuckles. In the absurd climatic battle sequence the action starts in broad daylight, there's lots of shooting, and next thing you know there a battle raging (between one broken down American tank and a battalion of Waffen SS) at nighttime. The Germans are, naturally, atrociously bad shots. Although the historical reality is that the sky over Germany in April 1945 was swarming with Allied fighters and fighter-bombers to the point that German troops could hardly move except at nighttime, in this flick the Germans move around unhindered.You're wondering about the plot? Don't look for anything resembling a plot, because there is none.As for the 'ugly' part, I'm going to be very charitable and assume the people who made this piece of garbage did not INTEND to make the Nazis seem like the good guys and the US Army look like a bunch of deranged psychopaths. That's what they did do however. We get to see the Americans murdering prisoners and raping women - and its not even presented in a negative light, you almost get the impression we're supposed to approve of these war crimes. The only act of mercy which makes an appearance is when an SS man spots the lone survivor of our tank crew in hiding - and decides to pretend not to see him.For some reason the first review which everyone sees when they come here to look up this movie is one of the very few to give it a high rating, even though that review itself has been given a very poor rating. What's up with that, IMDb?",2,8,17,1 August 2015
