The Incredible Hulk," Great interpretation of the Hulk!
","The new Hulk film was well made for a number of reasons. Without giving any major plot details, their were some really good reasons to see this movie.The movie was packed with action, had a believable romantic element to the film, although the plot was slightly rushed in the opening credits the remainder of the movie did a good job clearing up lingering questions, and of course spotting other famous comic book/ex-comic book stars is always fun.Overall, Ed Norton, Liv Tyler, and Tim Roth are believable in their respective roles and the energy throughout the film keeps you wanting to watch more. I definitely would recommend this movie along with Iron Man if you like to watch exciting action packed comic book movies!",8,3,5,15 June 2008
