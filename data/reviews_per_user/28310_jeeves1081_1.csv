Hereditary," Ending made ZERO sense
","100% agree with reviewers who felt disappointed by the ending of the film. It was not only disappointing, but at the end I just sat there, agape, trying to figure out what just happened. Not factually, just ... philosophically.
This movie had SO much going for it and was on all the right paths to be a unique thriller. At the end you really feel as if they told the cast: 'we're out of film and money. Do some improv and wrap this up.' 
Not using more of Milly Shapiro and the mom was a HUGE mistake and the biggest disappointment. I thought that's where it was going and----wow. Nope and nope.There is really no other way to put it except it was a good movie for 90 minutes and then it turned into three schlockey, disjointed ones.",Null,1,4,25 June 2018
