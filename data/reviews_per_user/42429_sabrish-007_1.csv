Skyfall," Horribly Disappointed. Skyfall???? I call it Skyfail.
","Lets start from the beginning. Pre credits scene is shot in turkey. Bond is chasing a guy who has stolen a drive containing information about undercover agents.OK, not bad. Yes, its full of action but end result, bond gets shot and falls into some river. Credits time, adele's song.... Not sexy, but fits the movie perfectly. The animation is Bad. Next, bond is alive....How? The movie doesn't say how!!! Oh god, kill me!! Bond enjoys death, meanwhile MI6 is under attack, cyber terrorists, we are led believe, caused the attack. This, is when it starts to become very boring. Cyber terrorism? Very common if you ask me, this is nothing special or extra ordinary. You've seen it before.. Die hard 4.0 for example. I suggest you watch that if you ask me to choose between skyfall and die hard 4. OK fine, cyber terrorism accepted, At least show us how destructive it can be how its going to be a big threat . But no, nothing of that sort is shown. Next, there is absolutely no motive for the villain. He harvests computers in his hideout, for what? Just so that he can keep a track on MI6. Yes, its a horrible plot. The first time i said 'Woah!' in the movie was during the house siege. That was really cool no doubt. It was impressive. The climax wasn't that bad as well. Performances- Craig was good. Judi Dench and Barden did justice too. Bottom line is that a weak plot and MORE IMPORTANTLY, very few action sequences spoil Skyfall or is it Skfail?!",6,10,22,8 November 2012
