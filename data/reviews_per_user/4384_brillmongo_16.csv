Captain Phillips," Back to film school with you, Greengrass
","I understand it may be his 'thing' as a director to film every single shot in a hand-held fashion but it makes Captain Phillips an incredibly unpleasant and frustrating thing to watch.There is simply no excuse not to use a tripod, none at all. It is pathetic how this pointless and infantile fad spreads to other films too.Don't waste your time or money on this garbage. There are far more sensible things you could be seeing.Sorry Greengrass, but it seems you've still got a lot to learn about the fundamentals of filmmaking, the use of a tripod being your biggest oversight.",1,22,51,30 January 2014
John Wick," Pretty lights, poor show
","Very minor spoilers aheadIt's for the most part nicely shot and nicely lit. Keanu Reeves, despite hamming it up with an unnecessarily raspy voice in every scene, is also capable as the lead and there are several strong supporting characters that provide for some depth in an otherwise simplistic and shallow plot.There ends all the good I have to say on the subject of John Wick.Strangely enough one of the primary failures of John Wick is the sound design, it's not as godawful as Chappie with its belt fed rifles but there is a terrible discordancy here between what we're shown and what we hear. The soundtrack in particular sticks out like a sore thumb whenever Wick's 'man with a purpose' leitmotif lights up. There's something to be said of the missed opportunity of including somber jazz or grunge and instead going with generic and grating hard rock in a movie which is otherwise more tonally similar to noir than typical action fare.The plot's pacing and direction is where the film really begins to lose me however and it becomes clear rather quick that little forethought or planning was put into the script. Wick is described as a loser for example by a man who spent the preceding night trashing his very un-loser-like home and stealing a car that he admired so much he would rather keep than sell to his fence. Not enough time is spent on the titular character himself either to establish him in any way, instead what we get is a couple lines spoken about him in hushed reverence from another character - who neither he has been properly introduced at that point. And from that point on the rest of the movie is singularly focused on the revenge plot and while it plays out in a number of visually interesting settings the fight choreography, visual effects and inconsistent behaviour of Wick as well as the extremely long scenes make for a complete doozy. Instead of allowing for a gradual buildup of tension followed by brief bursts of violence our Hero dispatches enemies with such ease and in such great numbers that it's hard not to think you're watching Max Payne: The Movie. I'm reminded of a quote regarding droids in the Star Wars prequels, if our heroes are able to deal with these enemies with such ease and in such great numbers that their presence is entirely inconsequential, why even include them?Finally there's the issue of our Russian crime boss being played by someone with a very obvious Swedish accent. I don't hold anything against Michael Nyquist but he's a poor fit for 'menacing bad guy' and even if he were able to speak English without his accent there's precious little he could do with the pathetic dialogue afforded his character. Attempting to pass of a Swedish man as a Russian mobster so jarred me out of the movie I ended up simply fast-forwarding past any scene where he made an appearance, which of course meant John Wick took a nosedive towards the end.It might be interesting to consider for a moment what could've been done with the basic themes and characters here if the project was in the hands of a competent director, editor, makeup team and effects artists but it'd be a lot simpler to simply say - don't bother.",3,1,5,16 June 2015
Gravity," Neat visuals, no more
","This film was a pretty big disappointment, I had only a vague idea of how it would play out in terms of plot but was expecting it to be a competent sci-fi film. It was not.Gravity carries with it a pretense of realism but throws it out the window in the first couple minutes. Why the film even bothers in taking the time to point out that space is indeed silent is beyond me since there's always some sound playing. It's as if it's afraid to let go and take the viewer seriously, a streak that runs throughout the film.Above all else I get the sense that Cuaròn wanted to make a film that was essentially CAST AWAY IN SPACE WITH SPACE EXPLOSIONS AND CATASTRPHIC RE-ENTRY and for what it's worth all those elements are here and executed effectively. But none of the things any sensible person would expect to see here are present. Why is it for example that the only communication Bullock manages to establish with the surface is with an amateur radio operator? Does Cuarón really believe that NASA relies entirely on satellites to stay in touch with astronauts? Does he really think they would be unable to use ground based means in case of an emergency that renders ALL of their conventional channels inoperable?The above is however a minor gripe and the same goes for all other ignorance regarding orbital mechanics. What really irks me about this film is the infantile dialogue.At no point watching this film was I ever convinced the people on screen were astronauts, and that is the paramount failure of Gravity.",3,1,4,1 February 2014
World War Z," A waste of time and money, don't bother
","While World War Z may not be as offensively bad as certain other films released this year it is still insultingly stupid to anyone with even the most basic measure of common sense or logic to their name and by lazily handwaving the only element that may have given it some lasting appeal with hamfisted mother nature metaphors it ends up being a completely forgettable experience.I could go on to great lengths about all the little details that ruin this film but for something so unengaging it just can't find the motivation. There's no characterisation, the film wavers on tone and themes all the time, things happen for no good reason other than to move the action to another location, there's bad cgi, bad audio, excessive use of shaky cam to hide the bad cgi, professionals routinely act like amateurs, more bad cgi, more shaky cam and a tame and predictable ending.",1,0,5,13 September 2013
Pacific Rim," Overall a pleasant experience, but deeply flawed.
","Giant robots engaging in fisticuffs with giant monsters is a joy to behold that I doubt will ever grow old, but the other elements in Pacific Rim are greatly lacking.It goes without saying that the basic premise is pants on head retarded, I just wish basic things such as characterisation was handled more effectively. It doesn't help either when Pacific Rim contradicts itself by one moment speaking of the need for efficiency over showing off and in the next scene (literally) pulling its punches.Bad writing is an forever will be bad writing, and Pacific Rim is rife with it. It's a fun ride though if you are willing to overlook such faults and the momentarily atrocious CGI.",4,2,6,2 October 2013
Oblivion," Glossy packaging, but it's all dumb inside
","The setup is simple enough, bad dudes blew up the moon and so we nuked them all. The loss of the moon's stabilising effect on the earth combined with all the nuclear fallout meant humanity sought refuge elsewhere. But we're still using the earth to suck up all the deuterium from the seas for fusion energy and to protect these installations we got a bunch of heavily armed autonomous drones that kill any 'scavs' they find.It all looks sorta pretty but the problems in this film quickly build up and compound on each other to the point where very quickly not a goddamn thing makes any sense.Apparently 64 years from now humanity has access to fusion energy so I suppose getting the last few survivors to Titan isn't too big of a problem but mining Saturn's hydrogen atmosphere for deuterium is out of the question? And we totally can't deal with the radiation but our main character who works on the surface and gets dust blown into his face doesn't need ANY form of protection other than the clothes he wears? Also earthquakes were too much of a bother but a -180°c mean temperature is not?Oh and the high risk job of drone maintenance that requires our hero mechanic to be armed with not just a side-arm but an honest to goodness assault rifle, that can totally be done by just one guy, right? Better not give him a couple mates that can at least keep a look out so his bike doesn't get stolen, that'd be boring.Did I mention by the way that our protagonist has a bobble head doll that's got sentimental value to him? No? Well now I have and I'm happy I shared that with you because little details like that are very important to bring to your attention because otherwise how else would you understand Tom Cruise is a human who likes motorcycles and football and has height issues?This film is just plain badly written. The way it glosses over everything substantive and wastes an inordinate amount of time on heavy handed characterisation is very reminiscent of bottom rung comic books.Avoid",1,10,19,26 July 2013
Man of Steel," Very little good, very much bad
","Well, it's got a nice soundtrack at least. But the audio editing is done very poorly.The CGI for the most part isn't offensively bad either, but I'm not a twelve year old any more and it's not for the CGI I watch films.No, I watch films because I hope for an engaging experience where for a moment I'll forget I'm just watching a contrived spectacle and allow it to take me for a ride. But that's all Man of Steel ever is, a contrived spectacle.This is one of those strange films where almost every scene feels really drawn out and at the same time laughably rushed. The introductory sequence we see at the beginning could have set the stage for a compelling battle of ideologies, or given us some food for thought about our own consumption of natural resources and the value of space exploration. Instead it does neither, giving us only a single trite bit of dialogue to inform us Krypton is coming to an end and that everyone's going down with the ship.Rushed too, are the the scenes that introduce to us Clark Kent the character. There's not much for me to say here other than they don't make a lick of sense in the context the film constructs for us.Then we get to the introduction of the Lois Lane character who for whatever reason is in the thick of the action from there on out, just more contrivances layered upon a very shaky plot. I completely zoned out and stopped caring altogether when Clark cauterises a wound with his eye lasers, that garbage scene was on par with the c-section from twilight.Isn't it odd how a film that continually stresses the importance of a search for how and why through its cinematic language actively discourages the audience from considering these things?",1,3,8,18 October 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A cartoonish, overwrought mess of a film
","Before getting into the meat and bones of what I have to say about The Hobbit part 2 I'd like to point out that I'd be giving the film a 3/10 and be happy to leave it at that if it weren't for the extremely inappropriate use of 3D. It added no depth to any scene that could not have been accomplished with proper lighting and cinematography, it only served to distract and obfuscate as soon as anything moved across the screen. This pointless gimmick only ruins the experience.Now onto the actual film, saying it's no good is putting it lightly. The screenplay is an incoherent garbled mess that makes a mockery of the source work. Scene after scene we get to see characters we love and hold dear behaving inconsistently, hamming it up with lines that make you shake your head and wonder whoever thought it was a good idea to introduce a triangle drama for no discernible reason, among many major complaints. It's downright disrespectful how badly written this tripe is.And of course there's a whole bunch of completely unnecessary and needlessly drawn out action sequences shoehorned into the movie for no other purpose than filler. Legolas' nonsense athletic feats challenge the suspension of disbelief so frequently and so egregiously that eventually you just throw up your arms in the air and give up.What purpose is there to an action scene where you don't care for any of the characters? What tension is there when the bad guys are so ridiculously outmatched?All this added action just ends up ruining the pacing because now you've got too many subplots going than you can reasonably allot time for.Even the audio is noticeably bad. The music from the LotR films will stay with me forever, the music playing over the end credits here just made me leave the theatre in haste.Well, at least Smaug was great, and we get a noticeably improved Bilbo this time around.",1,57,103,15 December 2013
Room," Well that was a waste of time
","Typically you expect dramatic productions to have some sort of resolution, a satisfying denouement or if nothing else at least some intriguing moments with characters, dialogue and scenery that capture the imagination.Room offers none of that, relying wholly on two main conceits to carry the entire weight of the story. Beyond the first act this film is interminably dull and by the end of it I found myself thinking 'what the f**k was that it'.While it avoids being offensively bad, Room is still not an enjoyable watch. Best avoided.",3,12,30,1 June 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Death of a franchise?
","Pointless and overlong, a disjointed mess of a film.I don't really know what direction Disney are going to take with Star Wars in the future and frankly I don't care any longer. I am wholly indifferent and have no intention to see any more of these garbage films in a theater.
None of the major loose ends from The Force Awakens are resolved in The Last Jedi, we don't get to find out who Rey's parents are/were, what lead to the first order becoming a force in the galaxy, who Snoke is and what his origins or motivations were. The only mystery that is unraveled is Luke's voluntary seclusion - which of course is deeply unsatisfying since it's contradictory to what we know of the character from previous films.To say that the plot of TLJ is simplistic would be putting it mildly, none of the villains are in any way convincing as their only motivations are being evil and none of the supposed heroes are in any way compelling either since they all act like disorganized morons and apparently the only way to make a buck in this universe is by selling arms, either to fuel or fight an insurgency no more than a few hundred men strong.What are 'the resistance' resisting against? The first order are evil yes we fully understand that any organization that keeps building planet killing weapons to cause wanton destruction is evil, but evil TO WHAT END? Having Leia fly through space like superman, Luke dying from going out of mana, the slow-mo chase through space, all the inappropriate and misplaced humor - these are all profoundly idiotic plot decisions but what really bums me out about this film is I have no reason to care about any of the characters in it.",1,3,4,20 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Predictably awful
","Mindless entertainment usually has some charm to it if nothing else, Guardians delivers none of that. Throughout the whole film it provided maybe two sincerely funny moments while the rest of it came across mostly as unintentional comedy thanks to a gibberish script. I've never laughed at someone dying of cancer before but the prologue of Guardians is just so hilariously god-awful it had me in stitches all through the opening credits.Oh Christ, what a forgettable, uninteresting and pitifully bland mess of a film this was. I suppose it appeals to easily impressionable simpletons but I struggle to see how, there's hardly any character development, the plot is nonsense from start to finish, the antagonist is some bland and boring caricature who seemingly only exists as a vehicle to introduce Thanos (who is a big deal I'm assuming?) and it's all just so damn predictable. Perhaps worst of all the ending is just another anticlimactic retread of the old and tired 'power of love' trope.I may have given Guardians at least one point if it had decent effects and camera work put into it, but none of that is to be found here.",1,33,67,25 November 2014
Elysium," A monumental failure of filmmaking
","Nevermind the stupid premise, nevermind the rushed and paper thin plot, nevermind the numerous and constant missed opportunities at being clever with the script, nevermind the nauseating use of hand held shots, the flaws of Elysium are so fundamental and appear so often it's damn near a wonder why it was made in the first place.The lapses in common sense and logic in this film compound on each other so fast it's hard for me to even keep up with my notes and it goes way beyond just being haphazard writing or questionable directorial decisions, the mistakes present in this film are of the kind that would make you fail film school.",1,42,72,26 November 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Big budget done mostly right
","There's a scene in Edge of Tomorrow where people in a pub are talking about the possible motivations of the antagonist alien species might be, Tom Cruise responds to this by saying 'what difference does it make?'. This is obviously meant to be interepreted as a matter of factly statement about the business of fighting for your survival but I can't help but feel it's also a line put in there by the screenwriters addressed to the audience in which they're trying to tell you not to worry about the nitty gritty of plot details in a movie featuring time travel as its premise.And of course, getting past the fact that time travel as a plot device doesn't hold up to any form of reasoned scrutiny it has to be said that what Edge of Tomorrow manages to do with this conceit is really enjoyable to behold. Bar a couple really tired clichés, the basic elements of plot progression and character interaction come together really nicely here. Pretty much my only major complaints about this film are the generic and utterly uninteresting enemies, a retread of the tired old mothership ending that grants our heroes an automatic victory upon its destruction, sorely lacking audio production and a miscast Brendan Gleeson who's completely out of place as a stern faced general (I have never seen him pull off a stern face).It's fantastic too that practical effects are used to such a great degree and when CGI appears it rarely stands out.",7,4,7,11 September 2014
The Water Diviner," Chroma noise in a major motion picture production IS THIS A JOKE?
","How the everliving hell does a production fail so spectacularly that members of the film crew cranked the ISO up on their cameras to the point where every shot they took is ruined by massive amounts of noise and no one at any stage notices?This is beyond pathetic, such a failure of basic technical ability deserves ridicule if found in youtube videos but that Russel Crowe would be guilty of such an amateurish pratfall in his dramatic directorial debut is woeful and shocking.This is a crime so basic and unforgivable that as soon as it became clear it wasn't just an isolated mistake but a recurring nuisance I immediately ejected the disc and threw it in the trash WHERE IT BELONGS.",1,19,50,9 April 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Unbelievably stupid in almost every sense
","I have nothing good to say about this film, nothing at all. Catching Fire is a film made by an incompetent director based on a garbage script featuring soulless performances and edited in the most hamfisted way possible.It only exists to appeal to the easily impressionable who mistake poorly implemented themes of violence and romance for depth and to vacuum as much money as possible from the YA audience.The Hunger Games series is an entirely cynical enterprise with not one redeeming value, do not encourage such practices by paying money to see this film.",1,20,36,3 February 2014
Hacksaw Ridge," Dots connected competently
","Don't kid yourself, Hacksaw Ridge is nothing more than a paint-by- numbers Hollywood war drama — complete with wholly unnecessary romantic subplot and flashbacks to childhood traumas. There is nothing courageous about making a film like this, it's as safe a bet on box office success that a studio exec could ever make.But it's well made damnit and having a competent director at the helm working with a script that never strays too far from what is at its core a simple story about a man's convictions and the ordeals he goes through really is a treat to behold.My only major complaint is that none of the actors at any point reloads their firearm. Vince Vaughn is also out of place as a drill sergeant and his lines early on often feel as if they'd be more at home in one of the myriad comedies for which he is better known. I suspect his role in this film has more to do with the personal politics of the major players involved than it does his established body of work.",7,2,9,14 November 2016
