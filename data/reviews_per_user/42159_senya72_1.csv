Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," sometimes funny
","sometimes funny but mostly outright awful. it was hard to see the whole movie without throwing up.the scenes with excrements in the napkin being brought into living room where local pastor and his wife discussed in life in America - brr. the fighting between two guys one of them fat and the fat's guys butt into Borat face magnified on the big screen - brr. by the way i think i was the oldest guy in the cinema - most patrons were teenagers and high school kids. other scenes were funny with horse dragging the car through mud, chicken running in metro, abduction attempt. the escape from the inn don't get esp Borat speaking Hebrew most of the time with his Kasakh friend.",1,18,38,5 November 2006
