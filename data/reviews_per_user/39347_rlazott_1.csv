Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Best
","If you haven't heard of this movie then your from another planet, that's all I can say. This is by far the best cinematic masterpiece ever created and a exquisite pleasure to watch over and over again. Harrison Ford is just incredible in his role as Indiana Jones and I can not think of one single movie that is more appealing and has a broader range of enjoyment per demographic than this one. Hmm, apparently there is a 10 line minimum so I have to go on and on some more about this incredible film. The locations and scenery are fantastic, the action is intense and in your face and the characters are refreshing and memorable. Not to mention the humor, there are plenty of comedic scenes within the movie as well to keep you laughing.",10,0,0,15 June 2004
