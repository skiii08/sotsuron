Insidious: Chapter 2," 6 ?
","First of all, I did not know there was chapter two to the Insidious! But as the director is the one of SAW movies, it does make sense and I believe more chapters are in years to come.I believe the chapter 2 is better than the first one but only to the middle of the film. For me - at least - the part when story gets 'into the head of Josh' or becomes supernatural, that is when I lose interest in film and thought it was not believable anymore. I know it is a movie and it is a horror and those things do not exist, but just making them look less possible was a turn off for the movie.Especially the ghost hunter lady seemed totally out of place and too 'real' for someone dead. Darkness and mist did not work for me to make 'a scary in the head images' All in all, give it 6! Though I was hesitant between 5 and 6 but it is a bit better than to be in the middle.",6,0,0,18 February 2015
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Quite Good
","I am still smiling ... This is a light, fun film. A comedy, I guess with elements of a musical - though I remember only three or four songs: Finally by CeCe Peniston, I will survive by Gloria Gaynor and Save the best for last by Vanessa Williams. PENISton and GAYNor must have been chosen on purpose.Guy Pierce is really great. I saw him last in the movie Momento ...and here, he is so believable! You can not believe this guy is really straight.I actually expected a film with Patrick Swaysie and Wesley Snipes, but it must be some other film about drag queens... Anyway, a really fun and relaxing film. Eight from me.",8,0,1,6 June 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," Hmmm...
","First of all, I must say that I was expecting 'something different' considering the 7.3 note here! Something really worth of that note, but this is not that great!As many have pointed out, this film has a problem with ending. I would have ended the film when she sees the birds flying. But that alien / mars attacks ending was just totally out of the blue. Totally not connecting with the film ( though I admit it proves the story that something bad had happened). I mean... even if they really wanted the alien ending, it could have been more subtle. This was like you added a totally different movie to the one you are doing.Good point is that you really DO NOT know if the guy who held the girl in the basement is good or bad. We do not know if he killed anyone before he took the life of the guy in the basement. Everything is up to you to decide. All in all, he is actually a good guy from what we were seeing up to the point when he shot the guy ( but only when he said he would take his gun).All in all, this maybe could have a better note if it wasn't for such laughable ending. I did not like it.5 from me.",5,73,100,5 October 2016
The Finest Hours," Not bad
","This film starts kinda slow and unrelated to the story ( you expect to see) and it is rather slow paced at the beginning, but soon it gets more packed with action and rests until the end.I enjoyed the film. It was even touching at the end. The fact that it is based on the true story does give it a plus. The breaking of a ship ( two, in fact) in haft because of the storm was really wow! I really got into the scene when they showed the first breaking of the ship. It was intense and really well done. I guess I liked those scenes which were filmed inside of the ship and all the hard work being done to prevent the sinking of it that caught my attention the most and the ones I really enjoyed. However, the relations between the sailors ( in the ship and at the land were somewhat superficially done and yes, you get that some of them are not liking each other, but, why is that is not rally explained and I though it should have been)The love story that also goes parallel to the disaster at sea is sometimes sweet but most of the time is kinda blah and maybe it should have been cut in entirety from the film. It does add something to the film, but not that much in reality. But I guess it is important as it is one of the true facts.All in all, not bad. I give it a rating eight!",8,22,32,20 May 2016
The Ring," Quite good!
","Me and my friend were talking about horror movies and he suggested this one and it was quite good!The story itself - I guess - is similar to many of other horror stories and movies. I actually thought that the end of the movie was when she 'rescued' the girl from the well and you see the reporter with her love interest sitting on some old bench. OK, so she did a good thing - 'heard' the little 'evil' girl and now that the wrongdoing is kinda redeemed, everything can be as before. I was wrong! That is the beginning of the twists that happen in the last 6, 7 minutes of the movie and last two minutes being the ultimate twist!I liked that the movie was entertaining from the beginning to the end. I did not expect the ending to be what it was! Actually, at one point I thought that the little evil girl is now grown up ( not dead or in the mental institution) and that it is the girl who moved to the apartment of the reporters ex love interest ... I did expect however the drawings of the kid to be explained. Especially the last ones he was drawing on the floor - the big black hole. But it was not. There were too many drawings circulating in the movie with not really clear connections or purpose - at least, I believe. So, I do wonder what they all mean and above all why the faces of the girls / people were blackened / distorted. I mean, OK, you can say it is the evil presence / force, but ... I saw that there is the part two, so will probably see it tonight. I know the sequels are almost never as good as original movies, but... Will give it a try.Eight for this one!",8,2,2,11 March 2016
Hereditary," Great one!
","I do not remember when was the last time I watched a good horror film! And this one is not good but great!Surprisingly, it last 2 hours but not a moment is boring... it has that sinister atmosphere, music and acting are great... I just kinda did not completely understand the ending - I have my views, but not sure if they are correct.All in all, 10 from me.",10,0,3,27 October 2019
John Wick," Quite good!
","Now, this is an action film ! From the beginning ( well, not actually first 10 minutes or so, but....) to the end is full of action, interesting plots and scenes and really keeps you entertained!I must say that I have not seen in a long time a better action movie! Keanu is perfect in the role! All other actors are too. The story is great. The moving of the film/plot is done perfectly. All those secret society mafia agents living by the rule are great! There is really nothing that you can say is bad about the movie.The language they use...I thought it was Romanian almost entire film. But when they mentioned the Russian church, I figured out it must be Russian.Loved the ending of the film. Most of the films have some kind of a bad ending and that can ruin all, but this one is perfect!My favorite part/scene: when those 'cleaners' come to his house after the first shooting and wrap those dead bodies like mummies ! Man, that was something!Nine from me. Don't know exactly why it is not ten, but 9.50 would be more exact.",9,0,2,1 April 2016
Gravity," Hmmm...
","Like many films I want to watch, I do read reviews here and positives ones plus the average score made me think it is a good one. Well, it was not!I can not say it is totally awful but it is pretty much close to it. Besides the fact that nothing happens and that I was waiting whole time something to happen - nothing is the right word to describe this film. I do not like Sandra very much but in comedies she is totally fine. But add her to a boring film... the result is zero interest for me.I guess some beautiful scenes of the universe is what saved this one not to get one from me.You lose nothing if you skip it.",2,5,10,18 February 2015
Memento," Quite Good
","Well, I spent the last hour searching the internet and reading questions and answers about the film here on the site.I saw the movie yesterday evening and still can not figure out what actually happened and I wonder if what I believe happened is actually true.So, yes, I guess like the others said and wrote, this movie is good that it makes you think or makes you identify with the leading role. But seeing that so many people are not sure what to believe, kinda makes you feel that the movie has served is purpose as a talking point!For me, actually, the most confusing part is the role of Natalie in the film. 3 different scenes show her in 3 different lights - which one is correct or all 3 are made up?!And the beginning of the film... I thought at first it is kinda boring that they repeat the same scenes (with just a minute of longer action than the previous scene) several times with only a bit of a change...but then, at the end, I realized that the beginning of the film is the most important ( or so I seem to think)All in all, good film! I was hesitant between 7 or 8, but I go with 7. It may be the good thing that we are in the dark just like the main character of the movie, but somehow I did not like that much. I like all things to be clear to me. But again, it is really good movie!",7,1,2,15 March 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Not sure
","It was entertaining. I liked the mixture of French, German and English. The whole film is kind of a fantasy.
The end - I guess he wanted to tell us that in any war, America can do the most horrible things and get away with it (which is true I guess).
More music would have been good.",7,0,1,7 February 2020
The Notebook," Hmmm...
","OK, this film is romantic, it has a beautiful story and cute and appealing actors, but ... all that did not really convince me to share the opinion of many here to give higher note.Early on in the film you understand who is the elderly couple and the man who reads from the notebook. The story is beautiful and I guess this is the kind of love we all wish to happen in our lives, but aside from that wish ( which may affect our rating) I don't see this film as anything more moving or extraordinary than hundreds of others...I admit that the era of 30's and 40's is really done good. James Marchal was good in his role as well as Ryan and the main girl, but, although everything is pretty much OK, the film did not move me in any particular way - and some films do move me or make me cry.Six from me. It is not bad, but is is far from great. Somewhere in the middle.",6,2,2,27 June 2015
The Mummy," Quite good!
","Oh, I am some 17 years late on viewing this film but even after all this time I can say that the film does not look dated. It is very entertaining. The story is simple and follows chronologically the chase for the lost city / artifacts. As for the special effects... again, though the film is old I do not think that the effects seem dated as many people complain about in some older films in comparison with new ones and more advanced technology. However, some effects did remind me of the film Terminator and some scenes of Michael Jackson's Thriller video.As a lover of Egypt - especially ancient Egypt and as I returned from there a month ago - I enjoyed the film very much. I guess if you could look at all the things that are 'egyptian' with inscriptions and statues and figures... it may not be very accurate, but if you just look for entertainment - this film is great! Not boring and fast paced!I don't know where it was filmed, but I thing some scenes are shot in Morocco. Maybe I am wrong.Quite good, all in all. Eight from me!",8,3,4,13 March 2016
Orphan," Quite Good
","I am giving this film a nine just because it is kinda not believable that the woman in the end in the house with all bad that happens is not taking a knife or a gun or something to fight or to protect herself. That really kinda ruined my vision of otherwise really really good movie! But I would not call it horror. Besides the opening scene, nothing is scary - even that one is not...just bit too bloody!Must say that the twist with Russian 'hospital' and the discovery of who is the patient is really great! All in all, very exciting movie... keeps you guessing... makes you feel involved... great acting from the 'orphan'",9,0,0,26 February 2015
Spotlight," Quite good!
","Initially I rated this film with a ten. But after several days I lower it to nine.The film is good, no doubt. But maybe it is not really all about film that is good and great but rather the story itself which is intriguing and controversial especially given the fact that it is based on the true events.I must say that the very ending with the names of places around the world where those crimes took place was what left the biggest 'wow' impact on me. Because you see that this is something really huge and you realize how big and powerful must Vatican be to cover all this up and keep it under rug swept.The actors were all great - both journalists and the victims. And although no scenes of actual crimes were shown, you can imagine the painful experiences. It is a sign that the film was done in a great manner ( for me) but still... just a bit away from the best rating.",9,0,0,17 September 2016
Dear John," Ok film
","It was on TV so I gave it a go as the main 2 roles are some beautiful people. Haha - not a very interesting reason to watch, but...Overall, the film is ok. Of course, C T will be shirtless in a film - surfing is a good excuse for walking around shirtless - I do not complain - just saying.
He could have been better as a fisherman or smth at sea than military guy. She was just good in her role - those eyes kinda make her believable.I loved 'the twist' with a letter with which the film starts. I thought it was a mistake as I was thinking it was for the girl, but I was wrong...All in all, ok film for an evening entertainment.",7,0,0,7 July 2018
Interstellar," Hmmm...
","I did read many reviews here before seen the film and from them and the average stars I thought it was going to be really good, but it was not. Though the story of the film is quite good and acting too, and plus I like those kind of movies, it just was kinda boring most of the time for me. I couldn't even watch it as a whole but I had to pause it because I was bored and then continued only because I do not like to do anything in half.Surely, it is better than Gravity in my opinion which is totally totally boring, since they are kinda similar. I was hesitant between 5 and 6, but 5 is more accurate for me. It is neither good neither bad - just boring.",5,8,13,18 February 2015
Man of Steel," Not bad
","I saw this movie on a long seven hour flight from Beijing to Doha. What I needed was to pass the time and to be entertained. This movie does that! It is entertaining, interesting and holds your attention.Henry C for the role of Superman is a great choice. He is damn hot in the movie. Shirtless or fully dressed. As for Amy A - this is the first movie that I have seen of hers. And she was good. I was kinda surprised to see Kevin C in a movie ( don't know why). And especially his role of Superman's father. What I did not like was his overprotective/moral role to the young Superman - it is kinda clichÃ© and useless in my opinion. Young Supermen were good too.All in all, not a bad movie if you seek only something to entertain you. My rating is eight!",8,4,6,9 August 2016
The Revenant," Quite good!
","Oh,man... If Leonardo does not get his Oscar for this finally, I think that those people sitting there are insane!The film as a whole is good. Although it is some two and a half hours, it is not boring, but it is not really exciting either. What kept me watching it was beautiful scenery and really beautiful shots! In the beginning of the film, I had an impression that the film was shot like panoramic photography...wide angle to really capture the beauty of the scenery. And the scenery is great. I believe the film was shot in Canada... Not sure.The scene with a grizli bear...Man oh man...Was that the real bear? Whatever it is - it was impressive! As well as the dead horse scene when he sleeps inside. Brutal, powerful and at the same time beautiful! And I must say that there were so many powerful, brutal and beautiful scenes as it is the movie.My rating takes mostly into consideration how beautifully shot the film was, how good Leonardo - first of all - was and Tom too. As I said, the story and 'entertainment' were not really to my liking.Worth the watch! Hoping Leonardo to get that statue!",8,8,21,27 December 2015
The Shining," Not bad
","I like to watch horror movies, and this one is said to be the classic... so I gave it a go last night and I must say that is not bad. I believe I remember when I was a kid that we had this movie on the VHS or somewhere... I remember the twin girls and the lift and that blood pouring into the hall but that's it. After 25 years, these scenes do not seem to trigger any horror. In fact, the twin girls seem kinda out of place - and they seem very old?! Are they even girls? I believe that the roles of all 3 main characters were played out very well, though the woman seem - at some scenes - uncertain ( to me) as if she does not know if she played right or not. Also, I found it a bit silly that when she is chased, from all the places she could go ( including the outside which I am sure is the best solution) she goes into her room ( where, normally, she would be caught!) and locked herself with a child in the bathroom. OK, I know that add to the suspention and all, but those unprobable 'moves' kinda turn me off.All in all, not scared. Maybe in the 80's it was... I give it a rating of 7.",7,1,3,10 March 2016
The Intouchables," Not bad
","So, I will go with the flow of the others and say that this is really a wonderful and touching movie. I guess it just adds to it that it is based on the true story. However, I will not agree that this is the best French movie as it is certainly not! Le fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain is the top French movie (for me)! I think that the movie has to thank its high score to the brilliant and utterly convincing acting of Omar. His acting and presence really are believable and you feel connection to him and to the millionaire through him. Of course, the story itself has the universal appeal of compassion, understanding, struggle and faith.I liked the part that touches on art. 40.000 euros for a painting with a red dot on canvas?! And Berlin gallery new artist painting ... clever!Yes, this is a clever movie. No wonder it gets high scores. Although it is set in Paris, somehow I think it would have been better if there were more scenes with the city itself. Nine from me!",9,0,0,26 September 2015
The Exorcist," Hmmm...
","I guess it is never too late to watch a classic, in any genre. This horror film looks kinda funny now. And now, after seeing this one, I can understand all those parodies with vomiting, 'fuck me' sentences and head turning...More than two hours is kinda too much for this movie. I guess that first 45 minutes or so, nothing happens and that the story and the introduction to the characters is a bit unnecessary. I think I wanted 2 or 3 times to stop watching it because I was kinda bored.The thing with the old coin from Northern Iraq is not quite explained. It is obvious that it has something to do with the devil but ...that's all you get.Also, the ending with that coin / bracelet which the mother gives to the priest, who returns it, is kinda ...what? Does that mean that he will be possessed? I know that some films are made for us to give our own interpretations ... but in this case - if they wanted that - it is not really successful.Six from me.",6,1,2,21 August 2015
The Fault in Our Stars," Quite Good
","There are always some small things that ruin my opinion of a film which could have been perfect and would get a ten from me. This movie is really great - has a great story, the acting is very well done and believable (something I always search for in a movie, even if it is a sci-fi), the scenes of Amsterdam are beautiful... but... although in a film he has one leg, it was kinda obvious in most of the scenes that his legs are just fine ... also, the scene in a car after the funeral is a bit unrealistic to me and the way she treats the writer ... of all places in Amsterdam - Anna Frank house and kiss with an applause ???!!! A bit cheesy ... but all in all, has some really great lines which do stick in your thoughts.Certainly, do watch it!",9,1,2,27 February 2015
Bridesmaids," Perfect
","I really enjoyed it from the start to finish. It was entertaining and funny. I do not find many comedies funny these days... like not funny at all but this one was!
Plus music is great! Fiona Apple, Britney Spears and Wilson Phillips with Hold on! The fact they are in the film was wow!10 from me.",10,1,1,11 January 2020
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Quite Good
","I decided to watch the film since many of my friends were really into this film.And what a joy it is ! I don't know for the others, but almost the whole film I had a smile on my face. It is strange that a film can make me smile or maybe to say make me happy while watching it! But this one did this!The story is weird but beautiful, as it is the hotel and everything around it. It is very 'arty' film for me and I liked it because of that! The acting of everyone was really great! I think the choice for two main roles was superb!10 from me!",10,0,1,20 February 2015
It Follows," Hmmm...
","Reviews here are pretty confusing as whether this is a great or flop film. I actually read - before watching it - some praise for the film and that was why I picked it up to watch, but I must say that I did not enjoy film very much and do not agree with those 10 stars ratings.First of all, for me, this is not a horror film. There is nothing, but really nothing horror there. A few jump scares are attributed to a ball crushing into the window and similar things.Second - it ! It follows... we do not know what is IT actually but since it is transmitted by sex - I thought that this is kinda metaphor for AIDS/HIV or any sexually transmitted ds. But what about getting rid of it by another sex intercourse? Hmmm, so can not be that I guess. It remains mystery what is it actually but looks like humans or zombies.The film is rather interesting in its mystery of it. A sequel is for sure planned as there are many unanswered questions. Mine is: why that girl let herself be killed at the beach? And why she was killed like that? I actually think her body resembles some of Picasso's sculptures ( on the beach).Also, it seems that IT is following the girl and the boy or only one of them at the end... Whom exactly? Interesting story - for sure. It is entertaining. But can not say it is interesting and entertaining the whole time. Some parts are just slow and boring and unnecessary. Rating six from me, though maybe five would be also true.",6,1,2,9 September 2016
Beasts of No Nation," Not bad
","I just finished watching the movie and ... Well, I am torn what to say exactly.The theme of the movie : war - is done really realistically. And although it is not said where it is going on, you can say that all that is happening can and is happening everywhere where war is going on.The movie is seen through the eyes of the young boy who is 10 or something and that gives the movie its powerful note and powerful message which is anti-war ( I guess) .There is a scene where children fighters after the battle are playing hide and seek in the fields. I think that that scene portraits the most powerful message of the movie: these are children who should be playing these kinds of games every day of their childhood, yet, they are killing people and fight and do drugs and all horrible things that war brings with it.Maybe I am not really a fan of war movies and there were parts / moments that I found the movie a bit boring... but, all in all, not a bad one.I was hesitant between six and seven, but giving a seven rating as the acting of everyone war really really great! From the main cast to those who are just 'passing' through the movie.",7,2,5,1 December 2015
Gone Girl," Quite Good
","I really liked the movie!It is one of the few movies from 2014 I have seen and that caught my attention during the entire running time! The story is very clever and the ending is really surprising - I mean that he stays with her in the end after all.Ben is really good and believable in this movie. I do not like him very much - think his acting is kinda boring - but here, quite the opposite. The leading lady - can't remember her name right now - Pike is great too. Although the running time of the movie is quite long, I think it does not have boring parts or scenes that are too long that make you lose interest.Nine from me.",9,0,3,20 February 2015
Get Out," Quite good! Modern Twilight Zone episode/film
","I wanted to see a horror film and I picked up this one. Though it is not horror in my opinion, I am not disappointed, on the contrary, this was really interesting film. I can not really comment on all racial things concerning this film as I come from place where there are no such differences in race but I do understand what the film wanted to say in that matter.The whole film from the moment the couple enters the house feels like a modern episode of Twilight Zone. The atmosphere, the fake/forces smiles of the maid, the unusual behaviour of the gardener, the hypnosis scenes...Must say that the main couple did a great job! They were really convincing in their roles. Parents a bit less or maybe it is just the way their roles were supposed to. Brother was crazily spooky during the dinner and after...The time of my life song was lol while she was picking up the next victim.All in all, this is really an entertaining film. Full of surprises, twists are unexpected. You feel all along that something is not right, but you can never guess really what is going on.Nine from me.",9,10,19,1 May 2017
Call Me by Your Name," Summertime Sadness a la Lana Del Rey
","This movie is perfect!But what else could make it even more perfect or better to say even more beautiful would be a song by Lana Del Rey. Her voice and tone would fit so greatly into this film, though the soundtrack is really nice. The music matches the slow page of Italian summer...These two had the chemistry that it is just unbelievable. The one playing Elio - chapeau! It was so conveincing, so natural. Parents were also very good.The opening credits with antique photos do set the artistic mood of the film, because this is a piece of art!Pure 10!I heard there may be a 2nd part. I think that is a mistake. No 2nd part can come close to this perfection!",10,1,5,4 February 2018
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Great one
","From a distance of a week pass, I must say that this film or cartoon or whatever is really great!I liked the mood of it. It is dark, it is gray, it is kinda spooky and kinda Frankenstein meets some Disney cartoon. It is especially notable in the two main figures in it. And the figures of them and everyone else in the film is just awesomely done! Hands down, it is perfect.I may not be sure if it is appropriate for the kids and if they would understand it, but for adults it may be a bit 'too childish' if you only expect some scare or to be more 'mature' ( though I guess the main theme of love is mature in itself).The only thing that I did not quite like ( though it is not that I disliked it completely) is the singing / musical part. I know it would be hard to express those emotions and thoughts otherwise, but... Nevertheless, it is great, so nine from me.",9,1,1,17 September 2016
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Hmmm...
","I finished reading all three books yesterday. Actually I read 1800 pages ( 3 times around 600 pages) in less than a week. The book is GREAT! But, maybe the fact that I wanted to see the movie right away spoiled my enjoyment!But I can say that the movie did follow all the most important things from the book and that the story is as it is in the book.Of course, I can say that the book is 100 better than the film, but it is always like that with movie adaptations.I do not think that the role of Michael Blumkvist was chosen right. I completely imagines him in a different way. Lisbeth role is quite good and the girl is good in her role.This movie gets seven from me. But if you read reviews here before watching a movie, do read the book first!",7,0,0,20 July 2015
Sinister," One of the best movies I've seen!
","One of the best movies I've seen! Of any genre! I do like horror movies and must say that not so many horror ones did scare me...but this one did! I really liked all about the movie. The acting was good from Ithan to the kids. The cinematography is excellent. The story is quite interesting although there are so many films about houses and ghosts or evil spirits and similar living with families. In fact, as I am writing this, I believe I should see it one more time. I do recommend to all horror fans! I do believe you will not be disappointed as many times - at least for me - horror movies are not scary at all! 10 stars from me!And I do not give 10 so easily",10,0,1,18 February 2015
Woman in Gold," 10
","Now...this is how you make the film about art, stolen paintings and Nazi looting. Not those Monuments Men movie which was totally awful and completely not artistic!I am a lover of art and Klimt and this painting - Woman in Gold is one of the reproductions in my room. I was familiar with the thing behind the painting but not entirely and I think that this movie does it a real justice!Helen is brilliant in her role. The girl who plays Adele is really similar to painting portrait.The movie was done in a really good pace. Slowly explaining the story, and mixing past and present. I wish more movies like this one were done or will be done!9 from me.Highly recommend to all art lovers.",9,0,1,24 June 2015
Pretty Woman," Good one
","I am some 30 years late into this film, but it was on TV yesterday and I decided to watch it. I enjoyed it very much. I can not say if the story is one way or the other (as some reviews commented on) - I can only say that for me the film was entertiening and that is what I look for in a film.I was curious to see where in the film is that Roxette song - It must have been love - I thought it is at the end, but it fits the scene in the car.My only complain is the end. A bit je sais pas...Nevertheless, my rating is 9 as it was a real joy to watch it.",9,0,1,19 June 2018
The Shape of Water," Not bad
","I decided to watch it after the Oscar nominations are revealed and this film leads with the number of nominations - 14 I think, if I remember correctly.So, you would expect a lot from the film with that many nominations and ... the film is not bad, but it is not mind blowing either. It has an interesting story and it has a very interesting end. Though her marks on the neck gave away - for me - right away what is going to happen.I like the artsy side of it. The creature is ...well...somewhere in between. I like the atmosphere of the apartment of the cleaner girl. The other cleaner lady was great too. in her role, but mute girl was really into the role.Music was interesting and I liked the whole 50's vibe.I have seen better films nominated for Oscars this year and I have to say this is not among my favorites. But it is good.Seven from me.",7,18,32,2 March 2018
The Witch," Quite good!
","Well, this is something! It is - as it is labeled - a horror film but also a mystery film. I would add that this is kinda a fairy tale. Are witches in fairy tales?Or only the good princesses and nice things?!Anyway, the film is quite good. I really liked the performances of all characters in the movie. Really convincing and utterly believable! The oldest boy was phenomenal! The oldest girl too, but really, every role was perfectly acted! I really had a feeling I was in the 15th or 16th century. The mood and the tone of the film totally transports you to those dark ages of new puritan America and those religious fanatics... We have the devil in the movie, but I must say that the figure of father was reminiscent of Jesus ( on purpose or not - and maybe it is only my thought - did not read other reviews yet). The film is disturbing at times. The witch is ... well, I am not sure if there is only one witch or there are many in the film ( not counting the last scene) who were after the family.The sounds ( I would not really call it music) was totally dramatic! It fits the mood / color of the film. The last witch dance and those sounds were ... chilly!!! All in all, this is really a great film. Fairy tale horror I would say. Definitely would recommend to anyone!",8,1,7,16 April 2016
Rosemary's Baby," Hmmm...
","OK, so... this is ( supposed to be) a horror movie !? A very good one since the rating is eight?! Either I am missing something or ... For me, personally, there is not a single thing that is horror about this movie. Horror of knowing that you watched a movie for two hours and twenty minutes for nothing - that is a scary thought, horror worthy. Nothing else! I am not sure what type of a movie is this. It can be a drama. Thriller is not. Even though there is a premise that the baby is devil, this can not be called a sci - fi or supernatural movie... I don't know. It is just a very confusing one with all the strange for nothing scenes/dreams. Aside the fact that it is not a horror ( which I expected and why I gave it a try) it is not entirely bad. I can appreciate the acting of the main woman character. It was kinda a bit interesting to see the fashion of the 60's ... But, no positive points aside from that. Maybe it is just that I am not a fan of old(er) movies...Though, I do know to appreciate a good one when I see, no matter when it was filmed ( I believe).This one is not really interesting ( though it is not completely boring). For the first 45 minutes or more, nothing happens. Other hour and a half, things are rather ... hmmm ... silly!? Don't know... I would definitely not recommend this movie to others. Four from me.",4,4,6,26 March 2016
Pitch Perfect 2," Hmmm...
","I watched the original one two days ago, and this one yesterday. And it is clear to me that - as many other follow-ups - this one is not as good. From the moment the 'jury' laughs at them about no having chance at world competition, you know that they will win! How predictable!I did not get what was the point of Beca's internship and all those scenes about it - she can make a record - OK, and the producers are vain and steal others ideas?! Snoop Dogg in the film was a weird touch, and Christmas album!?It is to repetitive of the first movie. Maybe if I saw the movies with 2 years gap, it would be OK, but one after another - totally copy / paste.1st one got 7, this one 6.",6,1,4,19 June 2015
The Reader," Good one
","Really good film ... great acting and brilliant story. Although the film is rather long it did not have a single minut that is not captivating. Seems like 2 stories or part I and part II but it is really blended very well.I guess the acting really carries the film as all actors are really great.I would recommend this film. Almost 10 from me, but I go with 9.4 as rating.",9,1,1,8 December 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Not bad
","I am a fan of Agatha's novels so I was aware of the story and the 'murderer'. I also remember that I did watch some many years ago another version of this film...can not remember exactly if H Poirot was the same as in the series - but now I can say that the older Poirot is much better - or maybe I am just used to him.As for the film - it is good and entertaining - light entertainment to pass a pleasant evening. All those famous names seem on paper: Wow but in the film they do not bring much (which is expected with their names). But it was nice to see Michelle P and P Cruz.A little minus would go that although the train is stopped in Yugoslavia, you can not even for a moment hear Serbian language (which I kinda expected to hear from the workers in the background).All in all, 7 + from me.",7,0,3,23 November 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," Rating is correct
","Before watching any movie, I do read reviews here and this is correct one as far as stars go. It is really engaging in a sense that although it is long, does not bore you. It is emotional and you are bound to shed a few tears. I don't know many movies with two main actors, but their roles here are very truthful to what may be real persons experiences. I loved the movie also because it does give you hope that injustices done by others to you will be - one day or eventually - 'paid' in a way or that something good is waiting for you after the hard times. Anyway, a story you can not simply not love. I may see it 20 years later, but it is universal movie. Go and see it",9,0,0,18 February 2015
Parasite," Interesting
","I watched this film last night, just before the night when it woukd win 3 oscars. I can understand why it did win, though personally I can not say that I was blown away by it.
Certainly it is entertaining and very very symbolic.
At times I thought that they were inspired by Emir Kusturica's film Underground.8 from me",8,7,12,10 February 2020
Centurion," Not bad
","I have just finished the reading of the book from which the film ' The Eagle ' was filmed, so while I was in the Roman period, I wanted to watch a film with story from that period. And this one is about that and it was not bad.The story is interesting, but, somehow, although not boring and slow, it did not fully grab my attention. There was something missing ... Maybe a subplot ( to explain a bit more about the 'captivated woman' or how the centurion became one or how did it end so far from Rome or something ...) to give more layers to the film.The scenes of the battles were good. Even the chase was interesting in a way. The end was too predictable ( that he would return to the 'witch woman' from the woods. Though I did not guess correctly the moment he'd return. By the way, that 'witch woman' was too clean and too not from that period / or for the role she was playing. Somehow she did not fit into her role at all. Centurion was good, but, also, somehow he lacked something ...There is a soundtrack ...but somehow I did not really 'heard' music.Six from me. It is interesting and entertaining if you like the Roman period and bloody battles.",6,0,2,22 March 2016
The Conjuring," Quite Good
","The poster for the movie made me instantly think Sinister - the best horror movie I've seen. And hanging scenes with a tree do look similar. Then there is a haunted house with a family and children - another similarity. But on the other hand, almost all horror movies are around haunted houses and families in them. And children are always a plus to add to horror!I think the acting is really good. Maybe one of the reasons I liked the movie. But it is not quite scary to me. As I said, Sinister was the one that really scared me and I expected the same from this movie, but it failed to do so.I was hesitant between 7 or 8 but will go with eight as it is quite good horror movie.",9,0,0,18 February 2015
The Woman in Black," 8
","I am a fan of horror movies...this may be the one, but it also says it is a drama, and I can see why this is the case. However, there are some scenes which were really scary and made me feel uncomfortable which many many horror movies did not do. I really like the scenography. The house which is the center point of the evil and the place of woman in black is really beautifully decorated inside with all the gargoyles and sculptures ... the violet walls and all the paintings are just beautiful.Music ( if it is music) with only drums while he is entering the room of the woman in black is really really scary in a way that make you feel like your heart is starting to get the same rhythm.I kinda did not like the end, but I did like the fact that they did not please the woman in black and that they were wrong in assumption how to stop the death of children...8 from me.",8,1,4,22 April 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not bad
","I watched this one also on a long flight of seven hours. So, although sometimes long movies can be a bore, I was thankful that this one was well into two hours and something.The film is entertaining. That is what I asked for and what I got. It made me sit through it for two and something hours and I was not bored and kept my attention.Henry C as a Superman here was a bit less convincing than in Man of Steel film - for me. Amy A was the same as if it was the same movie ( and that surprised me that she was neither better nor worse than in previous one). Ben A as Batman ... do not what to say. He kinda did not fit ( in my mind) into that role. But, can not say he was bad. He was OK. The rivalry between them was kinda artificial for me. I did not get it actually. I was even more puzzled by the 'warrior woman' or whoever she was - maybe coz I am not familiar with the films where she is a 'star'.The soil did move on Superman's grave ...so, there will be 3rd part. As with this one, I will not probably watch it at home - maybe on some other flight - I hope it will be entertaining.Seven from me. Man of Steel did get eight.",7,2,3,9 August 2016
Amélie," Perfect
","Is there anything about this movie that can get a note less than the highest!? So, naturally, this gets 10 from me!I like the story. I guess anyone who is romantic and who believes in eternal love or love at first sight or soulmates or similar love affairs things will give this movie a 10!Audrey is brilliant in the role. She is so convincing that no wonder she will always be remembered and known as Amelie. All other actors are great too and the mini society we get to know from the caffe and the building is appealing.Paris scenes... Who can not fall in love with the city of lights? Who can not wish to go there once or return? And who can not wish for a love like that to happen in Paris? Renoir painting... I think that Renoir was chosen very carefully because I do not think that there is a painter ( was) who was as 'sweet' in his themes as Renoir. So, it is natural that such a painter fits perfectly into the sweet film.Soundtrack ... It is one of the best soundtracks I know when it comes to mostly music only arrangements. And the title music/song has become somewhat of a signature song for France and French culture.So... Great love in a great city. Beautiful music that adds to beautiful scenes. Perfect movie is here.",10,1,3,26 September 2015
The Purge," Quite Good
","As Sinister is one of the best movies I have seen, when I saw that it is the same director and that stars Ethan - I said hell yes and I was not disappointed!On the contrary, I thought that the film is really on the edge, keeping you on the edge in a good and terrifying manner. I guess or I read somewhere that some civil unrest of African Americans in LA or somewhere were inspiration for the movie and after the latest unrests in the USA with killing of Afro Americans...you can not help but wonder whether the movie is a kind of a prophesy of what awaits the society in a near future.Eight from me, though maybe it deserves more.",8,0,1,19 February 2015
Pitch Perfect," Hmmm...
","Actually, I did not know what kind of a movie this is... I knew Anna's name from the Billboard charts but nothing else. I was kinda surprised that it is a teenage comedy with elements of musical comedy.What I liked about the movie is that it has a good mix of songs used - both sung by various groups who compete and as a background music. The blond Fat Amy was very cute in the film. The main girl - Beca was too reminiscent ( name and appearance) of Bella from the Twilight saga. Her love interest is kinda too similar to American Pie boy. I don't know if it just for me similar or it was intentional.All in all, the film is OK. Kinda funny, not boring. Good to pass the evening while there is storm outside.So, there is the follow-up... I guess it is not too much different than the original one.",7,0,2,17 June 2015
The Cabin in the Woods," Quite Good
","I love horror movies, but this is not a horror movie for me. More of a sci-fi or even mystery or something. What I wanna say is that I was not scared at all! But I did enjoy most of the film.What I did not like was the end with all those monsters... They kinda looked fairytale to me - though not all of them!I really liked the idea of the film, especially reality show thing. And I must say that at first, or better say first few minutes I was puzzled whether I was really starting to watch the beginning of the film or it was something else totally random!All in all, quite good. Not scary but not boring either. It does grab your attention, so from me - 8 !",8,0,4,18 February 2015
The Nice Guys," Hmmm...
","I am not sure into which category to put this movie. I am aware that they were trying hard for the film to be funny but for me it was only on several occasions. Thriller elements were kinda good but far from real action/thriller movies. As for the drama elements - it can be discussed as there is a personal drama going on with one girl in the film. So, combining all the genres into the film... you get not a bad movie but not much interesting either. I must say that Russell and Ryan were really good in the roles. But the little girl - Angourie stole the film. I think she was really awesome and believable. Kim, on the other hand, seemed absent even when she was talking.Must say also that half way through the film, I could not really get why or who or what is going on with missing girl Amelia. And the whole dead porn star M M thing was kinda ... weird. But I do confess that the whole porn industry of the late 70's thing was kinda cool. Not bad, but it was not brilliant either for me. I rate it seven.",7,0,1,10 August 2016
The Martian," Not bad
","So, as I am writing this, the rating of the movie is 8.2 and I agree with it.The movie is entertaining. The story is interesting and grabs your attention. I think there are not many scenes which are boring and the time of the movie ( which is more than two hours) does pass fast. However, although I like disco music and those Gloria Estefan and Gloria Gaynor songs are cute in the movie, somehow, I feel that those uplifting songs are a bit misplaced in the movie. Don't know what kind of a soundtrack would fit better, but this one is ...It was kinda strange to me that the Martian did not start to look thiner sooner considering the lack of food and all... Yes, there is the scene after shower where we see him very thin and bruised, but, I think it is kinda too late. OK, I can imagine someone being determined to stay alive, but I also believe that all the tasks would not look so easy. So, that kind of plausibility was a bit off for me.I read this is a low budget and all ... I did not know that or noticed. But I did wonder where they shot the movie... Moroccan desert or Arizona? It did not look very Mars to me.Anyway, not bad. Certainly better than many of the space movies I have seen.",8,3,6,12 December 2015
Atonement," Not bad
","My main disappointment was the ending. I think it was totally out of the blue and as if the film was suddenly cut and other film was paste as ending.I liked the atmosphere of the film - especially first part as it was very Agatha Cristie.All in all, not bad.7 from me.",7,1,2,11 December 2019
