The Rock," There is no @#$%ing money
","This is great stuff. Love the rock; its straight outta the A-team except that people die and the budget is huge to boot. You will like Connery, the 'Who Really killed JFK bit', Cage, Spencer(the FBI guy, real slimy), the great shootouts in the morgue, the coal carts(?! just what was that place?) and the lighthouse. Not a documentary, not meant to be taken seriously, but Very, very entertaining, loud, some funny parts, well acted...Ed Harris helps tie things together too. I think that it works as a fine pairing film with Armageddon and Con Air, and recommend it to all who liked those two films too...",Null,1,1,25 September 1999
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," If you liked the first, you'll like this one, too.
","You have some differences, certainly-a buried Olmec/Mayan treasure in Mt Rushmore instead of Roman treasure under NYC, Helen Mirren shows, and Ed Harris instead of Sean Bean as the baddie-but...this is most Def. a sequel. They stayed really close to the outlines of the first, and from what I can see-that was a wise decision.Acting wise-just remember, Cage is Cage, Ed Harris is stoic and bad, Voight and Mirren a bickering couple of old pros, Keitel is there for the $ and Bruce Greenwood, shines as the prezzie. I liked the techo-whiz Bartha plays too, pretty fun lines all in all for him.I always enjoy it when they trot out the old conspiracy/legends-here it's El Dorado/the Lincoln assassination/some secret Book that only Prezzies have access too. Pulp level X-files, in other words. They play it straight, which is very important here. These are what Stephen Sommers was doing w/ the Mummy Series, save for he let things get outta hand for the last one. Never a good thing.Things to enjoy-the waterworks, the see-saw of death, the Antiques Roadshow stuff w/ the prezzie desk, all that. You gotta love how all these old gear/wheels/traps/devices work Just the way they're sposed to first try in ages, but hey-that's all part of this genre. Ignore the goofiness that you find throughout and it's a good ride.Plus you get a couple bogus car chases, too! who could ask for more? Give it a shot, it's a good time, esp. if you liked the first one or like Bruckheimer stuff in general.***",7,2,5,22 December 2007
Angels & Demons," Pretty good, nothing outta the ordinary thriller.
","You go into this already familiar w/ the first movie, that or the book. I thought it was a decent, fast moving thriller, w/ odd overtones of a James Bond Villain Plot(TM) in it-an antimatter bomb?! in the Vatican-REALLY?-that works on the intended level just fine.The cast-all are in standard forms here-Starsgard, Hanks, MacGregor, etc-you won't nec. believe they're who they're playing-but they pull off the roles as well's can be expected. It's a superficially written screenplay that emphasizes the settings-cathedrals, Vatican city, Rome, etc over characterization, suspense and following the clues over anything resembling a realistic plot.I thought they were respectful of the church as far's they needed to be, and really the Vatican has nothing to fear from movies like this. Sheer entertainment, nothing else.You can spot the baddie semi-easily despite a couple red-herrings, you also could use more info about the main killer I suppose as to what makes him tick. But whatever-they're just devices in the plot nothing more *** outta ****, you'll get what you came to see nothing more.",6,1,3,23 May 2009
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Think 'Field of Dreams' meets 'The Natural' with a golf club...
","I loved this one. You go into it thinking, it's gonna be hokey, sappy, boring, trite, etc-and no, it isn't that. Instead, Redford works his 'Natural' Magic here in a way that is believable, sentimental in the best meaning of the word, and very, very moving by the end.  It's a flick about someone losing and finding their Self again, bringing their gifts that they thought they'd lost forever in their Youth, and magically retrieving them in a golf game  to end all golf games. Semi spoiler or two below!!Matt Damon basically comes off as being a big goofy kid at times, he is So babyfaced that you think of him as being maybe a couple years outta college at best, not some 30 year old scarred-up WWI vet. But he pulls off the role just the same, you can kinda buy him as Payne Stewart, a little.The guys playing Hagen and Jones were right on the money, Hagen essentially a Babe Ruth of golfing type, all cynicsm and smoke, complete with turbaned Gunga-Din style Caddy and gaggle of groupies, while Jones is shown as the typical athletic golden Boy, all class and business. I think they were well-written roles indeed.Charlize Theron is beautiful, of course, the camera simply loves every minute of her onscreen-she seems to me to combine the right elements of Kathleen Turner, Michelle Pfieffer and Goldie Hawn. I thought her performance was quite effective, and its too bad she is semi-written outta the flick once the game gets underway-standing on the sidelines and reacting to the matters at hand much the same way Liv Tyler does in Armageddon.Bagger Vance, of course, is essentially a guardian angel, of the links, very well done by Will Smith. He underplays it just the right way, I enjoyed seeing him onscreen and hope he can do more roles like this. It's a tough role to play nowadays-basically he's a soothsayer and advisor, but because its a black guy being a Caddy, you know the PC-hordes in the media are gonna be screaming 'Stepin Fetchit!' from the word go, though the character is anything But. Nice bringing things full circle at the very end, too.I found everyone in the audience enjoying this thing all the way through, it is funny, touching, exciting, beautifully filmed. If it has any real weaknesses, you won't read about them here-cause I didn't see any.***1/2 outta ****, hole in one of course.",Null,0,1,5 November 2000
Frost_Nixon," Good if inaccurate in places.
","Just going to do some bullet points here...*Sheen as Frost is pretty good. Had a Pythonish quality to him.*Langella as Nixon is good/bad, fine actor but this was Richard Little in level at times-that bogus Nixon drunk-dial sequence, for example? Egads.*The spinning of this at the end, where it's shown as being some Mano-a-mano bout, w/ Nixon clocking him first three rounds and then Frost getting him at the end, didn't quite ring true. There's a grossly false misrepresentation of how this interview affected Nixon afterwards. Frost is rightly shown as soaring career-wise from there on out, but Nixon? they make it out to be his failed last stab at rehab, and fading into the woodwork.Where were these clowns during the Reagan years? Hello-?? Nixon as in Comeback Nixon was ALL you heard about there-he was the Foreign Policy Guru, esp. on China and Russia, he was on the cover of Newsweek-I think the headline was 'Nixon is BACK?!-Yes he is', of course he turned out the books and etc. as well.I'm NOT a fan of the man, at least not the whole Nam/Watergate period-Nixon did some horrible things and is lucky he didn't wind up in jail. But to cling to some liberal wankjob of saying he never came back or whatever-that's a narrative that ain't gonna hunt. That's grossly, terribly, FALSE and wrong. He did. Period.Try again Richie.",7,1,4,6 July 2010
Walk the Line," Very good. Reese steals the show.
","But you will appreciate what Joaquin Phoenix does here too. The only thing I didn't like about his portrayel, someone else here mentioned--they sucked the joy right outta Johnny Cash's being. This guy came alive on stage, he loved what he did, and I just somehow reject the constand Brooding persona that we see played out before us.Phoenix could have added more on that side I think. But beyond it--I have no real problems. The staging is good, the concerts Highly believable--here you get Both actors--non-singers at that, to Sing the stuff and sound at least Reasonably like Carter and Cash. That was a shock. I would have liked more of the Folsom Prison concert, and maybe a Billy Graham(played by Franklin?) cameo, but okay--that's more Johnny from the '70s anyhows I suppose.Best of the movie--Reese. She is great. She was believable as a singer, she was a 3-D person, firey, spunky, smart, living in a tough shell. You did want to shake'em both about not getting together sooner, but nevermind. Oscar time for her if not Phoenix, I think he will get a nod too.Enjoyed the bits of Elvis, Orbison, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee, Waylon(played by his son!), etc. Those were fun and added some local color to the preceedings.They left out Johnny's night in the Cave when things were at rock bottom, and the business about setting a park on fire from a leaky truck, but never mind, they got the high points pretty much. I did think that it dragged some in last half-hour and that we could have used less of the druggy scene and more on his actual music and recording. The man was an artist after all, of some Very strong merit.Kudos to Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne as his folks too! *** outta ****. Check it out.",7,2,7,19 November 2005
Gremlins," Hoyt Axton as inventor?
","Oh this one is funny, it has some great, key film moments and images of the 80's that you won't soon forget if you have seen it...the Gremlin in the Nuke, for example; Hoyt Axton farting around with his inventions in the background, including an egg-beater/fly swatter that you see whizzing about in the background, the Gremlins singing 'hi ho hi ho', one turning to the other and saying, basso profote voice-MILK DUDS!, the other saying 'YEAH!' and leaving right before the rest get nailed, etc. etc.This was so much fun back in the summer of '84; even Phoebe Cates traditional semi-nasty 80s chick was softened here; makes you wonder whatever happened to Zach Galligan here myself..A good flick, worth seeing of course.*** outta ****, fun.",Null,1,3,5 September 2000
Antz," Antz-Bugs with life....
","Best Woody Allen movie in ages! Ditto Stallone! I liked this a lot-the battle was right outta Bug Hunt-I mean, Starship Troopers, kinda over kill in places but not bad-enjoyed the voice work of Christopher Walken, Gene Hackman and Sharon Stone also. Kept on wondering who was Barbados(Glover!), Azteca(kept thinking it was Sandra Bullock-nope!(Jenny Lopez) and the queen(anne Bancroft-knew the voice-but...)You will enjoy the action, esp. the end, the big wrecking ball(what a clever idea!), the f/X, and the major Theme-Individuality is Good(ala Bugs Life, by the way....) All good.Hollywood does seem to have a penchant of doing the same thing as the next guy-two ant films, two asteroid movies, two with volcanoes, etc.-here both versions are welcome, well done, and quite different. Personally I have to go with Bugs Life-the circus, PT Flea and F/X struck me as being just that much better. But you can't go wrong with Antz, either.*** outta ****-quite good.",7,0,1,5 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Phantom Menace; Lucas carrying on the good fight...
","I saw this about 3 days after it came out, having waded through scads of disappointed reviews and a month of hype overkill. Saw it with a full theater, they all clapped after it was done, which is Not something I had experienced in AGES. And while the film was on, I enjoyed it.So what do I think of it, some 4 months after the fact?I think it was quite a good film actually.Bear in mind that I saw Star Wars when it came out in '77, and loved it then, and really liked Empire too. Jedi I thought was okay but the Ewoks needed to be DDT'd in a hurry. That was a bad move on Lucas', jumping on the '80's cutesy toy craze(Cabbage Patch, Smurfs, Carebears, etc.) though it did bring in the $$...he shoulda known better.This one had too much Jar Jar, but I found the guy to be kinda funny and definately a great FX; which they simply grew way too fond of and jammed down our throats. Not needed. But what made the film work were other things...the resolute, staunch Princess, the terrific Senate scene, the Pod Race nearly knocking you through the back of your seat, the fine light saber duels towards the end, the bringing back of some old pals(R2d2 and Threepio), the city scenes showing us the capitals and etc...Unreal. I also liked the big battle at the end, though the Battlebots weren't all that impressive if you want to know the truth.This was a superficial film in places, but since we bring such a huge weight of expectations and history to it, it give us more than it would if it were the first in a series, no Empire or whatever back when. I like to think that Lucas tried his best but was a bit rusty, and will get better at directing when #2 comes around.What is needed to make the next one improve: Punch up the characters and dialogue some. Let Samuel Jackson and Ewan MacGregor have big roles and be Interesting. These are a pair of dynamic, talented actors, I hope Lucas Uses them. More Jedi stuff is needed, what makes them tick, after all? And he really needs to ditch the cutesie stuff, no more Jar Jar and more yoda would be a help.And if he is going to have a baddie marketed all over the place, ala the way Darth Maul was, he really has to give him time on screen to warrant the attention; and make him come alive as he did Vader.  Maul essentially had a few cameos and then was Basil Rathbone vs. Rob Roy there at the end for the big sword fight, it would have been better if we'd gotten to know horny better before all this..But enough. I liked Menace a good deal, give it a *** outta **** rating, and hope that Lucas lets someone else help with the writing AND the directing; so there's more OOMPH to the proceedings.",Null,0,2,23 September 1999
The Sound of Music," Anything with the KooKoo song works for me...
","This is great. Those who hate it are full of it and really, REALLY prefer crap like American Beauty. Gimme a break. I saw this in the theatre as a kid, and it was a family event every year also to watch it on TV, everyone sitting around together enjoying a classic. Andrews was on an unbelievable roll at the time-Poppins and then this, two HUGE hits '64-65.The music, acting, scenery, etc all tops. I usually dislike musicals too and are bored to pieces by'em, but not by this. I also can remember when they showed this as a part of a 3 day long film fest at my college in the mid 80s-THIS was the one everyone wanted to see, place was PACKED.Don't be fooled by the Bozos who dump on this-it's one of the best.***1/2 outta ****And yeah, that KooKoo song is still fun...",Null,0,5,12 January 2001
Catch Me If You Can," Lotsa fun, based on fact.....
","Moves right along, believable as far's it goes, I enjoyed everything from seeing To Tell the Truth w/ Kitty Carlisle(STILL AROUND!!) and Joe Garagiola, to the opening retro-toon graphics, all the way to the end. Leo is the best I have seen him in ages, believable and smoothe vs. clunky and sleepwalking. I liked how Hanks played against type-Knock Knock-and wound up showing his character had a heart, too.Spielberg is to be congratulated for pulling this off.*** outta ****.

Raiders of the Lost Ark," Indy! After you!
","Great film of course, terrific fun, excitement-you hadda be there in '81 when this one came out. The impact was enormous. This is a tribute to the '30s-40s serials, sure-but its better, and it has a such a good cast-Harrison Ford IS Indy, Denholm Elliot of course adding class to anything he touched, Kate Allen was right on the Money, and of course we got both John Ryhs-Davies as Sallah,never better-and the LATE(that was a surprise!)Ronald Lacey as Toht, everyone's fave Peter Lorre type sadistical gestapo rep.Of course I got a lot outta watching it, and still do now. Hope that the new one they crank out is as good as this--but then, take a looksee at the sequels-they're good but def. not up to Raiders.**** outta ****",Null,0,0,25 January 2000
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Debra Winger's voice?
","Yup, or so I have been told...of course I liked this one, it was moving and very well made, probably shoulda beat out 'Gandhi' for best flick that year, but Sod it-it's the one we remember now between the two films.Best parts include the Bikes in the sky, the ball being rolled back to Elliot and the closet scene(Yoda, anyone?)...there is a lot to be said about this one, of course.Nice touches include Peter Coyote as the sympathetic scientist and the D and D game, the Sesame Street clip and Dee Wallace's nice turn as the mom.**** outta **** of course.",Null,0,0,5 September 2000

","Holds up really well, 'improvements/alterations' or not. Always wondered what happened to the older brother too-MacNaughton? Odd looking guy in the recent pix now. Anyways-it's kinda dated in places-the D and D game, the BMX bikes, etc-but that's unavoidable.

","There are Scads of things to be said about this one that others here have all said before here. I will add that its as great as its reputation, having not seen it until I was 25 or so-I didn't really know what to expect. Needless to say it delivered on all accounts, and then some. My personal faves are Lorre, Greenstreet and Raines, backing up the Usual Suspects of Bogie, Bacall and co. By all means, see this one.

Minority Report," Good mix of 'Bladerunner' and '1984'...
","....Where Big Brother is Watching You-and knows what You are doing ahead of time......Very interesting premise, carried out by Cruise, Speilberg and co quite nicely. There were some story arcs which were right outta LA Confidential-esp a certain shooting-but nonetheless, it all works.The only real trouble I had was that it went on maybe 25 minutes or so too long. You expect a finale at point X and then when it doesn't come, and you get a Cruise Narrative sequence to boot-it does bring to mind Speilberg's recent Filmaking as Taffy routine. Stretching it out beyond it's natural barriers. But that's just a minor quibble on my part. I liked the design, the whole 'bleached out grey cinematography' right outta 'Private Ryan' and 'Lord of the Rings', quite good.It's also great to see 'Leb' from Armageddon too.*** outta ****.

Training Day," Mixed bag, good acting, so so plotting...
","......I am sure there Will be spoilers below!Okay, this movie. I hadn't seen it 'til yesterday, some 3 years or so after it came out and Denzel got his Oscar. Alrighty. It was like Narc and Deep Blue, maybe? but w/ the obligatory non-actor rappers making extended cameos-Dr Dre, Snoop, etc. amidst the carnage and shaky cam.I enjoyed seeing Cliff Curtis, considering how good he is in Three Kings etc etc it's fun to see him playing yet another hispanic though he is a Maori in real life. I didn't quite buy Denzel's character being able to do this routine and get away w/ it for so long, I also thought that it made our police force out to be a pack of mercenarial rats, far from the folks I know who are in the force for real. That-ain't them.I agree that the little 'wallet pic/call' scene was bogus, you def. had to let the disbelief suspension kick in bigtime for it.Denzel is very good, focuses, believable. Ditto Ethan Hawke. You get nice turns by Scott Glenn and Eva Mendes as well. I am not so sure that this will hold up down the road, but for what it's worth, sure it's worthy of seeing.

In Bruges," It's pretty good. Very clever.
","I liked it a lot. Bruges the city is beautiful and a medieval time-capsule, full of boats, canals, cobblestones and 'pointy buildings' as the midget says there. Gleeson, Farrell and Fiennes are all quite good, Fiennes is quite funny in a vicious limey way, while you find yourself rooting for Gleeson despite his day-job, you know? It's certainly a movie about some rather unpleasant people-hit men who snort coke, kill total strangers in cold blood, swear at one another 100 times a day and basically meander thru life. The midget is an angry racist, the girl is a coke dealing petty thief, and of course her bf is a 'lollipop man' who likes holding people up as well. He gets blinded for his efforts.I'm not sure if at least Some of this is meant to be a spoof-'this is the shootout'-some great lines all through--but it does play like one, at least a bit.You might wanna check it out if you don't mind some violence, a deeply cynical edge and unpleasant people doing nasty things in beautiful backdrop, Bruges Belgium.I liked it and do recommend.*** outta **** at least.",7,1,3,5 August 2009
Chinatown," Quite good, but over-rated seems like......
","Well, having bought the DVD of this lately, I finally sat myself down and watched Chinatown w/out any commercials. Thank you AMC. Anyways-just what exactly was this 'JaaaaCK' movie/throw-back to the '40's noir flix all about? Why is it praised to the high heavens? Got me.Here's what's good: *Jack Nicholson. Reins in his scenery chewing and gives a terrific, focused performance ala Bogie or Mitchum. I liked this a lot.*Stylish camera-work, period detail, etc. Polanski nails it.*Supporting work by Lopez, Huston, Dunaway and Burt Young, all fine. Huston is clearly a scary SOB no doubting it.*Involving plot, and Towne was right--water rights and reservoirs aren't quite the same as Maltese Falcons--they're believable and mean huge $$ to those who can corner the market.*Downbeat ending. Yah sometimes the baddies win.What's not so good: *Quite slow. This has that '70's d-r-a-g things o-u-t pace, you do wish they'd hurry parts of it along some.*Polanski and his knife cameo. Like bad Joe Pesci. C'mon guys.*Hated seeing Faye get shot.*Dull sorta film overall. You sit and wait for something to happen, and besides a few fights or near drownings, nothing much does for long periods of time save for Jack being...Jaaaaack.Overall--***1/2 outta ****, Godfather Too was better, but the Conversation, that was the best for '74.",7,13,23,17 May 2005
To Be or Not to Be," You've heard of that Great, Great actor....
","Terrific movie! The opening gag with 'Hitler' walking out into the street is a scream. Tense, funny, satiric, suspenseful; with some of the better bombastic teutonic actors in the business at the time: Lionel Atwill, Sig Rumann, etc. Much fun! Love seeing 'Unsolved Mysteries' Man there at age 24 or so, as a leading man type. (Lord-Robert Stack's almost 10 years Younger than me in that film...) You also get to see how good Carole Lombard was, and it's sad she was dead before the movie was out.If you have ever wondered about just how good an actor Jack Benny was, check this out.

And the old part about 'Get away from my juniper berry bushes' is a hoot also.But some of it seemed rather forced, they made sure to stick the real Christ in there so as not to Really offend their audience, then preceded to hammer him the rest of the way. All well and good I suppose, as it IS a Python film we're talking about here...but this thing seems to run outta gas around half the way through; nowheres near as funny as Holy Grail or any one of a dozen good Fawlty Towers episodes.Somehow I think Benny Hill could have pulled this off in a 20 minute skit and done just as good a job--but then that's me.*** stars outta ****, nice try.",7,2,15,5 October 1999

","I enjoy this one. I even bought the 'ultimate DVD set' for my neices! This is one Disney toon that really stands up. You like the songs, you enjoy the Eddie Murphy Comic relief, and the action is quite well animated too.They did a pretty decent job of capturing the china locale, the local color, though they did insist on turning the Mongols into aliens, complete w/ a Karl Malone-ish leader, that is true. You read about the Juan-Juan or Hulagu or Attila, seems to me that they were portrayed as being far worse by the Romans, Chinese, Arabs etc. Remember it's only a cartoon.Nice voice work by the lead, by Weinstein, Osmond(singer), Sulu, Mr Miyagi, etc. I don't see much wrong here you know?

Kevin Spacey is okay but so what? He was much better in Usual Suspects and the Negotiator. Gwyneth Paltrow as always seems vaguely emaciated, and the main co-star, the smothering rain-was as much in the way as anything else.Don't go see this unless you have always wanted to know what the cause of a Scripted Barfing marathon looks like.

Unbreakable," Slow-ish but Good-ish...
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I liked it. From the comments here, you'd think that this was on the level of 'Freddie Gets Fingered' or something. Hardly. This has alot more going right for it than wrong. These are...:SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!Good Willis performance. Sad, something missing, something out of synch in his life, typical blue collar feel to his characterization. Willis was believable and I thought quite committed to the role.Sammy Jax was OK though what was up with that Buckwheat hair? Hmmmm. I liked him here, interesting kinda character to be playing too.Robin Wright(of Gump fame) does her normal 'strained beauty' bit, didn't see anything outstanding one way or another with her.  I thought the kid was okay too, basic sitcom kid w/a '70s haircut. That was cool too.
As far as the build up, I liked it. I liked the old 'Spidey Sense' that Willis had whenever he bumped into baddies-a jewel theif here, a robber there, a racist thug there-very nicely done. I liked the slow pace of discovery. I liked how he was shown slowly trying to piece back his marriage/family together through all of this. And I liked the hints from the past-the pool, the accident-which showed that his 'Unbreakable' ability was real.The battle in the house with the home invader was nicely done, and a kinda realistic Superhero doing. It's not like Dr Doom is waiting around the corner with an army of DoomBots, guys. The whole falling into the pool was quite good too.I also thought the ending-where Sammy Jax is shown to be the guy who derailed the train, blew up the hotel, etc etc-to be a little unbelievable given his inability to fall down stairs without breaking into 100 pieces-but at least it lets us in on what his character was truly all about. And it's supposed to be a comic or homage to comics, you do need that arch villain. So they gave us one.Good job.*** outta ****",7,0,0,15 July 2001
Citizen Kane," Over-rated. A Classic groundbreaker yes, but Not the #1 flick of all time.
","I rate this an 8 here on the IMDb scale, don't get me wrong. It has great acting, writing, editing, pioneering make-up, writing, flashy as anything camera work. But that is about all you can say, ya know? It's a LOT, but.....I can't imagine putting Casablanca, The Searchers, or the Third Man beneath this. Welles was NOT believable as a 66 year old lurching around his mansion wrecking 'Singer'-wifey's old room. I thought that scene was laughable. You could just see the make up lines etc on him, Cotton, 'Thacker'--it was great at times, but others-clearly dated and applied with a trowel.I don't think that the story of Hearst here actually did WRH justice. Having read a rather decent, thick bio on the man this past winter, I can tell ya, there was much more to him than just a cold distant mother, being spoiled, and buying up half of the European artworks available. He was a combo of Murdoch, Trump and Willie Wonka, if you think about it. Plus Marion Davies was Not a singer, but an actress who actually had a fairly decent star run in the 20's on screen. She did wind up a drunk etc but c'mon.....This film is done w/ tons of conviction, style, very impressive to look at. I'm not so impressed w/ the overall effect though--I didn't care that much about Kane, I didn't quite see what made him into such a 'Monster', as compared to, say, Harry Cohn, for example, nor am I sure that all of really adds up to much.I put this up there w/ other movies like Annie Hall, the Gold Rush and Vertigo. It's a very well made movie, it is more than worthy of having in your DVD collection and reading about; but it's also frankly guilty of being a Sacred Cow for critics and writers too. I don't see how this is all THAT great. Putting it over even something like 'Notorious' or 'the Third Man'--doesn't hold water for me. Just an opinion for what it is worth.**** outta **** of course.",8,1,7,1 July 2005
The Rookie," Very good, and true, too...
","A fine story about following your dreams and actually taking a stab at Doing something about them when the chance strikes. Nothing was easy for Morris either-he had a family, job, job opps elsewheres, a mortgage, etc-it wasn't like he could just drop what he was doing and blithely hop on the greyhound to play AAA ball for 4 months. It took guts. I am glad that they showed his indecision, almost up 'til he got the callup to the majors.
I can remember seeing him pitch against the Red Sox(I think...), it was a great story. Though Morris actually looks more like John Kruk or a Mills Watson than Quaid-that's okay. Quaid does a very good job playing the man, the teacher, coach and 'oldest rookie'.... As someone who is in the the same age group, I certainly can ID with his plight. You're not Quite too old to do what you had dreamed of as a kid, but it's getting there. You have to do it sooner than lator.Believably told, nicely edited, paced, acted, good to see the familiar faces of the late Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here.

The Birth of a Nation," period piece
","This one needs some historical contextual understanding  to better appreciate. It was the equivalent to Titanic at the time, a record setting hit, with ground breaking fx and the like. Nowadays, sitting through-it's a bit of an endurance test-LONNNGG!!! The racism inherint is kinda sick too-the blacks are Vile gorillas to be beaten down by the Great KKK-that is hard to put up with, for me at least. People running round in blackface usually don't cut it post-1930, either.
So...what can you say-it has some good acting, and definate spectacle, battle, etc-but you don't get to appreciate it if the rascism gets in the way.Myself, I give this a mixed ***, but for its ground breaking stuff at the time-the content is sorta sad if you must know.",Null,2,5,21 October 1999
Memento," Good, over rated here though...
","It's hard to find fault with a flick that dares to be different, is well acted and pushes it's Unique Conceit(here the Reverse Mode) right to the end. Not a problem so far. Guy Pearce as always, quite good. Always think of Russell Crowe when I see him-LA Confidential days-here he has done a fine job. Guido the Killer Pimp Pantaliano is fine too-has that Taller brother of Joe Pesci act down as always. Moss was okay if a little shrill. Can't say that I followed some of the threads that well, or particularily bought the Unique Conceit as much's the rest here did.  And I wonder how this would play if someone went in, and reedited it 'back to front', so we could watch this in linear time. Would it make as much sense, much less have everyone oohing and ahhhhhhing here? I doubt it. I really hope they don't go out and try repeating this formula either, here it's pulled off well but would be completely incoherent in lesser hands. Yikes.This if anything was better than Pulp Fiction, another one of the most Overrated things I ever saw in my life. This is better.I would give this about a ***1/2 outta **** for effort, execution and just for the sheer brass. But is it as good as Godfather or Lawrence of Arabia?

","I saw this one finally today, night of the Oscars, a year after it won it all....Well, I think I'm gonna have to watch it again, because I was busy reading something and whatever while it was on-I started to lose track of who was who, thinking Ben Afleck was Marlowe(Nope-Rupert Everett!), and thinking, over and over-Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth was better, deserved the Oscar, Judi Dench playing '' didn't deserve squat because she made a forceful 7 minute cameo-big deal, she probably merited the award two years ago for playing Queen Victoria in Mrs. Brown instead. It's interesting how many people were in both Elizabeth and this one-Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, etc. and Blanchette Does look like she could be Paltrow's sister too, doesn't she? Oh well, enough on that.I didn't get much outta this-some of the characters seemed to pop in from nowheres, and I felt this wasn't a heck of a lot better than the 'Taming of the Shrew' episode of Moonlighting from back in '86, to be honest.Saving Private Ryan was better. But so were Elizabeth and Thin Red Line, too. I would give this thing *** outta **** for some good performances and etc, but I think that Miramax really should give the Oscars to their PR guys, they're the ones who REALLY performed, seems to me.",Null,1,4,26 March 2000
Iron Man 2," Pretty good, not as good's the first one though.
","I think this one falls into the Spidey II mold-mucho personal introspection on the part of the hero, his flaws come out in a big way, and there's a rather drawn out flat section of the movie where he's Not Iron Man, and it does drag things down some. They were going for more charcterization I realize, but-it's kinda slow.What works? Downey Jr. as Iron Man is up to par as he was in the first, it's quite good. This is his role.Paltrow as Potts is okay, but they did make her out to be a shrew.I liked Scarlet as the Black Widow, not on screen all that much but what they do show is perfectly fine.Baddie's plot-well the Crimson Dynamo(Rourke) teams up w/ a rival arms builder(Rockwell), to field an army of Iron Man-like Drones. Takes'em out w/ Cheadle's help. Mucho explosions, shooting and flying around. I would have liked a couple more scenes like that during the movie, honestly--just to help the pacing.Roarke is okay as Vanko there you just don't see him doing that much save making Drones, hacking into networks and slicing up a couple Le Mans cars. That part was fine, by the way.Check it out though, a good way to open up the summer--though you can be forgiven if you think you've seen parts of this before-Robocop or Transformers esp come to mind.*** outta ****",7,0,1,9 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Like the first one, just a little better.
","What's not to like here? Depp is back and does his Keith Richards/Pirate combo schtick very nicely, Orlando Bloom and Keira K are fine in their roles, the Kraken is a WOW of an effect, Davy Jones is even better than Gollum, and you have to like his sharky/snaily/seaweed etc henchmen too. Great stuff.What doesn't work so well? Okay, the last hour or so is slowish and the movie is about half an hour too long if that. It's also Clearly a set-up for the third one.*SPOILERS* I thought the appearance of Geoffrey Rush from the first was great, at the end, and I also thought the Kraken closeup, if you will, at the end, was terrific. All teeth and tentacles. You could only imagine things like that back in the day, Harryhausen included.Check this one out if you liked the first one, the fencing, stunts, cannibal island segment and the like all work rather well.

Rocky V," Low key, not bad wrap up to the series...
","Stallone brought this outta the attic and used it one more time back in '90; and to my thinking he did a pretty good job-this time with Rocky losing everything(ever see what happened to Aaron Pryor, Mike Tyson, Tim Witherspoon, Jerry Quarry-it can, does and has happened, folks...) and winding up back where he started from, streets of Phillie.Here we see him become Tommy Morrison's manager, see Morrison win a number of fights, turn his back on Rocky, go bad, get into a filmed street fight with Stallone, lose, and see Stallone, his kid, Adrien, Paulie, etc. wind up with their respect and etc. back, if nothing else.Talia Shire and Burt Young are okay here, nothing special. The kid is nepotism on parade (but nowheres near as bad as Sofia Coppola was in that year's Godfather III, by the way, Talia Shire's neice too...), Tommy Morrison adequate but nothing like his cousin John Wayne(of course...), Morrison being a real boxer(who has had drug problems and now Aids...)does lend some credibility to the fight scenes themselves.Some of this-the rap and whatever, is already real dated, and not as interesting to take a looksee at as the others before it.

I did enjoy Depp but thought he was 'sounding like Ringo' instead of the Keith Richards(!) impression others have seen. Whatever-it worked. He's great.Kneightly is a sweet slender surprise as the girl, Legolas there does a decent job but does have a block of wood edge to him that he might wanna work on. Of course you have Geoffrey Rush chewing the scenary as the Pirate Barbossa-he was about the best thing here along w/ Depp.

",".....you know, Aslan being brought back from the dead and all. Who would have thought a movie about a talking lion, beavers, rhinos, cheetahs, etc centaurs, satyrs, etc-would be so moving and involving? I never read the books, but respecting the writer CS Lewis very much, I more than wanted to give this a chance.It's well worth your time. Sure there are Lord of the Rings type backgrounds and imagery, sure you have to suspend disbelief(talking beavers?), and you wanna swat the second boy a lot, but still-this works and works well.Tilda Swinton as the White Queen was great, scary, believable. I liked all four of the kids, esp. the youngest-Lucy. Good jobs by them. You will enjoy the battle-harpy eagles dropping rocks, a bombing run anyone? and root for the good guys.Weaknesses? Well--you don't get to know who is who all that well amongst the menagerie of animals; esp. the centaur, rhino, etc that show up towards the battle, the kids sorta accept their fates/roles quicker than you would imagine, and the ending sure seems odd. Tacked on, etc. They were inside Narnia literally for Years, then whap! back on the floor as they were at the start, mere minutes after they'd left.But that's just carping.

Public Enemies," I enjoyed it. Good turn by Mann, Depp, etc.
","Fine treatment of the well-worn Bonny and Clyde/John Dillinger Thirties gangster stuff. Johnny Depp plays Dillinger sorta like he did Donnie Brasco, save for the fact he's on the baddie's side for real. He's not that sympathetic here, there was some lip-service paid to his Robin Hood like tendencies, but overall-he shoots up alotta the midwest, he robs banks, he gets involved w/ the mob, the FBI comes after him bigtime, he winds up dead at the end.I was happy to see familiar faces like Stephen Dorff, Stephen Lang and Ribisi in here, but they were not introed the way that you'd like, and it took me awhile to fit them into the story lines or remember who they were(actors not parts). Lang is always very fine and should be used more.I liked the shootouts-yes this was done by the Miami Vice/Heat director. You can certainly tell that.The FBI was handled well, good turn by Crudup as J Edgar, and enjoyed seeing their phone system surveillence being showcased. J Edgar was all about bugging the lines and using that info for his advantage, did it for 50 years and did it well.I was not thrilled by the shaky cam. Lose that. Less is more.The 'girl' is well acted and she's a beaut. They could have made more for her in this and not lost a thing.They play fast and lose w/ the factoids-but I don't care. I see all gangster movies as being heavily geared towards entertainment, screw the history books. Who cares? Also, it was GREAT seeing Myrna Loy/William Powell/Clark Gable up close on screen. I was actually MORE interested in seeing Manhattan Melodrama than I was This, to be honest.*** outta ****, it's a bit long and it's nothing great.

This time out, the big glaciar walls are breaking, they're headed south to some natural-formed ark, Skrat's along for the ride, hilarity ensues.I enjoyed the mammoth as possum gags, the under-water fights w/ the shark things, the CGI animation is clearly improved, the voice-work is just as dead-on now as it was in the first.Clearly you'll like this if you liked the first.

","I think the general consensus is that This is the comic book movie of comicbook movies. Yah I would agree w/ that--right there w/ the first two Superman flix 25 years ago. Here you have a character played and written true to the source material, well acted, fighting a baddie that is equally authentic and well played as the hero is, directed by someone who really, really likes his characters.Spoilers??

Yes I know what that was for of course.You will love the two main fights here-between Doc Ock and Spidey on the train and on the tower, it's impressively done, suspenseful and Looks Like a Comic Fight Should Look, easier said than done of course.I also enjoyed the interplay w/ his aunt, Mary Jane, JJ Jameson, the fun cameos--hey it's Stan Lee! the VH-1 guy! Bruce Campbell! etc-and you can't go wrong seeing Dr Connors (the Lizard) skulking around either. That would be interesting-Dylan Baker as the Lizard?

You gotta like Willem Dafoe and Brad Garrett doing their things especially. Many fun gags-the Pelican(Geoffrey Rush!) and the Cliff Clavin fish school...great.
Lotsa heart too-you care about these guys an awful lot more than you do the live actor portrayals in 'Matrix Reloaded', within the first 4 minutes. This one will live on for ages as a classic.

Think of this as being in the vein of 'The Rocketeer','Tombstone', 'StarGate', 'Anaconda' and 'Congo'. It delivers on exactly what it promises:horror, chills, nostalgia, good FX, a bit of tongue in cheek-what more could you want?Brendan Fraser is just right as the Indy type hero, Rachel Weisz seems to have a good time as the heroine, all wide eyes, pluck and screams...and the guy playing The Mummy, hey-he can squint with the best of'em.Personally I am glad this movie was made, and that it made 155M here in the US-showing an audience is out there for pure adventure/no strings attached.*** outta ****, a definate go see.",7,0,0,5 October 1999

I think this was a fine movie, kinda traditional in its story telling and rather 50's/60's Spartacus/10 Commandments.

You won't have Ahnold in it all that much(CGI cameo at end), you don't have Cameron directing it certainly, and you are always aware this is #4. But it works.I liked Worthington though he is somewhat of a block of wood, still I rooted for the Marcus character and I liked what they did w/ him. The little deaf-mute black girl is just a prop and doesn't do much, but for whatever reason I wasn't bothered by her being there. I had to think hard to realize Bryce Howard Davies there was the Claire Danes character-they didn't give her all that much to do really.Yelchin as Reese is very good, Bale mostly is one-note Johnny chewing the scenery, Ironside isn't on enough, you know. The F/X are quite good, the suspense of going into Skynet in SF and rescuing the prisoners tense and well handled, etc.I'd say give it a 6.5 outta 10, **1/2 outta ****.

","I enjoyed this overall-Williams as the baddie under-plays though it's kinda like his take on Kevin Spacey's nut in 'Seven', amongst others. It's Not Oscar calibre, put it that way. Pacino was pretty believable too-reining in his usual Thunderous Speaking Intonations for a change. I liked the corrupt cop he plays-one that tries hard to do it right but has let the realities of the job and world he lives in change things for the worse.Couple spoilers below am sure!Complaints are few-Hilary Swank as a cop, well-that is in Lauren Holly/Picket Fences territory. Sorta believable but not very. She was okay though. The monkey business involving planting of guns, bullets, etc was a little too involved for it's own good at times, and you had this unintentional comedy of the Al and Robin foot race. Here you have 5-6 62 year old Pacino sposedly racing after 5-7 51 year old Mork, thru rocky foggy Alaskan beaches, over logs, etc. You could spot the body doubles a mile away, at least.(I lost a great grandparent in one of those log jams, trust me they are no laughing matter)As for the ending, trite but 'poetic justice', the flawed hero gets his too.

L.A. Confidential," Very good noire for the '90's...
","I remember when I saw Siskel and Ebert review this, they gushed on and on about how great it was, and how unusual it was to find two new faces-Crowe and Pearce-that deliver the goods as well's they do here. I have to agree. Having seen it twice, I'm always struck by how good Crowe is-he's halfways between Bronson and Mitchum, able to propel a flick forward through charisma, guts and charisma. Pearce gives a good performance in the straight-laced Tom Cruise role(think of the Firm, for ex.), and I think is easily Crowe's equal. He hasn't done as much high profile stuff since-but with 'Count of Monte Cristo' and 'Time Machine' coming up, maybe that will change.You can't fault the cast or acting here-David Straithairn as Hugh Hefner(more or less-does he remind anyone else of Bill Bixby? does me), Basinger and Stretch Armstrong esp. At times it's hard to follow some of the plot-twists-esp. connecting the movements of the black suspects to everything else-but it does fit if you just let the film happen. I did of course like Kevin Spacey's unusual casting as a macho, on the take cop/Dragnet consultant-he almost pulls it off too! He of course is incapable of a bad performance.Certainly the final shootout is a little Die-Hardish for a pic that is trying to remain 'real', but I liked it anyways. I wonder how much of this is based on actual historical events too.As for Basinger's Oscar, I don't see it-sure she was fine here, but-it's kinda like Sharon Stone's nomination for Casino. Soap opera moments and decent performing does not greatness make. Oh well.I donno how to rate this vs. Titanic, save that Big Sinking Boat does stick in the memory somewhat more, while the acting in LA Confidential is a cut above.

X-Men," 'What would you prefer, Yellow Spandex?'
","Every once in a while Hollywood gets the Superhero genre right. They did in the first two Supes films, Batman #3, and now here in the X-Men. I liked most of the performances, thought the costuming and characters were played straight and remained true to their source material, and felt that director Singer respected the genre most of all. He had some $$ to work with and didn't waste a penny.I enjoyed Wolverine most of all, as seems to be the consensus, but will also say that I Liked Halle Berry as Storm. She didn't have many lines sure(and in fact had a real tongue tier in one scene--oh sorry)but you hadda like how they showed Ororo in all her lightning bolt hurling glory.
Rogue and Cyclops were good too. So were the villains. As I stopped reading the Xmen in the early 80s, I can't say that I remembered Mystique or Sabretooth that much, but the rest I sure did. The XMen are a part of our culture, its nice to see that Bryan Singer has done them justice.McKellan and Stewart were quite good too, by the way, I agree that Stewart's scenes seemed to be a little truncated, but what he does have, works.Hopefully the next one will be longer and include likely villains ala the Sentinels or into more of the classic characters-but I agree with some here, you don't wanna jam in TOO many people, it's hard enough to get the ones already included straight or introed properly to the novice fans out there as it is.So...I give this one *** outta ****, its good and they should be congratulated for turning in a solid effort which could easily have been Really awful.Want proof?

Most of the complaints about it are true-to an extent: overlong, way too stuffed w/ lazy writing devices(the Butler, Harry's constant switcheroos, tacked on ending), too many baddies(More Sandman/deep six Venom), strangely truncated Gwen Stacy role(Cameo! say wha-?), etc. So sure, I can understand the bitching here. It's also too long, and some of the Emo Peter stuff was lame and for the birds. But you know what? Though it suffers from Lethal Weapon III-ness, it DOES work, despite itself. Sandman's great. Spidey/Gobby II fights ditto. JJJ is a hoot, as always. The whole Saving Gwen routine w/ the crane from hell was fun. I did think they over did the 'combat/heroics while falling' stuff over-much, and yeah, once again, you had MJ doing the damsel in distress routine at the end, but it was still pretty good. I did think the Dumping Petey on the bridge after being threatoned by Harry part was the low-point of the whole movie, for what it's worth-none of that worked. The much-abused butler was lame too but you can live w/ it. I actually got a kick outta the whole 'Twistin in the Kitchen'/'Stayin Alive-the Spidey remix' routines, but they do seem to have come in from a neighbouring set, ya know? This was clearly meant to be the last of a series, let's hope if they come back to it-they trot out new writers and let the Lizard/Electro do their things. Raimi seemed like he was stretched here.

I did enjoy some of the whole cliffhanger highjinks involving that leaning skyscraper and the rescuing of the damsel in distress, though the whole segment was idiotic-screw it, that's a monster movie.I THINK the Monster is dead at the end-NUKED, you have to have SOME amount of believability here, ya know?

I remember the news--500,000, 800,000, maybe up to a million people were butchered. We did Nothing. White people from away got out, and that was all. I have always been a Clinton fan but that was his worst moment, being too scared of committing to another Somalia to do so much as send in a single GI.So here you have the Hotel, a four-star swanky oasis during the genocide's, w/ Don Cheadle bribing every general or bigwig Hutu in sight to stay alive, stay in business, and keep the huddled Tutsis inside alive for yet another day, a week, month, 'til freedom finally comes at the end. Cheadle is incredible in this. He deserved an Oscar.It's played very much as a Schindler's List goes Africa, from the point of view of the Hotel. You wind up only seeing the violence here, here, and there, whenever the sea of war hits the Hotel itself before moving on again.The most jarring scenes--the van load of Tutsi's surrounded by militia in the street, w/ a desperate Cheadle bribing them to their freedom, the 'bumpy road' which turns out to be acres of bodies lying hacked to death as far's the eye can see, and of course the separation from his wife. I found myself wincing especially in the 'bumpy road' section. The mind reels at such ugliness, and cannot grasp the sheer magnitude of what really happened there.Kudus to Nick Nolte and the actress who played the wife, both were top notch as well.Do check this one out, it will break your heart and anger you at the same time.***1/2 outta ****",Null,4,5,5 March 2005
Gettysburg," Pretty good....
","Most of what I could say about this others have already said before, so I will keep it brief...Good points:Acting-Sheen, Jordan, Daniels, etc all fine. Nothing great, mind-but it works in the context of the film.Historical detail/accuracy-Great, they filmed it onsite, the uniforms, weapons, etc army tactics, etc. all have a ring of authenticity to them.Level of Importance factor-this wasn't treated as just any other battle, or as a typical day in the life of Robert E Lee-and that is good, it sure wasn't.I liked it quite alot.Bad Points:Too long-a 4 hour plus flick? It plays better as a mini-series I think, and a damned goof one too.Dialogue-Stilted historical speechifying galore. Some of it-Lee before his officers, for example, makes sense. But alotta it is stilted and way too formal. If Gen Armistead needs to go answer the Call of nature, I think here it'd have been accompanied with strings and 9 paragraphs of the historical significance of it all. That coulda been done away with.Pacing-Slow. More action was needed, believe it or not. The scenes around the fire were somewhat sluggish.Gore factor-mostly an old fashioned 'show the body fall' but none of the Platoon, Private Ryan guts stuff. Maybe more of that was necessary?But that's about it. I look on this as being a fine achievement overall, kinda neat to find out Ted Turner and Ken Burns had little roles here; and I have zero problems with the soldiers being portrayed by reenactors-who Else should have done this?? the local Nat'l Guard??*** outta ****, pretty good.",Null,3,5,28 January 2001

","I think that this is a very good realization of the 'Khe Sahn/Hamburger Hill' types of battles our guys got mired down in Vietnam from the day they entered to the day they left. Brutal, violent, exciting, moving, full of familiar faces, well acted....it's kinda 'Black Hawk Down' in 'Nam.
Gibson, Elliot and Pepper are all fine. I also liked scenes of the French troops early on and the inner workings of the NVA HQ as well. It adds just THAT much more to the film as a whole. Kudos also to Madeleine Stowe and Keri Russell for the domestic stuff. Yellow cabs causing grief and fear.

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Hmmmm....well...
","This one I have always felt a little disappointed by. I like a lotta things about it, and overall the film is decent-but I have never thought it held up as well, or was true to the spirit of the first two as much as it should've been.Here's what I didn't like:The Ewoks suck. Can you say 'Carebears'? Smurfs? Monchichis? Gummy Bears? Well the Ewoks are right in keeping with'em. Nope! Not good! A simple $$ grab by Lucas. I wish he had edited them out and replaced'em with his original Jedi idea-a planet of Wookies. Now THAT I woulda bought...
Harrison Ford Thorazines out for the whole film. Clearly glad to be getting done with the series. He and Billy Dee Williams weren't all that into it from what I can see. Some pretty flat performances. Too bad, too. They have done better work elsewheres.No way in hell Han Solo winds up playing Delta Force man on the ground, not the Han Solo I know from the first two films. He'd have lead the attack on the Death Star inside his ship instead. Yanking him and Chewie outta the Falcon and plopping them onto the moon always bothered me, kinda like making Indy Jones drive an 18 Wheeler. You know he could do it, but WHY BOTHER ?!!! Oh well...characters not staying true to their histories always yanks my chain outta joint. Here especially.I never bought the tacked-on 'Luke and Leia' as siblings bit either, now THAT means that Owen and Lars aren't Luke's relatives after all, nope-they are Obi-Wan's...Somehow I really doubt that is what Lucas had in mind back in'77. Takes some of the intrigue and fun outta the first two films if you think about it.And I thought it was wayyy too Muppetty, the whole Jabba sequence makes me wonder why Lucas didn't just CIG Fozzie and Animal in there too while he was at it...Gimme a break...I didn't mind Jabba himself, though. Pretty cool.
What I liked:The final attack on the Deathstar, and the whole space battle are both great; well handled and believable as far's they go. Right up to par.I liked the Emperor, little more like an evil Merlin than Emperor to my thinking,but fine, he was convincingly slimy, evil and in control. I think Diarmid did a good job in Phantom Menace too.The final big sabre-duel with Vader and Luke is pretty good if laced with overblown dialogue and all that, somehow I never can concieve of Anyone beating Vader, don't care how strong Sonny boy had become. But they did a good job, the Emperor's demise and then that of Vader is handled well, having a lot of excitement and pathos mixed in to boot.This film nowadays bores me, I have trouble with the Ewoks big time and can't get past some of the things I mentioned above; but it certainly is a good film-if you like the Carebears or the first two in the series a lot....myself...I give Jedi a *** rating, for the effects and whatever, but it should have been a lot better, more coherant and tighter paced...",Null,0,3,24 September 1999
Scary Movie 2," THUD! thunk.
","Yikes this was awful. The whole 'James Woods on the john' bit was embarrassing to say the least, (now WHY are we parodying a 28 year old movie guys?????), the acting pretty awful, the gags just wayyyyyy too sick and over the top. It also has a fatal flaw of being Slow, dull and boring. I kept on looking at my watch, and everytime Chris Elliott came on screen I wished I had simply VCR'd it instead so I could fast forward by him. Very badly thought out material, in order for an Airplane or Blazing Saddles or Hot Shots flick to work, you need to be at least FUNNY and COHERENT and INTERESTING. This was None of those.

Pan's Labyrinth," Pretty good, unique, doesn't quite go where you think it will.
","I enjoyed it for the most part, the F/X and overall production are great, the imagination certainly well realized, it's a fine film.There are a few debits: the jarring contrast between Franco's pseudo-Nazi goose-steppers and this gamut of fauns, fairies and monsters-it doesn't always work that well. You half-expect Captain Vidal there to run head-first into the Faun and meet his comeuppance. Instead, the girl dies at the end and is received into a paradise w/ her parents on the thrones, the communist guerillas have sacked the mill and everything's, well, hardly a bed of roses.It's somewhat of a downer, esp where the mother dies and w/ the torture scenes...I donno.

","I enjoyed this more than I thought I would-sure you hear about the dead eyes, the over-kill of fancy CGI F/X, Santa's city being a little too-Triumph of the Will looking-but you know, all of that really doesn't add up to much.I thought the kid characters were appealing, Santa was somewhat of an imperial Lord of the Realm going about his business, the whole Train-ride pretty fun to watch, the elves clones but about what you'd expect-Christmas elves.Basically Zemeckis, Hanks and co. get the job done. You have enough 'Real Spirit of Xmas' stuff there to make you think, there's some nice turns by guys like Eddie Deezen and Michael Jeter(his last), the train-over-the-lake-ice esp. well animated and exciting as well. For CGI, this is unusually well-rounded stuff(okay, Mo-Cap, whatever-it's STILL CGI)-and must have played really well in those Imax theatres, hence the high Box office etc. seasonally.I'll give this one *** just because it works.",6,2,3,30 November 2007
Lost in Translation," Slowish, decent movie but not a classic....
","......am always happy to see that Bill Murray is back to being in the headlines for his movies and etc--what, the last time before this was 'Groundhogs Day' in '93? That's a while back. Here he plays Serious Bill, essentially the same thing he tried in '84 w/ Razor's Edge and Theresa Russell. That time it didn't come off too well, some were saying he was too young to be having a midlife crisis.Well, at 52 or so, he sure is at that stage, and here brings it off quite well. I also enjoyed watching Scarlet, she seemed to be so lost in the big Foreign City, and feeling trapped. I bought that-her performance was pretty good though I kept on thinking 'Kirsten Dunst' whenever she squinted to the left as she does.Fun Cameron Diaz sendup by the 'Scary Movie' chick here--nails the typical airheaded starlet quite well. Good scenery though it's true the 'Stranger in a Strange Land' bit has been quite done to death by now.I had a feeling at times--the party, the nightclubs, etc--that I was watching a pseudo-late 60's flick, it was slow, too long, chaotic and semi-random in places. I wanted to see them DO something besides shuffle around Tokyo and tearfully part too, her wearing his coat, etc. But that's me, I guess.Anyways that's my take on this.

Like everyone else, I am very impressed by the first half and like the second part but realize it's nothing special. They shot some of the Nam scenes in an old Tractor factory if I remember right, and it shows. I remember the long tracking shot of the whole line of GI's talking to the camera and saying who they are, etc. That stood out.But the first half--brutal, effective, sad, frightening at times...you have to like that, Kubrick there was at his best.

Anything with him there was good-in fact, like the first one-just not enough of the head baddie. George-c'mon guy....What doesn't work? All the complaints you have heard-Hayden and Natalie being blocks of wood(yes), flat acting, bad dialogue-sure that is all true. I found it hard to sit thru their lovescenes without wanting to paraphrase what they were saying in a more realistic way. Naturalistic dialogue is prob. harder to write than it seems-but it can be done. Lucas should prob. not write the dialogue and let someone else(Steven S??) direct. It would help.What's good? The Car/chase/city scenes/Jetsons meets Dukes of Hazzard stuff. Very good, fun, roller coaster ride.  Boba and Jango are good. The fight on the clone base is good. Ewen MacGregor is quite good all thru here too; they just needed some equally believable performances from the leads too.
There was an attempt to lighten it up-ala the pseudo-Han Solo asides of Kenobi's, more action, and I think that did help out. Lucas spends too much time on the techie side to make the drama work out as well's the action, and w/ the actors all working with blue screen-it prob. does get difficult for them to connect with what he wants.But no matter-more to like here than not.*** outta ****, Yes it's better than Phantom Fink Menace; and prob. better than Jedi too.

The film shoulda ended before they started the whole Forrest Running across the USA  bit; instead it got milked and milked even farther than before.Gimme a break.I liked Hanks' work here, and some of the direction, but the whole film struck me as being an overlong episode of either the Twilight Zone or Quantam Leap.

The Godfather: Part II," its good----BUT
","IT's not as good as the first one. This one is convoluted; some of the plot twists arbitrary(just who ordered Micheal Gazzo's attempted garroting? Who killed Frankie Five Angels? etc.) -it kind of plays like a film with a script that was being revised even while it was being shot.And face it-no Marlon Brando-that is hard to make up for, you know? His presence in the first film was partially what made it such a classic.
Now-don't get me wrong-I like this film a lot. Micheal V. Gazzo is one of my favorites and anything that used his talent to good effect is alright in my book. Loved Lee Strasberg doing the Meyer Lansky bit, terrific performance. Pacino, Cazale, Keaton, etc. are all great. This film has great suspense and some tragic scenes(Fredo goes fishing)-and I liked the parts showing the Senate's investigation of the Mob. All well and good.Can't say that about the flashbacks, Deniro is alright and the tone is fine, but it Really does slow things down in a big way-I don't think you'd lose all that much if they just had yanked that chunk right outta the film completely. Allegedly Coppola was thinking of doing just that while making this, but didn't. You decide. It doesn't work as well for me.Overall, a very good movie, ***1/2 outta ****.

","Well, this film is over rated, from what I can see, but it IS well acted, atmospheric, bloody in places. A fine character study, especially by William Macy and Frances McDormand. I think both deserved Oscars. You really do believe McDormand-to a point, and feel for Macy as his world crashes down on top of him.Personally what I liked best was seeing Rockhound and Leb from Armageddon in an earlier film, Buscemi is a scream and a very talented one too no matter what he tries. Enjoyed seeing Leb too, although he had maybe 7 words in the whole film. He is a Brutal spud in this isn't he.Couple questions: what happened to Macy's wife-was she killed or what? We don't get to see her after a couple scenes in the 'hide out', maybe she was wood chipped....And two-why was this such a big deal? Good film yes, but-an Oscar contender? Somehow I don't think so. If you want to see a well acted, lower budget film from 1996, set in an out of the way part of the land, with some realistic characters...Might I suggest you try LoneStar, by John Sayles.

Unreal. Nails it.Kate Beckinsdale as Ava Gardner. Very good--Marcia Gay Harden was better though 12 years ago in the Sinatra mini-series.Flight sequences--Hell's Angels or the Spy plane that crashes or the Beetfield landing--you get right into it and this delivers. Those crash scenes. Wow.What doesn't work so good? Parade of long-ago Hollywood names-Errol Flynn, Linda Darnell, Faith Domergue--yah Howard had his starlet harem, but I am sure it's a stretch to find many who remember either Faith or Darnell unfortunately. (Who remembers Jean Tripplehorn today, for example? That was 10 years ago....) Martin Scorsese kinda rammed that stuff in a little too fast at times.The long, long segment on Howard's madness gets hard to watch too-peeing in bottles etc. Yah it's what he became and what he is remembered for now unfortunately--but in the 3rd hour, it does slow the movie down badly.Alan Alda as Sen Brewster during the hearings-that's very good. I liked that part.

Manhattan-well he's sorta the Silver Surfer, the Vietnam parts of this w/ him worked well. Some of the cast looked lost-Malin Akerman is getting razzed for her performance, I thought she was OK but brought nothing much besides a long set of legs to the role to be honest-and to be fair Matthew Goode as Ozzy was a joke. I thought his CGI Kat in fact gave a better performance.(The less said about the Seriously goofy Nixon/Kissinger stuff, makeup, etc-the better.

I liked how Damon came off-usually he is either too goober looking(big dum lug ala 'Private Ryan') or goes the other way-plays the Boston area ivy leaguer(most of his roles...)...This was done the right way.
What was that little red car they go racing around in-a Peugot? Fiat?-what a pip.

You don't buy the 'remote control traffic lights' scam or the idiotic level of thinking Norton displays-and why is he alone like this, no retinue, no bodyguards, etc?-but for the time being as you watch the film, it's alright.Best parts are the trucks falling thru the streets, the racing in the tunnels, etc. It was fun seeing the Ukrainians go after Norton too.

It's more in line with the first Star Wars-albeit BELOW THAT in Quality-YES-or maybe the Longest Day. It holds up great-but it ain't perfect. Deal with it.*AtomiK Bloo Galadriel is the Worst scene. Yikes. Get ridda that one. Frodo is TOOO young also-in the Book he is 51 for Pete's sake-in our aging process 35 or so. That kinda takes away from it for me too. You get the cast of N'Synke or the Osmonds equivalent in this instead of the 30-somethings you should have instead.  Hmmm. It's okay with Merry and Pippin, sure-but the other two oughta be older.*I like having more Arwen, the nordic Elves themselves are right outta Winger, Whitesnake and Warrant-paging Bret Michaels-and I can't say that I thought they made the Nine Riders all that scary either. OOOOO one guy alone beats them off with a couple big lit Q Tips. Somehow that isn't quite Braveheart, ya know?*Overall yes I am a fan of the flick AND the books-so you can look at this as more picking gnatcrap outta pepper-but there are things that could go Very wrong in the next couple.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," It's great. Enjoy.
","If you are a fan of the books-you will be very happy with this movie. If you are not, I think you still will be pleased. You will not find a better, more literate epic anywheres in sight.Some complain about the editing the writers did to the trilogy-i.e. no Bambodil,Barrow Wights, etc. Wah. Get over it. This is a Three Hour Movie, Not a TV Series. I see nothing wrong with a few shortcuts, as it is the character names, countries, historical figures and etc touched upon in the film are more than plenty. Jacksson's guys didn't set out to overwhelm the audience with detail. If you want that, check out 'Dune'(or better yet-Don't).Best parts: the Intro, of course, where we get to see Sauron in all his glory, the Orthanc scenes involving Gandalf and Saruman-both Lee and McKellan are top notch, anything to do with Ian Holm as Bilbo, and of course the extended fight scenes in the Mines of Moria.Some here comment that the combat scenes are badly done? Are you watching the same flick I just saw? Nothing of the kind-in fact I thought they were fast moving, brutal, eye catching, violent. The entire Cave Troll lurking for Frodo part was dynamite. I also enjoyed the combat scenes towards the end alongside Rauros.The acting was top notch, I liked Tyler, Blanchette, 'Elrond' and all the Hobbits along with Lee and Ian M. McKellan should have an Oscar headed his way ere long I do believe.The Hobbits brought to mind the Beatles in their moptop phase a little for me in places, I enjoyed the Ike and Mike/Merry and Pippin scthick too. Very good.There were only a few things I thought could have been tweaked in a perfect world. But they are smallish. Orlando Bloom as Legolas was good-but he does have that Ricky Schroeder thing going. Not his fault, mind. He was nicely cast. I liked 'Sallah' of 'Indy Jones' fame as Gimli too. Can't go wrong there.I did think when they had both Bilbo and Galadriel momentarily turning psycho over the ring, it was a Little overkill, more of a Scooby Doo moment than anything else.  And they could have shown more of the trip to Rivendell, sure. I think of Frodo and Sam as being older and more weather beaten, but it was good that they had dirty nails and dirty hands at least-too often its quite obvious characters outside in movies have really just come in from their trailers. You don't get that feeling here.And of course, I also liked the expanded Saruman role, showing him doing his plotting, planning, etc. If anything that was needed more in the books, and it works wonders here.Kudos to Bean, Viggo and the rest, of course.**** outta ****, as good as you could ask for.",8,0,1,29 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," ends fine though a little on the vague side...
","It was well made, starts slowly but gets better. Spoilers maybe!!I liked the whole APU army, the Big Giant Drilling machine(s), heck even the whole Superman like fight w/ Elrond Smith there was good too. But it drags at times, you don't hardly see Zion folks ala Anthony Zerbe enough to care about them, and at the finale-just what Exactly are the Machines gonna do w/ the pod people fields? Letting them be free-what does that mean exactly?
It's fun and violent and you do try to connect w/ the characters though it's pretty cold on the outside. I ignore the attempts at philosophy in flix like this, winced at the whole S and M Wachowski theme and tried hard not to get bogged down in the plot threads.It's not as good as the first one, an improvement on #2, see it for the action.*** or so.",Null,0,0,14 April 2004
Cast Away," Here on Gilligan's Isle.....Skipperrrr!!!
","I know this was meant to be a read dead serious flick, but I kept on saying to myself, at crucial points in this-'Skipper!! Gilligan!' or 'What would the Professor do? Why take that rubber dinghy and the hose and fashion up a MacGyver style Entertainment Center!'SPOILERS BELOW!!Try as I might, I hadda hard time getting as into the characters' pain as they wanted us too. Sure I winced come dentist time, or when he cuts his feet or whatever, and yeah I was glad when he made the fire-but--it seemed somehow or other to be superficial. I didn't for a minute believe that he could make it out into the Wide open Pacific the way he did on his log raft without either starving to death, being drowned or just plain winding up on another island. Coincidence time I know counts in flix, but still...passing over a shipping lane at that very moment a freighter is going by? Surrre...I liked some of the how-does-Tom-make-it bits, him exploring the island, or making fire or clothes or getting the fish or whatever, but the whole Robinson Crusoe thing has been done before, and I think we could have seen more of him there and less with the tacked on ending. I wanted to know him somewhat more, heck Wilson there had as much to say as Tom did at times.And the ending-okay Helen Hunt can't stand to leave her new family, but at the same time, claims she wants Tom still, despite her refusal to see him at the airport. What gives there?? Why weren't we shown more of his transition on the ship then back home, heck even Time and CNN seemed to cover it, surely we the audience deserved that too.Now I liked the fact Lari White(I knew it was a country singer, thought for sure it was Pam Tillis, oh well...)made a cameo at the end, and that Tom's fate is uncertain as that of Terry Anderson's, for example was back in '91 when he came back, but-something is missing here. Someone here points out that Tom and Helen oughta had more to say to one another. I agree.Acting and production values of course are all fine, but-the punchline ain't that great. Maybe they shoulda ended the flick about the time the boat finds him? I woulda...*** outta ****-Tom and Zemeckis are too good to cut it any lower, but Lord knows the writers make it tempting...",Null,0,0,13 January 2001
Lilo & Stitch," This was an absolute scream. Loved it.
","You can't go wrong with this-great selection of Elvis tunes, fun pop-culture references, a great nod to Bugs/Elmer/Yosemite involving a gun and a carrot, ummmm roller-coaster aerial chase, even a little bit of 'X Files' gets tossed into da mix.Plotwise its nothing more than E-T goes Hawaiian, save for the fact that ET here is a dog/alien/Killing machine mix, and the kid-ain't no Henry Thomas. I found the kid and her sister's situation believable(to a point...), the characterizations of the kid realistic-she's obnoxious, lonely, loud, ummm tries to do the right thing but winds up making things worse on herself and her sister in the process, all those kinds of things real kids do. The animation and her dialogue brought to mind Charlie Brown/Calvin and Hobbes at their best, and that ain't a bad source to build on.The Hawaiian locale-hula dancing, garlands, surfing, the music-all done up the right way too. I applaud the way 'Cobra Bubbles/Ving Rhames/Marcellus Wallace Jr.' was Not made to be either the Bad Guy or the Fool-just a hard guy trying to do a hard job.Bravo to the animators who gave us the Laurel and Hardy twins-Big 'Russki Science' Alien and the skinny proper 3PO Envrironmentalist-they were a hoot. Very funny drag/Stranger in a strange land type gags. David Ogden Stiers(Winchester on MASH) has made himself a second career by doing all these Disney voices-the clock in 'Beast', for example-and here does another great job as the Russki Scientist.*2009 Update* This was also the last really good, classic Disney tunes in the 'Disney Rennaissance from '89-02, it was the first big one since '99's Tarzan, it holds up rather well today in '09 too. Odd that Disney didn't keep w/ this same crew, this had potential for more. I think that they overdid the 'Hani means family...' line a couple times too much, and yeah the 'taking aliens for granted' by everyone involved was a wee questionable-but beyond that, not a problem.***1/2, really worth yer time.",8,1,2,30 June 2002
Armageddon," once more to the well gents....
","If that line above makes you laugh, then you will like this move. Steve Buscemi plays a ratty little psycho genius who spits out line after line like that, and had me in stitches. This film is a go getter, pedal to the metal, brains set on stun action adventuror flick to the max. Not a documentary; which I would Advise many of you out there to remember when seeing it.Spoilers below! Warning!!!!!! You root for the oil drillers big time, and I personally felt quite bad when 'Deep Blue Hero-stuff' Man was killed in a crash. I think they should have kept Owen Wilson on. His guys seemed to be the one who was actually enjoying himself up there.I thought the shots round the world, showing the reactions in India, Africa, Europe, the US, Turkey, etc. to the explosion above were handled Very well, the music swells and is quite moving to boot.Other things to look for when seeing it-check out Will Patton's little scene with an ex-wife and his son; where he strains to let them know he has regrets, and is going to somehow go away and make up for his past failings...That is a good scene, well handled if somewhat short. I liked it.Bruce Willis is flat in some of his lines but is alright all in all. They could have used more pacing, and slowed up on the break neck MTV style editing that they throw at us for the whole film; there is plenty going on there to enjoy if you look for it, and they didn't need to race through so fast.Having the two killers from Fargo-Buscemi and Leb there again is a hoot; and you will like Leb believe you me. He actually talks in this film!!! Parts they could have done without-the shotgun scenes(are these the same people who we see on the asteroid, one saying 'I love you!!!' with tears streaming down his cheeks? Hmmmm... I would have liked to have gotten a little more light shed on the Freddy Noonan character too-of the drillers, he is the only one they didn't show either getting rounded up by the FBI or talking to the shrink during the testing. Go figger.Minor caveats. This film is great, big fun, much better than Deep Impact, which makes you want to fall asleep half an hour in. There, they stand round waiting for the earth to die. Here, they do something about it. Give me that anyday.Rating ***1/2 outta ****, definitely a must see!",8,1,2,20 November 1999

I enjoyed the running around the desert in the dark with the baddies only kept at bay with the neon bloo glowsticks. Quite a good touch.At times the monsters reminded me of the X from Outer Space(note triangle head shape), it does make you wonder what they feed on if they only come out every 22 years(each other, maybe??)per eclipse. Great shots of the Saturn like planet in the skies when the eclipse occurs, by the way.Vin Diesel, by the way, is an interesting presence. He should have a good run in Hollywood.The rest other than Imam(general from Armageddon, King in Platoon) I didn't know, which is actually a plus, allowing the audience to buy the characters without a game of 'spot the star' getting in the way.This is worth a couple viewings, better than it has a right to be.*** outta ****, fine B flick.",Null,0,0,13 August 2001

Generally well acted-sometimes Nick Stahl is a little too 'AW why meeeeeee?!' -but that's about what the role required, period.  I enjoyed the great Crane/street/car chase, and the brawling between Blondie and Ahnold is terrific. Don't bother trying to follow the timetravel conventions here, it's convoluted and why bother? It's a flick after all. I agree as well that Claire Danes comes off as still looking 16. Oh well.Good not great summer crunch, def. worth a see.*** outta ****",Null,0,0,19 July 2003
U-571," Good B movie, typical Sub fare, nothing more than that....
","Oh this one was exactly what it promised-an American Das Boot, B movie style. You get all of the 'tube movies' cliches-sitting silently under a destroyer as it drops scads of depth charges all around, causing much shaking and leaking but little else(think the Enterprise after it's been torpedoed-Everyone lurch RIGHT/Everyone lurch LEFT while the computer banks sparkle...), the sub nearly cracking under pressure, many shots fired and not ricocheting all over the place, interchangeable characters who come and go without you either noticing or caring oh you know the drill.The F/X are good without being great or overkill, the music is too loud and 'exciting' when it should not be there at all in some places, hmmmm the Germans can't hit the broadside of a barn from inside the barn but we sure as hell can...you know the drill.But so what? Keitel, McCauneghy, Bill Paxton and co. are old hands at this stuff and do a decent job. Bon Jovi I kept recognizing the face of but could NOT place him. Ditto David Keith (the Secret Agent guy...)...and both kinda vanish.I thought the claustrophobic feel of the subs was dead on, the wire/tube/piston look to the sets and etc. too. What the Token Black person was doing there I donno-hey he was as alright as the next guy, but you just KNEW they had him there as a token ala Ernie Hudson in Ghostbusters. But anyways...See this if you like:Hunt for Red October, Run Silent Run Deep, Crimson Tide, Das Boot, etc. I give it a good **1/2 rating for being a competent B picture that entertains for its two hours, then leaves, not taking anything with it.(Those who are whining about it not being a Documentary, Get a Grip/and/or Life. Name me one film about WWII that was. 'Private Ryan' has all the authenticity of 'Combat' or 'Rambo' in places, save for the opening 20 minutes on the Beach/and the finale in the shattered ruins of France.

","......and there's nothing much here new. You saw them do the full body image capture with Gollum in Lord of the Rings, you saw these cars in Minority Report, you saw the computers go bad in things like Terminator, Tron and the Matrix. It had a vaguely Bruckheimer feel to it too.Will Smith is, well, Will Smith. Pay the man to be the lead and this is what you get. I liked him in the role, never thought he'd be doing a Deathlok/Robocop kinda thing, but okay. Moynahan was a block of wood, she reminded me some of Sandra Bullock in 'Demolition Man' if you can remember it. Her dialogue was just wayy to stilted to buy most of the time.Bad guy CEO you knew was coming a mile away. Ditto his wayward 'Viki' program. I enjoyed watching the plot unfold-especially seeing that Ed-209 type 'demo-bot' demolish the house Smith was in, complete w/ fleeing cat. That was fun.There seemed to be a few things missing; like more characters, the Outside World, etc-the Military, and writing it all off as being 'hardwired to USR' doesn't quite wash.Good attention to 'period detail', the clothes, cars, etc were fine. TOO many product placements though, from the Stereo system to the sneakers to the crotch rocket. Give it a rest guys. We know-the Car was an Audi.What was the 'Michigan Lake Landfill'--trying to read that monument I had the implication that there Wasn't a Lake Michigan anymore, it was sand and a big landfill--true?

American Beauty," Huh?! THIS piece of dreck won the Oscar??
","Joke, right?Nahh, it's no joke, this one won the lions share of glory at the Oscars this year. Why? Because A: it has some really good acting, esp. Spacey's, B: Hollywood Hates regular family life and would Love to consider such a crappy picture of it to be Real, when it is anything BUT, and C: Three Kings was better and got shafted.I don't Hate this thing, but-gimme a break. This is another typical Hollywood screed against the regular American family ala Blue Velvet, the Ice Storm, etc which tries REAL hard to be a 'realistic portrait', when in reality it's about as accurate as yer average episode of 'Dallas', 'Barney' or 'Sanford and Son'(Personally I'd go with Fred Sanford myself...).Everyone is neurotic, shrill, a fake or doomed. No one is like the average regular fellers you and I grew up with, went to school with or are related to(well, not All of them anyways...)..I fail to see what great truths we have here. People get mid-life crisises when they are in their 40s at times. Yeah, so? People have marital problems, sometimes they screw around on each other. And? Teenagers, some anyways, lie about how much sex they've had, or do drugs, or hate their folks. Yeah, this was true in 1958, '66, 76, '88 and it will be true 50 years from now. What is the great point here?I took away nothing from this save that Spacey, Bening, Cooper and co are all fine actors, though I preferred Cooper in 'Lonestar' and Bening always has the same affect on me as Carol Burnette-the teeth get to hurting after too much exposure.The blonde gal was cute but way too Alicia Silverstone/Kirsten Dunst/blonde of the month for me to notice much.

For someone, Malick or Coppola to put their unique vision into a setting like this-AND pull it off-is quite a feat.There are times when I watch this that I'd like more of a straightforward plot, but no one who has seen it-ever forgets it-be it the surfing or the bridge or the playboy gals or the whackjob Hopper scenes or whatever.

The Patriot," Lethal Braveheart Mel--in Knickers and a wig...
","This is really quite good--a def. improvement on Emmerich/Devlin's last opus, Godzilla. That one was kinda poopoo. Here, they take trad. flag waving war films of the 50s, mix in a good miniseries feel(the families, character bits, etc, length), Mel's patented Lethal Braveheart moves, and tossed in big production values.Quite flag wavy, hokey in places, sure--but you have to love it, plus the fact that it was based on a real guy makes it even better. Gibson was fine, solid as always. Got a big kick half ways through the film when it finally dawned on me who the baddie was-kept on asking Who Is that Guy? over and over. It's 'Dr Ronald Quincy from Research, pretty much the smartest guy on the planet-you may wanna listen to him'-from Armageddon!! Boys does he pull it off too, does a great job, in a role that in the olden days woulda gone to either Henry Daniell or George Sanders. We hate him, we root for Mel to get him. Simple as that.Now, am sure this isn't exactly a documentary, the ghost was prob. as flawed a guy as Ethan Allen or Yassir Arafat for all I know. He killed for a living, at least as presented. Big deal. This is a Movie. Remember that first and foremost.Here you can put away the ugliness of real life and sink into a Hollywoodized Rev. War depiction that actually gets it right more often than not for a change.I admire Emmerich for including the random acts of brutality and violence from both sides, so they can actually show what the Rev. War actually looked like. It wasn't just guys in red, all in a line, firing their muskets at guys in blue-with wigs and drums and pipes, it was also blood, decapitations, killed POWs, disease, fires, slaughtered innocents.Devlin and co have put a good chunk of that into this, and for that you are better served.I would give this *** outta ****-too long in places, somewhat over-mindful of 'Last of the Mohicans' or 'Braveheart' in others, kinda hokey-but over all, its the kind of flick that oughta be done more often by Hollywood.Go see it.",Null,1,2,9 July 2000
Van Helsing," Good fun ala the two Mummy flix...
","See it in that light and you will be okay. If you liked Stephen Sommers other movies, you will like this one too. It has over-stuffed everything-too many characters, crazy fights, lotsa cartoony violence, tributes to the old monster movies from the 30's and to current flix ala the X-men and Bond and Star Wars, insanely over the top acting by the Drac Pack-esp Drac, and oh yeah, a fun Hulk kinda nod on Notre Dame with Mr Hyde. I liked it for what it was. You don't go into this looking for realism, a coherant plot or the most adult sensiblities. You get Wolverine doing a Solomon Kane routine, Kate Beckinsdale in a bodice with a sword, 3 models cackling in harpy get-ups ala the Wicked Witch of the West, a fun wise cracking side-kick(Farimir from Lord of the Rings!), decent Wolfman and Frankenstein fights, f/x, etc. They will definitely make a couple more of these, I hope next time they rein in the camp factor somewhat.

They did a bang-up job on the Fifty Foot Gal there(Reese Witherspoon), rounding her character out much better than the usual animated gal is('the girl' or 'the wife' or 'the villainess' etc) and I commend them for it.Oh and the attack on San Fran is worth the price of admission, too.*** outta ****, you'll enjoy.",7,0,0,29 November 2009
Rocky IV," Popeye beats Bluto again....
","Oh Man I loved this one when it came out...the death of Apollo Creed, Stallone standing up for Reagan America in his quest to hammer the Evil Empire's steroided up UberMan Drago. You don't for a second actually Believe that Stallone could kayo Lundgren(Dolph is 6-5-220 plus, a kick boxing champ-Sly 5-9ish, 190) but who cares?! It was great to watch them whale away at one another in Russia like that, surrounded by 10,000 Red Guards, a Gorby lookalike and Brigette Neilson there....Stallone really took to the MTV style of editing in III and does it again here, with the training montages, Survivor/James Brown/Robert Tepper tunes, etc. very well. I personally enjoyed the contrasts-see Stallone chop wood. See Drago pump iron. See Stallone run acrost a snowy field. See Drago run on an Olympic treadmill. See Stallone do crunches while half-suspended from a loft. See Drago bend every concievable advanced weight machine outta shape as he flexes and trains. See Stallone eat his spinach. See Drago take his Steroids....Basically you know going in, Drago has no chance, the old David vs. Goliath thing all over. And you know when Stallone re-does his run up the Phillie steps thing again, this time up a mountain, losing the KGB in the process, that he is gonna win or die, plain as that.The fight is as ratcheted up and brutal as they come, really overkill, over-done, I think that Stallone is knocked down something like 8 times, in truth he would have been TKO'd or put into a coma by the 3rd round. And Drago, too, woulda had to suck soup through a straw and filter for 5 weeks himself...Realism isn't the game here, though. Fun is, excitement, getting caught up in the moment, all of it. This film just could not have been made at anytime save the cold War '50s or '80s. Audiences to intuned to the grunge/ironic/'Whatever'/Friends crap of the first half the '90s especially would have laughed this off the screen or gone to bed. Audiences in '85-86...this is what they, WE wanted, and we got, big time....Things to not worry about in this film, though are debits to the Rocky IV viewing experience--same old, same old performances/roles for Adrian and Paulie. They were brought along for the ride once again, same as Scottie and Bones were for the 19th time in the way too many Trek sequels. And you can't say Brigette got anywheres in Hollywood on her talent, ya know? Just can't see it.

","This one has a tough job of convincing the audience that the main characters, Travolta and Cage, could swap faces via plastic surgery and still be convincing as one another. It works! Woo has a certain style down-the long flowing robes, slow mo shootouts, orchestral hype in the background, furious shoot outs, explosions, etc.  Essentially a more stylish Bruckheimer movie if ya think about it.I have always liked the Bald guy and Gina Gershon here the most from the supporting cast, and enjoyed the way both the leads got to 'understand' the others' family, way of life, friends, etc.  You have to like how Castor gets Travolta's girl to learn knife fighting, for example, or seeing the camaraderie of Cage's group.

He's up there with Jack as the Joker at the least. I think you will like him.The F/X-some complaints around, but why?? In the fighting, the swinging round w/webbing ala Tarzan, lotsa action, believable on their terms, pushes the story along. What's not to like?Dunst as Mary Jane-she's good too. They wrote her a little bland but-not bad.I also enjoyed the cameos/smallish roles for reg. Spiderman characters ala JJ Johnson, Betty Brant, Robbie Robertson, Uncle Ben, etc. The movie is faithful to the comic and stands on it's own.Things I didn't like that much: Well, lemme see-the Goblins' mask is a little 'Go Go Power Rangers!' at times-mouth doesn't move-; it could'a been better, little goofy. The suit itself? Works for me.Ummmmm-pacing is off at times. They take the time to make you care about the leads-which I applaud-but yeah it drags somewhat. Not a problem overall though.Some debits for the score being just so-so and for a couple wince inducing lines/situations(they make ya remember-it's from a Marvel comic!-re:Gobby's lines on the roof to a groggy Spidey), and there are those scenes where Dafoe is talking to himself that are a little close to camp.But these are minor complaints.

SPOILERS BELOW AM SURE!!Okay, it's a typical Tom Cruise vehicle, you know where Mr Mapother can't do anything wrong, he is in reality 5-6 but is photographed to be at least 4 inches taller, he has Rambo's shooting skills and apparently is a track star, too. Sure he has grey hair and plays 'bad ass', but I really thought it was the same guy from 'Minority Report' just in the back of a cab shooting people. Nothing really outta the usual here.Jamie Foxx does the Wesley Snipes/Eddie Murphy part here, and to be honest he's the real center of the movie, the better character. You get to see what he's about from the admitedly excellent Chada Pinkett scene, you feel for his plight-he actually seems scared by flying bullets, bodies and glass! Like most NORMAL people would!-and you hope he makes it out alive.Unfortunately, the movie goes from being brutal but effective on it's own terms to down-right Bruckheimerish about the time they wind up in the club. Foxx suddenly becomes clairvoyent, bluffs his way into see Felix and back in one piece-yah sure- Cruise somehow manages to get into a club jammed w/ 800 people, fire off 55 rounds, not get hit himself, find his targets and miracle of miracles escape whilst the cops are made to be blind-eyed fools. Sure.If Foxx was gonna ape the Dukes of Hazzard, then why not do this earlier? I also found him suddenly being able to go toe to toe w/ Cruise's character in the building and metro-rail just...about as believable as the club scene and their making it outta the car wreck in one piece. You can semi-buy it for filming purposes but it IS a reach.Over-all how is it? I like Michael Mann's trademark Neonjungle Miami Vice world, I thought that at least Cruise and Foxx showed up for the roles, but it just thuds into cliche-land at the wrong time for the last third.It's still worthy of seeing, just-don't go expecting to see a Classic!Must-see because it ain't.**1/2 outta ****",Null,0,1,16 August 2004

",".....few things that I remember about it when it came out-Roger Ebert called it the Best film of 1998(over Pvt Ryan etc? Naw....), it came and went quickly, and no one seems to remember it much now.I liked it for the most part. Performances are good, sets great, F/X unique, storyline ranging from 'Metropolis' to 'the Matrix' from the year after this came out. I was bothered only by a few things--the Freddy Kruegerish appearance of the baddies was not original, to say the least; you never find out where they got these people from who play the lab rats--how much of Earth is left over, what year is it, etc--forget that. Not gonna get the answers.Acting is solid-Sutherland plays a different kinda role but I thought was good. Connelly was her usual voluptuous, soft-spoken 1990's self, before she became a stick. Go back to eating more please Jen. The lead I don't remember from anything else, but he was fine, and certainly an improvement over Keanu. William Hurt does his usual.This was an impressive movie to watch, but I am not surprised it failed at the box office. It's downbeat, slow, murky, and moody. No one is a big name. And you don't get the kinds of payoffs in it that audiences seem to want (paging Keanu again...).....That said, do watch it. It's worth getting.

You don't buy for a sec that they can actually DO this and get away without dying first try; much less not get shot.Some of this is alright-the racing, the obvious KooKoo for Kars approach, the acting OK considering this is nothing more than 'Smokey and the Bandits', and maybe one of those old 50's hotrodder B flix too.
I found that my approach to watching this was to try and enjoy it for what it was-but the farther it wound on, the less appealing it got. The casting of the extras-the gals all right outta Playboy, for example-does kinda hurt even the windowdressing. Yeah sure folks.Vin Diesel is alright here, nothing special. The rest-pretty generic, right down to the hacker/'Spike Jonz' from Three kings type-it's not original in the least.So-did I like it? Ummmmmm-it's okay.

You will enjoy the caper itself, though it's only Kinda believable-everyone they get for the job is an expert, everything works perfectly, the baddies are stupid, everything goes off without a hitch, etc. Semi Spoilers below? Maybe......Debits:Garcia's guys are unbelievably naive, the 'good guys' never spotted for being the imposters that they are, hmmmmm they seem to be everywheres at once, etc. and of course there is this one James Bond kinda device that they get ahold of (again, wayyyyy to easily), hmmmm you get the idea. Right outta the A-Team, Mission Impossible and MacGyver at times.But, these are to be expected.

Independence Day," Randy Quaid to the Rescue!!
","Boys, from the looks of these here comments, you'd think that they were talking about 'Heavon's Gate' or 'Ishtar'...Folks, ID4 is actually a pretty damned good movie for what it is-War of the Worlds mixed with 'Flying Saucers Attack'. It is a clichéd 'Airport'/'Poseidon Adventure' sort of disaster film, with all the stereotypical two-dimensional characters, multi-racial/cultural settings, etc. You see their lives, then Boom! The Squids attack. Nothing more or less. Now I agree-having the Fresh Prince and the guy from the Fly up there in a saucer nuking the Mother Ship isn't exactly outta George Lucas, but it IS pretty damned entertaining jest the same. Personally, most folks I knew who went to see this(only the biggest hit of '96 by far-over 300M at the US box office...)knew all this going in, and enjoyed it.ID4 is NOT a Documentary, yeah we know some race of squids smart enough to make 500 mile wide mother ships and fly across interstellar space aren't about to be Mac compatible, Or suceptible to any sort of computer virus we cook up. Fine! But then, these Squids don't exactly EXIST either folks....Personally I look upon that little computer virus twist as being the same as whatever contraption MaGuyver had conjured outta some toothpaste and popsicle sticks, or the Professor's latest gizmo on Gilligan's Island-impossible, but what the hell? It's Fiction, after all. If it works for the contrivances of the film, that is all is needed. Nothing more.And it worked here, quite well. I enjoyed the ending, seeing the Head Squid look Death in the eyes as the ticker counted down right before the bomb(s) went off in the Mother Ship, I enjoyed both Smith and Goldblum together in their scenes, heck even liked Randy Quaid and Bill Pullman. Judd Hirsch chews the scenery, while many of the others there ARE scenery, it is true.But never mind-it works for me, and who can forget the scenes of all those ships coming in over New York, DC or LA? Not me. Like it or not, those images, and the ones where the Squids really let loose, are going to stay round in film culture for quite some time to come yet.Did I enjoy the movie? Hell yeah! Was it as good as Star Wars? No! Better than most of the Star Trek films? Yup! Would I watch it again or go see a sequel? Yeah I would.Gazzo 2's rating: *** outta ****-good stuff!

If anything that was even Worse than the Clooney/Ahnold neon fest from '97, which clearly didn't have a clue what it was about or where it was going.What works? Christian Bale as Bats, of course. Neeson as the Baddie, always worth watching him. Nice locale shooting in the glaciers, metns and the like. The city looked like Chicago or whatever, a semi-believable city instead of some nightmare of Burton/Schumachers'.I also enjoyed the Ninja-Bats take on things.What doesn't? Scarecrow is hokey and not so effective. The plot was a bad James Bond 'ooo let's poison the Well and make everyone go Bonkers' thing. No one in their right mind would buy Katie Holmes as a DA. She looks 19 if that and just doesn't do it.

It works.Bosworth is a decent actress and quite an eyeful. I believed her in the role for what it's worth, her physique was obviously helped out by some heavy duty gymratting before the shoot too. She was fine.Rodriguez is an intriguing 'what if J Lo were earthy and gave up trying to be Madonna' persona. And as has been remarked on here before, she is oddly maternal for  her 24 years. I like her 'tuff gal' act.Sanoe-wow. Another Tia Carerre type, you spend half the time looking at her and trying to figger out jest exactly What is she? Part Everything. A most enjoyable, unique presance.The surfing? It's great if MTV'd in places.The romance? Been dere/done dat. The guy was not exactly John Elway but you could see him as a 3rd stringer for the Cardinals, I suppose. His two black 'Fridge' pals were fun though.Some of the flick was obvious extra padding-the whole beach fight, some of the 'night on the town with the QB' stuff, etc-it drags the middle down a little.

Saving Private Ryan," Steven Storms the Beach---
","And Washes Ashore.
Here you have two, not one movies, at the price of one. The Masterpiece, is the opening half hour, and the final half hour battle in the bombed out town. In between, we have Sgt Rock characters, with some trendy gore and UN style stereotypes.Its essentially a B film with mass amounts of $$, FX expertise and speechifying thrown in. I always am leery of any film that presumes to 'Tell us what WAR is really like'-that is crap. The only way to REALLY tell it as it is-would be to simply stick a camera crew on Omaha Beach or in Stalingrad at the time, and let'em roll; guts and all.That's it. Here, we have Forest Gump trying to be John Wayne(nice try, but forget it-no way) and a bunch of 20 something directors like Ed Burns pretending they are grunts. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I like the intention of the movie, to show how horrible it all is, and etc.-but the way the film was marketed-its producer telling us its not 'John Wayne up the beach'-that was nuts.Sure guys, it was TOM HANKS AND STEVEN SPEILBERG up the beach, complete with SAM MALONE FROM CHEERS inland to recieve them. Gimme a break.You want a realistic war film? Try 'the Big Red One' or 'Platoon'; and the first 30 minutes of this one, too. Skip the rest, it's just a jacked up episode of Combat, without Vic Morrow's credibility and with old Mr. Gump there....Two ratings: For the Landing sequence and the final battle: ****.

Saving Private Ryan," okay here we go again
","Why is it, the people who made this movie decided it had to be the 'Anti-John Wayne film?' Hell I have a copy of Sands of Iwo Jima, seems to be pretty bloody close except that when, say, Richard Jaeckel or Forrest Tucker get shot, their guts aren't all over the place. But same thing. Sarge Rock time in between some pretty gripping battle scenes. If you have scene 'Platoon' or 'Hamburger Hill', though, you Have seen it before, pretty much.My problem with the Duke being singled out, is that EVERYONE made war films like him-including AUDIE MURPHY, who was Only our highest decorated guy in the War. Speilberg avoided fighting in Nam, and Hanks...he was popping zits when the draft was done away with Jan. '73. And the rest of the cast-Ed Burns, for example, are My age(33 or so-some younger...)who if they didn't go free Kuwaiti oil for Exxon, aren't likely to be vets either...
I am glad they made this movie, sure-my Grandfather's generation that fought in the war deserve no less. But to go after John Wayne is idiotic.
Why not go after, say, more Recent war films, that were bone-headed, flag waving and utterly unrealistic? , I think, if you want to be truly honest, targeting films that we all remember recently would be better.But in all the publicity about this film, never Once did I hear 'Rambo' mentioned. Why is that? Is it because, Stallone, Chuck Norris and Gene Hackman are all Alive, and can Defend themselves Take the Die Hard films, or...Steven's little 'Kill a Nazi for Indy' series, where offing a few dozen German Stormtroopers is as easy as playing Pac-Man! And fun, Too!Gimme a break. Who's being unrealistic and glorifying violence now? Die Hard II had so many bodies dropping, and so many cartoony violent scenes I half expected to see Wile Coyote come flying outta the plane sometime in the second reel....
Fine. Crap on the memory of a star who was the USA's #1 box office guy all time, like it or not, who is DEAD and cannot defend himself.Even though we all know virtually ALL of Hollywood made the same kinds of films back then, even Jimmy Stewart, Lee Marvin, and Robert Mitchum, guys who SERVED in the war and loved the Duke...Enough of my rambling.

The Pianist," Very moving and realistic...
","........I don't have much to add onto what the others here have said-one of the things that struck me was how believable the passing of time. People have slow lives. People have to wait. Refugees hiding in an apt like he was are not exactly racing around to 77 different places in 4 days-they sit, they wait, they hide, they fear that the Nazis will come at any moment, and of course they wait some more. Wars take time. Being forced into a labor camp took time to get thru, slow agonizing months, weeks, days of it. Polanski knows this and shows it. If you want a Michael Bay style MTV jump and cut type editing kinda flick, go elsewheres. This subject matter and this era deserves, merits nothing less than what Polanski gives it.

","I enjoyed this quite alot. Clearly they have taken the 'David McCullough on PBS' Ken Burns approach and run with it, director Ross should be proud that they made it work.*Movie is basically a 'Four legged Rocky' storyline, based on the '30's underdog Racehorse of course. You know pretty much what will happen whether or not you had heard of Seabiscuit or not before. This is not a bad thing though.*Jeff Bridges, Toby Maguire and Chris Cooper are all quite good, w/ Cooper as always stealing the show. Terrific actor. You see him in Lonestar? Well he's better if you believe it in this. *Orfield(?) and other posters complaining that this movie isn't a documentary/compresses time/ events etc-please, lighten up. There is the book and then there is the movie, and neither are gonna ever be the same. Impossible, given the 2 hour running times and etc. Personally, I don't care if George Woolf and Red Pollard didn't REALLY talk at the comeback Santa Anita race, heck it works in the movie, please go with that. If I remember right, Kate Winslet didn't sail on the Titanic either......*This reminded me of the Natural alot too.

You do get into the characters and they made a point of not beating you over the head w/ the message of valuing small towns, home, family, etc over bright lights/big city.All good. The best parts the cow-tipping take-off, with a great nod to Steve McQueen's last movie 'the Hunter', where there is a chase involving a combine. Great stuff.I liked the little Warning Cone hotel, the Italian tire-store owners, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt and of course Owen Wilson. Great backgrounds and a fine, fun, nostalgic array of old cars of time gone by.It's not a great movie, it's too long, and you sorta wish they'd get on with things quicker.

Still, I liked it-the flying and Peter Pan type leaps really were unique. Fit the characters well.Acting seemed pretty decent too. Michelle Yeoh was the most impressive, class and then some, I really wish they had spent more time on her and less on the young squirt she was fighting all the time. But oh well.Problems I had with it-there are a few characters who pop up who I couldn't place, I also missed the fact that the entire Mongol Gobi adventure was a FLASHBACK on the young gal's part. Otherwise I'd have realized who the guy in the Fuzzy Hat(Lo) was from the outset. It wasn't until he showed up at the wedding parade that I put two and two together. Maybe it's me.I also kept thinking that the 'Jade Fox' was not developed the way she could have, kinda shows up two or three times, we don't really know what and where about her as much as we should.And that ending-does the swan dive turn fatal or does she bounce back like a bumble?? 'Tis up to the viewer I would guess.That aside-the flick as a whole is done quite well.

You have John Larroquette(!)playing 'Jerry Johnson'(thinly disguised Carson send up), w/ the NBC brass essentially doing the same old Media rant-One Guy Did it! Shaddap-because We Say So! More or less. Very funny. Ya gotta like that really AWFUL Tonight Show set from '68 and the Ed McMahon stand in too. Fun stuff. Other deleted scenes he puts in, a 50-50 mix of good, bad:The whole 'Mob guys surrounding Costner in the John w/ the police's silent help' scene, w/ a panicked Bill Broussard in tow-doesn't quite fit. How much did Broussard know about this? You really don't quite see why if someone wanted to shoot at Garrison(a big 6-4 type guy) why they didn't just up and do so. This was odd. I didn't quite buy Broussard coming back and being remorseful about leaving the investigation either. Rooker is quite a good actor-here, it was his worst scene.They show Sissy Spacek still living with Costner right before RFK is shot, in the orig. you don't see this at all-instead you see him coming home and making a sandwich in the kitchen, implying that she has moved out already. Interesting.I liked the added dialogue in the 6th floor, discussing the parade route change, Cabell, Bissell, Dulles, etc. But Stone was right to yank it, as it's just one more layer of names, faces, events, connections piled ontop of an already tangled miasma of names already.There was also the short Lou Grant/Jack Lemmon discussing the leaflets scene. That was funny but not terribly relevant.I liked seeing the appearence of Tommy Lee and Oswald at the voter registration  rally. It does add to the litany of mutual appearences the two men made.And did you like seeing Frank Whaley as the fake Oswald, running around w/ the car and talking about shooting JFK at the rife range?  Interesting to see young Moonlight Graham from 'Field of Dreams' turning up in another Costner film, albeit in a much different role.Kudos for adding 'George Moehrenschmildt' too.

Great casting, good performance, it's written w/ him in mind clearly. The girl is a washout, Mr Bland as the potential Other Guy is dull, John Hurt in the Mr Miyagi role works quite well.

Books and flix are not the same and so-you accept that and go on.Some Spoilers below!There were only a couple things that didn't work that well in the Two Towers-Faramir in  particular. The character in the book never tries to take the ring or marches them halfways to the capital city, but of course in the movie he does, then his reasoning for letting them go anyways-it's just flimsy. Either dispense with him taking Frodo and Sam to Minas Tirith or have them escape without his flimsy change of heart. The guy's flip flop-it doesn't work.  Also-the Pteradactyl/Phantom Fink Nazgul attack was FAKE. Some of the F/X in these two flix so far have just been PooPoo.One thing George Lucas doesn't do-whether you like his direction or writing or not-is allow such wildly divergent F/X standards to appear in the same movie. The Helms Deep Battle, Gollum-the black Gate, all are great. The Ents-middling. The Pteradactlyl attack/Warg attack-BAD. Pong/Wizard of Wor level bad, okay? They almost looked stop action in places.

Reagan era war-toys ala this and GIJoe etc were just the DIC-studio produced junk Hasbro stuck down kids throats while I was in College. Nothing more, no interest here.But I do like Michael Bay's movies ala Armageddon and the Rock, so--I thought I would check this out. It really does work more than it doesn't-I liked the set-up of Shia's character, I liked Bumbleboogie there, and it was fun to watch John Voigt doing his crusty politico thing. All well and good.You can't tell the Bots apart though, to be honest-they DO look like walking junkpiles, save for Prime there. That one I do remember just because. They did a decent job w/ him. The much maligned 'sneaking around the house' bit-that was funny. I liked it, showed some humour and character. They if anything needed to slow things up like this later on so you could follow the action.And that's where I did have some problems. Megatron/zoid there is a baddie, but not really introed as such the way you'd like. I couldn't tell his cronies apart-if you didn't watch the show as a kid regular, how could you know 'Starscream' or 'Bonecrusher'? One was a copter and one a cop car, I guess.The fights-really chaotic, lots of action, convincing to a point. You can't tell what robot is doing to the other robot though, it would behoove Bay to pull the camera back some, and for them to be better differentiated next time out. What we got wasn't bad though.Shia was good, the girl easy on the eyes but a flat actress, Turturro embarrassing but then it IS a broadly etched Toon-based flick we're seeing here, he knew it and there ya be. Bay fills this w/ his trademark familiar faces, names (COL SHARP!), music and sunset-drenched stuff. For the most part it does work.Do watch it in a theatre to get the full effect, don't expect anything beyond action, some product placement and sledgehammer level 'subtlety' throughout. It's a decent time over-all, sure.**1/2 outta **** or so, has potential in the sequels to be better.",6,0,2,15 July 2007
Men in Black II," Fun, slight, belated sequel...
","......I liked this more than I thought I would. Again as in the first-guys there's about 20 minutes or so MISSING. C'mon. There's an awful big Universe inside the MIB world--show us more of it, okay? What is there is pretty good as is.Jones was flat. Smith was Smith. I always hate these belated sequels-Gremlins II, Ghostbusters II, etc--either make it w/in 3 years or don't bother. The momentum, good will and etc just seems to be lost between films otherwise.The F/X were if anything very good despite some shakey tentacle shots. Those didn't work too good. Best parts though-well the locker aliens, the plethora of gross-out baddie aliens, the hispanic sounding worm dudes who liked playing twister, etc...you know the drill. Laura Flynn Boyle barely registered despite herself, it was a role they oughta've expanded some. I enjoyed the 'Unsolved Mysteries' send-up w/ Peter Graves at the beginning, very funny indeed, dead-on.I wouldn't mind a #3, but hope if so they don't wait another 5 years, and put more storyline into it.*** outta ****",Null,0,1,15 July 2004
Children of Men," Pretty okay for a 5 buck Walmart buy.
","I hadn't seen this one yet and certainly wanted to give it a try. It's fairly good, but you don't need the slowww pacing, the raft of unanswered questions(why so Orwellian???), and the way they just let the kid go like that in the midst of a firefight-sure....I liked Michael Caine(channeling John Lennon), Clive Owen, and 'Kee'. I thought Julia Moore was fine save that they killed her off rather conveniently a half-hour in. I thought it was rather depressing, the art direction etc very consistent, well realized if suffocating.This is a movie rife w/ symbolism (Mary/Joseph/Jesus imagery abounds), lonnnnnnnng slow scenes, rotting garbage, bombed out buildings and smoggy cities. You will admire the craftsmanship and skill that went into its creation w/out nec. believing what you are seeing.A fave scene was the rotted out falling down grade school w/ the fading crayola drawings on its wall and a wandering deer in the hall. That one I liked.The fight in the woods w/ the biker gang, the cops and the car also is a well done stunt.Oh *** outta ****, maybe a bit less-see it but don't expect greatness.",7,3,7,20 March 2010
Donnie Brasco," Very nice. Retrained Mob flick, well done.
","Believable too.Spoilers below am sure!!I felt that this was quite authentic, I liked Pacino in restrained 'non scenery chewing' role for a change, wish he'd do it more. Depp as the Wiseguy/FBI mole did a solid, believable job, esp. showing how he became like the Mob Goons he was infiltrating-even his wife was worried that he'd gone over the edge. Anne Heche usually is a space cadet, here she was grounded and realistic too.Was Bruno Kirby playing the same guy Joe Pesci did in 'Goodfellas'-both called Nicky Santora, both with the same nasal voice, both triggermen-well it does make you wonder. I think it was intentional.Madsen as the 'Sonny Corleone' character-more or less-was okay if cartoony. Kept on thinking it was Dice Clay if you wanna know. He was that good.I also thought for sure that Randy Quaid was the FLA club owner and Tony LoBianca was the Sonny Red. Guess I was wrong.  Lookalikes.Some goofs besides 'Love on the Rocks' from '81 being played on the radio in a '79 setting. Wasn't Abscam from '81 or so? They kept on referencing it from the 'Abscam boat' or whatever. Again just a minor flaw but it does make you wonder. Edit yerselves guys.The setting, performances, etc all believable.

"Good Night, and Good Luck."," It's great. No more than is needed, and no less.
","I HIGHLY recommend this one. If you have any interest in either McCarthyism or TV journalism's history, this is up your alley. George Clooney made the right call here to only go as far's the record allowed, not to try and make a three hour Stone-like epic, and not get into histrionics. The footage of McCarthy speaks volumes alone.David Straithairn is the best part of this, as Murrow you couldn't ask for anymore. Clooney wisely steps back and acts as the capable supporting co-star and doesn't get in the way. You get some nicely menacing shots of The Powers that Be-in the form of two Air Force Colonels, William S Paley(knowing he has to look over his shoulder at his sponsers etc all the time), and McCarthy's minions in the press and gov't.I am not so sure that the suicide of Hollenback was well-thought out, you get a few nasty columns about you(as an experienced reporter why would he care?) and then you check yourself out? I didn't quite buy that. There hadda be more to his story.The same can be said for Robert Downey Jr's side-story w/ his wife; it's not developed the way you need to make the audience really care about their plight. This is after all Murrow's story, and we get nothing about the guy's personal life.All that aside-this is Oscar material. Daniels and Langella are especially fine as supporters.**** outta ****. It's great. McCarthy was a bastard and good for Clooney for showing us that again.",8,3,7,12 November 2005
Jerry Maguire," show da moola
","It's a good flick, bit of a soap at times, I liked the fact that someone starring for the Arizona Cardinals(!!) is at the center of the flick. That was like using the Expos in Baseball-hey why not?!Cruise is good. He plays his basic tortured Type-A persona Yuppie again, to a T of course. He's engaging.I liked Rene Z though she Does look an awful lot like Jewel-her character is fragile and always afraid of being hurt. It seemed rather odd that they got married so quick, then just as fast looked like they were backpedalling outta it. One gets the idea that it was an ankle deep type marriage and that the 'happy ending' may very well be a transitory one indeed.Guys like O'Connell, Mohr and Beau Bridges turn in some fine cameo-ish appearences. I liked the cynical view of sports and agents in general.

Clash of the Titans," Okay video-game like re-hash of '81 film.
","Good things/bad things about this: 1: Worthington is solid if not spectacular as Perseus. He gets the job done.2: Gemma Aterton as Io the narrative Plot device is fine.3: I liked the Kraken, scorpions, Medusa, harpies, etc.4: Fiennes as Hades was fine save not on screen enough.5: F/X are state of the art, no problem here.What was bad: 1: Couldn't tell apart most of supporting cast.2: Andromeda has a zero part. She is a big deal in the classic myth etc.3: Zeus Neeson is no on screen enough, not much of a part either.4: It plays like a video game. You have zero characterization, motivation, etc save for the fact that they go from A to B and fight things then go to C and fight some more, people die, etc. No real variety.5: Kraken should have been on longer.Kudos for the funny bits including Bubo, 'That doesn't inspire confidence', etc. And what was w/ the mummies? **1/2 outta ****, not bad but you won't remember much afterwards.",6,1,1,2 May 2010
Mission: Impossible II," Reaches New Lows...Impossible is Right.
","I didn't really like this. While I am a fan of the first M.I., and of the Die-Hard type flix in general-I  know, as in every genre, it HAS to be believable on its own terms. And this frankly wasn't. I didn't buy the motorbike stunts-be it the infamous Tom Cruise footdrag at 80 or all the weaving in and outta traffic or the big time Milli-Vanilli chest bump(if you have seen this you know what I mean!) that happens when they both go catapulting off their bikes right at one another, mid air. Followed by a real long, drawn out Matrix style fight on the beach.Why is it that the baddies fire 100's of Uzi rounds, can't hit Tom as he runs right across open space in front of them-but whenever he pulls his 9MM or whatever, in two shots he kills two guys, third shot hits a tankard of explosives which is conveniently placed right behind the now dead baddie, etc. Everything that possible can go Boom(cars, bikes, drums, etc) does go boom here. It's goofy.Unplotted plot, takes the Ebola virus and mixes in the Notorious angle. Thandie Newton should eat something. Cruise does his stunts well but sleepwalks through it all. The baddie is James Bond level. Ving Rhames is OK but that is about it. (I think I saw him play a similar role elsewheres, come to think of it...)Don't even get me going with the fake masks(Tom is 5-7 by the way, the villain is def. taller), and the incoherent plot.Try again? Hopefully with more emphasis on the Writing, though as this did yank in more than 200M at the box office, that's not too likely, $ is the only incentive that Hollywood has nowadays.** outta ****.

World Trade Center," Good movie. Tough, honest, heartfelt.
","I liked this one. Sure much of it has Nick Cage and the other guy trapped in rubble, in agony, grimacing at one another in the dark while they wait to be saved--while outside their Concerned Wives do the filmdom cliché Concerned Wives things--but-it works.Cage didn't have to do anything but keep a stiff upper lip here. He was fine. His partner in crime-same thing, just-a bit ethnic. Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal were both moving in their supporting roles, experiencing several roller coaster peaks and valleys of emotion as the tragic wait unfolds.Stone does a fine job here-the shadow of the plane speeding across the building-sides, the rain of debris coming down, the total ruination all around, the confusion and fear and anger of 9-11, all presented very well. The snippets of people jumping/falling from the towers or of the buildings burning or Brokaw intoning on the TV--these were all parts of that day, along w/ the constant tide of hijackings, crashes, death and confusion. It's handled rather well here.I liked it and it just rang true. It's not something you'll wanna revisit over and over, but it was done intelligently and honestly, and I thought Stone did a good job reining in his JFK-ish bents here.The material deserved no less.*** outta ****",7,2,5,29 July 2009
Black Hawk Down," Very, very impressive...
","If you have ever seen 'Hamburger Hill' or 'Platoon' or 'Private Ryan', you have seen this. And I mean that in all the right ways. What an intense, gripping, sad, violent, realistic flic. I was very impressed, the theatre was full, hardly anyone moved at during the last 90 minutes. Some parts of this reminded me of 'Custer's Last Stand' or 'Zulu Dawn', where all the Brits get surrounded in the valley and mowed down 120 years ago-it's that kinda scenario.I had no idea Ewan MacGregor was in it-which guy was he? Hartnett, Bana and Legolas there were fine. I think that Scott and Bruckheimer are to be congratulated for making such terrifyingly gripping pic as this; and it's right on time too-considering what has been happening in the world of late.****, sure why not? It's as good as a war movie gets.PS: Yeah a lotta Black Somalis are killed in the flick, and were killed in the real world battle this shows from 8 years ago. Deal with it.

Suffice to say that Hopper is great, the PT Flea character a hoot, you will Love Denis Leary as the ladybug(Somehow I thought it was Jason Alexander...oh well! Leary was good), and Bonnie Hunt too as the spider.*Update 10 years later!* I saw this for the first time in ages, it STILL holds up awfully well. It's easy to forget it in the shuffle of CGI movies-the Incredibles or Nemo or anything Dreamworks puts out, but this should be remembered fondly, too. What a clever movie, and it's so cool to have both Jonathon Harris and Roddie MacDowell in this, both now long gone. Ditto for Madeline Kahn.By all means, check this one out. I thought it was one of the 20 best films of '98, and recommend you see it more than once. Good stuff!!**** outta **** of course.",8,0,1,4 January 2000
The Insider," Crowe and Mann were robbed....
","This compared to American Beauty-this is to my thinking a better film, a decent portrayal of a real-life drama that we saw unfold on TV, in the press and on radio. What Mann, Pacino and Crowe have done is give us some of the more kinetic scenes and performances in the past 20 years or so. Terrific stuff at times.I had a few problems with the Insider, mostly in that they try to cram in too much without enough time devoted to them.Gina Gershon and Debi Mazar resemble each other enough so that I hadda really pay attention to tell who was who, and what it was Debi's character did. She has hardly any lines despite being in many scenes. Diane Verona as the long suffering Wife of Wigand isn't really developed into a three dimensional character, and I agree-when she leaves Crowe, we don't feel it as much as we ought.Hall and Plummer also resemble one another enough so that I found myself thinking-THAT is Hewitt, THIS is Wallace, more than once.
And there were a few scenes that did not fit-notably the 'FBI/Geologists in the restaurant' scene. I had no idea what 'arrest' they were talking about, or where this was in relation to the whole tobacco case until they wedged in the Unibomber stuff at the end. Maybe they coulda done without that entirely? I think so.But overall-the acting, the pacing, the feel for what these people went through, I found to be genuine, true, heartfelt, very well done. Crowe at times kept on looking like a guy who was my age(more or less) with white hair, but I still think he deserved an Oscar.Overall, a really goof film, and to my thinking, BETTER than American Beauty.***1/2 outta ****.",8,0,1,1 January 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," Is Good but Dull, Dull...DULL!
","Boys you guys really hit this one on the head, both sides.It is Very well made, the F/X are still effective as hell, yeah Kubrick is tossing out Big Cosmic Questions galore here, yeah Clarke throws in the Vast Universe is Our Pal theme in here pretty big time too.Having first seen this in '76 as an 11 year old on TV and a few years lator in the theatre, I got both doses of how it was meant to be seen. It is impressive.But it moves like lead in an ice storm. It is just So bloody slow. You want there to be Tie fighters racing by the space Stations or a Death Star or even the Swinetrek from Pigs in Space to be out there amidst the floating Dominos, jupiter and Io. Instead you get tons of Wagner tunes, Jupiter bearing down over the ship, a reaallll slow trip to Jupiter's environs, a sneaky computer, a few guys in bad apes soots at the start...that weird Finding the Big Domino in the Moon's crater scene...oh yeah, there's a lot to this all.But-where does it all take you, the coldness of space, of technology, of the future and the Universe? Into some warped Acid drenched trip into hyper space, where you get a big kid floating in a bubble heading back Earthwards at the end....Okay, that's cute guys-now does it mean anything?Maybe its like those Dali flat clock paintings, you get outta them what you put into them...but what I saw just made my eyes glaze over; and I think it's a flick that coulda used some Judicious EDITING(read:SHORTENING) ere it was released.So-it is a classic yeah. And I recommend it to anyone wanting an outta body experience. Just expect to wade through a snoozer of a space trip ere the whacked ending first.***1/2 stars, believe it or not, I truly do admire the effort, though it's about as much fun to sit through as a Ben Stein Clone convention....",Null,1,7,23 September 2000
Blood Diamond," Fairly good movie, about what is expected....
","Reminds me strongly of 'Constant Gardner' and prob. 'Tears of the Sun' if you can believe it. DeCaprio's a rather Russell Crowe-ish character, for the most part you buy him and his Afrikaaner accent, despite a couple slip-ups here and there. He's a smuggler/mercenary sort who is just out for himself and winds up dragging the Diane Sawyer-ish Connelly character along for the ride while aiming for the 'Blood Diamond'. The only way to find it, of course, is to have Hermansou there lead him BACK to the mines, back to where his son is being forced into a hellish child-soldier existence, while all hell breaks loose.Basically this is a road movie-they cover an enormous amount of territory-rain forest, plains, high plateaus, sea-ports; you get the S African army(?) involved, lead by our friend the Mummy(!) Arnold Vosloo-this time w/ a head of hair. No wonder I didn't really recognize the guy-though here he plays a baddie once again. He's under-used, if anything.The parts of this that work the best-again-the depictions of that terrible multi sided civil war from 10 years ago in Sierra Leone, the refugee camps, the attack on Freetown, etc. That's really good, Hotel Rwanda time. What doesn't work-well the attack on Freetown becomes a lot like either Tears of the Sun or Rambo, these guys are swamped by a Black Hawk Down scenario and make it out unscathed. They always seem to find the one friend or crony or good samaritan when they need one in the middle of nowheres. And face it-in this, Leo is meant to be a Rambo-lite.I kinda wondered about his extended death-scene-being drug up the hill w/ a lung-wound, only then to turn round and hold off the pursuing baddies w/ a couple machine guns while Hermansou and son take-off. Sure. It's Hollywood-what ya expect? The movie itself is moving, well made, though the characters are flat and 2 dimensional save for Hermansou thru most of it. Connelly is fine but under-used. They do get the job done, the characters are all flawed beings, the intent was to clearly to educate AND entertain, for the most part I think Edward Zwick and co deliver.*** outta ****",7,1,1,10 May 2007
Men in Black," Enjoyable, too short, funny.

Just...couple of saucers flying around and a big fight w/ a bug. Not that inspiring.All the gags w/ the 'aliens'-i.e. Sly, Whacky Jax, etc-are very good, I liked the F/X by and large, and sure, you have to enjoy Smith/Jones in this. My memory is that when this came out it was expected to be the biggest hit of that summer, and it was-though it Wasn't quite the Great flick everyone was hoping for.I hope they do make a #3, but this time spend some more time on storyline and stop trying to be so cute....*** outta ****",Null,4,8,15 July 2004
Taken," Paging Segal and Norris
","It's okay. It's a VERY '80's-ish action movie, straight outta the ouevre of Segal and Chuck Norris. They cut this one right down to the minimums-characters are presented, spoiled daughter goes w/ airheaded pal to Paris, gets kidnapped by white slavers from Albania, CIA-spook dad Liam Neeson comes after them, does his best Dirty Harry/Paul Kersey on the string of baddies, which leads to a final shoot-out/battle onboard some arabian sheik's yacht in the Seine(!?). End. Girl is rescued and takes singing lessons from Britney(oh hasn't she suffered Enough?!)...I thought some of the contrivances were hard to swallow and Liam's shooting was right outta Dirty Harry, but okay--you need him to be unstoppable if you are going to have a movie. It's clear they left out many bits and pieces, esp. his dealings w/ the French cops and the Albanian baddies.You'll prob. not believe a word of it but you do buy Neeson in the role, if that makes sense.*** outta ****.

This flick delivers.SPOILERS BELOW(?!)-but if you saw the first, you basically know what to expect from the second.
There were a couple time/space/distance situations I did have a little problem with-How did Oded get outta the Oasis Valley and to his troops so fast? In time for the big final battle and etc? Sure guys. Beam me up? And the little 'follow the trail of sand castles' was a little too neat too. Guys-they both Found'em AND knew where to look and all that? Just why was Baldy going to all these places-Karnak, Memphis, etc? Oh well, at least it was a wide ranging flick....That said-I had a BALL at this one-the shoot outs, the expansion of both the Mummy AND AnkSuNaMoon(Sp)'s characters-boys you can tell she is quite hispanic can't ya? He's dutch by the way-plus the whole Face tidal wave/rocket powered dirigible/Bus chase from Hell(Paging Ms. Bullock!) were all great.Best parts-the two huge battles-those dog faced warriors were something else, the Pygmy demons(don't ask-they work)in the jungle, the Scorpionking, etc, very good. Weisz, Fahr and Fraser are all fine. The Rock doesn't do much but grimace but hey, that is what the guy is paid for.Highly enjoyable, many great F/X, stunts, fights, etc. Comic booky premise, characters and etc don't detract from the fun if you go in with That in mind. *** outta ****, kicks off da Summer season in fine fashion.",7,0,0,5 May 2001

The storyline serves a terric panoply of F/X, action, heart and drama.You've prob. already seen this or read the reviews, don't have tons to add. Stephen Lang makes a great villain, Worthington and Uhura there carry off their roles well, Wes Studi and Ripley are welcome additions. I enjoyed the walker bots, the pterodactyl mounts, the hammer-headed rhinos and dayglo sentient plants. All fairly well drawn and realized by Cameron.The baddies lose, the good guy turns and helps out the big bloo katpeople win and keep their planet.

She was pretty good. But of course they kill her off- This sounds like I'm disappointed or didn't like it. Far from it. All the good stuff is there in spades-voice work, characterization, animation, gags, heartfelt stuff, you name it. A good time to be had by all.But don't be surprised if you have bit of a deja vu feeling while watching it--cuz yeah, in ways, you HAVE seen it done before.It's still the best movie to come out this spring/summer so far.",7,0,6,30 May 2009

I liked the opening montage showing Romans, Egyptians and Crusaders up to Washington, and certainly the finale in the treasure room has it's moments. You just keep Hoping that it's there-and when it shows, yah it's worth the look.Keitel's a rather odd choice for such a minor part, ditto Plummer-but alright, that makes up a smallish cast to begin w/.

","I don't think all that much of this, certainly the casting and acting are really good-Buscemi, Madsen, Tierney, Roth, etc-and it Does have that Tarentino attitude to spare-but that only gets you so far.I can't really imagine why you would consider a movie where one character is slowly bleeding to death in the center of the screen for most of it, another has his ear cut off, another does a long drawn out torture scene, and the incessant 'fuck you's' and shootings left right up and down....to be a classic when it really is more of a low budget homage to nasty mob flix from Hong Kong, exploitation of exploitation if you will.Sure, Keitel, Madsen and Buscemi really deliver. But you expect that. I also thought that they did NOTHING in this movie but stand around the warehouse a lot, flash their guns around and spew out 'fuck you' every 4.2 seconds. That got old fast.Tarentino is a grating non-actor who should stay outta his own movies, Tim Roth was miscast, and the dying slowly via gut-shot stuff--that was MSTK3 material.

He's a welterweight, for Pete's sake-and pulls it off!) Sly has never been better than he is here, no doubt about it. I hope they avoid a Rocky VI like the plague, and leave well enough alone.

But we could have done without the Deliverance stuff in the pawn shop, and I think the shootings were rather gratuitous too. The characters spent a lotta time talking about McDonalds in Paris and what, the Brady Bunch? Pop culture references, which suddenly became the rage in Hollywood, which if not handled right will make you sick.I give Tarentino credit for stealing from all the right places, and for putting the stuff together to make for an entertaining film, though it will make you wince or cringe or whatever at times. But it isn't exactly an Oscar caliber film to my thinking, if you want that, go check out Lonestar.*** outta ****, not as bad as it could have been.",Null,0,1,16 October 1999
The Da Vinci Code," Interesting movie, okay but not great.
","This thing goes too long, you wind up wondering just who the redhaired bank guy was working for, and the 'escapes' were really kinda SAD. Slow motion in a truck time-Again! What, time-lapse car chases not good enough for you Gazzo? Ummm...no.The movie itself? Interesting concepts, great scenery, decent cast, bad writing, some miscasting too. What happened to Tom Hanks here? They might as well've hired Michael Keaton or Dan Ayckroyd to play this role. He just contributed Nada to it. The little brunette was cute but you wondered if she knew what was going on, too. Ian McKellan was a hoot, Gandalf again doing his thing. Our albino guy from 'A Beautiful Mind' well, he just sorta shows up and kills people. Seemed to be a nervous wreck. And what was Doc Ock doing in this? His role seems to be cut right down, he's a fine talent but given little to do and winds up being rather shunted aside towards the end too. Ditto Jean Reno. He came off as being a schmuck that turns 'good' late. Hmmmm okay.From this you might think I hated it. No no no no no. I enjoyed the flashbacks to the first Crusade, Isaac Newton's funeral, Constantine, etc. That stuff was all good. I liked watching them shuffle along the consipiracy w/ Kings, scientists and the like all being in on the act. It was kinda cool to try and follow the conspiracy threads too and see which character was really on whose side. It wasn't always easy to tell.Here's the problem. As a longtime Byzantine history nut, I can tell you that the central premise-Constantine waved his magic wand and Voila the Catholic Church buried Magdalene/Mrs Christ into oblivion-that's bogus in the extreme. Constantine Was a Christian for a good chunk of his life. He had no more ability to force church doctrine then than John Paul II could. Buying into such obscure legends ala Mary M being his wife, their kid coming w/ her to France, winding up somehow tracing lineage in an illiterate society for centuries, then marrying into the inbred, short-lived, fueding goober Merovingians--this just doesn't add up. Why not believe St Thomas personally sailed to India and started a church there? Or Andrew to Scotland? Paul to Portugal? What of the Veronoica Cloth? What of the Byzantines and their mountains of relics thru the ages? What of the early church fathers ala Iraneus and Origen who pre-dated Nicea by over 100 years each and clearly wrote of Christ's divinity etc? Selective cherry picking of certain apocrypia of being 'true' and dumping everything else is just as bad, seems to me, as being a fundamentalist and buying into the Bible w/out a shred of modern perspective. It just doesn't wash.I also found the whole 'Templers found 1000 year old relics and got rich that way' to be silly. Really? The First Crusade happened due to the Byzantines losing a Gettysburg like battle in the far eastern range of their Empire to the Seljuks at Manzikert, in 1071. THAT scared the crap outta Europe. THAT is what freed up the church to divert these nobles, knights and petty barons eastwards to chase after land, money, trade rights and of course, salvation. NOT some hair brained 'dig up the tomb of Mary M.' wild good chase.Anyways. I've skipped talking about the movie itself. It does what it sets out to, but then has three endings, goes on a half hour too long, and loses interest on the way. Ron Howard was a director for hire here and while he does what he was hired for, you kinda think Oliver Stone or even Michael Bay(!!) would have been better choices.**1/2 for the flashbacks, scenes set in the Louvre etc. and just because.",6,1,2,3 June 2006
Titanic," Big Sinking Boat
","Big Sinking Boat is a great movie. I saw it 3 days after it came out, and couldn't believe how well it was made; the scenes on the bow(I'm Flying!) as the boat chugs into the sunset probably what helped put the film over for me as much as anything. What puts Titanic up there with the other great epics-Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind, etc. is that Cameron knew, KNEW that to get you hooked, he needed characters people cared about, Felt for, and wanted to see more of.
The movie has heart, excellant performances, the best of FX; it pulls you into its world and doesn't let go until it wants to. Wrap that up with the most haunting theme music this side of Field of dreams....is it any wonder it made so much $$$ in '97-98? A deserved Oscar winner, an old fashioned epic done the right way for once.

Rocky III," Done to a T...
","I always have liked this one too, Eye of the Tiger and all that, this one is fast, edited quickly, has a great training montage, three fights(AND HULK HOGAN for good measure...), Apollo Creed's change over into a good guy was a stroke of genius on Stallone's part to my thinking.(Plus you see Burgess Meredith's Mickey die, that too is a poignant moment...)Mr. T...is great! As Mr. T, of course, who else?? He does a Mike Tyson(years before Iron Mike) type guy to a 'T', very well. They didn't try to do anything much different with Clubber Lang other than making him a bad-ass enemy, and you have to say T delivers.Here the fights are all short, and like the other ones in the first two Rockies-a non-stop parade of haymakers and windmill rights.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Pretty good, somewhat overlong, but fine for what it is.
","Reminded me rather strongly of both 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' and 'Oz', apparently does justice to the popular series of books. Now I have not read them-but the material certainly is familiar looking enough. I found this to be, at least as a film:*too long by about a half-hour or so, it goes on too long. You get to the punchline at the end somewhat later than ya should.*Pretty well acted-Maggie Smith, Harrison, John Hurt and the rest are pros. I liked the kid actors-Harry, Hermione and Beasley-well enough. Esp 'Hermione', she is quite good. They all give to the roles and film what is needed, nothing more, nothing less.*The best parts-the Quidditch(think racketball on broomsticks), the broomflying lessons, the attack of the troll, etc-are nicely done, convincing, fun, scary when they need to be, etc. I thought the Quidditch games served the same function as the Speeder Race in 'Phantom Menace'-lotsa action, lotsa 'Ben Hur' stuff,great f/x involving the hero-it does make you stay glued to the screen.*Some of the stuff was shoe-horned in-esp. the sudden appearences/walk-thrus of John Cleese as a ghost, a Centaur savior(say Wha-?!); they obviously were trying to put in as much of the books as possible-it makes for a fuller 'viewing experience'-but does make you need a scorebook to keep track of who is who.*the Cerebrus/Fluffy character was great.*More Hermione.*Gotta like Robbie Coltrane as the Friendly Giant. He was the best part of the whole show.SPOILER ALERT!!!!
*I thought that having Quirelle turn out as being the villain was strange. They hadda keep Alan Rickman as the baddie instead. Why the buildup otherwise? Rickman was great. The turbaned guy, not so hot. I wasn't all that impressed by the final confrontation too. Something about a two-faced guy, a mirror and a red rock. Yay. The chessmatch was not bad if somewhat slow moving at times.Overall this was  a fun view, needed some trimming that is all. The lead-Potter-was good, by the way. They coulda used him in 'Phantom Menace'.*** outta ****, it's certainly worth yer while, whether you have read the book or not is not matter.",Null,0,0,15 December 2001
The Godfather: Part III," alright
","This was pretty good for what it was, and did well at the box office(66M in 1990-91). I liked the performances for the most part, enjoyed the bow to John Gotti(Joey Zasa?) and the cinematic skill Coppola used throughout.
His kid can't act.Pacino was good, so was Mrs. Rocky(sorry) and Garcia. I can't say that I was impressed with the last half hour though-just WHO killed the Pope, the Italian Mob or Pacino? The dead guy hanging from the bridge, who did him? Why? And where did Garcia go to at the end?Roger Ebert made the observation that many of these scenes were shot from afar, and bore the looks of being over-dubbed in post production: i.e. even Coppola didn't really know 'til afterwards, flipping a coin, more like.But I think they got it right more than wrong, and it is worth watching.*** outta ****",Null,1,2,9 October 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," May Tricks: Yer Loaded-works alright, nothing great.
","I am one who liked the first but didn't see it as being a Classic or anything. Tron meets Terminator, starrying the Bill and Ted guy. Okay. The computers have won and we're all converted into being Ray-o-Vacs. That much I understood.Minor spoilers ahead??In the second, well you have Too much wire-fu, which goes on forever-what was up w/ the 88 Elronds attacking at once? Okay it was a neat trick when George Burns played against himself 19 years ago in O God III, but enough already. We got the point.The freeway chase was like the ones in 'Bad Boys II'-goes on Forever, the stunts and etc are great-but c'mon, less IS more guys. The two albino whackjobs kept reminding me of the white haired hit man in 'Bullitt'. The ninja bike stuff was right outta 'Tron'.Sure it's hyper stylized ala Miami Vice or a Michael Bay flick-black leather this, black shades, wire-fu, etc-but some of it just...doesn't quite work. You can also get lost amongst all these weird character titles-the Merovingian, the Oracle, the Keymaker, the Source, etc. Persephone, etc. Okay guys whatever.I liked it over-all though-they're trying hard, Keanu ain't THAT bad, and you have to applaud the advances in CGI and the like. Too bad there isn't much THERE, ya know? Zion is dull, the infamous Rave scene plays like a bad Lambada out-take, and we really know Anthony Zerbe can do better in his sleep than he did there.  I still haven't figured out What the Source guy was talking about-You have been here 6 times before-say WHAT? and it's best that Larry Fishbourne doesn't have to play the Voice of God too much from here on out.(Oh, as far's the Lord of the Rings flicks being held up as superior to these-well, the source material is that much better for one, and two, let's face it-Sir Petey Jax' stuff is filled w/ weird characters wandering around endlessly chased by badly done Orcs or animotronic rampaging Elms or breakdancing Wizards. You think that's somehow  Lawrence of Arabia or whatever? Sure guys. Gimme a break.

It's a Wonderful Life," Its a wonderful film too
","Like the entries for 'Star Wars', 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'The Third Man', about everything that can be said about this one has been said already. I will say that it's a tremendously affecting film, even after seeing it every year for ages-it still delivers. Watch this one after watching, say, 'You Can't Take it With You' or 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town'-you'll see many of the same faces in the cast, and a similar magic working in them as well.
Personally I have always enjoyed Sheldon Leonard (as the bar keeper) and Sam S. Hinds as the father, among many, many others. Of course, the ending where he gets help from the Halohead, and begs God for his life back, absolutely wrenches your guts to tears every time out; no one could deliver the goods like Capra, Reed and Stewart.

Enemy at the Gates," Pretty good...some flaws.
","I thought of this as being 'Saving Private Ryan East', and in a way, it sure is-esp the first scenes and some of the later combat footage. I also didn't have a problem with it mostly being a 'Cat and Mouse' game of sniper vs Sniper. That was good.  Some spoilers!You hadda like the 'crawling outta the pipes and blinding Person X with the glass shine', scene, albeit a basic Bug Bunny trick. Documentary? I don't think so guys.I doubt you had that many Russian soldiers who looked like Rachel 'Mummy' Weisz either, she stands out as a jewel-box amongst the drudgery and chaos. She was fine, their love-scene tacked on-though I think 'love scene' and 'Rachel Weisz' is something well worth seeing myself.I liked Ed Harris though he had a smallish role, very few lines.
I thought that the hanging scene was forced.I thought that Joseph Fiennes role was not well written either, he went from grunt to bigwig to pal to foe to martyr like that.And the final scenes-where Harris comes out and allows himself to be a sitting duck-HUH? I didn't buy it. I have read the actual accounts of their fatal encounter-it was the Russian shooting at a slight twinkling in the woodwork, ala most of the earlier scenes. The last one was too 'Gunsmoke' for me.But the positives-look, scenery, the uniforms, the opening stuff, the bombing, etc. put this up into the quality end of things. I was not sure how good it would be, it was if anything better than I expected.
I also will plug Bob Hoskins and Ron 'Beast' Perlman too, always good to seem them in a flick, though Hoskins did seem to chew da scenery somewhat.*** outta ****, not a classic but certainly a decent try.",Null,0,0,17 November 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Thin line, what is real, what is not?
","And what is sanity, and what is not?  These are asked of us the audience over and over in this movie. I know it had me going a few times.SPOILERS!!!!!!
For example, his British sounding roomie and her niece, well into the movie, you find out, Don't Exist. Had me going, esp. when you consider his earlier dorm scenes.Ed Harris-did he ever exist, say for at least One or two early missions for the Pentagon? Probably not-he certainly isn't there later on-but as Nash(Crowe)did clearly work for the Defence Dept in some capacity-it does make you wonder.You hadda like his line to the Nobel Prize guy-are you really there?-do you see him?-late in the film. Quite funny, too.End SPOILERS.Performances-Crowe, as good as you could want, Ed Harris trotting out the reliable steely eyed Spook, Plummer, Brettany, all good. Jennifer Connelly-as always skillful, beautiful, vastly underrated, finally has a Big Role in a Big Flick to boost her profile/career. And it's about time. She is very good here, her and Crowe a believable couple coping with a terrible disease.It's hard to watch the shock treatment scenes, and it's sad to realize the guy spent years burrowed inside a wall of Conspiracy which didn't exist outside his own mind.Oscar will be all over this, as it should be. Crowe turns in another magnetic, completely believable Robert Mitchum like performance here, it's his best.***1/2 outta ****, Ron Howard does it again.",Null,0,2,5 January 2002
The Departed," Quite good, too long, fine movie and acting.
","This was a return to the old Marty S. universe of Goodfellahs and Casino, it's in between'em as far's how good it is. I really liked it-Leo, Damon, Jaack, Marky Mark-all good. Sheen and Alec B have smallish roles but are fine too. Boston locales are top-notch, the movie takes the great HK Internal Affairs flick and tosses the Whitey Bulger angle into the mix, complete w/ the FBI informant stuff and corrupt cops aspect. There were only a couple things 'wrong' with it from my point of view.One-it's about 20 minutes or so too long. The whole double-romance between the cop shrink and Damon/Leo is too cute by half(c'mon...it's Hollywood I know but still...), and slows down the pace after a fast first hour or so.Two-You don't wanna see Leo wind up dead. He was the heart of this movie, somehow that whole OK Corral finale at the elevator reminded me of 'Face Off' if anything. Not terribly believable.Three-Marky Mark bagging Matt Damon at the end-I liked it, but that's still sorta too neat. Good movie though pretty much.I do like this movie though, the character actors and the lot are solid.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," I enjoyed it. Like the first one, just bigger.
","You don't need me to give a run-down of the plot, it's just the old Marvin the Martian blowing up the Earth(because it obstructs his view of Venus...) routine. You wanna know-was this movie any good? Was it fun? Yes it was. And yes it was.Sure the humans are 1-dimensional, Sam's family is right outta Family Guy, as well as the jokes(pot brownie/gay dogs/gremlin bots in the house), but you can live with that.Sure the movie has some really idiotic scenes that go nowheres-the cyborg female w/the metal tongue, the college itself presented as a Penthouse Camp on roids, for example--but it IS pretty entertaining and fun despite itself.Best parts: *Three way fight in the forest, Optimus dies.*Whole Jetfire/Yoda character. I had fun w/ that. Nice beard.*Big fight near the pyramids-the construction bots, the big Kat, the cycles racing around, etc. So much to see and be amused by. Very impressive CGI.*Better characterizations of the Robots-Megatron, Wheelie, Jetfire, Starscream, etc.*Megan Fox is just fun to look at.What's not so good? *Hard to tell what you are seeing in the battle scenes, again.*Too busy robot designs, you need to really look again to see what's what, for example in the Fallen's lair on Titan.*Huey and Dewey bot twins are somewhat racial in look/sound, though I found them to be funny, honestly--as did the audience, their designs were...unfortunate, to say the least.Frankly, if you liked the last one, you Should like this, if you like Bay's movies, you should like this one, if you don't either-stay far away.

I think we've Seen this idiotic Raptors chasing the heroes in the cellar scenario More than enough, Steve, Okay?? Leave that one by the side of the freakin' road next time you have it run by ya in scripting sessions. Gag.Up until then, it's pretty good-whole build up to the tripod bursting outta the ground in Bayonne, terror and destruction everywheres, Cruise on the run w/ his family, etc, heck even the ferry scene and the battle on the other side of the river, were all pretty decent.I could do w/out the freaking forcefields that the squids had though, gimme a break. That's just plain old Lazy Writing, and it's been done to death. The whole business in the 'snack baskets' w/ Cruise, the grenades, etc--just two of them and the whole bloody Tripod goes Blooey, tells me Ebert is right-those things are just Tinker toys and not very tough ones at that.What was it that the Natl Guard or whatever used to bring down that one in Boston--three RPG's or Bazookas or whatever? Good lord. That's like taking down an Abrams w/ a Roman Candle, you know? Hate to think what this alleged superior race would have done vs Nukes.....As for the performances etc--Cruise was Cruise, nothing more or less. Fanning is Jodi Foster, less is more though. The rebellious son was a pain. You wince when you see him walk outta the house in Boston at the end--what?! how did he get away alive?? How did they get from NewBurgh or whatever to Boston w/out being nailed by the Squids? How did that part of Boston not get fricasseed? No nukes?! Tim Robbins was painful to watch. Good actor, but this part was Not meant for him. Steve Buscemi, Yes, that would have worked. The ET's playing w/ the Schwinn and what not went on far too long, they looked way too much like the greys in the X-files/ID4, and the whole 1953 TV camera/Boa constrictor probe thingie...that was a blatant tribute to the old Gene Berry flick, but c'mon. It was silly.Nice to See Berry and Robinson at the end too, but--at least give them a line or two? Let Gene say to the camera, after seeing it mentioned on CNN--I've seen this before.....woulda worked.The other holes-the van working, the jet crashing on their block, etc--that's okay if you just consider it B-movie terrain.

James Woods definately makes the show work, but I have to admit admiring the animation, Danny DeVito and the fight with the Titans. Nothing will top what goes down with the Hydra however.Think of this as a sequel to Aladdin in ways, same kinda outlook, same kinda sensibility.

I also thought that the little montage of Mannfred's parent's(cave drawings come to life) were done well too.As for the messages-'Non-trad families are okay too-', people can work together, etc.-well, all are pretty obvious and all that-but it's not hammered home ala Disney, and you also don't have anyone breaking out into song, either.See it for the Mammoth and the squirrel, though the Sloth is fun too.

I didn't think they brought out enough of the actual rape case early enough. Yes I know it was from the kids point of view, but still...Minor point as I said.

Myself I find their performances to be amateurish and this thing, truly, is on a par with 'Twistin' USA' and yer average 'Monkees' episode, save that the Monkees could sing better than the Beatles could act, which is saying something right there, now isn't it?I know this is a Pythonish excursion and a tribute to swinging London, etc etc yak yak, but that means little to myself-as a flick it is OK but running against even 'King Creole'-I say take Creole and hold the limeys.*** outta ****, because I'm being NICE.",Null,0,10,19 January 2001

","Uhhh, this one was kinda like watching Die Hard II but with a Steven Segal type on board with a planeload of whackjobs instead of Willis. I liked it, in an A-Team with dead bodies, more explosions and bigger budget kind of way-but its nothing special. Sure, Malkovich, Cage, Rhames and Buscemi are all big name actors, and yeah, some of them rise to the occasion. For me, it was entertaining enough, but not worth trying to pin down for its loopholes or unrealistic moments. This is a flight of fantasy, pure and simple. Bruckheimer and Cage had done it before-better I might add-in the Rock just a year before, and it shows.(I Do throw in a couple Spoilers about a Bad Guy at the End, too, warning!!!!)I got a kick outta seeing the Irish Trek guy as a DEA slug, and then Reverand Alden from Little House on the Prairie sharing space under a truck with Nick Cage. Cusack was pretty good too.Buscemi's characeter was under-written, I preferred him as Rockhound in Armageddon myself, but always like seeing him of course. Guys like David Chappelle and the big Indian there were good in their parts, stereotyped as they were, ditto the mangy looking Pilot. All of them fine character actors.Over all, you have to give it some stars for panache and ooomph, esp the overkill way they have of killing off Malkovich, what with the pile driver, fire truck and what-not. They really wanted us to get the point-the guy is a bastard and is quite dead at the end, no doubt.Cage's southern accent sucked and you really hadda wonder Why they even bothered, but overall he was okay.I give it **1/2 outta ****, pretty good effort for what it is.",7,0,0,27 February 2000
The Green Mile," Goes the extra mile, and then some...
","I really liked this. Some parts are Very hard to si through, especially the Second Execution scene. Donno if we need Three of these in the one flick, but there ya go, it IS set on Death row, the director has a point to get across, and it is Hollywood after all.It reminded  me a little of Phenomenon, if you took the Travolta character's abilities and put'em into use by the big black guy from Armageddon, you'd have it. There was a lotta heart in Duncan's performance, I was struck by how strong a presence he has, and how moving the healing scene outside the prison is as well.Hanks, Morse, and DeMunn are all pros, I always like seeing Morse esp. in whatever he's in. Very reliable. It's interesting to see how much work Stretch Armstrong is post-Babe, here he gives a fine turn as the warden.I thought that Sam Rockwell as the psycho chewed the scenery a bit much, but enjoyed seeing babyFace there Percy. I was shocked that he is almost 40 in the film, and played one of the psycho killers in 'A Time to Kill'. Quite a stretch.Bonnie Hunt and the sickly Warden's wife both turn in fine performances, and both are also aged alot more by makeup than they really are, esp Hunt, who is two years older than me.There are a couple things wrong-it is too long, I think that the middle execution scene was Not really necessary; and I thought that the finale with the old guy(Dabs Greer, who played the preacher on Little House all those years)narrating his life's turn was a little stretched out.But overall, moving, insightful, unique, well-made, hard to sit through a couple places.Kudos also to Mike Jeter and the Mouse too.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Pretty good-not great but a worthy finale to series.
","I enjoyed this quite a lot. Sure you have the bugaboos from the first two prequel movies--some bad stretches of dull talky scenes, klunky dialog and acting that makes you roll your eyes. But this time-King Jorge Lucas managed to avoid letting that overwhelm the rest of the film and thus we got a good, bona fide decent movie Star Wars movie here.Ian McDiarmid as the Evil Emperor is very good. So is Ewan MacGregor as Kenobi. I have felt that if Lucas could have coaxed similar performances from either Portman or Jackson the prequels would have been that much better, but oh well....Christensen seems to be a block of wood and has an odd personality for Vader, ya know? Petulant and comes off as a blue blooded snotty youth more than anything else. Somehow or other though you buy into his transformation into Darth Vader, especially as he's so easily maneuvered by Palpatine.Great scenes here-the 'Order 66' sequences in their Temple, the jedis being fragged all over, the younglings included, the Wookie planet, the lizard, the volcano duel....over and over. You wanna see More if anything of these things, not less.I liked the great vaunted Duel between Kenobi and Vader too, it was well handled and the magma pit from hell far out-did anything we had imagined back in the day.Kudos to Lucas for getting the plot working in synch w/ the rest of the film--everyone seemed to care about what they were doing here, and it does show.

You cannot go wrong w/ Jami Foxx here--it's almost as if he is channeling The Genius throughout this. Amazing. You almost believe you are seeing the real thing.I enjoyed the musical numbers, appreciated the brutal honest blunt depiction of his heroin use, and the fact that Brother Ray certainly Did screw around his fair share. Regina King's character prob. stood in for many more like her I think.I would have liked more of his post-mid 60's career shown, at least hinted at some; and it's true that this is a pretty routine biopic plot. As in all movies, it's not the formula its what you do w/ it--and I think they did very well here.Here is hoping Foxx gets his Oscar(TM) and they keep on playing Ray's music.*** outta ****",7,3,5,12 February 2005

Sherlock Holmes," Very enjoyable, quite a Bruckheimerish treatment of Sherlock.
","Fine performances by Downey Jr. as Holmes and Law as Watson, Macadams as the lady friend/thief working both sides of the street is okay too. Enjoyed the action (esp. the exploding barrels/slaughter-house locales), the CGI backdrops for London Bridge etc, and the filming in Prague added to the atmosphere.Much of the plot is nonsense involving the Illuminati, fake resurrections, Guy Fawkes plot by way of Cyanide and the like. I liked Lestrade by the way. Pretty funny way of playing him.Some of the movies stylistic touches-inter-cutting of images/fast edits etc/the odd instant flashback-got old in a hurry, but you can live w/ it. The choices they made in how Holmes was played-his computerlike mind, his odd attachment to his bow, his pipe, Watson and his opium-are shown clearly but in new ways. Downey makes this one go, as is always the case of late.By all means lets have another couple--this is a fun flick and worth seeing.*** outta ****",7,0,2,16 January 2010
The Good Shepherd," Pretty decent movie of CIA history.
","I agree with the complaints here to a point on: slowness, lack of action, murky plot lines, over-length. But I also enjoyed the fact that DeNiro tried something different-character sketch, history, multi flashbacks-these certainly were worthy of wading through.Clearly Damon was Lansdale or Angleton. Clearly Hurt was Dulles. I liked that much, and the obvious nods to the Kennedys etc. as well-pretty good.The Skull and Bones are the Illuminati cliché is kinda tired, if anything I think they might want to avoid it. All that was left out was the Roswell '47 landing and perhaps something about Nazi artifacts...anyways I digress.Damon was well-cast as a cypher, ice-man who did his job no matter what. Joli always looks semi-anorexic to me. They also were really TOO old to be playing 20 year olds at the start, and hard to buy into the aging. Jolie and Damon as Mom and Dad just...kinda doesn't ring true, ya know? And that kid of theirs was straight outta 'AI' and looked a lot closer to being Damon's nephew or youngest brother, to be honest. This wasn't the greatest of casting choices there, to be honest.I liked Deniro as Bill Donovan, Pesci as Trafficante(or whomever), Hutton as Richard Helms. These were pretty identifiable types. The slagging of locusts into the coffee crop-well that could have been Guatamala or Venezuela or lord knows where. They missed an opportunity though-wasn't 'The Belgian Congo'/Leopoldville' where in '61 the CIA knocked off Patrice Lamumba who'd been elected as a marxist? Really nasty deal went on down there. And there's nary a blip about this. What was the kid doing there in the first place? The story telling here got too jumpy-you don't quite know what to make of their doings.It's worth watching--just see it as a character sketch instead of a real history and you might like it more. Deniro could have trimmed 20 mins off though easily.***",7,5,7,20 January 2007
The Terminal," zzzzzzzzz this thing DRAGS.
","Okay, the first 45 minutes are fine, showing Hanks adapting to life in the JFK terminal, where his world and existence is established--hey he figured out the quarters!--his cronies in the airport service depts, etc, all well and good. We always know what we will get w/ Hanks, a committed, believable performance, here he does the Gump/Little Tramp/Benny Hill act to a 'T'. Not a problem there.Some spoilers below am sure!!It's only later on that you get to watching your watch...tick...okay he's back to the INS chick w/ the Cerano routine for the 44th time....now he's eating more ketchup and crackers....now he's a carpenter at 19 an hour in the terminal....now he's gotten a hottie stewardess -Zeta Jones-to fall for him....now here's Stanley Tucci being Snidely Whiplash again....etc etc.The contrivances just Don't work. I didn't buy for a minute that this guy would be stuck there for 9 months, I didn't buy for a minute that Zeta Jones would want anything to do w/ him, I didn't buy for a minute that he couldn't get a lawyer or help or escape or whatever. I am sorry but it's true. You have to establish the fantasy world and make it believable on its own terms and here Speilberg just DOESN'T do that.I was not thrilled by the whole autograph seeker reason for his being here either, nor for his failing to get the gal at the end. C'mon Steve ya gotta be better than this. This was an autopilot flick, harmless and well acted but so unrealistic as to stretch even my rather open mind. And that is bad.**1/2 for Hanks and the little Indian guys' twirling plates routine.",Null,1,2,26 June 2004
Platoon," Saving Private Sheen....
","This one was a great film both in its day and in the present too. Great tension between Berenger and Dafoe, chaotic, brutal battle scenes, stirring music, realistic combat footage and drug use, moods, reactions of the fighting men too. Stone was there, this bears the stamp of authenticity. Yeah the Berenger/Dafoe conflict is kinda forced; sure Sheen is hardly the best actor to be at the center of such an important film, and yeah, I know about the complaints of racism on Stone's parts-black soldiers as cowardly addicts, etc.-but sod it, these things did happen and do happen.As for the Private Ryan comparison, well-Private Ryan was made for a much bigger budget, it was done on a bigger scale by a very different director in a different era. I believed what happened in Platoon more so than in Ryan, save for the landing/last battle; Speilberg's story arc is just too...I donno, outta an episode of 'Combat' while 'Platoon' strove for something greater. I think Stone gets at the heart of the regular grunts better than Spielberg did. Remember, Stevie boy got a college deferment to stay outta 'Nam while Stone was right in the thick of the rice paddies. That in itself oughta supply all the backing you need for my thinking.I am def. giving this one **** outta ****. 'Bout time.",Null,0,0,12 August 2000
Paths of Glory," Terrific, gut wrenching stuff
","This is what Saving Private Ryan tried to be but wasn't. Terrific acting, believable scenes of trench warfare, idiots for Generals, sad ending-a film that stands out as one of the 3 or 4 greatest war films of all time. Having Kirk Douglas and Ralph Meeker round to push it along doesn't hurt; somehow I always forget that Kubrick directed this - truly a great achievement by all.**** outta ****.",Null,0,0,21 October 1999
Blow," Fine Goodfellas type of movie....kinda
","I enjoyed this more the second time through. Depp gives another very good 'immersive' performance (in the words of another poster here, yes....)-kind of the flip side of Donnie Brasco, if you like.Spoilers below am sure!Certainly the Goodfellas nods are there-Ray Liotta, a very Lorraine Bracco-like performance/casting of Rachel Griffiths, the baddie narrating things, years going by, etc. The whole bit.I appreciated the fact that they didn't glamorize this much-he gets busted 3-4 times, his mom throws him into jail, his mother is a shrew, his 'friends' are addicted crooks who stab him in the back, etc. Nothing good about either doing coke or selling it or being tossed into the fed pen for it.Nice job by 'Tuna', 'Pablo Escobar'(he was in Three Kings! Always plays someone like an arab or hispanic but is really Maori-go figger!) and Pee Wee Herman, playing himself I suppose this time around? I didn't like Pauline Cruze there, she has never attracted me and her performance was...grating to say the least.Sad ending too.*** outta ****",Null,1,2,7 July 2004
The Iron Giant," This was great
","You will like this one, I knew it would be good but was surprised at just to what a high level they have raised the stakes in animation with Iron Giant. Sure it borrows from ET a good deal, but then that borrowed from Lassie and a hundred other Boy and his Dog stories before it, too.I was knocked out by the animation, characters(Beatnik Man was good-Connick was right on the beam), so was the kid, the govt baddie and Jennifer Aniston. Thought that they modelled her character's looks after her a little, and that helped.They got the '50s look to it right, the music, cold war era paranoia, Maypo ads and what not. I felt that they put a lotta heart into it, and enjoyed the scenes with the boy explaining a soul to the Iron Giant on the starry rooftip quite alot.So it used a little Christian symbolism and themes, so what? A huge chunk of the country is exactly that-and will agree with what is being said.Being from Maine orig, I got a kick outta them setting it in my state, too.I am sorry Warner's kinda threw this out there without pushing it the way they oughta, it is a classic and will be around for some time to come I think.***1/2, very very good, right there with Tarzan and Beauty and the Beast.",Null,1,1,13 May 2000
Shrek," It's not easy Venting Spleen....
","At least for Herr Katzenberger, Dreamworks/ex Disney head honcho, piling onto some of his own works there-Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, etc with a ton of parody and satire all throughout the flick. Most of it works, some of it, well-doesn't. When they try and get all serious towards the end here, with a 'secret character twist' you can see coming 40 miles away-it's a case of wanting to have yer cake and eat it too, seems to me. Blazing Saddles funny this ain't.That said, I liked the voices, the action(gotta like the dragon fight), though Eddie Murphy does get tiring as the yakky donkey after awhile. Still it was pretty involving and funny throughout, Myers as Shrek does a good job too.Check it out, not better than 'Bugs Life' or 'Aladdin', but hardly inferior either.*** outta **** or so, kinda good.",Null,0,0,3 June 2001
Any Given Sunday," Interesting, good-bad.
","I have a really Mixed viewpoint on this flick, overall I liked it but...there are somethings that weren't that good.Some SPOILERS POSSIBLE BELOW!!Good points: The football action, not badly choreographed, hard hitting, heck they even called back a possible game winning TD due to Holding! Shock! Yes it DOES happen! A Hollywood sports flick that shows some penalties!Famous NFL faces-Dick Butkus, Barry Switzer, Jim Brown and Johnny Unitas(I missed him first time through), and of course L.T. He was really good, by the way. I liked that.Stone copping the John Elway 'Somersault-run' from the Broncs-Packers BlooperBowl 3 years ago. Quaid kinda was playing Elway/Marino wasn't he? That was fun to see.L.T's performance. One of the best jock-acting jobs I've ever seen. He deserves to be given his dues for that too. And hey, they called him 'Shark'-yup he always reminded me of one, to be honest.Not-so-Great stuff:Lousy team Uni's and Names. I mean-the Emperors? the Crusaders?? the Knights?? Rhinos I could see. And what was up with the colors? It was like watching bad USFL/CFL/XFL games-Orange and red and brown? You gotta be kidding me.James Woods role-I like him alot-but what was he given to work with here? They didn't even bother to keep him round long enough to matter-was his role cut down in editing or what?Pacino as coach actually was OK-perf. especially. But no he didn't exactly remind me of Tom Landry or Madden, sure.Can do without the pointless Heston cameos-I am a fan but what was the point of Ben-Hur footage and all that?? Give him more to do or don't bother.Diaz and Lauren Holly were fine-but they really oughta try eating more than once a day. LL Cool J did a pretty decent job as Terrell Davis but struck me as being too hefty, not as in like Jerome Bettis hefty but Kirby Puckett Hefty. Not a running back guys.Stone's Cossell bit was fun actually, I liked it, kidding himself somewhat. I think he just wanted to put out a fun, non-60's oriented flick and that is what he did. We coulda done without the eyeball on the ground or all that puking though, seems to me. The players milieu of broads, booze, coke and stuff was actually on target.I didn't quite buy Jami Foxx's making the cover of virtually every magazine in the land AND being on a Roy Firestone-like ESPN show AND doing Mike Jordan levels of ads simply after coming in and winning 2 games like that late in the season. Just Doesn't happen. Oh well.Overall a pretty good effort, worthwhile, not a documentary.**1/2 outta ****",Null,0,0,11 March 2001
Iron Man," It's good. Go see it.
","I don't see anything really wrong with this movie, save for a somewhat rushed final act. Okay there's this.SPOILER!Villain Jeff Bridges is shown having trouble getting his Bigger Iron Man thingie buildt-traditional yelling at the guys in the white coats stuff-but sure enough, there he is, driving Robocop II around, flying it around like a Jet fighters, using it's weapons etc-almost as if he were testing out a Minivan. I'm not so sure about that instantaneous learning curve, lemme put it that way....But the rest-the stuff showing Downey as Iron Man, Downey as the Hugh Hefner/boozy Howard Hughes cross, the captivity, the interplay w/ Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow-that's all aces. I loved Jarvis. I really liked all the flight scenes and his taking out the Taliban/Mandarin guys in Afghanistan.Sure it DOES follow a traditional Origin storyline, and sure you want More, if anything-but-face it, this is what you want in a comicbook hero film.***1/2 very good.",8,1,3,4 May 2008
The Emperor's New Groove," Disney's tongue in cheek in spades....
","This is straight outta 'Hercules' and 'Aladdin', but just without the underpinnings which made the Bloo Genie such a smash in '92. It's closer to 'Hercules', a kinda Looney Toons romp without much attention being paid to trad. Disney stuff like songs, cutie animal sidekicks, etc. Nothing particularily dramatic here-the llama/Spade character heads back to his city with a Little John type guy to try and get his throne back from Evil Witchwoman Eartha Kitt. Things like Spade breaking into the narration, characters cutting to the chase, the whole extended romp through the Jungle, or in the canyons or the restaurant episode-are quite funny. You don't necessarily remember much after watching it; and there's nothing more to be learned from this any than you would from an old Tex Avery Droopy short.  Have a good time and don't sweat the details that much.*** outta ****, maybe rated a wee bit too high, but what the heck, it's alotta fun and worth the time.",Null,0,0,15 October 2001
Ben-Hur," It's great. It holds up for the most part. Worthy of it's rep.
","I was quite impressed. You have all the typical Epic flick cliches there-3-4 hour length, guys like Jack Hawkins in supporting roles, big time historical battles(this time at sea), and of course some over-arching theme-Christ-running throughout. Quite good all in all.Heston was Fine as Judah. Name me someone better from that time-Mitchum? Wayne? Hudson? Heck I saw a screen test of Cesare Danova (w/ LESLIE NIELSON!!) in the two lead roles tacked on at the end-it goes to show ya just how good and commanding a presence Heston had in '59. Those guys just didn't come close.Sure some of this is dated-it's pacing does flag in the domestic moments, there is one too many trips to the leper colony, and just who was the silent bald guy, George the Animal Steele? He just kinda lurks around like 'Oddjob' in Goldfinger, darned if I know....I was also surprised that the chariot race was Not the finale, instead you have Christ, the healings and etc at the end. But ya know what-that is Good. It follows the arc of the storyline-Christ gives Ben Hur water near the beginning, and when Christ needs it at the end, Ben Hur returns the favor. Somehow I found this if anything to be quite fitting indeed. Today's flix-ala Gladiator-woulda just finished with the Chariot Race. No bravery.I saw this line in a prior review here-' Just like the Roman Empire: destroyed by Christianity'.  That is Kookoo in the extreme, both in terms of the movie AND history. This movie works Because there is more to it than just a chariot race and a revenge plot. And as far's Rome falling due to Christianity-that is bad history put out by Enlightenment historians ala Gibbons who had an axe to grind with Christianity and didn't mind monkeying with the facts. If Christianity caused the fall of Rome-then please explain why the Byzantine Empire-it's Eastern Half-was still a grade A superpower in the 1000's. As Theocratic a state as you will ever see.Right. You can't.Anyways-Great epic, flick, very much worth yer time.**** outta ****",Null,7,14,2 September 2002
Bull Durham," Pretty good, somewhat over-rated.
","I donno, I've seen this one a couple times on TV here and there, but honestly had never sat thru the whole thing before start to finish. For five bucks, you can pick this up at Wal-mart, so-being the baseball junkie I am, why not? I really love Field of Dreams and the Natural. I like 8 Men Out and thought Major League was a hoot, the Rookie was better than it had a right to be. This--well okay it's on the same level of enjoyment for me as 8 Men Out and Major League. Anyone putting it over Field of Dreams, say-well you aren't looking at it same was I am.What was good-Tim Robbins played a clueless goober rather well. They nailed the whole drudgery of playing minor league ball, partying, living on the road and being a jock as good as you could want.Costner I thought was a little flat, there's always been so much buzz about this being so realistic-but I donno, any guy who belts 247 homers in the minors from behind the plate is going to be in the majors this day and age. Even guys like Kelly Shoppach and Kevin Cash spend more than 21 games up 'in the Show', and you aren't going to keep a guy that hits like Lance Parrish in A ball forever. C'mon.Anyways. Robbins was too old to play the 23 year old phenom(he was 30 or so), Sarandon just irritated me to no end, used up is a way I would describe her, and was it me or did they NEVER show anyone else in the team's pitching rotation? Relievers? other starters? what Costner was the only guy who knew about throwing a slider or curve occasionally? What gives-? It's good intentioned, the bathtub/candles/garters scnenes were hot, and yes it rings true to life for the most part. It's also really dated(dig those Miami Vice duds on Robbins!), and it made me wanna break out the Rookie just because by the end of it.**1/2 or so outta ****. *meh*",6,4,8,13 September 2008
Signs," It's great. Mix 'War of the Worlds' w/ 'Field of Dreams'
","...And you got it, pretty much. Spoilers below!!!!!As always, Shymalion leaves us with a heartfelt, longish, detailed, intelligent flick, heavy on the spiritual underpinnings. I really enjoyed the 'Small farmer caught up in an Alien Invasion' angle, the pastoral slant added something to this whole thing.Mel Gibson as always was his convincing self, playing a character in his craggy believable way. I kinda wonder if he was under-written some, certainly the guy in 'Soldier's Story' had more to say about the world around him than Father Graham. Oh well.Joaquin Phoenix-very good. Grabs the 'Wonderboy bat'(from the Natural) inside the Spiritual Cornfield(from Field of Dreams) and takes out the Alien Boogler(who looks like the Creature from the Black Lagoon) towards the end. Gibson and him as brothers-well, okay, the age gap is a leap.....Loved the kids' performances, Caulkins are prodigies under 12 and the little girl, dead on. Touches such as the little tinfoil hats, the half-full water glasses, you just can't get better than that.It was interesting to see the coverage of the Aliens landing, compare it to say 'ID4' or 'Men in Black'. Somewhat sensational but not over-done.
I kept on thinking of 'Twilight Zone' and 'X-files', though this does have an element of 'Scooby Doo' too-locked closets, monsters in darkened halls, the beast in the corn lurking round. All nicely done. Symalion is big, big big on atmosphere, tone, mood. Here it's milked rather nicely.I thought his cameo wasn't bad either, his acting is so-so, but hey, it does work.By all means, do catch this, the audience I saw it with was really into it.*** outta ****",7,0,2,3 August 2002

So why the heck should anyone give a rats behind about who killed who and who the 'real killer' was afterwards? I agree. It's not worth yer attention after you find out they just don't exist.Someone should do a 'Phantom Edit' of this thing and get ridda that whole sequence.

Live Free or Die Hard," Pretty good, as good as #3 at least in series.
","I enjoyed this. Bruce was back-though you could say stuff like '16 Blocks' were Die Hard-lite installments, still-this is the official return of John McLane. I'm impressed, for the most part. Heck the side-kick isn't that irritating, Mac ads and all, the James Bond-ish plot line at least plays out like 'Enemy of State'-too souped up it's own good but believable on it's own terms, plus all the action you could ask for.I think that they did this at least Somewhat tongue in cheek-that whole cop-car taking out the copter bit, then Bruce surfing on the jet there-c'mon you Hadda know that this was over-the-top from the get-go. It was fun the whole way thru. Plus you gotta like the fact that McLane is a stunt-driver/Nascar quality racer in whatever he commandeers-a PeterBilt or a cop-car or whatever. Plus he flies a copter-where did THAT come from-? Nice to see the usual spate of familiar faces-Cliff Curtis, the guy who played 'Bobby Kennedy' in 'Rat-Pack', the white-haired mission control guy from Armageddon, etc. along for the ride. Director Wiseman seems to have learned from equal parts Michael Bay and Tony Scott, but at least he does pull the camera back and allow you to see what is going on clearly, something both of those two forget more than you'd like.Couple things that don't work so well-well Kevin Smith really shouldn't try to act, McLane has gotta be related to Wile Coyote in the durability dept., and face it-no one is watching is for a documentary on espionage or cyber-terrorism.Oh and the baddie-Tim Olyphant-wasn't all that great, your generic white collar sleaze I guess.

You gotta root for her.Lotsa nods to the fans-'Hank McCoy' on TV, files mentioning Sentinels, a Phoenix image in the water at the end, etc. All that. Plus Iceman too.

I kinda thought it would be alright, the premise was interesting and I always like Bruce Willis, but somehow this wound up as the Stealth movie, slipped in under the publics door without a ton of hype ala Phantom Menace or the Blair Witch thingie. I saw it 3 weeks into its run, the theatre here was jammed with folks coming in 15 minutes late; and we all sat spellbound through the whole thing.The kid deserves an Oscar. Willis was fine and could get a nod though no one knows.  Haunting, taut atmosphere throughout, the supporting roles done by Olivia Williams and Toni Collette flawless. I agree that the movie drags some; but that is part of its charms-you are drawn into the characters' experiences and willingly sit there, waiting for the punchline...What a punchline it is. I didn't see it coming; don't think many round me did either. Makes sense Now that I have seen it-but at the time...couldn't believe it. Terrific twist! The harrowing scene inside the closet, the moving sequence at the Wake...you have to see them.

I have zero problem with it for the most part.Where it started to grate was about when they wound up in England, you have them going thru the assassination routine for the 5th time, and by then we've seen it all--the bombs, the set up, the trip, the contacts with our mysterious frenchies, etc.--and you want to see it drawn to a conclusion somwheres.You don't get that. You don't have the usual finale/shootout at the head baddie's HQ, though they do raid it--you have a strange drawn out last 40 minutes where this thing looked like it was going to end 3-4 times.Okay he's back with the wife...Now it will end...Okay he's lost another cohort...now it will end...Okay he's back in Israel...this it? Nope....There is only one really Stupid scene-he's doing his wife, and he keeps on flashing back (for the 8th time now...) to the Munich Massacre.

Add in the John Woo type choreography and flowing robes bits, and ya got it.Excellent effects, good acting; fine way of pushing our buttons of paranoia about machines, technology, the future, our existence, and Who is Really Behind the Curtain?But I sat through and just kinda shrugged. It isn't anything that I haven't seen before in other places. And Try as I might, and actually kinda Liking Keanu...you Still have to remember, the lead guy's pet phrase claim to fame is?: Whoa...Kinda hard on the credibility, you know?And frankly have gotten sick of the oodles and oodles of post Apocalypic fiction that has been flung our way past 30 years or so.

That is not a bad thing, mind-loved Lee's good stuff and Face-Off, so....throw in the Machines-get-smart-and- takeover bit from Terminator(plus countless other Sci-fi stories)and you have this.Keanu Reaves is Keanu Reaves, same guy as he ever was in the Bill and Ted films, Point Break, Speed and so forth. Every once in a while, ala Patrick Swayze or Kurt Russell, he burbles up to the surface with a new hit. I think he was okay for what he was supposed to do. Loved having(SPOILER ALERT!!) Guido the Killer Pimp from 'Risky Business' to the obligatory Turncoat move here too. And kudos to the guys who cast 'Trinity', this gal was right there with 'Vasquez' in Aliens. Very nice. You gotta like a film that takes the 'Men in Black' stereo-type and makes them your bad guys, mixing them in with the T-1000 liquid metal guy in Terminator II. Quite good. Very stylish, violent, interesting nod to 'War of the Worlds'-having tentacled squids keeping us penned up as food or fuel or whatever too. I think a sequel would be fun and look forward to it.

The cast, crew and reviews were all top notch; having not seen Goodfellas I basically came into this as a bit of a newbie....Here's what I think:Love the acting, esp. DeNiro and Pesci, though they've both done this same thing before, and better. The narrative, the camera work, first 45 mins of this are great, and if that could have been sustained for the entire film, this could have won the Oscar.  Instead it desolves into a Vegas based Godfather knock off.Now, I don't mind some film violence; and expected it big time with these guys. But WHY the baseball bats in the cornfield? Why the Pesci Vice bit? Did we have to see the old gal get shot 3 times in the head up close like that? I think one of those scenes was enough; but having all three...overkill. There's some terrific supporting jobs here: Don Rickles, Alan King, Sharon Stone turns in one too. James Woods was fine. But when you get to the end, all you can remember is 'Batter up!'

If there is anything wrong, well-a couple things: one the flick is a little Too long, and you don't get to see Pacino and DeNiro onscreen together enough.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Yowsah!!!
","This is a very great film, of the 4 that have been made, this one is the one that acts as a self-contained unit the best; you don't need to see the others to know what is going on, and to appreciate the experience. I saw it back in '77 when I was 11, loved it then and still do now.To my thinking the acting is fine for what it is, though you can see that both Hamill and Fisher are rookies, sod it-they get the job done well. This was a Buck Rogers/Western update, not Casablanca, after all.Lucas does a marvelous job soaking us inside this films world, the dunes of Tatooine, the grease and dents of the droids and machines, the rattley ships and the Imperial Perfectoes...letting us know that real people use these things, made them and repair them.(Unlike, say, in Star Trek where everything works perfectly.....how antiseptic can you get?!)The attacks on the Big Castle (and that is what the Death Star is, of course...)first by our entrapped heroes and then by the Rebel force are handled perfectly; with derring do and panache. Lucas spent 10M(today's equivalent about 30M) on this movie, and every cent shoes through nicely. And he obviously loved what he was doing, treating the genres he cribbed so well with tons of respect. That is what helps make the thing work even now, why it made 140M on its re-release in early '97, and why it is easily one of the top 10 films of all time.People go to see films to be entertained; the great director Howard Hawks(Red River, the Big Sleep, Rio Bravo, etc. etc.) said that a great film has 'Three Great scenes, with no bad scenes in between them'--and he wasn't kidding. Those films didn't and neither does this one.**** outta ****, of course. Easily the best of the series, though all 4 are fine.",Null,0,0,24 September 1999

The Thin Red Line," Surreal World
","Yeah I saw this one, back in January-and must say that I liked it quite a bit-especially two parts. The long march up the hills, in the foliage and greenery, where the fighting is sudden, sharp and savage. I think this is as good as any of the 'Private Ryan' sequences, save for the opening Landing stuff we all know is a classic. And the attack through the Japanese camp is well handled too. Nolte and Cusack do well with their roles.But I had trouble sorting out some of the guys-Chaplin and the one who gets the 'Dear John Letter', among a couple others. Malick spent too much time with the Philosophic nattering and scenic shots-some of which were great but went a Lonnnng way by hour #3. The movie could use better focus and spent more time on the guys who went up the hill, Woody Harrelson and Cusack and co. It's just something that I found confusing as watching this, and wished they'd fixed before releasing it.But still, it is quite a film, Malick was nominated for best Director and the movie for Best Film. While I can't rate it over Ryan because the way it loses focus, neither am I slamming it-I enjoyed Thin Red Line, and agree with some of the others here-it has a Kubrick feel to it, doesn't it?Here's my rating-*** outta ****, good stuff over all.",Null,0,0,7 November 1999

Can't wait to you tell us that Jessica Alba deserves a supporting Oscar nomination for her role, Chiklis should chuck being the Shield due to his great perf. as Ben Grimm, and that this rewrote the book on action movies. GACK.I can't imagine anyone being swayed to see this just from gobs of gushy planted 'reviews' on IMDb. It's not like we're talking a Lawrence of Arabia or whatever, this is a Comic book flick about the FF.

The bridge and the sparrow question? And of course-they ate Sir Robin's minstrels-and there was Much rejoicing(YAY!)...This is a great farce, rather crap ending but all the rest is top notch; unplotted plot allows the Python boys to do what they did best, make us laugh very, very hard.I remember getting absolutely worn out seeing this for the first couple of times.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Yowsah yowsah!
","This is really good, not better or as good as the first one, I might add, but it certainly more than stands up on its own. It is fast moving, better acted(esp. by Hamill/Fisher) and tautly edited. We get to see as much of Vader as we ever need to, and he is brought off brilliantly. Love the Cloud city, the Asteroid fight/flight/chase, the snow battle. You can see that they went for a real edge of the seat type of pacing here, and it works to the films betterment. Overall, very good.What not too like:the Yoda stuff drags at times, but when he lifts the X-wing outta the muck, and when Luke 'meets Daddy' in the cave, those scenes kick. I can't say that Lando is much of a character(kinda flat) and I felt that Threepio was told to shut up about 5 times too often...Minor quibbling.By all means, get it, see it, enjoy it; it is a great film and the second best in the run.***1/2 outta **** stars.",Null,0,0,24 September 1999

","This movie was the biggest film of '92, and it's easy to see why-a lotta fun, as a terrific Robin Williams performance carries it to heights it otherwise would not have gone to. Great animation, fine songs, a decent plot--what is there not to like? I will admit some of the Arab characters seemed to be stereotyped-but no more so than in Mulan or Tarzan or whatever; animation seems to stereotype Everything.A great movie, ***1/2 outta ****, a fave then and now.",Null,39,48,16 October 1999
Sin City," Pretty good, Dick Tracy on Roids if you like......
","......but they DO overkill on the violence. I am always rather suspicious whenever I see the Harry Knowles fanboys going KooKoo over something like this, you just Know it's something that generally was only seen inside the covers of 'Heavy Metal' or in a bad Quiet Riot video from 20 years ago.What's good: Fine turns by Willis, Mickey Roarke, Del Toro. Great atmosphere. Having not read the comics I'm going to assume that this was as faithful to 'co-director' Frank Miller's originals as humanly possible. Stunts, action, cool retro cars, they're in there.What's not so good? You don't Need to see Frodo there being munched by a wolf, the yellow Kid being castrated by Bruce or watch Del Toro riding in a car w/ a gunbarrel sticking outta his forehead. A little of that sorta thing goes a lonnnnnnng ways.The gals--every single one, by and large, was a hooker, either w/ or w/out a heart of gold. Not a single semi-believable woman in the lot. Now Don't get me wrong-I Very munch enjoy seeing Ms Dawson, Alba and Gugino etc etc dressed up like most of Prince's gals in the '80s-you know, Vanity, Sheila E and Appollonia. That's all well and good. But by the time you get to the scenes of these Uzi toting hookers in bondage gear letting loose on 'Bear' from Armageddon's guys in the streets below.....I was just laughing my head off. Any minute I was expecting Winger, Whitesnake and Warrant to show up. I did think Jessica Alba played a sweet part, and yes, Dawson's legs go up 9 stories. Calling it anything more than an adolescent fantasy though would be kind indeed.Yes I enjoyed it though, if you liked the old Film Noirs w/ Mitchum or Bogie, don't be expecting to see that level of quality here though. 'the Third Man' this is NOT--think more 'Pulp Fiction' churned thru Dick Tracy, Maybe. This is strictly from the world of Del Toro, Rodruiguez, Miller and Tarentino, period.***, not for kids or the squeamish. Helps to be a fan of the genre.",Null,2,6,3 April 2005
Windtalkers," A Mixed bag, but not nearly as bad as most here say.....
","I'm sure there are flaws in the movie here, lemme see if I noticed a few...: *Japanese WWII soldiers in Saipan fighting in a WWI Battle of the Marne trench warfare set-up. Uhhhh, no.*Saipan made out to look like it was fought right behind MASH 4077th. No....not California Desert. Try a Volcanic Pacific Island w/ some jungle.*Couldn't tell the two blonde GI's apart. The Redneck looked like the guy who gives the little girl candy.*Adam Beach looked like Lou Diamond Phillips. Roger Willie was more convincing as a Navajo. Just saying--maybe I'm way off? *Cage was basically channeling John Wayne from 'Sands of Iwo Jima' save for the fact that Wayne as Sgt Stryker was 1000 times more believable. You know, ala the Duke and Rambo, never misses what he shoots at, a gazillion rounds miss him, etc.*CGI planes were goofy.*Shelling was stupidly accurate.*Japanese guys couldn't hit the broadside of a barn at 4 feet.*Leb from Armageddon didn't really cut it as Gunny, though I thought Christian Slater was better, before he lost his head. That was--well sick and weird.*Banzai charge in daylight from strong uphill positions--somehow I don't think the Japanese were that stupid.*Filmers missed the chance to tell us about the Navajo code-breakers.What was good? *Two Navajo guys. I liked Roger Willie the best.*Cage was alright, quit complaining. Same part he played in the Rock and whatever.*Overkill violence-well 'Private Ryan' had it along w/ 'Black Hawk Down'. It's just the cliché now. If you don't put it in, you will be accused of whitewashing combat. Woo was in a no win game there. I admit his 'Face off' techniques got real old in a hurry in this one.*I liked the cardboard cross being knocked over--a Plan 9 From Outer Space nod, ya think? No? Whatever they left that in....*Tears of the Sun was a lot worse.**1/2 outta **** for trying though I think they missed the boat on it, yes. It ain't terrible though.",6,8,14,7 May 2005
Braveheart," Gotta like it...
","This is the kinda medieval flick that you wanna see when you go to the movies; it's what Gladiator and Rob Roy were too. I really enjoyed the action, the period detail, battle scenes great, plus Mel plays this guy just the way you wanna see him played-driven, tortured, focused.It does have its gory moments, and no, it might not be a documentary as far's the historical events go-of that I'm not sure, nor do I care per se. Gibson has given us a very good film; it's a shame they don't make them like this more often. Did it deserve to beat out 'Apollo 13' for the Oscar? I donno. But it was a good choice seems to me.***1/2 outta ****",8,0,2,21 November 2000
Gladiator," Russell has something to Crowe about....OWWWW!! Sorry...
","This is really pretty good, a nice updated combo of 'Braveheart'(see the great opening battle scene), Ben-Hur, Spartacus, Samson and Delilah, Quo Vadis, etc(Coliseum/gladiator stuff) and Rob Roy. Maximus/Crowe is the same basic guy, big strong hero/general/fighter who winds up taking on the sadistic/twisted Fop at the end, sword on sword. Spoiler alert!!!!!!!!Somehow or other I was let down the the failure of the coup-I think that that would have brought the film to a somewhat more fitting end myself, and more satisfying. But Sod it-what they did do was pretty good in and of itself. No big problems here.I felt the scenes showing Commodius and his sister were long and draggy in places, and to be honest, by about the 4th time they showed Commodius there making Googoo eyes at Dear Sister and prattling about how big a failure he'd felt in his fathers' eyes...I think we got the idea by then, thank you. Phoenix was pretty good as the fop and Neilson ditto as his sister, its just that their scenes fell flat at times.I liked Derek Jacobi, didn't recognize Richard Harris(!!) as Marcus Aurelius-but enjoyed his scenes-and thought that this was a fitting fineale to Oliver Reed's career too. Go back the Wolfman, Three Musketeers, etc, and he's played similar parts...it is good Hollywood saw fit to haul him and Harris and Derek Jacobi into this for one more go around.Crowe carries the film, I could have pictured a younger Mitchum or Bronson doing it but nec. any better. If you like action, spectacle, Ridley Scott in general or stuff like Braveheart-then this one is for you.*** outta ****, involving, shows Rome as not film has before, well done.",Null,0,0,6 May 2000
Contact," O so well intentioned, but....
","DULL!! DULL!! DULL!!WOWSERS!! This thing went on for almost 2 and a half hours before we got to see-SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!!
--Jodi do the 'Field of Dreams' bit in outer space. Kinda touching but...so was 'Land of the Lost' if you were in the right mood.I didn't buy a word of this. NASA was presented as corrupt, religion as idiotic and medieval minded, the media sheep(well, that part was close...) and so on and so forth. I got the impression that Jodi Foster's character was a Prophet on a Mission for Science(Bill Nye where are you when we need you?!) and that everyone who disagreed with her was a fool,ignorant or reactionary.Sure.It was great seeing Rob Lowe play that babyfaced Christian Coalition lobbyist, and I always like James Woods-but that was about it.
Part of the problem, besides the great length of the film, and its sanctimoniousness-is the casting of Matthew M. While he was good in 'A Time to Kill' and 'EdTV', here he is simply too young and too much Beatnik Man to be the Billy Graham-like character from the Book Carl Sagan wrote which the film is based on. He tries, just isn't the most convincing that is all.Another problem, which I had with the Sagans(Ann Druyan too) is that they seem to think that we give a hoot about their religious beliefs(or in their case, lack of same.) Now, I hate to break it to'em, but NOBODY CARES. If Carl Sagan was an athiest, great, whatever got him through the night. What he was paid for, and was good at, was explaining what the Methane seas of Titan meant for in the search for life. Not his religious convictions--hell, I don't care anymore about that than I would finding out his favorite Beatle was Ringo.Get the idea? Professional opinion makers-Isaac Asimov, Andy Rooney, Sagan, James Randi, Rush, Stern, Imus, etc. all seem to think they have to have an Opinion on EVERYTHING, and because they're about to pontificate, we are all out here waiting with baited breath, hanging on every word.
In a word-No.Not even close.And not to be cruel, but to all those agog with Jodi Foster's performance, okay it was good, but it was also the same old glacial, intense type of job she's done in everything from 'Hotel New Hampshire','Foxes' and 'The Little Girl who Lives down the Lane', 'Freaky Friday' and 'Carny'. She has nothing on Theresa Russell, Kathleen Turner or even Kim Catrell guys, I hate to break it to you. Just a better press rep and better agents.So--what is my Contact rating--*** outta ****, because it Tries at least to make you think, it is well acted and executed despite itself; but Carl Sagan--really shoulda left message sending to Western Union.Ditto Jodi.",Null,0,2,2 October 1999

I think that Denholm Elliot added class to whatever he was in, and that was no different here.Supposedly a #4 will be in the works, whenever Lucas, Steven S. and Ford can get the free time.

Goodfellas," Hmmm....Over-rated-see this or Casino and you've seen it before.
","I hadn't ever seen this one, save for parts on the idiot box, so I didn't quite know what to expect. To hear the critics drooling about GF, you'd think this was better than the first two Godfathers or Casino or whatever. Well I hate to burst anyone's bubble, but it's NOT. Its too long, Ray Liotta is OK but comes off having as much Mobster credibility onscreen as Potsy from 'Happy Days'. And I didn't feel bad for him one little bit when the Feds got him and his wife.The rest-DeNiro, Pesci, Sorvino-age some in this thing, which after all goes from c.53-the early 80s. But does Ray? Not from what I could see. I donno why that was, as he is about as babyfaced as Robbie Benson, its hard to tell how old the guy is, but I do know he should have shown some aging at least. Its almost as if he's stuck in the same age the whole film and watches the rest of the mob universe parade by.Watch this, then see Casino-you have basically the same movie, with DeNiro and Pesci trotting out the same old characters they have each played scads of times. Yeah you hear all about DeNiro's great versatility, but c'mon-Raging Bull this ain't. He was somewhat more refined in Casino than he was here, he shot more folks in Ronin, he was loonier in 'The Fan', but I think DeNiro's just mailing it in sometimes now. Pesci goes kookoo at the drop of a hat in this, I really despised the vile scene of him shooting the young kid waiter, and wonder what Scorsese was thinking when he put that in. Don't give me that 'its what these guys do in real life, its in character' crap-that is like the equally so-violent-its-stoopid aluminum baseball bats chorus that you get to see at the finale of Casino. Overkill is overkill, plain and simple.Pesci was better in JFK and Casino, but played the same kinda guy too, save in JFK Ferrie was, well....like his name sez.You get the same old Scorsese bag of tricks-his folks play some minor parts, the characters narrate the goings ons, the camera work is flashy, the Mob is alternately glorified then shown for what it is, the shootings, explosions and stabbings are filmed with bravado, skill and from many angles, jest in case you happened to miss them the first time. I get the feeling when seeing Casino or Goodfellas that I'm watching a guy with a PHD in Film School showing off to all us peons. And I'm not impressed. I have seen this all before.Lorraine Bracco was pretty good then kinda shelved as the film went on. Paul Sorvino was probably the best thing about the film, and he just trots out the same old 'Mean Paul' bit you can see in the 'Rocketeer' and 'Oh God', if you want my honest opinion.This film was Not better than Dancing With Wolves, and therefore, was Not unfairly passed over by Oscar, despite the rantings of its many Acolytes.Good movie? Sure. Great? Nahhh. Better than the Three Godfathers? Nope, save for maybe the IIIrd.*** outta ****; somewhat of a big 'So What' reaction by Gazzo-2 this time out.",9,1,3,27 February 2000

Less is More where THAT is concerned, Hollywood. C'mon.Spoilers below!!!Plot was somewhat confusing, and you could see Brian Cox's character arc a mile away, trust me. The whole business about payoffs and Russki oil-barons plotting against each other was a little too convoluted for it's own good, too.I liked Joan Allen, Famke there and in general the whole cast, but what is w/ keeping Julia Stiles to a glorified walk-on in both movies? She seems to stand out like a sore thumb amidst all the spook goings ons-but as she is a decent performer-give her more to do.Damon should do at least one more of these movies, it's def. the best work he has done in a while.

It does depend wayyy too much on the star's faces being animated as fish, it does spew out cliché's and popculture refs. in place of actual dialogue, it also hasn't an original bone in it's body.Know what? Didn't bother me in the least. DeNiro and Scorsese were funny, Will Smith as always was Big Willie Style, Zellwinger and Couric and Jolie essentially played themselves okay if nothing else. You will enjoy the gay veggie Shark(Jack Black) gussied up as a dolphin, the reggae jellyfish are a hoot, and the whole staged fight between 'Oscar' and 'Lenny' is fun too. Best use of an Elvis tune in a movie in some time.Can't say that this is gonna be remembered for long or anything, but it IS worth watching if you like the stars or just want a fun time in CGI land.

I didn't think Clooney's dialogue was the most convincing(needed more of a Foghorn Leghorn blowhard quality), the KKK scene was quite bracing, some of the scenes(the Sirens, for example, Babyface Nelson) seemed to stop just when they were getting going.
But you have to like its quirky, easy humour, the Mississippi landscape, the 30's vibes and the two Goobers who chased after Clooney, right up til the Cow on the Barn scene. Very funny.A unique blend, hmmmmmm *** outta **** for the good stuff.",Null,0,0,18 July 2001
