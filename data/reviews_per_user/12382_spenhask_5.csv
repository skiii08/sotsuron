The New World," The New World review
","I watched this movie for my U.S History Through Film class. Now I´m reviewing for the same reason. The film was about this guy John Smith who traveled with some crew into the new world to establish a new colony. During the film he meets this girl named Pocahantus. They hang out for a couple years then John Smith leaves. Then it just shows the life of Pocahantus afterwards. I question Pocahantus being 14 in the film. I question her ever seeing John Smith after he took off. I also question the Indians being so accepting of John Smith when he came to the new world for the first time. There are no connections to any other movies I´ve seen. I like the scenery as well as the people when they actually talked. I like the time period the film takes place in. I also like to see Pocahantus develop as a person. I didn´t like how the characters rarely talked it made the film boring. In conclusion, I can see what this movie was going for but it didn´t work. It ended up being too boring. they didn´t do enough with what they had to work with. They mostly just showed off the scenery and had the characters just mumble a lot. But when they did actually communicate and got the story moving along it was good. So there you have it my review for The New World",5,0,0,30 August 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid review
","I'm writing this review for my U.S. History through Film class. The plot of the movie is there's these two robbers who rob this really rich bank and as a result they get chased down from place to place. Eventually, they go to Bolivia and rob a few banks and then someone notices them and gets the police to try to get them and the story ends on a cliffhanger. I like the action, plot, and adventure in the movie. However, sometimes the loud sounds in the movie kept me from hearing what the characters were saying so I didn't really like that. Overall, this movie was pretty good and it would be nice to see others like it.",7,2,2,23 October 2018
The Alamo," Alamo Review
","I am writing this review for my U.S. History through film class. The plot is that the Americans and the Mexicans are fighting for the land of Texas. I only watched half of this movie so this review might not be entirely accurate. But I liked the war and setting as well as the dialogue when it was used well. When it wasn't used well, I didn't really like the dialogue. So this movie is alright but it could be better so I'd like to see others like but a little better.",7,0,2,9 October 2018
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman Review
","I am reviewing this film for my U.S. History Through Film class. I thought this movie was overall pretty good. I mainly liked the fighting and the main plot. Speaking of fighting, Wonder Woman had this to say about it 'I will fight for those who cannot fight for themselves'. I didn't much like the dialogue between characters though. The main plot of the movie is that this plane lands in Wonder Woman's world and this guy ion the plane tells them about the war (World War 1). The people suspect Eres is behind it so Wonder Woman goes to stop the war. Overall, I was fine with the movie and it would be okay to see others like it.",7,2,2,15 November 2018
Cinderella Man," Cinderella Man Review
","I am writing a review on this for my U.S History Through Film class. The plot of the movie is that the Great Depression takes place and James J. Braddock needs money and his boxing career starts declining. He works on the docs for a little while and then he starts making a big come back in his boxing career. Until eventually, he faces the world champion and there's an epic battle over the world champion title. I loved the action, plot, and flow of the story. However, sometimes during boxing scenes, it became extremely difficult to hear what the people in the film were saying. Overall, this film was very good and it would be amazing to see others like it.",9,1,1,4 December 2018
