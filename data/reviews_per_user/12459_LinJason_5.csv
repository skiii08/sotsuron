Black Swan," Stunning piece of art that strives for perfection
","A grand masterpiece of film art by Darren Aronofsky that is highly empowered by visuals and sounds in synergy with a remarkable performance by Natalie Portman as the ballerina who seeks nothing but perfection in her pursuit of performance art. Likely to be disturbing in the second half with relentless boundary crossings between reality and illusions, it is nevertheless one of the best films of 2010.In my opinion, this is a more of a fine piece of art rather than film. After all its subject of interest is of ballet and how a ballerina undergoes a dark venture in seek of perfection through severely distorted visuals of reality and illusions. 'Black Swan' begins with a dream sequence and isn't afraid to continue dreaming for the rest of the film.Aronofsky bravely pursued his dreams as an artistic filmmaker.Dreams are supposed to be bright and positive, but not in here. 'Black Swan' starts off with a highly-disciplined Nina who appears to be shiny and pristine and determined to be the Swan Queen, the leading protagonist of the new production Swan Lake. Never did Nina realise how demanding that role will be of her as it requires her to sport double contrasting identities as both the White and Black Swan.Never will we expect anybody to achieve excellence in two or more fields, it applies here as well. Nina is trying for the almost impossible task of embodying both the Angel and Devil. The only way is to lose her own self and enter darkness.Perhaps unknowingly, Natalie Portman does similar as Nina in this film and renders a near perfect performance as she has successfully entered the skins of the ballerina. Adding on to the element of conviction, Portman has been reportedly practicing ballet for 10 months prior to the film production in order to improve the feel of grace and competency in the performing art.Such dedication attracts much admiration.Darkness ensues in the form of nightmarish sequences that are pieced together by artful visuals captured by Matthew Libatique and dramatic score by Clint Mansell. Aronofsky threatens the audience's emotions by instilling unrest via effectively alternating between reality and illusions through the perspective of Nina as well as the amazing editing by Andrew Weisblum. Together, these grips you tightly without letting go and only to be compensated by the graceful ballet moves.At some point, you're almost inside Nina's realm.The question comes pouring to you upon the end of the credit roll: Is Nina's pursuit of perfection justified by her own passion or just a mere empty destination that she is coerced by those around her into reaching? You might like to take a step back and relate this to the current capitalist society of elitism, where everyone strives to be atop of others. Corporate ladders, Dean's lists, Power struggle, these are some of the tragedies that witness several resorting to everything in order to continue their ascend.This is further probed by the egoistic Thomas who never cease to push his ballerinas to extremes in order to attain results, where his ego seems to have outweighed his passion for ballet (if any). He could very well just be building a platform to sleep with them, as suggested briefly in the film. Likewise, Lily is possibly an innocent nemesis that is self-generated by Nina's heightened fear of losing at her game.The higher you climb, the more edgy you become of others in paranoia.No matter how you see it, it is undeniable that Aronofsky is one of the greatest filmmaking artist in the industry and has produced yet another stunning piece of art that has pushed fellow cast and crew into striving for perfection. (The Singapore big screen release version is passed with cuts, a move that deems to dilute the film's endeavour of perfection pursuit.) As remarkably flawless it may appear to be, it is nevertheless a tad bit short of perfection.For future improvement can only be possible with imperfection.",9,0,2,20 February 2011
127 Hours," Nothing less of an inspirational cinematic experience
","Technically and inspirationally, this film has all the flair in instilling great cinematic moments that are often undermined by several. It's a film about a man being trapped in a fixed location for a little over 5 days, this is where Director Danny Boyle shows you how it can be made into a watchable 90 minute film that is worth every single cent of your ticket purchase.If you've seen how the film is made, you'd have known how much effort has been drafted into this production where a base camp is set in the middle of some wilderness and helicopters transport crew and equipment to and fro every shooting day. Cameras and their operators were set up with climbing ropes like mountaineers and one might say that this production could be one of the most demanding.So is the story and experience of Aron Ralston.Based upon the amazing true account of Ralston, this film is made in tribute to his courage to stand up against nature and allowing his will to live to outshine all adversary. Being trapped with a boulder pinning your right hand against the canyon walls inside the claustrophobic cracks of the Blue John Canyon isn't a situation that anyone will want to find themselves in.James Franco makes a terrific acting career performance and is probably by far the best we've seen of him. 127 Hours will definitely become his pivotal point as it allowed him to break free from conventional roles and portrayed one of the best sides to him that deserves watching. It's great to see him getting nods, even though people are pinning hopes on Colin Firth to eventually win. In my opinion, his rendition of Aron Ralston was very realistic and made me feel for him during the course of the film, which is what acting is all about - realism within fiction.Wait, it's more like achieving realism within realism.If you are thinking how watchable a film is when it merely depicts a man trapped within the cracks of a canyon for 127 hours under the screening time of about 90 minutes, my suggestion here to you is this.Just go watch it to immerse yourself in what is probably one of the best cinematic experience ever.Boyle has yet again proved his flair in filmmaking and it's exactly what makes him one of the best in the industry. He's already proved himself countless times especially with his previous winner 'Slumdog Millionaire' and who doesn't love it when it took everyone by storm during its year of release?A visually stunning film that borrows from great editing and cinematography by Jon Harris and Anthony Dod Mantle/Enrique Chediak respectively. We see stylised treatment in the film with the occasional mesmerising landscapes of the canyons. Also not forgetting the original music by A.R. Rahman that made the entire 90 minutes so much more entertaining and enjoyable as a whole.127 Hours is a film that gets you deeply involved even after your step out of the theatre, thinking (or rethinking) about your life and the wonders of it. Often we tend to feel that we are in control of our lives but life is never simplistic enough for anybody to fully hold a good grasp upon. Here we see a talented Ralston who is so confident and full of life (and of himself in some manner) that he has always thought that navigating though life's mysteries and wonders under the most risky situations would be the best after-dinner desserts he could possibly have.That was before the element of nature came into play.Under the power of nature, man is belittled to a tiny speck of existential form as seen here in 127 Hours. Drastic climatic conditions, lack of food and water supply, lack of sleep, claustrophobic location, and eerie silence during most parts of the days and nights. What keeps a man going here will be his determination and will to live and survive. We see him talking to his video camcorder most of the times, his only companion to converse with that is also probably what keeps him sane.Ralston performs the unimaginable feat of severing his own right forearm, which is graphically portrayed in this film without ever showing much of him actually doing it through editing (it's a little gruesome in thought but if that's what bothering you, it's not a reason worth to skip this film). What's horrible rather, is the sound that we hear during the controversial scene, which brings one much closer to realism than the sight of it.So it's a battle between nature, Ralston, and his will to live, and it's one that you shouldn't miss for any reason at all.",9,3,6,20 February 2011
The Expendables," Brawn over Brain for your ticket.
","Graced by tons of muscles, grit and explosive firepower, this is the Golden Age 80's action genre reliving itself in modern theatres this month. With 7 major sets of Hollywood muscles working themselves out on the big screen, you will be buying more brawn than brain with your ticket.Reckon we've just listed a long list of action heroes and to add on, there's also retired Expendables member - Tool (Mickey Rourke) who delivers all the non-lethal substance. Tool's emotional extreme close-up scene of war-inflicted psychological trauma was the only one that came from the muscular line-up to melt hearts, while the rest served to only stab hearts.Stingy dialogue lines are delivered by the cast, as they are mostly one-line punchers, but a healthy dosage of humour filled some of them. The fun derives from said humour and later on, the saturated watts of firepower and violence that were a product of the strong egos. Speaking of which, Stallone did a good job in handling all the egos without having these veterans feel individualistic all in vie of screen time.By having rapid cuts of intense action for the climatic royal rumble in the closing chapter.The closing action scene is indeed one grand finale as Stallone leaves the best for the last with massive explosions, lethal projectile buffet, fierce close-quarter combat exchanges and everything Hollywood once threw in for classic action genre closures.It wasn't a bad thing, hell yeah.Stallone isn't the best directing action choreographer in the business, but he has reminded us of how veteran glory has been achieved in the past decades through classics like Rocky, Rambo, The Terminator, and Die Hard. He isn't exactly full of himself as a veteran, as he leaves space for the young blood to prove their worth with the likes of Jason Statham.Amidst all the male testosterone smeared across the film, we do love how these sturdy men own little bits of big boy moments where they do share their hearts out and talk about their love affairs and comfort each other's soul. All in the name of brotherhood. Statham is seen hurling Stallone a question in the film as follows.'Have you ever been rejected by a woman before?'Already in the talks of a sequel as Stallone expresses an idea in mind recently, we are certain of how Hollywood works after all these years. Just like how it's mentioned in the film, 'We don't care what the business is about, the only thing you need to know is the job's real, and the money's real'.If you are able to discount the story-telling hindsight and view this as a classic 80's genre reliving, Stallone brings on some raw and fierce action in blatantly painful fashion and shows that he still has it despite being at the age of 64.",6,1,5,21 August 2010
X-Men: First Class," A blockbuster mutant with hybrid powers of an entertaining spectacle & a good film
","Some call this a brilliant franchise reboot, while others might say that it's the star of this summer thus far. I say that X-Men: First Class is a blockbuster mutant, one that sports the hybrid powers of a commercial box office cash cow, an entertaining spectacle, and a good film. Dramatically fueled by some great cast performance, X-Men: First Class makes sure that the message of being different and proud to be, gets across firmly.Usually from the first frame of the film, you'd know through some insane gut feeling if it'd be a good film. X-Men: First Class is one such film that sends good vibes as it begins in 1944's Poland during World War II. The first chapter of a young Erik Lehnsherr who is able to bend metal gates when emotionally charged, especially of grievance and anger.That very Erik, as most of us know it, will eventually become Magneto.Erik is well portrayed by Michael Fassbender who exudes a charismatic demeanour of a classic British spy/gentleman. In aid of simplifying that, think of him as a good resemblance to a young 007 - James Bond. Daniel Craig should be worried.Everything points towards that, with the Cold War setting and a offshore stand-off between the US and the Soviet Union in Cuban waters, two of the greatest powers in history. There's an innuendo hint at the real-life Cuban Missile Crisis as they used it to create tension, although not to suggest factual evidence.Wait, or did mutants actually had a part in it?That is very much so in the first two thirds of the film when Erik befriends a young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), who manages to inspire him to goodness that enlightened his magnetic potentials. Strength comes from somewhere between anger and serenity, that sentence alone underlined the core virtues and wise maturity of a young Professor X.Much like how Charles is the glue to all the mutants featured in this film, Director Matthew Vaughn (of Kick-Ass fame) did an exceptional job and inspired us that blockbusters aren't just a measure of blatant bang-bang-booms and exorbitant senseless sequences. In maintaining a great momentum and pace throughout the 132 minute blockbuster, he confiscated the entirety of the audience's attention span of interest and never giving back until the credit roll.There's a much desired focus on the story and character development (credits to a big team of story and screenwriters), which in my opinion is the greatest strength of the film that gives it a worthy edge over so many blockbusters that have revolved around the weary tried-and- tested formula. The dialogues were kept witty and at times amusing, which is uncommon of the one-liners often abused by summer blockbusters. Keep in mind that this is another Marvel superhero adaptation, so my expectations prior to the screening was somewhat along the line of a loud routine entertainment.I was so wrong about it.There's spectacular action when called for, but never saturated and overboard. Just what'll suffice and contribute to plot plausibility. For that, Vaughn gains my admiration and respect when most other blockbusters have the pressure of installing intentional crowd-pleasing plot devices with the 'more is more' mentality when it's really just senseless overkill.All the action you'll find are very nicely coated by stellar visual effects (by the likes of Weta Digital) and scored by Henry Jackman's influential music. I'd also like to add that the score played a critical role in veiling this film with the intended serious overtone and gave it the right feel that also helps with setting the right rhythm. Think along the line of how music gave Avatar its atmospheric life and how it also made Inception feel so grand and mysterious. Production values are very high indeed, especially when you can expect a naval confrontation between an American fleet and a Soviet fleet disturbed by the play of mutants.Not all of the sideline mutant characters enjoyed adequate limelight in an attempt to avoid the overcrowding disruptive effect on the plot, but Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), and Emma Frost (January Jones) were given some and they made good of the opportunity. Some even offered the audience great eye-candy that doesn't feel forced upon.Before you'd begin to think that nobody remembers the bad guy, there's Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw (also the nightmare nemesis of Erik's ill-fated childhood) who really resembles an ambitious Hitler with menace. Memorable and rather short-lived in my opinion, but there's no doubt about Bacon's performance here (we're talking about a veteran here, after all).So there's a great cast, good star performance, alluring story, gripping pace, pleasant eye- candy, high production value, beautiful visual effects, and appealing action sequences. That doesn't sound like a blockbuster, it's a mutated form of it.Mutant and proud.Oh and that's not all, also do watch out for a crude brief cameo by a key familiarity.",9,9,18,1 June 2011
The Social Network," Where's the 'like' button of this film?
","Quick, ruthless and cunningly brilliant. This is two hours of rapid dialogue spells that draw your attention and energy away to leave you in a mesmerising dazzle. The Social Network strictly adheres itself to the traits of the computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg who created Facebook and shares his account through his eyes, prompting one to step into his shoes, enter the realm of geeky genius, and finally seeking the 'like' button of this film (if it exists).It is true that this film, with its talented cast and crew, will achieve greatness like how Facebook achieved worldwide success. Seemingly uninspiring little ideas, when put together and conceived by a genius mind, gave rise to the Facebook social networking phenomenon that has integrated within our daily lives like oxygen to a brilliant mind.David Fincher's film is no less different.Who would have thought that a movie about the founding of Facebook and its creator Mark Zuckerberg will be so engaging with wits sprinkled across every dialogue exchanged. Drawing reference to the geeky nature of Zuckerberg's mind, the film has catered for an intellectual fast-paced treatment that is worthy of a Harvard computer programmer. The language at play here is indirectly complex, jargon-filled and is always full of hidden underlying meanings, insults and sarcasm.Like how Zuckerberg is always constantly at work to improve and move ahead of others, the astonishing intensity of the dialogues suggests how one has to pay full attention to digest and keep up with the story development before risking getting lost and left behind.Though a little demanding, but it is rewarding at the end of Zuckerberg's talkative journey.Already a public-listed quality, Fincher's direction is exquisitely powerful with the sensational screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. Answering the call to achieve technical excellence is the beautiful lowlight imagery and the amazing play of DOF (depth of field) by cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and his RED ONE camera with the latest Mysterium-X sensor that improves low- light capabilities, rendering great details. These are highly reflected in the dim night club scenes as well as the rowing competition in UK.Ensemble cast plays a huge contribution to the film's credibility and emotions drawn from its audience, especially of Eisenberg as Zuckerberg and Timberlake as Napster founder Parker. They were spot on choices for their respective roles and were responsible for leading the show with superb multi-dimensional character portrayal.Everything revolving Zuckerberg's inept social proficiency gave birth to the revolutionary digital social experience, one that he will be in control of and on top of. The social network dream is really based upon Zuckerberg's dreams of living as a high social butterfly, where monetary prospects of his creation is of secondary importance to him.He is more concerned being labelled as an a**hole by his date over advertising revenues.However, in the midst of achieving greatness for Facebook, Zuckerberg has gradually twisted his perception in his life and lives by questionable rules and beliefs. He turns delusional as he ousted his best friend Saverin out of Facebook due to visionary disagreement of Facebook's direction. The verbal virus worms from Parker drift them apart further.The interesting notion about Zuckerberg is, he actually knows what he wants and what he is after right from the beginning. Despite being supposedly 'brainwashed' by Parker, he remains nonchalant against the evils that Parker is advocating, such as drugs and underage girls. Zuckerberg remains an unpredictable and hard to understand personality who works alone in his own unique manner.Zuckerberg seems to be amazed by a tiny bubble that has appeared before him and he serves to protect the bubble at all cost upon seeing what the bubble might be capable of. As the bubble grows bigger, surrounding bystanders become jealous of his success and tries to sabotage and burst it. This forces Zuckerberg to be alone with his bubble and when it finally bursts, as all bubbles will eventually, he has to realise at the end of the day that what really matters is the beauty of the initial bubble forming that captivated him.Zuckerberg is after all, not a genius by choice and yearns to live sociably well among others.The Social Network has to be one of the greatest cinematic surprise that expands the boundaries of an auto-bibliographic genre. Apparently, many moments in the film will be possibly telling you how nothing is impossible.The Social Network is impossibly good.",10,0,1,27 November 2010
