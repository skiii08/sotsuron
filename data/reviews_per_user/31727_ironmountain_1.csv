Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Mr. Cohen should remember that only six decades ago Russians and Cozachs were fighting against Nazis to protect his forefathers
","It is hard to believe that how many people enjoy such an insulting movie. At the very beginning of the movie,traced on an Eurasian map, Borat's plane stops in Turkey, Libya, Russia, and Ukraine, without touching down anywhere in continental Europe, which is supposed to be immune of 'cultural inferiority' represented by Borat and his subhuman values. That route gives the whole idea of movie.Trying to give the impression of Judeo-Christian world is the main thing and the 'others' who are Eastern Europeans, Muslims (both fits with Kazakhstan) etc represent all kinds of stupidity, ugglyness etc. Mr. Cohen should remember that only six decades ago, while their people have been put in concentration camps and eventually in the ovens by Nazis and their allies in Germany, Vichy-France, Austria, Poland, Nederlands, Sweden and many other European territories, Russians along with many Cozachs have fought against them and helped to stop Nazi plans about a 'final solution' destined against his people . They have never chased Jews or their puppets on the streets for any reason. Unlike Western Europeans. He should look at the further history, beyond WW2 to see what have been done against Jews in Spain, Britain and almost anywhere in Elite and Christian Europe. Eastern Europe and Ottoman Empire have always gave shelter to his people.Ironically,evidenced by some scenes of the Romanian classic car 'Dacia' which has showed up in a few frames (which is a second class Renault 12 looks like being assembled in the dim light), Borat's village is within glorious European Union borders and the 'ugly subhuman' 'Cozachs' in his village are actual 'prime class', European Union citizens and the elite people of that Romanian village.(They do not look like Cozachs anyway). Mr. Cohen apparently has no idea about real Kazakhstan and it's brave and people.The whole movie is nothing but a shame!",Null,1,2,24 February 2009
