Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Where's Lee van Cleef??
","As neither a rabid fan or a detractor of Tarantino I must say I enjoyed the first vol. better simply because the action propelled the story and didn't give you much time to think about how thin the plot was. And there really isn't much here to make you care about any of these characters. The scene with the killer and the home pregnancy test where we're supposed to care about the bride fell totally flat.I'm sure this film is going to get TONS of positive reviews simply because Tarantino is one of the only original filmmakers able to command big budget films these days and fans will fawn over anything he does because there is no else to fawn over. But it seems people only respond to action and kinetics in films and not on plots and characters, which is sad because it is possible to combine both and Tarantino has the talent to do it if he'd only grow up a little. This is a lot of fun but it's not a masterpiece in any sense.Carradine is great and so is Michael Parks with a superlative job doing a Mexican pimp. Also If you're going to use music from other films take it from obscure films. The music used from the Good the Bad and the Ugly(it's in the top 100 best movies on imdb for christ sake!) is so recognizable its almost blatant plagerism to use it. I was expecting to see Lee van Cleef ride out of the desert and Kill Bill. Now that would be something!",4,2,4,17 April 2004
The Terminal," Good Spielberg
","This is Spielberg when he is good, which kicks the ass of most people working in Hollywood today at their best. Just like the saying that even bad Hitchcock is better than most other's best. I am amazed how people just can't relax and enjoy a decent film these days, judging by the reviews here. There is nothing in this film that is less than good. The acting is excellent and Spielberg's direction is effortless and undistracting. Except for a few over the top transitions and cuts the flow and blocking of scenes is the very definition of understated excellence. Can't anyone appreciate this anymore because it is in fact quite rare. Very few Directors have this much assurance in technique and it should be savored. Instead of going out of his way to show us how visually good he is, he can just relax and let his talent shine without making a big deal out of it. It's a pleasure to watch just for that alone.",10,0,1,11 September 2004
