Blade Runner 2049," It's hard to make any sequel after...the original Blade Runner.
","Good acting, nice visuals, decent soundtrack...But...the story-line sucks. It seems that it was overdone in the process of invention of 'the deep meaning' and the long and quite boring pathway of that process' revelation. On top of that, even though B. Wallfisch demonstrated quite an effort to rediscover the atmosphere of the original Bade Runner, there is no magic of Vangelis in this movie. Nada. A couple of tunes were 'incorporated', but overall it sounded rather synthetic. It's OK to watch it once, IMHO. I would not keep it in the home collection.",8,3,6,17 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Lacking a LOT in all aspects...
","Oh my...it is not even entertaining. During many episodes you catch yourself thinking: please get it over with, I know what is next, I know EXACTLY how it ends...Not a great sign for the whole movie if this kind of thought start to repeat from the very beginning. So...apart from the fact that Daisy Ridley is an eye candy, there is not much else to watch in this next-Disney-failure.",4,7,11,3 January 2020
American Made," Enjoyable watch, good for the home collection...
","I rarely give anything more 7 stars, but this one deserves firm 8 (I would shorten it a bit, IMHO). Great acting, very natural humor and fluid action of all actors. Outstanding work of camera men and post-production team. Tom Cruise at his best. I can't think of any category of viewers where this movie won't be a hit.",8,1,3,17 October 2017
Black Panther," Too bad there is no ZERO stars rating..
","...because this is exactly the case when you need precisely ZERO stars. There is no story in this 'movie'. Nada. Acting? Remember your congested nose from a cold, allergy, sinus infectio etc etc, when you have anosmia? That feeling of frustration when you can't enjoy your favorite dish because you can't really smell or taste it? Similar feeling from the 'acting' in this 'movie'. 
Yeah, well...CGI. But you can't really entertain anyone nowadays with abundance of CGI. Total insult of the viewers. Absolute boring, bleak failure.",1,3,5,26 May 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Comedy? Really?
","Only an idiot can make a comedy based on such a 'funny' matter.
Garbage. Except for the final song, of course.",3,1,6,4 May 2020
