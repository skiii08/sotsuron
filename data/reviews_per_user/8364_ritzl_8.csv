Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Mean, selective, attempt at comedy. Don't waste your money.
","I am not easily offended, and I have to say the gross-out humor in this movie was mostly funny. But this is only one of two films that I have ever walked out on.First, I agree with the Kazakhstan government. This was an successful attempt to defame and ridicule a country. It was 100 minutes of unrelenting and mean-spirited stereotyping, that was mainly aimed at Muslims but included its fair share of Christian ridicule. BTW, Kazakhstan is a majority Russian Orthodox country.Did I say mean-spirited yet? The whole movie was principally an attempt at showing how stupid and evil Muslims are. Followed by the stupid and evil Christians. No attempt was made to show stupid and evil Jews. A few Jewish stereotypes were shown, but only to highlight how evil and stupid Christians and Muslims are. I could have lived with the humor if it had in fact been balanced out in both tone and content (a la perhaps a dark and brooding Carlos Mencia). But it wasn't. This movie was a full-bore, relentless, people who are not like me are repulsive, meme.As a result of all this, this movie itself became a part of what it was trying to parody, namely ignorance and meanness in the world. If you are what you parody, you cancel yourself out and cease to have anything meaningful to say. So it was bye, bye Borat, for me.I gave it a 3 for the movie magic aspects of 'How did they get them say that?' and 'Where did they find these people?' and some of the humor. But otherwise, save your money.",3,6,13,11 November 2006
United 93," Reading the cast credits, and having seen the film...
","***POTENTIAL SPOILERS*** It is unclear to me how the hijacker actor credits could be so low and/or non-existent.The major draw of the film was how it all fit together. Cast and crew did this to near perfection.Especially the motivations of 'thems that would do such a thing.'You cannot bring to the screen the events of 9/11, and particularly that flight, a day on which I was en route to Baltimore, between 0800 and 1000 CDT, and not a whit was spoken on our flight about what happened, without showcasing the actions of the hijackers.These actors did a Great job in maintaining the issues that the hijackers probably had, which enabled the passengers to be heroes.Without making the hijackers the story, the actors portraying them did a great job. They weren't given their due.",8,1,5,4 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Theatrical version is great, but if you want Tolkein's World...
","...get the extended version.I certainly understand the requirement for pace and action in a film, but in this case the movie is an attempt to create Tolkein's world. The theatrical version succeeds on the pace level, but if you really want to enter into the world of Middle Earth, get the extended version.I believe that the extended version is much closer to injecting the viewer into Tolkein's world.  It is not as herky-jerky as the theatrical version.  You understand motivations, and are generally more immersed into the characters' situations.My hope is that the extended version of TTR does the same thing for that film.FOTR is a great movie. Saw it 8 times because my local theater held it over for 7 months.  I hope that New Line and PJ reward the fan support with a theatrical version of the extended version.   Or at least a re-release of the FOTR and TT extended versions in theaters prior to the release of ROTK. (Not that I'm holding my breath...)T/V 8/10;  E/V 9/10...",9,0,0,14 August 2003
Seabiscuit," Applause...
","I have only seen/experienced two popular movies in my short life (48) that have received applause in the theater.  Titanic was the first.  This was the second.  And not only did Seabiscuit get applause, but it got it twice during the movie.And not only from a Friday night crowd, but a smaller matinee crowd three weeks after release.   I have to say that this is a remarkable achievement, and I recommend this affirming film to kids, adults, and families.But make sure the DTS is on, as the race scenes are remarkable, both from a visual and sound perspective.  I have never been a jockey,  but I have raced horses side by side.  This movie gets it!!!BTW, Gary Stevens (George Woolf in the film) is amazing and adds a Huge element of realism to the film.  He was interviewed on 'Fresh Air' (NPR) and described his career injuries.  Profoundly moving interview.  Very dangerous occupation.  I had to revisit the film after I listened to this interview, and it made the viewing even more intense.For those of you that think NASCAR, or the NFL are tough, check out the Stevens interview.",8,0,0,14 August 2003
Inside Man," At Last!!
","Finally, what I have been looking for in a Spike Lee film. Nuance and texture, coupled with a not so deterministic result.To me, Spike Lee has always announced the result early on in the film, and then filled in the gaps. I am not sure why this happens, but it seems to be the case. Perhaps he has been limited by something. I don't know. I do know that I have always looked for something more than the visual wrap-around of the simple message in his films. This film combines what he has always brought to the table as far as novel/interesting/visual storyline, but adds complexity and acting subtlety to the mix. Great job!! except for the one 'odd' shot.Original and kept me thinking!8/10 for originality and nuanced direction.",8,1,1,2 April 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Great Movie, and some thoughts...
","I cannot echo strongly enough the overwhelming praise for this film.  Many here have seen its worth and I would concur.  I would like to add some thoughts to the discussion.On Gimli:  I have read for two years now the criticism of Gimli's humor.  I would just say that ALL the people I have known, that have known battle and death (and I am not one), have stated, unrelated to this film, that there is always someone that addresses imminent death with humor.  Gimli's realization by PJ is absolutely on the mark, and frankly welcome to me as a moviegoer as being real.  Some just have a lust and courage for the better side of life, in the face the alternative, and whatever the outcome.On PJ:  He has never shown himself to be able to bridge the gap between being an actor's director in small films (Heavenly Creatures) and a horror/special effects director (Frighteners, Evil Dead).  The first two movies in this trilogy reaffirmed my belief. HOWEVER, in this film, PJ has, as his characters have, grown to become equal to the task at hand.  This film captures the spectacle of battle macro, as motivated by the frailties and trancendencies of the micro of those involved.  Kudos... On Length:  Unlike the first two, the time flew by.  No lulls.  Only VERY minor plot holes (again, unlike the first two).On the Books:  I am a purist, but/and what PJ, FW, and PB, did with the script in this installment is totally understandable and warranted.On Acting:  The Henry V, St. Crispin's Day speeches given by Theoden (Pt. I), and Aragorn (Pt. II) were as moving as Shakespeare wrote them, and Olivier's and Branagh's deliveries. Probably as relevant today as they were in Olivier's time.On Relevance:  In a mythical sense and all that allows from the artistically derived poignancy, this movie is what  'Saving Private Ryan' was.  Stepping back and allowing imagination to take hold, every theme (IMHO) that Tolkein wrote about was represented in this movie (need I say, a cause worth fighting/loving for, sacrifice, winning but not without loss, fellowship, destiny, and resignation to that destiny), and is as relevant today as it was 80, 50, 40, 30, and 3 years ago.On The Ending:  Going to miss them all!! Thanks for the farewell...And (Finally!!) On the Oscars:  This trilogy IS one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking.  For the vision, for the risk, for the epic, for the technical achievements, but mostly, for the Gift.  If few or no awards are forthcoming, that is the problem of the Academy, not PJ or New Line.---Bring on Smaug!!",9,0,0,21 December 2003
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Timeless! For a reason...
","I just watched MPHG for about the 30. time and came here to look up some bios. To see reviews being written in 2019 is a testament to the incredible originality and enduring slyness of the Pythons and their humor. There isn't a scene in this movie that doesn't work on multiple, concurrent levels from slapstick to intellectual satire.It's all been said, but it is pleasant to see that it's still being said and appreciated. Thanks Pythons!!",9,0,0,14 July 2019
The Bourne Supremacy," Identity was the prelude, Supremency is the crescendo. I suspect the next one [?] will be the interlude.....
","I like well made action flicks.  Nowadays, they seem to be madewith special effects, as in Mission Impossible.  I went into thisthinking that it would be a special effects action flick, and was verymuch surprised (positively).But let me back up.  I have never read the books (are therebooks?).  I liked 'Identity.'  This film story tracks with the previousfilm (though you will probably have to refresh with the DVD), andcontinues the story.  Both are very gritty and 'real,'  which leads meto what I liked about both.The director completely left out any magical effects and filmed themovie as if 'you were there.'  Having been in an accident once, Igot the complete impression of 'you're in control until you're not,' ina very real sense.  This lead to the feeling that you were living inthe situation (in the movie sense, of course).  I liked it...*** SPOILERS***  In terms of context, I really wish that Hollywoodwould come to understand, or at least craft a script, thatrecognizes that the 'black' world does not talk on interceptable cellphones and does not leave the shades open, after it is recognizedthat the shades being left open is dangerous.  Maybe that's justhope beyond hope, but gosh, surely someone must know how todo this, creatively.Nonetheless, an intense thriller, well realized.  8/10 for the lack ofspecial effects.",8,2,2,25 July 2004
