Kill Bill: Vol. 2," help with ending question
","It took me two nights two watch both movies and I have two spoiler questions. One, what happened (it took a split second to miss)to Orin in the final fight when she started to bleed out in the snow? What injury caused her to bleed when Mamba said 'come at me with everything you've got'Next, my daughter got sick and I missed in the second movie what happen after Mamba tucked Bb into bed and left the room. How did she finally confront Bill (details if you could please.) Thank youAlthough this movie was incredibly violent the story line was what kept me interested.",Null,0,1,8 January 2007
