Iron Man 3," Disappointing
","Overall, it was pretty terrible. They tried being too funny, the new suit was stupid, War Machine didn't do anything except kick doors down, and Tony Stark barely fought as Iron man. Most sequels are made to be better than the movie before it, but this one almost went a step backwards in comparison to the second film. Less action, villain was stupid with the whole paid actor bit. They keep trying to find more creative ways for the suit to be put on, but I thought they should have just left it like they put it on in the first Iron Man. My vote for biggest disappointment of the summer thus far. Especially after Marvel put out a great movie like the Avengers, I can't believe the first follow up to that was this poorly written and lack of action movie.",1,21,36,7 May 2013
