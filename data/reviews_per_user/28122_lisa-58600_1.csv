The Lobster," Horrendous Animal Cruelty
","Horrenduous Animal Cruelty in the movie. Whether it was fake or not - I do not wish to see this. Even after researching it is not transparent whether this was actually fake or not. Whilst I agree that animals can be trained to do many things, I am also not as naive as to believe that a simple law will put an end to it. There is still a very long way to go in this regard.Suffering of animals should NEVER be used as entertainment. Not even as show. I stopped watching the movie after those scenes, which I could very well have lived without.There should be a warning in the beginning of movies advising of such scenes so that it can be avoided to watch them.Seeing as I had to walk out after those cruel and unnecessary scenes I cannot comment much on the rest of the film - which is a shame.",1,8,11,4 September 2016
