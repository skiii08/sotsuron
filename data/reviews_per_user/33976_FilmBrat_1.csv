The Blair Witch Project," A brilliant scary movie that you must keep reminding yourself it's just a movie
","This movie will keep people from camping in the woods the way Jaws kept people from the beach. The best part is the fact that the scariest moments are the ones you're not seeing. The cast is amazing and completely believable. I never want to be as terrified as they become. It is hard to remember that this is just a movie. The beginning takes off a little slow, but once it turns to night...be afraid. be very afraid.",10,1,2,16 June 1999
