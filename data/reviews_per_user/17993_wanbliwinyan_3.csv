Child 44," Extraordinary Movie
","We went to see Child 44 opening weekend. We were sent to a theatre in the back of the cinema. There were four people in the entire theatre. What a shame ~ and shame on whomever was in charge of promoting this movie. They truly fell on their face/faces. Child 44 was beautifully filmed ~ the scenery was breath taking ~ Sets were exceptionally well done...Tom Hardy was at his best as always...Another favorite of mine Joel Kinneman (sp?)was exceptional...as was Gary Oldman, though his screen presence was limited. All of the actors and actresses did a splendid job. I have little understanding as to why the promotion of this movie was so neglected. I seldom read reviews, but I read a couple and wonder if the reviewers actually watched this movie. Everyone did a splendid job ~ I highly recommend Child 44",10,88,142,4 May 2015
Cold Mountain," Breathtaking
","I was not prepared the first time I saw ColdMountain for the stunning performances, the 'breathtaking scenery,' and lastly the muscial score is beautiful. The performances by 'all,' are exceptional. Nicole Kidman is so adorable as Ada...Inman of course I am in love. Renes' performance speaks for itself. Her comic relief was great. There was no small roll in this movie... Applause to Jack White for his film debut as wellI wait with baited breath for the DVD.Sincerely, Linda Hayes",10,1,1,7 March 2004
Burlesque," Amazing
","In brief, I will say that this was a beautifully filmed movie, the sets and costumes are outstanding...the music phenomenal...I bought the sound track right after I left the theater..I loved the sub plot...girl makes good in big city, girl finds love...Reminiscent of those great old musicals of the 40's. If the writer, director or producers weren't aiming for that...well they accidentally hit a gusher, because that was one of the things I found so endearing about the movie...There was no part too big or too small, all the actors shined in my opinion...Young women and old sighed at the site of Cam Giagandets gorgeous body and million dollar smile....I am going back for seconds...Superb movie Cher, keep them coming...You are a treasure...",10,3,6,7 December 2010
