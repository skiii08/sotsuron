Scarface," Pre-Miami Vice
","Scarface came out one year before Miami Vice, and it is a very clear influence. The expensive suits, cars, the beautiful women, and especially the synth pop (by Giorgio Moroder in Scarface, Jan Hammer in Miami Vice) and obviously the subtropical Miami setting. I had never seen this movie in full, but it was great. It did seem odd to see so many now famous non-Cuban actors dressed up as Cubans, when there were so many Latino actors out there, even in 1983. Only Steven Bauer is the real deal. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was hot, which I never suspected. And Al Pacino can't dance to safe his life. Anyway, this is a very influential movie. The ending is predictable, and you have to wonder - doesn't anyone ever just retire and move into legitimate business?",8,0,1,21 August 2005
Dawn of the Dead," Pretty Good Genre Movie
","DAWN OF THE DEAD starts of as Shawn Of The Dead 2, way too comical and off the cuff. However, once characters are established, the movie quickly becomes far more involving. Camera work is used very effectively to create tension. Tension is also helped by the fact that the characters aren't asked to do too many stupid things, which always undermines the credibility and tension of the movie - you start to figure they deserve whatever they get.The cast is excellent, from Sarah Polley (Go), to Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phiffer, the great Jake Weber ('Medium', The Cell), Micheal Kelly and a very hot Kim Poirier (and born in the eighties too, how time flies). Sarah Polley alternatingly looks like Anna Faris and, for those of us who remember the eighties, Joanne Whalley ('Edge Of Darkness').Even though the entire Zombie theme has been done to death, there are some very real improvements made in this movie, and some incoherences too. For instance, none of the survivors have seen a zombie movie before (which is odd, as they're starring in one). Also, they are in a mall - plenty of food and water, but no gun shop? No fresh clothes? An improvement over earlier versions is the sheer number of zombies. Odds are stacked against the main characters too, because the zombies only have to wound them, while they have to shoot them in the head or decapitate them. The zombies have also gone from lumbering corpses, to being able to run at full speed. They're still telekinetic, as thousands of them seem to detect the presence of live humans and congregate on their hideouts.Considering that the first zombie movie of the modern movie era, Night Of The Living Dead, was made in 1968 (when most of the actors were either in being born or unborn for years to come), the movie holds up pretty well, and is still a vehicle through which to examine modern society, as it was then. And of course it is impossible to watch this movie and not think of Hurricane Katrina, which struck a year after this movie was made.",8,0,1,25 August 2006
Alien: Resurrection," Aliens IV (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)
","Having just watched Aliens: Resurrection, I was reasonable impressed. The makers had enough new ideas to justify making another sequel. You see, sequels aren't that bad if they create a new story, a movie that can stand on it's own.They almost succeeded with Resurrection. Ripley is older (48), but still strangely attractive. Being a part Alien hybrid this time around, she is also a lot meaner, although not enough in my book. I would have liked to see more of her vicious side, because a bad good guy/gal would have really spiced things up. Turning the obligatory cold, calculating and logical android (in previous movies played by Ian Holm and Lance Henriksen) into cute, emotional, cuddly  but physically just as tough Wynona Ryder, is a new touch too. A touch that shows some evolution in thinking of what future computers and robots are going to be like - after all the first movie was made in 1979. There are some gross-out moments when Ripley discovers her mutant siblings, showing a side to cloning no one will easily forget (although for an experiment set in the future, it looks awfully crude - don't they have better control of genetics 200 years from now?).The problem comes with the structure of the story. The story is really simple. Rogue captain Dan Hedaya is conducting experiments in 'restricted space' to clone alien-human hybrid Ripley and bring a few of the critters back to planet earth. Michael Wincott and his crew of space pirates come across the ship, mess around and kill much of the crew. Then, and this is where the movie really lets you down, it becomes a 'let's get to the shuttle before the aliens get us' routine that-we've-seen-in-every-single-rendition-of-this-franchise. And some more movies like Pitch Black with Vin Diesel. Why do script writers find it so difficult to write a new, interesting ending to their movies? That's the major problem. The race for the capsule is almost as big a cliché as the shootout.See it if you love the previous movies, and if not see it for free on cable for some cheap thrills.",Null,0,0,27 July 2003
Elizabeth," Visually Stunning
","This is a very stylefully shot, beautiful period piece directed by renowned Indian film maker Shekhar Kapur (also check out his Bandit Queen and Four Feathers). It is also slightly empty, however it gives a nice overview of England's teenaged warrior queen (I guess - don't ask me about historical factuality in regards to Elizabethan England).The story is pretty straightforward - a teenage girl must grow up superfast to survive a fiercely disputed crown and traitorous court. No one expects her to live long enough to become an effective monarch, but she still makes it through.Jeffrey Rush is pretty good as the coldblooded Sir Francis Walsingham. The movie makes it seem that without him, England would have been a Catholic country, which I guess is an interesting idea to contemplate.One favorite standout is French actress Fanny Ardant, showing that even at 49, she is HOT. Together with Monica Belluci's hubby Vincent Cassel, they make a very fine comical pair of wannabe pretenders to the throne of England.",Null,0,0,5 March 2004
Blade," Powerful
","This is a great addition to the vampire mythos, based on the comic strip with the same name, and featuring Wesley Snipes as the super tough part vampire, part man. There are lots of great special effects (especially the vampire explosions and the shower of blood scene) and Wesley Snipes has some pretty good martial arts moves.Lots of neat inventions to put the vampires into the modern era - they can get around in daylight by putting on heavy suits, motorcycle helmets and sunblocker.   If there is something bad to say about this entertaining action/horror movie, it is that it thin on plot. I also didn't like the acting of N'Bush Wright. She seemed to sulk throughout this movie, as if it was beneath her to play an ordinary action heroine. It's as if feminism has made these girlies allergic to real men. Yuck. There is a great rap song from Mystikal about Blade.",Null,0,1,24 September 2003
Alexander," Mnemonic Gardens of Vanity
","Where to begin, where to end? Here is a racial analysis of Oliver's project. The problem started in Anthony Hopkins' little racist and historically inaccurate mnemonic garden, situated in Egypt of course, and decorated by Rider Haggard. As this little tableau is supposed to be what Europe was to become more than what it was, the historical anachronisms are a given, and every stereotype is included.In this 19th Century American fantasy, Black people (literally) bow their heads to the wisdom of the broad-sculled Greeks. Didn't 'Old Ptolemy' know that, as Plato wrote in the Timaeus, the Egyptian priests called the Greeks 'but children in the mysteries'? And who is taking notes (literally) from this wise, Nordic Greek, but an Italian scribe (the Romans).Then, there are the scores of *blond* Greek children, enthusiastically playing at killing each other, like so many Hitler Youths.Alexander's mother is a dark skinned Greek, and therefore brilliant but fiery and emotionally unstable. His father Philip, played by a heavy set Val Kilmer, looks like Little John in Robin Of Sherwood, always drunk or ready to fight, or both. Top of the morning to you too, Phil.This is the Herrenvolk/master race reading of Greek history, where Greece was first populated by blonde, Viking like invaders from the Northeast.The historical inaccuracy of including the Lighthouse of Pharos (not completed until the reign of Ptolemy II), likely for rhetorical purposes, has been mentioned elsewhere.The thing with mnemonic gardens is that they are supposed to become part of your memory, indelibly inscribed for future use. I would pass on that, thank you.What is left is a terrible script, historical inaccuracies and good actors trying to save the movie and failing *cough* heroically.Maybe Las Vegas can turn it into a musical. See JFK instead. ;\",4,1,4,28 June 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," Below Average Disaster Movie
","Some interesting scenes, but mostly this apocalyptic mess fails as an entertaining movie.Seventies disaster movies meet global warming. As you can expect, this is a movie where contrived rescue missions and horrible acting meet relentless demographic scanning.Almost all the Black characters in here are geeks, Emmy Rossum ('Mystic River') continually has this crazy eyed expression, Jake Gyllenhaal's 'cute' acting is getting boring really quickly and is strictly aimed at teen-aged girls, and the Dennis Quaid/Harrison Ford role is a little too 'heroic' and unthinking at the same time.To top it all off, two regulars from the '24' TV series are in there, AND the lead character is called 'Jack'.The plot devices come on heavy and strong. You cringe, every time someone suggests 'let's take the plane' or 'let's take the train'. Of course Jack's son is in Manhattan. Of course Jack will try and walk there, even though we have just seen seasoned RAF pilots turn into popsicles in the blink of an eye. You cringe when Emmy Rossum risks her life to retrieve a passport, even though a 100 foot wall of water is raging toward her. She survives by walking up a flight of stairs, of course, otherwise the love interest would have disappeared from the story. And what would a movie about the next ice age be without a love interest.Like so many movies, this one started off as a good idea, and the movie was sort of organized around that idea. As a result, no one managed to stop and think about a plot.Recommended only if you are a hardcore disaster movie fan and want to be able to say 'I have seen them all'.",6,1,3,24 November 2005
A Bridge Too Far," One of the greatest war movies of all time
","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD**To me, A Bridge Too Far is one of the most memorable movies ever made, because the landscape of the eastern/central Netherlands is so much etched into my consciousness. Even though the western and northern parts (the parts below sea level) are (sea) clay and rich, the eastern part is higher and therefore so sandy that only pines and heather will grow on it. This is the landscape in which much of operation Market Garden was fought out. Market Garden is of course the story of the Allied assault across Holland's rivers, which if successful, would have allowed the allies occupy the Ruhr region of Germany, it's industrial heartland, stopping the nazi war machine from re-supplying it's tank, airforce and infantry units with much needed replacement parts, ammunition, etc. If successful, it would have ended the war there and then. In the end, the Allies made it all the way to Nijmegen, but failed to secure the last bridge at Arnhem, heroically defended by the British paras (I'm getting steamed up just writing about it), who were overwhelmed because contrary to allied command's     assertions, there were SS panzer units still active in the area. The bridge they defended has been renamed the John Frost Bridge (the character in the movie played by Anthony Hopkins). In the end, the people of the Netherlands payed a heavy price as well, because after the railway strike in support of Market Garden, German command stopped the supply of food and fuel to the west of the Netherlands, resulting in a famine which took 18,000 lives during the worst winter in living memory. As a movie, this is a tour de force, with airial landings to rival anything The Longest Day or Band Of Brothers. An all star cast is used effectively to differentiate the many units and commanders. Standouts however, are Anthony Hopkins, Robert Redford, Dirk Bogarde, Edward Fox, but especially Sean Connery, as Scottish para major-general Roy Urquhart. If I had any problem, it's with the dutch people being played by international actors Laurence Olivier (although he is pretty good of course), but especially Liv Ullman as Kate ter Horst (her Dutch is nearly completely unintelligeble, even after repeated listening). Giving credit where it is due, outstanding performances are also Hardy Krüger as SS major-general Ludwig and Maximilian Schell (The Iron Cross) as Lt.-General Bittrich. This is not a perfect movie by any means, but it is one of the greatest movies ever made, certainly one of the greatest war movies. Don't miss it.",8,1,2,6 June 2002
Hotel Rwanda," Some Comments
","A lot has already been said about Hotel Rwanda. Don Cheadle stands out as always, because he is one of the greatest actors of his generation - right up there with Jeffrey Wright and John Seymour Hoffman. Therefore, I only have a few points to add.<ul><li>The name of the movie is a play on Rwanda's other name, the 'Land Of A Thousand Hills', or in French, 'Pays des Milles Collines'. The refugees are housed in the Milles Collines Hotel, or Thousand Hills Hotel. Therefore, Hotel Rwanda.</li></ul><ul><li>The cast, although often excellent, is miscast because they are not Rwandans. In fact, half the cast have Zulu/Nguni clan surnames (Dube, Ndlovu, Sithole, Khumalo, etc.). I imagine it was filmed in South Africa? Durban, perhaps? :) This makes the comparison between Hutus and Tutsis a bit irrelevant though. Sophie Okonedo is not a Tutsi, but biracial and Nigerian/English. This is a minor point and not to disparage her acting achievement, but with the repeated statements that Tutsis have 'lighter skin' or 'longer noses' etc., it actually plays into the misconception of the 'difference' between Hutus and Tutsis.</li></ul><ul><li>The Hamitic Race Theory, which is at the basis of the original discrimination by Belgian or German authorities is not clearly spelled out. It is not only applicable to Rwanda, but also to the present conflict in Western Sudan (Darfur). The pro-government militias are portrayed as 'white Arabs', horse or camel riding, where the population of Darfur is portrayed as 'Black African', and sometimes even Christian and Animist. This is the revisiting of the once extremely widespread Hamitic Race Theory, the theory that maintained that all culture in not only Africa, but Asia and the Americas should be explained by the diffusion of a mythical white race (which could be Black, Asian or Native American looking whenever it had to be). At one time, anthropologists tried to find the remnants of this race of 'blackened whites'. In some regions like South Africa, this theory is still taught in schools. Any nomadic, tall, cattle herding people (like the Masai, the Dinka or similar people) were classified non-Black and Hamitic and superior to the agricultural population of 'true Negroes'. The fact that 'superior' herders had the worst land, and 'inferior' farmers had the best land, which white settlers coveted, was of course an added bonus and an extra assurance of the popularity of the theory. Masai good, Kikuyu bad. Tutsi good, Hutu bad. Etcetera, because this kind of schism was repeated all over colonial Africa. People with bad land were pronounced to be 'superior', and people with good land were classified 'inferior', without any sense or irony or contradiction. This also has to do with the way colonialism functioned, which was no different than the way the Romans governed their newly gained territories - divide and conquer. A minority was picked out and proclaimed to be 'superior', and they were given privileges (education abroad, positions in local government, they were allowed to keep some land) and used to govern over the majority.</li></ul>Don't believe everything you hear on TV, but do your own research. The literature is there for all to read.",7,0,0,31 July 2006
We Were Soldiers," Plei Ku, Blood & Guts
","This is a movie that is terribly conflicted. On the one hand, it wants to show the realities of war, both in it's effects on the soldiers at the front, and the loved ones they leave behind. On the other, this post-911 production wants to do nothing more than to wave the stars and stripes, going to almost ridiculous extents. There is ample use of WWII era Hollywood cliches in this movie.Let's begin with the videocover/poster for this movie. Mel Gibson looks so mean and intense that he's almost caught a second before spitting out a big wad of Redman's. Hilarious, leaning towards high camp.The dying soldier's 'Please tell my wife, I love her' has already been mentioned.Then there is the Sam Elliott's super-gruff sergeant in charge ('Good morning, sergeant'. Reply: 'How the f*** do you know what kind of morning it's going to be?').And then there is the title. 'We Were Soldiers' is a lot more assertive than the original, more melancholy title, 'We Were Soldiers Once, And Young'.And lastly, there is the misplaced sounding Scottish music, that seems to want to create a connection in the viewer between this movie and 'Braveheart', Mel Gibson's other epic about bloodshed and heroism.However, all this said, the battle at Pleiku was most definitely a historical one. It set the US military doctrine of the use of airmobile units, and created a battle which the high command (General Westmoreland) more than anything wished to emulate over and over. The reason was that it resulted in a 'kill ratio' of about 40 to 1. For every US soldier killed, 40 Vietnamese died. Eerily enough, it is also the death toll/ratio for the entire war (58,000 American deaths for 2,000,000 Vietnamese deaths). The battle at Pleiku started off America's serious involvement in the war in 1965, which until then had only been fought by the proxy use of Special Forces 'advisors', and which would only end 8 years later in 1973, making it America's longest war by far.So in summation, it started of the US's involvement in Vietnam, and also set the official military doctrine that would haunt the conflict for it's duration - a mobile conventional helicopter war, attempting to draw out the Vietnamese regular forces into a confrontation in which US air and artillery power would win the day. During the Tet offensive of 1968, Westmoreland was still waiting for a Vietnamese all-out assault. On the other hand, you can argue that the 40-1 kill ratio set the objective in the Vietnamese military's mind for the need to close that gap - kill more Americans and hide their own deaths as much as possible.What is also clear from the movie, is what a waste war is and how criminal it is to fight things out on the battle field, when the obvious solution is political and economic. There was a, perhaps understandable, misreading of the nature and desires of Ho Chi Min, and the old Vietminh freedom fighters. There was also not enough effort to distance themselves from the old colonial legacy left by France and England, especially in their backing of the old exploitative, feudal system and their a priori failure to support or introduce transparent, democratic government. At the same time, seeing the enormity of Vietnamese sacrifice, it is hard not to consider how well the South Koreans have done out of compliance with the USA. In short, the issues that were thrown up during the Vietnam conflict would never be addressed on the battlefield, and the battle at Pleiku set the stage for the military conflicts to come. To understand what went wrong by an over reliance on waiting for the Vietcong to come to them, and why going after the Vietcong without proper intelligence was like catching fish with a spoon, read 'Slow Burn' by Orrin DeForest, 'A Vietcong Memoir' by Troung Nhu Tang or 'Stalking the Vietcong' by Stuart Herrington.All said, a pretty good war movie.",Null,1,2,12 December 2002
Glory," First attempt, but how many are to follow?
","Glory could have been a great movie, but with Edward Zwick as director, it would have been too much to ask for the same guts in battling stereotypes as the soldiers of the 54th put up in trying to conquer Fort Wagner. As a Black man (well mixed-race actually), I had the following observations about Glory.I very much dislike the term 'freed slave', for the following two reasons:a) There is no such thing as a 'freed slave'. A man is either free, and he isn't a slave, or he is a slave, and he isn't free. It's an oxymoron, and I prefer the term 'ex-slave', which is at least has the benefit of being accurate.b) It puts white folks in the driver's seat as actors of freeing 'these people' who miraculously have found themselves to be slaves, somehow. On the contrary, many Africans in America freed themselves; they ran away, to the extent that not a week went by without southern newspapers running ads for runaway slaves; they bought their own freedom or had parents who did; they were or had parents who had been granted their freedom in through their owners' wills; they already lived as free men, whether in Canada, the north or even south.It panders to the Margaret Mitchell view of slavery, where all slaves were picking cotton on large plantations and were just going along with the system until the had freedom declared upon them. Many were engineers, builders, horsemen, domestics, etc. who in fact build and conserved much of the south.However, it most poignantly doesn't break with the Hollywood cliche of a white man coming in and teaching black people how to stand up for themselves (yeah, right!). It is the same as Mario van Peebles found in his attempt to get funding for 'Panthers' (can't we get a white guy to teach the Black Panthers how to shoot and defend themselves?).In the end, the director didn't, as always happens, trust the audience to look at this as a great story and just 'get it', without having to be helped along, or having artificial characters inserted to look down on or identify with, and that's this movie's tragedy. Morgan Freeman is great as usual, but his telling Denzel Washington to cool his heels too easily makes him look like an Uncle Tom. Denzel, on the other hand, is too easily cast as the Irrational Negro (like sometimes Miguel Nunez in Tour Of Duty), and the scene where he is whipped and a big, rolling tear runs down his face if _over the top_. The most offensive character is Jimhi Kennedy's bumpkin soldier.Personally, I couldn't wait for the preliminaries to be over and get to the combat scenes, which are the savior of this movie. Usually, army units only have one movie dedicated to them (the British Paras had 'A Bridge Too Far', the US Army's Mobile Picture Unit had '84 Charlie Mopic', etc.). It would be a shame if this was the only movie about the brave 54th Massachusetts Infantry.",Null,1,3,25 October 2001
The Aviator," Howard Hughes: Descent Into Madness
","Martin Scorcese directed Howard Hughes as a cross between Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas in 'Wall Street') and Mr. Monk. Does he get away with it? The movie makers can't seem to decide whether Howard Hughes was a germophobe, suffering from autism or from obsessive compulsive disorder. What they leave out is the addiction to amphetamines and morphine. Scorcese left out a lot of other things too, like the pervasive anti-Black racism and anti-Semitism of the time and the place, including Hughes', just as Scorcese left out the fact that 'Gangs Of New York' was essentially about a Civil War era anti-Black race riot. Scorcese also left out Howard Hughes' role in the communist witch hunts of the 1950s, instead portraying him as being the victim of a vindictive and corrupt senator (Alan Alda). Like the racism of the time, the movie forgets to mention Hughes' rabid anti-communism, his firing of a blacklisted writer and his suppression of the pro-labor movie 'Salt Of The Earth'. The fact that one of Hughes' passenger planes crashes (undoubtedly killing all on board) is mentioned and forgotten, and almost seems to be justified by the fact that Hughes himself frequently crashes his own planes. Unlike in the movie, the real Howard was not born poor to a hygiene obsessed mother (in real life, he actually contracted syphillis, decades before there was a cure for it), but to a father who left him a fortune and an engineering business. The truth is that Howard Hughes was a rich boy and elitist oligarch, and that the fortune his father made selling a unique oil drill bit in Houston was against the background of Black disenfranchisement, including land theft, in Texas. Hughes made 'Hells Angels' during the early 1920s, a time when the klan was reaching its highpoint of popularity, was even finding a willing ear in the White House, and saw the burning down and mass murder of highly successful Black communities in Oklahoma City, Kansas City and other towns by resentful Whites. The only hints of racism come from the all White minstrels doing some kind of exhalted 'race music' dance. Why only hint? Because giving us a picture of the real Howard Hughes would have left the movie without a sympathetic lead. Beside being a racist and anti-Semite, Hughes was also a rapist and a bisexual, the former only hinted at by Leonardo DiCaprio's sweet come-on to a surprisingly willing waitress in a restaurant. I guess those were the perks of wealth in the 1920s. Scorcese's treatment of the Hepburn family, who were social reformers and socialists, also warrants mention. They are portrayed as stuck up champaign socialists, when in fact they were actively campaigning for women's right to vote, and were friends and supporters of Emma Goldman. Perhaps someone as rich as Howard Hughes could afford not to notice The Great Depression, but that is no excuse for Martin Scorcese to do the same. The start of WWII is not dealt with. Hughes support for the overthrow of Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution, or his ties to the CIA are not mentioned either. Now about the movie. Everyone seems to have wanted to be part of this production. Kate Blanchett, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Jude Law, Kate Beckinsale, Willem Dafoe, Gwen Stefani, with Martin Scorcese directing and Michael Mann producing. I'm sure they thought they were in for a rip-roaring tale of great wealth, Hollywood glamor and cutting edge airoplanes, and they were. The flight scenes are exciting and spectacular (including the crashes). I give this movie 8 stars out of 10, not for Howard Hughes, but for Leonardo DiCaprio and the movie, which although long, never fails to capture your attention and tells a rather sympathetic, though fictional, tale.",8,0,2,19 February 2006
The Bourne Identity," We've Been Here Before
","The problem with The Bourne Identity is that we've seen it all before, and done much better. We also have been spoiled by ten years of X-Files episodes, which have pretty much explored every horror theme and conspiracy theory out there.Knowing that, The Bourne Identity could have been saved (like xXx, Mission Impossible) by _original_ action scenes and stunts, and by a main character who has a much more ambiguous look than Matt Damon. Damon is simply way too pretty and bland to hold your interest for very long. Franka Potente, likewise, is attractive, but in a bland, sturdy, Germanic way.I dozed off half way through, woke up again and saw the second half of the movie another day. The problem is, I hadn't missed much if anything. The story could be picked up just as well with half of the movie missing - not a good sign for a thriller or spy movie.They had the budget, they had lots of sort of interesting locations (Italy and France are no longer as exotic as they were 50 years ago, when no one traveled very much.), they had some stars.A major issue is that the theme is not outlandish or involving enough to capture your attention. He's a spy/assassin, something went wrong on his mission, and now someone is trying to kill him. Huh? Really? Who could it be? Who cares? I mean, would your life be improved if you found out? Is it really worth over 1 1/2 hours looking at Matt Damon looking puzzled? The sparks between Damon and Potente aren't exactly flying either. And Brian Cox is now so much associated with low budget movies that I dread every time he appears on the screen. (With the exception of The 25th Hour of course - in which he actually got to act.)

Van Helsing," The X-Men meet Aliens and Frankenstein
","Can you say 'derivative'? Not that that is always bad, sometimes something new and original rolls out. However...Van Helsing is a run of the mill fantasy/horror movie that tries and fails to be a horror/comedy as well.Although this is a very staid genre, here, The X-Men meet Aliens and a host of other Gothic stories and concepts, mainly Frankenstein. The James Bond take on a 19th century vampire hunter was unique, but flowed out of the whole X-Men vibe the movie had. Van Helsing is stuck with his own version of Q, a friar who makes undead killing weaponry.When a secret order of the church, Van Helsing's regular employers, get word that one of their Transsylvanian vampire hunting families is in trouble, Van Helsing is dispatched to that far and strange place of the mind. After making a deal with the devil or the church, centuries ago the family promised that until they killed Dracula, none of their deceased ancestors could enter heaven.Meanwhile, Dracula is busy employing the services of dr. Frankenstein, to create an electric elixir of life that will allow his manifold scions to live. These baby vampires, you see, have a tendency to just blow up in a messy goo whenever they get ready to make their first kill. As this won't do, and I guess Dracula is tired of reproducing by just biting people, he gets dr. Frankenstein to make the Monster of Frankenstein, run huge amounts of electricity through it and, miraculously transfer the proper life force to his Aliens-like brood. The villagers meanwhile are wholly unaware of this new development, as they are more than happy to let Dracula and his three 'brides' suck the life out of one or two of their kin every month. The number of these potential new vampires is enormous, and you have to wonder whether Dracula didn't have the foresight to see that this would lead to a huge vampire overpopulation problem. Who are they going to suck blood out of? They would depopulate all of Rumania. Anyway, I, like the movie, digress...This is not the very worst horror movie ever made. However, the jokes fall flat, and you have to like Hugh Jackman (I don't). Also, Kate Beckinsale seems a little underpowered in her vampire fighting pirate queen outfit. However the worst I guess are the British accents of the Transsylvanian villagers, which, alongside the CGI laden sets, never let you forget that this is a British studio production. An homage to the Hammer days is one thing, making a good movie out of this is another.(I liked Sleepy Hollow with Johnnie Depp and Christina Ricci better.

","Cross of Iron is the brutal tale by Sam Peckinpah, of a small platoon of German troopers lost behind Russian lines. James Coburn, James Mason, Maximilian Schell and David Warner shine as the seasoned troopers trying to get through another day at the front. Their survival is threatened by the aristocratic Schell's need to return home having been awarded the Iron Cross. He won't let anything come between him and his objective his ambition, not even the appearance of cowardice. Through his scheming, Coburn's platoon isn't notified when the Russians engage in a major offensive, and they're forced to try to survive and make it back safe to their own lines. This is a gruesome tour de force, and Peckinpah really does deliver on the promise of his reputation. The sense or realism is increased by the fact that most of the minor characters are actually German or Yugoslav. The Partisan chicks are pretty hot though. :-) One of the ultimate WWII movies, and unique because it (tries to) shows the war from a German perspective.",Null,2,3,6 June 2002
Pearl Harbor," Done before, but has redeeming points
","Pearl Harbor isn't really that bad a movie. Yes, it is far too referential about the Hollywood and WWII clichés. Yes, the most important attack upon the US during WWII is wrapped around a love story and the lifes of two farmboys is a backstory that goes on far too long and doesn't really get to the hart of Pearl Harbor - it would have been better if they'd focused on the political developments and intelligence failures that preceded it. Yes, this movie was written by the same guy (Randall Wallace) who gave us Braveheart and We Were Soldiers (notice how similar wifes/love-interests Madeleine Stowe and Kate Beckinsale look). And yes, there is some painful dialogue (especially Nicholas Farrell as the RAF officer - he looked like he was drowning his distaste for the lines he had to say in a pint of beer).However, when all is said and done, you're left with a pretty well done yarn, nothing great, three attractive leads. Although with a budget like this, I guess much of the disappointment comes from the producers not paying more attention to the storyline and the script. One problem is that because so many movies have been made about world war 2 over the last half century, it is difficult to avoid the clichés (the conflicted love story, the dead soldier who really isn't, even the stammering guy to whom it falls to announce the Japanese attack, although that _is_ pretty funny - you've seen it all ten times before).The battle scenes however are very good. But, as this movie is intended to lift spirits, it can't be just about the kicking the US Navy received during Pearl Harbor (like for instance A Bridge Too Far is just about Market Garden). So, the Doolittle Raid is tacked on, taking up the last half hour, allowing Alec Baldwin to reprise his role from Glengarry Glen Ross.What is also good about this movie is that it shows at least two Japanese Americans working for the US military and also includes the story of Dorie Miller, a Black sailor who without specific training manned his ship's machine gun and shot down 6 Japanese bomber planes (3 of which were officially acknowledged), at a time when the Navy tried to keep Black troops out of active service.",Null,0,0,1 March 2003
Tigerland," Boring
","I was really looking forward to watching this, because I enjoy Vietnam War movies. However, this is just Full Metal Jacket's training sequence with Platoon's plot grafted on.This story of an infantry platoon or company going through Advanced Infantry Training (the Tigerland of the title) is strung together by unlikelihoods and cliches and as a result, it's as _boring_ as you'd expect getting ready for war would be.   'Tigerland' is supposed to be really tough, but that somehow never registers on either the writers or the viewer. It looks like just more training. So what? Another thing is that the standards for preparation for movies like this has risen and risen - the main protagonist looks like he doesn't know how to even hold a rifle. Lots of series have real military people prepare the actors (Daly Dye and his work for 84 Charlie Mopic, Tour Of Duty, etc. comes to mind) - I wonder whether this was the case for Tigerland. Anyway, it didn't live up to the hype. Or the video cover.",Null,0,1,2 September 2002
Saving Private Ryan," The Spielberg Touch?
","SPR is really two movies, the one gutsy and innovative, the other improbable and in need of much suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer. The first twenty minutes of SPR deal with the realities of the landing on Normandy Beach, by the elite US Army Rangers. This is the movie with the level of gore and computer pyrotechnics that Hollywood, as part WWII war propaganda machine was totally unwilling, let alone incapable of showing. This was what was missing from a half century of war movies. The gruesome nature of true combat, the psychological effect on even trained soldiers are impeccably portrayed. On the other hand, after the landing has been achieved, we're thrown into a platoon of Rangers who are saddled with the unlikely task of locating a trooper (private Ryan) because all his brothers have already been killed. Although the movie now and then returns to it's war movie roots, the premise is so unlikely as to lose the viewer. Certainly the second half isn't living up to the first.Still recommended.",Null,0,0,6 June 2002
Beasts of No Nation," War Porn
","The problem with Beasts Of No Nation is a problem familiar with all depictions of Africa - the absence of any kind of context.Things happen for no reason, allowing the viewer to fill in the blanks with previous propaganda, making the viewer believe that their previous misconceptions have now been confirmed.Beasts Of No Nation was made by Cary Joji Fukunaga, a Rockefeller Foundation Fellow. The Rockefellers own among the world's largest extractive industry corporations owners/founders - ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhilips, United Fruit/Chiquita, and many more. A similar family started Royal Dutch Shell, which exploits the people of Nigeria for their oil.Which brings me to the decontextualization - this story is set 'in a fictional African country', however the writer of the book is a Nigerian national. If the Idris Alba character would have been working for someone, it would have been Shell, maybe Anglo-Ashanti Gold, or his direct superiors would have been working on their behalf.This is lost in the war porn, as it always is. Because Beasts Of No Nation is just one in a long line of 'mood setting' rather than informative movies about Africa, all of which are funded by the same extractive industry corporations and the families that own them.Blood Diamonds was made on behalf of the Kimberley Process, which tried to restrict diamond exports from Zimbabwe and the Congo DRC. It was driven by Nicky Oppenheimer of Anglo-American De Beers, the world's diamond monopolist in the 20th century, and even today the world's biggest diamond miner with 40% of global diamonds mined and traded.The Interpreter, with Nicole Kidman, another movie 'set in a fictional African country', however clearly based on Zimbabwe, where De Beers covets the huge Chiadzwa and Marange diamond fields, which could supply 20% of the world's diamond supply and crash the world's diamond price. Mugabe And The White African is in a similar vein, trying to demonize the government of Zimbabwe, while extolling the virtues of Rhodesia.Then of course there was the propaganda of Eve Ensler, trying to hyper-focus the destruction of Eastern DRC by the Rwandan government's M-23, into 'the Vagina Monologues'. Again, leaving the actual culprits out of the picture, and focusing on mercenaries/soldiers and war porn instead.De Beers lost 117,000 hectares of land in the land redistribution of 2000, and they want it back. And if that means portraying Africans as psychotic 'Beasts Of No Nation', well that's what they've been doing for over 100 years.",4,34,71,13 February 2016
Rules of Engagement," Manipulative
","Having just watched Rules Of Engagement, I have to say that although Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones are a joy to watch, I have to make some negative comments about this movie.The movie is extremely manipulative, and comes from the equally manipulative director of The French Connection, William Friedkin. The movie's bad guys, oddly enough, are a crowd of irrational arabs, together with career politicians who won't just let military men do what they have to do.The problem with the entire scenario is that the entire massacre could have been prevented with a couple of well aimed teargass grenades. Secondly, not a lot of time is spent on the character development of the 'bad guys', namely the Yemenis (in this case), who all seem to be very eager to die killing Americans, including their (the Yemeni's) toddlers. The later images of the little girl shooting a pistol is very manipulative indeed ('oh, see, she deserved to get her leg shot off after all!').And thirdly, the incident most like it, namely the US Army Rangers debacle in Mogadishu, caused the death of 18 Rangers but 1000 Somali Mogadishuans, most of which were non-combatants. No-one seems to have been called to task for that event, let alone be thrown to the lions to appease public opinion, like Samuel Jackson's character is over a 'mere' 83 deaths. (The same thing can be said for the invasion of Panama, where there was a similar death toll among civilians - the truth of the matter is that since WWII, conventional weapons have become infinitely more efficient, with the result that if conflict breaks out in built-up areas, _lots_ of civilians are killed.)However, the one redeeming value (other than the acting) is that it shines a light on the changed nature of the political war that is required of the modern soldier in places like Somalia, Bosnia, etc., and that started in Vietnam.",Null,12,19,28 February 2002
Mulholland Drive," Tres David Lynch
","Mulholland Drive can be summed up in two words: David Lynch.The best thing about this are indeed Naomi Watts (the Patsy Kensit of the 00s) and Laura Harring, and their 'moments' together. If Naomi Watts never does anything else, she can use this movie as her resume, because she gets act pretty much any type there is.The problem with this movie isn't just that it leaves the average moviegoer wondering what happened. It's that it is way too easy to just throw this disjointed 'structure' at the audience. Of course, Lynch did all this before, especially in 'Lost Highway' with Balthazar Getty/Bill Pullman and to a lesser extent 'Blue Velvet' with Isabella Rossellini, Kyle MacLachlan and Dennis Hopper. Basically Lynch looks at an event from multiple angles and multiple time frames, and then throws in a lot of stuff that just happens inside the main character's head. In that sense, Mulholland Drive is most like Lost Highway.Does that make for a good movie? I don't think so. It is impossible to find a single sympathetic character in this mess. Because you don't care about the characters, it is hard to care about the movie as a whole. Or maybe I'm just not using the right drugs. I wonder what Lynch is on though.I really do like Naomi Watts though, and Laura Harring was a revelation.",Null,1,3,18 November 2004
The Last Samurai," Artistic License
","Oh dear. The Last Samurai, directed by Edward Zwick (of the equally problematic Glory, with Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman, as well as the prophetic Under Siege), has directed a movie that is a Hollywood gumbo of historical facts, romantic fabrication and artistic license.The main character, captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), is sent to Japan so his Indian wars AND civil war experience can be put to use, teaching the Japanese modern warfare.One problem is that Zwick plays havoc with the timeline. In one scene, Algren witnesses a samurai having his top knot cut off by a squad of Japanese soldiers in Western uniforms, to which his friend Simon Gray (Timothy Spall) says: 'It has begun'. This then must have been during the Meiji Restoration, when the Samurai lost their privileges, from 1866 to 1869, just after the American Civil War (which ended in 1865), during which the Samurai lost the privilege to wear their top knot and their two swords.However, Algren also claims to have been traumatized, fighting Indians under George Armstrong Custer, who was killed at the battle of Little Big Horn, in 1876, at least 7 years later.I have serious doubts that the Samurai versus modern army battle ever took place, and if it did, it certainly was not after 1876.Then, there is the unlikely Madam Butterfly romance between the Yankee soldier and the wife of the Samurai he killed. At one point, she asks for permission to kill herself. Wouldn't it have occurred to Algren's protector Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), that she may also try to kill him by slipping something into his food or the sake he drinks so much of? Oh and by the way, the Japanese had experience with firearms before. However, because of high casualty rate on both sides, which led to famine (most of the foot soldiers were farmers), they were banned.The movie does however give an accurate picture of how the new weapons (howitzers, machine guns, rifles) made a huge impact in warfare, and made 'modern' colonialism possible. It is no coincidence that colonialism came to it's high point (with the 1885 Vienna Conference) when these faster weapons made decisively defeating Native forces (Zulus, Native Americans, Indians) possible. The irony of course is that it were these weapons that came back to bite the West and destroy it only 40 years later, in Flanders fields.",7,0,1,15 June 2005
From Hell," Menace II Society 2: The Whitechapel Murders
","This is a bawdy tale of sex, drugs and satanism when syphilis was the AIDS of its day (antibiotics wouldn't be discovered for another 40 years or so).This is actually a pretty good serial killer procedural come social and historic commentary of London society at the height of Empire. And even the plot does get pulled together in the end.The Hughes Brothers have produced an ok movie. They always seem to be on the edge of greatness, without actually getting there. Their 'Dead Presidents' would have been outstanding, if it wasn't for the last 20 minutes.
Anyway, the problem with casting American actors with British accents is that they are faced with the double task of getting the tone and pitch right, while at the same time having to act. Some are great at this, while some never get it. Johnny Depp was good. Heather Graham on the other hand succeeded 60% of the way, but her restrained accent is contradicted by her overblown facial expressions. That's as precise as I can put it. She had been better off affecting an Irish accent, which is probably easier to do. Robbie Coltrane never lets go of his Scottish brogue, which of course never gets in the way of anything. London was a very international place at the time, and still is. Having gotten that off my chest, this is a pretty bloody movie, that also gives some insight into the lives of the prostitutes of the Whitechapel area. Also, the long running English obsession with the Freemasons is touched upon.",Null,1,2,15 August 2004
Mystic River," In Praise Of Lynch Law
","An expectedly reactionary piece of work from Clint Eastwood (of Dirty Harry fame). Mystic River (or is that Mastic River?) is a movie about an Irish American neighborhood of Boston. Three friends are torn apart by a traumatic event in their youth, but grow into middle age living in close proximity of each other. I agree that the acting is well done. I usually don't like Sean Penn or Tim Robbins, but in this movie their acting puts any previous performances to rest. The problem I have, is that according to the Laura Linney character (but it's really Clint speaking) that yeah, if you murder someone out of righteous revenge, and you KILL THE WRONG PERSON, that's OK, because you meant well. You have a big heart, you cared too much, bla, bla. Just drink a bottle of whiskey to show you're sorry, and you'll be okay, the cops will look the other way, etc. Small point - the pedophile that Tim Robbins beats to death is with his car. So how can he be filed as 'John Doe' in the morgue? How about license plates, drivers license, etc.",7,0,2,2 July 2005
Enemy at the Gates," Awkward
","Eastenders at war. Or so it sounds like during the first half of this movie, where even Bob Hoskins turns up as Nikita Khrushchev. It's really irritating that British movies and series often signpost the working class origin of Russian communists by giving them regional British accents. The problem with that is that regional accents are extremely peculiar to a specific region, and rather than make the actors sound more Russian or authentic, it grates and irritates and disorients. I never knew that Khrushchev was a Cockney. Also, Ron Perlman is dubbed over with what sounds like an Australian accent. G'day to you too, comrade. You can almost hear the producers think - we have to get an American actor in here, or it won't sell in the US. Which is ok, because none of them except a few extras are Russians anyway.
I find this really distracting, rather than 'authentic'. Their accents would have been less distracting if they'd been more neutral. The second half of the film focuses more on sniping and Ed Harris is pretty good as the German aristocrat sniper who is sent to take out Zaitsev. Finally a movie about WWII from the pov of the Russians, who took the brunt of the German assault and without whose resistance, WWII wouldn't have been won and nazism would have triumphed.",Null,0,1,6 September 2002
Man on Fire," The Revenge Of Creasy Bear
","What to say. This is a revenge flick that pretty much touches all bases. Traumatized and alcoholic special forces type Creasy gets a job through an old war buddy, babysitting little Dakota Fanning.Which is all cute enough, until she gets kidnapped violently, and Creasy is almost killed, but not before taking out four of the assailants. (Just a quip, but why isn't he wearing an armored vest?) Taking only a few days to recover from one shot in the arm and one shot to the torso, Creasy goes out to exact his own brand of vengeance.So far, so good.The problem comes when Denzel as an action hero does not seem to enjoy the usual perks that go with the role. One, why does he never get the girl (and no, I'm not suggesting any steamy love scenes between Denzel and Dakota - just any girl, really)? Two, why does he die in his own movie? There was no point to it. Bruce Willis gets to walk away at the end of all the Die Hard episodes - why not Denzel? There was no point to the exchange at the end of the movie. Sanchez just wanted his family back, he had the little girl, so swap them for each other. Why swap the little girl for Sanchez' family and Creasy as well?",7,1,2,15 February 2006
Downfall," Questions About Artistic Freedom And Integrity
","I feel quite ambivalent to the movie Der Untergang. On the one hand, there is a chilling realism in the way Hitler is portrayed by Bruno Ganz. The war wounds are realistic, unlike the usual Hollywood/War Department movie garbage. However, there are the apparent historical inaccuracies and cinematic devices. For instance...1) How innocent was Traudl Junge? Her birth name was Gertrude Humps (no pun intended), and she received the name Junge when she married *SS officer* Hans-Hermann Junge. Considering her age, mustn't she also have been a Jungmaedl (the girl equivalent of the Hitler Youth)? She refers to herself as 'not a fanatical nazi', but of course, she was a nazi nonetheless. People don't just end up employed in Adolf Hitler's bunker by accident. In the movie, she is taken aback by Hitler's anti-semitism, but she does have an apparent dislike of the Russians - whom the Nazis hated for the same insane and pseudoscientific racist reasons they hated Jews, Gypsies, and most Eastern Europeans. I don't know...2) At the end of the movie, we see Traudl Junge, played by the gorgeous Alexandra Maria Lara, make her escape by walking through a large group of Russian soldiers. My problem is that it was known that 'every woman in Berlin' was raped by Russian soldiers. So how did a gorgeous girl with huge eyes, wearing an army helmet with *SS* in huge markings on the side of it, make her way safely through a crowd of drunken, war weary and traumatized Russian troops? The little boy she takes off with didn't exist and is there as a cinematic device, signifying hope? Traudle Junge cycles off with him into the future, when in reality she was sent to a Russian prison camp. 3) How plausible is it that a top level nazi 'just didn't know'? I don't buy it. To quote Traudl Junge, 'We should listen to the voice of conscience. It does not take nearly as much courage as one might think to admit to our mistakes and learn from them. Human beings are in this world to learn and to change themselves in learning.' But the German Socialists knew the Nazis were scum - so did the Communists, Humanists, etc. I'm sure they didn't understand fully how crazy Hitler was, how far he would go in carrying out his ideas, etc. But they knew he was bad news, even back in the thirties. 4) The Timeline. Traudl Junge became Hitler's personal secretary in 1942, two years _before_ her SS officer husband was killed. And yet, she is presented as a wide eyed innocent, who doesn't really believe in nazism, and is picked by Hitler in the middle of the night, for no apparent reason. The movie never obviously flashes forward three years to Hitler's last hours in the bunker in 1945. I think the movie needed at least one sympathetic character, and either the director or Junge herself played up her innocence.",8,3,6,22 January 2006
Jaws," The Best
","JAWS may well be the ultimate horror movie. Made in 1975, it's hard to imagine that it's leanness hasn't influenced the the serial killer/slasher trend of the 1980s, with Jason, Michael and Freddy and their knifes/axes just reincarnations of the Killer Shark's teeth. Man exists of 90% water and some anthropologists have theorized that our original habitat was the beach, with it's easy pickings of seafood, fish and birds. Perhaps a Jungian terror of what lurks just beneath the ocean's surface has seeped into our very genes after lethal encounters with sharks, jellyfish, portuegese warships, poisonous snakes and tidal waves.Water is of course also the spiritual element, represented by the color blue. Whatever the reason, in the year of the Vietnamese Communist takeover of Vietnam, this lean, ruthless, low budget (for Spielberg) gem of a movie was made. Based on a book by Peter Benchley, this movie is at once a metaphor for the power of nature and man's powerlessness in the face of it, and in a strange way a Western, with mad shark hunter Quint as the gunslinger, Chief Brody as the Sheriff, and Mayor Vaughn and the store keepers as the weasly townspeople. Due tribute is also payed to the men of the USS Indianapolis, who delivered the Atom Bomb, and who's return journey was, to say the least, beset with tragedy.When it first came out, it scared me out of going near the local ditch, let alone the beach and later, I had to think twice to even go near the water line. Great use of suspense, great use of music to enhance the expectation and terror, this is a showcase of what a talented director can do with our most existential fears. The movie itself is part monster movie, part guys on a mission movie, part revenge movie and as such is very engaging. Even a quarter of a century after it was made, it hasn't really dated and can be viewed again and again. One of the best movies of all time and possibly the greatest horror movie of all time. Highly recommended.",10,2,4,6 November 2002
Blow," Pretty good drug movie
","Blow is the story of drug smuggler George Jung, his rise and fall, his relationship with his parents (Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths) and the women in his life (Franka Potente and the gorgeous Penelope Cruz).On the one hand, this is a great movie when it focuses on the entrepreneurial spirit of George Jung and his various buddies, with a great supporting role from Paul Reubens as Derek Foreal (but it won't rehabilitate him to making children's movies like Pee-wee's Playhouse anytime soon). In some ways this movie is the flip side of Miami Vice, which is nice to see.
We see Jung's rise from an entrepreneurial distributor of marijuana, to his rise in the cocaine world. All of this clicks along nicely, however, the later stages of the movie focus more on his self-obsession, culminating in the not so subtle plea from the real George Jung for his daughter to see him more often in prison. The women in his life seem to be one-dimensional b**tches (the love of his life dies on him, his mother turns him in and his wife flips and brings their daughter to see him in prison when the cash runs out), and you have to wonder how much of that is Jung himself instead.
It's also nice to see something about the people behind the news and in this case, the drug scene. In all, a pretty nice movie, but I could have done without the heavy handed and depressing moralizing at the end.",9,0,1,2 November 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," I'm having an old friend for dinner
","Silence Of The Lambs is one of the most influential horror movies of the early 1990s. It inspired Se7en and a host of other rip-offs (like Copycat). Outstanding performances by Anthony Hopkins, Jody Foster, Scott Glenn as well as Diane Baker and Kasi Lemmons make this movie extremely memorable. If you're at all into horror movies, let alone serial killer movies, this is the movie to see. The movie is based on Thomas Harris' second book featuring Hannibal Lecter, and it is one of his most researched ones, creating a sense of detail that is unmatched in most humdrum movie scripts. I think that's the real secret of this movie. The story is deceptively simple: FBI academy cadet Starling (Foster) is manoeuvred to interview serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) in his high security cell, because Lecter may or may not have information on another serial killer on the loose, 'Buffalo Bill'. Bill's latest victim is Katherine Martin, the daughter of a female senator and the clock, as they say, is ticking. The movie's psychological battles are not only between Starling and Lecter, but between she and her boss Jack Crawford, Senator Martin, Paul Krendler and head of the asylum, dr. Chilton (Anthony Heald's breakthrough performance - Law & Order, 8MM). Also, the movie is structured as a journey of discovery, for Clarice, who must face the horrors of her own past, as well for Lecter and 'Buffalo Bill'. It's director Jonathan Demme's achievement that he puts the emphasis of the story on the psychological battles, rather than the gore. This is also what makes this movie unique. 10 out of 10, because it's one of the great and significant movies of all time.",10,0,0,5 June 2002

It aren't disembodied, knife wielding teenage slashers that scare me - Scream (1,2,3), I Know What You Did Last Summer (1,2), or even Michael Myers or Jason or Freddy back in the day left me cold. The Sixth Sense succeeds, because it mainly (not exclusively) uses eerieness, isolation and a bone deep sense of loneliness as it's main tools. Also, it asks: how do we really know we're alive? The acting is first rate, from Toni Colette as Cole's mom and Haley Joel Osment as Cole, the acting is very natural, believable. There's not a bad performance in it. Also, Donnie Wahlberg was totally unrecognizable.The plot twist at the end, is made even more intrigueing, because it makes you doubt who else, other than Willis, is in the same position. Cole? Cole's mom? However, this doesn't work because of inconsistencies throughout the movie, which is a pity, as the movie would have been even scarier because of it (I hope this is cryptic enough).",Null,0,0,14 April 2001
