The Hangover," Hysterical!
","Only reason I am adding my two cents in is because I want to negate one negative rating on this site. I haven't laughed this much since Blazing Saddles, and people that is a long time ago! I thought The Hangover was brilliant. My 12 year old son begged me to take him.(that much I fear I should have did a little investigation, a couple of scenes warrant NC-17) I figured okay another Pineapple Express, for my son what's 90 minutes of boredom, no biggie. I went in blindly. Then WAM, this was F-U-N-N-Y, funny stuff, if you didn't laugh, that's sad, maybe time to lighten up. For me these were original and fresh gags! And I'm no fan of R-Rated sexist slap stick usually filled with mindless moronic nonsense, but this movie is the bomb! It is definitely a man's movie though.The writers are fantastic comedians with the utmost timing, the acting is superb. Who are these dudes?! The only 'actor' I recognized was Heather Graham and she was awesome too. 2 thumbs up, I'm buying the DVD for sure. No exaggeration, for me, this was the comedy of the decade.",10,6,10,12 August 2009
Forrest Gump," An American Classic
","Hanks and Senise are brilliant along with the rest of the cast. From start to finish, most everyone will love this flick. I can't find fault with this movie, and I am shocked by some of the negative comments on this forum because it is a truly great film. I've watched this movie at least 10 times and I just love it. This movie is filled with all the emotions done with precision. Just sit back and enjoy it. In some ways it is so light on the outside and so profound in other ways. Gump is a wonderful movie for all ages and is so very deep. You will die laughing and also cry your eyes out. All you need is a pulse and you will love this movie for ever. 10 out of 10! One of the most memorable movies of all time.",10,4,7,12 July 2007
Life Is Beautiful," Masterpiece
","The word genius is terribly overused in our society, probably because there are so few. Benigni is a genius! This movie is about LOVE, Selflessness, and hope! If you are going to watch one movie in your whole life, this is it! If you love movies like I do, this is why!I saw this movie when it first opened, my Mother called me and begged me to see this movie immediately. I knew not what is was about. Like a good son, I obeyed my mom. It starts off Benigni wooing his wife to be, Nicoletta Braschi, with all the slapstick of a Chaplin flick. They get married and have the CUTEST little boy, played by Giorgio Cantarini. (Oh That Face!!!) Life is beautiful until those Nazi's come. The movie does a 180 degree turn and your mesmerized for the next 75 minutes. You will roar with laughter and cry like a baby. I never thought I would truly have one favorite movie of all time. Before this movie, I'd say Beckett (with O'Toole and Burton), GodFather, Amadeus, etc. Then this flick comes along.I still can't believe Benigni wrote, directed, and starred in this movie. Unbelievable achievement. He's my hero!And speaking of hero's, all the movies, all the Arnold Schwarzenegger's , Bruce Willis', Stalones, etc etc etc and this little ugly skinny Italian is one of the greatest heroine's in Cinema history!",10,2,4,20 June 2005
