Lucky Number Slevin," You simply have to see this film.
","The phrase 'Must see movie' is over used these days. It seems everything is a 'summer blockbuster' or 'greatest movie ever'. Normally they lie. This time, they do not.From the first flickering shot of a phone ringing, you know this movie will make you think and it does not disappoint. For the blood lovers, there are enough bullets flying around to keep you happy. For the guys, there's Lucy Liu on fine form as a bouncy and too cute girl. For the girls there's Josh Hartnett in a towel.I won't say anything about the actually movie because everything should be a surprise. You simply have to see it. Like Memento, Seven, Sixth Sense, this is a movie that you have to see to appreciate and to understand why everyone is raving about it.Unfortunately, like the other good films I just mentioned, this isn't one you can see again and again. At its heart, it is a mystery and once you know the truth it just doesn't have the same impact.See it at the cinema, come out looking overwhelmed and saying 'Damn that was a good movie'Â… and if anyone even starts blurting out the ending, head-butt them quickly.",9,6,17,26 February 2006
