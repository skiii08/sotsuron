The Ring," Warning ( contains spoilers)great horror movie
",I just finished watching The Ring for the first time and i was very impressed it was one of the most orignal movies i have ever watched and it kept you intrested right up to its fantastic ending. It also has an almost false ending you think everything is gonna be fine for the main characters and then they throw in that final frghting twist and then leaves you with your mouth open thinkng 'Damn i dident see that coming' it was well acted and written movie from strat to finish  and i reccomend it to anyone looking for a good scare,8,1,1,4 March 2003
