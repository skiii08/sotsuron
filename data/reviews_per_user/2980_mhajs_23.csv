Walk the Line," Great biography movie !
","**** out of **** I was really doubtful concerning my vote for Walk The Line. Should it be 9 or 10? Then I realized there was no reason at all for me to rate it with a 9. This is a perfect love story. There are moments you really feel bad about this movie, scenes which you wish shouldn't be as they are. But that's what's so good about it! You cheer for Johnny, even though it's bad that wrong steps are made throughout the path. But the title synchronizes perfectly with the ending.This movie is even greater when there is the fact that you may not have listened to Johnny Cash songs yet. I, myself, just listened to two songs: 'Ring Of Fire' (I only listened to that one because of the movie trailer) and 'The Wanderer', a song which Johnny recorded with U2 in the album Zooropa. My only regret for Johnny's songs is that somehow they look all the same. The rhythm is always the same! There was this song I found remarkable, written by June Carter, 'Time's A Wasting'. Perhaps the best song in the movie for me.This movie is a story. You listen to Johnny's songs in it, but it's a story. And you don't really have to KNOW Johnny Cash in order to appreciate this movie the right way. For last, Phoenix and Witherspoon performances are simply great! Both of them! I really hope they do win the Oscar! At least, just Reese! Also James Mangold is a gifted director. I watched Girl, Interrupted, and must say: both movies are great! Walk The Line far surpasses Girl, which I rated 9.Johnny's life story is really a story to tell in a movie! It's a shame it hasn't been nominated for best picture, but I haven't seen the nominees yet! Watch this movie with your heart! It's beautiful!",10,0,0,2 March 2006
Alien 3," This is movie might be a little underrated, but still, it doesn't deserve a lot of thumbs up...
","**1/2 out of ****How do I start writing a review about a movie so complex like this? Let's see. Seeing the other two alien movies, which are much, much better than this one, we may say this one is not that great, but it's not bad also. Alien3 continues the story of Lt. Ellen Ripley (played all the time, perfectly by Sigourney Weaver... until the fourth movie, which is pure crap), always the only survivor from the killing done by the nasty creatures of the saga. In every sequel of the saga, she's the only one from the entire crew, whether they're marine soldiers, ex-criminal prisoners or just crew members of a commercial spaceship, to survive. A lot of people complained about Hicks and Newt's death in the third movie, two characters from the second movie. Even James Cameron disagreed with the idea of having those two 'great characters' pass away. Well, considering all the pain, suffering, courage, fight and sweat from Ripley in Aliens (1986) in an attempt (at the time, successful) to save her comrades and most of all, Newt, it may be a little sad to see the last remaining characters from the last movie, to just die, out of nowhere, most of all, by unknown causes of causes of less priority, but hey! What, in fact, is the true essence of the alien movies? Isn't Ripley, always the lone survivor? Just like Mel Gibson in the Mad Max series. I find that idea quite interesting.Getting past Hicks and Newt's death, which is not a negative star for this movie, let's check on the new plot. Considering that, this movie should have never been made. The second installment, I guess, was made in an attempt to wipe out all the aliens from the face of the universe. Considering they're a major threat for the future days to come, specially if they're, somewhat, brought back to Earth, they really must be destroyed. But that doesn't happen in that exact way. In fact, they're only to be taken away, when the space station, which monitored the Weyland Yutani company crew members, find out that no signal is coming as a sign of communication. So, they send the marines, along with Ripley in a mission to do what couldn't have been done in the first movie. The first movie was the discovery. The second one was the solution to that. But what is Alien3? In Aliens, the planet is totally destroyed and even the alien queen, which comes back to the Sulaco is banished to deep space. The aliens are wiped out! But no. They write a completely different story, developing that the alien queen in fact was able to lay one last egg. OK, despite that, the rest is good.In the original threathical release, the new alien is born from a dog. The face hugger which came from the egg of the Sulaco attacks the dog and new alien is born from it. This was a great idea! Now the new creature can run faster and eat its victims like they're really some kind of a single meat. Once again, some people complained about that. Come on! What do you expect from a horror / science fiction movie, which has a nasty creature as the deadly monster to be the center of the story? For me, I guess, as long as there's plenty of blood, gore and everything and all, in that, at least, a horror movie succeeds.Characters? Not so good as the first two movies. We don't really care that much for them, since they're almost all crazy, criminals and all. Unlike criminals from movies like Pulp Fiction, who are characters who have great personality and style, people from Alien3 are really scum. Sometimes, it's even funny to see them dying in this movie. And, believe me, that's not nice for Alien movies. My only regret was the death of Clemens (Charles Dance), a great character, and when he was developing himself, he gets killed so suddenly. And the death of Aaron (Ralph Brown), another character who really should survive, but he's killed so unfair... Ripley's death? Well, it's nice too see an Alien movie end sad. The first two had happy endings, but with tons of portions of sadness. Alien3 just enhanced that feeling. And the final speech from the audio of the last lines of the first movie were great too. Just to remember how Ripley was. A fighter till the end. And Alien3 delivers that message well. 'Til the end'.",6,3,5,18 July 2005
Monster," I hate drama movies. This one, I loved.
","**** out of **** After having a fight with one of my best friends (or maybe the best), to watch a drama movie was the last thing I had in mind. When I rented 'Monster', I already knew that Charlize Theron (whose beauty I have only seen in magazines, Oscar festivals and website photographs) have won the Oscar. I knew that also the cast included Christina Ricci, an actress who I haven't seen in a movie in a long time. I have watched the trailer, thought of the movie as a crime thriller, with drama ingredients, but only watching 'Monster', I have realized it was an intense (very) intense drama. I don't like drama movies at all, but this is a rare exception.As the movie opens, we see scenes of the narration of Charlize's character, Aillen (who in real life was a hooker) and we think of her as a person who just wants to succeed in life. Actually, she tries in the movie, but the way she tries, well, that's something you'll check better while you watch it. What happens in 'Monster' is that one day Aillen meets a girl in a bar called Selby (played by Christina). They become friends, Aillen sleeps in Selby's house and one day when they go out together, they kiss each other in a dance floor. That's when they start having relations with each other, like they're a couple. The feeling called love starts to take place. Aillen and Selby move to a house together, as Selby escapes from her home against her parent's will. Before moving on to the rest of the plot, there's something I'd like to say. I remember Roger Ebert's review of Back To The Future - Part II (1989), where he says that the movie is goofy, screwy and an exercise in goofiness. He probably didn't enjoy Part II to its full because the movie was the way he described. But in my opinion, when a movie is screwy, it catches our attention like we're paralyzed or something. We get so curious to know what's going to happen, we think 'but what if that happens' and so on. Tarantino's movies (whose birthday was yesterday, I'm writing this review one day after his birthday) are all screwy. In Pulp Fiction (1994), in the chapter of the golden watch, we get to see Bruce Willis with his girlfriend in his apartment building room, preparing the bags to leave with her. But when he finds out he's lost his watch, he starts getting mad, yells at his girlfriend, crashes the TV and goes on a quest to find his lost watch. That involves killing John Travolta, crashing a car on the street and... haven't you seen the movie? I won't spoil this! But what's most funny is that almost all scenes begin so innocently, so natural, so quiet, while characters are talking to each other and all, but than suddenly, we start to see madness takes shape.All right, getting back to the review, Monster is kinda like that. When Aillen and Selby are finally together in their new room, we start to see why 'Monster' is so like the other screwy movies. At the scene of the first client, when Aillen and him are inside the car, they're talking naturally like nothing's really that important is about to happen. Until we see the rest of the scene. And the rest of the movie. Well, you must watch it in order to really understand what I'm saying.I definitely wouldn't have enjoying this movie that much if it wasn't based on a true story. Because if it wasn't, the plot and the writing would be much too absurd! I couldn't believe Selby was really enjoying being with that hooker, that street woman, that unknown and stranger. I really could believe because I remembered the movie's opening titles 'Based on a true story.' 'Monster' is nicely directed by Patty Jenkins, who really made a masterpiece as a director. When you select the DVD's extra features and start watching the making of Monster, you understand why Jenkins is so talented in this movie. She went to all the real locations that the story took place and filmed the movie at the same ones. As she said in the documentary, she really got inside her movie. Charlize also deserved the leading role academy award for her talent as well. I guess that Christina Ricci also made a wonderful job as Selby, it was a very emotional performance. Great! Really great! Both of them! BT's score is also really great! That piano sounds at the roller wheal scene even made me remember Final Fantasy X's score where Tidus goes to Besaid for the first time. Everyone gave everything they could to bring you this drama movie based on a true story. I really suggest even if you do not like drama movies, to watch this one, because it's great! Just don't fight with anyone before watching this movie or you may get sad twice you should be.",10,0,1,28 March 2005
Alien: Resurrection," The weakest chapter of the saga.
","Alien : Ressurrection (1997) by Alan Sampaio* out of ****This movie is deadly awful. First, the worst thing they could have ever done: to resurrect Ripley. Ripley's dead, man! Why resurrect her only to make another movie? Money, anyone? Great possibility. At least, they could have cloned her, but stay with her personality of the past, the great, powerful, kick-ass Lt. Ellen Ripley. But they changed the character completely! Now Ripley's more humorous, smiling all the time, giving us an idea that she's enjoying what's happening around her. And to kill an alien is as funny as it is to kill a monster in a video game for her. Bad consequences? The movie lost all the true alien elements from the previous movies: horror, suspense, fear emanating from the characters, all the essence of the alien movies has gone. And even Alien³ was too, an awful chapter in the quadrilogy, at least, Ripley still has Sigourney Weaver's great performance on her side. Weaver really did a horrible job, playing Ripley in Alien : Ressurrection, and that's a shame and at the same time, funny, since she was nominated for best actress in a leading role for Aliens (1986). And there's still people who think that this movie is 'not great as the others, but still good'. I don't believe it. This movie sucks in every way.I haven't watched other Jean-Pierre Jeunet movies yet. But if you consider this one, the others must be a disaster. (Or maybe not, because in every artist, there are high and low points). But to insert humor elements in a horror/science fiction saga must have been the idea of a god! Ron Pearlman plays Johner, one of the few great characters in the movie. His presence on screen would be much better, had the movie sustained horror and dark elements from the previous movies. His performance is great, but why kill a spider with a gun and kiss Vriess in the mouth? Must be that god-idea thing. The rest of the cast includes Winona Ryder, Michael Wincott, Gary Dourdan, Brad Dourif and some others. They make a very good list of great actors, but some roles in this movie are pathetic! The action of the movie is quite good, but with no horror elements, like the ones we see in Aliens. When the creatures sneak in the complex right at the end of the movie, when all lights go out and all we see is a red light, we notice how the characters are frightened. They shoot, while at the same time shouting like they'd really die right there. But in A:R, it seems fun to kill aliens. I wonder why they didn't do that Luke Skywalker thing in Episode IV, when Luke and Han are escaping from the death star and fighting some ships in outer space: 'Ha ha! I got them!'The story might be good, but is completely unnecessary and added nothing to the saga. Breed more aliens using human victims. Then they escape, and... let's hunt some buggies! And, also, the special edition DVD added nothing interesting and I even dare say that it's become even worse than the original version. That beginning credits where the title appears? What the hell was that bug, being squashed by that guy? And the ending was much worse than the original. The dialog's is almost the same, but this time, Ripley and Call actually land on earth. I preferred much more the original where we only see the skies from a high height.I really do hope they don't make another alien movie. Because the truly good ones were only the first two.",3,2,4,14 August 2005
Batman Returns," The best Batman.
","*** out of **** By the time I'm writing this review, I haven't seen Batman Begins (2005) yet, but I can tell that this is the best (or least worse) Batman movie so far. When I watched it yesterday, I kinda of thought it was cool, but it is too absurd at times! Sure this is not only a super-hero movie, but it's also a Tim Burton one. And as far as I'm concerned, Burton sometimes likes to be absurd at his movies. But don't get me wrong! I liked this movie! First of all, the best of it is the Gotham City itself. It's dark and sinister and it fits perfectly with Danny Elfman's score. Actually Elfman's score is another great point! I guess that the best part of the score is when Selina is tearing up her apartment and becomes the Catwoman herself. The score for Batman is great also, but it's more like a heroic score, while the Catwoman's score is more dark, which sure was something I loved! For Pinguin and his clowns, the score becomes a little more silly and childish perhaps, but it's still a great score.For this movie, the story focus now on the Pinyin. There are also other characters like Christopher Walken's one and his son. I loved Christopher Walken, he's as sinister as hell in this one. And Michelle Pfeiffer as the Catwoman! She is truly great, deadly and hot! This is the true Catwoman, not this stupid clown that Halle Berry played recently! I hate that woman with all my guts! There is not much to be said about this movie, unless you spoil some plot twists. All I can say is that Danny Elfman's score is great, the performances are great, the Gotham City great also, and Michael Keaton is sure the best Batman that we ever had. The only problem of this movie is that sometimes it becomes a little silly and too absurd. I don't know how the Pinguin got to live in a sewers that is so beautiful (if you know how to decorate itself, of course), but that's OK anyway. I would make that water, my own private pool instead of the one I, myself, have. But since this is a super-hero movie, we may even tolerate some things. But Spider-Man is sure much more realistic! Well, a taste is a taste....The only one thing I didn't really get is why the Catwoman wants to beat Batman. Maybe I'll post this on the IMDb forum.",7,1,2,17 June 2005
X-Men," It's good, but the second movie is much better!
","*** out of ****I first watched this movie on theaters in 2000, but only now I have rented it and I'm ready to make a review. I never was that fan of comic books or super heroes, never even read those books or watched the animated series. So this review is based on a writer who is making a review of the movie alone with no references at all to the comic books or animated series. Well, maybe, just a bit.When X-Men came out to the theaters, I remember people were really excited. There was a boy who was almost dying in his chair before the movie even began, because of the excitement he was having and he even said: 'This movie is gonna explode!' Well, the movie began. In the first movie, we see characters like Wolwerine, Cyclops, Storm, Prof. Xavier, Magneto and some others, just to name the most famous ones. I really liked the cast of the movie, Halle Berry is not that bad as Storm as she is in other movies, but even so, Storm was a very easy role she took. Special effects add a lot to her performance, as she stroked Toad (Ray Park) with a thunder while her face was built on glowing white eyes and wind blowing through her hair. In this movie, we may say that Berry is not that bad, but it's not that great. The others are much greater. Starting with Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen), these two really perform seriously like they were the same characters from the novel. Magneto may not be looking physically the same way as in the comic books or the animated series, but still, the performance was what count the most. And the special effects and costumes a lot also. Oh, I almost forgot about Rogue (Anna Panquin). The screams she was known for to win the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role in The Piano (1993) are here in this movie too, in the beginning of it, when she first meet with her special powers. Wolwerine (Hugh Jackman) is great also, but I still think that his hair in the movie is horrible. It was a great hair for the animated series, but for the movie, it just seems a little weird and ugly. The only time his hair is actually good (or as we may say, natural) is when he wakes up from the bed in the scene where Jean Grey (Fanke Janssen) is about to give him a shot. She's also great in the movie and beautiful the same way she is in GoldenEye (1995).Well, all performances were great, special effects and all too. So, what am I complaining about? Well, I liked the plot and the school introduction too, even so, the plot seems to have been a little simple and the action is not that great. Maybe it was, but I really guess that the second movie was much greater. There are many more action sequences, the movie is longer, and more characters are introduced. It was a nice start for a marvel movie. But you should really watch X-Men, maybe if you are an X-Men fan, or maybe if you just want to see the movie, but the main reason in my opinion is that you should watch it just to watch X2 later on.",7,0,1,7 April 2005
Lost in Translation," Puaba! Puaba! Puaba!
","**** out of **** I wasn't even going to write reviews anymore. Reviews are written in order for us to register our thoughts, and for those who haven't seen the movie or have, to read our reviews and make conclusions to whether they agree or not. Lost In Translation is a movie that must have a review written for it.I can't deny that I rented this only because of Scarlett Johansson. I already knew that Sophia Coppola won the Oscar award for writing directly for the screen, already knew this was a good movie, but got it just because of her. And I must say... she's gorgeous in this movie. I disagree 100% with those who say that her rusty voice sucks and that she's a horse faced with big lips. I find nothing wrong with all of that at all. She's the most cute girl I have ever seen! Those Japanese girls next to her for me were the same as men. But I have been very delighted at the end of this movie, because it was great.The story is about a girl named Charlotte, played by Scarlett, who travels to Tokyo, Japan, with her husband John (Giovanni Risbi), because he's a photographer and he's traveling on business and since she doesn't have anything important to do without him, she goes with him. But loneliness announce itself with doubts and sadness as she gazes at the buildings of Tokyo, alone at her room... lost in translation. Scarlett is exactly in this movie as I always imagined her to be. A delicate person, with a rusty, but beautiful voice, simple and beautiful, only wearing her underwear lying on her bed, decorating the room and hurting her foot. Even when Anna Faris (Kelly) introduces herself on a scene where she meets the John and Charlotte couple, there's a huge difference on personality, beauty and presence between herself and Scarlett. By the time Kelly goes away and Charlotte starts talking, rusty voice and all, the boring and stubborn girl has just gone and the angel started speaking.Well, if I'm about to just talk about Scarlett throughout this entire review, I won't get to the movie itself. So, here it is. Charlotte meets a man, an actor, Bob Harris, played by Bill Murray. (I personally prefer much more the dramatic and serious Bill rather than the comedian one of the past). Both of the characters are alone in Tokyo, meet themselves and then begins a relationship between the two like no other you could imagine. The locations of the shootings are beautiful. The soundtrack is perfect! Sophia Coppola in the behind the scenes section of the DVD, Lost On Location, is also gorgeous, beautiful, talented and fun. Lost In Translation is a movie like very few others. A unique masterpiece. Quite difficult to put all the words here. Looks like I'm lost too....PS.: I cried the two times I saw this movie. The ending is very sad, as we know that the goodbyes can be very hard. Specially when you're saying goodbye to a wonderful person you met... and also, someone you might never meet again...",10,7,13,14 October 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Why Revolutions IS a great movie!
","**** out of ****The Matrix Revolutions is the final chapter in the saga created by the Wachowski brothers and I must say I am very happy by being completely satisfied by watching it.While the previous two movies relied more inside the virtual 'matrix' world, the third installment takes place almost all the time at the real world. Good? Bad? No. Not even close. It's perfect! There aren't too much fight scenes in this movie, this time it's more like a war between the machines and the Zion defense army. How this was done was masterfully done, by letting us see the sentinels invading the docks, characters showing differences of opinions about how they should defend the city, and the best of all: Neo returning to the source.For many, this may feel to much like a fantasy story, but you have to see that the matrix movies are a fantasy story. By imagining a futuristic world where the horizon is fully populated by robotic buildings, dark lightning-striking skies, an underground city and a virtual world where you defy the rules and laws of physics, Larry and Andy really created such a fantastic sci-fi trilogy.It wouldn't be the same if this movie had been done the same way as the other two... it had to innovate, to show something different, to focus on what hasn't been yet and all the events in it: the death of Neo and Trinity, Neo returning to the source, the machines and humans peace agreement, the conversation between the oracle and the architect, the defeat of Agent Smith, everything was great! The ending might have lacked something, but still, this is my all-time favorite sci-fi trilogy.",10,1,2,12 January 2006
Batman Begins," The completely remade image of Batman.
","**** out of ****If there ever was a movie which could be not only so original, it would be great, but also would make us forget the other prequel movies of it, that movie would definitely be Batman Begins. Do you know when you watch a movie, and then you watch a sequel? Even if the sequel is always supposed to be different, even though at almost many times, it becomes imitation of the original, you still see some resemblance of the two movies, like same styles, same scenarios or same ideas. Maybe the sequel may evolve, maybe not. But Batman Begins is kinda different. Not only it is a movie that actually evolved a lot from its other prequels, but also a totally unique and brand new movie where you will not see many (or none) resemblances because the film-making changed completely to make us see Batman in a total different way. In fact, when the movie ended and the credits begin to roll, I immediately told my friends that this is the first Batman movie. There wasn't any Batman movies before this one, this is the first. Finally Batman arrives at the big screen. For the first time ever. I know that this isn't true, but that's the feeling I had when I watched it. I don't know how the sequels will be (because if there is going to be three Spider-Man movies, why can't we have three Batman movies?), but the first one surely was a great start for (we hope) a great trilogy.As a friend of mine even said: 'This movie remade the batman image completely.' Watch it and you'll agree right away. Batman Begins, nicely directed by Christopher Nolan, tells the story of the beginning of Bruce Wayne's life. How and why he became Batman. This time, the bat-man is played by Christian Bale. I still think that Michael Keaton is the best, but Bale was great too. At the party, the scene where Bruce Wayne says goodbye to his guests is one of the greatest proofs that Bale plays Bruce Wayne very good! Michael Caine is good also as Alfred (he never let me down in one of his performances), but still I find out that Michael Gough was much better, not only because of his performance, but because he really looked like Alfred. The rest of the cast includes great actors, some of them, very unlikely to appear in a batman movie, but they did. Cillian Murphy, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman and Liam Neesom. This last one is great as one of the villains. Overall, Batman Begins is the batman movie. Even for those who are not fan of the comic books we'll sure to enjoy this movie, as in my country, many people really did. I just give a 9 out of 10, because I guess that sometimes, when you look at it, this movie looks like a crime movie. This happens because of the many sub-plots and because of the long-waiting for finally see Bruce Wayne in the batman costume. But getting past that scenes (which are not by any means, unnecessary, they're just the trigger to be pulled for us to see the rest of the movie), what happens next is of total delight.",10,0,1,29 June 2005
"Girl, Interrupted"," A great drama movie about the true story of a problematic girl.
","**** out of **** 'Girl, Interrupted' is the true story of a girl from the 1960's called Susanna Kaysen, who in the movie is played by Winona Ryder. She tries to kill herself by taking a full bottle of aspirin with a full bottle of vodka. That's my only regret for the movie, nothing more. Susanna goes to a mental institution, Claymoore, only for doing that, and although that's not, by any means, an 'only', later in the movie, we discover that Susanna has nothing particularly wrong with herself, at least, she doesn't show that a lot. The only thing that she actually needs to do is to understand her problem, which in the movie is called 'Borderline Disorder Personality'. So, she meets the rest of the people from the mental institution, including Angelina Jolie, who plays Lisa Rowe.Jolie is terrific. Couldn't have been better. She really deserved an Oscar for best actress in a supporting role and she also contributes a lot to one of the greatest qualities of the movie: the performances. There are also other girls with mental problems, including a girl who lies, another one who, by the age of 10, burned herself in the face and many others. All of them in the women ward, where also later we meet Vanessa Redgrave and Whoopi Goldberg. The soundtrack is also great too, as it sometimes feels sad, sometimes happy and sometimes even childish, but at the same time, alternatively interesting, adding a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. And finally, Kurtwood Smith makes a quick, but nice appearance at the beginning of the movie, as Dr. Crumble. The rest of the cast includes: Clea Duvall, Angella Bettis, Elizabeth Moss and even Brittany Murphy, who plays one of the most problematic girls of the story.'Girl, Interrupted' is a great drama movie and by this time, I've already watched it twice and not only I'm interested in watching it again, I want to watch the other Winona Ryder movies because I think her career is simply one of the best.",9,1,1,9 May 2005
Reservoir Dogs," Realistic like hell. But reality sometimes may be it.
","*1/2 out of **** Let's talk about music. I am a true heavy metal fan and my favorite bands are Iron Maiden, Stratovarius and Iced Earth. I also like other bands and even I like jazz and blues. My cousin likes blues a lot. Sometimes we listen to blues together when we go out, when we drink. I went to a musical concert in 2003 of a death metal band called Krisiun. I can tell you that since that day, my life has completely changed. My left earring is not the same anymore as it was before, but still I can listen pretty well and this is truly cruel. Cruel to know that my earring is not the same anymore. Now, if going to a musical concert and not listening the same way I did before is already cruel, can you imagine what would it be if I had my earring cut? This isn't cruelty anymore, it's madness in colors, physical. When Quentin Tarantino directed Reservoir Dogs, I really do believe he was trying to show how mad he could get. But I mean, mad. To the limit. As we see Michael Madsen slash the earring of a cop off, and then we see that big red whole in the face of the poor man, we see how Tarantino turned to be a monster director in this movie. That scene is way too violent, too extra-terrestrial mad and insane, not only I felt completely beaten in my chair, I wanted to throw up. After the end of that scene, I was so shocked, I couldn't almost keep my head holden up to watch this insanity to the end. After the movie was over, I wanted to take a look at the deleted scenes. And what do I find? Not only that scene was way too cruel, but there's another scene, another version of the scene, where the titles on the screen appears: 'Warning! This is a very violent scene, not suitable for some viewers' or something like that. Do you know what I did? I turned the DVD player and TV off. If the scene that got inside the movie was already the way it was, how would it be as a deleted scene? Reservoir Dogs (1992), insanely directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a movie for people who have guts and stomach to watch. It's a movie for those who can have launch while watching Steve-O throw up in Jackass - The Movie (2002). I understand that this is a debut movie and I even dare congratulate Mr. Q. for having directed this movie as a debut. But it's not because it's a debut, I should give credits because we must be professional writers. I don't consider myself as a professional writer, but I try to be, at least. This was just one scene, but if we discuss the rest of the movie, we're going to find out that it's about a group of men who must do a dirty job. They must go on a mission where they must steal some diamonds and leave. But everything goes wrong, because the alarm gets triggered (it was shame that this hasn't been filmed, but it's OK), Mr.Blonde (Michael Madsen, more hateful than ever before) starts firing people, almost killing Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr.Orange (Tim Roth) gets shot in the stomach. Everything went wrong because the alarm got triggered, policemen arrived at the crime scene and there's a traitor! The plot is incredibly good as it always was in the Tarantino movies. But Tarantino is a man who as he likes to show violence, he shows it as a masterpiece. Pulp Fiction (1994) and Kill Bill Vol.1 (2003) and Vol.2 (2004) are all great, because Tarantino knows how to use violence. The eye scene at Kill Bill Vol.2 is quite shocking too, but when I went to Krisiun concert, I didn't leave having eyes trauma. God, I'm even shaking as I'm writing this down! I'm totally dizzy.Well, to conclude this review, I must say that if you like violence and/or have an iron stomach, you might have fun while watching this piece of insanity and may like the movie. But I don't think that if a director likes violence, he has to show it the way he wants. OK, Reservoir Dogs has its characters, plot, good songs (as always in Tarantino movies), greatly great performances (as the actors really showed they're actually dogs) but also violence. And a lot. If you, like me have watched this movie and hated Tarantino, but haven't seen his other movies, let me say something to you. Watch the other movies! They're much greater as evolution took place. I might even watch that deleted scene of the different version of the earring cutting, but only if I'm really way too drunk!",4,1,3,3 April 2005
The Da Vinci Code," Horrible adaption to the big screen...
","* *** Some minor spoilers ahead *** Ever since I finished reading all 4 Dan Brown novels, I've been expecting that a filmmaker would deliver a masterpiece on the big screen. To begin, I wish they could have just shot Angels & Demons first, then The Da Vinci Code. But rather than that, they did Da Vinci first instead. In my opinion, the result is a disaster.For those who haven't read the novel, the story is about an American teacher, Robert Langdon, who is an specialist in old history, symbols, religion tales and some other interesting stuff. He's famous in the academic world and whenever there's some fanatic trying to figure some possible hidden meaning in a painted picture, or a text in a book, they seek him. There's just a single scene in the entire movie I really loved and that was when Langdon is presenting some symbols to the public in a presentation. Both movie and book tell the story about a man who is brutally murdered and Langdon is asked for help by the french police. The main problem with this movie is that director Ron Howard simply took the book and threw it away to the big screen. The scenes seems rushed (Langdon and Neveu in the book have great chemistry and even share a kiss at the end, but in the movie, there's no chemistry at all and maybe it was even wise not having shot a scene where this happens).Besides that, Howard changed some details here and some other details there. Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu is horrendous! Ian McKellen as Teabing is another let-down too. In the book, he's very charismatic and even when he takes over, Dan Brown never expects us to believe he is evil. In the movie, in a failed attempt to try giving climax to it, Teabing rises like some traitor, with almost no purpose at all, threatening Langdon and Neveu as we never would have imagined.This movie seems to have been made as if the actors interpreted it like it was some stage script show, making everything artificial. The flashback scenes are not that great and the characters are not believable at all. The book is much better. The only two actors I sincerely enjoyed were Alfred Molina and Paul Bettany. Not even Jean Reno saves the show in this one, and let me tell you: I was really looking forward to seeing Fache.",3,3,6,7 June 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," A more inside look into the Matrix.
","**** out of ****The Matrix Reloaded follows the story that The Matrix told us back in 1999 and it's the first part of a single 3-4 hours movie (with The Matrix Revolutions). This movie entertained me just as much as the first one did and if the Wachowski brothers had to die tomorrow, they'd still be remembered only for the matrix.In the second movie, we get to see with much more details the greatness of the futuristic world. Set underground, near the earth's core, where the heat is much more high, the human race has managed to build a world I haven't seen in any other movie yet. There are other worlds which resemble a little. The futuristic world of Chrono Trigger (1995) (VG), for example, where you get to see in every sight possible, everything destroyed and the only remains where the humans may still refugee themselves are inside old domes.The main difference between this movie and the next one is that this one focuses a little more on the matrix than the real world and Revolutions does the opposite. For that, many may have disliked the movie, stating that it was less interesting than the others. But the story was almost complete except for one thing: the end of the war must be shown in every way it can be. If the matrix movies focused only on the matrix world and less on the real world, it wouldn't be the same thing. Revolutions saves the trilogy brilliantly.The Wachowski brothers have done it again. The sequels features new characters, more plot improvement, great special effects and many surprises. I loved it!",10,0,1,11 January 2006
Man on Fire," A nice idea from Tony Scott.
","***1/2 out of **** Man On Fire is a movie about kidnapping. Even when the movie begins, we see the titles on screen about how kidnapping takes place in South America. In the beginning of the movie, we meet the character of Denzel Washington, Creasy, a man who served the army and now is looking for a new job. We also meet Ray, character of Chirstopher Walken. Both Walken and Washington are really interesting in the movie. However, we already know these two actors are good and can do a pretty nice job. We must pay attention to the real star of the movie, at least in my opinion, which is, of course, Dakota Fanning. After watching Uptown Girls (2003), I must say Fanning improved a lot. I, now, have four more words for her: great performance, great role! She's not artificial as she is in Uptown anymore, this time she's a child who just wants to be friends with her new bodyguard Creasy. The beginning of the movie is focused entirely on the relationship between Creasy and Pita. She's sweet, pretty, smiles a lot and, as a matter of fact, it's her turn now to make someone smile, as she does with Creasy when they're studying history together and not someone make her smile. She studying to play the piano, but her real passion is to swim. And to improve her skills in order to win in the first place. She tells Creasy she can't win, because she's slow. Creasy says she's not slow, and she answers that she can't make even to the third position, so Creasy tells her that maybe she really is slow. If it was for Uptown, she'd probably order Creasy to shut up and to respect her because he's working for her. But instead of that she does exactly what she was supposed to do in Uptown to make her character nice: smile. So Creasy and Pita train together so she can win at the swimming pool event. So begins their friendship.But as said before, Man On Fire is a movie about kidnapping. Something wrong happens in the street and Pita is taken away by a Mexican organization and Creasy, shot almost to death laying on the ground is unable to protect her. The group proposes a rescue by asking in return the quantity of 10 million dollars. Something goes wrong again and it is believed now Pita's dead. As we see Creasy restore himself in order to hunt the bad guys, at first, we get a little upset. It gives us the impression that this movie is just another of those old Steven Seagal movies about revenge, about a guy who must kill everyone just because he's moved by anger. It is actually fun to see Washington wasting the bad guys and asking them questions about further details of the organization. But even when that happens, it still feels just as a revenge movie. But something told me Pita was still alive because I can't believe Tony Scott, a great director, just killed the very big star of the movie. And when we find out that's actually true, we see that Man On Fire is worth watching. Because it's not just a revenge movie, but a movie where a man has an objective: save the girl. And he does that very heroic.I've watched also, another movie of Tony Scott, Spy Game (2001), which I still need to write the review. By watching these two movies, we must agree that the brother of Ridley Scott is a very talented professional. In his movies, he shows us violence, most of the time, crime situations, in a way we understand better how things turn out to be in such countries. In Spy Game we see how the CIA really works and we see also a lot of countries. This time, Man On Fire is entirely focused just in Mexico, but still we see how things happens in there. I haven't watched the other Tony Scott movies, but these two, for me, had the same objectives: show us how crime works in different ways in different places. And that is a very nice idea, so, congratulations, Mr. Scott!Harry Gregson-Williams is one more time back to give the movie a great score. He also works on the Konami's Metal Gear trilogy video game for the PlayStation, and in both Spy Game and Man On Fire and in the Metal Gear trilogy, he delivers a very good piece of music. With nice soundtrack, a great director, the infinite improvement of a very good actress like Fanning and the presence of two great actors like Washington and Walken, you really got to watch this movie.",8,0,1,4 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," After watching Episode III, you'll have a much more different look on Star Wars! A masterpiece!
","**** out of ****** WARNING! THIS COMMENT SPOILS ALMOST EVERYTHING ABOUT THE MOVIE, SO READ IT ONLY IF YOU'VE ALREADY WATCHED IT! **For the first time ever, when you watch a Star Wars movie, you get a different feeling. The feeling of defeat, of sadness, of the birth of the most famous villain in movie history. Sure this also happened a little at the end of Episode V where Han Solo (played by young Harrison Ford) gets frozen in carbonite to be taken away by Boba Fett, the bounty hunter. A little of this we see also in Episode VI where Vader finally perishes. But here, we have Star Wars : Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith, not only the last installment of the series, but also maybe the best movie of it, and the greatest feeling that you can get: the sadness. I say this because that's what was missing in the other Star Wars films. In Episode I (which is by the way the most childish film in the series and definitely the worst), we get to see many stupid scenes with the most horrible character in the series, Jar Jar Binks. Sure I liked Jake Scott as young Anakin Skywalker, but still he is a child and we can't blame him for that. So in the scenes that he appears, we usually get the feeling of happiness, of fun, of many non-sad things, as I may say that way. When he says goodbye to his mother, sure it's a sad scene, but the feelings of a child is not even by a long shot the same feelings as of those of Episode III, including not only the characters' but the decline of the republic and death of the Jedis as well. In Episode II, there are many love scenes including Padme (Natalie Portman) and Anakin (now played by Hayden Christensen). But in Episode III, finally we get the feeling that we didn't have at the other movies. This makes of Episode III not only a different Star Wars movie, but also a movie in the series which you see in a totally different way. Finally George Lucas has changed (not that he didn't in the other movies), but in here we see the drastic change takes place. You may like even more Episode IV, after you've watched Episode III, because you now know what happened just before. Everything in this movie is perfect! I watched it with like 10 or more so friends at the theater, just yesterday, but since after that, I got to drink with some other friends of mine, today at morning is the only time I found to write about this masterpiece. Beginning with the special effects and action sequences. Perfect! Just perfect! When the movie begins, we see Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) pilot some star ships in a mission to rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). This may be the longest action sequence in the beginning of a Star Wars movie, the longest prologue with great action sequences and great special effects. Now the series has evolved a lot. One of the most non-fighter characters of all characters of Star Wars finally gets the chance to show himself what he's made of, and that's R2-D2! Yep! He (or it) makes the ground gets wet with oil and then puts fire on the place, burning two droids! And then there's the scene of the fight with Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), a very short encounter with another great villain, Gen. Grievous and a very risky landing of the starship that Anakin, Palpatine and Obi-Wan are in at Coruscant. Other action sequences includes a great (but short) fight scene between Obi-Wan and Grievous. I mean short, because Grievous has 4 light sabers and even so, Obi-Wan cuts Grievous' arms very fast! That was my only complaint here, but that doesn't matter much, since the fight goes on and on until Obi-Wan gets a blaster and shoots Grievous dead for sure! Other scenes includes Mace Windu and Sen. Palpatine, now at his original form, Darth Sidious, fighting themselves to the death, the great final scene of the fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan and the fight between Yoda (who is perfect in this film, at his best) and Sidious and finally the great transformation of Anakin to Darth Vader. I must say that from Episode II to Episode III, Christensen hasn't evolved much, I still don't like him that much as I do with the other characters, but that doesn't matter much also, since the scenes including him are perfect. His performance could be better, but that's OK anyway.Now, let's discuss about the plot. It's also perfect! It connects perfectly and masterfully with Episode IV and all of the events are explained. At least, I didn't remember an event which wasn't explained at all. Padme have 2 babies, Luke and Leia, Leia is given by Obi-Wan to Bail Organa and Luke is given to Owen and Beru Lars on Tatooine. Padme dies on birth. Yoda gets exiled. The republic is transformed to the evil galactic empire. The only actual thing that didn't happen was when Obi-Wan decided to change his name to Ben. Even Chewbacca appears in the movie! So we see that everything that was leaking explanations, gets to be explained in this movie as it fits great between Episodes II and IV. George Lucas may have make some mistakes here and there in Episodes I and II, but Episode III (I dare say it) is simply perfect. A full science fiction masterpiece. George Lucas has ended the Star Wars saga with a gold key.",7,5,10,20 May 2005
Lord of War," One Of Cage's best movies!
","**** out of ****Let me tell you that this movie is one of the best I've seen this year. Nicolas Cage is a great actor and he's the type of performer who for me is one of the best: just the ones who can act expressing themselves in a very convincing way, not only by facial expressions or body language, but also by very strong lines throughout the entire movie. His narration is amazing. He plays Yuri Orlov, an arms dealer, who although risks his life very often (he travels to many distant and dangerous places including many locations from the east lands and even finds himself locked up in a room with two hookers, with no rubber and in a country where 25% of the people is infected with AIDS), is lucky at being good at it, since he gains money, has a beautiful wife and a son.Like said before, most of the film is narrated by Cage. Even by paying attention to the self limit, it's not possible to absorb all of the great lines in this movie, and I must say I need to watch it again, however I won't pay to go to the theaters again, I'll wait it on DVD... The movie is about the life of an arms dealer, the difficulties of it, the advantages of a life like his own, consequences, and most important thing of all: not only a visionary movie about weapons, wars, injustice and etc., but, at the same time, a masterpiece of a protest, like a slap on the faces of the government people, or even, as the beginning of the movie suggests, a bullet in the head. The cast includes actors like Jared Leto, who plays Orlov's brother, who, although is not an arms dealer like his older brother, do other acts in the movie that helps us see another point of view, which is very interesting, since we don't get bored just with the main plot of the movie. Bridget Moynahan plays Cage's wife in a much better role than hers in I, Robot (not that it means it was bad, not at all) and Ian Holm, who I admire since the good old times of Alien. For people who didn't like the movie (like I checked on the IMDb's forum, this movie is for people who pay attention, have good tastes in movies' genres, not for people who aren't grown enough to see this movie's qualities yet).",10,8,15,3 November 2005
The Terminal," A masterpiece work of creativity.
","**** out of **** While this may not be Steven Spielberg's best film, it's sure to be one of the best. Not only him, but Tom Hanks as usual are both magnificent. This movie is the true work of creativity, making it unique and so different from other theatrical releases. I enjoyed a lot watching this movie, and even my father who doesn't have habits at all to watch movies, had a seat and watched this to the very end.The Terminal is the story about Victor Navorski, a traveler from a foreign country who needs to get a plane to New York. I won't spoil what he wants to do there, this is something which is only explained at the last 30-40 minutes of the movie. But something goes wrong and because of that, Navorski unfortunately can't leave the airport and enter the big city. Neither can him get a plane back to his country. He manages to live in the airport by doing many things which, of course, are very creative and fun to watch. But the only problem is that they're unreal.The problem with this movie (which has been the only thing which made me not rate this movie with a 10 stars rating) is that at most times, it's very unreal. These are things you surely would put at the bottom of the list of things that are very likely to happen in real life. Sure this is a movie, a story, but sometimes it's almost so unreal, it almost makes us feel we're watching some sort of a fantasy in the present time.Well, there's not much to say about this movie, without spoiling some stuff, so I'll quit it here. All I have to say is that this is a great movie, with great performances (specially Tom Hanks'), a great direction and great scenarios. Catherine Zeta-Jones is also as great in this movie as she's beautiful. You won't regret watching this movie. Just don't expect to see situations of everyday's life.",9,1,2,27 June 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," Few movies need few words like The Silence Of The Lambs.
","**** out of ****Awesome would say it all. This movie is brilliant as it shows two actors in great performances like Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. But these two have become so overrated, that we even, sometimes, may forget the others from the great cast, like Ted Levine, Anthony Heald and Brooke Smith, all of them in great performances. I tried to watch this movie for the second time without anything nearby disturbing me like sounds, phone conversations and lights turning on and off. Glad I am as those things didn't happen the first time I watched it, so I could absorb the movie quite well. In conditions like that, I became completely frozen when I saw Hannibal Lecter for the first time, on screen, standing up, still, in that green prisoner outfit, in his prison cell, saying only 'Good Morning'.Well, Hopkins has proved himself he can deliver quite a good performance, whether he stands still or not, whether he's silence of not. The movie features many brilliant scenes like Lecter's escape from his cell in the police department, his conversations with Agent Clarice Starling and the breathtaking few scenes of Catherine Martin screaming for being held hostage by the never ending sinister psychopath, Buffalo Bill, played by Levine.The Silence Of The Lambs' plot is one many people might already know. But this review, of course, like all my others, are intended to be read by people who have already watched the movie. Foster goes on an assignment to meet Hannibal Lecter and take from him clues in order to catch the assassin. But Lecter gives Starling the chance for them to perform the 'quid pro quo', which suggests that whenever he gives her information, she will have to tell him about her life. This makes character developing take place in most of the entire movie.This won 5 Oscars, as I think it deserved. The only thing I didn't like in it was when Foster withdrew her pistol in order to arrest Buffalo Bill, as she did it very slow, a minus for a winning performance like Foster's. But that's the only bad thing about this movie. What counts is the presence of professional people like Foster, Hopkins, Smith, Levine, and of course, the director Jonathan Demme.",10,3,5,8 August 2005
X2: X-Men United," The evolution of Bryan Singer along with the mutants!
","***1/2 out of ****This time, Bryan Singer has proved that he is much more talented directing a sequel for the X-Men series. The first one was alright, but the second movie is superb. You don't get to know many more characters (at least from the comic books), only the Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), whose make-up make him much more different and strange than in GoldenEye, where he plays the hacker Boris. But you get to know more characters who help in the plot analysis like William Striker (Brian Cox) and others. What really makes X2 a much more fun movie than its prequel is not just the action sequences which are not only great, they are much greater than the almost none action from X-Men (2000), but also the plot, which is told in a very better way and the script too. The movie begins much more ambitious than the first one, showing us scenes of attacks like the attack of the Nightcrawler in the white house, the incident in the shopping center and the assault from the Striker's squad in Xavier's teaching school. And not only the film-making of the movie is much greater, but the cast improved a lot their performance, specially Halle Berry, who gets a bigger role as Storm. Rebecca Mijoln-Stamos is much greater as Mystique also, and as sometimes it happens in some movies (like Star Wars - Episode II : Attack Of The Clones [2002], where Anthony Daniels not only plays 3PO but plays some guy in the bar in the beginning of the movie without 3PO's costume), Stamos also plays Grace, the girl who seduces the guard who later gets killed by Magneto by absorbing from his body metal pieces which got inside his body because of Grace's shot in his back. This is really interesting because it shows us that not only the actor or actress can play a better role, but at the same time, can play multiple roles, one with a fantasy costume and another without it. There are also other new actors like Kelly Hu and Aaron Stanford who plays Pyro. There's also bigger participation in the movie by Bobby (Shawn Ashmore). The rest of the cast including Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, James Marsden, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin and others are still here for our happiness. In X2, Striker manages to find a way to control mutants in order to make them do what he wants like when Magneto tells him everything about Xavier's mansion so he can find where Cerebro is. Actually Striker's goal is to make his own Cerebro. After Nightcrawler joins the party, they go to the underground base where Striker is trying to recreate the Cerebro. That leads to more action sequences and more plot analysis. There's also something that goes wrong with Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) at the end of the movie, but this I prefer not to spoil. Overall, X2 is a great sequel and not only I'm looking forward to watch it again, I'm also looking forward for X3. If Singer keeps his job of directing the movies and as the mutants usually do, keep evolving, X3 will surely rock!",8,0,0,5 May 2005
The Matrix," A great sci-fi movie, that maybe almost matches Star Wars.
","**** out of **** What a fantastic movie this one is! I'm so amazed at how the Wachowski Brothers were able to imagine such a creative science-fiction world like this one, probably the most fictitious, unbelievable, strange, yet, interesting futuristic world I've seen in a movie. Perhaps I became even more fascinated with this futuristic world than the computer-generated dream world that is the matrix. The way the story is told is simply brilliant! I can't believe this hasn't even been nominated for a 'best screenplay' written directly for the screen award, but never mind.For me, this might be the next Star Wars. Many will disagree with me, complaining that Star Wars is much more classic, but the Matrix is a huge achievement in science fiction film-making.I really enjoy these post-apocalyptic movies where some kind of disaster has changed humankind's fate forever and now, it's up to them to fight in order to survive in a much more life-challenging world. In The Matrix, people now live miles and miles below the ground, near the earth's core, because the surface is all controlled by machines. Inventive, isn't it? The Matrix is the finest example of how good writing can really create worlds.",10,0,1,5 January 2006
300," Only the beauty of photography and visual effects out-stands in this film.
","Zack Snyder's second picture advances little or doesn't advance at all on the plot, has a poetic, but joyless and objective-less narrative. The movie, based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, emphasizes most of the time on the battle between spartans and persians and also on some spartans war habits. Therefore, the characters are not very well developed and the script is a little repetitive. There is even a sub-plot about despised women power on the senate, but without much context also. The only good quality of the film is its beauty, thanks to the great visual effects, nice photography and good performances (some of them, anyway). Too bad post-production modified Rodrigo Santoro's original voice, making his tone somewhat harder. I guess, in the end, it was necessary for the film.",5,1,3,27 August 2007
Contact," Do you believe in aliens? I do !
","**** out of ****The reason I like sci-fi movies better than fantasy movies (two of the genres which most tells fictional stories) is that the sci-fi movies gives us a vision of the future. It may be about how the world will look like a few years from now or what are we doing at the moment which will result in something even bigger in the future. Contact follows that pattern.Jodie Foster plays Eleanor Arroway, most of the time, called Ellie. Her character is simply amazing, she's a scientist who, since childhood developed interest in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence and communications. To see her working is a delight. I find it really an art to study the outer space, listening to sounds in earphones and marking stars as already checked and negative as a result for alien search.While she meets Palmer Joss, played by Matthew McCounaughey, a theology student, writer and believer of God's existence itself, the movie show us a conflict between science and religion from the point of view of the two characters, since she believes only in science, while he believes in god, but also thinks science is important, although not at a point where you might give your life for it. This movie reminds me a lot of the Dan Brown novel, Angels & Demons. It's about a discovery made by Ellie, concerning life outside our planet. The story unfolds really amazing. Director Robert Zemeckis is one of my favorites. The ending though might surprise people in an unexpected way.I recommend it to any sci-fi freak. This movie is a-must-see.PS.: just for knowledge, I BELIEVE IN LIFE OUTSIDE OUR PLANET.",10,2,5,13 February 2006
The Island," If you can get past some stuff...
","***1/2 out of ****This might be a fun movie, if you get past some things. For example, in the beginning of it, you may not like much, since it's a completely rip-off of George Lucas' THX-1138 (1971) where there's also a controlled society living in an underground city, with more rules than privileging, and everyone is dressed on white. I like to think that this wasn't an imitation of THX at all, but a remake of the movie, at the same time, with the originality of a new movie. People might think that Michael Bay wanted to do exactly what George Lucas didn't in THX, and that we find out not too late. There's even a scene where we see Ewan McGregor and Sean Bean in a room where Bean is the spiritual and medical helper of McGregor considering his dislodgement of some of the rules in the establishment.The Island is a movie which has high influences on science fictions movies such as THX-1138 (1971), Blade Runner (1982) and even The Matrix (1999). It gets some of the ideas of each of these movies, but adds others too. That's what saved the movie. I must say also that I liked a lot McGregor and Johansson... together. Not performances as somewhat to win an Oscar, but they make a nice couple throughout the movie. The story goes as a society living in an underground city (same thing as THX), where people who live there are monitored everywhere (even in their rooms). Men can't have their rooms in the same sector as the womens'. There's a proximity limit for a man and a woman to obey and in some scenes when Ewan and Scarlett are almost kissing each other, a guard comes nearby and separates them. They live there, because there has been a contamination in the outside world and when they're brought in, they are treated the same way as of The Matrix's, when they're released from a cocoon bag or something like that and start to 'breathe' for the first time. But everything is just a lie made up by the people who control those who live there. They're actually clones of original people who live in the outside world. They are made up, because when a person needs to make a transplant of something, they will need the clones. This is a truly brand new idea in a science fiction movie and The Island scores big in that.In order to like this movie, you must be patient. Don't get frustrated too much on the many, many bizarre action sequences of the movie, or you may dislike it. Specially the one that involves a building and an 'R'. The rest of the cast includes Djimon Hounson, Michael Clarke Duncan and Steve Buscemi in a role most like the others typical of him. His funniest line might be: 'Just because you wanna know from where the hamburgers came from, doesn't mean you wanna meet the cow'. There's a scene involving him and Ewan and Scarlett and there's a dialog exactly the same from one of Blade Runners'. As I said. The Island has many influences on other movies. But as long as it has something new to present, it won't be considering by some as a +1 in the sci-fi genre.",8,0,1,7 August 2005
