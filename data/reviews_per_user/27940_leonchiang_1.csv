Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Seen it, done that....
","If you've have ever seen any one of the Ali G's TV shows, you don't really need to see this movie. It's basically an over-extended version of the TV show, and the worst part is, the amount of thoughts and material they put in the movie seemed enough only for a 15 minute skip. Although the file is style like a documentary, the scenes felt rehearsed and incredulous. The film kept us entertained for the first 20 minutes, but when we started to realize that the movie is going to be the same thing we've already seen on TV over and over again, those of us who were still awake at the end of the movie could only thank heaven it was all over.If you have not seen Ali G TV shows, this movie will probably be fresh and entertaining. But if you know what Ali G is all about, it is safe to skip this movie without any sorrow.",2,7,12,20 March 2007
