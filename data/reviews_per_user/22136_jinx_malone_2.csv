The Blair Witch Project," a lot of nothing for an extremely little scare
","1. see cannibal holocaust first, as the entire conceit of this film is lifted whole from the former.2. i will grant you that the last thirty seconds or however long it takes from 'it's a house' to the very end is chilling. not scary, chilling. 3. sitting through 86 minutes to get to that one little frisson is an unbelievable waste of time. 4. if you happen to be sitting in another room while someone else in your home is watching the film, the constant screaming and moaning which passes for 'plot' in the aforementioned 86 minutes of screen time WILL annoy the other members of your household.don't bother with it. or, just watch the last five minutes. you'll get the entire film, and nicely encapsulated, too. alternately, watch the last broadcast, which also 'pays homage to' i.e. bites cannibal holocaust and is, in my opinion, a scarier film.",3,1,3,31 October 2004
Saw," just crap from beginning to end
","i'll tick this off on my fingers, something i like to do when a film sucks so horrifically that i find myself shouting at the television in frustration.yes, i saw it at home.anyhow.1. ripoff/remake of seven (i refuse to type that title the way i should), another crap 'chiller'.2. cary elwes--please stop acting.3. cops. you have guns. the guy in the death machine? stop screaming at each other unnecessarily and do something about blowing the thing apart. oh, well.4. everything in this film is predicated on people behaving in the stupidest possible fashion, doing things they would never do. i understand that this is the basis of some great horror films, but this is not a great horror film. 5. ending? you'll see it coming a mile away. anyone who doesn't should turn in their 'movie viewer's deluxe' card and go back to watching love, actually or some crikey like that.6. cinematography--people, stop shooting movies in this way. it is not fun to look at, it is not conducive to an exciting filmic experience, it is style (bad) with nothing behind it. i grew up with mtv, but i don't watch it anymore, so new directors--stop taking your cues from it, thanks.7. leigh whannel is not a good writer or actor--thanks for that big fat ego, sticking yourself in there, guy. if you want to see good horror--and this is not it, despite what the publicity machine wants you to believe--then stop giving money to people like this. please. go rent the original Texas chainsaw massacre or dawn of the dead or shivers instead. anything but this crap.happy halloween!",1,1,3,31 October 2004
