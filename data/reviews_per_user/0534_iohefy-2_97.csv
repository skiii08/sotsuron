Kill Bill: Vol. 2," WHAT A VIOLENT MESS
","I did not see Kill Bill # 1 and after to seeing Kill Bill Volume 2 I am glad that I did not. The story was far fetched and very violent.  The only thing I can say for Uma Thurman is that she had to be in pretty good physical shape to perform all the junk she did in the movie. I don't know what todays audience thinks is entertainment, but this certainly was not on that list.  I guess that there will be fans that will go see anything that is up on the screen, but in my humble opinion I would not go see another Tarantino movie because I think that he is way overrated.  My opinion is skip this one, in a lineup of poor movies.",2,1,5,13 April 2004
The Legend of Bagger Vance," If you like golf you will love this movie
","Went to a preview of this movie and was pleasantly surprised at a nice story, and the acting was excellent.  Will Smith gave a moving performance, and as always Matt Damon gave a fine performance.  Charlize was very good as well and she is one beautiful woman.  As in the past Robert Redford did a fine job of directing.",7,0,1,24 October 2000
Walk the Line," Well sung movie
","I can truthfully say that I am not one of the late Johnny Cash's biggest fans, but went to see this movie, because my wife wanted to see it. I still can take or leave Johnny Cash, but I was impressed with the singing of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. I saw interviews with Reese Witherspoon and she said she could not sing a note before signing up for this movie, but they taught her as well as Joaquin Phoenix to sing, and I must say they did an excellent job in this movie. Whether you are a fan of Johnny Cash or not go see this entertaining movie, you will certainly enjoy the talents of this two fine singers. It is well worth the price of admission.",8,0,0,11 March 2006
Catch Me If You Can," FAST PACED MOVIE - BUT NOTHING EXCEPTIONAL
","Tom Hanks is his usual great self, but I think that Leonardo Di Caprio was miscast in this role.  The story was hard to believe, if you did not know that it was an actual true story.  I think someone a little older would have made the part more believable.  Go see it, it is entertaining.",7,0,0,31 December 2002
Marie Antoinette," Worst in a long time.
","This movie was the worst movie I have seen in a long time, with below par acting, poor cast selection, but the one thing positive that I can say for it is the costumes and scenery were the best part of the picture. What puzzeles me is how the films director and writer came to put rock and roll in the movie as well as a love ballad from this time in history. First off Kirstin Dunst was miscast in the roll, as well as a bland performance by Jason Schwartzman. This is one of the few times that I could not wait for the movie to end and it seemed an eternity. My advise is to pass this one by and go see something that is worth while. This one is just a waste of time and money.",3,1,3,23 March 2007
Deja Vu," Mixed Emotions
","Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors and I have enjoyed most all the movies he has appeared in. When I saw his DVD of Deja Vu I grabbed it to watch at home. I have mixed emotions about this film, as overall the plat was somewhat different from the ordinary, it really was not my cup of tea. The special effects in this movie were great but the story with all it science fiction was really not my cup of tea. I could not keep up with the back and forth of the time machine. Overall I enjoyed the movie but it was hard to keep up with all the sci-fi plats performed by the cast. If you like sci-fi movies you will enjoy this film. It is worth watching. Enjoy!!!",7,3,5,30 June 2007
Minority Report," SPEILBERG AND CRUISE MISS THE BOAT ON THIS ONE
","Just because the screen credits read Steve Speilberg and Tom Cruise, does not a great picture make.  I went to see this with an open mind and walked out half way through the picture.  It was so far fetched that I could not take any more.  The motions and gyrations that Tom Cruise went through in many scenes was way out there somewhere.  My recommendation is to pass on this one, but most people WILL go see it because of the the above mentioned two.  Good Luck!",4,1,4,25 June 2002
Finding Neverland," A Pure Delight
",This is an outstanding performance by Johnny Depp in this delightful life story of J. M. Barrie. I have liked Johnny Depp in most all his film work and his performance is deserving of and Academy Award. Johnny Depp is a versatile actor who excels in most any roll that he plays. I just can't say enough for his performance. Kate Winslet as the mother of the boys that Barrie associated with was more than adequate. The one that nearly stole the movie away from Johnny Depp was the child actor Peter Davies. His acting was like he had been in rolls like this for many years. He is precious. This is on my top ten list for the year 2004 and should be on your list as well.,9,3,3,23 December 2004
Training Day," WHAT A WASTE OF TALENT
",Denzel Washington is a great actor and to see him spewing four letter words throughout the length of this picture is not what I expected to see.  I don't mind the occasional four letter+ words once in a while but that was the major part of the words spoken. It is a shame that the studios have to inject this into movies to draw the young people.  What has happened to just entertainment????,5,1,12,1 October 2001
Meet the Parents," WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE
","I have not laughed so much in a long time.  This film is a winner and DeNero and Stiller are outstanding in their parts. It is a cute movie with very little sex, but just good acting.It you want to see a movie that is very funny and well acted go see MEET MY PARENTS.",8,1,1,20 September 2000
Monster," ACADEMY AWARD PERFORMANCES BY THERON & RICCI
",Two academy award performances by Theron and Ricci made this picture very enjoyable.  A lot of violence made this screen play very depressing and could have focused on her life story leading up to the unfortunate ending to this story.  Overall I liked it very much and the transformation of Charleze to the lead character was amazing.,7,0,0,3 February 2004
The Rookie," A VERY NICE LITTLE MOVIE
","It was nice to go see a movie with no sex, no cuss words and just a good story.  A movie of this calibre is rare nowadays, with most having a poor story but lots of sex and violence.  It is nice to be able to take the WHOLE FAMILY to see an entertaining movie with very good acting by the whole cast. GO SEE IT.",8,3,3,2 May 2002
Two for the Money," wow
",A friend called this afternoon telling me she had a ticket for a preview showing of Two For The Money and since there was nothing on television I accepted the invite. What a pleasant surprise this film was. The acting by Al Pacino (who is always outstanding) and Matthew McConaughey was just great. This is the kind of film that I love and is action packed and is a story that is different from the junk that Hollywood is turning out now a days. This is the finest film that I have seen and shows what a fine actor Matthew McConaughey is. Not to be forgotten Rene Russo was very good in her part as Al Pacino's wife. Go see this one it is well worth the price of admission. Can't wait for the DVD to add this to my collection. Enjoy!!!!,8,10,27,5 October 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Looooong and not as good as the original
",After seeing the first Pirates of the Carribbean movie I was excited to see Johnny Depp repeat his performance in this second version of the movie. Once again the writers of this second version fell flat on their face with the story. First off this movie was way to long running for two and a half hours. Could have chopped off at least a half hour. The only thing positive about this overlong version was the special effects which were very good. Johnny Depp gave a very good performance as well as several members of the cast who I am not familiar with previously. Your best best would be to watch the original version of Pirates of the Carribbean again and pass this one up. If you have to see it despite my warnings get the DVD and save yourself the price of admission.,5,4,9,28 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," AN ENTERTAINING COUPLE OF HOURS
","This was not a Errol Flynn or Tyrone Power sea story, but it was entertaining.  Johnny Depp gives a good performance, as only Depp can do. The photography was very well done although the story was a little dragged out.  This one could wait for DVD or VHS.",7,0,1,4 August 2003
The Notebook," A WOMAN'S FLICK BUT VERY WELL DONE
","I went to see this movie to make my wife happy as I had heard that it was a woman's movie.  I am glad that I did go, because the story was an excellent one and the acting above all was great by Alli and Noah, both as youngsters and as oldsters. James Garner (although older and chubbier) and Gena Rowlands were an excellent addition to this film. Gena Rowland's should be proud of her son for great direction. It is not too late go see this fine film, in this day of shoot em ups, and special effects.",10,0,0,12 July 2004
Billy Elliot," Nice little picture!!!
","This was a pleasant little surprise.  I went to see this film and did not know what to expect.  It was a cute story and the youngster who played Billy Elliot was excellent in the part as well as his father and dance instructor. If you want to see a movie that is DIFFERENT from the general movies showing today, go see Billy Elliot.  It is not for everyone, but very pleasant.",7,0,0,28 September 2000
The Others," WELL ACTED BUT A LITTLE DRAGGED OUT
","Nicole Kidman is an excellent actress and the rest of the cast is very good. I found that this story dragged out a little for a ghost story. I do not know whether it was the theater I was in, but the sound track was so low in volume that I had to strain to hear Ms. Kidman dialogue. It seems that we are having a rash of 'The Sixth Sense'.",7,0,0,13 September 2001
Troy," FIRST BLOCKBUSTER OF 2004
","I went to see Troy expecting to see a spectacular Roman movie. I was disappointed with this spectacular, as outside of the massive extras used in the battle scenes, the movie was very ordinary. Brad Pitt was adequate in his role, and Helen was a beautiful young actress.  The story was long and drawn out in spots and was over long. Once again I go back to the Ben Hur, Quo Vadis of the 50's and 60' when I guess the writers were better.  It is worth seeing but don't get too excited about this one, as it leaves a lot to be desired.",6,0,3,10 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," excellent but long film
","Went to see this much acclaimed film last night and really enjoyed it very much despite its length. The acting on the part of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal was outstanding and they were fully believable. I felt the scenery in this picture was beautiful and look forward to taking a trip out to this part of the country. As much as I liked the acting I felt that toward the end of this film it could have been cut down in length, as it started to drag as the story continued.If you want to see an outstanding job of acting and beautiful scenery go pronto to see this film, I promise you will enjoy it. It should get Best Picture award at the Oscar ceremonies. It is well worth the price of admission or added to you DVD collection when it is released.",7,8,13,16 February 2006
Insomnia," WELL ACTED MOVIE, BUT HAVE SEEN THE PLOT BEFORE
","Al Pacino is his usual self in the suspenseful movie, and Robin Williams and Hillary Swank do a good job as well.  Have seen this plot before, or one very similar, but this one has a kicker at the end. It is an entertaining two hours and think you will enjoy it.",7,0,0,20 May 2002
Zodiac," Mixed Emotions
","Saw this movie last night and I have mixed emotions about this film. I wanted to see this movie when it was in the movie theater, but did not make it and was happy to see it on DVD. I brought it home and enjoyed the movie very much with an outstanding cast. There were many in and outs in this movie and it had a tendency to lose you, but I held on despite the twists and turns. When the credits came up I was disappointed to find out that the actual murderer had never been caught and this left the film up in the air for me. I have mixed emotions in recommending this film to anyone. Go at your own risk. Hope this review does not confuse anyone, as I think it may be judged in many ways. Looking forward to seeing some other reviews that come in to IMDb.",7,0,0,31 August 2007
The Prestige," Outstanding acting performances worth price of admission
","I went to see a critics preview of The Prestige this afternoon and to  my surprise I found the film to be one of the best I have seen all year  so far, and that writers can come up with an excellent script it they  would only try a little harder. The acting performances by Hugh  Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in  a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a  little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film  and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the  way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for  some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as  soon as you can, you will not be disappointed.",9,570,745,16 October 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Well Acted Film for the strong of heart
","This film is a documentary of man's inhumanity to man and is a very disturbing film. Don Cheadle is very good in his part and is certainly worthy of nomination for an Academy Award, although I do not think his performance is as good as Leonard DeCaprio in the Aviator or Jamie Foxx who was Ray in the movie of the same name. The rest of the cast was very good in their parts, but I was disappointed in the bit part that Nick Nolte had in this fine picture. It is a shame to see some one so talented have his career go down the tubes because of a drinking problem. You have to have a strong stomach to watch this film but if you do you will be richly rewarded. We need more of the fine writing that is done in this film Hotel Rwanda. Go see this one you will be richly rewarded.",8,2,2,16 February 2005
We Were Soldiers," VERY FINE AND GORY WAR STORY
","We were fortunate enough to have Col. Moore at the preview here in Charlotte tonight, and I am sure that his chest inflated with pride at the showing. Mel Gibson gave his always fine performance and although the scenes were gory, (thats war) the reinactment was very realalistic.  If you like another look at war this is a more personal look at the lives of our combat soldiers, as opposed to Black Hawk Down which did not get into the lives of the soldiers.  The main characters in the cast did a fine job, including Madelaine Stowe, Sam Elliot (minus the mustache) and the improving Greg Kinnear.",8,0,0,27 February 2002
Ocean's Twelve," Nothing like the original
","It has been some time since I saw Oceans 11, and I really enjoyed it. When I heard that Oceans 12 was coming I was really looking forward to seeing the movie. Well I went to the sneak preview here in Charlotte, and to say that I was disappointed is mild. It would seem that when a second version of a story comes out it is no where as good as the original. They certainly had the stars to draw people into the movie, like Brad Pitt, George Clooney,Julia Roberts and the addition of Catherine Zeta Jones. These stars did nothing to help with a weak story. This is another on a long list of 'wait for the video to come out' you will save the price of admission",6,2,4,23 December 2004
Crash," A so so movie
","I sat down to watch this movie with and open mind, and after watching it for a while I could not get my mind to keep up with all the different stories this film was taking. I guess I do not like movies that are tell 5 or 6 different stories and switching back in forth between all of them constantly The acting was good by the cast which included Sondra Bullock, Matt Dillion and many others familiar faces. Overall the picture was good, but the story line switching drove me nuts. I would not recommend this movie to my good friends, but might to my enemies. If you have to see this picture, get the DVD and pocket the price of admission.",6,5,11,26 January 2007
Closer," What a disappointment!!
","I have voted to give this movie a six, not for the story, but for the acting by the star studded cast. Jude Law (the everywhere mane) is very good, as well as the rest of the cast which consists of Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman and Clive Owen. With a cast like this how can you go wrong, well it did as far as I am concerned. I am no prude, but the dialog in this movie was excessive, and about 2/3 through the picture I had enough and got up and walked out. I can see the point of mixed relationships, and how a story can develop from it, but the sexual theme got out of hand. As far as I am concerned this one is a video store selection and should be for you too.",6,0,1,23 December 2004
Capote," Great Acting - Slow Moving
","I eagerly went to see Capote as I had heard how great the acting was. Philip Seymout Hoffman was Capote himself, and did an outstanding job in his portrayal of Capote. I could not believe how well he carried the role, with the speech and actions. The whole cast was excellent and especially Clifton Collins Jr. who played one of the killers. The only objection I found with this wonderful film was it was very slow moving and seemed at times to drag out somewhat. If you want to see an outstanding performance and not mind it dragging at times, it is worth the price of admission. Go see this one. There should be some awards for Hoffman when Acadmey Awards are given out.",7,0,0,18 November 2005
The Devil Wears Prada," Delightful Movie
","We have heard nothing but raves for this delightful movie and decided to see for ourselves. All that we had heard was well deserved and we enjoyed this funny romp very much. The fine acting of Meryl Streep was outstanding as well as the fine job by the always talented Stanley Tuchi as well as the good job done by the Co-Star Anne Hathaway. Meryl Streep looked great in that hair color and she should convert to that color as her regular color. Emily Blunt who played Emily in the movie was also very good and I loved the accent. I you would like a light hearted romp, run don't walk to see his fine movie, you will not be sorry. We need more movies like this one.",8,0,0,12 July 2006
Bridget Jones's Diary," Renee a big improvement over Nurse Betty
",This movie is a pleasant improvement over Nurse Betty.  Renee does an outstanding job of managing an English accent though out the movie.  The is no lapse of accent and you would believe that she is a English young woman. The story is cute although the use of four letter words excessive.  This is not an academy award movie it is a pleasant hour and a half.,7,0,0,6 April 2001
The Aviator," Di Caprio is excellent in this film
","I thought that Leonard DiCaprio was excellent in Titanic, but has been less than spectacular in all the movies I saw him in since. But he has turned in another excellent performance in The Aviator. His gestures in this movie was excellent as well as his overall performance. His dark hair and mustache made him look just like Howard Hughes. This movie although long should boost Leonard's film career and he should be in the running for an Academy Award. I also thought that Kate Blanchett was excellent as Kate Hepburn as well as the rest of the cast. It was a pleasant surprise to see Leonard in a complex role. Go see this movie as it is well worth the price of admission.",8,1,3,4 January 2005
The Bourne Identity," A WELL WRITTEN FAST PACED TWO HOURS
",I really enjoyed this fast paced spy thriller.  Matt Damon again gave a believable performance.  He is becoming one of my favorite movie actors. This story kept you on the edge of your seat and the car chases were exciting and well done.  It is my highest recommendation that you go see this nail biter.,9,0,1,19 June 2002
The Italian Job," FAST PACED EXCITING MOVIE
","I went to see THE ITALIAN JOB with mixed reviews in my head.  I was pleasantly surprised with an entertaining close to 2 hours.  I thought the cast was just great and so were the special effects, with the safe and truck just dropping out of sight.  If you like fast paced action movies, this is the one to see.",8,56,89,26 June 2003
Radio," NICE LITTLE MOVIE
","Cuba Gooding is excellent as usual and Ed Harris gives another good performance, but this is the usual Southern football coach who stands up for the brain damaged little guy, and stands up for him with the team bully. There is nothing outstanding in the story, but the acting makes up for it. Nice to see Debra Winger back on the screen again.",6,0,1,22 October 2003
The Hills Have Eyes," My eyes walked out on this mindless film
","I like a horror movie as well as the next guy, but this was the worst movie of it's kind I have ever seen. I went to see it with an open mind, but I just could not take it any longer, so I upped and walked out of this movie after twitching in my seat for a little over an hour. My suggestion for anyone proposing to see this sad film, should just forget it and if you want to see it so badly, rent the DVD which should be out very shortly. This was a total waste of film and the acting was pretty bad as well. Just a thought, how did the camper stay lighted with no source of electricity in the desert????? Must have been some heavy duty batteries in that camper.",1,2,5,29 March 2006
Cold Mountain," FINE ACTING - FINE STORY
",I went to see the preview of COLD MOUNTAIN tonight and both Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger do an excellent job in their parts.  Jude Law is fine in his part of a civil war Confederate soldier who is fighting to return to his home in Cold Mountain and his love Nicole. The story is a fine one enhanced by excellent acting.  This movie should collect many of the Academy Awards next year.,10,1,1,18 December 2003
Little Miss Sunshine," Silly Little Movie
","I went to see the preview last night with an open mind as I had not heard much about this movie. I was not familiar with most of the cast, with the exception of Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin and Tonni Colletti, who were all very good in their parts. The brother and the Uncle were equally as good in their part. It is a story of a family who at the last minute hear that their daughter Olive has won here beauty contest and qualifies for an entry into the Little Miss Sunshine contest being held in California. This is the story of their adventures traveling from New Mexico to California in an old Volkeswagon bus. The sound track was hard to hear as there was so much laughter during the movie. My recommendation is if you don't want a movie with a long message and just want an evening out with not to much thinking this is the movie for you. Enjoy",6,2,17,18 August 2006
The Patriot," A GREAT PERIOD PIECE OF FILM
","I enjoyed this film very much.  Maybe now some of the younger people will now know about the history of this great country.  Mel continues to amaze me with his scope.  I think that if the picture does not win the Academy Award, certainly Mel should be a top nominee for the award.  The picture was very well done and close to fact.",9,1,2,5 July 2000
Van Helsing," NOT WHAT IT WAS CRACKED UP TO BE
","I went to see the preview of this flat film and was totally dis- appointed in the slow moving film. I remember the Boris Korloff and Bela Lagosi originals and they scared me out of my wits. The cast in this movie left a lot to be desired.  What has happened to the writers now days, and they do not seem to have the talent to write a decent screen play. This tale of Frankenstein should have been left alone, and they say newer is better.  Not in this case.",5,0,0,11 May 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," So So
","After seeing the TV promo's on this movie the scenes show looked funny, so I went to see this movie last night. What they showed on Television were still funny, but for the most part the movie was very crude and got boring after the first 15 minutes. Once again what has happened to the writer's of the past. Either they make repeats of old movies or television series or they turn out crap like this movie. I as a male enjoy seeing sexy movies, but this one was the bottom of the barrel. The only really funny scene is when our hero was having excess hair removed from his chest. Pass this one by and I would even think about buying the DVD that should be out very very soon. I don't know what the critics were thinking when they gave this film thumbs up.",5,9,17,14 September 2005
Jarhead," True to life movie
","I went to see this preview not knowing much about this movie. I was pleasantly surprised at how factual this movie was. Not having been to the desert but did serve in World War One the actions of the crew at play and during action brought back memories for me. I am not to familiar with Jake Gyllenhaal but I think he did an outstanding job in this movie. What can I say about Jamie Foxx, he again gave a terrific performance as he did in Ray. If you want to see a movie that is close to fact, go see this outstanding movie, you will not be sorry. This movie should win some awards when they are given out next year. It is not for everyone, but if you like a good war story go see it.",8,5,9,10 November 2005
Collateral," I FOR ONE DID NOT LIKE THE MOVIE
","I am a big Tom Cruise fan and went to see this preview with much enthusiasm but found that I was disappointed. He looked good with the gray hair, but the story was a real nothing. Jamie Fox gave a good performance in this lack luster movie, as wellas Tom Cruise. When you have a story that really has no body to it, I think it makes for a weak picture.  I know most people like violence in their movies, but enough is enough.  Tom may have enjoyed his evening, but let me tell you I did not.",5,0,0,12 August 2004
Ocean's Eleven," FAST PACED AND EXCITING TWO HOURS
",This remake of the Rat Pack movie is one worth seeing.  The large cast does a fine job of pulling it off.  The electronic gadgets and just the action of the whole film is worth going to see.  This one definetly compares with the old Frank Sinatra film.  Be prepared for an entertaining two hours.,9,0,0,4 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," LOVE FIRST AND PEARL HARBOR SECOND
","It was a long movie and rather disappointing.  It was more a love story than the actual bombing of Pear Harbor.  It took an hour and a half to get the the meat of the picture.  The destruction of Pearl Harbor was fantastic in its reality and that was what Pearl Harbor was all about. This movie was more a love story which overshadowed the actual event. The acting was good by all, but this picture was a disappointment to me as far as the script more attention should have been paid to Dec 7, 1941.",6,0,0,23 May 2001
Remember the Titans," Denzel does it again
",A very pleasant and action packed film.  Denzel Washington has done an outstanding job as he always does.  It is a film filled with football and trying to get the races to overcome their faults and bigotry.  The rest of the cast did an outstanding job as well.,8,1,2,26 September 2000
Meet the Fockers," Very pleasant surprise
","I really enjoyed the first movie of this series, and did not know what to expect from the second of the series, judging by past experiences with second of movie series. I was pleasantly surprised as I laughed till my sides hurt. The casting in the movie was excellent, with most of the original cast returning, but it was an excellent choice in Dustin Hoffman, and Barbara Striesend as the parents of our here. Who ever wrote the screen play did a great job in continuing the laughs from the first movie. My suggestion with such junk being turned out at the movies now a days, go see this one if you want a light funny movie that does not have a message for the patron.",8,0,1,13 January 2005
The Pianist," VERY WELL DONE ALTHOUGH A LITTLE LONG
","I enjoyed this movie very much, and the acting was first rate, but it was a little too long.  Adrien Brody was unbelievable while sitting at the piano, and you would swear he was playing the selections played. His performance throughout the movie was very believable and he did deserve the award Hollywood gave him.",7,0,0,14 April 2003
Seabiscuit," VERY WELL DONE
","I thought this would be a horse racing movie, but it was very well done, with subplots and was very well acted by all.  William Macy was very cute in his role, and is enjoyable in the variety of roles he plays.  This one is well worth the price of admission.",8,0,0,29 July 2003
City of God," VIOLENT MOVIE - WHAT A LIFE
","I really don't know what to make of this movie.  It was very well done, but what a hell of life this people live.  It starts at the age of 6 or 7 years and continues us to death.  Seeing children of this age getting guns to protect themselves, or kill someone.  There was more gunfire in this movie then in World War 2.  Go see it, but you have to have a strong stomach for violence.",6,2,9,13 February 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," BEAUTIFULLY ACTED AND FILMED MOVIE - DON'T MISS IT
","The quality of this movie is amazing.  The cinamatography was beautiful, and the scenery was breathtaking.  The action sequences had me sitting up in my seat.  This is Academy Award material and should be the winner this year. The titles take nothing way from this film.  This is what a movie should be. Go see it!",9,0,0,22 February 2001
Driven," WEAK STORY - SPECTACULAR PHOTOGRAPHY
",Mr. Stallone should stick to his Rocky movies as an actor.  This story is very weak and is slanted towards the racing craze that has enveloped the country.  The filming of the accident sequences are just great.  The only one that should be proud of themsleves are the people behind the cameras. Wait for this one to come to tape and DVD.,4,0,0,25 April 2001
No Man's Land," VERY WELL DONE - WAR IS A WASTE!
","Went to see a preview of this war movie, and it was very well done, and goes to prove that although people cannot get along, there is no benefit to war. This is a touching story of the struggle between two Yugoslavian factions, and how no one wins.  If you can take another war movie this should be added to your list.",8,0,1,14 February 2002
Moulin Rouge!," STRIKE TWO OF THE SUMMER SEASON
","Went to see this movie with an open mind, and boy was I disappointed. This takes place in the 1800's and the music is rock and roll.  This is the second movie I have seen of the summer 'BLOCKBUSTERS', the other being Pear Harbor.  I have sent my comments in on Pear Harbor, as I was disappointed with the story in that movie.  All I can say is I am glad that Jose Ferrer is not around to see this silly movie.  The only nice thing I can say about it was the colors were beautiful.  If you insist on seeing this poor imitation, save yourself some money and wait for it to come to the video store!!!!!",5,0,0,30 May 2001
The Illusionist," Finely a well written and acted movie.
","My wife and I went to see The Illusionist not really knowing what to expect. Well finally a well written story to sit and enjoy for nearly two hours. The cast which included Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, were very good and Jessica Biel was adequate in her part as the love interest. This movie had a surprise ending which I will not tell you about, as it would ruin the movie for you. With all the trash that Hollywood is turning out these days it was a relief to see a well written story, and no slapstick acting by some teen age actor. I would recommend this film to anyone who is an adult and enjoys a great story and good acting. Please Hollywood let's have more of this quality film.",10,3,4,21 September 2006
Men in Black II," SAME OLD THING
","I liked Men in Black, but I think they stretched themselves with this one. It is a shame that hype gets people to go see this far fetched movie.  I guess that the studios make II and III and on and on.  Weak story, but this is what the public wants and they are getting more and more of it.  I would say pass on this one.",5,0,0,8 July 2002
Wimbledon," A NICE LITTLE MOVIE
","This is a nice little movie about a British tennis star who is on his way out and the young female American star who goes to Wimbledon and the events that lead to her helping him become the star of the tourney. The acting is fine by Kirstin Dunst and Paul Bettney, and as always Sam Neill was very good in his part, although a small one. The one thing I will say about the movie that I liked were the tennis tournaments as they were very well played or both Dunst and Bettney had plenty of tennis lessons for this movie. Go see it if you like a light movie with no real message.",6,0,2,20 October 2004
Million Dollar Baby," wow what a movie
","I am glad that I do not have to choose the Academy Award for best picture of the year, as it would be a hard choice picking between Ray and Million Dollar Baby. The cast was outstanding with Hillary Swank, giving another stellar performance, as well as Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman. The direction by Clint Eastwood was very good as this performance was as good as I have ever seen Eastwood. It has been a long time since I have been to a preview that the audience got up at the end of the picture and applauded. In my opinion I agree with the ovation. I think that I would pick Million Dollar Baby as my pick for the Academy Award, not only for the fine acting, but the story itself.",10,2,5,24 January 2005
Garden State," DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT
","My wife and I went to see this movie not knowing what to expect. She was pleasantly surprised and I was surprised. I thought the acting was very good by all the actors in this movie I was confused as to the story line and where the plot was going and it took most all the picture to figure out what was happening.Natalie Portman was very good in this movie, as she has been in everything that I have seen her in. This is the first work I have seen with Braff, but his performance was heart warming for most of the picture. With all the junk being turned out by the Hollywood studios, this was a refreshing change.",7,0,0,17 September 2004
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Excellent portrayal of a shameful era in U.S. history
",I am old enough to remember the Morrow/McCarthy era and was excited to go see this fine film. George Clooney has written an excellent portrayal of the era in our history. I was spellbound by the performance of David Strathairn as Morrow. He nailed the role perfectly as well as the rest of the cast doing a fine job. By filming this in black and white it brought more reality to the period. Even the performance by Diane Reeves fit perfectly in the the film I cannot recommend this to highly to anyone who has not live through this era of Mc Carthyism and the unfair treatment of so many innocent people. Rush off to see this fine film if you are not familiar with the era.,9,5,9,22 November 2005
Mission: Impossible II," fast paced two hours
",This was a movie with star power in having Tom Cruise.  I saw the original MI and thought this one was far superior.  I did get tired of the multi-faced actors in the movie.  Plenty of action and blow em ups.  I still liked the old TV series which were not as spectacular but were extremely enjoyable.  Go see it you will enjoy.,7,1,3,1 June 2000
World Trade Center," Accurate reproduction
","Although I spent hours watching the actual event on television, this film had a tendency to drag in parts. Particularly with the scenes where the police were trapped in the ruble of the World Trade Center. I thought the acting was very good throughout the picture, but the dark scenes were draggy. I think it could have switched to the other events more often than just voices in the dark. I watched Flight 93 and enjoyed it more if you can say enjoyed. It is a gripping couple of hours and for the most part was close to the actual facts. I you want to see this event again then overall I think you will enjoy the acting of Nicklas Gage and the rest of the cast most of whom I was not familiar with. It is an entertaining two hours.",5,0,3,13 February 2007
Big Fish," WHAT A DELIGHTFUL STORY AND SUPERB ACTING
","This certainly was a change of pace from the movies put out nowadays. Albert Finney is one of our finest actors, and it is sad to see him getting older, when he was a delight in his early film with Audrey Hepburn ONE FOR THE ROAD.  The two hours went fast and the direction was excellent.  Go see this one if you want a movie that is not a shoot em up, blow em up movie.",8,0,0,22 January 2004
Blood Diamond," So So Movie
","I went to see this movie with some reservations, as I am not to crazy about Leonardo DiCaprio in any of his roles since Titanic. I should have followed my instincts so I sat through this 2 plus hours movie. The outstanding job of acting was by Djimon Hounson who played the role of the fisherman who found the blood diamond and spent the great part of the picture trying to reunite with his family. Jennifer Connelly was good in her role and pleasure to look at. My recommendation to you is to pass this one by or if you have to see it, wait for the film to come out on DVD which should be shortly. You can live without this one dimensional performance by Di Caprio.",5,0,10,25 January 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Two different opinions
","I went last night with my wife to see Pride and Prejudice because she wanted to see it so badly. As listed in the summary above we had different opinions of this well acted movie. I thought the story was a good one and the acting of Keira Knightley as the main love interest, and the mother Brenda Blethyn was outstanding. I thought that the acting by Matthew Mac Fadyen was stiff and had no body to it what so ever. On the other hand my wife thought all the acting was very good and liked the story very much. I know that this will not help in making a decision to see this film, but this is the honest opinion of two different people. Good Luck which ever way you go.",6,2,3,30 November 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," WORST MOVIE OF THIS YOUNG YEAR.
","I am not the biggest Jim Carey fan in the world but I liked his last movie and figured I would give this one a try.  I have read the reviews of this movie and I for one cannot figure out why I disliked this movie so much.  I will have to hand it to Jim Carey and Kate Winslet for good job of acting, but I could not make head nor tail of this movie.  After an hour I had to walk out, and yet the critics are praising this movie to the sky.  Maybe it is because I am older and I like a movie that is entertaining and is not a message sender. I glad I saw it at a preview and did not pay for it, and as far as I am concerned I would suggest skipping this one, but if you got to see it, RENT IT.",2,0,2,26 March 2004
The World's Fastest Indian," Pleasant Surprise
","Saw this movie not knowing what to expect, but I do love anything that Anthony Hopkins has done, and this one is no exception. The title is a little deceiving as the Indian is a motorcycle which surprised me . This is the story of a man's dream and the fulfilment of it. Anthony Hopkins is outstanding as Burt Monro who travels from New Zeland to the Bonneville Salt Flats to break the worlds speed record on a motorcycle. This movies is both funny and moving throughout. All though not many in the cast familiar they all did a fine job. If you want to see a movie with excellent acting by all, then don't miss this sleeper. It is well worth the price of admission.",9,0,0,30 January 2007
The Last Samurai," WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE
","This 2 1/2 hour epic is a real surprise.  Tom Cruise does an outstanding acting job, the the story is fast paced and very well done. This is the best Cruise movie I have seen in ages.  The time just fly by and the audience stood up and applauded as the movie was ending. Go see this one you will certainly enjoy.",9,1,2,25 November 2003
Invincible," Nice little movie
","Watched this movie last night and overall I thought it to be entertaining. Mark Wahlberg did a good job of the football dreamer who loved the Philadelphia Eagles football team and dreamed of playing for them. When Dick Vermiel announced that they were holding openings for no pro's Wahlberg applies and because he is a talented player he makes the team. Elizabeth Banks is a fresh new face and did an adequate job in Invinceable. The football scenes in the movie were very realistic and if you are an Eagles fan you will enjoy it very much. The more I see Gregg Kinnear in movies the more respect I have for his acting talents. If you like football, you will enjoy this film. I enjoyed the movie very much.",7,0,0,30 January 2007
National Treasure," Not one of Nickolas Cage's best
","I had seen the coming attractions of this movie and it looked pretty exciting, so when tickets arrived for the preview I made sure to go. This was not one of Nick's better movies, and I do not recommend it to any of his fans, as it is a disappointment. It is far fetched as Nick's crew attempts to get a document out of Washington that has the key to a treasure map. This is the sad story of their adventures attempting to get this document. In competition with Nick is a former buddy of his who has turned to be a bad seed and also attempts to beat Nick to the document. This also is a way out far fetched movie and hold off for the video store. It is a waste of money.",5,0,0,23 December 2004
Inside Man," Different kind of Bank robbery film
","Went to see the preview of this bank robbery film, expecting to see just another in a line up of bank robbery film, but was pleasantly surprised at the twists and turns of this movie. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors and was not expecting to much. Well I was pleasantly surprised at the story with it's unexpected surprises. I thought that Jodie Foster was wasted in her part, but that Clive Owen was very good in his part as the bank robber leader. The only objection I found was that the run time for the movie was a little long, but other than that I did enjoy the movie very much, and I recommend this movie for those that like a good story, with a little to much sitting time.",7,3,4,23 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Mixed vote on this one.
","My wife and I went to see The Da Vinci Code last night, as she had read the book and wanted to see the picture. I tagged along as I had heard so many mixed reviews of the movie. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the movie, although not as much as she enjoyed the book. I am not a religious person and really I thought it was dragged out quite a bit. I like the acting performances of Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou who I had not seen before this film, but the outstanding job done by Ian Mc Kellen was just great. I also liked the acting job done by Paul Bettany. My advice is go see it if you like religious picture but skip it if you do not.",6,1,2,14 June 2006
Mystic River," WHAT GREAT ACTING PERFORMANCES BY WHOLE CAST
","This is my kind of picture with outstanding acting performances by Sean Penn and the whole cast down to Marcia Gay Harden.  The picture was rather involved as far as the story line goes, but the ending came as a complete surprise.  Go see this one as it is great.",9,5,9,14 October 2003
Enemy at the Gates," EXCELLENT STORY WITH ACTING TO MATCH
","Very well done film, with a bit of a love story.  The filming was outstanding in every respect.  It is good to see history so faithfully told. The acting was very well done, but all the English accents were a little misplaced.  This movie is well worth the price of admission.",8,0,1,22 March 2001
A Beautiful Mind," A BEAUTIFUL MIND IS A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE
","What a delightful movie that wisked right by.  Russell Crowe does an excellent job of acting, and it is good to see him back on the big screen. Jennifer Connely is a newcomer as far as I am concerned, and she is a very good actress and very attractive.  This picture is not for everyone, but when the movie was over, the audience applauded, and rightfully so.",9,0,2,20 December 2001
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," What a Bomb
","I went to see this movie to see Anjoline Jolie and Brad Pitt, with the exception of Brad's last two movies which were awful. This 'story' was so weak that it had to be kept going with gimmicks because of no real story line. It seems nowadays that the 'writers' have to cover their poor writing with blow em ups and all kinds of computer images. The only good thing about this movie was Ms. Jolie who is excellent in anything she appears in. Take my advice on this weak weak story and pass by any of the versions of this, whether on the big screen, or on DVD's. Save yourself some money on this bomb and bypass it where ever it is showing.",1,4,9,29 January 2006
The Departed," What great acting
","I waited to see The Departed with antisapation and having just seen it my wait was not in vain.The acting in the movie was the tops, including Leonardo De Caprio, Matt Damon, and of course Jack Nicholson who is great in anything he appears in. Even the bit parts by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin were outstanding. The problem I had with the movie was how similar DiCaprio and Damon looked in this movie, I got sort of confused as to who was who. This is a different kind of cop story and I am sure you will enjoy watching the artistry of this unit of actors in this fine movie. It is the best two hours I have spent in a long time, so go see this outstanding movie and you will certainly enjoy it as much as I did. This is Oscar material for sure.",8,5,10,13 February 2007
Love Actually," CUTE MOVIE - NOT UP TO PAR
","This was a cute movie, but was a confusing mish mash of stories, and the characters were not substantial.  This certainly is not Bridget Jones Diary. The acting was very good by an outstanding cast and I think that Billy Nighy as Billy Mack stole the whole picture.  I'd wait for the video store to see this movie.",5,0,0,10 November 2003
The Last King of Scotland," Great acting job
","I gave this film a 9 for one reason only, Forst Whitaker is the outstanding star of this picture taken from the headlines. I have yet to see a picture with Forest Whitaker that I have not enjoyed, and to continue his string superb acting job this one is one the best I have seen. I am not familiar with most of the cast in the fine picture, but they all did a good job, but when you share the screen with Forest Whitaker he envelopes you with his outstanding acting. I wait with anticipation for each of his new movies. My recommendation would be to go to see this movie if you want to see an Oscar performance by this outstanding actor, don't walk run",9,0,2,19 April 2007
Ray," A Wonderful Performance
","I went along with my wife to see Ray, which she wanted to see very badly, and I went along to keep her happy. We both loved Ray Charles music and renditions. Well I was certainly surprised by the wonderful performance of Jamie Foxx. Although we both liked everything that Ray Charles did in his many years of providing us with wonderful music, we did not realize what an exciting life he led before coming into the spotlight. Whether you like Ray Charles or not it is worth the price of admission to see Jamie Fox portray Ray. Every action and motion that he did was Ray Charles. This is a not to miss movie, and I think that Jamie Fox is deserving of an Academy Award for this film",9,1,2,23 December 2004
The Good Shepherd," Long and drawn out
","I have enjoyed most all of the movies Matt Damon has made and with the supporting cast I looked forward to seeing THE GOOD SHEPHARD. I rented the DVD this week and I was disappointed with the story and it seemed to go on and on. The story kept switching from one time period to another and was totally confusing. While the acting was very good, it seemed that the stars listed for this movie made you want to see it, they like Robert Di Niro and Anjelene Jolie basically had bit parts in the overlong movie. Matt Damon who was vertualy in every scene of the movie did a fine job of acting but Di Niro and Jolie were there for their star power. My recommendation is neither here nor there, so use your own decisive powers on this one. To me I thought the story was a waste of good talent and a poor story line.",5,0,2,6 April 2007
The Terminal," A DELIGHTFUL ROMP
","I went to see this movie with an open mind and all I can say is that I enjoyed it very much.  Tom Hanks is excellent in his part and does a great job with the accent. Stanley Tucci gave another great performance with another different role. Although Tom and Stanley are outstanding in their roles, it is the supporting cast that really steal the picture.  Steven Spielberg did a fine job of directing, and the over two hours really flew by.  My recommendation is go see this movie if you want a few hours of entertainment with no real message",9,0,1,15 June 2004
Music and Lyrics," Silly little movie
","I went to see a preview of this movie last night, and I would say that I enjoyed it to a certain extent, but I think I am getting tired of seeing Hugh Grant playing the same part in a lot of different movies. I think that he is getting a little old for this movie, playing and 80's rock and roller. Drew Barrymore was adequate in her roll. Movies for the most part are being made for the teens and twenty something patrons and anyone who is older is left to seeing this silly little movie. My advise is that if you fall into the above age groups go see it or better yet wait for the DVD (which should be out very shortly. If you are an adult, do your self a favor and pass this one by, it is a teeny bopper's movie.",5,4,12,9 February 2007
The Queen," Well acted documentary
","Went to see the preview of The Queen last night and enjoyed it very much, although I thought it dragged at times. I cannot say enough about the performance of Helen Mirren, who played the Queen. Not only was she great she also looked so much like the queen. The rest of the cast were also fine, although I was not familiar with most of the cast with the exception of James Cromwell. I though that Michael Sheen as Tony Blair did a fine job of acting in a difficult situation. The way the film worked out, it was like a newsreel with snip-its of the inside information that made up the news. A lot of newsreel footage of Diana, made you think a little. I would say that this is a movie that will be enjoyed by females in greater number than the male population.",8,0,2,3 November 2006
Vanilla Sky," GOOD ACTING, GOOD DIRECTING, BUT STRANGE
","Went to see this movie not knowing what to expect.  It was fast paced with very good acting especially by Tom Cruise.  You had to work to keep up with the plot which was very strange.  Mr. Crowe did an excellent directing job, and if you like DEEP movies, this is certainly one of them, and worth seeing for sure.",7,0,0,17 December 2001
Bruce Almighty," PLEASANT, FUNNY MOVIE
","Since I had a pass to the preview of this movie, I went reluctantly to see Jim Carey who I do not particularly like, and figure if it was a typical Carey movie I could walk out and not lose a thing.  I was pleasantly surprised as it was cute.  If you like Jim Carey you will like this movie. Worth the price of admission.",7,1,2,20 May 2003
Casino Royale," Who is Sean Connery?
","I think that Sean Connery was the best James Bond that we have ever had, but I was impressed by the job that Daniel Craig did in this fine film. He is well built, rugged looked and certainly not pretty like so many of the previous James Bonds. I was impressed by his stunt work in the opening sequences if indeed that was him and not a stunt double. I love all the James Bond movies and see them as soon as they come to the big screen and this one is no exception. I look forward to the next one when ever it will be. Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed as a new star is born with Daniel Craig's performance as Agent 007 and you certainly will enjoy the special effects throughout this neat movie.",8,2,7,19 March 2007
Signs," S L O W --- M O V I N G --- M O V I E
","Mel Gibson is one of my favorite actors, but this movie was so slow moving and dragged out.  I found myself fidgeting in my seat and was glad to see the end of this drawn out flick.  Hope Mel will do a better job of picking out his next movie script.  Save this one for the video tape.",5,1,1,7 August 2002
Amélie," A CUTE ROMP THROUGH FRANCE
",I went to see this preview last night and was pleasantly surprised. Audrey Tautou is delightful as Amelie.  The audience was laughing pretty much constantly throughout this delightful movie.  It is nice to come out of a movie without having to have been suggested to some kind of message.  Go see this one for a delightful two hours.,9,1,3,14 November 2001
Munich," A mixed Bag
","I am a big Steven Spielberg fan and have seen most of his pictures that have come to Charlotte, North Carolina. So when it was showing locally I beat a path to the theater. I could not get into the movie in the first half and found some of the dialog very hard to understand. The second half of the movie was much better and I was able to get into the story. For the most part the cast was made up of unknowns with the exception of Geoffrey Rush who played the part of Ephraim in the movie. I thought that Eric Bana who was the main character was very good in his part and look forward to seeing him again in some other feature production. I cannot strongly recommend this movie so go plunk down your money and you decide.",5,0,5,23 June 2006
Shall We Dance," WHAT A DELIGHTFUL MOVIE
","Went to see the preview of SHALL WE DANCE and I haven't enjoyed a movie as much since I went to see CHICAGO. Although I am not a Jo Lo fan the whole cast was superb and the dancing was out of this world. I cannot say enough about Richard Gere who is an accomplished dancer (remember Chicago) and the whole film was just a delight. Stanley Tucci was excellent in his part, as always. Don't just go see this movie, RUN AND GO SEE THIS MOVIE. I could see it again tomorrow. It is nice to come out of the movie withoutthe movie having a message. We need more of this kind of movie. THREE CHEERS FOR A WINNER",8,1,2,4 October 2004
The Replacements," AN ENJOYABLE MOVIE WITH A LOT OF LAUGHS
","I was not expecting too much when I went to see the preview of Replacements, but it was an enjoyable two hour, especially if you like football as I do. The story is rather familiar, but is well done with mostly a cast of unknowns.  This will not get any awards but is lighthearted entertainment.",6,1,2,3 August 2000
Thirteen Days," Riveting Movie
",With a cast of mostly unknowns this is a riveting movie and very well acted. Kevin Costner is excellent in his role and the whole production is one that is well worth the price of admission.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie which kept you on the edge of your seat,8,1,1,8 January 2001
Gangs of New York," GOOD ACTING BY DI CAPRIO AND DAY LEWIS
",This is the best acting job that Leonardo has done in some time.  He was believable in the part despite his baby face.  But the outstanding job was done by Daniel Day Lewis who was sensational in the part.  This was a real extravaganza and was very well acted and written.,8,0,0,2 January 2003
Windtalkers," MIXED EMOTIONS
","I looked forward to going to see this movie, and really have mixed emotions upon seeing it. The outstanding thing about this movie is the explosions, and bodies being hurled all over the place.  Nicolas Cage and Adam Beach give good performances, but are overshadowed by all the action.  I think the movie rolled on to long and could have been cut. The action scenes were realistic and I did enjoy the action, but as I said it carried on too long. If you are a war buff movie goer then go see this, if not wait for the video.  It is not a SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.",6,0,0,17 June 2002
The Bourne Supremacy," FAST PACED CONFUSING FLICK
","This movie was very well done, and the acting was very good. Matt Damon was excellent again in his role as Jason Borne, but the cameras work was driving me nuts.  The constant movement of the camera was driving me out of my mine. I thought the car chase scenes were the best I have seen in a long time. The plot was confusing at times throughout the movie, and only at the end did you get any idea of what was really going on in this movie.  If you like wild car chases in many cities in Europe go see this movie.  It does move along.",8,1,2,20 July 2004
Cinderella Man," Well acted slow movie
","I went to see Cinderella Man with great anticipation, but found that the movie was very well acted, but dragged on and on in many spots. The fight scenes were excellent and I would have sworn that the fight scenes were real, but that was the only exciting part of the film. I realize that you have to tell the story of the hardships that Jim Braddock and his family suffered, but I think this was overdone. I thought the part played by Renee Zelweger was one that could have been played by anyone and was a waste of talent. Paul Giamatti did an excellent job in his part as Braddock's manager. I would recommend this movie to anyone to see, but be prepared to have it drag out in spots. The only thing that saved this movie was the fight scenes. Go see it you will enjoy overall.",7,1,4,21 June 2005
