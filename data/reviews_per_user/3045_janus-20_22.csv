The Expendables 2," ATTENTION, can somebody please claim the body of the pg-13 action movie, its dead, thank you.
","What we have here is an almost contemptuous lack of respect for property and human life. But, when that human life is vile, murderous, plutonium pilfering dirtballs, then its time chop, break, snap, blast, liquify, incinerate and decapitate (repeat).There's very little point in going into a great deal of explanation of what makes this so worth a trip down to your local cinema. Suffice to say Sylvester Stallone has once again saved action movies and put the meat back on the bone. Here he is aided and abetted by messrs Schwarzenegger, Willis, Norris, Van Damme, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Crews, Couture, who all dive into the proceedings with an enthusiastic amount of esprit de corps, taking the carnage to a hitherto undiscovered level. This is an action movie with both feet planted firmly in the 80's and there nothing wrong with that one iota. The guys banter, crack jokes, shoot and cause things to blow up, the bad guys are hissable, murderous wretches to a man and are blown up.Everybody is clearly having a blast, so in translation, so do you, of particular note, Jean Claude Van Damme provides a standout performance as sneery and arrogant Jean Villain.If you like proper action movies i would be bewildered if you didn't enjoy this. Sly, you did it again, you are without a shadow of doubt 'the man'.If they can deliver Eastwood, Ford, Cage, Snipes, Russell, Biehn, Weathers and T for the next one, then my money is already spent.",10,178,284,18 August 2012
Skyfall," My word is my bond and my word, what a good Bond !
","If you only read the first line of my review, heres my opinion, its fantastic, well worth your time and money, see it in IMAX though.I was a little concerned when i first heard Sam Mendes was directing the 50th Bond movie, as a similar unusual choice of director was made with Michael Apted on The World Is Not Enough.That was Pierce Brosnan's third outing as Bond and the Brosnan Bonds, i feel, deteriorated as they went along, even then Bond was still slavishly following the Goldfinger/Thunderball schematic.That rigid, moribund take on Bond culminated in Die Another Day, Bond was starting to look silly, he was becoming a parody, invisible cars were not the way forward.This was the point where it seems to me the producers realised Bond isn't about scale, rather drama and intensity.Since that realisation, they have re-cast, re-tooled and re-booted, the results have been re-markable.Daniel Craig has proved that what may seem like a questionable choice at first, can often be shown to be a wise one in the long term. In our modern times where 'reality' is the watchword, he has, with a little help from the Bond people, brought us an abrasive edge (not seen since Connery) and emotional facet to the character, that will ensure his longevity well into the 21st century.Having loved the Bond movies as a kid, reading the books, its a pleasure to report that Commander (RNR) James Bond is reinvigorated and reporting back for duty, ma'am.Skyfall, without wanting to get too bogged down in tedious semantics, now falls within, i'd say, the three best Bond films to date.After snatching your breath away, with a hell for leather opening chase across Istanbul and a seemingly inescapable cliffhanger, the film settles down into a story where, Bond is emotionally stripped down, questions his very raison d'être and emerges triumphantly to...well i'm not going to spoil it.Javier Bardem provides a Bond villain, with one foot in the past (figuratively) and an eye on a vengeful future, he represents the flamboyance of earlier villains and the elusive spectre of the modern terrorist.Dame Judi Dench is fantastic, she even gets to shoot a gun, what more could you want ?Before the dust settles, we've visited Shanghai, the Bond family home, popped into the National Gallery to view Turner's 'The﻿ fighting Temerarie tugged to her last Berth', fed the Komodo Dragons and quoted some of Tennyson's Ulysses.Bond is experiencing a renaissance and you will be shaken, stirred and thoroughly entertained.",10,5,15,12 November 2012
Gravity," Well Galileo and Isaac theorized about it, but last night I experienced it.
","I really want to convey how thoroughly enjoyable this movie was, but at the same time I don't wish to gush over it. The reason being, that if anyone was reading my review with the thought of watching the film, it is possible to build something up too much and precipitate disappointment.So no hyperbole, just a cool, clear, opinion, delivered with an almost scientific emotional detachment.1. Ask a question, to whit, should I go and watch Gravity, the new science fiction thriller starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney ?2. Conduct research and make observations. Which I did, after reading up on this movie, the consensus seemed to be a favourable one. I had also observed previous efforts by the actors involved and had enjoyed them.3. Propose a hypothesis. The theory being that it would be to my benefit to drag my TV loving backside down to the local purveyor of IMAX entertainment and watch this film.4. Design an experiment to test this hypothesis. Plans were quickly drawn to rendezvous at 19:45 BST at the Odeon, for a screening of the entertainment.5. Test the hypothesis. I watched the movie.6. Collate results and draw conclusions, to support or reject you hypothesis. The results were that I had a fantastic evenings entertainment. Watching a tense, thrilling tale of two astronauts left stranded, by a terrible accident, in orbit, two hundred miles above the Earth. I concluded that the fantastic performances given by the two leads in the piece, combined with assured and innovative direction from Alfonso Cuaron and some dizzying special effects on the IMAX screen, produced a infrequently experienced, yet palpable sensation within me, that for the purposes of this experiment I choose to call, 'thrilled to bits'.I strongly suggest you conduct your own experiment, as I did, in relation to the subject matter. I feel confident you will draw the same conclusions I did.I did notice that some people here on IMDb seemed to have drawn somewhat muddled results from their experimentation in this area. Their conclusions were tainted by perceived scientific and procedural inaccuracies within the film. Having a limited knowledge of these things, I could not hope to debate these issues on any kind of an equal footing. (SPOILER-ISH) That said, I did read a vehement 'technical complaint' in relation to something (completely scientifically impossible) that occurs in a scene which is well established as a dream sequence. I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions from that.",10,1,2,13 November 2013
The Big Lebowski," Very rewarding, if you allow it to be, thats just......y'know, my opinion man.
","The Big Lebowski is a movie which requires repeat viewings, to appreciate the characters situations and the humour which comes from their reactions or lack thereof, to these situations. The Dude is a manipulated man, the Coens have manipulated a man, to whom getting up and going to the toilet is far more a concept, than a reality.They have placed a reluctant, anti-hero in the middle of a plot he is forced to participate in. The characters he encounters within the story manipulate him, all for their own selfish ends and many moralise at him whilst they are pursuing their own nefarious schemes.The Dude abides this treatment, either through inability to challenge it, verbally or physically or in some cases through lack of understanding he is being manipulated. But as he endures the films indignities, he never wavers and in the end returns to his normal pattern of living. Whereas the go getters, the schemers, the users, the pro-active people have all been undone by the own machinations, hoisted by their own petards. The Dude is vindicated in his lifestyle, by default.We are all asked to participate to some degree in our everyday lives in the plotting or social mores of others we feel we have to answer to, the Dude reminds us to step back from time to time and let the cards fall where they may. Control, through opting out, thats why we love the Dude and thats why the Dude, is the Dude !",10,1,2,6 February 2012
Star Trek," Surely the best of times ?
","Well i think we've all pretty much seen it now and i say well done, thats just me talking, i know some people feel the departure in tone is too much, 'the trekkie's canna take it', sorry !I think that its taken a franchise which has been a 3 legged dog since Next Gen finished (excluding some specf DS9 eps) and made it into something which hopefully will carry Star Trek on for new generations (not a pun). The recent series have just run Star Trek into an ever narrower bottle neck of what Trek can or cant be and this has snatched it back from that rut and put it back in the mainstream, where popular culture is supposed to be.A couple of things about it did go CLUNK, primarily Spock and Uhura, but i shook that off, if its going to live on, Star Trek needed a big slap across the chops and this was it. The cast was great, particularly MR Quinto, Spock lives and then some, the script was light and funny and the pace was invigorating.JJ Abrams has fulfilled his obligation, he has brought Trek back like Lazarus, now don't let the standards slip for the next one fellas !",9,1,7,14 May 2009
The Expendables," The Dawn of man !
","I'm afraid i'm throwing my hat in the ring here and probably going to upset some people, but i've got to be honest. This film wasn't just good, it wasn't just amazing, i cant find the appropriate words to say how thrilled and entertained i was by this movie. It honestly made me feel like a teenager again, it brought back every punch, every bullet fired and every exploding vehicle i watched in movies and on TV during the 80s. I just simply cannot understand any person who claims to be an action movie fan not enjoying this. I wouldn't argue on the script or acting front for one second, (although i really found Mickey Rourke's monologue surprisingly touching),but in terms of quality and quantity of action this is inarguably a milestone in action cinema.Hollywood has always made a lot of money from the summer films season and the output has changed dramatically since the 80s. I feel they should acknowledge their audience beyond the teens age group and for all the hundreds of millions Harry Potter, the Pirates and the Vampires generate, some of that profit should be put back into funding middle range budgeted films such as this.I don't feel its an accurate perception that these films cant stir the kind of interest they once did, The Expendables box office would seem to contradict that. Even if you view the combined pulling power of the cast as a gimmick which has garnered interest here, i would ask, what word best describes cgi, since it in itself has become the focal selling point of most, if not all, blockbuster trailers now. I don't want all superheroes, or any genre overly visited and wrung out, we live in an age which prides itself on offering choice to the consumer, from dining out to all forms of other entertainment. Offer old dogs like me more of this type of thing and enjoy my 'expendable' income as well.MR Stallone has come full circle and produced something both nostalgic and contemporary and above all, more fun than i've had in the cinema for a long time, good on ya Sly, now Expendables II please lickety-split !",10,11,20,21 August 2010
Man of Steel," 'It's like, Super........man !'
","I think in many respects this is the movie we would have got if Bryan Singer had been allowed to go 'Wrath of Khan' on his second Superman feature, as he said at the time. But that's the road not taken, so we have Man of steel instead.Clearly Warner brothers wanted more action and that's what Zack Snyder has given them and the results are entertaining and hopeful for the future.The second edict appears to have been not to follow the Superman origin story verbatim, to avoid comparisons with Richard Donner's Superman. Flashbacks are used, mostly successfully, to achieve this. The emotion and understanding that these scenes needed to inject into the movie work very well, (SPOILER-ISH) the ones towards the midway point possibly needed juggling around a bit, but almost immediately Zod reappears at this point, so the whole thing kicks up a gear anyway.There is a lot of action, particularly after the halfway point, mostly its coherent and exciting, occasionally blurry or just too fast. The cast are all excellent, for me Henry Cavill and Michael Shannon stand out.Cavill's Kal-El is unsure of himself, but not overly angst ridden, he comes over as reasonable and good natured, in other words Superman. Shannon's Zod, if its important to you, does touch on Terence Stamp's performance to a small degree, but this has more to do with the fact that there are points where his character shouts as the plot requires it and as Stamp's best (and funniest line) involved shouting, it just draws comparison. The change in origin dynamics negates any worry of audiences getting restless, waiting for the cape to be donned. (WHOPPING SPOILER!).....(NO REALLY!!) I think what I appreciated the most was after Kal has saved the day and appears to have won the trust of the Humans he has been fighting alongside of, conversely Zod has lost everything and without his raison d'etre, he is purposeless. He had one function and never had the luxury to view that function in terms of good or bad.In amongst all the battling, the scene where Zod laments this turn of events to Superman, he chooses revenge directly here and forces Superman to make choice, shortly thereafter, in terms of dealing finally with Zod's choice of actions.At the end of a superhero movie or any movie that ends with destruction, its always nice to find a moral conundrum or denouement like this.So overall Man of steel was a very good, solid starting point for DC/Warner's for future Superman projects and exploring the DC universe, beyond Batman. Now if we can just repair Green Lantern and for a REAL challenge there's an Amazonian warrior who's been cooling her heels for a while now.",8,4,8,16 June 2013
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Right turn Clyde !
","I feel this film really deserves some praise (and probably a better review title than an Any Which Way You Can joke).The film earns its praise in two areas, one, its a very well constructed summer blockbuster, amazing special effects, spectacular action scenes, etc. Two, it really does try to give you something substantial to chew on around the explosions and dust ups.There are clear issues being represented here, the morality of scientific research, the questions of its practice be they altruistic or self-serving. Man's relationship with animals and the tapping of the fear that the original films connected with, the cognisance of the hairy paw of evolution on our shoulder.I wouldn't argue that these are fresh issues or even that the film comes up with any attempts to resolve them, but its just good that the film represents them. Its just enough to make you think, without trying to be too worthy.The cast are all very good, its nice to see actors like John Lithgow and Brian Cox on screen again, even though they have smaller roles. The real standout here is Caeser, played by Andy Serkis, i was really impressed by how much of a full performance he gives as this character, it barely registers that you're watching cgi image, the subtleties that come through in his performance are probably the strongest aspect of the film.Overall i definitely recommend this film, because not only is it a good ride, but it has the benefit of substance as well.",9,2,4,13 August 2011
I Am Legend," Nice to be wrong.
","Finally saw this today and thought it was fantastic, as a remake of the Omega Man. As a rendition of the book, not so much, (but to me it seems they were really going for the Chuck Heston movie more than the book). I slagged it off a lot when i heard who had been cast, but i take it all back now. Will Smith was excellent in the lead and carried off a very difficult role by proving what a good actor he is and not just being Will Smith. I felt it was quite restrained for a big budget movie and built its tension well, without resorting to cheap tricks. It was tense, scary, even moving, its a smaller movie disguised as a blockbuster, but it doesn't disappoint on either front. So i take it all back and highly recommend this one.",9,1,3,28 December 2007
Gran Torino," Legend.
","Thats unquestionably the best word to describe Clint Eastwood. If this is indeed Clint's last hurrah, then its the way to go. Films don't often get to me like this did, but i had something in my eye at numerous points in the proceedings. Seeing Clint taking care of business one last time was just superb and although the ending may be jarring to long time Clint fans, with a bit of thought it all makes sense.Clint's character is an unapologetic racist and thats that, i fully understand that some people just cannot accept this, but the film doesn't apologise for it and neither should it. You either accept this aspect of the character and in doing so accept that he's not supposed to be a hero, so why is he talking like that ?Or realise that in real life people like this exist, who can be good and bad in the same day, but are not solely defined by either behaviour.There is plenty of warmth in this film and humour, but at its centre is an actor and director who has enjoyed critical and commercial success for nearly 40 years, has redefined genres and broken new ground and has brought me more pleasure than i could have ever thought possible.",10,15,25,27 February 2009
The Hurt Locker," Great entertainment.
","I know less than nothing about military protocols and procedures, so i could not possibly comment on the accuracy of those elements in this film. However, as a piece of entertainment i would endorse this film to anyone who likes action /suspense pictures which feature characters who are human beings, as oppose to just cyphers for the on screen kinetics. The story is involving, well paced and insightful. The sense of danger and threat which hangs in the air throughout the film, makes for a very intense viewing experience.All the performances, from the lead actors to the 'recognised' cameos are perfect.I feel this movie proves it is possible for an 'action' film to engage its audience with a good character drama, between things blowing up.",9,0,4,3 September 2009
Avatar," It really is that good.
","Just a quickie, i'm not going to drone on, this was brilliant, BRILLIANT. This is entertainment friends, exciting, action packed, engaging, romantic, funny, its report card is all As, it passed every class. The story alone is timely and relevant, it demands consideration of its issues from even the most passive viewer. Add to that the jaw dislocating effects and top it off with great actors doing their best work and Jimbo's done it again.Is this worth my Pounds, Dollars, whatever ? wholeheartedly YES, even if your not normally a sci-fi kind of soul, its much more than that, see it 3D, see it Imax, just see it, it really is that good.",10,10,17,21 December 2009
Thor," Thunderously good entertainment !
","Straight to the point, this was not only one of the better ones, its one of the few really good ones. I'm sure anyone reading this knows what i'm getting at, they either get these right or they get them wrong. Well this ones right, very right, from start to finish, epic, spectacular, warm, funny, action packed. The story draws you in, the characters are likable, the pace is just right, doesn't race along, but doesn't plod either. Great cast, particularly Chris Hemsworth, if Captain America and Green Lantern can keep up this standard then it'll be a good summer season.Ken's pulled it all together. Go and watch it, i cant imagine you wont enjoy it and if you think i'm being paid to say this then get stuffed !!",9,167,316,25 April 2011
Zombieland," Dead good..........oh yeah, like you didn't consider using that one !
","Perfecting the right mix of 1 part comedy and really any other genre has proved to be difficult over the years. Horror and comedy, as a combination, has been attempted many times, usually the results just underline how difficult it is to achieve.I know i don't need to but we'll rattle off a couple, Shaun Of The Dead, American Werewolf In London and certainly Romero loves him some social satire. Zombieland can well take its place on that list now, the tension and atmosphere of the Zombie sub-genre are intact and the comedy always comes out of the situation and the 'cameo' is beyond funny.As far a 'genre' films go this is easily the best film i've seen this year, with the notable exception of District 9, gory, funny, original and fresh, just watch it.",9,0,1,18 October 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," an excellent finale, to an 'excellent' trilogy
","Taking into account that cynicism is now the new intellectualism, i am staggered at the unfocused, blind hatred being aimed at this film here, and the last two films. Without question i have thoroughly enjoyed these latest STAR WARS movies, the music, the fantastic effects, the feeling of depth and texture that only the STAR WARS movies have. The only problem really has not been the writing ,as such, but the writing about the writing, oh, and the constant moaning about the lack of a Han Solo type character. The dialogue in the previous movies has become iconic, it was never any good ,its just become quotable and iconic, so therefore the collective consideration is that it was good writing ,its not, listen to it again,read all the interviews, with MR Hamill, MS Fisher ,MR Ford and MR Guinness, they all said 'it stunk', the only reason it was more palatable at that time was because we were pretty much all between 5-10 years old. Read what the adults were saying at the time , 'amazing effects' ,'no logic' in the story, 'the syrup of space speak', read David Gerrolds review of Empire,in Starlog magazine, entitled 'EMPIRE STRIKES OUT !', John Brosnan in Starlog ripped it apart 'no proper ending', 'yoda ,the most annoying character ever committed to celluloid'.Now where have we heard that more recently ?. All the main characters, in the prequels, are responsible people in positions of power, the Jedi speak to each other very formally, so dialogue which has not improved since the originals, now has to be delivered even more straight faced and earnestly, notice how George Lucas has attempted to lighten up Obi-Wan in the last two, 'Im going to get a drink', 'You spring the trap' cue big grin.'The acting is stiff and wooden', yes it is in some places, but again your downfall is in comparing it to the originals, the acting there ranges from average to hammy, but why don't we find fault in that, your confusing dialogue read in a colloquial style by the main players, to the formal tones of the new characters, and it has perceivably improved as the films have progressed, Yet apparently he doesn't listen to us mere plebs and surfs, he virtually removed Jar Jar, he gives endless interviews 'I'm sorry about the dialogue', he approached Lawrence Kasden, with a view to working on the prequels, unfortunately MR Kasden declined, he got help on Episode 2, but still we whine. The magic is not there anymore, really ,show both sets of films to a 7 year old , and ask them which is their favourite, bet its not Empire, and most people i know who tow the party line now 'its the best one', liked it the least when we were all ten, i wont name names.The gripe de'jour, 'there's no Han Solo like character', no there's not ,because he appears in episode 4, if he himself, or a similar character had been in the prequels, what would we hear ?, you know damn well, 'he's just lazy', 'creatively bankrupt' etc.We all filled MR Lucas's coffers back in the seventies and eighties, eat it , sleep on it , brush your teeth with it,we loved it,we ran to the marketing machine in droves, but now we view him as the worst sort of capitalist swine, damn his success, that we gave him,oh err, now i begrudge it him as i ring the bell on the street corner,selling the socialist worker.Back on track, there's no magic/myth anymore, example, throw away lines like 'that bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell', that encourage you to come up with your own version of those unseen events, 'Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity', spoken in The Empire Strikes Back and Revenge Of The Sith, respectively. It staggers me that people keep dragging out the same mantra like complaints about each film, it has without doubt been the most painful and turgid aspect of the new films debuts. None of the complaints stand up to any close scrutiny,when applied to the prequels, not one, as these aspects were present years ago,all the good stuffs still there, the marvelous planet vistas, Ben Burtt's sound effects, the eerie biological sounds, the metallic and functional mechanical noises, John Williams rich scoring, these things are all still there, what generation ,post Tarantino ,ever had a chance to like these films, Hollywood has so clouded our view with trying each summer since 77 to replicate George's formula, we cant recognise the real thing when placed in front of us now.I realise that how much money a film makes ,does not make it a good film, but these 6 films never were supposed to be great works of art, they are pure popcorn fun, popcorn fun that got seriously taken on board (myself included), by a whole generation, and if you look at the money each has made, our middle aged ranting has come to nought, they have still found their audience, people still go back again and again, average punters ,who don't read too much into all this the way we like to, they have been entertained, they came back each time, the figures bare this out. I must be lucky that every 3 years i can scrape off all the cynicism, pack mentality, snobbery, prejudice and all round hatefulness that adult life marinades us all in, and just enjoy pure heady childhood spectacle. just like numerous friends of mine who didn't like them, but own them on DVD ?, or constantly ask to borrow mine, scrape the bloody adult off your back and just let yourself enjoy !",10,4,11,22 June 2005
Prometheus," Mesmerising, beautiful, thought provoking, a REAL movie experience.
","That header is just my opinion, its not a guarantee, i feel this is a truly unique film and well worth your time and money. Its a bold movie and has the courage not to rest on previous laurels and opt for the lazy, unoriginal route most blockbusters take. There's no spoilers to give, because the best stuff would take way too much explaining. This film is the realisation of all Ridley's promises to expand on one of the most intriguing indirect questions ever posited, 'who or what was that in the Space Jockey ship'.Its not Alien and its as far from Aliens as you can get, there are connections to Alien, one main connection and others lesser ones. Don't think about the Alien movies, just keep them in the back of your head. It does not dwell on splatter and its not a 'monster' movie, but it does have those things.If you require black and white exposition and don't enjoy post movie speculation, i probably wouldn't recommend it. The films plot is pretty straight forward, ask a question, get your answer but definitely not the one you wanted.What you do get, if you focus on it, are answers and larger questions from those answers, as to 'what was in the chair and what was it doing'. It does not answer everything, either existing questions or new ones that are raised and thats obviously intentional. Because thats whats so damn good about it, it explains more, but doesn't remove all the mystery of the one main thing that connects this to Alien, the mystery that makes the whole thing so provocative.If Ridley had tried to make this a straight on horror/sci-fi movie, it would have been suicidal and a waste of his and our time, Alien cant be topped in that arena.This is a sci-fi film, with 'thriller' elements, thats intended to be the start of something more than just another monster mash and when considering that,it gives you a lot to start with and not just rehashing and cheap tricks. Its the most mature movie in the summer season for a far back as i can remember. This film is a significant effort towards getting adult movies back on the summer season slate, it would be a terrible shame if it couldn't achieve its potential because of individual misinterpretation and pining for elements that we all claim to be thoroughly sick of anyway.",10,24,50,4 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," X Men : First Class, NOT an oxymoron.
","Well after Thor, the pessimist in me was convinced that by the law of averages it had to be downhill for the rest of this summers superhero movies, well i'm really happy to report i was wrong.This was a fantastic shot in the arm to the X Men franchise and a thoroughly entertaining film. Matthew Vaughn very cannily blends a cold war espionage tale into the fabric of a surprisingly emotional origins story. This is no mean trick and the two elements work well together.The characters in the film are not one dimensional expositional figures. The film succeeds most in managing to put the audience inside the characters heads (not a Professor X joke) so their actions and reactions within certain scenes are understood and felt on an emotional level and are not just reduced to incidents that move the plot along.The special effects are top draw and best of all, from the biggest effects to the more unnoticeable ones they all service the audiences experience and understanding of the films story. There is plenty of action in the film, but like the effects, its subservient to the story and not excessive.The cast are fantastic, everyone of them brings something to their role, regardless of how much screen time they have. As i stated earlier, all the actors are largely to thank for drawing the viewer into a state of emotional understanding of their characters. A smart script and deft hand from director Matthew Vaughn provides a confident and competent foundation for this understanding also.Bottom line, i think this well worth your money, no one can guarantee your enjoyment, but even a casual viewer would find it hard to dismiss a film such as this, which has been clearly made with a great deal of thought and care.",9,1,5,5 June 2011
Casino Royale," Superb !
","I'm not going to list every single reason why this film is so damn good, but to start with the exception of saying that Daniel Craig totally exceeded my expectations as Bond, his interpretation of 007 is just groundbreaking.The stunts make your jaw drop, the thrills really do thrill and the poker game is a roller-coaster defeats and victories and one of the best elements is that the relationship between Bond and Vesper is not a superficial plot device but rather a truly engaging affair, which has emotional weight at its outcome.I sincerely hope i will be saying the same thing about the next instalment as i am already looking forward to it. When you consider how many Bond films there have been, its astonishing to me how fresh and revitalised Casino Royale is, Bond is, without a shadow of doubt, back!",10,2,5,19 November 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," McClaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaane !!
","I'm just going to get straight to the point, this was BRILLIANT, a text book example of good old fashioned action movie know how! I was not sure what to expect from a Die Hard in the digital age, i was worried, there was no need to be. CGI is employed in parts of the movie, but sparingly and only when needed, it does seem to have been trimmed here and there for language, i imagine subsequent DVD releases will address that.The bad guys are bad, but not 'over the top', the stunts are the kind that make you suck in air through your teeth, but best of all it doesn't try to compete with the previous entries in the Die Hard franchise. It just does its own thing and by that default becomes a great addition to the series. Bruce IS McClane, he just inhabits the role of John now, shoot him, kick him out of the window, blow him up or even throw a car at him, he'll just bounce back. I really gravitate to this idea of his strong beliefs in simple human values and attitudes, is what keeps him centered in the face of this onslaught of technology.If your looking for a 'ride' movie, look no further, John McClane is about to have a very bad day, but you'll have a great night !",7,4,7,7 July 2007
Looper," Very clever, very original and very welcome.
","I would have thought it doubtful that anyone could have anything new to add to the sci-fi sub category of time travel movies. After watching Looper yesterday, i'm happy to report that Rian Johnson has removed those doubts and given me hope that sci-fi in Hollywood can be more than just empty spectacle.First off i would say, don't get discouraged from watching the film if you think its going to be too complex or difficult to follow. To follow the story and recognise characters motivations does require a little concentration, but not to the point that you wont enjoy the action beats and other more visceral elements.The story is well constructed, information and plot points are presented at an entertaining and well judged pace. There are some nice little throw away visual references and metaphors which, if you catch them, add a nice texture to the story and stop it feeling too clinical in its plotting.The script is tight, hard edged and very dry in its humour, the actors are fantastic. I think its fair to say that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is well on his way to being 'one to watch', Bruce Willis pops back to life here, clearly enjoying himself again, (although i wouldn't say this is solely a Bruce Willis movie in that definition).This is a brilliant movie experience, its an wholly original and entertaining idea, that the writer/director has managed to successfully transpose to film without, it would appear to a layman, pressure or interference from external sources.No matter how much of a good time you will have watching this film (and you will), Hollywood could stand to learn much more from it.",10,523,857,29 September 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," 30 years down road !
","I'm not going to ramble on about how good Star Wars is, it has reached a point now where mere words just cant do it justice. I just love it, it is like a drug, a few seconds with it and i'm somewhere else, it just makes your mind take flight, so on that level it is like a kind of intoxication. It forces you to imagine and wonder, like any well told story, it demands audience participation on some level. This kid in 1977 didn't stand a chance, after 2 hrs i was in for life, even though my Dad called it 'daft'. I love all of it, the films, YES all the films. Just cannot understand the whining about the prequels, all i could think of when watching them was 'Yaaaay we're back in the Star Wars universe'. The merchandise, all of it, to me it all boils down to 3 letters F U N.Its a shared experience, i saw the re-release in Manchester in 97 with my friends and about 300+ students, when the logo came up the screaming and shouting was deafening. When you consider that most of those students would have been just born or not even with us yet, on the films original run, it just shows how truly unique its lasting effect is.So heres to 30 years of Star Wars, thanks for all the F U N and heres to another 30. ( get cracking with those TV shows George !) Sorry i did ramble a bit, but hey ,how often does the 30th anniversary roll around, as Woody from Cheers would say 'dont ask me, i'm not a fan!'",10,0,0,29 April 2007

","The studio have obviously looked at Spiderman, Hulk, X-men and Daredevil, and despite the varying degrees of popularity there, I think it was wise of them to make this a much lighter jaunt.This film is pure undemanding entertainment, it has nothing more on its mind than 'lets have some fun', and dark superhero movies are getting to be a bit of a pill. I can appreciate how a big fan of the comic, would take issue with the changes that have been made, bottom line folks, your a film studio, your spending $100 million dollars making a piece of 'entertainment', it has to play to 10 yr olds, it has to play to 30 year olds, or even 60 year olds, so what do you do? Well you can ensure your film has got some jokes, some action, some romance, some eye popping special effects, and mix in the main staples of the comic book, hey presto ! Or you can slavishly stick to every plot twist , every nuance, and every back story ever printed in the comics to please the percentage of your audience who are hard core fans of the comics. I love films ,all films, all types, but this is a business, look at Batman Begins, what a great film, but its taken it 1 month to make over $180 million in the U.S, thats not amazing business, this doesn't mean its a bad film, I thought it was amazing, but obviously a large portion of the films potential audience have shied away from it, why?, well I didn't feel it was suitable for a kid under 12 and cant imagine a large number of the fairer sex found much to their taste in there. The studios just wont pump mega bucks into something which only appeals to a limited number of punters. 'Jaws' the book ,changes substantially, as 'jaws' the film,there's a lot missing, didn't effect it much,in fact if you have read the book and seen the film, I think most would agree the changes were right for the film. I do hate changes to source material, one film in the pipeline (for a long time now) is 'The A Team', words cannot express the love i have for that show, but the movie will be barely recognisable, and you've just got to swallow it. I think what you can really say is, if your adapting a book, comic, TV show, whatever, its not how close you stick to the source material that will win you the biggest audience, but how well you identify what type of film the material dictates it to be, and then make the best film you can of the type you decided on , then cross your fingers !",8,95,184,22 July 2005
