Blade Runner 2049," very long boring plotless mumbled film
","I was looking forward to this sequel as i had liked first blade runner film,, so i excused the slow start and mumbled speech, but it never improved, got worse,i had no idea what was going on, or why things happened, it felt like an art house film from the 1970's, how it gets high marks ill never know, its got none of the excitement felt in the first film, much too much CGI, which is obvious. 
i wouldn't recommend this borefest to anybody",2,9,17,19 February 2018
Lone Survivor," action packed afghan war yarn
","i watched this film alone,and enjoyed it, it starts a bit slow, with the usual watching soldiers mucking about on the camp, this i found boring, and i was glad i hadn't paid to watch it in the cinema, eventually the action starts, that's my only real qualm about the film. also i didn't understand what their mission was, but also didn't care, as the action is great, lots of shooting, getting shot, breaking bones, nasty injuries, the combat sequence was exciting, as always there are bits that don't see true, like surely the navy seals would speak some afghan? at least enough to greet people, or tell them to put their hands up etc..as shouting in English cant be very helpful. the stunts are amazing and look very painful, and id say almost no CGI was used,. if you like war films, action then you'll like this",7,0,1,28 December 2015
Fury," good gritty war film
","if you want total reality in a war film, watch world at war, but if you want a romp, some action a bit of drama, this film is for you, I saw all the bad reviews on IMDb, after i had thoroughly enjoyed the film. I thought it was pretty authentic, very bad things happen in war, men are driven quite mad. I liked the whole thing how they had authentic uniforms, tanks, guns, It was suitably claustrophobic in the tank, realistic in that they were filthy, as there are no showers or pizza huts in the middle of war,and the second world war at the near end was vicious on all sides,prisoners were often summarily executed, some of the scenes in the war, really make me glad i wasn't there.i would recommend this film to anybody who likes old fashioned war films, where you just enjoy the ride.",10,4,11,13 February 2016
Train to Busan," frantic. fast moving zombie film, with twists and style
","i loved this film, fast moving zombies, lots of biting, scary, had me shouting at the screen, ''run run run'', The train situation was great, as they are trapped, claustrophobic, and yet escape is possible,. All the actors did great job,some with comic aplomb. The little girl is an amazing actress. do admit in some places it slowed down, when you would think it would keep racing, with sentimental and melodramatic moments, i guessed these were Korean film culture.but they still added to the anxiety. This film takes zombie films forward,. further then zombie land did, it makes walking dead look amateur. i would recommend this film to anybody except maiden aunts and sissies",10,2,5,7 May 2017
Green Room," punk rockers fight skinheads in this blood bath
","I read lots of bad reviews about this film, before i saw it, so didn't have high hopes, but i really enjoyed it. I was wanting to know how they were going to escape, and enjoyed the action some of the gore was too much and i had to look away, basic premise ,punks fight skinheads in building. in order to escape them.lots of gore, fights ,shooting, just what you want,some punk songs. if your expecting the expendables budget you will be dissappointed, but if you like a horror/action film, you'll enjoy it",8,2,3,4 July 2018
Dunkirk," A Mish-mash of a film, disappointing
","This film was filmed amazingly, but that's where my praise end. SPOILER ALERT> From the first scene it showed no character depth whatsoever, we had no idea who they were, nothing, they all get killed,by running down an open street, one gets away, our so called main character,he forgets his comrades instantly and moves on, the whole film is like this. None of the soldiers smoked, not one, nobody swore, no banter nothing, they were like robots. The highlights, the spitfire pilots the small boat crew, they saved the film for me.On that day 300,000 troops were on the beach, where were they, a few hundred didn't give the right atmosphere, they could have used CGI i wouldn't have minded,it didn't feel epic, and it is an epic story many of the other review on here, seem to either be written by people involved in the making of the film or just people writing about the actual Dunkirk story. but this website is for film reviews, not history reviews.If you didn't know the story, and went to see this film, you would be non the wiser at the end. So now there will be thousands of teenagers with a very strange view of Dunkirk and the British military.I'd like to know where were the sergeants barking orders, corporals where were they, no just sullen silent privates, It was filmed very well, especially the spitfire dog fights , and tom hardy was great as usual, as were the other pilots, If you want to see a good film about Dunkirk ,watch the 1950's film,",4,5,12,30 July 2017
Die Hard 2," utter pony
","just watched die-hard what a load of pony, god stunts, acting not bad, some comedy, plot ridiculous, handled ridiculously. SPOILER ALERT 1, they would have diverted all the planes to other airports 2. the airport police would have taken a shoot out very seriously. 3.the so called special forces would have had berets in exactly the same style, 4, the baddies would have hired the church, not squatted in it ( anything could have gone wrong). 5, the airport could have used generators on wheel to power up the lights, 6.where did the baddies think they would fly to, where, ? 7. there would have been hundreds of fbi. army soldiers there, not 20. 8.why didn they just make it a hijack,now that would have been suspenseful, but no they make this hash, i watched it all the way to the end, thinking it might improve, but no, earlier in the film, bruce willis phones his wife on a plane via a pay phone!!!, but when radio contact is lost with plane, it never occurs to anybody to phone them.!!! i hate long reviews on IMDb of more than one paragraph, but i cant stop i hated this film the fist time i saw it in 80's and i hate it even more now. i know its an action film, but really, there was no need for the crap plot, it was just lazy, one star is me being generaous",1,6,12,16 April 2016
Yesterday," very good fun film about love and music
","I loved this film,i was toldit wasnt so good by mates,but they are wrong its great, id happily watch it again many times, its full of music, funny stories, the fact that nobody knows who the beatles are ,is good for alot of laughs, and the almost love story, had me in tears many times.
its also quite unique,in i havent seen a film with this idea before, so i was intrigued as to what would happen and wasnt able to guess befor eit happend,so lots of surprises.
what more can i say, if you like fun and love and music, then this is th eiflm for you.",10,1,2,9 February 2020
Gone Girl," a mystery/thriller
","i saw many bad reviews of this film, but i saw it on DVD, so wasn't expensive, i quite liked it, i bet it made a good book, it has plot holes, but what films don't, and the police may seem lazy in this, but isn't that normal, they aren't all CSI junkie. It has a lot of twists, which is what i like, and you're never sure whats going to happen, the end wasn't great, but maybe realistic. SPOILER ALERT: i think at the very end they should have shown the lowlifes on television, saying they had seen her in the motel.they were really the only loose ends, she hadn't fixed, as that bit could easily be wound up , but still worth seeing,if you catch it on television one afternoon",6,1,3,1 January 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," a badly made mess of a film
","i looked forward to seeing this film, so i was excited, today i watched it, it started badly, i couldn't understand what the characters were mumbling, later on i found this a god send. It awful a real mess , badly made, most of the time i had no idea what was going on, too many characters introduced so quickly, six different locations in ten minutes. i hate it,ill never watch it again, i only watched it to see if would improve, but no, it got worse.if the comic was like this, well its no wonder i have never heard of them before.the tiny bits of humor are the only things that made em pay attention to anything,i wouldn't recommend this to anybody",1,7,17,31 December 2014
Super 8," a really good fun film
","i hadn't heard of this film and saw it on cable, from the off i liked it,films with kids in them as the main character always get my attention when i was young and still do. i read some bad reviews of this film, so was a little wary, but i son realized they must be trolls,as this film keeps you watching,even before anything really happens, the kids are great actors. This film isn't realistic as it involves aliens etc..once you understand that then you can enjoy it,its very Steven Spielberg, which i like,lots of effects a unusual story, monsters, laughs, a bit of sorrow. as its based in 1979 they use music from them, and jokes about stuff like Walkmans etc..all in all i liked it, it has a few swear words in it, so maybe not for little ones. i liked it and luckily i taped it so i can watch it again tomorrow.",9,1,4,6 August 2016
Spectre," dull , long, no direction ,mess
","i love james bond,I've seen all the films, and i can say this is the worst one, dull , meandering script, at times i had no idea what the plot was. lots of confusiion ,SPOILER ALERT: like aeroplanes appearing from no where,daniel craig didn't appear to act at all, just the same bemused face all the way through, im surprised he doesn't want to do any more.there are good stunts, car chases, fights, but lots of boredem, and often i was lost, the side story of oo dept being scrapped was just annoying, often extra would disappear completely, i wouldn't recommend this film to anybody. if james bond ahdnt been in it, id thinkit was a b movie made for TV",1,19,36,28 February 2016
