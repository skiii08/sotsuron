Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Masterpiece!!
","George Lucas has done it again.  22 years after directing Star Wars Episode IV in 1977, George Lucas has, again, directed one of the best movies of the year.  The movie is filled with stunning visual effects; unlike anything I've ever seen.  Star Wars Episode I is a great movie to watch and is also aimed at audiences in almost all of the age groups.  Little children, especially, will enjoy it.  My favorite parts of the movie are the Pod Race and the fighting sequences.  The main characters in the movie are Anakin Skywalker, Qui-Gonn Juinn, and a young Obi-Wan Kenobi.  They meet lots of characters along the way. The setting takes place approximately 32 years before Episode IV and it focuses on the life of Luke and Leia's father, Anakin Skywalker.  Overall, a great movie to watch.  An easy '12' on a 1 to 10 scale!",10,0,0,19 July 1999
Army of Darkness," A movie with good one-liners
","The Army of Darkness, the 3rd installment of the Evil Dead series is, to me, more of a comedy than a horror film.  Bruce Campbell returns to the role as Ash.  There are plenty of good one-liners in the movie that had me rolling on the floor.  Overall, a fun movie to watch.",10,1,1,24 April 1999
Mr. Holland's Opus," For People Who Love Music
","Mr. Holland's Opus is very entertaining movie to watch.  This movie is perfect for people who enjoy music and love to perform it.  Richard Dreyfus is perfect in the lead role as Mr. Glenn Holland (he was nominated Best Actor), a music composer who captures the hearts of all his students in a 30 year span.  Though Lengthy, a wonderful movie to watch for the whole family!!!",10,2,3,8 September 1999
A Nightmare on Elm Street," On the edge of your seat thriller
","Freddy is scary and terrifying in this first installment of the series. With green bile for blood, Freddy gives you chills up and down your spine. Definitely a great movie for horror fans. Might have of the bloodiest scenes EVER in a horror film.  Along the lines of movies like 'Halloween', and 'Friday the 13th.'",10,2,3,9 October 1998
