The Ring," Excellent
","I thought this movie was great. I am not much for horror movies but this one was MUCH different than the usual run of the mill Freddy-Jason slasher movies. BEWARE Spoilers below: Someone made a comment about the blurred photos and the horse having nothing to do with the plot. I disagree. The scenes with the horse were very important to the plot. The horse sensed the evil death 'spell' that was cast upon Rachel after watching the video. I am not a horse expert but for whatever reason the horses sensed the evil. Remember that Samara cursed her mother the same way. Anna's(the mother) horses started going crazy and were dying/killing themselves. Remember that Anna eventually killed herself as well. It was reported a suicide in the newspaper articles Rachel found, but we now know she probably died the same way both Katie and Noah did. The blurred pictures happened only to those who were 'cursed' from watching the video. It doesn't have any HIGHER meaning other than to show that it was one of the symptoms of watching the video. It was creepy nonetheless.  The twisted faces of those that died were absolutely FREAKY. I love this movie and watching it a second time gave me more insight to what was really going on. I plan to buy the dvd and can't wait to see it again! Ciao",10,0,0,20 December 2002
