Hereditary," Unsettling, gripping, terrifying but ridiculous end
","This is by far one of the most terrifying films recently made. Its a slow burner and as the move progresses it gets more and more terrifying. The director creates tension and suspense at different levels and it escalates into a ridiculous end. Everything was executed flawlessy to create an unsettling atmosphere and unlike usual horror movie this one doesn't rely on any jumpscares to scare or shock the viewer. Full points for that as it takes a brilliant director to create that. The background sound was weird but it help bring the tension in.The main lead, Annie plays her part exceptionally well and you can see she is a great actress to pull of a role that is demanding. Her expressions itself speaks volumes creating that uneasy, uncomfortable portayal. The girl had a very creepy character and you can spot the sinister and mystery in her. You can feel the family's tension throughout the movie which potrays a very disturbing and disfuncional one.I would have rated the movie higher if it wasnt for the nonsensical ending which I felt disjointed grom such a tense, gripping, unnerving and terrifying film.",7,0,1,7 September 2018
Deadpool 2," Not as good as the first but still a entertainer
","I prefer the first deadpool movie as it has the shock factor and the uniqueness of a superhero movie, it basically stands out due to its style and humour.This movie falls short on humour that is appealing. Some were funny and some forced. Through the first half it was a bit boring in parts but then picks up for the second half. It still an entertaining film and keeps true to its style and violence. Ryan Reynolds is undoubtedly funny and he is what keeps the deadpool movie alive and kicking.Special effects and actions scenes were great and the villain is laughable, I guess it suits this kind of a humourous film.",6,1,2,7 September 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Here, there and everywhere
","Not a major fan of Avengers, but this is the best of the lot but there are many flaws with Infinity War, one of them is the Thanos powers are not clearly consistant. The battles happen in a here there and everywhere fashion. It sometimes feel like different movies all put together and sometimes hard to follow whos doing what and for what purpose.The battles scenes are great with exceptionally visuals and cgi but the purpose to defeat one undefeated villian is jumbled up. Infinity Wars is clearly an overated movie but deserves credit especially in the visuals and a simple plot which the movie intends to make it complex.I didnt feel the superheroes powers like we did in their stand alone movies, its like a buffet.The worst performance was The Hulk, he had absolutely no business in being there if he was not willing each time to show his powers. I expected more from Infinity Wars since the big hype and thought they could have done more fighting as united Avengers to defeat one main villain. I know this might be done deliberately so that we can spend another 2,5 hours again for the next installment.Nevertheless its still an entertaining movie that I liked but not love or drool over it like some fans, has its ups and down with top of the range visual effects. Some say that it is so sad in the end, honestly I did not feel anything for them at the end, the ending is just bad, and it might turn out diffently in the next installment.Between Black Panther and Infinity War, I would prefer Black Panther as it was more focused on the characters and story which is a better made film overall.To have a rating of 8.6 on imdb is undeserving as these are mostly fanboys superior ratings. To give where credit is due is only in the visuals and cgi and maybe in the difficulty in making such a huge movie with a huge cast that is why I give a 7 out of 10M",7,1,1,17 August 2018
A Quiet Place," Terrifying but could be more
","Set in an apocalyptic world where silence will keep you alive from monsters that have ultra sensitive hearing ability, a family tries their best to stay alive in these circumstances.
The movie does have some terrifying scenes, you would put yourself in their shoes and what would you have done if you experienced the same.There are some questionable choices that family makes but if you ignore the logic you would enjoy the movie for its horror and terrifying set.One disappointment is that there are no further explanation as to why or how the creatures came to being, it is just there.Otherwise a solid movie that is sucessful in delivering horror.",7,1,1,29 July 2018
