Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," ' Borat ' : Nobody at the theatre I went to was laughing very hard.
","The most I could say was that the movie caused a smile now & then but I wasn't laughing out loud. So, upon leaving the theatre, I purposely stood at the exit and watched the crowd leave to view THEIR reaction. Nobody was smiling and nobody was laughing.The humor is along the lines of the minor comedian, Tom Greene. If you know him and his method of making people uncomfortable while keeping the straight face, then you have an idea of what 'Borat' is about but non-stop. In fact, the movie essentially ridiculed the poverty and lack of amenities of the European people that the character was supposedly part of so much that they are now litigating against the film producers.Yes, folks, the film producers laughed and mocked poor people.I wouldn't recommend this movie nor even renting it.",1,8,17,3 December 2006
