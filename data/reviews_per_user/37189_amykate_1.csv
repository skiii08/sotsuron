The Blair Witch Project," You won't be able to sleep!!
","In a day and age when there is NO such thing as a 'horror movie', this film SCARES YOU!!! It is not what you see, but rather what you do NOT see that wigs you out. The final scene was enough to make me shudder. Super chilling and creepy. For a full 45 seconds or a minute after the film ended, no one in the theater moved or said a word. I was unable to stand up and my arms were shaking. If you are looking for a REALLY disturbing and scary movie that is intelligent, this is a MUST SEE!!!!",10,1,2,18 July 1999
