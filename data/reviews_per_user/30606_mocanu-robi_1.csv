Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," One of the best comedy's ever!
","The film is great!One of the best comedy's I've ever seen.The only thing I don't understand is why didn't the producers say that the spoken language of Borat's home town is Romanian and that the film was shot in Romania?And if they have lied about it than why didn't IMDb people make a note about this fact in the ''goofs'' section?However I strongly recommend this film to anyone who has the slightest idea about est European country's such as Romania,my respect for IMDb's integrity has dropped when I saw that they left out on purpose important things about this movies cast,film location and spoken language. To conclude I would like to add the things that have been left out: 1.The spoken language of the people in Borat's village is Romanian and not Polish or what what ever they've invented.. 2.The people that are in the movie as Borat's family are Romanian gypsy's who have been bought to play in this movie by giving them food(taking advantage of their poverty). 3.Location of the village is of course in Romania. Things that are not mentioned,and I believe that these things have a pretty big importance.At least if they don't mention it they shouldn't lie about it. I think IMDb people should apologize about this ''mistake'' and correct it!",Null,1,5,12 January 2007
