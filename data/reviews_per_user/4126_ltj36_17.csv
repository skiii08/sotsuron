The Blair Witch Project," The Bleah Witch Project
","I have been very disappointed by this movie. I have seen for weeks the (this one really terrifying) trailer and when it's arrived the day of the movie vision, I said 'That's all here?'. No fear, no suspense, only some disgusting movements with the camera. And the end is not the best. i think, that if it was shot like a normal horror it could be better. The right soundtrack (see Danny Elfman or Mark Snow), the right director of photography (see Emmanuel Lubezki or Paul Sarossy) could have done an impressive work. And then, nothing happens! But is real different from the 'Nothing happens!' of a real masterpiece of horror: 'Picnic at Hanging Rock'.",5,0,2,22 February 2000
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," 'The Little Prince' from Outer Space
","I have a question for you: do you think that can live someone in the world who hates 'E. T.'? Not me, surely. With this movies Steven Spielberg made not the one and not the last of a long serial of masterpieces but this is like the Everest in the Himalaya. It's a tender fable of a friendship between two 'innocents': Elliott is a boy who still doesn't know how the real world is and E. T. is an extraterrestrial (did you noticed a strange games in their names. E. T. and E lliot T?) I made a comparison between E. T. and 'The Little Prince' because they are similar: two undefended creatures in a world not always good.",10,1,2,3 March 2000
Fight Club," Methods of Mayhem
","'Fight Club' is a movie born to let people discuss. It can be considered a masterpiece of the modern times (as I did) or a stupid and excessive movie. The story is told us by an anonymous Narrator (symbol of the every man), which is disappointed by his life and find comfort visiting people affected by cancer. Then he meets two dropouts like him: the strange Marla Singer (Helena Bonham carter, dressed like a scarecrow) and the fascinating Tyler Durden, which involves him in an hurricane of violence and anarchy. And the Narrator doesn't know how to stop him and himself. The story begins with a fantastic introduction in the false - golden life of the narrator, affected by insomnia and depression and it is like a shout for freedom in a society trapped by herself in the logic of 'making money'. Tyler founds an organization called Mayhem to destroy all the false symbols of a life untrue and makes little acts of terrorism, introducing frames of porn movies in movies for children. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton gives two astonishing performances: the first is fantastic in denying his image of sex-symbol for an acting voted to destruction, the second, the normal man willing to revolt to society, is one of the best actors of 2000.",10,3,8,19 November 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Burton strikes back!
","I think that 'Sleepy Hollow' is one of the best movies of the year. THIS is a scary movie not 'The Blair Witch Project'. There's a strange atmosphere in this movie, I think it's a perfect 'Halloween Movie' with mystery, death, fear and a splendid art direction. The tribute of Burton to Hammer is perfect, because it respects the rules of the good horror movie 'Not blood but fear. Not screams but subtle terror'. It is perfect with a great Johnny Depp and an evil(fantastic her final monologue)Miranda Richardson (she deserved and Oscar nomination). Great cameo by Martin Landau. I hope that the 3 nominations will become 3 Oscars. You know, I think that Jack O' Lantern isn't a legend. It works in Hollywood and his name is Tim Burton. I'm right, do you agree?",10,0,0,6 March 2000
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," It could be the end of the world as we know it
","We don't know how many times in that period the world risked to live a story like the one of 'Dr. Strangelove'. A fool general orders to his airplanes to go to launch the Atom Bomb on Russia and while an English captain tries to change his mind, all the military chiefs of USA are reunited to try to solve the problem with the Russian Ambassador and a strange and pro Nazi scientist called Dr. Strangelove. Kubrick puts on a tragic satire on the Cold War, showing us the anti communism and the foolish paranoid of the militaries, especially Buck Turgidson (played by a restless George C. Scott) and Jack D. Ripper (which sounds as Jack The Ripper, the famous English serial killer), which Sterling Hayden plays with great intensity. In his face is impressed all the hate and the rage of a stupid man, who became paranoid. Then, there is the wonderful performance by Peter Sellers, which plays the reasonable Captain Mandrake, the stupid and impotent President Muffey and the terrific Doctor Strangelove, a man on a wheelchair with a hand rebel to the rest of the body and who, at the end of the movie, jumps on with the right hand up revealing his Nazist origin. This movie is very funny and cruel, a reflection against war and human madness, which can only guide world to the ruin and the destruction.",10,1,1,29 October 2000
Forrest Gump," Running into success
","'Forrest Gump' has been a great success in 1994. Beyond the various accuses of being only a tearjeker of success, we have to say that this movie has a lot of good things: the story of the stupid famous has a lot of funny moments (the meeting with Johnson or the saving of Dan in Vietnam), but we don't have to forget that death is always present in the movie: on Tv we see only violence and a lot of characters around Forrest die. 'Forrest Gump' is a fable of this century, a very beautiful and moving fable. The actors are great: Tom Hanks gives a very tender performance, made by innocence and surprise, Robin Wright is the lost angel full of sadness, Gary Sinise shows us all the rage and self-destruction of his character and Sally Field is the Mum we all wish to have. Great work behind the scenes with the beautiful score by Alan Silvestri and the great photography of Don Burgess. Special effects are exceptional. Look for the young son of Forrest. he's the new star Haley Joel Osment!",10,1,4,24 November 2000
American Beauty," Ode to humanity
","Weakness. This is a movie about human weakness, that thing that give us our humanity. Carolyn, Mister Fitts and Angela are those who don't want to admit their weakness. Carolyn needs to have an inner double, who can be angry with her, as she feels weak. The kiss given by Mr Fitts to Lester is a clue of the weakness of a man, who loved nazis theories for their strength and hated homosexuals, the weakest people in the world. Angela invents a lot of sexy stories to erase that virginity never lost. Lester was a 'false strong', but he tried to be real (and weak) and to let discover to the others their humanity, made of weakness too. But no one wants to be considered weak and this is the cause of his death. I think that this movie is like a cane, which remains on the heart and makes us reflect about what we are.",10,0,0,11 February 2000
The Patriot," The revenge of Braveheart
","This time Mel Gibson takes his revenge against England. In 'Braveheart' he was tragically killed by the cruel English, he fought for independence. This time, even if he pays a lot for his freedom, arrives at the end of the movie standing triumphantly against the defeated enemy. Surely, 'The Patriot' presents some moments quite unbelievable, when Gibson kills the English troop with the help of his 10 years old boys (two children shoot better than professional soldiers?), but it is a good movie. Emmerich knows how to catch the attention of the spectator with fantastic fights, well orchestrated and very impressive. The actors are good, especially the newcomer Ledger, the evil Isaacs and the great Wilkinson. Great photography by Caleb Deschanel (he deserves an Oscar for his work).",7,0,1,3 September 2000
Edward Scissorhands," The story of a pure heart
","'Edward Scissorhands' is a fable of our times. The story of the robot with a human heart, who finishes in the boring world of American Suburbia and who understands that there's no place for him in that city of falseness, is fantastic. Johnny Depp gives a wonderful and tender performance, Winona Ryder is good too (but that hair color is terrific!) and the cameo of Vincent Price is one of the best roles, he ever did. I think, that the lunar Burton and the pure Edward are very similar: two poetic souls in a too much concrete world. Great score by Danny Elfman. 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,8 May 2000
The Exorcist," After 30 years the fear is always big
","I've seen 'The Exorcist' for the first time for this new release and I've been quite frightened. But I have to say that after 30 years this isn't anymore the most terrific movie on earth. I don't want to say that I've been bored because it's still a fantastic opera. The scenes with the devil are very effective and the performances of the actors (especially by the tormented Jason Miller and the newcomer and astonishing good Linda Blair) are very very good. The scenes I liked much more are the beginning in Iraq with Max Von Sydow, who begins to fear that there's something strange, the arrival of the already possessed Regan at the party in her house and the final fight against evil with the sudden and brave decision of Father Karras. William Friedkin does a very good job in directing with a lot of subliminal frames of the devil and also compliments to Rick Baker for the make up, Mike Oldfield for the famous music and Owen Roizman for the livid photography.",8,1,4,8 December 2000
The Usual Suspects," Thanks
","Dear friends of Internet Movie Database, finally I've found the time to write something about my movie. That's fantastic, a perfect portrayal of my life! Kevin Spacey worked very good in my part (and I contributed  with my ehm... influence, to give him the Oscar) and Chazz Palminteri made that detective Kujan much more intelligent than the real. The other actors, especially Gabriel Byrne, are perfect1 What? Did you believed that Chris McQuarrie, the screenwriter, had invented everything? That me, Keyser Soze, I'm only an invented character? Ah, ah! That's funny! Sure, a criminal like me, the more stays hidden, the more he lives, but I'm narcissist and so, I decided to show all my appreciation for this perfect and thrilling movie.                      Yours, Keyser Soze.",10,0,1,29 February 2000
The Elephant Man," A human being
","It's incredible to see that the same author of the visions of 'Blue Velvet' and 'Wild at Heart' is the same of two poetics operas like 'The Straight Story' or 'The Elephant Man'. Me, I prefer this kind of David Lynch, a man who shows us the hypocrite  and cruel society: if John Merrick (a wonderful John Hurt) is an external ugly, the Victorian society is much more ugly in his cruelty against him. His shout: 'I'm not an animal! I'm a human being!' it's still deeply and sadly actual. Great performances by Anthony Hopkins (it is fantastic, but this performance is not valued), Anne Bancroft and the 2 old glories John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller. Fantastic and moving!",9,1,1,15 May 2000
Titanic," Fantastic, poetic, titanic.
","This movie is a movie with the capital M. Like 'Gone With The Wind' places the love of two normal characters into the Story, involving us in one of the great disasters of all time. If the story (beautiful-rich-next-to-marry-rich-b****rd-girl meets young-handsome-pure-and-intelligent-guy)is already known, Cameron shows us how cinema can reconstruct the real world. Years of study on the original projects of the ship, a perfect research from the structure of the ship until the resemblance of the actors with the real persons (Bernard Hill and Victor Garber are the clearest examples), all is made by Cameron to take us on the 'Titanic': we taste the beauty of the ship, the elegance of the rich people and the dreams of the poor ones. And then, we sink with the ship and its inhabitants. A perfect movie with a perfect cast and a perfect crew (never forget the James Horner's wonderful score or the fantastic art direction by Peter Lamont). Perfect, nothing else to say.",10,2,3,3 November 2000
It's a Wonderful Life," A Movie To Love
","It's impossible to hate 'It's A Wonderful Life'. Even if you hate all the sweet in the cartoon movies, you  can't be of stone in the great end of this movie: it is one of the biggest and sincere moments of happiness in all the story of cinema. It's the zenith of the philosophy of a master of happy life, who was Frank Capra: a story of a good man, George Bailey, who decides to commit suicide, when the family's factory is going to bankrupt. An angel without wings, Clarence, will save him and he will show him the world without the presence of George Bailey, a world of corruption completely in the hands of his enemy Mr. Potter. George Bailey is interpreted by the man with the right face for this role, James Stewart and his wife by the sweet Donna Reed. Lionel Barrymore portrays Potter, a sort of Scrooge without possibility of redemption and Henry Travers is the old, sweet and naive Clarence, desperately seeking wings. Then we mustn't forget the contribute of a great task force of actors like Thomas Mitchell, Beulah Bondi, Sheldon Leonard, H. B. Warner and the up-coming Gloria Grahame. Really the perfect story for Christmas, pure and sweet. Merry Christmas Frank and James wherever you are.",10,1,3,20 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Force is still the Force
","'Star Wars' is really a Movie. It's impossible to hate this story of adventure and myth in a galaxy far far away... George Lucas sends us in a world of strange aliens, funny robots and Jedi knights since the beginning helped by the famous and beautiful theme by John Williams. The story of Luke Skywalker, son of the fallen Jedi Anakin, which has to rescue Princess Leia Organa (chief of the rebels) from the evil Empire of Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader is famous around the world. The special effects are fantastic (thanks to John Dykstra, John Stears and all the others...) and the cast is wonderful. The good idea has been the one to choose the cast. the three principal roles are assigned to three unknown actors (in 1977 Harrison Ford wasn't still Harrison Ford) and to place two great stars of English cinema as supporting actors: Peter Cushing is exceptional as the evil Tarkin (he played the movie with slippers at his feet, because the boots were little) and Alec Guinness gives to Obi Wan Kenobi a mythic air. Dennis Lawson (Wedge Antilles) is the uncle of Ewan McGregor. this is a movie which will remain forever.",10,0,0,31 December 2000
The Thin Red Line," Between Paradise and Hell
","With only 3 movies Terrence Malick is rightly considered as a genius of cinema. 'The Thin Red Line' is very different from any other war movie: Guadalcanal is only a symbol of the tragedy of war, told us by the beautiful musings of private Witt (why the screenplay hasn't been 'academy awarded'?), the soul of the movie. It is a movie when paradise and hell collide: the beautiful forests and the battles, death & horror and peace & love (in the memories of Bell). Everything is perfect in this movie: the fascinating photography by John Toll, the great cast especially Sean Penn, Nick Nolte (wonderful his musings, when he speaks with John Travolta), Ben Chaplin and Jim Caviezel. Only one thing: let's hope that Terrence doesn't wait other twenty years for another masterpiece!",10,1,2,28 February 2000
Gladiator," Maximus Movie
","We thought that the star of director Ridley Scott was going to disappear thanks to unsuccessful movies like the good  'Albatross' or the really weird 'G. I. Jane', but fortunately he is came back with a success like 'Gladiator' and a promising title like 'Hannibal'. Even if doesn't absolutely respect history, this movie is a beautiful work and a great wonder for our eyes. Scott directs the battle with great ability, helped by the editing of the great Italian Pietro Scalia (Academy Award winner for 'JFK'): the initial battle in the woods is frenetic and impressive with the force of a thunder and the fights in the arenas are exceptional, a demonstration of what the evolution in movies can do. And also the cast, which sometimes is sacrificed for the show, shows a very great power: Russell Crowe is a suffering but determined Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix an evil, weak and complex Commodus, Connie Nielsen is so beautiful than good actress and then there is a great english trio formed by Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed (dead during the shots). Giorgio Cantarini (Benigni's son in 'La Vita è Bella') plays the brief role of Maximus' son. We mustn't also forget the red photography by John Mathieson, the rich art direction of Arthur Max (a name, a program) and the wonderful themes composed by Hans Zimmer, featuring the splendid vocals of Lisa Gerrard. Wonderful!",10,4,5,2 January 2001
