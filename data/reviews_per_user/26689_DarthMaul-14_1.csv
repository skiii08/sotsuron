Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not That Bad
",This movie is pretty good.  It does have some flaws.  #1-The plot is weak.  Without going into detail about where Qui-Gon Jinn came from. #2-Darth Maul was shown for about 20 minutes through the whole movie and only said 20 words which ruined Ray Parks performance. #3-Jar Jar Binks was annoying and useless.  I understand he was meant for a younger audience but after a while he got very annoying with his 'How Rude.'I though Natalie Portman was great as Queen Amidala and Liam Neeson's performance was also decent.  The best part was the ending light saber sequence which i think was the best out of all of the star wars. Overall i gave it a 7/10. *** out of ***** stars.,10,1,2,23 April 2000
