Alien 3," Worst sequel ever made?
","'Alien' was a relentlessly bleak, beautifully atmospheric masterpiece of horror and dread, one of the few truly adult examples of the science fiction genre. Its sequel, 'Aliens,' was far less disturbing, aiming more for visceral, action-movie thrills; nonetheless, it was still a powerhouse of a movie, especially in its wonderful 'special edition' laserdisc incarnation. The notorious 'Alien 3,' on the other hand, is an utterly miserable failure, certainly the most insultingly juvenile follow-up to a good movie since the equally terrible 'Return of the Jedi.' From its hopelessly rushed, sloppily edited opening title sequence, to its endless, murky 'alien-cam' chase finale, 'Alien 3' consists of nothing more than a shocking series of miscalculations on the part of the filmmakers, who manage to create not even one moment of suspense, horror or thrills in nearly two hours of MTV-styled tedium. Particularly frustrating (and embarrassing) for the viewer is watching Sigourney Weaver and Lance Henriksen, two great performers, struggle to create anything interesting with their underwritten characters; both fail horribly. Even 'Alien 4' looks great in comparison to this, possibly the worst sequel ever made.",1,663,875,17 October 1998
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Revenge of the Teddy Bears
","How can any adult who enjoyed 'Star Wars' and 'The Empire Strikes Back' possibly find anything entertaining, or even interesting, about this abysmal, unimaginative travesty?  A genuinely bad movie, truly awful in every possible way, 'Jedi' features a screenplay aimed squarely at four year olds and absolutely terrible acting from an understandably embarrassed cast; in addition, the film offers us the shoddiest array of cheap, plastic-looking space aliens since Irwin Allen's 'Lost In Space' tv series. Yes, I realize it is this very cheapness that endears the movie to a legion of kitsch loving fans, but, as a direct follow-up to 'Empire,' one of the most entertaining and inventive fantasy movies of the last twenty years, 'Jedi' comes across as a particularly insulting spit in the face from George Lucas.  And those godawful teddy bears!  Is there anyone out there (over the age of four, that is) who doesn't cringe in horror at just the mere thought of those monstrously cute creatures?",1,71,157,17 October 1998
The Thing," Grim, genuinely frightening horror epic
","Easily John Carpenter's best film, 'The Thing' is that rarest of movie rarities -- a remake of a classic film that is every bit as good as the original.  Backed by a pounding, heartbeat-like synthesizer score from the brilliant Ennio Morricone, 'The Thing' opens (following a pre-titles UFO 'teaser') with striking, beautifully choreographed images of a low flying helicopter chasing a dog through a desolate, frozen landscape.  The finale is just as stunningly filmed, the story bleakly and ambiguously ending in that same landscape awash in redhot flames.  In between, 'The Thing' offers some of the most potently horrific sequences ever shot. John W. Campbell's original short story 'Who Goes There?' is followed much more closely here than in Howard Hawks' version, resulting in some awesomely effective man-to-monster transformations.  Although these make-up effects have been much copied since 1982, the film has lost little of its power to shock even the most jaded of horror fans.  Carpenter's direction is stylish and assured, filling almost every sequence with the maximum amount of dread and suspense possible.  Add Morricone's thumping, eerie music to the mix and you end up with one of the most terrifying of all movie experiences.  (The DVD and laser disc versions are highly recommended, crammed as they are with wonderful additional goodies, including a shot-by-shot audio track discussion by Carpenter and star Kurt Russell, as well as an informative eighty minute documentary of the film's production.)",10,0,1,17 October 1998
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Even funnier than 'Excalibur'
","One of the most outlandishly inventive modern additions to the King Arthur mythos, 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' is either the funniest movie ever made or the most gruesome form of torture ever devised; some people scream with laughter from its (wonderful) opening credits to its stunningly abrupt ending, while just as many others sit there stone-faced.  I had the distinct pleasure of watching 'Grail' with a friend who absolutely hated every minute of it, and this, of course, made all the jokes that much funnier for me. The Criterion Collection laser disc is highly recommended, with an audio track devoted to the very amusing recollections of co-directors Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones.",10,0,0,17 October 1998
