First Man," Armstrong was a badass.
","If you have a scan through the reviews here, there's a decent split between those who found First Man to be a semi-masterpiece and those who found it a little boring and even a little depressing.
For me, it was fantastic.
Another reviewer suggested that, it got him closer to comprehending the intensity of the moon landing than he had expected and I fully agree with this. Perhaps ignorantly, I've previously overlooking the achievements",9,6,12,1 December 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Missed the mark by a mile
","This isn't a 10 Star masterpiece, it's not even an 8 Star gem. Which is a shame because any movie about the life of Freddie Mercury, one of the greatest rock performers ever to strut the stage should have been so much more.
I don't want to hear Bohemian Rhapsody, twice. I've got it on iTunes. I don't want to watch the Live Aid performance, it's there on YouTube. I wanted to find out what Freddie was really like, what made him tick, and I didn't get it. I got a fairly one dimensional perspective of a rock star with his life chronologically altered to suit the movie. Queen never split up. FM's aids diagnosis came nearly 2 years after Live Aid. When you've got a subject as talented and captivating as Freddie Mercury, there's no need to change the truth.",5,5,13,14 January 2019
Downfall," Masterpiece
","I doubt it would be possible to make a grittier, more compelling account of the last few days in the bunker. The cast perform their roles with excellence, perfectly depicting the intensity and gravity of their situation.
A masterpiece of a drama interspersed with action scenes which keep me glued to the screen each time I watch the movie.",10,2,2,10 June 2018
