First Man," Captures the sacrifices experienced during the space race
","This is a great movie. It's gritty and realistic. This movie is not about the grandeur of reaching the moon, it's about the strife experienced by the dedicated people behind the endeavor. This may come off as depressing for some viewers, however it really works to convey the treacherous and morbid reality behind the space race. There is a constant level of suspense that keeps the viewer watching.",8,0,1,13 January 2019
Bird Box," I don't get the hype, it's an okay movie.
","First, a lot of people are calling this a rip off of A Quiet Place, it's not. They do share similar plot mechanics that add to the suspense of the movie, but that's about it. I think this movie EXTREMELY similar to M Night Shyamalan's 2008 movie The Happening. If anything Bird Box rips that movie off a lot. Both explore the aftermath of a mass suicide driven apocalypse perpetrated by an unknown entity. So if you want to compare it to anything, then compare it to that movie.Other than that, the movie is pretty average. It has some suspenseful parts, but most of this is anticlimactic because the 'flash back and forward' structure of the movie makes things predicatble. There are also holes that also make it predictable. For example, halfway through the movie, I turned to my girlfriend and asked her, 'what about blind people? What are they doing during this?'. The blatant omission of blind people in the earlier parts of the movie made the ending really predictable.Overall it was an okay movie and I really don't get the hype that this has been recieving.",6,0,4,29 December 2018
