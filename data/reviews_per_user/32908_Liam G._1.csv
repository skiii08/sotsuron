The Blair Witch Project," Different type of hype.
","People are saying that this film did not live up to the hype, but I don't think that word is specific enough.  This wasn't hyped like 'Godzilla' was or 'The Phantom Menace' was.  The hype behind this movie was mainly well received analyses from the nation's top critics.  In this way, 'hype' should not be used as the slur it usually is.  As far as my review of the movie itself, I think this is truly one of the greatest horror movies of all-time.  I've seen many horror flicks and some have made me scream, squirm, and become silent a little.  This is the only film I have ever seen that had my heart beating rapidly and left me with images I couldn't shake for days.  I think the reason why some people have not liked this movie as much as I have is because many people need a singular object in a movie to scare them (i.e. Jason with a chain saw or Michael Myers with a butcher knife).  This movie combines many eerie elements with remarkable character development into the story.  You must pay attention to the littlest detail (especially at the beginning) to understand the true terror this film conveys.  My message to everyone is: Allow yourself to become wrapped up in the intricacies and the character's plight in 'The Blair Witch Project,' and maybe you'll have one of the greatest film experiences of your life. Maybe.",Null,0,1,6 August 1999
