The New World," A Slow Movie with Too Many Jumps
","Interesting, a movie where the lead characters are barely named and the director assumes that everybody all ready knows the story. While the acting was done superbly, the directing was horrible.The movie is nearly impossible to follow. Add to that constant cut scenes, voice overs from characters who have hardly spoken, and a plot line that hardly goes from point A to anywhere. I saw the movie for free and was upset that I'd paid for a soft drink and a bag of skittles. Honestly, if I'd realized that my father had felt the same about the movie while it was playing, I would have left half way through.",1,2,7,16 February 2006
