Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Force is back with us
","The Phantom Menace has been called the most anticipated movie ever by many and it doesn't disappoint. Although it was battered by critics before it opened I felt that there was something missing from it. Well where should I begin,  I think there should have been a dialogue between Maul and the two Jedi's before or during their fight although their lightsabre fight was amazing. The alien creatures should have spoken not english but Lucas should have created an alien language like he did so many times in the three original films. For the viceroy and the gungans.  And the other one is that he shoulnd't have made everything computer generated, he should have given us more realistic things like ships e.t.c.  Overall the movie was excellent and I can't wait for Episode Two for the earlier rumors I have heard it has a better conflict and the clone wars are coming so I'm looking foward for Episode 2 coming in May of 2002.",Null,0,0,15 June 1999
