Hereditary," Give it some time and it might impress you
","Hereditary is over 2 hours and I think you really feel that runtime, 
It keeps you at an arms length up until the last 30 minutes when it just goes balls to the wall insane.
Throughout the first hour and a half basically it is very slow and very boring with only a few scares mixed in to keep you interested. 
For me personally It pushed me right to the brink of Irritation and boredom multiple times, You have to want to like this movie because if you dont 
these few and far between scares will not hold you attention. as for the last bit of the movie it has some of the most haunting imagery that will 
stick in you head for a long time. You should see this if you want something truly Unique and unsettling, But be ready to put in a little work staying focused when the movie doesnt really give you a lot to work with. Also the acting, cinematography, and set design were all amazing. One last thing I appreciated was how the movie is willing to let you miss a scare
or something creepy in the background so more observant viewers really feel rewarded it doesn't feel like its pandering and doing a close up shot on everything spooky. Its just like a nice little bonus for people really paying attention.",7,1,6,8 June 2018
