Mission: Impossible III," Gritty realism replaces slick set-pieces
","Our favorite IMF agent Ethan Hunt is back and the suspense never lets up in this second installment of the 'Mission: Impossible' series. Why second you say? Because I would prefer to forget the atrocious second installment. It's dead to me. We may never forgive you, Woo.This series is really the new James Bond. The real Bond series became a bloated self-parody years ago when the comical Roger Moore took the character in that direction. The 'Mission: Impossible' series is equally implausible but at least takes itself seriously.Ethan Hunt is the impossibly competent agent who can keep his cool under all circumstances and double-cross the double crossers. Cruise gives Hunt an energy and fire that make him a compelling and likable character. But unlike the first installment when he was always a step ahead of his nemesis, here Hunt starts out behind the eight ball.To continue the Bond analogy, this episode of Mission: Impossible reminds me of 'From Russia with Love'. In that classic 'Connery' Bond, our hero is constantly being out-smarted and beaten up by the bad boys of S.P.E.C.T.R.E. until he finally uses his wits and talents to pull out the win.In the first 'Mission: Impossible', Hunt is set-up and manages to cleverly manipulate his knowledge of the system to expose the true mole, redeem himself and ride off into the sunset.This film is a different story. From the start the rules have changed. Hunt is certainly not in control. He is reacting the best he can to variety of difficult challenges. (Some could be described as 'impossible'.) Philip Seymour Hoffman proves, once again, that he is an extraordinary actor by making us hate his evil character with every fiber of our being. The other characters seem one dimensional except for Ving Rhames warm and decent Luther character. The action is non stop and the action scenes are paced quickly and chaotic in the style of modern action films. Gone are DePalma's smooth and slickly packaged set-pieces but a gritty realism is in it's place. Except for a few moments of much needed humor, this film is bleak and unromantic in it's portrayal of the life of a top agent like Ethan Hunt.I would recommend seeing this film if you are a fan of the first movie.",7,0,2,8 May 2006
Catch Me If You Can," This had been on my list and I finally saw it
","I don't know why I had delayed seeing this movie for so long. I'm a Spielberg fan so I would usually not hesitate. Maybe I wasn't so sure how Leonardo Dicaprio would handle this role. Maybe it was because a ton of other 'must-see' movies were out at the same time. Well, I finally saw and I'm glad. I can report that Dicaprio did a great job and that all the reviews criticizing Tom Hanks' Boston accent were wrong. I'm not saying his accent was perfect, far from it, but Hanks needed that little something to keep the viewer from thinking 'Hey, that's Tom Hanks!' Hanks gives an understated performance that made me think that he is a better actor than I gave him credit for. (I know, I know he has two Best Actor Oscars) His mannerisms and the accent were different enough to allow me to accept his character and suspend my disbelief. Even if the acting had been horrible, the direction, the credit sequence, the music, the cinematography and the art direction would have me recommending this film. There were times when the story was poignant and bitter-sweet and moments where I found myself grinning in the theater. Any piece of art that can evoke emotion is a success on some level. I suggest seeing it in the theater.",8,0,1,30 January 2003
Minority Report," Spielberg said it: 'Gourmet Popcorn'
","SPOILERS! He was correct. Positives:This futuristic Hitchcockian mystery is entertaining for almost it's entire length. Cruise is grave and intense and not allowed to mug here. There is excellent acting by even the bit players, many of whom have served adequately in other Spielberg franchises such as the 'Jurassic Park' series. The integration of design, concepts and human interface with technology is superb throughout the film. Repeat for emphasis: The integration of design, concepts and human interface with technology is superb through the film. Some of the action sequences were fantastic and lacked the cliches of many modern action films. Spielberg showed he is back to his old form as a master of the medium. The future world is neither Blade Runner Hell nor Star Trek Federation Utopia, but it appears reasonable, believable and real. {Side note: With Episode II being watchable and this film it appears Lucas and Spielberg have something left in the tank.} Nitpicks: The filmmakers included a few moments such as an extended exposition by the old woman (who invented the 'Pre-Cogs')to bring the slow members of the audience up to speed. Personally, I felt that it was unecessary. I felt that the inclusion of Cruise's wife as a member of the good guys didn't quite ring true. The epilogue message from Cruise that 'Pre-Crime' was shut down was not needed. In fact, this is the issue that was almost completely ignored. Of COURSE it was shut down!!! You can't hold people, even talented individuals, sedated in a tank of warm milk against their will! The people using the 'Pre-Cogs' in this film were no different from the computers in 'The Matrix' . The end does NOT justify the means.
The first climax of the film was Cruise's character 'Anderton' defying the 'precognition' and choosing a new future thus confirming his free will. This should have been the end, in my opinion. After this, the audience is spent, we are emotionally invested in the Anderton (Cruise) character. We don't need a formulaic 'conspiracy uncovered' sub-plot but we get it anyway.  By the way, if the writers can understand such an important and vital concept as free will why would they need to explain that the 'Pre-Crime' unit is shut down? How could it continue? Also if the pre-cogs saw the man's wife and her lover killed by the angry husband why not just remove the 'other' man?  One last nit pick: What was with the Verhoeven-esque commercial for Pre-Crime? It was beneath Spielberg.",8,0,0,22 June 2002
The Big Lebowski," A classic, near perfect film
","This film is totally unique in a world of sequels, copy-cat and cookie-cutter films. This movie is absolutely hilarious with an immensely talented ensemble cast and sharp Coen brothers writing. It's one of those films that gets better with each viewing because you notice more detail and nuance. Jeff Bridges was made for this role. John Goodman proves his genius. The bit players are all perfect. This film turns the 'private eye noir' genre on it's head and into a truly enjoyable and unpredictable twister game. Along with 'Miller's Crossing' it's one of the Coen Brothers movies that has the dialogue and writing to stand among the classics like 'Casablanca'.",10,2,4,7 December 2004
Constantine," Unoriginal
","This film was a disappointment and the bad news is that I wasn't expecting much. I can almost hear the pitch for this film. ' Instead of being original this film is simply a Keanu vehicle like 'The Matrix' with some action sequences stolen from 'Blade', it has the childish pop theology of 'Prophecy' (although 'Prophecy' was far better) and it has an apocalyptic finale not unlike that of 'Ghostbusters'. Throw in a supernatural little film-noir/anti-hero gumshoe from 'Cast a Deadly Spell' and you have 'Constantine'. The film had decent special effects but nothing too amazing by today's standards. I say rent it and save your money.",6,1,14,23 February 2005
The Others," A atmospheric, suspenseful, physchological thriller with a supernatural twist
","I enjoyed this film. For one thing, it actually shut up the loud group of teenagers in the theater where I saw it, and any film that can do that earns my respect. This movie doesn't use over-the-top (stupid) CGI rather it uses the absence of light and noise to unsettle the viewer and we really start to inhabit that drafty old house. I also was intrigued to see Catholicism strictly portrayed by Nicole Kidman's character throughout the film as a disciplinary tool for her children. It's a film that works best on the first viewing and would be more effective in the theater than at home (unless you have a $20,000+ home theater)",Null,0,0,25 August 2001
Ocean's Twelve," Too clever for it's own good.
","A heist movie works on the premise that the audience is in on the heist. We dread the incredible security measures. We get to see the planning and the development. We marvel at the skills of each expert. We experience the same suspense and drama as the characters. Ocean's Twelve discards all these elements in favor of creative editing, avant garde camera work and superficial writing. It tries to extract great performances from so-so actors. O.K. so they all are beautiful people. That doesn't mean they are automatically the best actors. It doesn't mean that they can carry a film on their performances. Clooney and Pitt are no Newman and Redford. The acting talents of Catherince Zeta-Jones have never been anything to write home about. Only Finney in a tiny cameo draws any real emotion from the audience.The best heist movies have real suspense. This film has none. The outcome is never in doubt. No matter how the surface of the plan is seemingly foiled...everyone is in on the far deeper 'actual' plan.On major problem is Garcia's character. If the original '11' successfully pulled off the job we are made to believe they did in the first film, they wouldn't panic and crumble like a house of cards to Benedict's pressure and scare tactics. In fact, once a member of the cadre had been contacted, survelliance would have captured Benedict's strong arm tactics and bellicose threats immediately. The man would have legal challenges beyond belief. It's not enough to know who robbed you. You must have proof, otherwise the worst threats would be a laughing matter for seasoned pros.",6,54,107,12 December 2004
Ocean's Thirteen," Nice to see some class and style in Hollywood
","After seemingly endless movies about torture and depravity, it's nice to see some class and style re-injected into the Hollywood film. 'Ocean's 13' recaptures the style and charisma in the first film and maybe even brings a bit of the style of the Rat Pack back into the picture.O.K., so it's vacuous, materialistic and lacks substance...we know that going in, so it's simply a measure of style, sophistication and humor. This movie has all that, in spades (it had to be said.) The latest installment of 'Oceans' is witty and charming and even self-referential without having to try and overtly re-create successful scenes from the previous films.Pacino makes a much better heavy than Andy Garcia, who reprises his role as the nemesis/wanna-be member of Ocean's gang.",8,2,6,10 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The experiment has failed.
","I'm sad to say that the experiment has failed. It is impossible to entirely create a digital world and expect actors and actresses to react and respond to their environments naturally. It is also true that digital 'C.G.I.' characters are not viable main actors in a feature motion picture especially when they are on-screen with real actors. In other words just because you CAN do a thing, doesn't mean you necessarily SHOULD do it. Allow me to digress: Spielberg's 'A.I.' was a good example. By Spielberg's own admission, had he found a way to make the shark work, he would have used it more in 'Jaws'. Instead of the classic atmospheric and suspensful film 'Jaws' is, it would have been closer to a B-movie. Sometimes your limitations FORCE you te be creative. George Lucas' best films: the original 'Star Wars', 'THX-1138' and 'American Graffitti' were all made on shoestring budgets with all sorts of constraints and problems.Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones' is, on some levels, a failure. The plot is mostly set-up and exposition. In the first part of the film you can feel it. Some of the dialogue and acting is painfully bad. Some of it is good. A few scenes at the end of the film rival 'Episode IV: A New Hope' and 'Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back' Several homages to other films can be discerned: Spacecraft reminiscent of both 'Tron' and '2001:A Space Odyssey' and one entire portion of the film was ripped off from John Ford's 'The Searchers'. The thing that I loved about the original $12 Million dollar 'Star Wars' was how real it felt. The dust and sand, the bleakness of Tatooine. The dank, mustiness of the Mos Isely Cantina (spelling?) The dark shiny alloys on the Death Star were real and we could feel them and relate to them. Very few times did this film evoke the feelings and the reality of the original. A few times I must admit being 'awed' by the imagination of the creator, but at no time did it feel like the work of an 'auteur'. I was just admiring some creative graphic designers touch. I think it's worth seeing in the theater if you are a fan of the series, but it wasn't worth waiting 3 and 1/2 hours for. I expect more of a film that a few great sequences surrounded by mediocrity. So sue me, my 12 year old nephew loved it.",7,0,1,17 May 2002
The Bourne Ultimatum," Gritty, dynamic and engrossing
","The 'Jason Bourne' series of spy movies has been a great showpiece for Matt Damon who coolly cruises through these films like a Tiger Shark waiting for his next victim. He is seemingly always one step ahead of the espionage bureaucrats who seek him and one move faster than the latest 'asset' assigned to neutralize him.It is sickening, but not surprising that federal government employees would devote the taxpayer time, effort and dollars to covering their behinds, but as an employee of the federal government I can assure the viewer that it is not that far off base.While I doubt a rogue agent would alarm them much, I do know that media exposure of their training and methods would draw much ire from the public and heat from their superiors.Damon was made for the role because he oozes confidence and competence and brings a graveness to his mission as Jason Bourne.Perhaps a bit too much hand-held made some of the action scenes a tad bit more confusing for the viewer. This, while trying to heighten realism, actually prevents the viewer from suspending his or her disbelief which is a prerequisite for a movie with a super-spy in it.In other words, if we, the audience, with the 'third person omniscient' viewpoint can barely follow the action, it becomes unbelievable that Bourne, even with his super spy skills and instincts, could possibly predict the actions of his friends and enemies. The crowed train station scene recalled the brilliant mall set-piece in 'Minority Report' with Damon in the role of the 'pre-cog' who could see the future or at least accurately predict the next move of his nemesis. I thought, 'Man, if one of those doors were locked, this scene and this movie would be over by now.'",7,3,7,9 August 2007
The Aviator," Worthwhile and interesting biography
","Martin Scorcese does not reach the heights I felt he reached in 'Gangs of New York' but his bio-pic of Howard Hughes is, for the most part, gorgeous and well-done. DiCaprio proves he is up to the challenge as does the rest of the cast.Scorcese is such a talented director that I wish he would focus his talents on some smaller projects, because three hours can be a bit overwhelming.The music and cinematography are used to great effect and, at times, I became totally immersed in the story forgetting that the actors I was watching weren't the actual people.The CG effects were not quite on par with some recent sci-fi and fantasy epics by the likes of George Lucas and Peter Jackson, but the visceral impact of many of the flight scenes was terrific.I felt the focus on Hughes obsessive-compulsive hypochondria was a bit overdone, but important to show the internal struggle of the character. I went in to the picture thinking 'Tucker: A Man and his Dream' and left thinking 'A Beautiful Mind'.",7,1,3,3 January 2005
Hot Rod," Funny in the way that your friend is funny...
","...And you aren't sure if everyone else 'gets it'.This movie likes to party. 'Hot Rod' has a real silly sense of humor and eschews most artificial plot advancers that weigh down other SNL-based film comedies.Much of the humor was juvenile and stupid, but a good portion of that was funny enough to keep me in the seat.I predict that either you will like 'Hot Rod' or you'll hate it. I don't think it will have a 'Napolean Dynamite' type following although you get the sense that that was the intent.Lots of 80's in-jokes and spoofs that will be lost on much of today's youth who were weaned on Jack-Ass, Jim Carrey, Captain Planet and cell-phones.",7,11,21,9 August 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Forgive my shock...
","...but I stepped out of the theater, and out of Middle-Earth, only a few hours ago. Seeing 'Fellowship' wasn't like just 'seeing a movie'. In fact, it was more like a trip inside my own mind as I read the Tolkien masterpiece. Peter Jackson has created a film experience that is as invigorating as reading the 'Fellowship' for the first time. I did not think it possible. The various plot changes were not sacrilegious in this purists mind and mostly they made cinematic sense. Highly recommended.",10,0,0,19 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," Convoluted and confused but Matrix fans will enjoy it
","May contain SPOILERS! Make no mistake the Matrix trilogy was ambitious. The first film was as tight and well done as the second film was sloppy. The third film in the series 'Matrix Revolutions' continues the Wachowski brothers foray into the world of destiny, technology, religion, and spirituality with mixed results.
There are some great and engrossing scenes in this film and some mind-blowing effects. In fact, the effects are so frequent and so much a part of the narrative (and seemingly every shot) that the viewer's mind quickly dismisses the technical achievement of this film. They shouldn't.
What should be dismissed is the painfully obvious attempt to include a person of every race, creed, ethnicity etc. The cast of surviving humans is annoyingly predictable. The film is basically 'Tron meets Terminator'. Think about it. Self-aware machines have all but decimated mankind except for in a virtual world of their creation where the battle is fought between programs who have 'users' in the real world. Issues like hope, faith, free will, resurrection, predestination, and redemption are brought up often, but the writer-director(s) don't follow through with their thoughts. It's almost as if they were consciously trying to avoid repeating the laughable exposition of the 'architect' that was widely criticized in the second film. Avoiding that is certainly a good thing. Mixing metaphors and spreading and analogy too thin isn't.It seems to me that that the strength of Hugo Weaving's performance left the film arguing on behalf of Agent Smith perhaps more persuasively than the Wachowski's would have liked.However the film was edited well and there were few moments where I cringed at the acting of Reeves. He has a good handle on his character as do the other main cast members. The action and fight scenes were impressive and didn't repeat as much as the second film. All in all, I think fans of the series will be satisfied. Those who thought 'The Matrix Reloaded' was as bad as I did will only have their suspicions confirmed by 'Revolutions'",6,1,2,6 November 2003
28 Weeks Later," Brutal, exhausting, brilliant and powerful
","Few movies can approach the level of brutality, suspense, horror or intensity of '28 Weeks Later'. A follow-up to the brilliant, eerie, low budget '28 Days Later', the sequel takes us to dark places only hinted at in the first film. I must warn you this film is unsparingly violent and mercilessly horrific, with scenes of family members killing each other.The film contains a scene that is truly heart-rending as a man's cowardice overpowers his love for his wife as we (and she) watch in disgust as he decides to bail out in the face of an insurmountable challenge. Later, this same man comes face to face with the wife he abandoned, now a carrier of the disease, not truly 'infected'. She transfers the virus to him in a kiss and she helplessly watches as rage consumes him and turns him into an infected. Strapped to a table, she is subjected to his fatal attack as he kills her for the second time.Like I said, brutal, repulsive and extremely dark stuff.Innocent people are senselessly slaughtered by the infected in a scene that almost re-creates the story told by the character 'Mark' from the first film. In that film, he describes being in a mob as the rage virus spreads and panic is transformed into bloody mayhem.Innocent people are also slaughtered as a military force comes to terms with the concept of collateral damage. To keep the virus from spreading they target those who have not yet been infected. The abhorrent idea becomes more of a pragmatic survival strategy rather than an difficult ethical question as the disease spreads.The only criticism I have (and what keeps me from rating the film higher)is that too many coincidences happen throughout the film which bring cast members together and into 'yet another' dangerous frightening circumstance. It makes for a scary and jolting film certainly but it stretches the audience capacity for suspending their disbelief. After all, you can scarcely believe people would continue to go into dark underground confined areas knowing that survival was unlikely.The solution to this horrible infection is clearly smaller controllable populations that can be isolated. Imagine multiple, secure self-contained areas of one hundred people or less. If any sign of infection happens it's far easier to simply segregate a small section of the population and let the disease flare up and burn itself out in 28 days. Also, to easily identify infected from non-infected in a crowd situation a simple announcement over a P.A. with instruction would be required. Tell all non-infected to run with their hands over their heads (or some similar instruction that infected would not understand) and it would be relatively simple to pick off the infected while avoiding innocent casualties.",9,0,3,1 June 2007
The Village," Spoilers! A riddle wrapped up in an enigma wrapped in an O.K. movie
","The current mind-blower of American cinema is at it again. M. Night Shyamalan has carefully crafted another interesting exercise for the viewer.
I say exercise because this film lacks the heart present in Shyamalan's earlier works 'The Sixth Sense' or 'Signs'. I might as well get the spoiling out of the way now because in order to move on to the themes of the film it is required. The story of the film is a sham within a sham. The residents of a 19th century 'village' are actually hostages of a group of crazed or fanatical neo-puritans who call themselves the 'elders'. These elders keep control over their totalitarian mini society through the use of clever manipulation and propaganda techniques. They have convinced all the other residents of the town that to leave the borders of the town is certain death at the hands of some mythical or supernatural creatures. They even portray these creatures using elaborate costumes in order to frighten the younger residents into submission. Their goal is to isolate and control the environment in order to separate the residents from what they see as a evil modern world. The next level of sham is that this '19th century' town isn't simply isolated from their industrial revolution age peers. They are actually a living, breathing human time-capsule existing within a huge nature preserve in the present day. The preserve was set up by the billionaire relative of William Hurt's character, who is a university professor.  The whole thing started when a grieving Hurt comes up with the bright idea that the elders, all members of a 'relatives of victims of violence' support group should start their sham society. I know, I know...it sounds contrived and it is. But the method to this madness is effective and eerie. I enjoyed the superb cinematography and good performances by Brodie, Phoenix, Weaver and Hurt. The dialogue must have been a chore to deliver and they do a passable job of keeping straight, even earnest expressions on their faces.
I'll pretty much see anything M. Night makes because it is never boring. I much prefer 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakable', and 'Signs' to this film. The end is either reassuring or horrible depending on whether you like faux-19th century totalitarian brainwashing or not.",7,0,0,4 August 2004
The Hills Have Eyes," Reprehensible and abhorrently manipulative film-making
","O.K. Three showers later and I'm in a state where I can analyze this gruesome, disgusting, piece of trash. If this movie hadn't had some scares and shock moments, I would have rated it even lower. Aside from a brutal first attack and clever decoy tactic using a horrific human barbecue (Does Ted Levine have to moan in every film?) it was predictable and formulaic.This movie was very manipulative and over-done. A great filmmaker could get the point across simply by letting the narrative depict the horror of a helpless baby and a teenage girl being trapped inside a trailer with two savage mutated freaks. Here, we have very average filmmakers so they resort to actually showing the events transpiring within. And what are those events? The two savage mutated freaks dry-hump and terrorize the girl and act threateningly towards the baby. OOOOOOOH! Excuse me while I'm not shocked. Lesson: Don't go through the motions of shocking us without any actual shock. Let's be clear: Shock is distinct from repulsiveness: Putting a child in harm's way and having a mutated freak breast-feed off a lactating woman while aiming a revolver at a baby is lower than most would stoop. Yes it's repulsive, but so is watching someone take a crap on stage or lick up vomit. It's beneath Wes Craven. Besides, everyone in the audience knew you wouldn't actually have the cajones to go through with the worst of it. Few movies actually make me mad. I can usually stay casually detached and objectively observant without seeing through the tactics so clearly. This movie made me mad. It insulted my intelligence. I could see what the director was trying to do a mile away and it was frustrating to watch as the fuse was lit only to have the bomb go off too soon.I liked the allusions to 'Straw Dogs' with the broken glasses etc. The 'Total-nerd-turned-scrappy-survivor' was a neat idea and the transformation was well handled. It always strikes me as funny how expert killers turn all thumbs in climactic showdowns. David slays Goliath so often in these glorified B-pictures that the betting line in Vegas always favors the little guy. A great horror movie will have three elements: 1. Good shocks and scare moments 2. an overall pervasive sense of dread 3. abstract conceptual terrorThis movie had all three elements but none were executed deftly or properly fleshed out. The shocks did come but were routine (Uhhh, guys? The fast sillouette moving by the camera has been done about a million times before!) The sense of dread was palpable in the first act, with just enough friction in the family to make it seem realistic, but enough family chemistry to make you dread what was going to happen. The abstract conceptual terror was that of human evolution or mutation due to radioactivity, but it was a poor rationale for the events depicted in the film.",2,2,7,16 March 2006
Cold Mountain," A starkly beautiful film of great emotional impact
","Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are two of the most beautiful people on the planet, so it shouldn't be difficult to understand why many critics are praising this film. Watching the emotions play upon their nearly perfect features is mesmerizing. Did any Confederate soldier really have teeth this good? Impressive performances by both leads (particularly Kidman's range) and a stellar cast bring this Civil War tragedy to a higher level. Brendan Gleeson and Philip Hoffman are wonderful. Natalie Portman is so convincing and heart-wrenching that one has to wonder what narcotics George Lucas had her on in Star Wars Episodes I and II. I will say that the opening battle scene was a huge disappointment. The choppy cuts and camera movement meant to give the documentary feel doesn't work here. The reason it worked so well in Spielberg's WWII era films ('Saving Private Ryan' and 'Schindler's List') is because there were actual gun cameras, footage of combat and newsreel documentary footage as a frame of reference. The film feels gritty and authentic in all other respects. Excellent suspense is maintained up through the rewarding and mature climax.",7,0,0,23 December 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Better than I expected
","T3 was a movie I actually dreaded seeing. I was simply sure it wasgoing to be awful. The trailers didn't impress me and Arnold wasan aging star with a few stinkers in his recent pass. I waspleasantly surprised. This film successfully upped the action antewhile lampooning the earlier films with a few very funny gags. Ifyou enjoyed the previous films you'll get some good laughs. Ipreferred the themes of T2 and The Terminator ( 'there is no futurebut what we make'; gritty realism of 'Terminator') to the theme ofthis film. The last 8 or 10 minutes drop off but there are enoughthrills and good scenes to tide you over. Arnold looks great for aguy in his 50's, but let's hope this series isn't his 401k plan.",7,0,0,8 July 2003
Spider-Man," Webheads rejoice!
","Spiderman has always been one of the most compelling superheroes because of his basic normalcy and goodness. Sam Raimi does a great job of letting the audience know who Peter Parker is and why he does what he does. It is far less of a psychological stretch than the Bruce Wayne/Batman alter-ego. Speaking on the 'Dark Knight', I would rate this film on par with the first 'Batman' movie. It had decent performances all around, although I didn't feel anyone reached the level of Jack Nicholson's 'Joker'. Dafoe gives it a shot. Cliff Robertson lends a touch of class to the proceedings. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker, he starts out as a good-hearted but nerdy teenager and becomes more and more confident and has a lot of fun with his super-powers.I don't know if the 'Green Goblin' was the best choice of villain but it works well for Spidey to have a nemesis that challenges him intellectually and well and physically. We mustn't forget that Peter is highly intelligent and I think a disservice was done by not letting him develop his own we-shooters. Still the movie was fun and should dominate the box-office this weekend.",7,0,0,4 May 2002
Collateral," Oozing coolness, Mann maintains focus mostly
","This movie has coolness dripping off it. It is well shot, expertly edited and the performances are good. The film starts slowly introducing only the characters it needs. The movie has very little fat from a narrative point of view. 'Collateral'  builds to a better climax than Mann's earlier L.A. Story 'Heat'. The tension level is established early but the stakes continue to rise. In another director's hands it would quickly become preposterous, but a stable and focused approach keeps the suspension of disbelief at acceptable levels. I think many scenes were shot on HD video. Foxx shows a good range and doesn't overplay his part. Cruise is, well Cruise. It's nice to see him play the bad guy. But he isn't strictly a traditional heavy. In the movie he is a sort of anti-villain, seemingly a devil/angel on the shoulder of Foxx. Similar to DeNiro in 'Heat'You don't really root against him except when it comes to the main conflict between he and the protagonist, Foxx. One of the main characters of this film is Los Angeles, and Mann doesn't skimp on the cheesecloth while showing the city. He must truly love the city of Los Angeles, because through his lens it looks loads better than it really does. I can understand his love of roads, freeways, and the mechanical and stark look of a city at night because I share it.
A modern city is a wonder of the world. It is a testament to the combined wills of millions of people. The way it looks and lives tells us much about it's residents. I think the director and writer capture this important element in 'Collateral'.",7,0,1,10 August 2004
Spirited Away," Surreal, beautiful and utterly engrossing
","If you want a sensational headline for this movie or motivation to go see it I can offer this: 'Wizard of Oz' meets 'Alice in Wonderland' meets the Brother's Grimm in a very japanese sort of way. This film has it all. Love, laughter, horror, confusion, suspense, serenity and like all good tales it teaches lessons. The animation is for the most part superb. The vocal talents of the english speaking actors is great and does not distract. The wild, surreal imagery and artistic quality of this movie is top-notch. You may never see anything quite like this again in your life. By far the most enjoyable japanese anime film I have seen (my previous favorites were 'Ghost in the Shell' and 'Akira'. I have a hunch japanese audiences would understand far more of the imagery and symbolism than I did. I'm sure at least some of the cast of characters in this film is as much a part of japanese culture as 'Paul Bunyan', 'Pecos Bill', and 'John Henry' are a part of American folklore.I do not hesitate to recommend this movie. It's worth full price on the big screen.",8,0,1,13 January 2003
Batman Begins," Best Batman since 'Batman'
","I was very impressed by the unwillingness of this film to give into superhero movie clichés and maintaining it's dark, but very 'Batman', tone throughout. The flashbacks were done well. The action scenes were tight and watchable. The production design was fantastic. In short, this movie was by far the best 'Batman' film since Tim Burton's excellent 'Batman'. One does not expect to see actors like Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Micheal Caine in less than leading roles, especially in a summer, superhero film. I suppose the quality and success of the 'Spider-Man' series has changed Hollywood's outlook somewhat.Liam Neeson was serviceable in his dual role as mentor/tormentor although his performance lacked originality. The pacing and editing was very quick and kept the visual suspense at a very high sustained level. The 'scarecrow' effect was great. I actually caught myself smiling as I watched it. I must admit I was worried about how they were going to make a lame villain like 'Scarecrow' scary. (I dare them to make 'Toyman' the bad guy next time!) I would recommend seeing it in the theater.",8,0,1,21 June 2005
28 Days Later...," Ghastly fun, chilling and sharp (Spoilers!)
","Danny Boyle tips his cap to George Romero's 'Dead Trilogy' and Boris Sagal's 'The Omega Man' a highly underrated sci-fi film starring Charleton Heston. '28 Days Later' is a crisp horror movie. It has the positives of being a gritty, realistic low-budget film without the drawbacks of bad acting, cheap thrills or pretentious ham-handed preaching. There are a few particularly horrifying (startling) moments in the movie including the scene in the church, the 'candle' scene, the stairwell scene. On another level of fear: Excellent tension is sustained, both in leaving the city (an eerie tunnel sequence pays homage to Stephen King's 'The Stand') as well as the strange quirks of the rag-tag military group. The final level of fear is the societal implications. Are we truly a society of consumer-crazed aggression? Is everybody else a danger to us? It certainly puts the condition of our species under the microscope. There is a scene in the film (in the store) straight out of 'Dawn of the Dead' and the captive 'infected' is reminiscent of Bub in 'Day of the Dead'. It is worth seeing in a darkened theater to heighten the impact.",8,0,0,28 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A Towering Achievement
","Spectacular filmmaking! Peter Jackson has taken his work to another level. 'Fellowship of the Ring' was a more deliberate and subtle film. 'The Two Towers' hammers you over the head with a visceral 'Welcome to Middle Earth' like a war hammer to the temple! With battle scenes (the intensity of which can only be compared to Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan) and more and scarier creatures, this film isn't for little ones so do them, yourself and everyone else in the theater a favor and find a sitter. Don't expect a typical action film. Don't expect a prologue to get you up to speed. If you haven't seen the first go and rent it immediately (preferably the extended special edition) This film is epic in every sense of the word. Superb. Some major plot changes from the book provide surprises and suspense for even the most well-read Tolkienite. (If you have a brain and a heart) you will love this movie!  As Winston Churchill said, 'This isn't the end, or even the beginning of the end, but perhaps it's the end of the beginning'",10,0,0,19 December 2002
Hero," A Chinese 'samurai' film borrowing heavily from Kurosawa
","This is a Chinese film but it struck me as very Japanese for a few reasons. First, the way the plot unravels is 'Kurosawa-esque' and some of the large battle scenes were reminiscent of 'Ran'. That being said, neither the plot nor the battle scenes were on the same level as Kurosawa.The film fails to make us sympathize with any of the characters. Go rent 'The Emperor and the Assassin' and 'The Emperor's Shadow' instead. If you have a hankering for fight scenes (violent ballet) watch 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'The use of color was excellent and some of the cinematography was beautiful particularly the scene by the lake.",6,0,2,19 September 2004
Transformers," a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury....signifying nothing
","The immortal words of Shakespeare came to mind as I watched Michael Bay's latest abomination of cinema. Why Shakespeare? Because he was a man who with little more than a stage and a few actors and some creativity he entranced hundreds, then thousands, now millions with stories with humor and heart. Basic human dramas rich with timeless themes.On the other end of the spectrum, we have Michael Bay, a T.V. commercial and music video director with about as much soul as a cappuccino machine. He has a budget of $100 million and the best special effects that money can buy and all he can come up with is this.This travesty. This is two-hour slickly produced, focus group honed Chevy commercial with some comic relief and some nostalgic Saturday morning cartoon robots thrown in for good measure. Is the new Camaro hot? Duh, that's like asking is Megan Fox is, well, a fox... Sure the vehicles look great and the effects were well done, but the film like it's vacuous director lacked a soul.People will say, 'But...it's a just a popcorn summer movie!' or 'It's the 'Transformers' what do you expect?' Well, I expect more than what I received for the ticket price.I expect some attempt at an interesting plot. Come on! Herbert Hoover hid it in the dam? Please. World class beauty falls for the insecure nerdy kid? Whatever. Optimus Prime wants to sacrifice himself to save the world? Nonsense.The film lacked scope. It lacked any sense of dramatic tension. It lacked suspense. The cartoonish over-the-top performances of Turturro and Voight were B-movie grade schlock.",4,5,12,27 July 2007
Children of Men," Bleak, pessimistic and unlikely vision of the future
","This film borrows heavily from the dark, brooding apocalyptic sci-fi downers of the late 60's and early 70's like 'Soylent Green' and 'Planet of the Apes' with a touch of 'Blackhawk Down' gritty realism thrown in for good measure. The basic plot consists of a journey with a protagonist who gives us very little reason to like, relate or sympathize with him.He is a former radical who is reintroduced to a former flame (Julianne Moore) whom he met during his protest days. The manner in which he becomes involved with these terrorists is contrived and forced.This future-world is littered with revolutionary and terrorist factions who have a desire for an 'uprising' against a 'big brother' police state. The missing fact and the only interesting storyline in the film is that mankind is barren, impotent and incapable of reproduction of the species. A single, teenage pregnant girl is discovered.The protagonist becomes her protector and guides us through this future world on her journey to 'The Human Project' and collection of enlightened souls who desire to save the human race. Exactly WHY they wish to save the human race is unclear. After all if humans are so noble and worthy of life why would their inevitable fate be a world divided into a despotic militarized regime and terrorist factions? It is the lack of any real alternatives that relegates this movie (and the anti-everything attitude of today's protesters)to utter irrelevance.",8,2,5,22 January 2007
Mulholland Drive," Not entirely unsuccessful.
","Some elements of this film seemed beneath David Lynch and almost had a Coen Bros. feel to them. On the other hand, a dark subject matter like this would scare most directors off. Excellent performances and subtle editing and cinematography set this movie apart from standard Hollywood fare and yet the film with it's lavish sets and locations can't help but remind the viewer of a Hollywood era that has come and gone. The film seems to falter only after climaxing prematurely and slowly fades, but it won't fade from our memory just yet.",7,0,0,22 April 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Psychedelic Yakisoba western musical shock-fest SPOILERS!
","Kill Bill is undoubtedly the greatest psychedelic yakisoba western kung-fu musical shock-fest ever made. This is in part because it is the only one ever made. At times I wished it never had been made. You get the feeling somewhere during the film that writer-director Tarantino is like a kid locked in a 'Toys R Us' overnight. There are just too many temptations. This film is at times slow, action-packed, witty, banal, humorous, sad, grotesque and beautiful. While the variations in tone waver between the hard-core chops of 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'spoofishness' that doesn't become Tarantino.
The violence in the film is outrageous and over the top. The clever use of anime is nearly blunted by some inept musical choices. In fact, musically the entire film plays like something out of Ennio Morricones nightmares. At times the blaring music and rythmic shots play like a music video gone wild. I was impressed with the performances. The film is almost an ode to Uma. I can think of worse ways to spend two hours than staring at Uma Thurman's beautiful and unique face. Some of the situations Uma finds herself in are almost incomprehensibly horrible. 'Kill Bill' is like watching the 'Pulp Fiction' overdose scene for two hours.
The cinematography was almost too polished for the narrative. The film looks very good. I like the 70-ish 'feature presentation' bit at the start of the picture.All in all, I couldn't recommend this film to the squeamish but I would hope that a brave viewer would give this unique picture a chance. I think it will find it's way to the 'cult' section in the video store nearest you in the future.",6,0,0,28 October 2003
Avatar," Absolutely horrible film
","As usual, James Cameron delivers a visual and technological tour de force while simultaneously proving that he has zero narrative originality and horribly clichéd story-telling concepts. In a different era, a writer director that put out this leftist propaganda would have been tarred, feathered and run out of town on a rail or perhaps even hung for treason. In our era of hypocrisy, no one even chuckles that a megalomaniac tycoon produces, writes or directs a multi-million dollar movie critical of the very economic conditions which ALLOWED IT TO BE MADE. Lame quasi-native American themes of 'Dances with Wolves' and 'A Man Called Horse' are clumsily interspersed with naive callow condemnation of corporate greed and the war on terror. A general nature worship pantheism pervades the shallow and ignorant philosophy shoved down the viewers throats. The bio-luminescent plant life is vaguely reminiscent of 'Lothlorien' in Lord of the Rings and is very beautiful until you realize that from a biological standpoint it serves no purpose and thus wouldn't exist. Alan Dean Foster's 'Midworld' is not the least of sci-fi authors who deserve credit or at least mention by Cameron for his 'Pandora'. The portrayal of the military in this film is insulting, naive and maybe treasonable.",3,6,14,10 January 2010
Grindhouse," Puerile
","The first half of 'Grindhouse' is an over-the-top, senselessly violent and gore-filled cliché of a zombie movie. Rose McGowan isn't 'all-that' and the only reason any of the acting can be applauded is because the actors manage to keep straight faces while spewing some of the all-time stupidest dialog ever written. I love George Romero. I love zombie movies. You, Mr. Tarantino and Mr. Rodriguez are certainly NOT George Romero.The second half of 'Grindhouse' is a suspenseful chase thriller with an excellent performance by Kurt Russell who is deliciously menacing in his role as a psychopath. The car scenes are excellent, although 'Bullitt', 'The French Connection', and 'Ronin' still have the best car chases. The problem with the second film is the same as the first: Tarantino (and perhaps Rodriguez) are grown men with the mentality of 14 year old boys. Their fascination with (and knowledge of) sex and violence is that of someone who has experienced neither. It's like listening to a couple of virgins brag about sex or a couple of boys who have never fought talk about fighting.Tarantino's idea of feminism is to make his female heroins as inane, obnoxious, reprehensible and vulgar as their male counterparts. Some equality...Cleverness is not intelligence. Kitsch is not art. Moxie is not courage. Damning them with faint praise, I can say that these films are, without a doubt, clever, kitschy, and produced, written and directed with a lot of moxie. Tarantino has an ear for dialog (even if he overindulges himself in this respect) and a thorough knowledge of pop culture and film history. I can admire his homage to films of the past, but wish he would find his own, worthy, voice as he did in 'Pulp Fiction'.With his performances in these films, I think we can all agree that regardless of his directorial gifts and writing talents, Tarantino must never, repeat, NEVER be allowed to act again. His appearance on screen is distracting and nearly stops each movie in it's tracks.Even with all this, the funky, 70's style drive-in intros and trailers are a hoot. The trailer for the slasher-horror movie 'Thanksgiving' is worth the price of admission.",6,30,42,19 April 2007
National Treasure," A dusty gem, and worthy effort to give the young-uns a lesson
","The !SPOILERS! in this review are located below and clearlymarked. Let's get the critique out of the way first. 1. Character development: non-existent. 2. Set pieces: boring, but of historical interest. 3. Dialogue: Sub-par. 4. Believability: Zero. And yet despite these weaknesses, I liked the movie! Let's face it, Nicholas Cage is a likable actor and that's why it works. His sidekick is perilously close to being the most annoying sidekick since Jar... (He who must not be spoken of)The female lead is very attractive but has a noticeable accent which makes me wonder which director/producer she is dating to get this role. Otherwise, she is pretty good at running around and zinging one-liners.The typical Bruckheimer formula of non-stop action is deftly executed by director Turteltaub and the historical significance of various major national landmarks is interspersed between chases and scenes in which clues are discovered.!SPOILERS!The screenplay was dumbed-down enough for me to get the 'valley forge' and the 'daylight savings time' references before the characters on screen blurted them out. Thanks for making me feel smart! I liked the dedication to American history (and faux-history) showed by Nicholas Cage's character. Our country would do well with more true patriots and knowledgeable individuals.!SPOILERS!",6,0,1,7 December 2004
Pulp Fiction," A clever and non-linear approach to questionable subject matter
","It definitely has it's moments, but in the end it isn't a movie that demands multiple viewings. It's not subtle and isn't very realistic. It's still a trip down the rabbit hole to see Tarantino's mind on display, but why is he in all his movies? The excessive language actually takes more from the film than it adds upon subsequent viewings. The movie is good, but by no means worthy of it's high ranking in the 'IMDB top 250'. It was very trendy for a time to LOVE this film and many non-film fans thought they were being 'hip' for jumping on the bandwagon. Has it done anything to advance the art of cinema?",7,1,2,19 June 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Sometimes if you expect greatness better than average is a bummer.
","I cannot tell you how disappointed I was by this film. To give you some perspective, I loved 'The Matrix'. I saw it three times in the theater and I own the DVD. I loved 'The Matrix' because  1. It allowed a certain ambiguity. 2. It didn't spoon-feed the audience 3. It didn't take itself too seriously.'The Matrix Reloaded' comes across as a typical Hollywood sequel: Repeat/Augment the successful scenes of the first film, Add some interesting characters and blow the whole thing with exposition and convolution. I expected more from the Wachowski Brothers.I will be the first to admit there were some incredible visual sequences. Some fights and chases were executed in fine form, but I found myself thinking during some of the extended martial arts scenes: 'Why am I watching Keanu Reeves in a wire harness in 'bullet-time' when I can watch a true artist like Bruce Lee in my copy of 'Enter the Dragon'? In light of the true nature of 'the matrix' all the fist-fighting and gunplay seems superfluous and ultimately filler until the next expositional moment in the script. In other words, sure there were some cracker-jack action scenes, but they didn't advance the plot a whole lot. A great action film usually requires a lot of suspension of disbelief on the part of the audience, but at some point the whole 'jacking into and out of the matrix gimmick' requires a new level of suspension of disbelief. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is an example of  another film with many cracker-jack action scenes but the difference is the scenes actually advanced the plot.
Speaking of exposition, I kept waiting for Micheal York from the 'Austin Powers' movies to show up. I mean, COME ON! Somebody tell the screenwriters that the high-school level philosophy class isn't impressing anyone over the age of 18. The first film did a much better job of avoiding making the audience feel like they should take  dictation without coming across as shallow. This film does precisely the opposite by talking itself in circles and in the end appearing vacuous.Also another suggestion to the filmakers: keep the power level of Neo consistent. In one scene he can disrupt the entire matrix with his 'wake' and in another five dudes with less skill that Agent Smith keep him occupied for far too long. Either he is omnipotent or he is not. If he is omnipotent within the matrix you don't have much of a story. The Wachowski's seem to want to have it both ways.OK, I admit I'll shell out the $10.00 to see the next one and ultimately that determines the financial success of a movie, but box-office receipts do not determine whether a film reaches it's potential as a classic series as 'The Matrix' could have.",1,1,1,15 May 2003
A Beautiful Mind," A film about an anti-Semitic philanderer is not worthy of best picture
",This film should not win the academy award for Best Picture or Best Adapted Screenplay because it was neither this year. A true candidate for Best Picture wouldn't leave out significant events of a person's life. A true best adapted screenplay wouldn't ignore unpleasant elements in the name of box-office returns and political correctness. What could have been a great film has been turned into a less than great movie. Too bad.,3,2,5,17 March 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," An awful lot of story for even a long kids movie!
","Having recently re-read the book prior to viewing the film, I won't bore anyone with listing the changes or omissions, most of them made sense and worked with the flow of the story. I enjoyed the book version of 'Chamber of Secrets' more than the book version of the 'Sorcerer's Stone' so I went to the theater expecting quite a bit. The first film exceeded my expectations and, again, this raised my level of expectations for the second film. Richard Harris, Kenneth Branagh, and Daniel Radcliffe are all quite good and although the direction is brisk and involving some of the editing is not quite as crisp as 'Sorcerer's Stone'. The Quidittch match is great and there are no distractions in the form of obvious computer generated characters. Doby, the house elf, is one of the better CGI characters I have yet seen. Is it perfect? I think the story is just too involved for a 2 hour kids film. There are a few layers of complexity and depth that simply work as literature and don't quite translate to the medium. !SPOILER!

Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," If you like Will Ferrell yelling all his lines you'll love it!
","Let's get something straight, I think Will Ferrell is a funny, funny man. I have some of his appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien because he is so damn hilarious while improvising. Some scenes in this movie are very, very funny. Many other fall flat. I have come to the conclusion that Ferrell is funny in short spurts, but it's too much to expect that his over-the-top yelling of his lines would be funny throughout an entire film.I have been lamenting the marathon sketches on SNL for years and, at times, this movie plays like a 90 minute SNL sketch. Alas, it seems Vince Vaughn is wasted in anything not written and directed by Jon Favreau. No one 'gets' him. Steve Carell is awesome.",6,3,7,19 September 2004
Hitch," A well-done romantic comedy
","Will Smith returns to the big time with a role that proves he has the talent and likability to be a big-time box office draw. Eva Mendes is adorable and admittedly sizzling but methinks she lays it on 'a bit thick'. Let's just say William Shatner would be proud. Kevin James proves he has the talent and charisma for great success on the big screen. Smith plays one of the apparently millions of people in Manhattan who dress well, have inexhaustible supplies of cash and TONS of free time (as well as impeccable taste in decorating) O.K. my griping is over. The movie is well executed. Nothing really revolutionary in terms of writing or direction. But everything is deftly done and the plot moves along with enough twists and turns to keep the viewer 'infatuated'. The movie has very funny moments but also has some interesting observations about male-female relationships and 'dating' in general.",8,0,1,16 February 2005
Shooter," terrible terrible ideas makes terrible terrible movies
","First of all, I like Mark Wahlberg. He is the only reason I saw this film and I was rooting for him because he seems like a good guy and I think he can act. With that out of the way, I feel free that the reader will have no misconceptions that I am trying to slam Mark Wahlberg with my review. The movie, on the other hand, is another story. This is simply awful and derivative film-making. Plagiarism is punishable in school by expulsion. This movie copied so many others it's hard to know where it became original. I will list the movie and the way in which this film copied it: 'The Bourne Identity' (highly trained agent uses his know-how to stick it to the man), 'Sniper' (obvious reasons) 'Arlington Road' (expert turns fall-guy), 'In the Line of Fire', (Washington intrigue and assassination plot) 'The Manchurian Candidate' (American hero turned brainwashed trained assassin) This film was reasonably paced and had some decent action scenes. The problem was that the people Wahlberg was killing weren't adequately identified. In much of the film, Wahlberg almost appeared to be a mindless 'Jason/Micheal Meyers' type character only he used a gun instead of a machete. Gratuitous violence with no cinematic message is poor film-making.Tip for the director, if you are going to try and make a 'realistic, gritty' film keep the tone consistent throughout. You can't turn your character into a bullet-proof superman. There was never any peril for the clichéd 'female interest' and the clichéd 'sidekick' was lame.Tip # 2 for the writer and director, if you are going to try and actually make sweeping geo-political statements don't load your movie up with every implausible conspiracy theory because by bundling sound and unsound ideas together you end up letting the rotten apple spoil the rest. Example: If I use the dialog of a character to impress upon the audience my belief that the Democrats and Republicans are just rich, evil, versions of the same thing, don't have the same character talk about fantastic plots to kill Kennedy or faked Moon Landing hoaxes. It just makes you look stupid.Isn't the movie going audience in America sick of the 'African tragedy device' as a plot gimmick? Anytime a screenwriter needs to portray a government official as evil, he slaughters an African village. I think more African villages have been slaughtered in bad screenplays more times that there ARE actual African villages.Africa is screwed up enough without having to have some corrupt western political wheel screwing things up worse. Besides the 'corrupt western political wheel' is the most overused cliché in these films and is the 2000's version of the black-hat wearing mustache-twisting movie villain in early silent films.",1,8,18,31 March 2007
Vanilla Sky," 'It's a Wonderful Life' meets 'Seconds' meets 'Coma'
","This is painful for me but I'll admit upfront that I haven't seen the original Spanish language film. I'll qualify that by saying I am the type who scoffs at the American re-make of 'The Vanishing' because it was so inferior to the original.      I have a hunch that this movie stayed pretty close to the INTENTION of the original. Considering the lame American re-makes usually focus on the 'gimick' of the original rather than give you any kind of true cultural filter on an original story this is a good thing. I know what Cameron Crowe meant when he said the film wouldn't leave his mind. I had a similar experience with the Russian film 'Come and See' (which I recommend highly). I kept telling people about it until I convinced a friend to watch it with me.     I won't give away to much of the plot, because this film is truly a story. When I say story, I mean more like a novel than a comic book. I will say that Tom Cruise did a great job in this film. I don't think Cruise gets enough respect for his acting because he is good-looking and he's a nice guy. Often people's talents get overwhelmed by popularity. Think of some of the most popular people at your high school. Just BECAUSE they were popular didn't a certain segment of the class despise them? Being popular didn't prevent anyone from being a good person (In fact, maybe being popular just allows you more leeway to show your true character.) The whole cast performs at a high level. Penelope Cruz is enchantingly cute. Cameron Diaz is horrifically attractive and menacingly flirty. Jason Lee is able to emote subtleties that evade many more well known and well regarded actors. Most importantly Crowe has forged a good story with crisp dialogue and a frustrating yet authentic vagueness of real life. It's all shot in a slick way without looking too much like a commercial yet with a definite emphasis on story-telling. I recommend the movie to those who aren't afraid to look a little inward and ask some big questions.",9,0,0,30 May 2002
Signs," Fantastic, Subtle, Riveting
","First of all Mr. Shyamalan, I am much too old, mature and jaded a movie-goer to be on the edge of my seat for 90 minutes. How dare you craft a piece of cinema so compelling, in this day and age when we have seen it ALL. How dare you subtlety tone your movie so it's emotional impact is thunderous? How dare you craft a film with real emotional resonance that doesn't use gushing music to cover it's hollowness? How DARE you defy the special effects gurus and show LESS and end up affecting the viewer MORE? How dare you employ the talents of the overlooked Tak Fujimoto as your DP and blow us away with beautiful visuals of relatively mundane things? I DON'T GET SCARED AT MOVIES. THIS MOVIE SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME. If you haven't seen this movie, go get in line, and buy a ticket. It's worth every penny. !!!MAJOR SPOILERS!!! One of the best things about this movie is the way it shows how events affect and reverberate within a family. Parents: It shows how children ARE watching your every move.  They understand and absorb far more than you tell them, AND when you wish to keep something hidden, their little antennea extend that much further. This is all under the surface however, as Shyamalan bucks movie conventions by NOT hammering us over the head with his message. He's to smart for that and he doesn't insult our intelligence as an audience.Let's get this out of the way. This movie has an alien invasion in it. The film may even borrow from 'War of the Worlds' or others of the genre. But the similarities end in the pitch. Rather, it's about a man's loss of faith, of hope. Ultimately it's about the pressure that loss has on his family. It's about the redemption that is only a leap of faith away for the most hardened atheist. Actually, that isn't strictly true. It's the relationship between a father (God) and his estranged son (Man).  M. Night could have slacked off and made a candy coated version. Most directors faced with profit concerns and annoying producers would have had to. He is far too serious an artist to do that. Let's face it...he makes his movies on one level for the many to enjoy and then he makes them on another level for smart people. He creates a tone and stays with it throughout the film. His subtlety isn't reminiscent of early Spielberg (as some have alluded) but more like Hitchcock. The title music could have been written by Lalo Schifrin. I haven't felt such an emotional connection with a main character since 'Vertigo'. Far too many films are made where one cares little about the fate of the characters, primarily because the characters fit some cookie-cutter role designed for 'stars'. The realistic use of humor in strange situations threw some reviewers for a loop. Perhaps they are more comfortable with a 'tongue-in cheek' Tommy Lee Jones one-liner during a completely unbelievable conflict with aliens in 'MIB'. That's unfortunate. The humor in this film is the humor of everyday life, the peculiar and amusing incongruencies of people and human interaction.

Munich," Munich: a good film a weak political statement
","I can safely say that Munich is a well crafted film. Spielberg presents a sobering and serious character study of a man given a grisly and dangerous assignment. The film itself is engrossing, beautifully shot and believable. Eric Bana, with a simply perfect reaction to hearing his baby daughter speak on the phone, establishes himself as a heavyweight actor.That being said, Munich is a highly manipulative film. Spielberg makes clear by his emphasis on and juxtaposition of certain elements that his contention is that to respond in an 'old testament' fashion to terrorism is pointless and merely continues the 'cycle of violence'.This logic is seriously flawed if you put it to the test. First of all, there is no moral equivalence between a terrorist act and violent action against terrorists. Terrorism is the deliberate targeting of civilians and non-combatants to create fear among the general populace to manipulate the political landscape. Terrorism is cowardly, reprehensible and the last refuge of the ignorant and incompetent.The 'cycle of violence' argument is weak. If a thug punches some lady and takes her purse, is the cop that forcefully arrests said thug perpetuating a 'cycle of violence'? Of course not. Spielberg's other contention in the film is beautiful and noble. It is stated by the character Robert played by Mathieu Kassovitz. He states that all the years of suffering and persecution that the Jews have gone through has made them righteous and that they shouldn't 'lower' themselves to the level of their enemies.I believe that only someone like Spielberg who was born and raised in America and who has lived in relative safety, affluence and luxury his entire life could actually believe in the impractical course of 'inaction' that he espouses.I also have a problem with the depiction of the cold, methodical methods used by the Israeli hit-men, particularly when the film goes so far to paint the Palestinian terrorists almost as innocent victims of circumstance. In the movie, the Palestinians who slaughtered the Israeli athletes are shown sympathetically as if there actions are simply responses to forces greater than themselves. They shoot in confusion and desperation, while the Israelis are portrayed as calculating and reasoning.If this was not merely my perception but a goal of the filmmaker then there is really an inherent racism in the film. It depicts the Palestinian terrorists almost as sub-human, which is really a cop-out and downplays the cruelty and heinous nature of their crimes.As a film, 'Munich' is of high quality. As a political statement it is disingenuous and naive. I would only recommend this film to those who have an informed sense of history. Specifically, research the history of the Levant and the Six-Day War.",6,0,3,30 January 2006

They would have blown him away immediately at the crime scene and removed any evidence of their M.O. or later outside the restaurant they would not have let him slip away that easily. Pacino's scene with Tone Loc is almost embarrassing. The situation with Pacino and his girlfriend and her daughter could have been more interesting.",7,0,1,2 June 2002

Unfortunately, weak side stories and little character development hamper any true involvement by the audience.This is not to say that it's not entertaining. The classic idea of a small force of free men defeating an enormous overwhelming opponent is stirring and inspiring especially because it is based on true events.The over-the-top nature of the graphic novel comes through in a clear fashion with big screen visuals and 5.1 audio that lives up to the source material.Thermopylae was one of the first examples of independent city-states banding together to face a totalitarian foe. Certainly worth making a movie about.",7,3,9,19 March 2007
Sin City," laughably bad, 'Plan 9' bad, how do movies like this get made?
","You take an intriguing concept (a hard boiled noirish graphic novel) and some fantastic visuals and throw in some big names (Willis, Alba, Elijah Wood) and what do you get? A great big piece of junk! First off, anyone who claims to have enjoyed this film is lying through their teeth. It's one of those situations in which the critics are too scared to pan it because it's 'different' and they don't want to be seen as passe.The acting is over-the-top bad, the dialogue is corny and the delivery is pathetic. Powers Boothe, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen? Come on! Can you have a LAMER cast? Owen couldn't even act in those BMW shorts.I would laud the visuals and cinematography but the storyboards were done by a legendary artist. All you have to do is translate the beautiful Frank Miller panels into a world of motion and your're done. Oh, you might want to get some decent actors and freshen the corny script up a bit.The lack of understanding of what good film-noir is (by all involved) is truly mind boggling. The anti-hero of film noir is neither a superhuman comic book hero nor a sociopathic sicko. A true anti-hero of film noir is a flawed, vulnerable, tough as nails reflection of an everyman. He makes decisions based on reason and logic.This film is inept on almost all levels including sub par editing, directing, acting, and writing.Without any sense of realism, there is no grittiness or real pain. The lame adolescent attempts at humor only accentuate this. Instead of having the stones to go completely over the top a la early Peter Jackson or Sam Raimi we get something Ed Wood might have made in the era of CG. Instead of a tribute to the graphic novel what we get is a slickly repackaged 'Dick Tracy' meets 'Dark City'.",1,11,25,5 April 2005
Gangs of New York," Stunning, Amazing and superbly crafted history
","OK so I'm lame, I finally made it to the theater to see this film.I was amazed. Scorcese pulls few punches in this historical epic. Daniel Day Lewis gave a truly Oscar worthy performance. I could almost imagine Scorcese wishing he could cast a younger Robert DeNiro (but even he would not have improved on DDL's work)While I was watching the film I found myself thinking that, were I a history teacher,  this film would be required viewing for my students. Of course, without historical perspective, it would be a confusing mess. I had the fortune of just finishing John C. Waugh's excellent 'Reelecting Lincoln: The Battle for the 1864 Presidency'. {I recommend this book to anyone interested in our nation and the Civil War.}  This film takes place in 1864. So I was chock full of historical perspective. I nearly found myself giddy.
When the character Horace Greeley was mentioned I knew what his views were on Lincoln, the Civil War, the Irish and slavery. I felt like I was almost 'in' on this film. Scorcese rightly avoids the Hollywood trap of trying to simply blame the situation on one people, one party or one ethnic group. Instead, he has more than enough blame and scorn to cast about so all are equally stung. This reflects the reality of that historical period.  Let's talk about DiCaprio. I was astonished how good he was in 'Catch Me If You Can'. This film kicks it up a notch to use the parlance of our times. He was very, very good and I feel  he was snubbed by the Academy.
Cameron Diaz. When I first saw her gorgeous face on the screen, I thought 'There goes my suspension of disbelief.' In a movie where few people looked attractive at least to modern jaded eyes, she was radiant. I have to be honest. She gave her best performance to date in this film and it was one she can be proud of. John C. Reilly was his usual excellent self. Brendan Gleeson and Liam Neeson were superb in small but important roles. Jim Broadbent was so damn good I forgot he was acting and just thought of him as William 'Boss' Tweed. But even with all these star performances, Scorcese is the real star of the show. He manages to bring real emotion to scenes with rhythm and composition and musical choices.  He successfully pulls off with scenes that I just don't see other directors even attempting. If you haven't seen it yet (and I think I must be the last) hurry and catch it on the big screen. Take it from me you'll be glad you did.",9,0,0,2 March 2003
Braveheart," A truly Magnificent and Epic motion picture
","Top notch in all categories, Braveheart is a level above most films. Themes of love, death, freedom, regret, self-sacrifice and manhood are addressed in this masterwork. I was so surprised (and thankful)that the Academy recognized this movie with it's highest award that at the time, I nearly fell off my seat! The cinematography by John Toll, the music by James Horner and the direction and acting by Mel Gibson couldn't be any better. Beyond being a great 'movie', the true story of William Wallace upon which the film is based is also incredibly moving. It's possible to see our distant relatives fighting in this cause or similar ones.",10,1,2,1 February 2003
The Social Network," Clever but not as intelligent as it wants to be.
","This film is well crafted, well written and better than most movies you will see this year. That being said, it relies on speed of delivery rather than content to dazzle. Facebook, Myspace, Google, Microsoft, Apple, social networking, and the internet in general are all phenomenon that we are currently experiencing. We don't yet know the results or effects. This movie is ambitious in that it is trying to comment 'on the fly' as it were. While it's attempt to be topical is admirable, a movie is still a movie. It needs a protagonist and we are certainly not sympathetic to Eisenberg's Zuckerberg. Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield) is truly the one character the audience can relate to and sympathize with. The real chronicle of the times is that social networking (facebook, myspace) tried to replace the social strata that exists in reality, but simply ended up imitating it.",6,0,1,26 March 2011
The Pursuit of Happyness," Inspiring performance from Will Smith
","I admire passion. It's the courage to live with all that you have. Will Smith has it and the character he portrays in this film has it. I love an inspiring story. I particularly love a story where the main character must overcome realistic set-backs and obstacles that were too difficult for others.I had a wise old teacher who liked to say that 'Life is a testing place not a resting place.' I think Will Smith, because of his upbringing, understands this better than most Hollywood actors. This comes through in his exceptional performance here. I love how Smith's character never loses his essential decency.The film hearkens back to an era of film where story and acting are emphasized over flash and style. The early 80's 'graininess' of the film stock is intentional and not distracting.I recommend this film.",10,3,6,4 January 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Good, hard-boiled espionage flick
","This film was well done. It told the story without pandering to the short attention spans of many of today's moviegoers. I liked it's gritty feel and serious tone. This is closer to how the early Bond films were than the world-saving, special-effects laden epics starring Pierce Brosnan.
     Damon is believable as a desperate, yet ruthless expert. A  killer who is rightly feared for his skills and seen as a threat. I also liked the upper level office politics within Langley. It's nice to show that these operatives are acting according to a policy sent down from above.   
The editing was good with lots of  quick cuts and hand-held/steadicam work was compelling. I always love a good fight scene and this film has one with an explosive conclusion. I liked it better than the first film simply because the character was established (at least in our minds) and we we could simply watch as he reacts and moves through the story.",7,0,1,1 August 2004
