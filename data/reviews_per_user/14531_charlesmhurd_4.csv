It," It just kinda sucked
","Not great movie. No tension, characters were not well enough fleshed out, penny wise was not really scary. I wouldn't say it's that bad, it just kinda sucked.",4,0,4,28 July 2019
Get Out," Fun Movie, Great Time
","This movie is really really really fun. And theres nothing wrong with a movie being pure fun, but also having a funny social message.I think it broke ground with being a unique plot, but overall it was just a fun movie to watch and a good time.I left the theatre with a smile on my face and laughed my ass off during the funny scenes.",10,1,5,8 September 2019
Midsommar," This movie is Genius, but many people aren't ready for it
","I see many negative comments coming from people who don't really understand the film. That is ok. They can have their IT chapter 2's.We are living in a new golden age of horror. But like with most great films, the public will criticize it because they are not ready for it.This movie is simply ahead of its time, and some people can see it. Others won't see it, but that's ok. They will go down in history as the same people who bashed: The Shining, Psycho, Fight Club, The thing, Vertigo and other groundbreaking films that many were not yet ready for.Ari Aster will continue to make films and continue to break ground.",10,18,31,5 September 2019
Midsommar," Most People Won't Understand This Movie
","This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It does something that no other film has seen before.This movie is beautiful, hilarious, disturbing and comforting at the same time.When the shining came out it was critically panned. I am not cautious at all to say this movie is one of the greats and can be comparable to the shining. Most people go into horror looking for cheap scares or a date movie. This is not a movie, this is an experience.If you haven't seen it go right away, this movie will age like a fine wine. And the people who don't understand it will be in the same camp of oldies who didn't like the shining, verdigo, and the thing. Often, the greater population of the United States does not understand great art.Not to be condescending or pretensions, but to see so many bad reviews someone needs to speak the truth.",10,3,11,16 July 2019
