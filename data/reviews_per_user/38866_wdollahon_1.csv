Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Worth Every Star
","I was leaving the theater and overheard a guy behind me telling his girlfriend...'Wow, that was really funny, but it was really insulting. I'm so glad I'm not 'Kazacky,' I'd be really insulted.' And that comment speaks volumes about this film. If you don't 'get it,' I'm so sorry because it's the funniest damn movie in many years- maybe the funniest one I've ever seen. To belabor the humor is to take away from it.I'd call Sacha Baron Cohen the 'new Chaplin,' but I think I would have had to have lived in Chaplin's times to have laughed this hard at Chaplin.Thanks Borat.",10,3,15,6 November 2006
