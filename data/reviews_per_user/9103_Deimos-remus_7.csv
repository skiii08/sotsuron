The Perks of Being a Wallflower," First World Problems: The Movie
","First world problems of rich suburban kids: The Movie. Or basically, a feature-length episode of Degrassi.This movie is filled with such whiny, pretentious, self-righteous, self-pity wallowing, predictable, teenage melodrama, that is so falsely attributed to be 'deep' and 'on point' that it's just plain hard to take seriously in any stretch of the word. It's also an enigma; it's a film that many teenagers pretend to identify with, even though its view of typical teenage American life is so hollow, vacuous and falsified...not to mention, very exploitative of real insecurities that teenagers feel, which are only used as superficial character 'defining' traits, never to be elaborated on, to gain audience sympathy. It also only touches on teenagers that live in wealthy suburban areas, making for a very narrow field of their target demographic to represent. It comes across as so insincere and manipulative that it's actually rather infuriating and insufferable.",1,31,67,13 July 2016
Green Room," White Knuckle filmmaking at its best
","First off, want to say R.I.P Anton Yelchin. Such a tragedy for someone so young and promising to pass. He was incredible in this, I felt he was really coming into his own as an actor. --- After watching Saulnier's excellent and understated Blue Ruin, the director immediately became one to watch out for. A director that knows how to direct characters with subtlety and nuance, but with intensity and brutality as well. Green Room is perhaps the most stressed out I've ever been watching a film, and if I'm not clear, that's actually a good thing. Few films ever get such a visceral reaction out of me, but Green Room managed to do that, and then some, delivering on many fronts as a contender for my favorite film of the year. Since the beginning of the year, A24 has been unstoppable, putting out some of the most unique and incredible genre movies to be released in quite some time.Green Room is certainly violent and grim. Its sense of dread and brutality is unending and relentless, yet never overstays its welcome or becomes cartoonish or fetishistic. It could've very easily gone into Saw, Hostel or Martyrs territory, letting the bloodshed become the most memorable aspect of the experience, but it did something much more. Not only does the brutality feel real and impactful, unlike the aforementioned films, the characters feel totally believable and genuine, completely immersed in their roles. The protagonists are naive and brash, yet fresh and relatable delinquents. The antagonists are subdued, quiet and strategic, yet animalistic and complex. From a character standpoint, it is such a welcome and ultimately more human change of pace.For a movie so steeped in violence, it's a very humanistic movie, filled with rich and complex characters that feel like they're apart of something completely real and also very intimate and small-scale. The story is not a black and white 'good vs evil' kind of thing, all characters have their own shortcomings and sympathetic sides, making for an incredibly dynamic cast. It's a debilitatingly horrifying film, yet done with the same amount of care and understatement as Blue Ruin. It's a white knuckle thrillfest, and one that pits a lump in your stomach from the intensity witnessed on screen.",10,117,180,12 July 2016
The Conjuring 2," High-hopes sequel that does not live up to its potential
","::This review may contain potential minor spoilers, but no blatant and major giveaways::The first Conjuring was something of a very nice surprise for me. I'm not one to usually buy into major release Horror films, but heard so many good things about it from audiences and critics alike that I caved in. What I didn't expect was that it ended up being a very solid and very traditionally done ghost story, with effective character development and slow burn buildup. It had its moments of cheap jump-scares and gags here and there, but overall it was surprisingly effective. Jump forward to the sequel, and there's problems from the start. To parrot its predecessor, the film opens with a previous case of the Warrens (this time the infamous Amityville haunting). Though the Annabelle sequence from the first film felt a bit contrived, it was still effective, it didn't run away with the 'cliche creepy doll' thing too much and the sequence was creepy, despite being relatively mundane. The Amityville sequence thrusts the viewer into a jump-scare filled climax right off the bat, leading the way for the inconsistently toned and paced remainder of the film. The immediate next gripe was setting the scene for London. Using the Clash's London Calling, along with kiddies calling each other that word that starts with 'W' and rhymes with Tanker (a word that apparently makes IMDb's prohibited word list) made the viewer very well aware that the film takes place in jolly old England. I don't think I could've come up with more painfully obvious and groan-worthy (not to mention clich√© and distilled) references to English culture if I tried. Already, the movie was off to a bit of a rocky start, but I gave it a chance. I really did. So from here, I will point out some of the things the film did do right. The performances are all handled well, and the kids are particularly strong in their roles. Wilson and Fermiga are once again, a believable on-screen couple. The strong eerie atmosphere from the first film is back and better than before, as the camera compositions and movements are much more dynamic and interesting. The entities in the Conjuring 2 are a bit of a mixed bag however. On one hand, the old man in the chair is appropriately subdued and fairly nuanced, but then you have a demonic nun, that while creepy enough, has a design that feels old and tried, and felt as though it was trying too hard. Lastly, you got the Crooked Man, which while rather cool looking I must admit, felt pretty out-of-place within the grounded reality the narrative set up thus far, contributing to the film's already inconsistent nature. For a dark horror movie, The Conjuring 2 also felt unnaturally sappy and saccharine. While some moments of levity among the scares and foreboding terror are more than welcome, much of the dialogue reeked of forced sentimentality and hammy cheese, ultimately taking me out of the horror of it all. So, to recap, the Conjuring 2 is far from being a bad film. It outperforms its predecessor in some ways, but falls very low in others. Its tonal inconsistencies make for a very odd structure, yet one that is still rather predictable. It still looks very good, and delivers on some chilling moments, but isn't nearly as effective as the first in this ever-growing franchise.",1,1,2,12 July 2016
2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick was an unparalleled visionary genius.
","Many people say that the Sci-Fi film genre would not be where it is today without 2001...Those people couldn't be more right.2001:A Space Odyssey is among a select few sci-fi films I can deem as perfect. Kubrick brings his A-game with his dazzling level of artistry, because I got to say, this is a gorgeous film. Like those select few sci-fis, there's only a select group of movies I can return to with every viewing with a sense of newfound awe, and 2001 is at the forefront of that group.That being said, 2001 is definitely not for everyone. It's a very slow-burn, and while I like movies like that, others won't and herald it as boring. I have to disagree of course, but I can see how it can be considered tedious to sit through. The story is great and cryptic, but where 2001 really shines is its visuals, which are undeniably fantastic, a fact that can't be disagreed with.Also, unlike many novel to film dramatizations, 2001 is pretty accurate to the source material and is enhanced by it.",10,1,2,13 December 2013
Avatar," Does hype alone make a movie?
","James Cameron's last movie was the big hit of the decade. The Titanic held the record for highest box office, swept all of the major award ceremonies and is regarded by many as one of the best films ever made. With Cameron being the director of such great sci-fi films as Terminator, T2 and Aliens, his newest project Avatar seemed like a great idea.So what do you get after waiting almost a decade since Titanic? One of the most unoriginal, overtly preachy and flashy movies ever made. As many before have put, it's very accurate to just call it a 4 hour long Pocahontas in Space. Almost 10 years of development went into a plot that's already been done to death in every shape and form? Of course, on the side you have to add all of the anti-military, anti-capitalist, and environmentalist angles, and mix in some 'war for oil' elements. Not to mention the whole 'humans suck' schtick, which he already delved a bit into with his previous work, The Abyss. Cameron's anti-capitalist views seem so ironic to me, especially considering that two of his films have grossed the most money of all time, and he's planning on rereleasing them both.Lame story aside, I even thought the special effects were cheesy. All I can say is that completely CGI characters and worlds will never match up to the animatronics detailed sets of previous movies. When I first heard about the movie, I was quite excited, since I had become a fan of Cameron's previous sci-fi works. When the first trailer came out, I was very disappointed. All of the aliens were too saturated in color, making them stand out like a sore thumb, and the creatures looked like the creatures in the recent star Wars movies, which for the record, means terrible. Even beyond the bland CG, the designs were all rather uninspired. The main aliens are just really tall blue humanoids with cat-like faces. All of the beasts are more or less fusions of two different earth animals.I think the reason this movie has such a high rating and big following is because of all the hype that surrounded its release. When everyone is so excited about Cameron making a new movie, I'm sure they don't don't notice the horribly unoriginal plot. People wanted this movie to be great, since they had to wait for it so long, and were willing to pass it off as great no matter what. As for me, after having to put up with all of the non-stop hype and discussion about the movie, I wanted it to be bad. And despite watching the movie with an open mind, I wasn't disappointed.",3,3,6,20 June 2011
The Witch," The horror movie the masses don't deserve
","The Witch, much like films like Kubrick's The Shining or Polanski's Rosemary's Baby just makes the viewer feel uneasy and nerved right from the start. A slow-burning, subtle and reserved experience that lets you resonate with the characters and really experience the unraveling of their family unit. What really makes this film special is that there's so many things that it could've very easily done wrong, but handled every aspect with class, tact and respect. The term 'Scary' means something different for everybody, so deeming this film as 'un-scary' does not mean a thing, I will say though that this film goes beyond just 'being scary', it's not that kind of film. It's much more unsettling and unnerving, getting under your skin rather than being overtly frightening or gory. Frights last a moment, but the ability to not only get under you skin, but linger there is a mark of a truly great horror film. It's a story about losing faith, it's a story about guilt and how those things can tear a family apart. For those wanting a 'fire and brimstone' monster feature, you'll be sorely disappointed. This film is much more in the vein of masters like Stanley Kubrick, Ingmar Bergman with even a touch of Andrei Tarkovsky. It's amazingly and intimately well crafted and shot, scored, acted and researched. It takes its time to tell the characters' stories, but does so with a strange, otherworldly and totally supernatural feel. It's just as effective as an intense drama as it is a horror film. This is the kind of horror film that will be discussed for years to come, and only comes around once in a blue moon. I don't want to give away anything in this review, but I will say this: For those that really enjoy the art of film, storytelling, character building and the craft in general, believe the hype. It's excellent. But for those expecting a gory and fun, cartoonishly-satanist and jump-scare littered monster flick, stay away and don't ruin it for the others trying to enjoy their theater-going experience. You'll end up not enjoying it or will find it to be a tedious and boring watch. Even though at a trim 90 minutes, if you find it boring, you have no attention span whatsoever, but that's besides the point. To cap it off, this is the kind of Horror film I'm always waiting for, especially considering the droves of wanton garbage that flood the theaters week after week, and after looking forward to the film for nearly a year and a half, I'm glad to say that it delivered on all fronts. It's as flawless of a film as you can get, and for this to be Eggers' debut feature, he's in for a hell of a career.",10,13,27,20 February 2016
The Deer Hunter," Very tedious.
","I borrowed this DVD from the library . I had pretty high expectations, considering all of the rave reviews, it being heralded as one of the best war movies of all time, and the fact that it won some Oscar awards. Instead I was treated to seeing a 3 and a half hour long melodrama, where every single scene was dragged out as long as possible.I know that this film was more about the effect war had on soldiers, their friends and family, as opposed to being in combat, like most other war films, which is why most of the film took place at the home front, rather than on the battlefield. The film was basically divided into 3 parts. The first focused on the main characters, and their relationships, and should have been dedicated to developing the characters, but instead you have to endure watching over an hour and a half of people dancing at a wedding. I constantly found myself fast-forwarding through scenes like these. Another example of this tedious style, is the scene where the guys are driving down the highway, and they pretend to ditch one of their friends. You then have to watch the car drive off way out in to the distance, turn around to come back, only to start it all over again, 2 or 3 times. Moving on to the Vietnam war, this film makes you think that the whole war experience is about playing Russian Roulette. Flashing forward, De Niro's character comes back from the war for a short period of time, only to go back to try and find his two friends, and you're forced to believe that Walken's character has been surviving for who know how long, playing Russian Roulette in a fighting ring.What I find extremely funny about the high status the film has, is the fact the film's director, Cimino, was universally panned for his film, 'Heaven's Gate', which is directed in the exact same dragged out style. I'm just glad I didn't have waste any money to watch this film, however, my time wasted will never be refunded.",5,37,70,26 July 2010
