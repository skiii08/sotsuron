Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Bor...bor....Borat.....nooooooo boring!!!
","No, I do not care that it is rude (I am Dutch, so we're used to that). But it did not make me laugh much either; one can expect this 'humour' not to be sophisticated, but my God, this sort is extremely juvenile.....So I found this movie overall pretty boring....What I did like was the role of the guy that played Azamat Bagatov. Very daring for an actor to go this far in a scene like the one in the hotel room... Yes, he shows guts!Please bring me something better next time Sacha Baron Cohen .... Maybe your character Bruno, the homosexual fashion designer from AustriaÂ… Even after this disappointment; I am looking forward to that.",3,4,8,12 December 2006
