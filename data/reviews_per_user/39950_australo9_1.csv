Marie Antoinette," A break from the Norm
","It seems that there was a vast difference between what people expected to see in this film and the actual end product. After reading various books on Marie Antionette, I myself did wonder how Coppola would portray her. I am an avid watcher of Historical dramas and have to say that the originality of this one was incredibly refreshing. Believe me, the film is so much better if you have read the history, as in most cases some situations are more factual than others but the idea behind the film which was to portray Marie Antionette's journey from her betrothal to the King of France to the start of the revolution is achieved very well. Im not a huge fan of Kirsten Dunst but was pleasantly surprised at how she made the part her own, Coppola's films will never be mainstream, despite what happened to Lost in Translation. The costumes were fantastic and the soundtrack (which I, at first was slightly worried about) is excellent and quite strangely fits well into the film. I can see why the French might not have liked it but it was about time that a more real look of Marie Antionettes character and influences was portrayed on film.",8,3,8,13 April 2007
