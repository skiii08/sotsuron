Walk the Line," Superb Portrayal of the Man in Black
","Johnny Cash is, without question, a legend. One of the greatest singers and certainly the greatest Country and Western singer. Based on his autobiographies, this film takes us from Johnny Cash's humble and tough origins, the son of a poor farming family, neglected by his father, with a beloved brother who died when they were still children, to his superstar status, depicting both his passions for music and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) and his self-destructive appetite for drink and drugs.While the film takes on the typical structure of musical biopics, it is saved by superb performances from Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon, who deservedly won an Oscar for her role. The two actors did their own singing and playing and sound perfectly convincing. The film is well-made and hugely entertaining with, of course, plenty of great music. This is brilliant, and a must-see for fans of Johnny Cash, or Country Music (of which I am one).",8,1,2,26 March 2006
Alien 3," Deeply Flawed but Vastly Underrated
","This film is probably the most controversial of the four 'Alien' films.  At the time of it's release most critics and audiences hated it.  Possibly because they expected more of the violent 'Platoon'-in-space action of James Cameron's 'Aliens'.  However, just as James Cameron made his own film instead of just copying Ridley Scott's original 'Alien', so first-time feature film director David Fincher made his own film here.  This film is bleak, dark, depressing and gritty.  The film opens with series regular Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) landing on the prison planet Fiornia in an escape pod.  The landing, incidentally, kills off the other survivors of the previous film (which came in for a lot of criticism).  However, Ripley has brought with her one of the aliens, which quickly impregnates a dog (in the theatrical version, or an ox in the extended assembly cut of the film).The film is set mostly in a dirty, grim refinery, which doubles as a prison. Everyone is bald (the characters have to shave their heads because of lice) and there are no guns.  The film is a very brave attempt to do something different with a hugely successful franchise.  Its main flaw is that there isn't really a satisfactory explanation of how the alien eggs got on board the space-ship at the beginning.Everything is a couple of shades darker in this film.  Ripley is a much bleaker character this time around.  Her entire life has been taken from her by the aliens.  The acting is very good in this film.  Charles S Dutton (as the prisoner's spiritual leader) and Charles Dance (as the prison doctor with a very shady past) are especially good..",Null,0,4,31 May 2004
Requiem for a Dream," Shocking
","The theme of this film is summed up very neatly by it's title.  The characters in it are all looking for ways to escape their lives.  For Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) and his friends (Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans) it's heroin that provides the escape, and for Harry's mother, Sarah (Ellen Burstyn), it's television and diet pills.  Darren Aronofsky directs this adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel with a dazzling, breathless style.  It's especially effective in the disturbing hallucination scenes.  The acting is never less than excellent.  Ellen Burstyn in particular gives a superb performance, and her monologue in the kitchen to Leto, is heartbreaking and memorable. This is a very powerful film and one that will remain with the viewer long after the credits have rolled.",Null,0,1,13 July 2003
Minority Report," Intriguing Plot, Flawed Movie
","This film is almost a follow-up to Steven Spielberg's 'AI: Artificial Intelligence', released a year after this film.  Both are attempts at more intellectual 'adult' science-fiction.Adapted from a short story by Philip K Dick, 'Minority Report' takes place in Washington DC in the year 2054, where the murder rate has been reduced to zero thanks to an experimental division of the police force, which utilises three 'pre-cogs' (individuals who have a powerful ability to see into the future).  This means that murderers are arrested before they commit their crimes.  The head of this division (Tom Cruise) believes it to be perfect, until he is accused of a future murder.Steven Spielberg is a hugely talented film-maker, but this film suffers from his main flaw, which is mainly an excess of sentiment.  The future on display is intriguing and well-designed.  The entire movie is shot in an interesting style which bleaches out vibrant colours from the image.  This accentuates the dark tone of most of the story.  Tom Cruise's character is a deeply flawed individual (he has never recovered from the disappearance of his son, and he takes drugs), but Cruise never really manages to get into the depths of the character.Although the film sounds like an action-packed thriller, in actual fact, a few spectacular sequences aside, it's mostly very dialogue driven.",Null,1,2,1 June 2004
Gravity," Spectacular Space Movie
","This is one of the most spectacular science-fiction movies that I have ever seen.The story revolves around Mission Specialist Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), on her first space shuttle mission, and veteran astronaut Matthew Kowalski(George Clooney) who are performing repairs on a space telescope when they are struck by debris from a destroyed satellite. The views of the Earth from space and the spacecraft themselves are stunningly beautiful and Sandra Bullock gives a fine performance in the central role.This is a film that you see less for the story and more for the experience of it, so it is definitely best to see it on the biggest screen available and in 3-D if possible (I don't even like 3-D much as a rule, but in this case it really adds so much to the experience).",8,4,7,14 November 2013
Monster," Superb Acting, Interesting Movie
","I have to say that I know nothing of the real life details of the Aileen Wuornos case (which inspired this film) so I'm just going to deal with the film itself and not talk about how accurate or not it is.The film tells the story of Aileen Wuornos (played by Charlize Theron) and her girlfriend, Selby Wall (Christina Ricci).  Wuornos comes from a hideous background of violence and abuse and now works as a prostitute.  After she kills a client who tries to rape her, Wuornos goes on the run with Selby, killing and robbing to support themselves.The film is shot in a gritty style, mostly on location.  It's not really a conventional serial killer thriller.  The police investigation is only barely touched upon.  The viewer is with Wuornos and Selby for the whole time.Charlize Theron is totally unrecognizable under heavy make-up as Wuornos. She turns in a truly superb performance and thoroughly merited her Oscar for her performance in this film.  Christina Ricci is also excellent as the sweet but bratty Selby.  While the viewer doesn't come to like Wuornos, in the film, it's hard not to feel some sympathy for her, as much as we may hate her crimes. 
The main flaw of the film is the focus is always on Wuornos and Selby.  A bit more balance would have been good, particularly towards the victims.Worth watching though.  'Friday the 13th' fans may like to look out for a brief appearance by Kane Hodder (who played Jason, in a number of those films).",Null,0,1,7 April 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Acceptable Re-Make of Horror Classic
","POSSIBLE SPOILERThis film will undoubtedly be judged against the classic 1979 George Romero original.  This is a bit unfair as they are both quite distinctive films. The basic plot is the same with human survivors of a world plagued by flesh eating, walking dead, holing themselves up inside a shopping mall.The special effects have certainly improved in this one, and the all-important gore is present and plentiful.  This film is very stylishly made and quite impressive to look at.  The battle scenes with the zombies are well-done with an interesting gritty, jerky look.The main problems are the character development is pretty weak, and sometimes feels just thrust in for the sake of it, rather than to flesh out the story.  There are many characters which do really stupid things here for inexplicable reasons.  Also it lacks the social subtext that Romero included in the original.By the way, do not leave when the end credits start rolling, or you will miss some pretty good scenes.",Null,0,0,19 March 2004
Alien: Resurrection," Save the Worst Till Last
","It's a real pity.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a great director.  Anyone who enjoys science-fiction  and fantasy films should check out his 'Delicatessen' and 'The City of Lost Children' and 'Amelie' was one of the truly great films of the last few years.  However he fell flat with his only (so far) foray into big-budget Hollywood film-making.'Alien Resurrection' opens with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) being cloned by scientists interested in cloning the aliens.  The scientists also have a large cargo of aliens on their spaceship and a ship full of mercenaries arrive with a cargo of alien-impregnated humans.  I think you can probably guess what happens.This film is basically just a tongue-in-cheek action film.  It's fast, action-packed and exciting, with some good special effects, but the film's jokey tone just doesn't work.  It's a pity because I'd have thought that Jean-Pierre Jeunet's surreal and twisted imagination could have turned out a great 'Alien' film.  Sadly, it was not too be.",Null,0,1,31 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Probably the Best Movie Ever Based on a Theme-Park Ride
","This film, which was based on a popular theme-park ride at Disneyland, came out about four years ago now and was really not expected to do very well. However it managed to become one of the major box-office hits of 2003.Set, presumably sometime in the 18th Century, the film depicts the Caribbean port town of Port Royal attacked by pirates, who kidnap the daughter (Keira Knightley) of the town's governor. Of course, the local apprentice blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) determines to save her with the help of flamboyant pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp).The film mixes action, adventure and fantasy into a very entertaining whole. The film is very well-made with some superb special effects and production design, it's also fairly well-acted especially Johnny Depp successfully blending ridiculousness and heroism as Captain Jack Sparrow. it manages to balance the humour and action pretty well, for the most part, although the film is at times overlong.",8,0,3,26 May 2007
12 Angry Men," Best Courtroom Drama Ever Made
","The concept behind this film is so simple and yet it is brilliant. Set almost entirely in one New York jury room on the hottest day of the year as twelve jury members discuss the case of an 18 year old man accused of murdering his father. A guilty verdict would mean the death penalty. On the face of it, the case seems simple and eleven of the jurors vote 'guilty' but one man (Henry Fonda) dissents and tries to talk his fellow jurors around. The events of the film take place in real time and as the film progresses more and more of the characters of the individual jurors and their individual prejudices are revealed.This film provides gripping drama, brilliantly scripted (from a television play by Reginaled Rose) and performed by a brilliant cast. This is justifiably a classic of cinema, much more than a legal thriller it is also an exploration of individual morality (witness the casualness with which some of the jurors are ready to condemn a man to his death). If you have any interest in American cinema, superb acting or just want a great piece of entertainment, don't miss this!",10,0,1,31 January 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Competently-Made Environmental Disaster Movie
","In this film, the world's weather goes haywire, causing tornados, massive tidal waves, giant hail stones and sub-zero temperatures around the world. The film is made up of four storylines:  The main ones deal with a scientist (Dennis Quaid) who knows what is going on and is trying to persuade the authorities to act, and his son (played by Jake Gyllenhaal)who is stuck in the New York Public Library amidst fatally low temperatures.  The other storylines see a hospital doctor (and the scientist's wife) (Sela Ward) try to evacuate a sick child and another scientist (Ian Holm) working in a remote climate research station in the Scottish Highlands.The film is well-made with some spectacular special effects, however it does feel stretched out (at two hours) and it is difficult to sympathise with some of the characters (some of whom seem very cliched) partly due to the switching between storylines.  Also the climate change seems to occur in an absurdly short space of time (I realise this was necessary to make the film at all dramatic, but still..)It's alright though, and it is pretty entertaining with quite an important environmental message.",Null,0,0,2 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Conclusion to One of the Greatest Sagas in Film History
","I have to admit that I am biased when it comes to this film. This was one of the first films that I ever saw at the cinema, back when I was five. For a long time it was my favourite of the 'Star Wars' films, mainly because of the vast array of great creatures in it.The film continues almost directly from 'Empire Strikes Back', as the evil Galactic Empire are building an even more powerful Death Star battle station, the heroes try to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from the slug-like gangster Jabba the Hutt.The film is fast and exciting and the pace never lets up. The special effects are superb and there are some great action sequences. The film is also at the end, genuinely moving. It's not a flawless film though, the Ewoks (spear carrying teddy bears) have always been criticised as a blatant merchandising gimmick, but they're not that bad, and I thought they were great when I was five. Also the acting is pretty poor in places, but that's par for the course with these films.I've lost count of how many times I have seen this films, but I still find it as exciting and fun today as I ever did, and that's the hallmark of a lasting film. Also it features Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) in that famous gold bikini which is no doubt indelibly imprinted on the brains of 20- to 30-something men everywhere.",10,0,0,21 May 2005
Battleship Potemkin," Crucial Part of Film History
","Sergei Eisenstein's 'The Battleship Potemkin' is one of the most important works in film history. Set in 1905 it tells of a mutiny aboard a Russian naval vessel. It is very obviously propaganda but it has a genuine power, which can partly be due to Eisenstein's theories on film editing (or 'montage') and partly due to the mastery with which the large cast is directed. The most startling sequence is the justifiably famous Odessa Steps massacre sequence, which has been referenced many times since. Here, if nowhere else in the film we see a master film-maker on top form. Admittedly the film is often slow at times at the story-line is quite simplistic, as I said earlier the film is propaganda. The action may also seem quite slow by contemporary standards, but don't be put off. It is a film which I would recommend to anyone with a serious interest in cinema.",Null,1,4,19 September 2004
The Grapes of Wrath," A Classic Film of a Classic Novel
","John Steinbeck's 1939 novel 'The Grapes of Wrath' is widely considered one of the greatest American novels, and this film is often considered one of the finest films from one of the greatest American directors, John Ford.Following the plight of the Joad family as they leave their home in Oklahoma during the Great Depression and join the westward pilgrimage of so many itinerant workers to California in search of work.Henry Fonda turns in a flawless performance as Tom Joad and the film is beautifully photographed and directed, but what really sets it apart is the genuine heart that the film has in depicting the struggle of the Joads as they try to maintain their dignity in an unforgiving world.This film is truly timeless in that many people today are still living in similar conditions.",10,3,6,26 March 2006
The Aviator," A Striking and Ambitious Saga
","This film is about the world famous multi-millionaire Howard Hughes. However, if the only thing you know about Hughes was that he was a recluse who secreted himself inside his hotel in Las Vegas and was obsessed with cleanliness, you may be in for a surprise. The film deals with Hughes' life before all that.After a brief prologue showing Hughes as a child with his mother advising him on cleanliness, we move forward to 1927 with an adult Hughes (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) directing his hugely risky film 'Hell's Angels'. 'The Aviator' takes in Hughes' film-making achievements, his romances with some of the most beautiful women of the day (including Katherine Hepburn (a superb Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale)) and his passion for aviation. The picture of Howard Hughes that emerges from the film is of a brilliant man who was a ruthless perfectionist, constantly risking ruin and even death for his goals. This all makes his eventual fate all the more sad.The film is brilliantly made, the cast are all very good in their roles (especially, as mentioned earlier, Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn) and despite lasting almost three hours, it is never dull. The main flaw, however, is that you never learn much about Hughes. Some more on his background would certainly have been welcome.Any film by Scorsese, however, is worth seeing and this is no exception.",7,60,84,14 January 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," Good Remake
","The original 'Hills Have Eyes' (1977) is often fondly remembered as a gruesome and disturbing film, when it actually isn't really. It was actually passed in Britain with comparatively few cuts for the time, and for a lot of British viewers was, for a long time, the only really 'horrific' horror movie available, however Alexandre Aja's remake makes up for that by including all the buckets of blood that audiences might have missed form the original.Sticking closely to the original storyline of an all-American family stranded in the desert and being attacked by depraved cannibal mutants, created from nuclear bomb testing decades earlier, the film nevertheless is far more intense than the original. Although it does suffer from the glossy look common to most modern horror films, instead of the bleak, rough low-budget appearance of the original.Another change is the added emphasis on the background of the attackers, which does add something of another dimension to the film, making them slightly more sympathetic.Worth watching for horror fans, and a must-see for fans of the original. This is a decent horror film, but ultimately nothing special.Contians swearing and graphic violence.",6,0,0,1 April 2006
Van Helsing," Good Fun, If You're in the Right Mood
","I have to say that I am a big fan of 'Dracula' and 'Frankenstein' and all those other classic monsters.  I've seen a lot of the old 1930s Universal films and I've read the original novels.  Apart from some of the character names, 'Van Helsing' has absolutely nothing to do with the original books, or those old movies (although they are cleverly referenced at the start).In contrast to 'Dracula''s Abraham Van Helsing, an elderly professor, here we have Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), kind of a cross between Indiana Jones and James Bond on a mission to rid the world of evil monsters. Summoned by his employers, a secret Vatican organisation, to Transylvania, Van Helsing soon finds himself doing battle with Dracula, his three vampire brides, the Wolf-Man and Frankenstein's Monster.   The acting is wooden, the script is awful and the plot inconsistancies mount up, but this film is still a lot of fun!  The special effects are great, the action scenes are impressive, the three vampire women are beautiful and there are a few laughs.It's just a loud, fast, dumb action film, and providing you accept that going in you can have a lot of fun.    Personally, I enjoyed it.  I thought it was great fun.",Null,0,1,2 June 2004
Collateral," Entertaining and Tense

Both Jamie Foxx (as the innocent cabbie Max) and Tom Cruise (playing against type as the ruthless hit-man Vincent) are very good and play off each other very well in the taxi cab face-offs.The film has a very similar feel to director Michael Mann's earlier film 'Heat'. It's main flaws lie in some of the fairly obvious twists and coincidences in the plot. Still, that being said, it is a sleek, stylish and often very entertaining thriller.",Null,0,0,22 September 2004
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spider-Man Swings Again
","Okay, well, going in I really had my doubts about this movie. I had enjoyed the previous Sam Raimi/ Tobey Maguire/ Kirsten Dust 'Spider-Man' films (even the largely maligned 'Spider-Man 3' (2007) was not without it's appeal) and I felt it was pretty redundant to retell Spidey's origins just ten years after they were depicted in the massively successful 'Spider-Man' (2002).However, I was pleasantly surprised. The origin story, while it covers all the familiar bases (nerdy teenager Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is bitten by a genetically modified spider and develops super-powers, his beloved Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) is shot in a street robbery convincing Peter to become a super-hero, he develops his powers by trial and error and eventually assumes his Spider-man identity), is dealt with in more detail than in the previous film version and it is different enough so that it still feels fresh. The film's principal villain, Doctor Curt Connors (aka The Lizard) is well portrayed by Rhys Ifans and Emma Stone makes for an engaging love interest, even if she is not really given enough to do. Andrew Garfield is great as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, giving a lanky agility to the role. His Peter Parker is much less of a nerd than Tobey Maguire's version, and feels closer to the character in the comic-books.The special effects are pretty impressive and it all looks great in 3D and IMAX.",7,2,5,8 July 2012
Aliens," Great Science-Fiction Action!
","I've been a big fan of the 'Alien' series for many year.  I even enjoyed the much-derided 'Alien 3' and 'Alien Resurrection'.  This has to be the best of the series to date, though.  In this film director James Cameron does what he does best - hard-edged science-fiction action with great special effects.Set 57 years after 'Alien', series heroine Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) accompanies a platoon of space marines to planet LV-426 (where the original alien was found) to investigate the loss of contact with an Earth colony that has been established there.  No prizes for guessing what has happened to them.There is more of everything in this film, compared to the first:  More aliens, more firepower, more humans to be preyed on.  As a result, 'Aliens' is not actually as scary as 'Alien', but then it isn't really supposed to be scary.  This is a war movie in space.For a film that's nearly twenty years old, it has aged suprisingly well. Some of the aliens do occasionally look like men in costumes, and Paul Reiser's villainous yuppie is very 1980s, but otherwise it still looks great.  The Alien Queen is one of the highlights of the 'Alien' series.",Null,0,0,16 May 2004

The film quickly sketches the personalities of the main characters, and when the action starts it quickly moves into high gear. It successfully mixes tension and action in a way that few war movies have yet matched.The performances are great, particularly co-producer Stanley Baker as the hard-as-nails Lieutenant Chard who assumes command on the strength of his seniority, and Michael Caine, in his first major starring role, as the aristocratic Lieutenant Bromhead, who comes into conflict with Chard.Refreshingly, the film is respectful in it's portrayal of the Zulus as honourable and dignified warriors.The script features plenty of memorable dialogue and a decent amount of humour. It also features some stirring music from John Barry.",8,10,10,7 July 2012

Before long he realises that he is not alone, because the city is teeming with people infected by the virus, which is transmitted through blood and saliva.The film, which is shot on Digital Video, has almost a documentary look, and also makes for some impressive camera movements.

Drive," Dark, hypnotic thriller
","This is a film that pretty much screams 'cult movie'. It tells the story of a mechanic / movie stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver. Soon his quiet, ordered life is thrown into chaos when he is pitted against the mob to protect his neighbour and her young son.This is a quiet sedate film, that ratchets up to full gear with sudden, shocking bursts of violence, accompanied by a pulsating electronic score. Ryan Gosling turns in an iconic performance as the mysterious unnamed Driver, although Carey Mulligan is kind of wasted in her role as the struggling young mother. The style of the film harms back to the neon drenched 1980s action films, but the story-line harks back even further, and can be seen as an updating and relocation of the classic Western with Ryan Gosling as the Clint Eastwood Man With No Name.Some viewers may be put off by the slow pace of much of the film, and the graphic violence, but if you are willing to go along with it, it's a striking experience.",8,1,1,9 October 2016
Million Dollar Baby," Powerful and Deeply Affecting Film
","For a long time, boxing has provided a rich source of material for the movies but this, the most recent film from Clint Eastwood, has to rank among the best.Eastwood plays Frank Dunn, a small-time boxing manager and gym owner and Morgan Freeman plays Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris, an ex-boxer, blinded in one eye during a fight, who works in the gym. The two men are friends and they both feel their glory days have been and gone. Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald, a 30-something waitress who wants to be a boxer as a way of escaping her daily tedium and poverty.The film, like all good sports movies, is about much more than the game. 'Million Dollar Baby' is about people who have seen their dreams vanish and those who are starting to find them. Brilliantly made, with the slow, elegiacal tone of the film frequently punctuated by vicious, bruising boxing scenes, and superbly performed by three great actors at their best. While the film may seem at times a little overlong and slow, this is a very small criticism. It's really powerful stuff with some great performances.",Null,1,2,15 January 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Moving, Surreal and Powerful

The film's world is realistic, without any of the hi-tech you might think of from a science-fiction film, but then this isn't really about the science-fiction elements.The acting is superb, especially from Jim Carrey who plays a very shy, retiring person and gives his character a great deal of subtlety.Most of all this is a beautiful, genuinely moving film about love with all it's pain and heartache and all it's wonder and magic too.",Null,0,1,7 October 2004
Psycho," Among the Most Influential Films of All Time
","This film has to rank as probably one of the most influential films ever made. It's one of those films that is referenced constantly. By the way, this is a film where the less you know about it beforehand, the more powerful it is. In fact in the original advertising, Hitchcock asked viewers not to reveal the film's shocks to their friends afterwards, and also that viewers had to be seated from the beginning of the film (when 'Psycho' was released people were in the habit of walking into movies at any point). As a result, i will try my best not to give too much away.Based on a fairly good thriller by Robert Bloch, inspired by the life and crimes of real-life serial killer Ed Gein, this movie constantly unsettles the viewer. Hitchcock knew about suspense and he knew how to manipulate an audience which he does here brilliantly. Almost everything in this film is pitch perfect and the shocks are still striking. The actors, especially the brilliant Anthony Perkins, are all superb. Special note has to be taken of the famous score by Bernard Herrmann.Whether or not you're a horror movie fan, this is a must-see.",10,5,9,16 January 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," One of the Best of the Series
","This really is the film that 'Star Wars' fans have been waiting for, and really writer/director George Lucas set himself an impossible task. For one thing, everyone knows how it's going to end, and there have been years of fan speculation and hype to live up to. Happily, Lucas has succeeded. This film is great and genuinely powerful as it charts the descent of Annakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) to the Dark Side of the Force and becoming Darth Vader. The film opens with a truly spectacular space battle between the Republic and a rebel droid army, which is full of the excitement and spectacle of the old 'Star Wars' films, before the story takes a darker turn as the powerful and sinister Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) starts to gain an unhealthy influence on young Jedi Annakin. The film shows the downfall of an essentially good person. Annakin wants to do good, in particular protect his pregnant lover Padme (Natalie Portman).This film is by far the darkest of the saga, and that is no bad thing. Lucas has outdone himself with this one. The film contains spectacular effects and is genuinely moving. A fitting conclusion to the greatest film series of all time.",10,4,11,21 May 2005

Trainspotting," The Greatest British Movie of All Time
","This film became almost a cultural phenomenon as soon as it was released in Britain in February 1996.Adapted from the first (and best) book by Irvine Welsh, the film shows the lives of a group of Edinburgh heroin addicts.The film is a black comedy, at times hilarious, tragic, surreal, brutal and uplifting.  The film is full of memorable moments such as the chase down Edinburgh's Princes Street which opens the film (I happened to be there when they were filming that scene) and Ewan McGregor diving down the 'Worst Toilet in Scotland' headfirst.The film doesn't condemn drug addicts, but it is probably more effective then any amount of preachy moralising as it depicts the devastating consequences that can happen to drug users.  The film is well acted by a cast who have (mostly) become pretty famous since.  Especially memorable is Robert Carlyle as the violent Begbie.I have seen this film many times.  It is an instant classic.  Go check it out.",Null,280,347,28 February 2004

However, things take a sinister turn when he comes to believe he has witnessed a murder. With the help of his glamorous socialite girlfriend (Grace Kelly), Jeffries becomes determined to unravel the truth.Technically the film is an spectacular achievement with the entire film, more or less, taking place in the cramped confines of Jeffries' living room, all we see of the neighbours are what he sees, each of them playing their own little dramas, with the windows acting like miniature screens. The acting is superb, especially from Stewart as the trapped voyeur and Kelly is perfect as his girlfriend. They are helped by great support from Thelma Ritter, as Jeffries' cynical nurse and Raymond Burr, as a sinister neighbour. The script is clever and witty and the whole production is brilliantly directed by Hitchcock.",10,0,3,23 May 2007

It's hard not to detect at least an element of wish fulfillment in this tale of a lonely, Elvis-obsessed comic-book shop clerk who finds love with a beautiful call-girl.While not among his best, the script by Tarantino still amuses with plenty of his usual banter about movies, comics and other aspects of popular culture.  The direction, by Tony Scott is slick and flashy, and the parts are well-played by a great cast (Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt. Samuel L Jackson and Christopher Walken are among the great actors with cameos in this film).One of the main problems of the film is that it is very derivative (particularly of the 1973 Terrence Malick film 'Badlands' and 'Bonnie and Clyde').  Having said that, 'True Romance' is still a very entertaining film (although be warned:  the violence is pretty strong).",Null,1,2,17 February 2004
The Godfather," One of the Greatest Films of All-Time
","This film has to be one of the greatest films ever made.  Based on the best-selling novel by Mario Puzo, the film tells the story of the Corleone family (who also happen to run a large organised crime syndicate in new York).  The film has some remarkable performances.  Marlon Brando appears in one of his most memorable roles as the aging family patriarch Don Vito Corleone (the 'godfather' of the title) and Al Pacino makes a powerful impression as his youngest son, Michael (in the role that made him a star).  James Caan and John Cazale are both brilliant as Michael's brothers (Caan the volatile Sonny and Cazale the weak Fredo).The film is beautifully photographed, with a great feeling for the textures of light and shadow.The score by Nino Rota is superb.More than just an action-packed gangster thriller, this film is also a complex family drama.Both the quiet family and business scenes and the explosive action are well handled by director and co-screenwriter Coppola.",Null,1,4,15 August 2004
