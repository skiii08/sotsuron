Resident Evil: Afterlife," A big let down
","Firstly, the 3D was absolutely terrible. I walked out of the cinema thinking something was wrong with my eyes, but according to the rest of the reviewers on this website it IS fuzzy! Very bad job, I found myself watching half of it without the glasses.The acting, plot and script were all abysmal. The plot holes in this film are ridiculous, you'll find yourself attempting to piece together parts of the story whilst the movie races from scene to scene.The characters are lifeless and boring. I was only interested in Milla, for all the obvious reasons. Even so, I found Jovovich to be less than impressive. I enjoyed the first three movies but Resident Evil: Afterlife is no match for its predecessors.To sum it up: It's a slow-mo pumped, plot less bore fest. HARDLY ANY ZOMBIE ACTION!",4,2,4,21 October 2010
