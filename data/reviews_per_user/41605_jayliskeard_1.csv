Walk the Line," A Great Biography and Love Story
","We have just seen this movie as a family and it was a nice change from all the other movies out there right now. It is mixed with a great story and great music. Both Phoenix and Witherspoon had stellar performances. Whether you like rock and roll; country or rockabilly this movie leaves you with a great soundtrack. It's been a very long time that we went to a movie and when it was over - the audience clapped. If you are going to treat yourself to a movie, go and see this one. You will not be disappointed. This movie had a great supporting cast as well, I am no Gene Shallot, but I do know what I like. This movie will re-introduce a whole new generation to the Man In Black - Mr. Johnny Cash. Do not hesitate to go and see this movie.",9,2,4,18 November 2005
