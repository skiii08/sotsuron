Iron Man 3," The best part of this movie was the trailer...
","I don't think I have ever been as disappointed with a film as I was with this one. Talk about an epic failure on all fronts. The plot was a disjointed mess, and it appears the filmmakers involved took all of the things that worked in the previous Marvel Universe films and threw them out. From watching the trailer, I felt this was a sure fire winner. However, the trailer is about as good as it got and the story contained in the film was nothing like what was advertised. Cringe inducing comedy, bad direction, and poorly thought out plot choices can only lead to an extremely underwhelming and disappointing third effort in the Iron Man franchise. I hope this stands as a fluke and doesn't foreshadow what's to come with the rest of Marvel's Phase 2. If so, let me off on the next stop. I'd need a lobotomy to survive the hours of torture they would have in store for me.",3,3,7,4 May 2013
