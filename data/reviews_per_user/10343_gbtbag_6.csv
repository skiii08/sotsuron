Marie Antoinette," The Film Marie Antoinette Would Have Made About Herself
","This film is so vacuous and self-indulgent, the friend who accompanied me to the screening remarked that this is exactly the film Marie-Antoinette would have made about herself.Sofia Coppola's own life of privilege is so transparently on screen in every frame here, I don't know why she just didn't turn a camera on her rich, bored, indulged movie-making friends.Like many people who enjoyed 'Lost In Translation,' I was looking forward to this. The fact that Judy Davis, my favorite living actress, is in it helped. But what a waste.I guess Judy needs to work like everyone else, and this is the kind of high profile project that keeps her profile high among the Tinseltown movers and shakers who won't be honest with Sofia Coppola about what a turkey she's made.All the PR guff about the costumes and the production design made on a limited budget. If you want to see beautiful images in a movie which cost a buck ninety-nine, rent Sally Potter's 'Orlando.' Each image is like a tableau in that film.But don't waste your money on this one.",2,27,52,18 September 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Wildly Overrated, Mildly Amusing Comedy
","Are we really so deprived of decent entertainment that this movie is getting rave reviews which, quite frankly, it doesn't deserve.At best, it's mildly amusing, but I was expecting so much more, based on the reviews I've read and user comments on this board.Yes, it has an underlying sweetness, but it could have done with some judicious editing. What is funny the first or second time really isn't THAT funny the fourth and fifth time, such as the old Indian guy talking dirty. A good illustration is the end title sequence--it's funny to see the cast perform 'Aquarius/Let The Sun Shine In' from 'Hair' for 30 seconds but did we really need to see the whole thing as a music video? One thing that really bothers me about Steve Carell, both in this movie and in 'The Office,' is that he is way too buff to be playing these kinds of characters. Guys like this don't have 'bods.' I'm really surprised that his agent hasn't told him that his physical condition is totally at odds with the personalities of the types of roles he's playing.If I really want to laugh, I'll tune into 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' reruns on HBO each weeknight.",5,8,16,31 August 2005
Big Fish," A Much Better Movie Than Reviews Imply
","I was gladdened to read the many positive reviews of this movie on imdb. Based on the reviews, I was expecting a disappointing Tim Burton effort which gets bogged down in the Billy Crudup/Albert Finney sequences.But this was one of my favorite films of the year.  It's absolutely magical and very, very touching.  I have a feeling that it will be reevaluated at a later date--possibly as soon as the video release--as an underappreciated masterpiece.Albert Finney deserves an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor. He is so devilish and charming, and very funny.   I'd also got the impression from reviews that Jessica Lange is underutilized by Burton but, in fact, she has a large, featured role in which she doesn't put a foot wrong.  If anything, she's underutilized by filmmakers in general in that she doesn't appear in many movies these days, sad to say. She's a wonderful actress and the relationship between her and Albert Finney's character is very moving.I loved this film and highly recommend it.  Sometimes I wonder i the so-called 'serious' reviewers don't just base their reviews on other writers' opinions.  They got it very wrong this time.",Null,0,0,2 January 2004
Avatar," Astonishingly Bad
","I am gob-smacked that serious film critics have gone ga-ga over this mess. The only reason I didn't walk out was I knew there was a big punch-up coming at the end which would pull out all the stops.I haven't seen any of the big films which have been screened in 3-D before this one. The scenes in the forest with all the flora and fauna get the most benefit from being filmed in 3-D. But I saw more effective 3- D when I was a kid, or at an Imax screening before Imax started showing regular films in addition to its scientific ones.At no point during 'Avatar' did I duck reflexively--which is what's great about 3-D because you think a ball is going to hit you, or a car is hurtling towards you. This looked more like a moving version of a diorama or a 3-D card or photo printed on rutted plastic-coated cardboard.The script was terrible--a vomit-inducing blend of faux scientific gobbledegook and new age, airy-fairy nonsense. That bizarre merging of the characters with animals and each other via their braids (don't ask!) was sexual but in a very, very creepy way,I can't wait for the idiots who start learning the made up language in time for the next ComicCon or the first 'Avatar' convention.Head over to the nearest Home Depot and start working on those tails!",1,43,99,21 December 2009
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Chris Columbus Lives Down to his Reputation
","When Chris Columbus was announced as the director of the Harry Potter movie adaptations, my heart sank.  It was bad enough when Steven Spielberg--another horribly superficial director--was going to do them, but Chris Columbus?!Somehow, Columbus and Steve Kloves, the writer, have managed to totally miss what made the Harry Potter books so appealing. Very little of their charm and none of their wit survived the transition to the big screen.It must have taken a Herculean effort by Columbus and Kloves to drain this wonderfully imaginative book of every ounce of what made it magical.There is no sense at all of what makes Harry so special.  Part of the fault for this major shortcoming rests with the kid playing Harry. He is not a novice performer but nevertheless can't act. Cast members such as Fiona Shaw, the great Irish stage actress, was given ONE speech as Harry's aunt.  And what about the gloriously expressive Julie Walters?  Reduced to little more than a walk on part.Regardless of the size of their roles in the sequel, they were underused in this first movie.  And John Cleese was horrible.  I hope he's sitting back in Santa Barbara home and laughing at how much he got paid for phoning in this embarrassing performance.Was  that really Alan Rickman mugging and overacting as Professor Snape or Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails?  I love Maggie Smith but she's too old for Professor McGonagall.As the writer, Kloves must also shoulder some of the responsibility.  But Columbus is the real culprit here.  Like Spielberg, Penny Marshall and Ron Howard, Chris Columbus does not trust his audience.He feels he must telegraph every emotion and manipulate us with innumerable reaction shots and, even worse, John Williams' horribly overblown music.   Can Williams please do us a favor and stop writing film scores and concentrate on the Boston Pops?  He doesn't know the meaning of the word 'subtle.'The constant cutting away to reaction shots--of awe and wonder-- were beyond irritating.   And surely Hagrid has enough personality without Kloves having to give him his own special catchphrase ('I shouldn't have said that')  to repeat and repeat and repeat ad infinitum?As a fan of the books, for me this film was disastrous.  It is upsetting to think something that means a lot to so many people was summarily handed over to someone with the depth of a piece of tissue paper.By trying to please everyone, Columbus, Kloves, the producers and Warner Bros. have really ended up pleasing no-one--except perhaps J.K. Rowling's bank manager.Harry Potter fans would have been better served by a multi-part, high class TV adaptation than this mess.",Null,0,0,27 November 2001
Pitch Perfect 2," If you liked 'Pitch Perfect,' Don't Waste Your Time
","I wish I'd never seen this. It sullied my memory of 'Pitch Perfect', which I loved. I wish I could grab back the two hours I wasted watching this turkey. 'The Godfather Part 2' it ain't.The only reason I've given it two stars is for a couple of funny lines and the fact that they persuaded all the actors to come back.Elizabeth Banks, who had a small but funny role in the original as one of the contest commentators, apparently decided she wanted to direct the sequel. (As she had the rights to the original book, she can do what she wants.)Never underestimate the ego of an actress or actor. Banks' has pumped up her role and basically sucked the life out of the rest of the film by cutting performances in favor of a ponderous plot (recording studio, weird scene when some guy holds an acapella contest in his house,) and unbelievable 'love story'between Bumper and Fat Amy that wasn't even hinted at in 'PP.' Even the songs that are featured aren't on the same level as those in the original. It's horrible. Don't waste your time. Just remember 'Pitch Perfect' as the perfect little movie it was.",2,13,55,16 May 2015
