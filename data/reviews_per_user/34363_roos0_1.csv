United 93," Excellent and compelling
","I am a European guy who was living and working in the United States (Silicon Valley / San Francisco) when 9/11 happened - fulling intending to stay there and build up a new life. At the time, I was shocked and could not believe what had happened. Neither could any of my coworkers. In the aftermath, all business deals in the Valley came to a grinding halt. I lost my job and was forced to move back to the Netherlands.I saw this movie yesterday at a local theater, and I left shaken and disturbed, and very close to tears. I would recommend this movie to anyone from anywhere -- whether from the United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East or anywhere else for that matter. It provides a gut-wrenching closeup detail into the mindset of the people involved in this drama.",10,2,5,22 July 2006
