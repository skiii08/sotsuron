Changeling," Had me glued to the screen from start to finish...
","I saw this on DVD recently and this was an amazing movie! I wasn't sure what to expect - all I know it was about Angelina's character having a son returned to her which isn't actually hers. When I watched this, I was instantly glued to my TV screen from start to finish, absorbed into this time and this horrific tale of a mother's vow to get her son back.Angelina is fabulous as Christine Collins who is battling the Los Angeles police department and their corruption. She is claiming that they have brought her back the wrong boy when her son is missing, while the police department is trying to defend themselves.It is good to see Angelina take her acting to new levels. She has recently been in too many blockbuster movies such as Tomb Raider, Wanted etc in which she is reigned as the action queen of Hollywood. But in this movie, she shows that she is definitely one who can take on a role as serious as Christine Collins and her desperation to simply get her son back.This story shows the fragility that women feel in this period as they would most likely feel powerless against the men in the police department and how they are seen as insignificant in their own opinions. In a sense, this film is almost like political activism and brings about a change in society through this film. It is even more stunning to know it is based on real events which adds a sense of realism to this film.This is a heart wrenching and emotional story. I have read that a lot of people find this hard to watch, and I do see where they are coming from, as the film does go down some disturbing paths and scenes, but in the end you get a beautiful film with terrific performances. The relationships between the characters is very touching and you really root for Christine Collins in her fight to gain justice not only for herself, but also to other women in the story who have met with some nasty fates due to the police.It had me glued from start to finish and this is definitely one of those movies that sticks with you, simply because you can only imagine what it would have been like back in those days, and how one person's fight can change society.",10,1,4,3 October 2010
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Afterlife only half resurrected...
","OK I didn't see this in 3D so maybe seeing it in 3D would have given the film a bit of an edge. But I judge films based on their plot and entertainment and I can enjoy a film even if it isn't in 3D - I think that it is mainly just an incentive for you to like it even more. In my opinion, if a movie is horrible and its in 3D - it is simply that. A movie that is bad and in 3D.Now afterlife isn't a horrible movie. I enjoyed the first three, in particular the third, which I think the is the best of the three. Afterlife is simply more the same excuse to have big special effects and continue a plot that simply seems will never end with Umbrella continuing on forever in the next 'afterlife'.The monsters in this movie were good, but I think the zombies don't really play much of a part in the horror and are simply there just to add to the atmosphere. Also, I felt that near the end, it borrows too much from the Matrix and is really nothing original.I was also expecting more from the characters who appeared in the third film and they really aren't given much to do. Milla Jovovich is fine in her role but she simply is given the same mission over and over in all the films - save people and get them to safety. Honestly, how many times do you have to see this done in each Resident Evil movie? I'm not saying this isn't entertaining nor is it visually nice, but I think if they keep doing this over and over, it's gonna wear thin pretty soon. I'd wait for the DVD.",6,3,8,25 September 2010
Hereditary," A family on the brink of destruction trapped in a horrorific inevitable nightmare
","I was very nervous to see this movie as I had read all the reviews prior to my viewing of this. Many claimed it to be as scary as The Exorcist and that this film had very disturbing images that would stay with me. I can say that it got half of it right.This isn't a typical horror film that relies on jump scares that you know are coming. The horror really comes from the tragedy of a family that breaks down due to circumstances that occur in their lives. Yet this is what makes it feel real as it could happen to any of us. The feeling of loss, the blame that occurs in tragic events and the process of grieving is all captured. I won't say much about the plot other than Annie (Toni Collette) and her family recently have lost the grandmother of the family. Annie mentions at her funeral that she was a private woman and that there were some conflicts in the family and the relationships were strained. Annie eventually starts to discover more about her grandmother's life which leads to more discoveries than she probably wanted.The performances in the film are terrific overall. Toni Collette portrays all sorts of emotions from anger, devastation, horror and sadness flawlessly. She is her finest in this film and the dinner scene just shows her acting abilities. Really hope she gets an Oscar nomination for this role.The film slowly builds up a sense of dread and despair that doesn't let go at all and it makes you feel uncomfortable. The first hour of the film can feel like it goes quite slow and this may put off some viewers however it really makes you get emotionally invested in the characters. Thus seeing their pain later on makes it that bit more devastating.The ending was a little bit disappointing, maybe not because I saw it coming, maybe because it gives you the answers in a spoon fed way. A bit more subtlety might have worked better.",8,1,2,26 June 2018
Citizen Kane," Outstanding cinema - a story of a man who has it all only to lose it all
","I had to see this film? Why? Because it was hailed as 'one of the greatest films ever' etc etc. Also seeing it in 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I was very eager to check out this film, and not really knowing anything about it.And it is truly a masterpiece. From the first fifteen minutes, I thought I was going to watch a film that was indeed told like a short film shown back in those times, only to be surprised when the audience got out of their seats. The first fifteen minutes is a summary of Charles Foster Kane that shows his life experience and eventually his death.What I had no idea was how many references the cartoon the Simpsons have made to this film - I honestly had no idea it was from this film. Well I'm glad I know now. What is truly gripping about this film is that it starts off with a poor boy who strikes it gold and eventually takes over a newspaper business, and has his soul turned into one of greed and possession; a man that many of the characters in the film who have known him claim him to be a man who is incapable of giving love, but wants to be loved on his own terms.Then you have the mystery of his last dying words 'rosebud' that you discover at the end what this mystery thing is. And it all makes sense that this was something he has treasured and is incapable of getting it back. I'm not going to reveal it but the metaphor is pretty much something many of us may think of later in life.I loved how the story was told - with it's flashbacks and insights into this character from a perspective of each person who knew him. It's almost like a detective sort of story only we aren't looking for crimes, but more rather the crimes he has done to the heart of the people around him, and in turn his own.Finally I am glad to have seen this and to realise why this is hailed as classic. Orwon Welles is just terrific as Kane and gives a performance that will surely be remembered as one of the most magnificent in cinema.",10,1,2,21 April 2011
Oldboy," Totally absorbing...........one of the best films I've seen in a long time
","I watched this film without really knowing anything about it - I just read the IMDb quick summary on what it was about - and seeing it praised so highly and a colleague of mine saying to watch it and it is a must see - I buckled down on it on a Friday night.I was expecting this to be some sort of typical revenge film but with a deep meaning - why would it be rated so highly then? The good thing about the film is that it doesn't give you answers straight away and does a terrific job of keeping you engaged all the way through. You get to know the main character who has gone through years of torment for some unknown reasos as you experience his pain as Oh dae Su (Choi Min Sik) becomes a tormented man in his struggle for vengeance.All I can say is that this film takes you down some paths that you think at one point - 'oh no they really are falling for clichés' but then it goes down something darker and you are totally blown away by what the conclusion is. I am usually a sucker when it comes to finding out twists as I can barely spot them but let me say the twist in this one I did not suspect one bit and was shocked by what I saw.This is a unique film - the acting is perfect, the idea is clever and the emotions portrayed in the characters all exhibit human traits of being torn inside while still alive and just the whacky thing we can do to people to get our peace of mind if only temporarily.All I can say is that you must see this film and it is a film I will be recommending to everyone to see.",10,2,5,28 October 2011
127 Hours," Captures it all pretty well in under two hours for '127 hours'....
","This film in the first five minutes almost feels like it could be potentially be a promo for a Tony Hawk skateboarding short film. What you pretty much sense is that the protagonist seems a bit of a free spirit, plays by his own rules and does things on his own. 127 Hours is a film about survival. That's what you obviously get from the trailer. But it is also a film about the choices we have made in life and how they lead us to a certain situation. When you really look back at all the things you have done, no matter how small, does it lead you to a destined path? There are those people who end up in drastic situations and near death experiences which make them think about life from a different perspective. Then you have those who are given that chance to think about life while playing the waiting game, or if you would rather call it, the holding onto hope game. I'd say 127 Hours is a bit of both. James Franco plays Aaron who gets stuck down below a crevasse with a hard rock and a difficult spot. The focus of the film is on him and once he gets himself into the situation, you know what is going to happen after; getting out. But it is not that simple. You feel the experience he is in, the hopelessness yet determination to not give up. With his trusty camera with him, psychologically he stays alert through filming himself, playing scenarios that almost serve as a light comedy, while also remembering memories of his parents and his ex girlfriend.Danny Boyle made a terrific and moving film with Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours brings us into the fear of being trapped in the middle of nowhere. If any of us was in this situation, would you have the guts to do what Aaron does? Would you give up and admit defeat or is your willingness to live strong enough so that you might appreciate life more afterwards? These are questions only you can answer.The isolation and loneliness are captured perfectly through the eerie yet beautiful cinematography of the landscape in Roobers Roost, Utah. The scene which everyone talks about is of course the cutting off the arm scene. Now, if this scene had absolutely no music, it would not have been a huge ordeal and I could have easily sat through it while sipping a cup of tea. But the music really gives it an edge and it is like it is making you feel the pain at the same time, and while it doesn't last long, it stings, so I can see how audiences have been reacting to this. Seeing the images of Aaron's face with blood and a horrific look on his face was enough to make me feel chills.This is a simple tale of survival, but it is one in which it is real because Aaron is not made out to be a hero or anything; he is simply just a normal man who has a will to live and to fix up the mistakes he has made in his life. The thing I liked about it is that you discover who this man is and it wastes no time in building his character up – the first twenty minutes pretty much gets to the point of where the plot should go. While Aaron is thinking about his life while trapped down there, you contemplate his life with him. You understand that he feels that he got himself down there through his choices in life – it will make sense when you watch it in how he comes to the conclusion that it is his fault due to the fact that he chose to be alone in life. You also understand why he has to cut his arm off, because when given little alternative besides death, there is no choice.It makes you wonder about the people you take for granted in life. Small things such as letting them know we are alright and telling them where we are. Because you never know when there is a time in your life when telling someone what you are doing can change everything for you. It just makes you think about that a little harder, and in this day of age when it is so easy to let people know via a text where we are, why not use it so people can have a peace of mind?",8,0,3,25 March 2011
Cloverfield," Had a pretty good time with this!
","When this movie came out, I knew it was a disaster movie but I had no idea what the disaster was - then my friends told me it is some monster. I thought, OK that sounds original.While you could compare it to something such as godzilla or other monster films, this is quite an intriguing film because the first twenty minutes or so everything seems so normal that you get drawn more into the narrative and then you get the unexpected shaking with an earthquake and a whole lot of other events that are never explained to us the reason for its cause, so the characters are just as confused as us.This is taken with the effect of the shaky cam corder capturing the events, much like the Blair Witch Project and it is highly effective in this case. It has the effect of not being too predictable, you don't know what is going to happen and the atmosphere feels fearful due to this.To explain the plot in the beginning is kind of irrelevant as it is simply just a celebration for a farewell party for a guy who is going to work in Japan. After that, you almost forget the beginning scenes once all the mayhem comes in.As for the monster, the good thing is that they only show bits of it now and then and it isn't until later that you see the full image of it. This is one of those movies where you work things out for yourself and nothing is really explained properly but this is an added bonus to the cam corder approach to film as it feels more authentic as though this could have been something that happened to you, and you simply documented it and have no idea what the hell is going on around you.I guess you can say this has been done before with the cam corder technique, and the characters are simply one dimensional, but this is a survival story so it really isn't necessary.I had a great time with this though it does make me think of something: if you were in these terrible situations, wouldn't you just be inclined to run and let go of your cam corder? I would be more concerned for my personal safety rather than trying to record everything. But I guess you would want to show someone one day what you went through, so I guess it makes sense.",9,0,1,29 April 2011
Silent Hill," It looks great but I was a bit confused
","**** May Contain Slight Spoiler******* I have never played the game and that shouldn't matter. Watching this movie, I found it to be very atmospheric in its sets and tone. I found the town of Silent Hill creepy enough so it had my intrigue.Then the second half seems to go down some sort of weird plot where at first it was about finding a child, then went into this whole weird witch burning and religious cult thing. It sort of lost me there and seemed to get a bit all airy fairy on me.And yes the dialogue was a bit odd at times and silly. I'm still a bit confused so maybe I need to give it a second viewing.I like my horror movies and I did find some moments a little chilling, but the second half just seems to go down.",5,1,1,9 November 2010
Hotel Rwanda," An amazing emotionally drenching film that you can't take your eyes off
","I didn't know much of the genocide that happened at Rwanda though I had heard brief talkings of it so this film was very intriguing for me to watch. What starts out as a man called Paul (played magnificently by Don Cheadle) who has the unfortunate burden of being the protector of hundreds of people who will surely be killed by the opposing party during a civil war. What we see is the conflicts of these characters who are trying to stay alive as the world abandons them.This film is truly gripping from start to finish. It is a very powerful film that makes you care about the characters so much and makes you marvel at the cruelty of humanity. What you see is a man who does not want to get involved in the corrupt politics of his surroundings and just wants to run a nice hotel, but then ultimately becomes the hero to many people in order to save them. You also learn of the selfishness of powerful countries such as America an the UK in how they simply do not see countries such as Rwanda as of any significance for them.The film has terrific performances from everyone, the violence is not as bloody as what I thought it would be but it has a high degree of realism that it becomes violent in your mind and through what you can only imagine is happening in the slaughter. A movie like this can only bring out the compassion in you, and I would find it hard to believe that you would not be moved by this film. Essentially, this is a story that is really nothing new, as it is a movie that you probably can predict it going in a certain way, but you really don't care. You just get swept up in this magnificent tale of a man simply aiming to protect the people of a nation that has gone into turmoil. This is a masterpiece!",10,1,1,12 October 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Beautiful and imaginative.........
","Pan's Labyrinth is a fairytale like no other. It is essentially gripped in reality and submerged in the real world with a sense of horror that brings you back into the real world we live in.What I loved about this story is that you are sort of expecting a typical ending that has most of these sort of fairy tales ending but you get something different (which I won't say here).Our main heroine is Ofelia, a young girl who has moved with her pregnant mother who has married an officer who is hunting out Spanish guirellas during a war. She is a lover of fairy tales and its novels. Disliking her wicked stepfather who is a cruel man blinded by his mission of blood and pride, she encounters a labryinth in which she meets a Faun who says she is the reincarnation of a princess called Moanna. She is given three tasks by the faun to ensure her loyalty and spirit is true so she will be able to return to the world her father - the King - has longly awaited for her to return to.I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched this. I imagined some sort of escapism for this girl as I read the back of the DVD and saw it was set during a war. And I wasn't entirely wrong but at the same time, it is almost a sense of hope for this girl to escape a world that is torn apart by the cruelty of life and the people that inhabit it.The visual effects are superb, and you can't help but be drawn into this world of wonders. I was a bit shocked by the graphic violence in this, so you do wonder which audience this film is going at. But I think it is interesting that a film which seems to have very mature adult themes can incorporate so much magic and wonder at the same time. It really is something to behold.All the performances are fine, in particular from Ivana Baqureo as Ofelia. You really feel for her and the supporting characer of Mecedes really makes you root for her and the whole guerilla group fighting for justice.It's an unusual but highly imaginative story that manages to capture your interest in this dark world mixed with the human spirit to fight for what is right. Highly recommended.",10,2,10,9 October 2010
Shutter Island," Intriguing and captivating despite the fact you can sort of see this coming.....
","This is a film that makes you think in terms of the terror that can invade the mind. This is what I got from this film, but I also got the message of what you can distinguish from reality and delusion. Yeah nothing really original but the story is told in a style that keeps you captivated till the end. I think Di Caprio gives a reasonably good performance - some people are saying it's over the top - maybe towards the end I felt that a bit.I think with the twist - which I won't give away - I could sort of sense that coming halfway. The ending is a bit ambiguous because I am not entirely sure what the truth is, though you do know what happens to Dicaprio's character. The tension that builds up to the climax is done very well so I really enjoyed this movie.I think the whole look of the film has a grainy feel to it which gives you that sense of dread. You know it is going to get somewhere, so you are just waiting for it while having the plot build up to it, so the ending leaves you hanging a bit. I think there is a message to the ending which you will understand, and can also be interpreted as a message about the mental health system and how patients are perceived in their state of mind.Definitely worth a look, but I don't think you should expect something spectacular, but entertaining nevertheless.",8,0,3,19 October 2010
Tangled," Highly enjoyable film that brings back some of Disney's magic
","To be honest I miss the old days of Disney films and computer animation hasn't fully taken me over. Perhaps it is because most of the Disney films I love take rank with Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Aladdin, The Lion King and the Little Mermaid to name some. That is not to say I don't enjoy computer animation but there is a certain quality to them in which the humour feels a bit more in your face, which isn't the humour I usually go for.Tangled takes on the old tale of Rapunzel whom I only remember as a girl locked away in a tower with very long hair. I didn't remember much else of the tale as this is not one I'm highly familiar with in details. So I was surprised to find myself enjoying this and it's been a while that I've been to an animated film that has songs in it again. The songs aren't as great or memorable as Disney's old classics, but they are still enjoyable and Disney has brought back its charm, which has been a long time coming.Rapunzel (voiced by pop start turned actress Mandy Moore) is kidnapped at birth by an old woman who longs to have her youth back. It turns out Rapunzel's hair has a magic that will keep her young and if it is cut, will lose its power. The king and queen, unable to find her, cast out sky lanterns every year on her birthday in the hope that one day she will return. On her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel desperately asks her mother to see the lanterns as her birthday gift, which is flatly refused. Flynn Ryder, who is the leader of a thieving group, steals the tiara of the lost princess and ends up escaping to Rapunzel's tower. After Rapunzel knocks him out with a frying pan, which ends up becoming her weapon of choice throughout the film, she strikes a deal with him. If he can take her to see the lanterns, she will give him back the tiara. Meanwhile, her adopted mother Gothel, who kidnapped her eighteen years ago, tries to get her back home.To change the film title from Rapunzel from Tangled is obviously Disney's cheek at making it seem more humorous because there is a lot of use of Rapunzel's hair. Many escapes from the bad guys involve the use of her hair, whether it be used as a sort of lasso to swing them from one end to another, or being used as a glow in the dark torch while underwater. But hey, this is a Disney film so it's all adorable. Rapunzel is made into a very Americanised girl, but luckily not into a damsel in distress bimbo which would have made her character totally unsympathetic. She is simply a curious girl who has never experienced the world within the four walls she has lived her life in. What is funny about the opening is how casual the introductory voice over is done. Instead of making this a very childlike fairy tale opening, it's almost as though our heartthrob Flynn is taking a humorous approach to the tragic kidnapping of the princess, and for some reason it works probably because you know she will end up being saved later on, just like in other tales such as Sleeping Beauty or Cinderella. There are some very marvellous scenes in this film, one being a boat ride with Flynn and Rapunzel in which all the lanterns are lighted out and lifted into the air around them; it reminded me very much of Airiel and Eric in the Little Mermaid while Sebastian sings the romantic yet humorous 'Kiss the Girl' song. Visually it is just beautiful and amazing to look at. Luckily, the writers bring scenes like this which are moving, and don't get caught up in making too many unnecessary jokes which would have made this more slapstick rather than funny.I will have to say that while I do miss the classic Disney films of the ninety's, Tangled is a welcome gem simply because it brings life to these characters, situations and isn't a girly movie in the sense that the plot isn't about Rapunzel finding a prince; it's about her finding her freedom and exploring the world she has only read about. There is plenty here for guys to like too, with Ryder's daring wit and smooth talking with Rapunzel, they add a lot together than they are without, also add some nicely executed action sequences which makes use of Rapunzel's long hair and you're in for an entertaining ride.The ending, while nice, was a bit too sweet and cliché for me, and considering the cleverness of the film throughout, could have come up with something more cleverer but this is a minor complaint. This is a great film that adults will enjoy as well and is a great comeback for Disney, who have been in the shadows of Pixar's blockbusters. While it may not have that true magic of Disney's original works, it is still a very welcome and entertaining ride nevertheless.",9,2,5,2 April 2011
The Thing," The Thing is a complex creature this thing...
","John Carpenter's The Thing I found very slow to start off with in the beginning and it takes its time in getting to the point of the film. It was lucky it finally got interesting at the half way hour mark because I was starting to wonder exactly what all these guys were doing in the Antarctic.The Thing is a horror movie that relies on sudden shocks and visual effects that take a shape shifter into some bloody but sometimes amusing territories. The title is correct as you don't really know what this Thing is - at first it looks like some really warped spider then the next thing its something else.The characters in this film - to be honest I really couldn't care less about any of them and who died because that is the whole point of the film - to get down to the 'who dunnit' or in this case 'who is it' mystery. And it sometimes gets confusing because you never know who could be it - and it doesn't really explain itself well enough to give you enough clues and hence comes off randomly sometimes.But I will say that it is a fun sort of plot and this 'Thing' is given quite a casual treatment in its entrance. It isn't dramatic but it is a shocker - those poor dogs in particular - and hence builds up suspense quite well and you never know what is going to come around the next corner.It's not really Halloween, but it sure has a thing about it.",7,0,1,2 May 2011
Salt," Suspenseful, slick, daring....Salt delivers the punches
","OK I thought this was simply going to be one of those - 'I've been framed' movies and discovering who is behind this whole set up thing. This is what turned me off from seeing it in the first place, but I was still intrigued, so saw it with a group of friends after celebrating my birthday.What a surprise! This was not only interesting but suspenseful all the way through. The action scenes have been criticised, saying they aren't realistic - for people comparing this to James Bond, come on - you think those scenes are realistic (aka: Die Another Day title wave scene?). This was well directed and I thought the soundtrack added a lot of the tension. In comparison with the Bourne films, well I don't think you can compare it on all levels because essentially they have different plot lines, different motivations and also Bourne is more about discovering who he is. In Salt, Salt knows who she is, but it is up to the audience to find out.What I think we miss nowadays are strong female leads in action roles in which the film has a serious tone, so it is a welcome refresher to see Angelina kick some butt. I mean we already had Matt Damon in the Bourne films, so I thought it was about time we had a woman. It was a wise choice to change the lead role (in which it was originally meant to be a guy with Tom Cruise, thank god it was changed since he probably would have made this really boring!) to a female as it gave it more depth and an added twist.The plot in short: Angelina plays Evelyn Salt, who works for the CIA, then is accused by a Russian defector of being an inside Russian Spy undercover in the US. Of course, Salt doesn't stand for it and ends up on the run, with us wondering exactly who she is.Yeah OK it's not the most original plot line (but what is nowadays) but the way it is handled is terrific, the action scenes are done fast enough to not make you notice the slight flaws and absurdity (which I think adds a lot to it anyway) of it. The truck trailer scene I thought was done spectacularly. Much has been said about the fact that Salt jumps from one truck to another then is able to run at fast speed again - well yeah I can see they sort of made her superwoman but I guess I didn't really notice it too much when I first watched it.I think they should have had a bit more quiet moments throughout the pacing; it pretty much jumps from one action scene to another, with a few flashbacks into her past, though more could have been done with character development. If Jolie weren't to star in this, I don't know which other Hollywood actress could pull this character off and have the same screen appeal to keep the audience rooting for her. There is one thing I am a bit tired of - why keep making Russians the villains? It seems America will never get over this love/hate relationship with them, so for all those Russians out there who watch this movie, well you are forgiven for criticising this movie, and are probably blaming Hollywood for Americans stereotyping them so much.Angelina never looked better as a black haired action heroine, and she definitely delivers. It is definitely a roller coaster ride that kept me intrigued from start to finish. The ending is a bit abrupt and was done for the purpose of a sequel but if the sequel dwelves more into her character, I'm sure it will deliver.",8,2,5,27 September 2010
The Little Mermaid," Loved this film when I was younger and still love it now
","The Little Mermaid is one of those films I grew up with when I was a kid - something that the whole family can watch and never really get sick of. The imagination brought into this fairy tale (despite the fact that the ending is vastly changed from the original to please the kids) is simply superb. Songs, music, characters are all terrific.While I think Beauty and the Beast stands as Disney's best animated film, The Little Mermaid is still one of the top ones to check out. A story about Aeriel - the young mermaid curious about the human world who ends up falling for Prince Eric of the human race.And all the other cute characters such as Sebastian, Flounder, not to mention a very sinister villain with the Sea Witch. It all makes for a great time and has a good deal of emotion in it too.I really miss Disney films made in this era - they were done so well and I will always be a huge fan of them. The ones nowadays - while they aren't horrible, just seem to be a bit too modern and hence don't have that magic as the old ones - probably because they focus more on doing references to other things rather than coming up with original ideas that felt fresh.",9,7,7,1 May 2011
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beautiful, poetic, philosophical.....what more could you want?
","Ang Lee is no ordinary director. He brings out his characters with great emotion and depth that makes you care about the story, plot line and knows how to use subtlety to his advantage.Crouching Tiger is perhaps one of the most beautiful and interesting movies I've ever seen in my life and is definitely in my list of favourite films of all time.The storyline of the film deals with four main central characters who each represent a different sort of perspective on society and situation in life. Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh)is a strong warrior but has had to sacrifice personal love in the face of tradition and honour. Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) is a famous warrior who longs to lead a life of peace but has one more score to settle to avenge his master's death. As the two secretly love each other but remains taboo, they long for a more peaceful life away from the bloodshed.Enter Jen Yu (a stunning Ziyi Zhang) who has a fascination with the martial arts world. A rich bureaucrat who is about to enter an arranged marriage, she longs for a more fascinating lifestyle where she can be free to do as she pleases. However, her view on the world is vastly different from Lien and Mu Bai's. Her extreme fighting capabilities have turned her into a sort of rebellious girl who longs to lead the life she truly wants, especially with a desert bandit she is in love with named Lo (Chang Chen).CTHD deals with not only the world of martial arts but also the emotions of the characters which is a very huge plus in this genre. Sure, you have some conventional plot lines such as avenging a master's death but Ang Lee keeps the focus on the characters. At times, the martial arts aren't the main focus here and it is the character development and the story that you really care about - but it is great that the action scenes are just breathtaking.The performances are terrific. Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat look great together and make the performances very believable. Ziyi Zhang is just stunning and brings a combination of beauty and danger to her role as the feisty young princess. What is terrific about the film is that you really need to invest emotionally with the characters in order to fully understand the meaning of the film. In particular with the ending, if you don't get it then it just means that you didn't feel what the characters went through and the meanings behind their actions. In a lot of ways CTHD is a very spiritual film. It deals with many themes such as repression, freedom, the longing to love and the expectations of a society where the rules don't always fit us. The cinematography I might add is stunningly beautiful and really adds a lot to the film. A lot of the landscape also seems to add a lot of energy into the film and bring some visual imagery as though the landscape itself represents the freedom of the soul, in particular the desert.The action scenes have the characters floating in mid air and flying, walking on water and flying through the trees. To many people this might seem ridiculous but I took this as a dream. This film is essentially a fantasy though the characters feel real. It is just amazing to see these scenes. I am sure that Chinese audiences are already accustomed to such scenes and I have seen some of these things before but the way it is done here is just so elegant and beautiful it just takes your breath away.Ang Lee always has that ability to make you invest emotionally with the characters in the story. He knows that the complex emotions that occur in the story are what is important at the core and heart of a film and that is what makes such great films so memorable. However, CTHD also offers fantastic action as well and is also very romantic at the same time.I can not recommend this film enough. It might not be for everyone but for those who do love it, you will understand exactly what I mean.",10,1,2,30 September 2010
Shrek the Third," They made this very near the expiry date and the smell is near sour..
","I enjoyed the first one immensely and the second one was decent. Shrek the Third however lacks the freshness because there are only too many jokes you can make out of the characters such as Donkey or that Pinnochio puppet.The plot also is a bit thin and to be honest a little lame. Shrek has had to take over as King as his father in law is on his death bed. Then he finds out there is a cousin of Fiona's called Arthur who can take over instead of Shrek having to do the work. Prince Charming also vows for revenge and to get his rightful place on the throne.The storyline is really weak and I honestly didn't really care about the plot because you know it's all gonna turn out happy anyway - it is Shrek after all, not a tragic melodrama that will make kids unhappy. The film borders on being ridiculous at times to plain annoying then to cliché in terms of its ideas. The character of Arhur was alright and was likable and Timberlake does a good voice of him but this is only a small accomplishment in terms of pulling the film's weight together.Dreamworks - you guys have made tons of money off the Shrek franchise - how much more do you want? Oh wait - there is the fourth movie and that Puss in Boots film coming up! Of course you would keep continuing.",4,1,3,28 May 2011
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," I was curious alright and glad it got the better of me..
","This is a film I've been highly curious to see for a while and finally got round to it. I heard it was long and it is long for around 2 hours and 40 minutes but it is a rich story, sympathetic characters and makes you wonder at the preciousness of time and life that we have.Brad Pitt - now I never really saw him as much of an actor but boy has he done a great job here. You forget that he is the tabloid pretty boy everyone keeps talking about. In this, he feels more like a character than ever. Cate Blanchett is superb and the chemistry between the two leads is terrific. It is also interesting to see how they both grow older but in different ways - he becomes physically younger and she gets older.What I think the film is trying to get at is how we all emphasise on the fear of becoming older. But if you did it in reserve - where you start off as an old person and become younger - do you really become younger? You still live out life and go through the journeys that normal people go through. You love, you feel pain, you cry etc. This is made more ironic by the fact that when you are born, you start off being helpless and when you are old, you become fragile just as if you were born as well but with more wisdom.While I think the ending could have touched more on its message, it leaves you to interpret what they are saying here. It's what you take away from the film and the experience of Benjamin with you. And while it could have been a bit more specific with its message, I think if you are highly moved by this film, you will pick up your own moral from this film.Essentially it's almost like a Forest Gump type of film where it's about a man who goes through life's experiences. There isn't really a solid based story here - you could simply dismiss it as a bunch of things that happen to this person, but what makes it meaningful is how the character develops with the realisation that time is short for him just as everyone else, and that is something all of us can relate to.I spent two and a half hours watching this and I certainly don't regret it. This is a film that will either move you or for some, bore you but I wasn't bored. I have more respect for Brad Pitt after seeing this.",9,2,4,13 May 2011
Ip Man," It's a martial arts film with an emphasis on kick ass action scenes....but boy is it enjoyable
","My colleague of mine recommended this film to me and no offence to him, but I was thinking 'hmmmm well I don't know if I really trust his judgement since he probably just likes all action no story'. But he kept telling me about it so I was like 'ok I'll check it out'.And boy am I glad I did. This has a story that also dwelves around history with the Chinese occupation of Japan. But at the heart of the story, the real message is to always remain true to yourself regardless of your circumstances. Donnie Yen playes a martial arts respected master in his community, known as Master Ip. He has a wife and a son and often has tons of challengers who come to fight with him.Sounds boring? Well it definitely isn't. Ip Man may at first look like a cheesy martial arts flick and while it has some of these elements, the character of Ipman is so likable and charismatic played wonderfully by Donnie Yen that you can't help but just respect him like he is some sort of noble wiseman. And the martial arts scenes are choreographed with such precision and excitement that you really just root for Ip man the whole way through.There is also a political message in regards to the occupation of China from the Japanese - the film I wouldn't say doesn't necessarily take sides, though obviously Ip man is the character you feel for and is Chinese so it didn't really bother me - it is based on events after all.All I can say is that I was blown away and the film kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through especially at the end. Ip Man is just a guy who values peace and dignity - he never once boasts or shows off - you just want him as your own master so you can learn some valuable lessons from him.While Crouching Tiger is still my favourite martial arts film, Ip Man is a masterpiece in its genre as well. And why am I even comparing them? They are two different movies in different styles. Just go out and see it - you won't regret it!",10,0,0,12 October 2011
The Graduate," An interesting film and a good comedy
","I was dying to see this film for ages and couldn't seem to find it at my video store no matter how often I went. Well I finally got it from my local library and sat eagerly to watch this.And I'm glad I did! Even though this film is more than forty years old and I'm a 22 year old Gen Y, there is still a lot to relate to in this - the decisions you make when you are at that age and also the decisions you make when you're considerably older. Dustin Hoffman plays a great quirky character with Ben Braddock who has graduated from college and not sure where he wants to go in life, with pressure from his parents and their friends. Then jumps in Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) who takes him down a path of guilt and seduction, who just happens to be his father's business associate's wife.The interesting thing about this film is that this can happen anywhere and probably more nowadays. The bored housewife stuck in a meaningless marriage, out looking for some fun is something you see quite a lot in today's time as well. It must have been even more controversial back in the 60's when the age of innocence was coming to an end. I can only imagine what it was like back then when something done was considered unconventional and highly immoral.Another thing about this movie was its great soundtrack. 'The Sounds of Silence' is a song I wanna hear again and I felt it really added to the feel of the film with the songs played. You really root for Ben as he goes to desperate lengths to find what he wants, especially when Mrs. Robinson's daughter comes into the pack.And also hilarious was the ending scene. I'm not going to spoil it but now I'm so glad I watch the Simpsons because it just makes you laugh when you see how many references that TV show has made to so many classics. And it was even funnier seeing it in this movie - it just made me laugh. It also begs the question of do we follow our desires without looking at the consequences - or should we just face them as they come since no one never really knows what happens when we make certain choices?Perhaps at my present time in life - now knowing exactly what I want to do with my future, you can relate to Ben's character at being lost and confused. I don't know if I would have a fling with an older woman though but you can see how desires and temptations often lead you to do things you never thought you might. I guess it's the whole thing about being young and thinking you need to do everything before it's too late.",9,1,1,9 May 2011
Pride & Prejudice," Jane Austen would surely be disappointed....
","Jane Austen set her stories in a time in which certain rules and conventions were in place during 19th Century England. This is why stories such as Pride and Prejudice are so interesting because you get to see how much time has changed, how societal values and expectations have altered and how we can also compare these values with those of Austen's time.What this version of Pride and Prejudice does is pretty much aim this to a new generation, neglect a lot of the customs of Austen's time and change things to suit a new audience. Something like this cannot be done when the story is also a study of the times of that period.For starters, there were several things that annoyed me.1. When Lizzy is talking to Mr Wickham by herself, she isn't meant to be by herself! The whole town would be talking of that and it was not appropriate for ladies to be seen along with a man, and also she wasn't wearing a hat or anything which was customary.2. When Mr Darcy's sister meets Elizabeth, she was acting more like a thirteen silly teenager modern girl than someone who was meant to be shy and obviously brought up with the right manners of that time. There is no way, I was thinking that Georgiana Darcy would ever act like that in front of a stranger.3. A lot of the plot line felt it was going fast forward. I felt that they didn't really capture the essence of the plot, and were in a rush to get as much out of the way in order to get all the plot elements into it in the running time. This is the problem with adapting a novel such as P & P into a movie, because the little details count just as much as the big ones.********Ending Spoilter*********** 4. The ending was extremely unsatisfying, considering they could have at least put a wedding in it, instead of Elizabeth going to her father and getting his approval. I mean, OK I get that the story isn't about the wedding, and is about Darcy and Elizabeth learning about each other and first impressions etc, but at least give the audience what they would want if you are going to neglect a lot of other things in the movie! I felt that the actors were all going through the motions, simply spitting out their lines with no real feeling. It no way captures the essence that the BBC series managed to do so well, but I will give credit to the filmmakers of this version considering they had less time and a lot to squash in.Lydia's character was so overdone you just wanted to slap her on the face and tell her to shut up. Yes I know she is young and wild, but it was almost like she was on some sort of drug, and you just can't stand her presence.Despite these flaws, there are good points. The production design was quite good, the costumes, scenery and look of the film fits the time of the story. Keira Knightley is good but doesn't hold a candle to Jennifer Ehle. There was a certain lack of sophistication in her performance and because she looks so young, and I know the character is only about 22, there was just something off about it. I guess I am being biased since I love the BBC version, but if you compare this to Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility, you see how you can make a really great adaptation of a classic novel.Give this a miss. For those wanting the true essence of P & P and how Austen would have liked it, then I highly highly recommend the BBC version. Characters are much more developed, they stick true to the novel and they don't try to modernise it.",5,2,4,30 December 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Visually fantastic
","I haven't read the original story, and to be honest I didn't really understand the whole point of the story in the first place. Especially after watching the Disney cartoon, it sort of left me a bit bewildered.However, in this version, I am happy to say it is an enjoyable movie, which looks great visually with some good performances in particular from Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. Mia Wasikowska as Alice is very likable and the fact that she is a lot older in this version (which explains itself later on in the film) and is not so much as a damsel in distress figure makes it more enjoyable to take this journey alongside her.The changes to the original story didn't bother me that much. I thought this was an interesting take on the tale and it actually added a bit more substance to what is a slightly meaningless tale in the beginning anyway. Johnny Depp's character as the Mad Hatter is good, though I liked him better in other movies. But it really is Helena Bonham Carter who lights this up as the villainous queen. She steals the show with her spineless and cold character.I did find the ending battle a bit somewhat anti climatic, but I think it doesn't really matter since this isn't a film about battles and major war (thought it sometimes tries to be) but more about the beauty of a new world and how you can learn things from it, even though it is quite confusing.This made more than a billion at the box office - wow I'm surprised! Not because I think it's a bad film, but I didn't realise this story had such an impact on so many people.This is a much more darker version on this tale, though I don't think it is dark enough to scare young kids, though they may be a little frightened of some scenes. I think adults will also enjoy this, though those looking for a faithful adaptation of the original story will probably have to get used to the new ideas, but it is imaginative nevertheless.Worth to see for the performances and the visuals. Story - hmmm..well it's in my opinion a higher notch above the original story, but nothing majorly spectacular.",7,1,3,7 November 2010
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," A shocking film that might leave some wondering why they sat through it....
","This is not a film you want to ever watch again after the first viewing. The only reason I watched this film was because it was in the '1001 movies you must see before you die' book and I'm trying to see as much of the films it recommends. So after doing some research on this film and hearing people's disgust and horror, but also the film's themes and message, I was very curious to see it. I don't mind being challenged by cinema.And while watching it - this is not a film that will entertain you but more disgust you. The story is simply a horrible fascism power narrative that degrades kidnapped males and females prisoners into doing all sort of sexual degrading acts while also putting them through torture in the end for crimes of wrongdoing. The film is set in the Republic of Salò, Italy in 1944.One particular part has people eating human feces. I read this is meant to be a metaphor of consumer capitalism and the consumption of junk food in our lives. Well McDonalds still gives me some sort of pleasure when I eat it.The heroes of this film are supposedly the captors - the leaders of this horrible prison. And it makes sense because this film tries to expose fascism for what it is and if they only showed this amount on film, I can only imagine what it was actually like in reality. This can happen in all sorts of situations where you have lunatics hungry for power and complete control. So there is a strong message here that I can understand what Pasolini is trying to say here. He was impacted emotionally by such parties back in World War 2 and he is simply trying to show how abuse of power and control only serves those few who have it, while everyone who is 'ordinary people' are considered as not worthy of being treated as gods, but animals.As for the sexual acts that go on, they are degrading for these people so only someone who has pleasure in sadistic acts and enjoys this could derive any sort of pleasure in such viewings. I don't intend to watch this film again and I can't imagine why anyone should want to do so out of pleasure. This is one of those films, such as Hanake's 'Funny Games' that a single viewing is enough to understand the message. To put yourself through it more than once is simply asking for yourself to have a bad feeling in you and as humans, we can only be reminded so much of the cruelties in life.While many will be quick to dismiss this as a horrible piece of work, I think it has a lot to say on the human condition, power and control and the abuse of it.But be warned viewers - this is not a film that you can take in lightly. Be prepared for what you are seeing if you see this and make sure you want to see a film such as this. It most certainly isn't for everyone. This is a film to be viewed on artistic purposes and meaning. If you're looking for a good time or entertainment, this is an instant fail.",8,3,6,18 April 2011
Thor," The God of Thunder impresses but forgets about the development along the way......
","I'll be honest – I wasn't looking forward to this movie. It's not that I thought the plot looked boring or anything but I have honestly had a bit too much of superhero Marvel films. How many more superheroes are there? I think we're gonna have a shortage soon on who can make it to the big screen eventually. So I went into this, having to pay $25 for a seat (I nearly had shock when I heard that was the amount) for 3-D plus V-max seats. And believe it or not, this is the first time I have seen something in 3-D! So I was very excited to get my first taste of it.Thor (played by a very physically fit Chris Hemsworth), who was soon to be crowned King by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is banished to Earth, stripped of his powers and essentially become mortal after his arrogance and hasty decision making cause their enemies the Frost Giants to have bad blood against them again. While on Earth, Jane foster (Natalie Portman) runs into him, along with two of her friends, who are on a mission to explore stars and the galaxy above them.Meanwhile, Thor's brother and underneath the surface rivalry between them, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has some questionable motives. Does he really want to look out for his brother or is he after the throne that has been denied to him for so long? Ten minutes into this film you can already see where the plot will take you and only someone with a blind eye would fail to notice it. It manages to make some believable characters out of this with a good performance from Wensworth, who has come along way from his Home and Away character back in Australia. He is right for the part both in his look and physical appearance and makes it believable. Anthony Hopkins is decent as King Odin but doesn't have as much screen time as I would have liked, considering his character does a vanishing act in the second half. Hiddleston however, felt more like he was meant to be cast in a spaceship movie and overacts in his role.The contrast of the two worlds of Asgard and Earth is an interesting one, though I will be honest in saying the scenes on Earth are nowhere near as fascinating as the scenes in Asgard. With the 3D, it is simply beautiful to look at, in particular the bridge that links the two worlds together. Visually, I was blown away by how good it looked.However, one of the themes of this film they explore in this is the making of a good leader. In the beginning, Thor is arrogant, self centered and proud so his lesson is to learn how to be a better person/leader. This aspect was not developed well, mainly because Thor's time on Earth is more concerned with bringing humour and establishing a very boring and highly unconvincing relationship with Jane, the physicist. Why they cast Natalie Portman into this when any other commendable actress could have done this with such a small role is pretty much for star power to attract more people to the theatre. It's funny when Thor mentions one of his lines 'I miss her' when he is back in Asgard – I was thinking to myself 'how could you miss her? You barely spent ten minutes with this woman and you miss her?' I didn't buy it for a second.For a character like Thor, who is meant to be arrogant and proud, he pretty much snaps out of it quickly on Earth, and not a lot is done to really engage you or convince you that he really has changed for the better. I'm not saying you don't see his manner change, but what really triggers this? I really felt he didn't really learn many lessons with the short time he spent with these humans, and thus the character is underdeveloped when there was so much potential for him to grow.The real plot driver is essentially another family feud in terms of sibling rivalry and is sort of the norm for epics like this. This is where the real story derives from. In terms of the enemies with the Frost Giants, there is a great scene in the beginning where Thor and his army like friends go head on battle with them, then after they become second nature to everything else, hence the enemy is often neglected in the story.The overall wrap up of the film in its conclusion is not cliché and I am glad it avoided going down a path of sentimentality to the extreme where you feel this has been done over and over. However, the end feels a bit rushed considering you are meant to have a great high respect for Thor in what he has been through. And yes, I can see why, but I didn't feel it nor did I want to give him the respect, most likely because I think the writers don't give him as much respect he deserves for what could have turned a good film into a fantastic one.",6,7,19,26 April 2011
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," It's fun, but overall kinda dull........
","This is a film with pretty much a pointless plot that is simply there for two great looking actors and a bunch of action scenes. This is definitely a film that you shouldn't take seriously because it doesn't take itself seriously at all. But that is sort of part of the fun.This is meant to be a romantic comedy action film and it is funny at times, though it didn't make me laugh that much. Angelina's character is more of a tight cow in this film and I actually felt more sympathetic with Brad Pitt's character instead as he actually is more gentlemanlike in this movie.The plot - well it is pretty thin and it is pretty cliché in my opinion. The action scenes are done alright but it is nothing spectacular. This is pretty much Hollywood trying to bring in some big bucks.The chemistry between Angelina and Brad I have to say is pretty good. They really light up the screen and are really charismatic, but that alone isn't really good enough. I found the film a bit silly, sometimes boring and overall I didn't think it was that funny. But the two stars make it worth the whole way through though they do seem a bit flat in their characters which makes it feel more like they are just there for the motions - but then this movie isn't really about character development.Also, I didn't really like how they ended it and I won't say anything here, but they could have done a bit more on the relationship between the two at the end and how things changed for them. It didn't satisfy me at all.",5,0,3,3 November 2010
Die Hard," Very good action film with a believable hero protagonist
","Believe it or not, this is the first time I have watched Die Hard. Yeah it's been on TV tons of times, and I only saw snippets but I sat down and watched the whole thing properly.And what a ride it is! Die Hard takes a simple premise and turns it into a slick action, suspense film. Bruce Willis is perfect as John Mclane who doesn't abide by the rules in order to save a floor of people from getting killed by some captors - led deliciously by Alan Rickman. I don't know if Rickman did a perfect job with the German accent but he is still very effective in his role - mainly because he isn't a stupid character that makes stupid mistakes as in most films of this genre.And it is also Mclane's character that makes you root for him - his cool attitude makes it very easy for you to go along the ride for him. And the other cop in this film who talks to him via walkie talkie represents one of the cops that actually have sense in these situations instead of the usual red tape that makes it harder for people to do their jobs properly.The director keeps the pace of the film steady so you aren't left hanging too long - it knows where it wants to go and it doesn't waste time building up unnecessary melodrama to fill in the gaps - because it wouldn't really work here. This is an action film and one that is done very well and is highly enjoyable from start to finish.",9,1,2,21 April 2011
Amélie," Don't know how you cannot enjoy this delight!
","Amelie is sugary sweet in its approach to life, those around us and the pleasures of things that go around us. For some it might be a bit of an unrealistic view on how life can be but really - who cares? This is a film that focuses on the good things in life, but also touches on the regrets some of us hold dear to us. Plotwise it is essentially a love story - though a weird sort of one that deals more with the chase rather than the ending kiss - and is an adventure of delights waiting to unfold.Audrey Tautou is perfect as the angel faced Amelie who is a somewhat oddball and takes delight in the small things in life - putting her hand in a sack of grain, cracking creme brule or skimming stones on water. She decides to turn people's lives for the better and ends up doing things such as matchmaking her colleague with a broken hearted stalker, punishing the nasty fruit and vegetable store owner for mistreating an employee and at the same time, falls in love with a guy who is almost as weird in her in terms of his pastimes.So what is the main purpose of this character? Quite simply - she is a misfit in society essentially. But she is well liked and pretty, but isn't entirely sure where her life is heading. She is a girl who is not sure about love and is sort of afraid of it, and thus seeks pleasure in making other people happy but forgets about herself.There are a lot of themes in this film and metaphors you can interpret which makes Amelie more than just sweet candy which is why it has mass appeal. It has a lot of humour, good performances and some funny visual effects. But in its essence, it is a film about not holding back in life and looking at all the fine things that life can bring us.Amelie is delight from start to finish. For some it might be a bit too sweet and you think you've overdosed on a lot of lollies but for the two hours it worth, it's well worth it!",10,2,5,9 May 2011
RED," A bit of a letdown but still entertaining......
","When I saw the trailer for this, I actually thought this was quite an interesting idea. I mean, how many movies will you see old actors shooting and kicking ass? And since when was the last time you saw Helen Mirren looking elegant and deadly in one movie? This movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which is why it can be enjoyed as a light comedy. The story is simply - ex CIA agents are being targeted by the CIA in place now, and an old bunch of retirees now have to come out of retirement to work together to take down the bad guys.It's a pretty simple plot and is just an excuse to have action scenes showing the ability of the old to kick ass - but it is enjoyable. I did think some of the scenes almost felt a bit cartoonish, and this is what I picked up on. If it is trying to be a satirical comedy, it excels on some levels and fails in others.The love interest of Sarah (Louise Marie Parker) and Bruce Willis character I felt was really boring and her character was a bit unbelievable. I mean, she is this really ordinary person in the beginning then gets thrown into this world of crime, guns and explosions and is suddenly all for it like that. Her character was almost an annoyance, and was simply there as an added subplot.I thought John Malkovich was pretty good as his character who is the ultimate paranoid retiree thinking everything is out to get him (and has reason to). But what was the joy for me was seeing Helen Mirren with a gun - she would have been one of the last actresses I would have thought would star in action films, but here she proves a delight and charm in her own right. Talk about elegance and deadliness all in one.It is entertaining and maybe I was expecting a little more, so I am disappointed. This is a no brainer essentially, but it is good to see a film celebrating its older actors in a film that is usually associated with young punks killing each other and running away from the cops.",6,4,6,26 October 2010
