The New World," Artistic Without Substance.
","This was basically about the 'true story' of Pocahontas and John Smith. Not your Disney version. Although, I think this is one time I would have preferred the Disney version to whatever sort of artsy drama we would call this. John Smth and Pocahontas meet, they fall in love under bad circumstances, John has to leave, Pochahontas becomes Europeanized and marry's another guy. (They never said this other guy's name OR Pocahontas' name ONCE throughout the whole movie I don't think) Eventually the married couple moves to England where Pocahontas is treated like royalty. John comes to visit her, and they realize that they can never be together. She stays with her husband and son, but soon dies. The End. This whole movie was very predictable I think, and SO VERY SLOW! There were only about 3 lines of actual dialogue the rest of the movie was either in this vague sort of symbolic voice over or just represented visually like in the way she looked or he looked in their eyes. Even though Pocahontas knew English perfectly by the end of the movie you wouldn't have known it, because there was so little speaking. I was really waiting for them to start singing 'Paint with all the colors of the wind'. But it never happened. It certainly would have brought the beat up a little. This movie had absolutely zero happy/exciting/slightly upbeat parts. In order to feel the lows one must feel the joy, but this movie really did not allow us to do that. I think this movie really had the potential to tell a really awesome story, but it let me down. The movie was beautiful cinematically, the scenery was really great (I don't know how they found some of those beautiful landscapes in today's world) and the camera angels were usually pretty interesting (I had to think of something nice to say) but, I don't know anything more about Pocahontas or John Smith now than I did before. Don't rent it. It will bore you to tears. Unless you are doing a project on the subject for school it is totally not worth it.",3,1,7,15 May 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Finding a Fantasy world in the unkind real world.
","Not a fan of the no Spanish rule in comments IMDb!ANYWAY!Pans Labyrinth was an absolutely hypnotizing film with a spectacular balance of fantasy and reality, brilliant special effects and a powerful story. I loved the little baby plant thing, and when it was burnt it almost made me cry, the screams of pain were heart wrenching. I can't say I've ever seen a movie that took place in Franco Spain, but for a movie that wasn't really about that, I would say it still gave us a feel for what that time may have been like. It gave historical information in a non-'history channel' kind of way which allowed the viewer to become more a part of the story enchanting story.In general child actors annoy me, I however found Ivanna Baquero endearing and I thought she was a perfect guide for our journey through the labyrinth (this may have been solely because she wasn't speaking English). I really felt for the poor child throughout the whole movie, she had the misfortune of being brought in to a cruel world and her only salvation was the world in her mind. I wanted to wrap her up and take her home with me, and let her know everything would be all right. In the end it unfortunately was not all all right, but the journey was certainly entertaining! Ah, the ironic world of movies. Working at a video store in the middle of hick town many people are wary of renting this particular one because quote 'I don't liake to hafta read ma movays'. I however happen to watch ALL my movies at home, whether in a foreign language or not, with the subtitles on. (That way I make sure I don't miss a thing). This one just also helped me brush up on some of my Spanish! So do not fear the Labrinto! Embrace it! While reading some other reviews I found that many people did not like this movie because it did not meet their 'expectations'. No, it is not a movie for children, nor is a pure science fiction movie built on fantasy and special effects. I don't believe it was ever intended to be so. I can easily see where children would be frightened by it, and where a LOTR fan would be disappointed if they thought it would be anything like it. So, go see this movie, it was beautiful, but just expect an interesting movie, with a touching story and nothing else.My website http://MarysMovieReviews.blogspot.com",9,2,5,20 May 2007
Black Snake Moan," Creative story outdone by cheap thrills
","A sex addicted Christina Ricci, Samuel L. Jackson withissues; and a complete ensemble cast where each character comes with their very own unique problems creates this interesting but just short of 'good' film. This is the story of a lonely god fearing Lazarus who tries to turn Rae's life around by chaining her up in his house and breaking her of her urges.I felt this movie had great potential and basis, I think the idea and basic story are really good and could have gone many beautiful places, but I thought they went the cheap route and drug people in to the theater with numerous sex scenes and a naked Christina Ricci. I believe the idea for this movie was really creative and new, but I think it was executed poorly.Christina and Samuel did pretty well, but I don't think Ricci's accent was very well done, as a matter of fact I think she's done it before and I didn't like it then either, she will never outlive Wednesday for me. However I think both of them probably only took these roles because it gave them a chance to sing, actors like that sort of crap. Jackson was very interesting as an older man; not playing someone with a gun where every other word has four letters and starts with an F is very refreshing. Please don't confuse this at all with Snakes on a Plane, it has almost NOTHING to do with snakes and there is very little gun action, this one was actually respectable.Which brings we to another point that I think there was a bit too much singing in the movie. I probably should have paid a bit more attention to the words they were singing but I just got distracted. The songs were pretty and showed us a lot about Jackson's character but slowed down the film at parts.There were some really great parts in this film, the relationship between Lazarus and Angela was touching, and I thought the conversation Laz had with the young boy was really cute, but the sexual nature of this film over powered the grass roots feel I felt this movie could have portrayed quiet well.Overall, I wouldn't want to watch this again. The beginning middle and end had a depressing cloud hanging over it that was never really resolved and I don't like movies that are depressing the whole time, it just drags me down. If you are fans of Jackson, Ricci or even Justin Timberlake you will probably enjoy this movie more than I, so give it a chance. It does have a really interesting and neat title!",5,3,8,28 June 2007
The Fountain," Eternity Indeed
","The FountainI'm not even really sure I could accurately tell you what this film was about. There was probably all sorts of symbolism in it that went over my head, and while I'm not adverse to symbolism, many movies use it in quiet beautiful and powerful ways, when it's used sorandomly, and seemingly without rhyme or reason as the fountain did, the audience is lost and therefore the movie loses any potential it had to really effect it's viewers. I quickly became bored and confused by this movie. The main idea behind the film is a quest for immortality and trying to find eternal life, which if I'm not mistaken, in the end we realize is never truly possible.Hugh Jackman's performance was elevated only by the skill at which this films' costume team pulled off some terrific looking outfits. I think he portrayed the part of a hopeless husband rather well; his crying was usually very believable, but the creepy bald guy and the practically mute Spaniard were dull and much too vague to connect with.While I love Rachel Weisz in many of her films, Constant Gardener is one of my favorites, I however felt that her sickly, present-day character was fake and annoying, but the way she pulled off the Queen of Spain was quite beautiful. Well-spoken and emotionless, much as you would expect a queen to be. While roles such as these I am sure are a dream for any actor it seemed to me that they clearly focused more on one character than another and left us wanting more from their performances all around.The Fountain just confused me, I feel that the purpose of film, in general, is to connect with the audience, and when filmmakers use their stage only to express their inner thoughts in completely vague and emotionally vacant ways, the audience feels abandoned and that's exactly how I felt. At the end of this film I was confused and bored, no connection was made.However, this film did achieve one common goal of film. It made me thinkjust harder than I would like. It raised questions of immortality and eternal life, a common quest of human beings since the dawn of time. It questioned life and death and made me think about them more than I normally would. While the special effects were brilliant, particularly at the end, the substance wasn't there to back it up. Movie history can not be made on special effects alone.My Website http://MarysMovieReviews.blogspot.com",3,3,7,17 May 2007
The Last King of Scotland," A terrifying global issue presented from a terrified individuals perspective.
","Uganda is in turmoil and as we follow the life of young Dr. Nicholas Garrigan in his interesting life progression as Idi Amin's personal physician during his stay in the unstable country. We get an insiders look at the brains and brawn behind the corrupt government of the time. Films depicting the chaos in Africa never get old; it's such a drastic change from anything we are used to seeing in the United States that even to begin to fathom that things like this movie showed happened only a few years ago (1970's) automatically leaves the audience enraptured. This movie was astounding and emotionally beautiful. It gave us a look at the complete global devastation going on in Uganda but from an individual perspective, something I believe is often a recipe for success, this film was above and beyond successful.Forrest Whittaker was brilliant as Idi Amin, he was more than deserving of the Oscar. He was able to capture the personal compassion that Amin clearly believed he possessed, while at the same time showing us the eerily terrifying persona those around him experienced. He certainly scared me, not only in his violence, but also in his uneasy kindness, we never knew what he was thinking, and that can often be the most terrifying thing of all.While Whittaker was outstanding I don't think the gentleman who played Dr. Garrigan has been given enough credit for this movie. Can you even tell me his name without looking it up? I'll give you a minute. It's James McAvoy, but either way, it is through his eyes the story is being told and I believe that it is really him that this movie is truly about. However he unfortunately doesn't even appear on the DVD box cover. What is that about? Not only did I find him very attractive (Who wouldn't.) but also I found his acting enticing and very believable and I really felt for him throughout the movie. By the middle of the movie I was earnestly hoping things would turn out good for him, and I winced with every strike he received from the brutal guards of Amin. McAvoy deserves much more credit and recognition from the public for his brilliant portrayal of the young and naïve doctor.This movie has most certainly been added to my list of favorites. It has all the elements of a fantastic movie. The plot, the characters, the setting were all perfectly mixed together to produce what I believe was cinematic gold. It address social issues, but not in a drab documentary sort of way, sometimes it is necessary to put these sort of statements into narratives such as these in order to be able to reach a larger, sometimes less cultured audience. This is a movie that all people, from everywhere, from all walks of life should see. It can give you a new perspective on global issues and possibly enlighten you to some of the tragedy that has (and still is) occurring in third world countries. While I'm sure much of it may not be historic fact, it is eye opening nonetheless. Make everyone and your mother see this film; I don't think you will regret it.",10,2,4,2 June 2007
Music and Lyrics," Sing Along with this Romantic Comedy (maybe laugh a little less).
","Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore take us on the romantically comedic ride of their coincidental meeting and accident-ridden relationship.I can only describe this movie, and the millions of other films like it, as cute and delightful, but not in an overly enthusiastic way. A cute story with fun characters and an up beat atmosphere, but certainly not cinematic gold. However, I am perfectly aware that this was never the intended goal of the filmmakers, so when reviewing movies such as this I'm always hesitant. Do I look at it completely critically and grade it on par with all other movies ever, in which it would never come close or do I take it for what it was intended to be by the filmmakers, just a fun two hour date movie, and give it a thumbs up for completing it's goal? I don't know. All I know is that I feel much better about myself after watching stupid comedy's than I do after watching some deep meaningful drama, just physically, I don't need an aspirin afterwords. I wont make a definite decision now; I'll just go with the flow I suppose. But I can't ever completely deny the small place the romantic comedy holds in my heart.I found the plot base to definitely be unique, I never knew how people went about writing songs, and after watching this I can at least pretend like I do, even if that's not actually how it happens. Otherwise though, I felt it had the usual romantic comedy plot twists and I didn't find myself ever totally caught off guard, which I must say is something I happen to enjoy in a film once in a while, so no points there for Music & Lyrics.I found most of the characters to be charmingly entertaining. Kristen Johnson's character as the Popz obsessed fan was great, and I really wish she would do even more acting, I think she's great. Brad Garret also played a perfectly depressing talent agent. Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore were there usual romantic comedy-selves. Drew's character was a very small stretch for her and there was absolutely ZERO stretch for Hugh Grant (Playing the stuck-upish character who is brought back down to earth by the love interestnothing new for Hughie). They were entertaining nonetheless.I absolutely LOVED the soundtrack for this movie. The songs they made up for the '80's pop group' were perfect and the music video was spot on with the 'creepy makes no sense' style of the 80's music videos. The end song I also found to be really cute, and definitely appropriate, it made me feel warm and fuzzy which I suppose is the ultimate goal of any movie like this. I tried to download to some of the songs because they were just that catchy; I'm still working on it. Let me know if you can find them.Overall a very cute movie, as far as Romantic comedies go it was one of the better ones. Not a complete waste of my time, and if you want an un-depressing, relaxing evening why not check it out, you might get a great song stuck in your head too.",7,0,0,6 June 2007
