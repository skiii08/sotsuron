The Blair Witch Project," Crapola to the max
","Can't say enough bad things about this piece of garbage. And how in the world did anyone think it was scary. Explain one scary part, any. I've made tons of videos and none were as shaky as this, its like they did it on purpose. Girl was a annoying Yenta, the guys were o.k. but nothing great acting wise. Supposedly this was a rip off of the film, The Last Broadcast. Saw it also, equally bad. Both plots sounded cool, with broadcast involving the Jersey Devil. Somebody should redo either of these and make it work this time. And for Pete sake, show something, i have some neighbors who could pass for a scary witch or Jersey devil........",Null,16,31,13 March 2002
Scarface," Still hold water after all these years.
","I still laugh when i see in the TV guide that they give this 2 stars. Good to see the reviewers here at IMDb think differently. I've seen all the great gang movies, from the Godfather movies to New Jack City. But this still remains my favorite. From the endless classic one liners to Tony's famous outburst, how can you go wrong. Plus the great shots of FlA and the early 80's music and dance scene bring back the old days. Good acting all the way around and Michelle never looked better. Every summer when i go either white water rafting or just goofing in the pool when i'm holding my water canon and about to shoot, I always come back to my favorite all time movie line- Say hello to my little friend. Lol...",Null,0,1,15 December 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Terrible is an understatement
","Finally saw this on cable yesterday. Holy cow. Where to begin. To say this movie stunk is a vast understatement. Bad acting, terrible dumb one line jokes. I didn't come close to laughing at any of the bologna throw at the screen. I sorta felt like the people on that train in NYC. Everyone just looking around at each other like, whose is this moron and that stupid chicken. The classic comedy of all time, Animal House gets a 7.6 and this totally hunk of crap gets a higher rating. Like the teacher in Fast Times at Ridgemont high states- You people on dope? I should of known better to try and sit through this. I saw that Sacha Cohen on John Stewart earlier this year and he wasn't funny than. He did his stupid shtick on that show and it was pretty dumb.",Null,4,10,17 October 2007
United 93," Painful watching but still a great movie.
","Its hard to rate this movie. Just as hard it is to watch. From a film critic point of view. Its outstanding. I actually wasn't impressed by Greengrass's Bourne Supremacy. The camera work was too shaky. But here, its done with a masterpiece touch to it. Like allot of viewers before me, it really felt like i was on that plane. Even the pre-hijacking process of boarding a plane and all the other things involved with flying is done very well. Which makes this feel even more tragic. I for the life of me can't understand some of the (very few i might say) negative reviews of this film. Reading the Yahoo movie section, there are quite a few nut-cases reviewing this. Anyone who lives in the NYC area can't possibly feel that way about this movie. The one image that still haunts me, is the scene after the flight takes off and the plane angles around Manhattan, and in the one window, you see the top of the Twin Towers. How many times i have flown from Newark and watched that same image. And know that it won't ever be seen again.",Null,9,18,28 April 2006
This Is the End," Pretty bad movie.
","Remember this getting somewhat good reviews last summer. So when it came on cable last night, I gave it a chance. Well it's pretty bad movie. Barely funny at all, I didn't laugh till about an hour into the movie. Its like these Hollywood guys said, wtf, lets make a stupid horror movie and lets see what fools buy it. Well judging by some of the reviews, people did. Seriously, some people said it was like the funniest movie ever? Yeah right, Doesn't hold a candle to Caddyshack, Animal House, My cousin Vinny, Something about Mary or Fast Times a Ridgemont High. I would of gave this trash a 1, but some of the cgi special affects were cool. But that's pushing it... And yeah, I guess gouging someones eyes out still allows you to go to heaven under these guidelines set in this movie.",Null,4,8,25 January 2014
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Classic
","I'm not a fan of Western style movies. But there are exceptions, and this one is it. After all these years, seeing on cable this week, it still a masterpiece of film making. You have the great shots of the old west. The great blending of old black in white video into color. And of course the great chemistry between Newman and Redford. I can't think of another duo in a movie that had such a great mix together. So may great one liners you can't even get through all of them. I still laugh my arse off when they first arrive in Bolivia and Redford steps in crap and gives that look to the camera like, what the heck are we doing here. You almost wish the ending was different. Like they could of made it out of there and over to Australia. That could be an entire new movie.",Null,0,2,3 October 2007
Jarhead," Not bad.
","I saw the movie preview of this in theater and said, this is going to blow. Than it came on cable recently and decided what the f. and watched it. Its actually pretty good. I got one thing wrong, its about the first gulf war, for some reason i thought it was about the beginning of this current war. Not that it matters. I guess the thing that hit me was the infidelity part of the movie. You have one guy getting a video from his wife of her cheating on him and Jakes girlfriend giving him the boot when he gets back. Something that happen to me in the military. Its a topic not often brought up in War movies. But happens to military personal all the time who spend a good amount of time away from home. The other aspect that of the film i liked was the shots of the oil well fires. Pretty good cgi. I really thought this was filmed in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait. Than i read in filming locations it was filmed all in the U.S. In any case, if you like war movies like i do, you shouldn't be too disappointed with this.",Null,4,6,23 April 2007
Dark City," Great Sci fi....
","Still one of my all time favorite science fiction movies. Great plot. Great special affects. Acting is top notch... You rarely see such classic sci fi nowadays. Lately, It's all stupid comic book crap like Iron Man, Transformers and Spiderman. Which explains the clueless bad reviews from younger reviewers who have no patience for a good developing plot. Glad to finally see it played on cable. Until recently, I have never found it available on any premium channels till lately. But I noticed it has shown up on Comcast these past few weeks. Plot is totally original. Humans are taken to this experimental Ship to help save a dying Alien race. Only to find out they are too different from us to help save themselves from their fate...",Null,3,6,29 April 2013
Saving Private Ryan," For what it is..
","The first time i saw this movie in August, i didn't know what to make of it. I knew i liked it. But was left numb. I saw it again in Sept. And realized that it's a great movie. It's no longer in American theaters, but will be released around nomination time next year. For the anti american sector. Like one viewer mentioned. The beach they came ashore on was 100 percent American. So it wasn't anti- rest of the allied forces- like people mention. I grew up with all the old war movies, and you can't tell me this isn't the most honest depiction of war you have ever scene. And the plot to rescue one man. Hell i was in the military, and i've seen stranger crap than this. As 4 the age factor, yeah, most military people are 18 to 21, but if u ever were in the service, the guys that stayed in were mostly in their 30's. It seems once u re-enlist. You stay the whole course in the military. So that explains the age difference. You're either a 1st termer or a lifer, there seems no in between.  Anyway, i thought it was a movie that should be seen by any future military types..... PK",Null,0,0,12 December 1998
The Dark Knight," Way Overrated.
","The buzz from the entire media, and the general public made it sound like this was the second coming of Star Wars. Well it wasn't. A matter of fact, this way over hyped pile of garbage is one of the worse movies i have seen in years. Where to begin. Lets start with the so called great acting. You must be kidding me. Ledger does not deserve an Oscar nomination for this. If anything, Jack Nicholson does a far better job playing the Joker. Christian Bale basically mumbles through most of his Bat man parts, and isn't much better when he isn't. Plot is stupid as heck. They make the Joker sound like some super human beast from another world. A dozen officers with machine guns would of killed him off in 2 seconds. But i guess that would of ruined the story line. Any way you analyze this movie. Its just plain old bad.",Null,62,142,31 July 2008
When Harry Met Sally...," Great movie.
","Is there honestly a better Romantic comedy out there than this? So many movies you see are more comedy than there is Romance or any serious plot. This ones hits all the right notes. I think allot of people can relate to this movie, because we see some of ourselves in the characters that are portrayed. Having seen this in the theater when released, it has become one of my favorite movies. Countless great scenes. Even small scenes like when Harry tells his friend Jess about the movers arriving at his place has a combo. of humor but also sadness because Harry knows his marriage is kaput. Sorta the way life is. Crystal has one great one liner after another. And all the actors in this movie are great. Its a ones in a blue moon good movie. And thats what makes it a classic.",Null,1,2,21 October 2007
War of the Worlds," A Classic.
","I agree with most of the reviewers here on IMDb. This is a excellent picture. One of the best Alien movies I've seen. I can watch it a million times on cable and it never gets old. After watching that horrendous Dark Knight last year, I figure, what the heck, this can't be much worse. Instead, I turned out to be a classic in all the sense. Fantastic special affects. Great acting. Great plot. Probably wish they would of shown more of the Tripods attack on places around the NYC area. but Maybe less is more. The CGI is really good. So many movies now, you watch them and you say to yourself- lousy computer effects. Even the music score is a classic. Its a keeper for anyone who truly loves good science fiction.",Null,0,4,18 April 2009
30 Days of Night," Pretty good.
","Allot better than I thought. Had some pretty scary scenes in there from time to time. Sorta took the 28 days later feel with the quick attacking zombies that come out of nowhere. Which I like. Those old movies with these blood craving Zombies walking along at 1 mph, while the victims always seem to fall down and lay there till the monster gets them, always seem fake and stupid. At least here, you feel general fear with putting yourself in these peoples places. Acting was pretty good. Good scary feeling with this nighttime/cold snowy feel to the movie. If I had to have a grief, its the same with allot of movies- the ending. More realistic way to end the movie was to have these zombies realize the sun is finally rising, but have Hartnett stop them from going into hiding, or wherever they came from. But, I can deal with that. 90 percent of the movie is a good solid scare-gore fest..",Null,3,4,7 April 2009
Jaws," The Original Blockbuster.
","Still remember sitting in my grandmothers garage when my cousin showed me the cover of the Book, Jaws. And how the movie version just came out. And to great reviews. I was like, do i want to see something this scary looking? Well we did. And seeing in the theater back than, when there weren't many mega theaters. Just single, huge theaters where u had to wait online for an hour. And get the real movie experience of seeing it in the theater with 500 other people. And boy, was it scary. Still remember a girl a couple rows in front of me chucking her popcorn in the air when that head pops out in that boat scene. Now many years later, i finally caught in on cable (real cable, not those bs channels that have commercials every 5 min. and there stupid pop up add adv.) And it still holds up. Great acting all across the board. The filming is perfect. I even tried to look for flaws in the shark itself, and it looks real to me, with the one exception of the scene where the shark land on the back of the Orca and starts to sink it. But thats a minor gripe. Whenever i'm down the Jersey Shore, I still have this image of Quint singing the Fair Spanish lady song. For a horror movie, There are funny scenes like that also. A true classic from Mr. Spielberg.",Null,2,6,11 May 2008
Platoon," A war movie not to be forgotten anytime soon.
","I've seen many war movies over the years. Including Platoon when it came out in the theater. And having just seen it again on cable i realize what a classic film it is. It feels as fresh and powerful as it was when i saw it when i was in the military. And how it left an impression on me than, as now. Great acting across the board. Filming style was great. I think the two parts of the movie that hit home for me the most are the famous scene with Sheen staring at incoming vc while is heart beats faster and faster. And the very end where Sheen is flying out of country while giving his thoughts to everything he went through over there. I have my war film favorites like Patton, Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down. All great movies. In this tough list, i would have to give Platoon the slight edge as my all time favorite.",Null,0,1,8 February 2008
The Thin Red Line," Not a war movie...
","After seeing one of the best war movies of all time (Ryan) this is the worse war movie i've ever seen. Sorta Platoon and English  Patient in one.  If ur going to make a war movie, than make one, not this collection of overdone mushy crap.  I usually agree with the popular critics when it comes to movies, well the good reviews for this have dumbfounded me.. I grew up with world war 2 as my most favorite subject. This isn't the Guadalcana i remember reading about.",Null,7,14,16 January 1999
The Thin Red Line," What a bad movie..
","I dogged out movies like Godzilla and Armageddon.  But they were somewhat interesting. This piece of garbage is the worse movie I've scene since The second Batman.  All the Yahoo's who know nothing of war and movies pertaining to war, love this movie. I dont know why.  Want to see a good war movie. The list is endless, Platoon, Tora Tora Tora,  Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, The Deer Hunter,  Midway,  All quiet on the western front, The Longest day, Das Boot.  This movie is something to been seen if you need a good nap.",Null,1,5,25 February 1999
