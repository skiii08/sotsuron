The King's Speech," The king has the last word
","You can feel the sheer terror and embarrassment of the king every time he steps up talk. Magnificent performances by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. Helena Bonham Carter portrayed a calming presence on screen which just shows how diverse her acting talent is. Michael Gambon as the late King and Guy Pearce as the embarrassment to the royal family were both amazing.Great direction and extravagant set designs and artwork make this a memorable movie. A heartwarming story on the eve of destructive war. A beauty to watch.Despite my feelings of how marvelous this movie was, it was rather dull that a speech impediment created out of fear was the heart of the problem and it wasn't even a traumatic fear instilled into him but more likely a fear of being below standards when compared to his father or brother. I do not criticize nor belittle people with speech impediment, it was merely not a theatrical set of events that needed to be dramatized for a feature film. It felt like a glorified effort to uphold the office of the crown and it's many little misgivings. Leaving my personal feelings aside, it was all in all a great movie filled with stellar performances.",8,0,0,29 March 2020

Total - 7.3Despite the movie riding on Will Smith's coattails, he wasn't the Fresh Prince you were glad to see on screen. Mena Massoud brings about a refreshing look at the character Aladdin and Naomi Scott portrays Jasmine just as I would imagine. I would say despite Will Smith being annoying at times, I enjoyed his song and dance sequences and his humor was much more bearable towards the second half of the movie.All in all a good entertaining family movie among the other good entertaining family movie reboots. A treat for your nostalgia while I'm sure all the Robin Williams Genie fans hated the big blue Will Smith, the movie was salvaged by the young talent. If you don't sing along then you wouldn't enjoy the movie as much as I did.",7,1,2,5 October 2019
Prisoners," Criminal masterpiece
","Stellar performances by all of the cast. An exceptional performance by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Nothing short of nail biting, gripping thriller. The director simply takes you through an amzing maze while you empathize for the protagonists. A must watch.",9,0,0,22 March 2020
Castle in the Sky," Ahead of its time
",This movie follows two lovable little characters as they wade through armies and pirates in search of the castle in the sky. A classic movie on the destructive force of human greed and thirst for power and how only the purest of hearts will survive in harmony with nature. A common theme in a lot of dystopian movies is how mankind destroys nature as he takes what he wants and doesn't care for the delicate balance it needs to survive together and this movie depicts it with an undertone of hope.,8,0,0,24 March 2020
Joker," Not everyone gets the joke but he will definitely be the only one laughing when it is punchtime
","When you are down, depressed and hurting inside, when society creates a false sense of security, all you got to do is introduce a little anarchy. Upsetting the natural order has always been what the Joker is best at and Joaquin Phoenix is remarkable as the Joker.This movie touches on the lack of empathy of the high end society and the pain and suffering only those at the bottom of the chain feel. It brings out emotions you never knew you had balled up inside you.You root for the protagonist despite knowing what he is going to do and is going to become, you empathize with the scum of Gotham like you are one of them. This movie gives a whole new reason for the cringy pulse dropping menacing laugh of the joker and a deeper meaning to his whole psychotic persona and why he is by far the best villain ever.",10,1,3,16 October 2019
Parasite," You can smell it everywhere
","Just like most movie goers, I didn't know what the plot was about. Despite the urge to google it, I stayed away. Now after watching it I realized I still wouldn't have been prepared for what was ahead. A fast paced thriller centered around two families. Like two sides of a coin, they're polar opposites, yet they are crucial for the coin to spin.Along with the unnerving feeling you have trying to figure out this movie, it's also filled with a lot humor, thrill and some family drama with a social message that is cleverly stitched into this feature. Brilliant acting and amazing set d√©cor and intricately designed sequences make this a classic on its own.A masterpiece by director Bong Joon Ho. He has his own directorial style and this movie is probably the best of them all. Adopting certain aspects from all his other movies while creating a uniquely critical film for ages to come, he has added his name into the directors hall of fame. He won the Oscars for best director, best original screenplay, best international film and best picture matching a 67 year old record set by Walt Disney.If you plan to watch it, don't read about it, just latch on to the host and don't let go.",10,1,2,27 March 2020
Marriage Story," Love doesn't always make sense
","Throughout the movie you are left at awe at the apt title for the movie. Takes you through their emotions and makes you feel like you're part of the whole process. You put yourselves in each other's shoes and hate the other person and it goes back and forth brilliantly. Great acting by Scarlett and Adam.How I decided my rating:

He proved himself a Creed in the first movie and has to overcome what his father failed at in the second movie.Sylvester Stallone does a good job as the father type mentor and Tessa Thompsons helps as a good soulmate. The story has the general motivation a sports based movie requires with the added motivation for the opposition also which I think helped me enjoy it a bit more.Overall a great movie breaking the curses of sequels.",7,0,1,2 December 2018
Toy Story 3," Not just a Toy
","There is something for everyone in this movie. Pixar never ceases to amaze. Another gem in this amazing Toy Story franchise.Never has any toy looked as cool Buzz Lightyear.

","From saving private Ryan to saving Mr.Banks, Tom Hanks is incredible while playing the famous Walt Disney.

Monty Python and the Holy Grail," No horses were harmed during the making of this movie
","The subtitles and the credits are proof enough that this is going to be one hell of an hilarious movie. Who knew moose's and Llamas were so intelligent. With enough jokes to offend anyone, this movie is packed with laughs, pointless plots and twisted conversations that keep your gut hurting throughout the movie. Special congratulations to the epic artwork for making up for the lack of technology.",8,1,1,24 March 2020
Incredibles 2," The wait was worth it
","Incredible in every meaning of the word. When it comes to super family, they've thought everything through. Touching on issues with insecurity of ordinary people with reference to supers and also the difficulty in raising kids no matter the age with or without abilities. A true beacon of hope for other supers, the incredibles (Pixar studios) have yet again shown us that there are very few things they could mess up",9,7,11,9 July 2018
