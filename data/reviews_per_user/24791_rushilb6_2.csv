United 93," One of my favorite movies of all time
","Some movies are so good you end up crying at the end. Some you don't. Some people like to maintain a record of not crying through movies. I dare someone to watch this movie and not cry. That streak will end with this movie. I have watched this movie 5 times and I haven't gone through a single viewing without crying. I love this movie so much. I find myself crying not because they all die at the end, but because of the heroic act of retaking the plane. Because of 40 brave souls, that plane did not reach its target that day. The suspenseful music by John Powell was a great addition to the retaking scene. I literally had tears coming out of my eyes. I can say Paul Greengrass is a tremendous director that should win an Oscar. He directed Captain Phillips as well, which I liked just as much. I think everyone should take a chance and watch this movie, because it is great.",10,0,1,12 September 2014
Forrest Gump," Amazing movie
","I love this movie so much. It works as a comedy, and it teaches you really important life lessons. I admit, when I first saw this movie, I wasn't used to Tom Hanks and his southern accent. But this simpleton shows that you can do anything you want in life if you set your mind to it. I laughed at the times when Forrest says stuff that 'Mama' used to say. And I really liked all the historical references like Vietnam, Watergate Scandal, and possibly the invention of the smiley face. Forrest shows us that anyone can achieve big things in life, even if you aren't capable. He gets the Medal of Honor, saving lives, and he didn't need to beef up on strength or anything. He didn't even have to pick up a ping pong paddle at an early age to be a master at ping pong. And he didn't even need to be a track star to run a cross country journey for a really long time. This movie really taught me to never give up.",10,4,6,18 August 2014
