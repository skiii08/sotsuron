Requiem for a Dream," Requiem for why?
","After hearing forever how this movie was awesome my girlfriend bought it and sat me down and made me watch it. I will sum up my experience in one sentence. 'This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I have ever seen.' This movie is horribly shot and horribly acted along with a horrible story of drug trafficking and making a quick buck. Maybe it was the reality of the movie that just turned my stomach so sour, being that I have seen and lived a similar life before I turned it around. The movie is really just bad and if you never see it I think you would be better off. The film is not art but rather garbage paraded as art. The side story really takes away from the main story and makes the whole movie move slowly and painfully by.",1,4,10,19 August 2009
