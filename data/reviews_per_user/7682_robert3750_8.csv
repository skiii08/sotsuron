Blade Runner 2049," Interesting visuals, but story falls flat
","All the story really mounts to is that Deckard and Rachel had a child. That's nice, but it doesn't really make a difference in the world of the movie. Rachel was a unique creation of Tyrell's, and it's made clear that the big corporate baddie (there's no more prevalent stereotype in Hollywood than the evil/amoral businessman, but I digress) can't duplicate it, nor presumably, can anyone else. Furthermore, the fact that the child has to live in a bubble means she's essentially a genetic dead end. Also, Rachel dies after giving birth via c section, implying that it wasn't exactly good for her health to bear a child. In short, there's no basis for thinking that this is going to trigger a wave of replicant self propagation or cause any other fundamental change in the Blade Runner 'universe'. There's talk of a 'revolution' among the replicants, but they hardly needed this particular development to motivate them for that, given how they're treated.The entire movie feels like what I feared--an unnecessary exercise that doesn't really add anything to the story.",3,3,6,8 January 2018
Alien 3," Revolting
","This thing gets things off on the wrong foot by pissing on the previous movie's emotional underpinnings, killing off two characters from the previous movie 'because'. Too much nihilism, not really giving a damn about anything.",1,0,3,4 May 2020
Casablanca," A timeless masterpiece
","Every time I watch this, my estimation of it grows and grows. The story, of love found and lost and then found again, of choosing principle over expediency, of deciding what really matters, is timeless. The performances are top notch, aided by the fact that many of the actors were actual refugees from the Nazis. I think of the look of hatred and pain on Bogart's face when he sees Ilsa again for the first time, of his look of loss at the train station, of his look of nobility when he tells her that the 'good fight' is worth what they have to give up as he says 'here's looking at you, kid'. A bittersweet romantic outcome for the ages. I think of how luminous Ingrid looks, and how expressive her eyes are as she experiences love, pain, sorrow, joy, and regret. Great, crackling dialogue. It amazes me that the script was essentially written on the fly, and they didn't even decide until late how it would all turn out. One of the all time great films.",10,0,0,11 April 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," Tonally confused
","Some humor is welcome in a superhero movie, but TR is so determined to ladle out the yuks that it too often forgets to be a superhero movie. Thor as a wimp afraid to get a haircut? Give me a break. I sometimes felt like I was watching he modern Marvel equivalent of an Abbott and Costello parody of the genre. Of course it has some spectacular images, as one would expect with so much CGI being thrown around.The Jeff Goldblum character was annoying instead of funny. Why are modern filmmakers so determine to undermine heroes and destroy things that belong to them?",4,5,9,10 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Sat goodbye to Star Wars
","The great, heroic turn of Darth Vader in destroying the Emperor is now rendered meaningless, since it turns out that the Emperor wasn't destroyed at all, just handed a temporary setback. 'The Empire is destroyed! Hooray! Oops, it really isn't. Um, never mind'. Oh, and force ghosts can now interact with the real world. And Jedi can now teleport across the galaxy. And heal light saber stabbings. Rey is the fricking Mary Sue of Mary Sues. And star destroyers now have the destructive power of death stars. IOW, forget everything you knew about Star Wars and turn off your brain, which many people are obviously eager to do.",1,22,37,22 December 2019
Die Hard 2," Full of ridiculous plot holes
","Extremely annoying. Yiu have planes that stay in a holding pattern, because apparently NO OTHER AIRPORTS EXIST ON THE ENTIRE EAST COAST. You have airport officials that can't contact anybody about the terrorists, except they do so effortlessly when the script calls for it. Oh, and of COURSE they can ONLY contact people who are part of the conspiracy. What ridiculous twadddle.",1,7,14,23 March 2018
Avatar," Predictable, pretentious, and cliche-ridden
","I give this movie 3 stars only for its interesting visuals. The story is an utterly trite regurgitation of Pocahontas and Dances with Wolves: See James Cameron saying European/white civilization is bad. See James Cameron saying technology is bad. See James Cameron saying capitalism is bad. See James Cameron saying primitives are naturally wiser, kinder, more ethical, more moral, more 'in touch with nature', etc. etc. ad nauseum. Of course, Cameron himself made a gazillion bucks with a capitalist enterprise, and has more vehicles and more technology created by the civilization he rakes over the coals than 99 percent of the population, and isn't interested in giving it all up while preaching that the rest of us have to make do with less, but people are obviously untroubled by that.And, of course, none of the people oohing and ahhing over the primitive culture depicted here have any interest in chucking it all going off to live in the rain forest while wearing a loin cloth, including Cameron, but that's also to be overlooked.",3,2,4,4 March 2018
Cinderella," Wrong emphasis, good only for little kids
","It may seem blasphemous to say that Disney didn't properly handle a classic fairy tale, but I think it's true in this case. The emphasis on the cute talking animals is all wrong. This is supposed to be a story about Cinderella, not talking mice, etc. Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo is a cute song, and A Dream Is A Wish is nice (it doesn't mention love at all), but they do not convey the true romantic element that is crucial to the story. The prince is given practically no character development. She's supposed to fall in love with him because he dances and is a prince? That's it? What really made up my mind about the Disney effort is watching the 1965 TV version with Lesley Ann Warren. The Rodgers and Hammerstein songs in it are magnificent, truly conveying the romantic passion, desire and love of a man and a woman for each other, as well as the romantic idealism of the story. The Disney songs can't hold a candle to them. The prince is given good character development. We see HIS loneliness and desire to find his true love. We see that he is kind and gracious and thoughtful and gentle. He is given a scene where he expresses a desire not to be seen as a 'prize' to be won, but a man to be loved. The 1965 version is the timeless classic for all hopeless romantics. The Disney version is for the little kiddies wanting to see something cute.",4,0,0,28 March 2020
