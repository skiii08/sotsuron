Requiem for a Dream," Depressing
","This was probably one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. It reminded me of the first time I watched 'Christiana F.'. That movie made me very clear that drugs is a big no no for me.Although I gave this movie an 8 out of 10 I never want to see it again. The 8 is for the high quality acting, especially Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly impressed me. And also the big impact this film had on me. Iwanted to see this movie because I was curious about the director after seeing 'Pi'. Now I can say with certainty that the work of Darren Aronofsky is not my thing.If you still think that a needle is cool after watching this movie...",8,6,11,1 February 2007
