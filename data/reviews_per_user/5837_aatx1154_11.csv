Requiem for a Dream," Absolutely Phenomenal!
","Never I have I seen a movie quite like this one. Absolutely flawless. From the acting (Ellen Burstyn should have won the Oscar), to the directing, editing, and the soundtrack everything was perfect. The soundtrack is one of the best ever. Powerful it impacts you on all levels. I watched this movie over a year ago and still think about it from time to time. This of one of the few movies that have done that to me. One of the best movies ever in my opinion. Highly recommend it.                  ********** 10 stars out of 10!",10,0,1,13 November 2003
The Young Victoria," Splendidly Royal
","A new side to the story of Victoria and Albert is brought to life by director Jean-Marc Valle. Most people's cursory thoughts of Queen Victoria is that of woman who reigned for several decades and lived her life in mourning. Emily Blunt is more than capable in the title role as she gives audiences a different perspective. She portrays Victoria in her youth, ascension to the throne, and early years. Blunt's Victoria both fresh and restrained throughout the film. Her strongest scenes are with Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All the actors acquit themselves well including Miranda Richardson in what could of been a throw-away role.Though this is not a story of dramatic arcs and histrionic 'acting' moments, the story is still interesting enough to make it worth viewing. There are a few historical liberties that has been taken by the screen writing, the film tries to stay true to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and of the social and royal structure of the time period. The set design and costumes are outstanding.This film will be most appreciated by those drawn to history, period dramas, and of Blunt and the other actors. Heartily recommend.Grade: A",8,1,3,28 December 2009
Elizabeth," The woman,the crown and her path to power...
","Elizabeth, the first English feature from Shekar Kapur who would later do The Four Feathers, shows the ascension to the throne of Elizabeth after the reign of Queen Mary. Religious tension as well as gender tension made this transition hazardous for her and this movie does an excellently job of combining the major events of her early life into a concise film. While it may not be 100% accurate, I'm sure length and drama were the cause. Cate Blanchett in the film that launched her career especially after the Golden Globe win is excellent as Elizabeth and other actors in the film are equally good such as Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Ecclesson, and others. The scenery and color of the film are the standouts and this film although being a period piece is never boring. The DVD has plenty of extras including two featurettes and a director's commentary. Overall this is a high quality film that is scheduled to have a sequel in 2006. A good rental or buy.Grade: A",9,0,1,1 October 2004
Closer," Up Close and Personal....
","OK, the wait for me is finally over. Last fall this movie made headlines for the performances given by the cast members. Two of them Clive Owen and Natalie Portman were rewarded with Golden Globe wins and Oscar nominations. The hype was in place and my expectations were high. After seeing the film, i believe it was one the best in 2004. Director Mike Nichols gets good performances by everyone involved and the storyline about different aspects in relationships, emotions, sex, and people is what keeps people intrigued. Very surprised by Julia Roberts performance, it was a revelation to me. But the star of the movie was Natalie Portman and her characters wide range of emotion and actions. The DVD contains only the music video for the film and previews for other movies so that is a little disappointing but over all if you are looking for an adult film about relationships this would be an intriguing rental.Grade: B+",7,1,2,14 April 2005
The Aviator," The Aviator....Lives up to the hype
",The day after this film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards I decided to go see it in the theater to see what all the fuss was about. I was disappointed by Scorsese's previous film and was expecting this one to be the same ploddingly well shot film. Thank god it wasn't. This film hits all cylinders and never misses a beat. ALL of the actors do a fantastic job especially Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn. The film however revolves around Howard Hughes and we see his highs and his lows. The Aviator has throwback feel and look to it complemented by special effects that weave their way into the film seamlessly. At just under three hours long its is paced well and the time goes by without dragging. It really is a good film that deserves all of the attention that it is getting and I recommend it to everyone.Grade: A,9,7,11,26 January 2005
American Psycho," Intresting......
",Well I rented this flick not knowing what to expect. Wow this was an original movie from a unique novel. It was nothing from what I expected and needs multiple viewings to fully grasp everything. Truly a movie in a class of its own. Christian Bale is excellent and Reese Witherspoon plays the type of character that suites her. Be very sure you want to watch this before you rent or buy. Not for everyone. ****** 6 stars out of 10,Null,0,1,11 December 2003
American Beauty," The Quirkiest Best Picture Winner
","American Beauty. What a title. Its different an it doesn't care. The Oscar winner for Best Picture American Beauty is a modern film that is comedic and thoughtful at the same time. There are parts of the characters in this film that all of us can relate to. An allstar cast including Chris Cooper, Thora Birch, Peter Gallagher, and Mena Suvari. All concepts are touched on from family, marriage, kids, love, and  sexuality. Kevin Spacey's character was the lead and received the most praise but I thought that Annette Bening stood out more for me. This film kept the audience hooked the entire time. This film and was well shot and directed. A great rental or purchase.Grade: A",6,0,1,23 March 2004
Moulin Rouge!," Spectacular, Spectacular...
","Moulin Rouge, the Baz Lurhman directed film that was released to great hype a few years ago will be known for bringing back the musical. I watched Chicago first then Moulin Rouge and thought Chicago was clearly better at the time. I thought Moulin Rouge was too different and silly, and not really a REAL musical because a lot of the songs were not original. I then watched it again and the film grew on me. It really does take the viewer on a roller coaster ride of emotions from comedy, to romance, drama, and suspense. Nicole Kidman is absolutely excellent and deserved her Oscar nomination. Ewan McGregor also does a nice job. The DVD contains tons of extra information and is interactive. A very unique film that deserves several watchings to appreciate it fully.Grade: A-",Null,1,2,7 September 2004
Pi," Truly unique
",OK I made the mistake of watching Requiem For A Dream before this and Pi simply cannot hold water to it.Obviously the bigger budget helps for the other film. For his debut film this is pretty original that focuses  on man's mental anguish. Very tough for me to sit through I thought I would love it b/c I liked Requiem so much but this didn't appeal to me too greatly. However I think it should be seen because its one of a kind.                         Grade: B,Null,0,1,24 January 2004
X2: X-Men United," Good action movie
","OK let me start off by saying that I really wasn't enthralled by the first one. This sequel however was better then the previous one with greater action and the introduction of several new characters. Viewing this film through a critic's viewpoint: the acting is weak, emotionally vapid, and almost detached with the exception of Ian McKellen who is brilliant as usual. But forget the critics and go see this film one of the best summer blockbusters in recent years.",Null,0,0,5 December 2003
Gangs of New York," Well made but.....
","Martin Scorsese being the director you know that it is going to be well made. Set in nineteenth century New York, Scorsese tries to do too much in this film. The average movie goer doesn't get a lot of this so its confusing. That said the pace of the film is uneven and generally lags. I thought it was well acted though. Daniel Day Lewis clearly stands out in the film and Cameron Diaz is not that annoying. Leonardo de Caprio was OK. I think this movie was not well recieved b/c simply the storyline and plot was not that interesting to begin with. DVD has plenty of extras and commentary. It was obvious that this was going to get Oscar nods and now I am not that surprised that it got shut out on Oscar night two years ago.Grade: B+",7,0,1,8 March 2004
