It," Best horror movie yet!
","Definetly one of the best horror movies I've ever watched. The story is good enough and the acting is great. Also the jumpscares and the clown itself are not that scary, definitely recommended to horror beginners.",Null,0,0,7 October 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," I was running out of movies and I found this......
","During this long holiday, I decided to revisit some of my childhood memories cuz all the good ones on Netflix seemed to be running out. I picked this one and oh man it was great. I really couldn't believe how much I still enjoy these kinds of children animated fantasy cute spirits movies. This movie really created the most likeable creature of all time. I still wanted to hug that guy so badly just like I was when I was a kid. Other than that, I think the whole movie structured really really well. It never gets too over the top with the fantasies, and it knows exactly when to bring out the serious stuff and get emotional. It is all really well balanced. It also created really likeable characters as there are literally no evil characters throughout the film. Even though this movie sounds really childish, but I can tell you that's absolutely false. I watched it with my family and everyone liked it! This movie is really pure and heart warming and I think everyone will probably like this film. This is sure to be a timeless animated classic that I think everyone should watch. 10 out of 10 for me.",10,1,1,24 March 2020

",I was lost in words after watching this movie. You really can't describe this movie except for the word 'perfect'. Just go watch it and you'll understand.,10,2,5,28 February 2020
