The Mask," crap!
",I hate this film. I don't care how much it made I hate it. The MASK fails and in this era of hollywood still taking itself way too seriously still fails. There aren't enough good 'B' movies like ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK to flush out the stink of this tird.,Null,2,5,12 May 2003
Full Metal Jacket," viet nam film shot in england
",FULL METAL JACKET was a Viet Nam film shot in england. The film was photographed in a section of east london never rebuilt from the blitz. The section of town is called Brixton. For the shoot 50 palm trees were flown in from spain. The reason for the shoot in this section of town was the architech who designed many of the buildings in this part of town designed many buildings in real life HUE city in viet nam where the film is set.,Null,0,0,25 April 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," an insult to america's intelligence
",TERMINATOR 3 is not a bad film on it's own. The film sufferes from plot problems and continuity problems. TERMINATOR 3 is worth one view but it's definetly not a multiple viewing movie. TERMINATOR 1 and 2 are hard acts to follow in this film and this film does not recapture the grandure of either of those films. What i liked was the villian was more in step with the original terminator film. A popcorn and coke film T3 boasts hollywood stunts and eyegrabbing special effects. However many of the attributes that make this film worthwhile hurt it criticaally. The film has plot holes and continuity problems as big as nebraska. The plot holes are of a scope and breadth I would expect in a z grade action picture but not in a first rate action film; these plot holes I might add never show up in the first two films. TERMINATOR 3 is worth a view but buyer beware. If you expect a fun time with a popcorn and coke....by all means go. If you are a discriminating fan who looks deeper you may be dissappointed.,Null,0,0,12 July 2003
Black Hawk Down," a fine war film
","Based on fact, this war film stands out as being one of the very best. The film strives to capture the desperation of the battle and does so. Fast paced and well made BLACK HAWK is not boring and not just another war film. What we get is a visual tour de force that doesn't bore the audience.",Null,0,0,23 April 2003
2001: A Space Odyssey," WORTHWHILE VIEWING
","2001 succeeds where all other science fiction films fall flat. A film unlike anyother, nothing can compare to it. The film brings high art to a genre usually governed by mindless zap gun films. 2001 is a thinking persons science fiction film and well worth watching.",Null,0,2,25 April 2003
The Deer Hunter," Viet Nam war effects on three friends
",THE DEER HUNTER is a film about three friends and the effects the viet nam war had on them. Each character is effected in a different way. THE DEER HUNTER uses the viet nam era as a back drop for the films story.  The film stresses the human toll war takes and is not short of character development. Many things can be said of the film but one thing is for certain the characters never fall flat. A fine drama.,Null,0,0,1 May 2003
