The Blair Witch Project," Innovative arthouse classic AND blockbuster? Almost.
","OK, I'll make one thing clear. I enjoyed this film. However, I wasn't particularly scared or freaked out like I was lead to believe I would. Still, advertisers make a damn good living from making a film seem ten times better than it really is.Maybe it was the fact that when I saw it, I was sharing the experience with several hundred other popcorn-swilling punters in a huge state-of-the-art cinema where you go out expecting to have entertainment handed to you on a plate. Most of the people there weren't phased at all. I say most however; three of my friends were completely messed up by it. Maybe I missed something.I can't help thinking how much more I would have enjoyed it if I had watched it in one of the subterranean screens of the arthouse just down the road. The audience would have been smaller, more subdued and more importantly wouldn't leave their mobile phones turned on. There, after all, is where the film deserved to be because it has bucketloads of artistic merit as opposed to mass appeal. The extensive use of method acting and improvisation really shines in places and if viewed under the right atmosphere, is exceptionally effective.This film doesn't however have the makings of a true classic. Any box office figures that point to the contrary can be put down to media hype. When you look at it, bits of the film don't gel and the audience doesn't really get a chance to truly connect with most of the characters.On the other hand what I like most about this film is that it shows that gritty realism with the absence of glamorous actors, makeup, special effects and post production can work extremely well. I just hope and pray that more filmmakers pick up on this in the future because the contrary has been getting out of hand in recent years.",Null,0,1,2 November 1999
Fight Club," Uncompromising, gripping, intelligent stuff. Amazing.
","To be honest, I've never seen anything like this film. OK, this isn't the most violent, amusing, mentally challenging or disturbing film I have ever seen but the sheer blend of all these qualities is what makes this film probably my favourite this year.The film starts fairly simply, following the life of an insomniac office jockey trying to find a route to happiness but before too long you find it delving into deeper things. Much, much deeper things. And just when you thought it couldn't get any deeper or more intimidating, it does.And that's the beauty of it. The narration and the performances take place in such a relaxed, laid back style you don't realise just how serious some things really are until half a second later than you should. Then it hits you twice as hard as it would do otherwise, leaving 'wow' the only word on your mind. And you can completely forget about trying to predict the plot of this film. It twists more times than I care to count but in the end it all makes perfect sence.In my opinion, this is David Fincher's finest film yet, even eclipsing Seven. This is the sort of film where you can forget about technical things and get completely immersed. You also have to think whilst you watch it and I like that a lot. Not only that, but you will be left thinking about it for weeks afterwards. The acting performances by the main characters is superb all round and that includes Meatloaf. There is more style than you could shake a stick at.Bad points? To be honest, I enjoyed the film so much that I can't think of any off the top of my head. It did get a bit surreal and freaky in places but then again those are the two words of the day when it comes down to it.Be warned however, this film won't appeal to everybody. It does take a rather uncompromising scoop into the human psyche and deals in a lot of primal urges and quite expectedly, it gets violent in places. This won't appeal to everyone but it certainly struck a chord with me. It makes a change to the usual stuff Hollywood normally churns out at least.",Null,0,1,30 November 1999
Fight Club," Intelligent. Imaginative. Disturbing. Unavoidable.
","Whoever you are this film will cause a reaction.Mine was most definitely a good one. It was well acted, well scripted and well made. It was also very cleverly put together and David Fincher uses some very innovative techniques. At the core of the film however is some very astute and intelligent stuff and is loaded with food for thought.The basic premise is that the central character (Norton's) starts out living life in misery despite following all the rules set out by society and advertising culture. It is only after he starts going about things the 'wrong' way that he finds solace. This isn't an easy message for a lot of people but it echos the falseness of modern society and is hard to argue against.There are many people who have slammed the film because it apparently advocates violence and anarchy. The point they are missing is that it only starts that way before slowly demonstrating it slipping out of control. The unpleasantness starts to show through. The hypocrisy becomes evident. (Tyler tries to 'free' people but in the process recruits and effectively brainwashes an army of 'spacemonkeys.') All this goes on until the narrator - and the viewer - are forced to act intelligently and draw a line somewhere and realize that generation X needs to start acting like adults.Bottom line is that you aren't supposed to like what you see. Violence is repulsive and this film demonstrates that very well. There are far too many films where scores of people fall with bloodless machine gun wounds and people are portrayed as heros for inflicting it. This film shows it warts and all. If it encourages you to do violent things, you need help.There is no denying that anyone who approaches this film intelligently will have something to think about here. Whether you agree or disagree with the philosophies is one thing, but most of the negative reviews I have seen are from people who either can't stand to see people actually getting hurt on film and have a central character start out squeaky-clean and end up scarred and twisted at the less than happily-ever-after ending, or miss the point entirely that that only by knowing what it is to have nothing, physically and morally, can you appreciate what it is to have something.",Null,0,1,25 June 2001
Blade," Not to be taken too seriously
","OK, as far as special effect action films go this has to be the prime example. Being based on a comic strip it has over the top action sequences, impossible to rationalise premises and a complete lack of seriousness but hey, it's a fun film.Wesley Snipes delivers a class performance as the hero in designer body armour and Stephan Dorff is great as the chilling vampire equivalent of a juvenile delinquent Decon Frost. (Who, it might be added, must be the first vamp to hit upon the idea of sun block)I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys leave-your-brain-in-the-lobby action flicks. Very entertaining with its tongue planted firmly in the cheek.",Null,0,0,30 November 1998
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The Terminator featuring cartoon violence...
","It's only natural for a franchise to progress in stile as it goes on. You had the original Terminator, which was a sort of sci-fi horror. Then there was Terminator 2, a thought-provoking actioner. And now we have Terminator 3, a teen-orientated, cartoon violence, no-brain popcorn muncher. It seems we have a Terminator for the Buffy the Vampire Slayer generation. Think 'Robocop: the Series' and you might get some idea.Fans of the first two films, like myself, will be mortified. So stay well away. However, ignoring the film's heritage, it still isn't even that good on its own. As a special effects heavy action film, it scores a generous below average. As anything else, it's a non-event. It has bad acting, a bad script, bad direction, even bad editing. It is, to sum up, cack.The only vaguely impressive performance is by Danes. Stahl is distinctly mediocre and Schwarzenegger doesn't appear to be even trying. And someone should have pointed out to Loken that the reason Schwarzenegger and Patrick were so intimidating in the previous films was because they deadpanned while they were busy killing people. She needed to show less emotion and definitely quit the pouting.OK, it has its moments. The chase scene and the fight in the toilets are impressive, but will have you laughing out loud rather than on the edge of your seat. The action is more reminiscent of Tom and Jerry than anything else. As such, you can't take then ending seriously, not matter how hard it tries.Oh yeah, and they use the 'f' word twice in a 12a-rated film. Ooh, how rebellious.",Null,0,0,20 August 2003
Saving Private Ryan," Brilliant but slightly flawed war film
","There's a lot said about this film and most of it is completely justified. Steven Speilberg has made a new milestone in the portrayal of the horrors of war. The opening combat scene is probably the most graphic and moving battle scene ever with the final climactic skirmish taking second place. The film also contains some excellent character work which works so well in war films.However there were a few things for me that stopped this film short of being the best war film. Firstly was the blatant Americaness of the film; there was little or no reference to the Canadian and British troops that took part in the invasion. Also being British I find all the stars-and-stripes patriotism very cliched and tiresome.The biggest let-down I think was in private Ryan himself. Unlike the majority of the people in the film he seemed to be completely devoid of believable character. I found it disappointing to wait most of the film to see him and find that he had been plucked almost straight from the filmmaker's A-Z of likeable 20-year-olds.Still, the film was excellent. Hanks and Sizemore pulled off their parts brilliantly and the film had me and all my friends genuinely moved. I think that Schinder's List is still Speilberg's best so far though.",Null,0,1,18 January 1999
