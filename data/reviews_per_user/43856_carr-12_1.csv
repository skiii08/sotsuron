Howl's Moving Castle," Disappointed - the adaptation let it down
","I saw the film and then read the book.I wanted to get my head around the strange ideas in the film - most of which seem to have been bits added into the film for no real reason - why the battleships; why the planes; and why the scooter-planes?There were of course good bits in the film that were not in the book: for example, the Witch of the Waste and Sophie climbing the stairs of the palace. But how much did they add to the story?I'm not sure if I was missing something allegorical in the adaptation. May be I was, but then why take a excellent story and modify it if you want to communicate a personal message. Surely it would be better to write you own story.I'd watch the film again, well I did buy the DVD - but I think I'd prefer to read the book again as my first option.",5,4,9,18 April 2006
