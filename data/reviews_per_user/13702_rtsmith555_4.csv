National Treasure: Book of Secrets," NOT for Southerners
","Look...if you had relatives who fought in the Confederacy (as 1/2 of the country did) you'll probably get a little offended by some of the comments in this movie. They pretty much insinuate that anyone who was in the Confederate Army was a traitor.They also make the presumption that we will all identify with the main character's attempts at defending his great-grandfather's reputation against accusations that he was a Confederate sympathizer. This essentially is saying that anyone who is related to a Confederate soldier is dishonorable. Wow...that's a pretty big finger to point, but I won't get into politics here.If you're from the South, pass on it. It's that simple.",1,7,16,22 January 2008
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Terrible Film and Site Admins
","Wow...IMDb sure likes to protect their own beliefs and censor any dissenters. I've had two deleted reviews--one for this movie challenging the antagonistic portrayal of Southerners as 'racists' and one for 'Taking Woodstock' challenging the homosexual content. Nevermind that I read other reviews commending Abe Vamp for its accuracy (example below) or Woodstock for its 'courage.' With such controversial topics, shouldn't all opinions be valued in a free society? Oh, it must be 'hate speech' if it goes against your personal agenda.Comment from another reviewer about Abe Vamp: 'The Southern Confederacy, desiring to hold on to the last vestiges of gentility lest they get their white hands dirty, declared itself free from the Union in order to retain the right to own people as if they were property.' Reviewer goes on to insinuate that this is realistic. Southerners have always known better...ever since the war ended. Power vs. peasants...just the way it has always been.Please, ban me from this garbage dump.",1,2,12,6 August 2012
No Country for Old Men," Superb acting, OK storyline
","Tommy Lee Jones, as always, delivered a convincing portrayal of a 'Tommy Lee Jones'-character. Big surprise for me was Josh Brolin. Living in the South, my kinsmen and I always have a good laugh at those actors who attempt to pull off the Southern dialect. In the last few years, more and more actors are starting to get it down. Prior to that, it was pure comedy--almost like trying to get Brett Favre to pull off a British accent. Brolin, however, really delivered a convincing performance of someone you might actually run into in the South (Texas, more specifically).Call me old-fashioned, but I've had enough of the movies without any sort of closure at the end of the film. I can deal with the blur between protagonist and antagonist in some films, but this one really wasn't one of those. Good guys and bad guys were pretty clearly defined during the film from a traditional values perspective. I realize that in the real world the bad guys don't always pay for what they've done, but I'm going to the movies to escape the real world. I get enough of that on the news. Let me leave the theatre with a good feeling instead of feeling angry. There's nothing creative about stirring that emotion in film-making (or writing)...that's easy.Despite the ending, there were scenes that I loved and/or to which I could relate. One pivotal scene--defining the film title so vividly--was the one between Jones' character and that of Barry Corbin. If you're a Southern man, you may find as I did that this is perhaps the most definitive scene of your identity in the modern film era. This simple little scene alone made the film to me; otherwise, I'd have given it a 6.",7,0,2,22 January 2008
There Will Be Blood," I think I actually may have liked 'Meet the Spartans' better than this movie
","I was in the mood for a movie a couple of weeks ago, but had seen everything in the theatres. Reluctantly, I forced myself to go see 'Meet the Spartans,' and paid dearly for it. It took everything I had to stay until the end. It's one of the first comedies since the 80's that I have seen which did not manage to get a single smirk out of me. Hands down...the worst movie I've seen in years.That is, until I saw 'There Will Be Blood.' I've read through some of the positive posts on here highlighting the acting and cinematography and can see where some people might be split on these elements (personally, I wasn't impressed with either). Even if I did agree, however, I just don't think that these alone can carry a movie to a 9 or 10 rating. Some other reviewers on this site hit the nail on the head: this film was just plain boring.Literally, I could not wait for this to end. My wife and I were looking at one another in the theatre throwing our hands up in amazement every 30 minutes or so (2 1/2 hr. film) when the film's plot still hadn't gone anywhere. This is like a couple of snapshots in the life of some oil baron. Nothing really ever happens.Did we really have to wait 2 1/2 hrs. to see an out-of-place conclusion to the movie which turned out to be yet another Hollywood shot at religion? Really? C'mon...hasn't Hollywood's take on religion been thoroughly documented in every film made that touches on the subject? I get it already.What was there that could ever be mistaken as being inspiring or even entertaining in this film? If it weren't for the two or three scenes of bloodshed (mild at best) and some profanity, this is what I would put on TV to get my kids to sleep at night. I can only reason that the studio has hired tons of individuals to write positive reviews on this. Surely, IMDb users have better taste than this.Pass.",1,18,33,18 March 2008
