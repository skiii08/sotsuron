The Sound of Music," A feel good family classic- the best of all time
","This has got to be my all time favorite movie- i am not normally a huge movie fan, but this is just a timeless classic. Who couldn't fall in love with everything about this movie. Julie Andrews has an incredible voice, all the songs are not only great but have meaning behind them too. I am the same age as the daughter 'Marta' so I grew up with this movie and have seen it at least 50 times and could watch it again and again. Its one of those movies that makes you forget all your troubles and just an all around feel good movie. How many of us don't know practically all the words to the songs? I bet we can all sing them. (and were talking 40years here). By far, a movie that will live in our hearts(or at least mine) forever.",10,2,8,18 December 2005
