Howl's Moving Castle," The Heart
","I'm going through a sort of Miyazaki renaissance, in which this and 'Mononoke-hime' (1997) have played a major part. I think I'll have to visit 'Majo no takkyûbin' (1989) next to see if Miyazaki can turn my head around again. I don't tire of telling this over again: there's nothing as enlivening as returning to films and finding so much there that had gone unnoticed previously.And I thought that 'Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi' (2001) was the ultimate exploration of colour in Miyzaki's animation. How wrong was I! I can't believe, and couldn't believe, my eyes – every scene is so sumptuously and purposefully lit, allowing every detail bask in the glorious foreplay of light and shadow. The first five minutes are, as a sort of prelude, some greatly effective filmmaking: the beautifully detailed interiors, the everyday hustle and bustle of the townsfolk, the remarkable intimacy and homeliness of the narrow streets; the dank cloths, the oil lamps, the small, everyday objects laid to waste in the castle. But what makes Miyazaki's film come alive is the heart. The heart of the film is not captive, but rather bursts through and frees Calcifer through Sophie. His characters often tread the line between light and darkness, and other opposites: youth and old age, beauty and ugliness, good and evil, night and day, blessing and curse, war and peace, life and death, freedom and captivity. It's through these opposites that the film comes alive, the characters often a kind of white space to which he pours the contradictory sentiments, coalesced by the narrative thrust where the same forces battle it out on a larger scale.",9,0,1,1 June 2014
Gravity," A Masterclass
","This review will contain spoilers, and I really mean it. Not many new films get me pumped up, at least not as many as I would like. The last time I was this eager to go to the cinema was a few years back when I was able to see Béla Tarr's 'A torinói ló' (2011) and Terrence Malick's 'The Tree of Life' (2011), both on the same day, actually. Before that perhaps David Lynch's 'Inland Empire' (2006). I had read about Cuarón's ambitions, and considering 'Children of Men' (2006) is just as masterly as they say and wrestles with just the kind of filmic issues I'm fond of (space, length of sequences, movement of camera), why wouldn't I have been over the moon to see this?But really. After this first sequence of 17 minutes I was sold, and they could have done anything, and I mean anything, after that and I still would have had the time of my life. I have seen quite a few 3D films and never felt its use was cinematically necessary, but here it's more than justified, it's integral. The movement of the camera is gut-wrenching at times, and the sense of space is achieved through the use of 3D, not through gimmicks that emphasize the technology but through subtlety, often emphasizing the naturalness of the environment. I have a list of the most uplifting and lucid film moments, and that sequence has its place there.Not that the film goes downhill after that. On the contrary, it's a cinematic masterclass in entertaining and cinematically profound filmmaking, condensed in 90 minutes. The camera soars in space, becoming a third character. We become weightless. In contrast, when we finally arrive to Earth the camera stays down on the ground, only able to glance upward, unable to rise and soar as it did because of gravity. Is there a film where something so naturally mundane to us as gravity is lifted up from its everyday context and given fresh relevance?I think this makes a fine companion to Al Reinert's 'For All Mankind' (1989), a profound study of space, our insignificant yet beautifully meaningful part in this vast universe, the importance of achieving space travel, becoming acquainted with an unknown and thus fearsome yet grand and immensely breathtaking world, the feeling one might have when gazing upon the Earth as we gaze upon the moon from our planet. But space has no feelings for us. If we think of space in terms of its dangers, we often describe it as hostile. But it is not hostile, nor is it friendly. Space simply is. And that sense of loneliness and terror in helplessness is also grandly present in these films, as it should be. Of those of us who have ever thought about space and what it might feel like to be there, who hasn't also thought of how it might feel like when one is adrift, alone, facing the infinite-seeming blackness with no hope of return?",9,6,8,15 November 2013
12 Angry Men," Fireworks From Start to Finish
","There's some wonderful acting in Welles' 'Touch of Evil' (1958), especially between Heston and Welles. There the characters don't duly wait for space to say their lines, they're impatient, try to cut into the conversation and steal that moment or two in the flow of conversation they know they won't be granted otherwise.In this film Lumet goes as far one can go in this respect. The characters are no longer characterizations, they're real people, interacting with passion, conscious of their space not only in the room but in the conversational dimension, just like we are in real life.The cinematography corresponds to this intimacy. The air is full of emotion, presence. I often consider Dreyer's 'La passion de Jeanne d'Arc' (1928) as the ultimate close-up, but it might as well be this one. I have never felt having been transported to a place with such frenetic control, oxymoronically speaking. This is fireworks from start to finish. Then again, the cinematographer is one of the great masters of cinema. Consider that this is the man who shot all those amazing interiors in Vigo's 'L'Atalante' (1934), it's not entirely shocking that there's so many visually preternatural things transpiring. Moreover, here one may find the crème de la crème of any version of Sherlock Holmes ever made, a whodunit in which logic is overturned by logic, emotion by emotion, recollection by clarity. A wonderfully executed study of thought guided by prejudice and assumption and of thought guided by passion for lucidity. The Region A Blu-ray released by the Criterion Collection is great not only for having impeccable image quality but also for the brilliant extra material.",9,1,2,9 February 2013
The Great Dictator," The Joker and The Madman
","Chaplin's films are like the ocean. The surface seems calm and unaltered, yet a great shift is stirring up underneath, the surface changing only when the powerful undercurrent is in full swing.So it is that 'The Great Dictator' (1940) is a part of this sea-change that finds Chaplin on a path to the apotheosis I'd place in 'Limelight' (1952). No longer similarly spirited like Chaplin's earlier comedies, or the middle period of the late 1920s and 1930s, Chaplin is persistently moving toward a new kind of cinema already emerging in 'Modern Times' (1935).His transition to sound unquestionably had much to do with it. He had to let the Tramp go. Thus The Great Dictator marks a watershed in a filmography already brimming with turning points. I'd say this is where 'late Chaplin' truly begins, Modern Times being a kind of transitory film. And as I've stated, this is not only a superficial transformation but a deeper development also in what he perceives as cinematic, funny and tragic. Surely Chaplin's films have always had that sinuously sad and dark undersong, commingled with the more apparently comical, as he was himself quick to point out,[1] yet it finds its maturity in this later period.Seeing The Great Dictator after World War II and its aftermath is like reading James Joyce's Ulysses (1922) after almost a hundred years of literary criticism and analysis. It's so pregnant with cultural meaning(s) assigned to it that it's quite impossible to watch it not through the prism of history. But I think it's important to remember that this was filmed in the late 1930s, and as Chaplin would famously muse, he had no idea of the full extent of the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime against the jews and others.The film, then, stands in the anteroom to either history or fiction. Yet I can't help but see it as at its core as a kind of Chaplinesque fantasy, where the battle of good and evil is personified in the two doppelgängers.[2] The evil was not hard to find at all, yet neither was the good: it was the Tramp, of course, who, thanks to the advent of sound, is morphed into the Jewish barber.As such, The Great Dictator is a superb achievement. Its place in not only film history but world history actually works in its favor, accentuating the comedy with the tragic and the tragic with the comic. It's a work of precision, intelligence and, characteristic of Chaplin's genius, deep wisdom. Has there ever been a filmmaker who has understood us better than him? I think it's immensely useful to approach The Great Dictator as a dyadic exploration. On story level, there's the good versus evil contradistinction; technically there's the constant discourse between the silent and sound eras, which presents itself not only visually or in sounds, but also in how sound and what is seen become an integral element of the story, a kind of continuation of City Lights. Chaplin has such extensive fun on Hitler's expense in the public monologues that I wonder whether, in Michael Wood's words, 'he may in part be using speech to remind us of the beauties of silence.'[3] In the story there's some drastic and some very subtle use of undercranking, as befits 1910s, the silent era, the film starts with.[4] We're extremely lucky, by the way, to have the Criterion Collection putting these out on Blu-ray. Everything they've released so far from Chaplin has been immaculate.FOOTNOTES: [1] 'The Gold Rush' (1925), for example, was inspired by the Donner party tragedy, as recounted by Chaplin in 'Mr. Chaplin Answers His Critics,' from The New York Times, 27 October, 1940. On page 18 in the booklet for the Criterion Collection Blu-ray.[2] 'Just think,' Chaplin would say, 'he's the madman, I'm the comic. But it could have been the other way around.' In 'My Father, Charlie Chaplin' by Charles Chaplin, Jr.[3] Michael Wood, 'The Joker and the Madman,' on page 8 of the booklet for the Criterion Collection Blu-ray release.[4] As pointed out by Dan Kamin and Hooman Mehran in the audio commentary for the Criterion Collection edition.",9,1,3,31 December 2015
My Neighbor Totoro," The Magnificent Caphor Tree
","Similar to 'Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi' (2001) in premise and 'El espíritu de la colmena' (1973) in its depiction of childhood imagination, Miyazaki's 'Tonari no Totoro' (1988) succeeds in blending the Japanese folklore and warm childhood summer nostalgia, the unattainable freedom of youthful imagination and hope, and the fear of not only growing up but becoming overwhelmed by the worldly sorrows of the grown-ups.Full of the small, beautiful moments of family life: the bath, the bicycle ride (the dad resting in the grass while the girls eat), the possibility of the mother's death frames a deeply moving story of two children at a loss as to how to cope with the illness and absence of their mother. And they've also just moved house, as Sen had before going through the tunnel, which in this film leads further into the forest, to the magnificent Caphor tree.A great deal is made of that which exists but cannot be seen by the adults. The Susuwatari, the rustle of wind that in fact is something much more than mere wind, the rain that hides more on the darkening nightly road than an ordinary bus, the planted seeds that magically grow overnight; all this leads to the final emotional resolve, where the girls deliver an ear of corn on the windowsill of their mother's hospital room. In a sense, the whole film is all about this trip the children make, where the film tries to convince us that in that ear of corn not everything is as it seems.",8,0,1,1 June 2014
Barry Lyndon," Kubrick Paints With Light and Shadow
","Had Rembrandt made films in the 20th century, they could have looked and felt something like this. Natural light taken to its extreme, painterly mise-en-scène and colour, wildly riotous humour. Death. Indeed, each frame exudes audaciously utter compositional mastery, and Kubrick paints with light and shadow in ways quite unmatched, perhaps equalled only by the virtuosity of Malick and Lubezki's.Kubrick, to my mind, is a superb humanist, somewhat like Imamura, yet his sense of humour is more approachable. The visual gags of the film are brilliant and hilarious. The first part of the film is fireworks from beginning to end, and it's the second part where Kubrick is able to offer a cataclysmic counterpoint that is decidedly slow in its accretion, escalating from the high-flying superficiality of Barry's character and his lack of forethought for the consequences of his actions. Or, if you like, things just befall him without any dramatic sense of cause and consequence.'The Draughtsman's Contract' (1982) would be a fine place to go from here, since it's visually as painterly, made by a painter, influenced by another painter's notions.",9,2,4,27 January 2013
Full Metal Jacket," Difficult to Explain Why
","While this is as witty, visually stunning and well-crafted film as might be expected from Mr Kubrick, it does not rank that high in my books among other films from his filmography. This, of course, is highly suspect, and requires some explaining.And it is difficult to explain why. The film shuffles between different moods (farce, tragedy, psychological horror, destruction) and forms (fluid tracking shots, Tarkovskian wandering, documentary, hand-held chaos) so expertly it's a sign of great craftsmanship that it all holds together. Hartman is at the center of the farce, which then explodes at our face in the darkest scenes of the film, also the most heartbreaking (save for that one tracking shot of the mass grave). Then the film shifts gear again. The shot from above of the two dead soldiers is among the most accomplished I've found from Kubrick, the emblem of this film for me.Perhaps the reason why this doesn't enlarge itself with each viewing as 'Barry Lyndon' (1975) does lies in the confines it has set for itself. Hugely influential within the genre, it still largely operates within it, and in some ways enforces a certain Vietnam film archetype. My favourite 'war' films aren't war films in themselves, the war is there, but we are there for other reasons. Another reason might be its centrifugally moving narrative, yet I admit this lack of a nucleus might have been Kubrick's whole intention, since it leaves me wanting, quite disturbed, even. You are free to disagree, and I might agree this is rather oblique reasoning. On the other hand, my argument deals not why this film is bad, which it most certainly is not. Perhaps this is the one film I have been explicitly saturated with, in ways concealing its narrative and visual power. Maybe in due time when I revisit it again I'll be able to appreciate it more.",7,0,1,7 February 2013
The Passion of Joan of Arc," The Nerve, The Vision
","The  Masters of Cinema series released their long-awaited restoration of Dreyer's 'La passion de Jeanne d'Arc' (1928) on Blu-ray last November. It includes the 'Oslo print' in two different projection speeds, both 20fps and 24fps, as well as the 'Lo Duca' bastardization. Highly recommended not only for the beautiful 1080p presentation but also for the booklet that comes with it.It's been some 10 years since I last saw this, and intriguingly divergent films and memories have superseded Dreyer's film in the memory. I couldn't remember the stylized movement of the camera and the imaginative camera angles, and how they have likely inspired Eisenstein's 'Ivan Groznyi' (1944) and Welles' 'Othello' (1952). Dreyer's unflinching nerve, his clear vision, and the unity of that vision. Someone somewhere has called this the ultimate close-up, and it most certainly is. Nick Wrigley, formerly of the Masters of Cinema team, describes the release on Twitter as 'a magic death-defying fever dream. I can't imagine a luckier Blu-ray on earth. 20fps pure joy'. I really like the phrasing in 'death-defying fever dream'; this is exactly that, a fervent, dreamlike, atmospheric, never-consumed – much like his later masterpiece and for me his apotheosis, 'Vampyr' (1932), his subsequent film.And if you've never tried it, it's one of the most intimate experiences one can have, watching a silent film completely silent, without any music. I did this with the silent comedies of Ozu, released by the BFI on DVD, mainly because I didn't like the new scores they recorded for them. The experience is otherworldly.The 'Lo Duca' version now seems like a bad joke in its emotional manipulativeness. If you want to find out how to mistreat the beautiful passages of Bach and Albinoni, look no further and give the 'Lo Duca' a spin.I prefer the 20fps version, and I really have no interest in going back to 24fps unless for comparative purposes. It flows more naturally (to my eyes) and viewed silent has more flair to it (to my tastes).I'm looking forward to many high definition fever dreams to come.",9,2,4,5 January 2013
Spirited Away," The Other Twin
","I have seen very few films this year, and I mean very few. Not even a dozen films in four months. Three little children can do that to you, although I've been reading a lot, too. Since I try to write reviews only on films I've recently seen, and the few films I have seen haven't been up to much, this film was the one I turned to.I had glowing memories of this. Not only of its magic, both in the story and in the whole ambiance of the thing, but also its remarkable penetration of childhood imagination. Many powerful images remained in my mind, regardless that I hadn't seen the film since perhaps 10 years ago.Well, this is every bit as good as I remembered, perhaps even better. It's Alice in Wonderland, an animated fantasy version of 'Bakumatsu taiyôden' (1957). The apparently deserted spirit town more than reminds of 'Yôjinbô' (1961). There's the sense of a growing up story, of letting go of the past, and finding love, and friendship, and how people who consider them insignificant, can do great things and not be rewarded for them. Let's not forget Miyazaki's own 'Tonari no Totoro' (1988), either, which, at its core, is largely about the same thing.I like to see this both as real and a dream, where the dream extends itself to reality because Sen, or Chihiro, carries it over with her much like the little paper-spy sent by Yubaba. One last thing that captured my imagination. This is, in cinematic terms, an astounding celebration of the possibilities of animated colour, although 'Hauru no ugoku shiro' (2004) might go even further. Another delicious aspect is the beauty of the water. It's as if the colours themselves were characters, either humans or spirits giving life to the image, or, in the idiom of the film, giving the images their names and identity. It's the evil twin, the enemy of imagination, that takes them away. What is that enemy of imagination, if not to forget what it was to be a child?",9,0,1,1 June 2014
Lawrence of Arabia," There With Him
","Considering that our earthly wandering in its part consists of many rather obnoxious and disappointing film experiences, it's still so that even one blissful erases a hundred sour ones. These wonderful films, so much larger than life, it seems, that the disks they're stored on hardly contain them, ferocious as they are, make the heart beat faster.I've seen this quite a few times, and still it always puts me in my place as if I had somehow managed to unravel its secrets. Each time the journey is, as it is with the greatest of epic masterworks ('2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Profound Desires of the Gods' and their ilk) not only undiminished but even more powerful. Some of the images are so strong I'm not only carrying them with me but implementing them in my own life.And this only considering the visual narrative. This is, in other respects as well, perfect. The cinematography, music, script and dialogue, the ensemble acting, and, above all, O'Toole. He's so brilliant: Proustian in his self-reflexive fragility, flamboyantly sexy (more than Deloin at his most Deloin, or Bowie at his most Bowie).Please remember that film criticism offers subjective opinion as objective fact, and is more than anything an exercise in projected power. That said, this is so perfect it's hard not to be vague, not to lapse into paroxysms of emotion and say nothing at all. This might not be a bad thing in the end, however. One of the motifs in the film is the film is exactly this kind of otherworldliness and the disconnect between the two worlds: how can anyone in the film understand why Lawrence fell in love with the desert, and did the things he did, except for us, who were there with him?",9,1,3,16 November 2013
2001: A Space Odyssey," Possibilities
","I have just celebrated the visual and immersive storytelling of Malick and Caplin, so it's unsurprising that I'm arriving now at Kubrick's door.Among the most beautifully photographed and engineered poems, one does need some interest in the meditative languor or patience to wait foe the science fiction vision to unfold (although I think the film transcends all genres). For me, this is very much as spellbinding as films get, from the very beginning. I don't agree with the criticism that Kubrick might be pompous, but I can see why one might feel that way. This, even after all these years, is a journey into film itself, the possibilities of visual expression. And aural! What a way to use well-known pieces and make them one's own! Not to mention taking an obscure piece by Ligeti, letting it to get to the bone.From time to time I'm surprised by the criticism aimed at the acting of those involved. They are often described as wooden, and in comparison HAL seems humane. I'm surprised by this since isn't it obviously the point — that the great tragic struggle is not really fought within the humans but within HAL?",9,1,2,10 January 2014
Eyes Wide Shut," A World of Its Own
","I remember when Kubrick passed away. I read it in the morning newspaper, and was struck with deep sadness I couldn't explain. Mind you, I was not even 12 years old at the time and had barely seen any of his films. So I went to see 'Eyes Wide Shut' (1999) at the cinema. I credit it, along with Terrence Malick's 'The Thin Red Line' (1998), as an experience that ignited my interest in film, since they were both films like I had never seen before. Sure, there's that one reason why a young lad might be interested in this, but I was so struck by its atmosphere and narrative flow that I had to read Schnitzler's 'Traumnovelle'. And how disappointed I was in how unalike they were. The film was in a world of its own that had a sense of time that was its own, a sense of colour that was its own, a sense of light that was its own. Every movement was languid, every word deliberate.I never really thought about the connection between this and Malick's film until now, but really, they both move in the realm of dreams and memories and projected, subjective realities – between something that did happen (to someone) and something that might have happened. There's ellipsis, ambiguity, metaphor. Both work their magic in visual terms. I'm soaked in that light from the ball even by recalling the images in my mind as I'm writing this.Fidelio – enter.",8,19,28,21 February 2013
Three Colors: Blue," Music, Family and Death
","Kieslowski's 'Trois couleurs: Bleu' (1993) has been among my favourite films for as long as I can remember, yet it manages to surprise me with each viewing: it's so perfectly nuanced, emotionally heartbreaking and demanding, visually coherent and ipso fact perfect elaboration of film as art and art as something of value. The rest of the trilogy is just as mind-boggling in its brilliance, tenderly radical in its visual determination. But this! Nonpareil filmmaking only equaled in the past 20 years by Wong, Malick, Tarr and the Brothers Quay.Kieslowski sees beautifully: organically, rooted in true presence of not only the characters but us; us not only as observers but as participants. He does not only show but truly takes us there, not only refers to emotion but charges each image and sound abundantly with that which we may recognize in ourselves. Reciprocally, not patronizingly, so effortlessly.The smallest of objects become amplified in their significance, and this way Kieslowski and Tarkovsky are alike: the objects are given life much richer than what they usually are as simple décor. They are given memories and this makes them alive for us, since we can see them interface with the people inhabiting this lonely space.This film in particular speaks to me with such force because three things in particular it shares with me that I can share with it: music, family and death. All this in a work of art that exhibits powerful visual ingenuity and radical rethinking of the use of sound and image.",10,0,0,15 June 2013
Paths of Glory," The Absurdity of Life and Art
","I'm in the middle of revisiting most of Kubrick's work, and watching this after 'Full Metal Jacket' (1987) is a wonderful experience. Accidentally, I had also seen Kazan's 'On the Waterfront' (1954) just some days earlier, and that experience too gave a great deal of perspective and enhanced my enjoyment. All the sweeter since I saw this last some 10 years ago and wasn't as overwhelmed then.But now its strengths have really grown on me. There's the amazing, acute sense of movement in the camera, be it in the trenches or the encircling dancing in the interior shots of the Department. The claustrophobic sense of place, and the contrapuntal open, wide hallways and high ceilings of the courtroom. This is Kubrick at his best. And the sounds! Of explosions, machine-gun fire, breathing, the loud echoes of the cross-examination, the intimate singing of the German girl in the pub, revealed behind the wall of sound of obstinate cheering and drunken blabber. These counterpoints of both space (small, wide) and sound (loud, silent) define the film for me.Watching 'On the Waterfront' just before this was an interesting point of comparison. Brando and Kaufman's cinematography where the highlights of that film, but I couldn't really connect with the central social struggle at all, the bestiality of man toward man, man corrupted by power and prestige. Not so here – and here Kubrick's delicate sense of satire comes into play. Whilst a serious film, it doesn't take itself too seriously, which is exactly why it's able to connect with us the way it does. The absurdity of life and art, and of art trying to depict life (and art). How man is reduced to a mere number, a prop in a film. I found this very effective.",9,0,0,17 February 2013
Rear Window," Jeff's Room
","There's something about Hitchcock. Most of his films are fun for their craft and understanding of what works cinematically, but for me they are mostly one-time films. There's one exception, however, and that's 'Rear Window' (1954). Surprised you there, didn't I. 'Vertigo' (1958) I like, yes, and while much of it struck me equally as magical as before, the jaded ending spoiled it for me: it was too expository, somehow too clean.Here the ending is a bit too explanatory to my taste, and everything happens a bit too suddenly when things get going. But the amazing sequence of events that leads us there more than makes up for it. Much has been said about this film's voyeurism in the filmic sense: we gain emotional satisfaction when we are granted godlike access to other people's lives, be they real or fictional. This, however, is important in regards to a form of art that's so deeply all about us seeing things. Stewart plays a photographer and we're constantly reminded about his point of view — what did he see? Does what he saw really mean what he thinks it does? In other words, how does what we think we see relate to what we think is happening. In addition, the camera-eye is pretty marvelous: we stay the whole film in Jeff's room, in his point of view. Hitchcock devices it brilliantly: he's in a wheelchair so he can't move out, and neither can we. He uses surrogates, and they become our surrogates as well, meaning that effectively we become so close to Jeff as actually becoming him.Writing about it makes me want to see it again.",8,0,1,26 November 2013
The Thin Red Line," Shared Secret
","I didn't catch this at the cinemas, but I remember very well when it came out. I was 11 at the time, and would eventually see it the next year on video. That year I'll always recall with fondness, since then I also saw Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' (1999) at the cinema and also found Von Sternberg's 'Der Blaue Engel' (1930) at the local library. These three films, all seen in a relatively short period of time, launched me to the orbit, and I've never come down. Surely I had seen great films before them, but I credit these three for setting me to take on film as a hobby.I've seen the film again twice on the breathtaking Criterion Blu-ray during February, before that seeing it perhaps five or six years ago. So in some ways I've been reliving much of the amazement. Relishing, really. I'll do the unthinkable and quote myself, since when I wrote about Kubrick's film I came upon an idea that's valid here, too: 'I never really thought about the connection between 'Eyes Wide Shut' and Malick's film until now, but really, they both move in the realm of dreams and memories and projected, subjective realities – between something that did happen (to someone) and something that might have happened. There's ellipsis, ambiguity, metaphor. Both work their magic in visual terms.' Indeed, Malick's cinema is often seen as visual poetry, and no matter what one might think of the term, Malick's films can be appreciated very much in this mode, mindset. Not only the craft, which is apparent, but the soul, too. He does require patience and willingness, but very much like Tarkovsky (sometimes ever more than!), the way he allows us into a very personal vision becomes a kind of shared secret. And this kind of romance is the best way I know to remember any film, and by 'remember' I mean to love and to live, and to live again.",9,2,3,11 April 2013
Princess Mononoke," Not Devoid of Hope
","I know you'll probably never trust anything I say ever again, but I didn't care about 'Mononoke- hime' (1997) when I first saw it some ten years ago. I have been, however, on a stroll through Miyazaki's body of work, and I've finally arrived at the princess's domain again.And all I can say is it's nice to be able to change one's mind. The beginning is fervent, echoing both the Narayama legend and King Lear, the former in the strictures of village laws, the latter in its apocalyptic hopelessness: 'this world is a curse' and 'life is suffering and pain' could be something uttered by the great old king, wearing his crown of weeds. Without question, then, this complements wonderfully not only Shakespeare but Kurosawa's 'Ran' (1985), as well, with which it shares the epic of hopelessness. But Miyazaki's film is not devoid of hope altogether. The violence is cruel, the action aggressive and sudden, the sense of death billows over the green meadows. Yet the love burns, the strong impulse to do what's right overpowers, and through death there is life.The last thirty minutes are among the most exhilarating moments of animation I've seen, the sense of crescendo and climax so overpowering it's as if the whole film is about to crumble in its wake. There are small moments of anticipation, details that contain the whole story (the dripping blood at the gate, the bone at the bottom of the lake, the first drops of rain), and they find their counterpoint in the utterly uncontrollable jolt of the resolution. The pond itself is a magical place, cinematically speaking, and the Deer Good exhibits just the right kind of ambivalence. I'm not a person to throw around monikers, but this is powerful cinema in all respects.The name of the film is of interest. The word 'mononoke' is a general term that means 'a spirit' or 'a monster'. Thus it's not the name of the princess, as in the English translation 'Princess Mononoke', but rather has the meaning that's close to 'spirit-princess'. Neither human nor animal.",9,0,1,1 June 2014
