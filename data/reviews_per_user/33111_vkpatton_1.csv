The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Simply Entertaining For Those Who Love The Story
","As a grown woman with many life experience years behind me, I fell in love with the books and I really like the movies. Breaking Dawn, pt.1, delivered for me. I have come to love the actors who portray the beloved characters. The movie was very entertaining and I plan to see it again. Was it perfect, no. Could it have been better, maybe. Did it satisfy me, yes. Did the director and actors translate the book to film, I think so. Am I going to waste on second tearing any part of it down, no. It is an escape. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I laughed at times, I cried during the wedding scene, and I held my breath during the sex scene. I eagerly await the final film and will be sad when it's over. Kudos guys, you did well.",6,9,17,19 November 2011
