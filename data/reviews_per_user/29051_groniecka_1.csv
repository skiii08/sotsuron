The Ring," one of the more funiest movies than i've seen
",I see firstly (thanks Gods) Ringu the masterpiece of the Japanese movies. Today few years later I see at TV the American remake and I don't know if I laugh or if I cry. It's one of the most funiest remakes of an horror movies than I've never seen (and I see more than 9.500 movies in my life).The conducting line is good but the americanization of the movie is ridiculous and gore without reasons.I regret the American movies who makes so many masterpieces of the movies can do some ridiculous remakes of movies of others country perhaps because the American movies lost imagination ?,Null,0,1,20 September 2004
