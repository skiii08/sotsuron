The Equalizer," A nice vigilante story – with a ton of brutal violence though
","Sentimental vigilante finds his calling in wiping out the mafiaOne man who is able to level an entire gang, it seems to good to be true, but Denzel Washington makes it happen. This movie gives us the hope that justice will prevail, albeit making some messy hands on the way. The movie has a good gloomy vibe, good dialogue and nice acting, but has so much killing in it that one wanders who holds the title of good guy in the end.Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) seems to be a regular guy, just suffering from some insomnia. He leads his life in Boston, working a daytime job at Home Mart and reading at a diner at night. Everything changes when Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz), an escort who also visits his diner and a friend, is beaten up by her pimp. This is the trigger that wakes up the vigilante in McCall. At first McCall tries to buy off Teri's freedom from the Russian gangsters that run the escort service, but when this appears to be impossible, he kills all five gangsters in he room where the meeting takes place. Here he uses some great combat skills resulting from his past as a CIA-agent. What follows is a manhunt on McCall, in which the Russian mob does everything in their power to find him. The scene where mobster Teddy (Martin Csokas, know for playing Celeborn in The Lord of The Rings Trilogy) visits McCall at his house is a highlight in the movie. It has subtlety, suspense and great acting by both lead actors. If only this movie had more of that. On the whole, one can say that the character of Teddy is a bit overdone. An action movie needs a distinct antagonist, but making him a psychopath is not enough. McCall states his motivation for his fight against injustice during his stay at the house of former CIA- colleague Susan Plummer (played by Melissa Leo). He explains that someday something terrible was done to someone who didn't deserve it, and he wanted to do something about it. Here we see a glimpse of McCall's history at the CIA, though this isn't scrutinized any further. It all comes down to McCall's coworkers being held hostage, which ends up in a big killing finale. This scene – nicely staged in Home Mart – shows us how the Russian mafia is getting what's coming to them. McCall kills them to the last man, sometimes brutally, which put question marks to him being solely a vigilante, and not a sadistic killer. But at least Teri is free now.What is great about this movie is Denzel Washington's acting, as a regular Joe and as a mob slayer. He is a sentimental man with a good heart, but he goes to extremes to fight injustice. The fact that the character of Robert McCall remains sketchy (he hates injustice period) is a pity. Furthermore, the director seems to want to give us mind-blowing images of explosions and brutal fighting scenes, but the fun in this movie is actually in the subtle scenes and the play between actors (especially Washington, Grace-Moretz and Csokas). All put together it is a better than average action movie that is worth your time and money, only with a sleight bit of overkill. The storyline is nice, and the actors do their best to make it a good movie, though it isn't a brilliant one.",6,1,7,1 October 2014
Spectre," The Newest Return to the Old Bond - Exciting, but not satisfying story wise
","The Newest Return to the Old BondThe dead are alive. The captions in the first minute of Spectre. An note at the Mexican Día de los Muertos – the beautiful opening of Spectre – but also a threatening indication of the events to come. Which is not fulfilled as chillingly as it might be. The beginning of this movie (everything before the opening song) takes you in with its superb beauty and thrills. Mexico City and the parade of skeletons make a great scene for a nice action opening. On ground level, atop buildings and taking to the sky. So far everything is cool. But a few minutes after the song, Bond is revealed to have been complying with a last request of an old friend, and we are dragged into a plot that is outrageous and far-fetched. Everything Bond has been through (since his reboot with 2006 Casino Royale), has a connecting to the events in this movie. But one might wonder why. Isn't Spectre as it is revealed in the film an evil enough organisation by itself? It adds nothing in creepiness that Bond (as said in the trailer) came across his enemy Franz Oberhauser so many times in the past, without knowing it was him. Skyfall (2012) was a grand, plot driven, mysterious movie. Spectre wants to be that too, but it shouldn't. A lot of times one is thinking about how little sense the events in this movie make. And that is not a good thing. Don't get me wrong, the action with planes, cars, and the robust Dave Bautista looks very good. Almost every scene is visually exciting, which makes up for quite a bit. But the feeling I got from this movie after seeing it was more or less a Roger Moore movie that wanted to be Skyfall so badly, but failed. Nevertheless, all actors are doing fine jobs. Léa Seydoux is convincing, although her character comes off as the good old helpless Bond girl. Christoph Waltz also delivers, but his characters fault is, that after an overwhelming entrance, he becomes this typical baddie that needlessly makes some convenient mistakes. Ralph Fiennes' M actually steals the show at some points, on another battlefield than Bond. Spectre borrows from the old Bond movies' comical and over the top action, which is okay if that is your thing. But going back to Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall story wise is absurd, in that it makes the villains in those movies look like nothing more than paws. And didn't Quantum of Solace do this exact same thing? Le Chiffre in Casino Royale (played thrillingly by Mads Mikkelsen), turned out to be just a small part of the bigger organisation Solace. Make up your mind what villain organisation you belong to, villains! All in all Spectre is worth watching. Not just because everybody has watched it and you have to as well, but because it is entertaining. But it isn't a return to the story quality of Skyfall, and it's not the most they could have made out of it.",6,2,7,12 November 2015
