Hereditary," This film is bad.
",This movie is total garbage. You could literally cut out two hours and tell this story in the leftover seven minutes as a short film. Thiz is the slowest moving story I have ever seen. All the great reviews on here have to be a hoax. There is no way you could rate this higher than two or three stars. I'm so glad I didn't waste money to sit through this film. I'm giving it a one because zero isn't possible.,1,2,8,22 August 2018
