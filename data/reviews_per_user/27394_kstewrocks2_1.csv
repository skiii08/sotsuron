The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," The BEST one yet ! Amazing
","The Twilight Saga is a huge franchise , and not to mention , an awesome series ( the books ) but the movies sucked Twilight and new moon were awful and eclipse was OK but a disgrace to the book , Breaking Dawn is not the best book of the series but to be honest Breaking Dawn part 1 is the best movie out of the whole series . 1-the movie was emotional and romantic for the first time 2- Bella's character has changed 3- there're different Enemies in Breaking Dawn 4- There're a chemistry between the main characters 5-the acting is very different and Enticing 6-interesting lines 7-the kiss scenes between Bella and Edward are brilliant 8-the characters in 'Breaking Dawn' have personalities 9-the soundtracks are very beautiful 10-The characters aren't perfect therefore it is much easier to relate to them but i really can't understand why this movie is PG-13 .. anyways this movie deserves an Oscar",10,44,104,1 November 2011
