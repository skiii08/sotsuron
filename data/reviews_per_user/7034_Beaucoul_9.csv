The Hangover," Evoked more anger than laughs
","Probably the worst picture of the year for me in terms of disappointed expectations. I didn't laugh once during the entire length of this so-called comedy. Witless, charmless, without one likable character in its ensemble cast, I was especially dumbfounded by the hype accorded to Zach Galifianakis, whose lack of talent somehow manages to make Adam Sandler look like a comic genius.'The Hangover' is obviously targeted to an audience who likes their humor broad and sophomoric. To make matters worse, it relies heavily on obnoxious stereotypes that are patently offensive.This piece of dreck utterly pales in comparison to a similar buddy flick, the eminently watchable 'I Love You, Man.' 'The Hangover' was an utter waste of time and money. Caveat emptor.",1,15,31,4 February 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Let my people go
","Another juvenile revenge fantasy brought to you by the master of the genre. Mr. Tarantino knows his demographic well, and he plays to it expertly here. Just as Ronald Reagan was directly responsible for the 'dumbing down' of American political discourse, so too has QT taken on the responsibility for the dumbing down of American cinema.Brad Pitt provides some unintentional laughs in the lead role of Lt. Aldo Raine. His hill-country accent is never believable. A descendant of American Indians, Raine is of course, the right man for the job. Especially the part about taking Nazi scalps. Ah, QT. You are certainly an equal opportunity offender.Which brings to mind how uneasy I am about Mr. Tarantino taking on the mantle of filmmaker as fantasy avenger for the Jewish people. The holocaust and Nazi atrocities are not exactly the most apt sources for a farce such as this. I'm reminded of Roberto Benigni's 'Life is Beautiful,' another misguided attempt at mining humor from a situation that was an abject nightmare for any and all of its unfortunate participants.There are one or two set pieces that demonstrate Mr. Tarantino's skill at developing a well-realized scene. But overall, the effect is mind-numbingly sensational, and then, quickly forgettable. The movie is like a bad dream, whose bits and pieces you're unable to reconstruct into a cohesive whole. My greatest fear is that this piece of revisionist history will be remembered by its legion of youthful Tarantino enthusiasts as the way things actually went down. Thanks for nothing, QT.",5,7,13,12 February 2010
"Monsters, Inc."," Majorly disappointing
","Wow. I was jacked to watch this movie with my grandkids. I thought it might be another Shrek, which we have all watched together numerous times. Shrek is clever and densely packed with humorous details such as the parking lot sign that states, 'You are parked in Sir Lancelot.' This movie however, is so un-clever, so artless, and so derivative, that it is offensive to me purely on an aesthetic basis. But my dislike of this movie doesn't simply stop there.Admittedly, I am no big fan of Billy Crystal, whose character is supposed to supply the film with most of its comic moments. Unfortunately, the character has no identity other than Billy Crystal doing his shtick.John Goodman's character fares no better. Imagine, taking a butt-ugly, terrifying monster and emasculating it in order to provide some touchy-feely revelation about the importance of positive reinforcement, and you get a grasp of just how low this movie will stoop to pander to its audience.Perhaps the worst offense of all is that this is a comedy without laughs. Secondary characters are mindless oafs, drawn in such lazy, broad strokes that it is almost offensive to be asked to laugh at them. Most of the comic scenes fall flat, primarily because they are so derivative, you know what to expect before the punch line arrives.What a let-down from Pixar, the studio that produced the great Toy Story movies. I'd like to think the blame for this mess can be fixed on the gross and retrograde hand of Pixar's parent studio, Disney. Pray that Pixar throws free the shackles on its next animated production.",Null,0,1,19 September 2002
Judgment at Nuremberg," Would a film of that candor have a chance of being made today?
","I watched 'Judgment at Nuremburg' on PBS the other night. I had never seen it before. I expected an empty-headed, Hollywood-style, quasi-melodrama, but I was pleasantly surprised. Even Spencer Tracy, that universally beloved actor whose appeal has always escaped me, gave an honest and heartfelt portrayal of a 'simple man' who was also a deeply conflicted judge.What I liked most about this movie was that it didn't pull any punches, in the manner of other 'controversial' films of its time. The defense attorney, superbly played by Maximilian Schell, weaves a simple, but undeniable web of logic: <ul><li>Sterilization of 'undesirables,' one of the charges against the Nazi war criminals, was at one time condoned by the U.S. courts, and encouraged by none other than Oliver Wendell Holmes. - Numerous leading industrialists in the U.S. contributed to the development of the Nazi war machine. - Encouragement was given to Hitler's expansionism by both Russia and England. - Churchill is quoted as having admired Hitler. - The Vatican actively collaborated with the Nazis.</li></ul>Correct me if I'm wrong, but it must have taken major cojones to present that kind of message to American filmgoers in 1961. Would a film of that candor have a chance of being made today?I tend to doubt it. One further note. The film describes how the Nazis went about stripping the German judiciary of judges who were known for their objectivity, and replacing them with judges who were appointed based solely on their party loyalties.The mind boggles at the implications and yes, the prescience of this well-written, well-played masterpiece.",9,68,79,30 April 2007
The Hurt Locker," The hurl locker
","I saw 'Hurt Locker' the other night and thought it was a major disappointment. I'm not sure what the hype is all about. The movie tells the story of a war lover. It's a story that's been told a thousand times before, but in much more effective ways.In addition, I would call this the worst kind of war porn. Much of the action made no sense, and more importantly, was militarily inaccurate. And I say this strictly from a civilian's perspective. I could tell when I was watching it that the action didn't ring true. It was only afterwards, when I sat down to read some of the reviews written by combat veterans that I had my suspicions confirmed. This movie is FUBAR.I can't help but feel that most of the hype generated about this movie stems from the fact that this was an action flick directed by a woman. Sorry Ms. Bigelow, you won't get that kind of pass from me. You're confined to quarters.",1,62,119,5 February 2010
The Dark Knight," Are you all out of your minds?
","This movie is overlong by at least a half hour. I am so tired of films that have about six or seven endings. It's become a bit of a cliché. Just when you thought it was safe to get up from your seat and start filing out of the theater, another epilogue begins and you're forced to sit through at least another ten minutes of ridiculous, overblown, pretentious blather that's been well-covered in the previous four or five epilogues. Some writer/directors just don't know when to say when, and that's usually a sign that they don't have confidence in their material, nor their approach to it. This movie is a prime example of that kind of narrative drawback. But that's just the beginning of my complaints about 'The Dark Knight.' Loud, obnoxious, puerile, without one whit of wit, this movie also represents the extreme destructiveness of a relentless hype machine that's intent on whittling down our collective sense and sensibilities. The acting, which ranges from wooden to hyperbolic, seems as if it's being carried out by inter-planetary aliens who have no idea what it's like to be human. The script sounds as if it was written by someone who barely made it out of bone-head, freshman composition. I've never heard or seen so many clichés strung together in a misguided attempt at profundity and universality. As each new, cliché-ridden set piece followed another, I began to feel beaten down, as if my defenses against such obvious manipulation were being fed upon by my own desire to enjoy what everyone else seemed to be accepting so readily. Fortunately, my will to survive such cultural mediocrity is strong, and I was able to withstand this latest onslaught with my dignity intact.Please understand, I enjoyed 'Batman Begins,' a story that was told in a simple, straightforward manner, with some minor attempts at profundity that were in line with the childish, comic book subject matter. To try and make something so 'de profundis' about a superhero running around in a bat costume chasing down some uber-villain in grease paint and fright wig, is truly akin to putting lipstick on a pig. After it's done, you can't help but wonder: 'are they really expecting people to take this crapola so seriously?' I'd rather see Adam West and Cesar Romero go at it, then have to sit through this load of pretentious, horse manure. At least I was able to get a laugh out of the original TV series, which was undeniably a camp classic in its original incarnation.",1,56,168,20 July 2008
Avatar," The 'king of the world' has no clothes
","I'm going to predict, and I don't think I'm going out on a limb here, that 'Avatar' will win in most of the categories for which it has been nominated.The supreme irony is that this film is, at its core, an exercise in gross hypocrisy. Anti-military, it revels in its depiction of violence as a means of resolving conflict; anti-corporate, its director is as venal and egotistical as any of the worst of the Wall St. CEOs; and anti-technology, it relies on its technological achievements to the detriment of essential film aesthetics like clever dialog, compelling plotting, and three-dimensional character development.I wasn't even all that impressed with the technical aspects. (I saw it in IMAX 3-D.) The visuals weren't all that different, or that much of an improvement, from some of the great PC and console games I've played in the past.Juvenile and derivative, this movie may arguably be a great leap forward in film technology, but it's a huge step backward for the concept of 'film as art.' Morally and aesthetically bankrupt, the film moves from one predictable plot point to the next, presenting elaborate and overblown set pieces that are unintentionally risible. When the movie reached its climax, depicting its alien race chanting and dancing in front of a sacred tree, I couldn't help but recall a similar masterpiece, 'Queen of Outer Space.' At least that movie had the benefit of a high-camp performance by Zsa Zsa Gabor. The only camp this movie can lay claim to is 'sleep-away.'Craptacular to the extreme.",1,16,29,4 February 2010
Sin City," The Mainstreaming of Gratuitous, Sadistic Violence
","'Sin City' is a flawless on screen realization of a graphic novel. If you allow yourself to be immersed, you could swear you're watching a comic book come to life on the silver screen. Characters are either monstrously hideous or impossibly gifted. The women in particular, accurately represent the febrile fantasies of adolescent and post-adolescent males. Buxom, statuesque, gun-totin' ass-kickers, they'd just as soon snap some slob's neck as wrap their legs around it.I have to admit, I was immersed in this movie from beginning to end. I can recognize something new when I've seen it, and this movie is definitely not like anything I've seen before. A movie will score points with me just on that basis alone. However, not being a big fan of graphic novels, I doubt I'd be interested in seeing another film like it. As with most graphic novels, the dialogue in the film, recreated faithfully, tends toward tough guy/gal patter, which, with its inherent limitations, can get old fairly quickly. Most of the plots in these novels tend to be based on revenge fantasies (certainly the prime motivator in 'Sin City'), and I tend to think (wish?) that the well-adjusted of us typically grow out of the need for that kind of bloody retribution when we exit our teens.On a side note, there are those who have taken exception to the way in which women are presented in this movie. They probably have every right. However, bear in mind that this movie represents the mainstreaming of a sadistically violent mindset traditionally limited to a coterie of readers of graphic novels. That mindset allows for a graphical realization of all manner of horrific transgressions that probably make the transgression of misogyny seem relatively tame in comparison. Perhaps a more relevant issue raised by this movie would be to ask why we are seeing the mainstreaming of this type of sadistic and retributive mindset at this point in our history.Finally, as a counter to the feminist outcry this movie has engendered, there has been some ameliorative talk as to how the hookers, exotic dancers, and waitresses in 'Sin City' are all 'empowered' women, as if this could somehow offset the fact that almost all of the women portrayed in the film are hookers, exotic dancers, and waitresses, with nary a PhD in Marine Biology among them. Feminists should not go to this movie unless their idea of feminism is getting him before he gets you.Somehow, this film feels post-apocalyptic. If you can get into that mindset, enjoy the ride.",5,11,22,13 May 2005
The Social Network," Lullaby of nerdland
","I wasn't all that impressed with 'The Social Network.' I didn't buy the whip-smart dialog and the rapid-fire conversations. I thought the script was way too showy, and too clever by half. I've heard Mark Zuckerberg speak. He's not that articulate and he is definitely not that spontaneous. I also tend to believe that his characterization, while unflattering, was very likely not unflattering enough.More incredulously, the movie portrayed him and those around him as cool geniuses, untouchable by us mere mortals. Indeed, it presented the high-tech milieu as if it was an endless array of wild parties and ecstasy-fueled dance raves. Nothing could be further from the truth. I think you would get a more accurate depiction of Silicon Valley life from watching 'The Revenge of the Nerds,' for what it's worth.Some high marks for the score and the cinematography are in order, and the pacing and direction are competent enough. It will be interesting to see what happens to this movie, once the level of interest in Facebook subsides, and the next big thing in cyberspace comes along. My sense is that it will be seen as nothing more than a dated artifact whose once great significance will seem quite mysterious to future audiences.",2,6,11,6 March 2011
