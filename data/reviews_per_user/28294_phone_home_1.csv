E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Beautiful Memory
","This movie was so beautiful. It was innocent, it was charming, and it was like the only movie then or since that has had an Alien character that ACTED instead of just killed humans or was like an insect. There was a movie with Louis Gosset Jr. and Dennis Quaid that was also good.But this movie brought us Drew Barrymore! She has been such an amazing actress over the years, getting more beautiful all the time. She was so cute in this movie and I totally had a crush on Harry when he played her brother.I hear that Spielberg has changed this movie and taken out guns and the word 'terrorist' which I guess is OK. But why did he then make dark and scary movies about terrorists? That doesn't make sense to me. It's so sad that War of the Worlds is how he feels about aliens now. I liked it better when it was E.T.:c)",10,1,2,30 January 2006
