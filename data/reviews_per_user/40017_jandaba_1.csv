The Blair Witch Project," An excellent concept that doesn't work
","One thing is obvious about this movie, even after several minutes of watching: it lacks special effects, all kinds of em. Which is a good thing, if you ask me, because movies that rely on visuals and/or sound tend do be crap, as demonstrated by the year of 2005. The concept behind BWP, however, is to make the viewer's imagination compensate for the aforementioned lack of effects. And indeed, a well-developed imagination surely is much more effective then the potential of all the animators, composers, choreographers, etc. of Hollywood put together. However, all this is somehow very poorly realized in the movie. Not creepy at all, imho. I personally had a feeling similar to watching the Animal Planet on mantis mating.So out of 10 possible points, I give 5/5 for an original and very interesting, as well as ambitious concept behind the movie; and 0/5 for the actual rendition, which was dreadful.",5,0,1,21 December 2005
