The Blair Witch Project," Interesting idea, not sure it's up to the hype.
","I've seen it twice now, and both times the audience booed at the end. Mostly young kids who probably shouldn't have been allowed in to see it in the first place.  I only felt real fear at 2 points which I won't give away in the film.  I found it more an interesting oddity than a ground breaking film.  Also be aware that if your prone to motion sickness the film might have an effect on you.  I left feeling queasy both times.JRG",Null,0,1,4 August 1999
