The Double Life of Véronique," More than cinema: pure poetry
","There is something magic about Kieslowski 's cinema: his ability to expose the beauty and complexity of the human soul on celluloid print.
This is perhaps his most intimate and touching movie, an authentic classic masterpiece.
The double life of Veronique tells the story of two identical women living separate lifes in Poland and France. The furtive encounter between Weronica and Veronique triggers a meditation on life, destiny and the pursuit of love. 
Love scenes are shot with unique sensuality and delicacy (at times through a magnifying glass). No other director has been able to capture the essence and fragility of women the way Kieslowski does it here - with her etheral beautiful muse Irène Jacob.
This film will fill your soul and mind like very few others.",10,2,3,14 October 2018
The Thin Red Line," The deepest war film ever made
","Terrence Mallick's The Thin Red Line is like no other war epic.Freely shot and edited it does not follow the classical 3acts plot line.The purpose of the movie is to take the viewer on a free dive, whose immersion allows us to meditate on the philosophical aspects of war.War is a affront made to humans themselves but also to nature and the divine.Soldiers are seen acting like soldiers but we have access to their mind and deep thoughts (through their voices off) which allows an extraordinary cinematic experience. Beautifully shot in vivid 35mm colour, The Thin Red Line is a classic masterpiece that will live forever.",10,2,5,15 October 2018
