The Ring," Like this one a lot but why is it Cert PG ???
",I just sat through a screener of The Ring. Being a horror fan i was looking forward to a blood and guts terror ride. It never really came about but the film leaves the viewers imagination to do the rest. Yes plenty of jumpy scenes and and a fairly good story line. I have heard this is going to be a PG big mistake. if thats the case there are going to be a lot of scared young kids with messed up heads in the near future. All in all its probably the best horror of the year and beats One Hour Photo and the like hands down.,7,0,0,2 January 2003
Hereditary," Utter Dross
","Quite simply one of the worst films i have ever seen. The first hour was slow and then began getting better. However, the last 30 mins is an utter joke and left the audience in my cinema laughing out loud. If it wasnt for the fact that i was at the end of a row I would have left the cinema midway",1,4,8,27 June 2018
Cloverfield," A Pile Of Poo
",Just got back from seeing this on the opening night.I found the camera technique very annoying and it gave me a headache throughout. Not knowing what the thing is and not know what happened atthe end really spoiled it. There were some good moments but all in all i have to say a film like this just doesn't work when filmed as it was.IT could have been superb as it was like Godzilla but with attitude.Nobody cheered or clapped at the end which is rare for a new opening action movie in the states. I wouldn't bother going to see it to be honest.Some good things though. Beth is hot in the film and I like he little creature things that chasedthem but all in all not impressed and the hype wasn't lived up to,4,9,18,18 January 2008
"Monsters, Inc."," What A Classic
",Having just watched a screener of this movie it has to be the best animated film i have seen.The graphics are amazing and little Boo's actions are near on perfect to a little child her age. My boy loved it and i found myself drawn into a great plot and excellent characters.This ones gonna make a pile of money and quite right to. Move out the way Harry Potter this is much more fun.....!!!,Null,0,1,13 November 2001
Radio," Suprised It was better Than I Thought
",Watched this last night and had a very bad feeling it was gonna be a girly movie and I would be asleep in minutes. Well i must say I stayed awake throughout and was glad I did. Cuba Gooding is brilliant as the mocked Radio and Ed Harris supports superbly as always. Fair to say if you wanna good weep then be ready to get plenty of tissues if my missus is anything to go by.,7,0,0,17 January 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Quality Stuff & Great Effects
","Just sat though T3 and I was pleasantly suprised. The storyline actually works and I liked the idea of a female Robot. The special effects are amazing and Arnie is back to his best... This one has a bit more humour in it than the others but it doesnt detract from the film...
My rating 8/10 quality stuff",7,0,0,18 July 2003
Dreamgirls," A Mans Point Of View
","The sound of music, Evita, A Chorus Line god I hate these films. My wife insisted I spend some 'Quality' time with her on the sofa and slipped in DreamGirls. My 1st thoughts before it came on... I want to be down the pub..... However to my surprise within 10 mins of the film starting I was loving it. Jennifer Hudsons voice was awesome and totally blew Beyonce away deserving her Oscar win for this performance. Eddie Murphy & Jamie Fox also supply some slick performances especially Eddie as as James Thunder Early. The soundtrack in my opinion was superb and when turned up through the surround sound had my feet tapping 'I obviously didn't show the wife I was doing this'7/10 for me and a great watch with some great songs though I told the wife is was a pile of rubbish of course.",7,1,3,3 May 2007
Resident Evil," Your Gonna Love This
","Not being a fan of computer game films i thought this would be your typical rubbish. How wrong can you be. From start to finish except for a couple of weird bits this film rocks. 
Great special effects and a not bad story line keep you glued to the screen all the way through. I recommend this to everyone. Check out the bit in the computer room with the laser beams.......",Null,0,0,20 March 2002
Transformers," Totally Awesome Effects
",Am working in NY for a while so jumped at the chance to watch transformers on July 4th. I really wasn't sure what to expect as I am getting pretty sick of CGI based stuff.This film on the other hand was awesome. The 2hrs it ran for felt like 10 mins. The special effects are just jaw dropping and myself and the eager watchers all stood up at the end and gave it a massive round of applause. The acting and story are good but really in 35 yrs I have never seen special effects as good as this. The robots seemed so real and the chase scenes are amazing.Hats of to Michael Bay because this is going to be HUGE when it comes over to the UK. Take your kids and enjoy every minute.,9,1,4,9 July 2007
From Hell," Star Filled Slasher.
",IF you like your films bloody this is for you. A good selection of well known UK and American actors provide an all together ok movie. Dont expect to be jumping out of your seats of anything but you need to watch carefully as you might lose the plot in places.The story of Jack the ripper is well known and there are some good twists in the story. Its a bit slow in places but some good throat slashing makes up for that.This is a video film rather than cinema personally but each to there own .,6,1,2,18 March 2002
Signs," The Only Sign you will want to see is the fire exit
","Caught this one on import over the weekend and what a let down. I loved 6th Sense and thought Unbreakable was ok but this had pottential.
After seeing the trailor for Signs (Its very Good) i couldn't wait to see it. After 30 mins i couldn't wait to turn the thing off. It was only my wife's love of Mel Gibson that kept it on the TV.The film had pottential and i thought something must happen that will amaze me but no. The only amazement was how they employed their costume dept to produce a spandex lycra alien outfit. Dear ohh Dear get me out of here and the ending must be one of the worst i have ever seen. I think the budget must have come from Mars as well because nothing was spent on this pile of Cr*p......Come on Mel get your Lethal Weapon head back on ......",5,1,1,29 July 2002
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Like Pulling Teeth
","Well i know these reviews are just peoples opinions but i really do fail to see how anyone can rate this movie more than 2. In 35 yrs of watching films this had to be one of the worst films i have ever seen alongside Strictly Ballroom. Oh my god just painful. I watched all of it though gritted teeth as the pain grew worse and really wanted to turn it off but i never have done in my life so didn't want to break the mold. Do yourself a favour. Stick some matchsticks under your nails or take some laxatives tablets by the dozen. You will have a much better time.Just one point to note the only funny bit in the film it ricky's 2 kids who made me smile instead of wanna cry. They were the rudest, crudest kids ever.",1,3,7,15 January 2007
