Lucky Number Slevin," From beginning to end just brilliantly executed...
","A movie I first saw upon its release early last year, but one I've managed to once again view thanks to the brilliance that is the DVD. If you've yet to see this little gem I suggest you do, immediately, as it was certainly one of the most enjoyable films I had the pleasure of watching in 2006.Super performances (particularly Hartnett, Lui and Kingsly), great and initially slow burning plot and intriguing character interaction (the Hartnett Lui chemistry was palpable, surprising and came across, most importantly, as completely natural and 100% genuine) are the glue that hold this movie together, as well as being one of the many strong magnetic forces behind a film I just couldn't take my eyes off.The driving force of the film, however, is it's superb script. Funny, witty and as sharp as a razor blade. Every single word and phrase is strategically placed for maximum effect, whether that be with its habitual dry and sardonic mutterings throughout or the moments in which it harks back to archetypes and or conventions of crime capers from yesteryear. The script and its dialogue provide nothing particularly groundbreaking, but it does an exceptional job of developing characters, tear away any feeling of apathy one may initially have toward the primary protagonists, creating the plot's undercurrents and providing the dark comedic aspect that the movie is built upon.I could delve deeper into my analysis of the flick and hark on relentlessly about cinematography, editing, music, specific performances and so forth, but time is currently at a premium and life, I'm told, is very short. So, if you really care to find out, be sure to pick up a copy of this now. You will not be disappointed.",9,3,7,4 March 2007
Rocky," The Film that set the ball rolling (in more ways than one).
","A movie criminally overlooked for the great piece of art it is because of the hideousness of it's sequels and the whole embarrassing sub-genre this, the original underdog story, duly spawned. Back in 1976 and even today Rocky was and should continue to be looked upon as not only groundbreaking, but also as a truly landmark moment in western cinema. I don't merely hyperbole either, because Rocky was the first of it's kind; it was the movie that created an archetype. The underdog story, in which a million-to-one shot gets his one chance at stardom and overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to top the world, is now, an all too familiar tale, but back in 1976 this type of tale, one that captured the very essence of the American dream had never before been brought to the big screen. It was the first of what was now to become a genre of it's own; it was innovation at it's finest.Along with proceeding a long line of copycat stories it was a sports film that wasn't necessarily cantered around the sport; true, the fight was the showpiece of the film but the interpersonal interaction between Rocky and the film's other primary protagonists (Mick, Adrian, Paulie, Apollo, and that gangster guy who's name escapes me currently), provided the ammunition and the motivation behind the Rocky character. The film wasn't only about the sport of boxing it was a step into the human psyche and an analysis on just what the human is capable of under any given circumstance. Rocky was symbolic and a metaphor for the American dream. It was hard hitting (pardon the pun) and frank about putting forth the values and ideology that shaped and continue to, even in an era of immediate gratification, shape American, and to a lesser but no less resonant degree, western society.In this regard the film was also a pretty apt form of social commentary. Using the city of Philadelphia as a backdrop for the times and something of a secondary character for which to juxtapose with the character of Rocky. After Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, mid 1970's America ushered in a new era in American history; a time of hope, a time of freedom and a time when the American dream was as strong as ever, and Rocky, as well as the city of Philadelphia helped represent this wonderfully.A flawless film that captivated a generation and saw life imitate art, in that it shot Sylvester Stallone from wandering nobody to worldwide, overnight super stardom. The perfect Cinderella story and quite possibly the perfect film.",9,0,0,20 June 2007
Scream," Parody at its apex.
","A movie that so many people, including a reviewer on this very website, fail to properly comprehend or get, and one that I'm sure will be looked upon far more affectionately as the years pass. From beginning to end it's one huge tongue in cheek exploration into the conventions that follow and define the slasher movie genre. Never does it take itself as seriously as many of it's viewers do, and never does it lull you into taking it seriously as a plethora of overt clues (the big star death in the opening scene; the movie geek who predicts everything that happens before it actually does; the fumbling underdog who becomes an unlikely hero; the ridiculously overdrawn murder sequences etc) crop up throughout the film time and again just in case those pretentious little twits among us ever get the urge to place this alongside Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho,' or something as equally outrageous. The habitual camera winks the script and the performers give and encourage (Particularly the brilliant Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy) are what sets this apart from many other feeble attempts within the genre and this arrogant form of film-making is probably what made many viewers misconstrue just what the film aims to do.Yes, this movie could be considered horror ('slasher' is the ridiculous term more commonly abused), but to pigeonhole as such is to do one of the 90's greatest parodies/black comedies an immense disservice. If I could hyperbole for a second: not since Shakespeare have comedy and tragedy met in such a dynamic concoction; and rarely has a film captured the imagination of the its viewers so firmly that it's actual premise and concept have been completely ignored and misinterpreted to a point where it has been taken far more seriously than the writers, the director and or the script ever intended it to. That's the beauty of this most wonderful film. So clever it hurts. In fact, it was so good, it still, to this day, continues to be taken seriously. Magnificence personified.",9,0,1,20 June 2007
Am√©lie," Sweet perfection.
","Possibly the most beautiful film in cinematic history; hats off to whomever the cinematographer was because Paris, despite all its beauty has never looked so magical.From beginning to end I was mesmerised by just how rich each and every colour was, how strategically placed every filter was and how apt each scene was in putting forth the colours that reflected the feelings being conveyed. Paris became more than just a backdrop, Paris became yet another protagonist for us to fall in love with, yet another protagonist who's narrative became beyond engaging and impossible to resist and yet another protagonist who's arc mattered. It truly is a showcase in all that is great (of what little there is) about the French; overtly indulgent, pompous to an almost unbearable degree but underneath all the bravado ridiculously charming at its inner most core. A stunning achievement in visual mastery.Juxtaposed with this is the insanely charming lead Audrey Tatu. So lost is she on finding fulfilment for others that she seemingly forgets about finding it for herself. The beauty of the performance and the writing is that whilst she never openly craves it we, now living vicariously through this most lovable of characters, route for her to become emblazoned with the amorous feelings she so craves for those around her. The perfect example of how the primary protagonist of any feel-good film should be wrote and performed. Amelie could well claim to created an archetype; the character that is actually impossible to dislike, but is still as multi-faceted as any character in cinema.An infinitely charming and infectious piece that manages to warm the very cockles of this most cold of hearts.",9,2,7,20 June 2007
300," Just not very good...
","Dreadful. Utterly dreadful. That's about as much as I can muster in regard to this absolute mess.Now, I think I should first let it be known that I'm not a fan of historical epics at the best of times (Spartacus, Lawrence of Arabia and Gladiator being the exceptions to that rule) but I am always willing to give the genre the opportunity to win me over, as the storytelling value, historical relevance and powerhouse performances are often enough to keep hold of even the biggest detractor's (i.e. me) attention. However, from beginning to end, this really did just take the proverbial Mick. Whilst a marvel in just how a movie can now be made (albeit at the complete detriment of every other cinematic fundamental), I found it insipid, slow moving but not particularly detailed, poorly acted (shouting and snarling whilst already shouting and snarling your way through the script should never pass for the kind of emotive acting the genre demands), and beyond ridiculous. There is far too much focus on premise, visuals (completely detached me from feeling anything for anybody in the film - the best films tend to make the surroundings an extra character to juxtapose with the foreground, 300 doesn't even bother trying) and plot and therefore there wasn't a single character I could care less about by the end of the film, as each of the primary protagonists were given nothing like the development or emotional layers that invoke the viewers empathy or sympathy. Each of the main protagonists in most of the films I choose to advocate have a narrative that are equal measures of intriguing, thought evoking and emotionally viable, something 300 would have done well to at least try an attempt.Style over substance and nothing more than a glorified, hammed-up action flick, in similar vein to something as historically and cinematically apt as Conan the destroyer. It really is a shame that they chose to take this particular route and soil a flick and a story with so much potential.Pathetic film.",3,19,60,25 March 2007
Her," A superbly poignant and honest exploration of love, of life, of desire and of science.
","Spike Jonze and Joaquin Phoenix team up to give the Hollywood one of its most honest and clich√©-free stories of love in years. That they've both been able to do this in the overriding guise of a tale based within the realms of the science fiction genre, is testament to the nuance, intrigue and engaging delight they both bring to their central roles.The beauty of the film is its ability to deeply engage and connect on an intimate level with its viewers, despite the concept being inherently cold, distant and drenched amid the deeply insular. It is, therefore, to the credit of the content, the voice acting of Johansson, Jonze's always effervescent and irreverent direction and the central performance of Phoenix that we, the viewers, get so deeply entwined in, what essentially, is the starry eyed equivalent to an anecdote documenting months in the life of a basement-dwelling catfish disciple. As a love story, it provides the kind of perspective Hollywood had seemingly long since lost; almost completely devoid of cinematic clich√© and full of natural verve and a very real look at the connection made on a level beyond the physicality of body and the physicality of carefully constructed monologues. The falling of Phoenix for Johansson is subtle, but feels so entirely natural that by the midpoint of the film - even without being the lonely soul Phoenix is - you can absolutely believe and totally accept why, not only this guy, but you yourself, have fallen for all that Johansson portrays as an outlet of desire. The overriding message that love cannot be defined lineally, that two people who connect initially can grow apart due to different rates of evolution among the pairing and that love is a constantly evolving concept that operates beyond the reams of stagnation is a theme that resonates immensely due to just how superbly well it's driven home and represented within the boundaries the film sets - of which there aren't many, much like the concept of love itself. Love has no definition other than the definition we create for ourselves on an individual level and to expect everyone to fall in-line with that definition - even those we make our partners - is to expect the impossible. The film brilliantly tackles this throughout. As a science fiction piece, it garners itself an even greater standing, exploring themes of the physical and the metaphysical spheres, way beyond what's generally comprehensible within the scope of humanity. That the film manages this through subtext, without compromising the driving, surface level pretext of love, is a victory the likes of which may only really be properly appreciated in the years to come. Just a beautifully pitched film, that delights, despairs and challenges in equal measures and a film that should be watched by anyone who considers themselves a fan of cinema, a scholar of film and a supporter of the exploration of far reaching ideas and screenplay writing that dares to dare.Yet another great addition to Jonze's small, but thus far brilliant, feature length catalogue and one of the most satisfying cinematic experience I've had in years. Loved it.",9,5,10,30 January 2014
