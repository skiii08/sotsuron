Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," STOP PRESSES!!! THIS JUST IN!!
","The Skywalker family and clan is suing Mary Sue Rey, Her bf Jj and Kathleen the destroyer. According to court documents we have reviewed the Skywalker family's case hinges on two facts:1- The Disney and Bad Robot sith temples have derided and destroyed the Skywalker name to such an extent that the name is worth less than zero now.2- The mental anguish inflicted on the family by the no-talent hacks has given rise to suicide and mental anguish and depression and anger and sadness and angst and more to the family and former Star Wars fans.Experts we have interviewed are unanimous. The siths and their minions are guaranteed to lose the libel case.",1,128,173,12 April 2020

","A movie full of sovereign love
I get this film! It is an honor to watch it. I watched this movie after 26 years after its release. I have watched many romance and action-packed movies like Atomic Blonde and maybe that's why I find so few new or refreshing movies nowadays. It is all Mary Sue Marvel crap. Leon is a rare great film.
For me the movie was a fantastic trip. There were scenes where you are treated to a girl trying to seduce or force an adult man to love her. She tells him that she loves him. In one scene she insisted he kiss her. In another scene she forced him to have sex with her and in act of love she forced him to share a bed with her (not sex sadly).
The movie was very inspirational for me and there were many lofty scenes in the movie.
Personally I loved like the movie.",10,4,5,12 April 2020
