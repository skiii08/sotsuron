The Lobster," An allegorical movie with great performances
","It is not everyone's cup of tea, but if you are into weird allegorical movies or you just enjoy a clever movie with good acting, you will like it.The movie outlines the society we live in. How everything is either black or white. How everything is held into place by rules. And if someone does not follow the rules, he/she becomes an outcast. But even the outcasts live by their very own specific instructions. Therefore one cannot avoid rules either way.Within this outline the movie satirizes the soulmate clich√©, how one can only fall in love with a certain person and that person only. And how these two people need to have as many things in common as possible, if they don't, they are definitely not meant for each other.Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz give great performances that save the movie from being flat.",9,1,3,4 September 2016
Whiplash," Thrilling
","I think it is the best music feature film that I've seen so far. It had me on the edge of my seat more than once although it is not an action movie.The cast does not consist of the most famous Hollywood stars, but Teller and Simmons play their roles remarkably.Maybe some may see the mentoring in this movie as too violent. I think that, especially when your family does not support you in pursuing your dream, your only chance is to have an objective person who believes in your strengths and who will push you out of your comfort zone.The theme of pushing yourself and pushing someone else to the limit and beyond perfection is timeless, therefore I hope that this movie will not be soon forgotten.I can't even begin to talk about the music. It seemed that people were skeptical because it is about Jazz, but even a person who hates Jazz will like it. The music does not overwhelm the movie, it goes smoothly together with the plot.I enjoyed it and would watch it again in a heartbeat.",10,0,2,7 February 2015
