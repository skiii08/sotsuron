The Ring," Puts the horror in horrible
","Ever since I saw Ringu I was hooked on everything connected to it.  So I needed to see the American remake.  A lot of people told me it was a scary and very good movie.  The reviews talked about a must see movie. How wrong they all were. I was slapping myself all true the movie and as the story progressed got more and more annoyed with the whole thing.  Then I saw the ace actor Brian Cox and thought that maybe he could raise the level of the movie a bit. But he saw that there was no saving this movie and he quickly killed off his character in a very very strange way.  This was just one of the things that does not make any sense. This remake loses the steady pace Ringu and adds all kinds of things I still don't know what these added to the story.  What was that with the horses? Why does the kid think he sees dead people (pun intended)? Horrible movie, watch Ringu and Ringu 2 (a few scenes of which also end up in this remake adding more confusion) instead.",1,3,9,18 April 2003
