The Avengers," Simply the best super hero movie of all time
",I had the highest of expectations for this film and it over delivered. I would advise you watch in Imax 3d. It was just incredible - the effects - the story line - the humour... the whole cinema was crying with laughter at some parts. The Hulk is scripted better than ever - finally he has been done properly. Banner delivers in every way as normal and he does have a soft spot! I watched this last night and am going to go watch it again today. As an add on for anyone who cant be bothered to travel to see a film like this in IMAX - you really need to make the effort - you wont visit a normal cinema again! Make sure you stay past the final credits - don't miss that. Superb!,10,3,10,28 April 2012
