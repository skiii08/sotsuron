Blade Runner 2049," Disappointing. For fans of director Denis Villeneuve
","Like director Denis Villeneuve's other recent films, this is a simple and empty movie. It's pretentious and disguised as something clever and artistic. It's extremely slow and although I went to see it in the earliest show (in the morning) on the premiere day, I still had to keep myself from falling asleep. The audience was silent but when the end credits rolled I could hear the disappointment of others too.It's extremely long (163 min) and painfully slow and nothing much happens in it. Every scene and every shot is stretched endlessly, like watching an entire movie in slow motion. Ryan Gosling, a very talented actor, unfortunately once again plays the same character which seems to have sticked to him since DRIVER - extremely slow moving, minimum dialog, lots of staring (yeah, Red Letter Media were right in their satire of the trailer). There are bits of interesting scenes sprinkled throughout the movie but they just seem random and don't create any coherent story. It's like scenes and shots made to be put in a trailer.On the good side, there is a good production, good sets, impressive cinematography by veteran Roger Deakins, and they really tried to replicate (no pun intended) the world create in the original movie. If you watch closely, you'll even notice an ad for Pan Am, just like in the original movie. The music is also similar to Vangelis' style at times (including 'Tears in Rain' at the end). I should mention that this is the second time this year that Hans Zimmer uses the Shepard tone and as much as I like Zimmer, the use of the Shepard tone here was too obvious.I was also very impressed by Carla Juri's scene as Dr. Ana Stelline and I liked the Joi/Mariette scene.All in all, this is a very disappointing movie with some good visuals. I kept my expectations low and I was still disappointed.4-4.5/10 Disappointing. For fans of director Denis Villeneuve.",4,20,48,5 October 2017
Black Swan," Black Swan
","Just watched it. I have some mixed feelings, but overall I'm quite impressed.Natalie Portman: I believe this is the first movie I saw Natalie Portman actually acting. Of course I enjoyed seeing her in previous films, mainly because she's so damn cute/hot, but I was never really impressed by her acting. This movie is a new level for her. I'm not surprised to see her nominated for a Golden Globe.Barbara Hershey: The Mother was really tailored for Ellen Burstyn. I actually imagined Burstyn playing this part while watching some of the scenes. Darren could have changed the mother into a grandmother and put Burstyn there - she would have been perfect. That's not saying that Hershey wasn't good - she was.Mila Kunis: I'm not familiar with her work, so it's hard for me to judge. I can't say I was impressed by her acting. I think it was average, nothing more.Vincent Cassel: He gives an excellent performance.Cinematography: I love Matthew Libatique's work. He's a genius. In this movie I have some mixed feelings. The dancing parts were really special. It felt like the camera is dancing with the dancers - and I believe that's what Libatique was aiming for. As for shooting the entire movie with a hand-held camera - well, I'm not too crazy about this concept in general and this movie is no exception. I think it's distracting. I prefer clean cinematography. Having said that, the hand-held shooting makes more sense on the second part of the movie. Oh, and BTW, the extended use of hand-held camera and especially the shooting behind the back reminded me of 'The Wrestler'. I read that some people suggest that the two movies are two halves of the same film. I partially agree on that, as I also noticed the similarities between the two movies while watching Black Swan.Music: Clint Mansell does it again. I don't think I've ever actually heard the entire Swan Lake, so I really can't tell how much of the score is original. In any case, it works. The music on the second part of the film (and especially towards the end) is bombastic - and it works!Effects: I really liked the body modifications. Too bad there wasn't more of it. The body change in front of the mirror immediately felt like the work of David Cronenberg.I really expected to see a long and extended full body modification - and I got some of it at the end of the movie during the dance. They did quite an amazing work there with the visual effects while she dances. Again, too bad it wasn't longer.Direction: Darren Aronofsky's direction is solid as always. The first part is a bit slow, but never boring. And yes, it's not easy to make Ballet look cool. The second part (or last third) is where the movie's momentum really is. Again, I really liked the body modifications and I really wish they were more elaborated and that there were more of them.Mirrors: While watching the movie it was obvious to me that Darren aimed to have a mirror in every scene. Nice concept, but a was a bit distracting at times - especially during the dancing, when my attention was more about watching Darren's use of doubles in order to achieve the camera not reflecting in the mirror (an old trick that is always impressive on film).I'm not sure I got all the meanings Darren wanted to give - and I guess that's partially the reason I didn't completely identified with the movie. I guess I'll have to rewatch it.Overall, a very good film. Much better than the other Drek we see lately (=in recent years). No, I don't think it deserves to be in IMDb's top 250 and I don't think it's Darren's best, but I liked it more than 'The Wrestler' and overall it's a very good film.6.5/10 That's my first impression. I should watch it again.",7,1,5,20 December 2010
Requiem for a Dream," An experience
","'Requiem for a Dream (2000)' is, in my opinion, the best movie made in the last several years. Someone said that you don't watch the movie - you experience it. I totally agree. It's a difficult movie to take. It deals with drugs and puts it in your face without any mercy (somebody described it as being smacked on the head for 100 minutes). It follows the stories of 4 different people, each escaping reality and getting deteriorated by his own addictions: To drugs, to pills, to alcohol, to TV, to his dreams of a better life. I haven't seen in years such an amazing and effective combination of acting, photography, editing, lighting, music, writing, makeup and costume design. This movie is 'perfect' in each of these fields. The entire cast is fantastic, but Ellen Burstyn is extraordinary, giving the performance of her life. It's unbelievable that Julia Roberts got the Oscar instead, that year. This movie, made for $4.5m, is only Darren Aronofsky's second  feature (after the fantastic Pi). He handles it like its his 20th on a budget of $45m. It didn't take him long to become one of my favorite directors, and I can't wait for his next movie.  Don't forget to check out the fantastic official site for a taste of the movie. Also, try to get the trailer, which is one of the best I've seen, and the great soundtrack by Clint Mansell (of 'Pop will Eat itself').",10,0,1,16 May 2002
Captain Phillips," Average
","Paul Greengrass, who did a great job with 'United 93 (2006)', once again gives us a movie based on real events. This time it's about Somali pirates and a cargo ship.Good production, but there's nothing really new or exceptionally interesting about the movie. It's just OK - and like most movies nowadays, it's over 2 hours and a bit too long.Good score by Henry Jackman is the main reason for keeping the movie intense and interesting for so long.Too much shaky cam (annoying especially in the beginning of the movie).The cast is good. Tom Hanks gives an excellent performance during the last 5 min of the movie - which is worth the entire movie, I guess - but it doesn't justify a Golden Globes nomination.",5,2,4,10 October 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," Would have worked a lot better as a short
","Just what you expected: It has nothing to do with CLOVERFIELD (and marketing it as if it's a sort of sequel is hurting the enjoyment of watching this movie as a standalone); John Goodman is good in his role; It's way too long and the plot doesn't hold the length of a full feature.The movie has a lot in common with the theme of THE THING (and incidentally - or not - the actress played in the remake): Claustrophobic atmosphere, people locked together, paranoia, changing between trusting and mistrusting over and over.At the end, some of the stuff you see during the movie don't really make sense.",4,1,2,23 July 2016
The Finest Hours," Terrible
","The only reason to watch this film is to appreciate James Cameron's amazing talent in THE ABYSS. All the energy and credibility that Cameron created in THE ABYSS is lacking here. The boat looks like a studio set, the acting is drained of any energy and credibility and all the CGI makes it very hard to suspend your disbelief. Everything that made The Abyss a masterpiece is missing here.Casey Affleck is absolutely terrible. Just try to think of his performance next to Ed Harris' - it's impossible to compare them.And the clichés, oh, the clichés. The movie opens with 15 minutes of establishing that the protagonist got the case of the not-gays and it's more and more clichés from there.Oh, and how the hell did LARRY KUBIAC become an old man Brian Dennehy all of the sudden?",3,2,5,27 November 2016
The Expendables 2," Put your brains in neutral and enjoy the silly action and explosions
","It has all the old clichés you can think of, so there's no point for me to list them. Silly action with zero surprises and silly script. But you know what? If you want to spend 1.5 hours with nonsense-action, it's okay. Lots of explosions, lots of splatter and people heads exploding/decapitating, etc. - and of course the bad guys always keep missing the good guys when shooting them.The movie is a big reunion of the 80's action actors - even bigger than that of the first movie - with some of them (Schwarzenegger, Norris, Willis) making no more than a guest appearance (but not short enough to be called a cameo).Schwarzenegger was the worst IMO - not only did he look old, but his acting (yeah, yeah, it's all relative) was more like a governor trying to act in a movie, not an experienced actor making a comeback; his acting seemed forced and all his lines were one-liners, half of them with some obvious reference to the old action movies. ('I'll be back', Rambo, Die Hard). It was overused and uber-obvious.",5,0,0,10 October 2015
Skyfall," Okay
","The first third of the movie felt like one of the best Bonds I've seen in years, mainly thanks to a wonderful crew (great cinematography by Roger Deakins, great score by Thomas Newman, solid direction and good stunt work). Good acting by the cast.The rest of the movie felt waaaaay too long. The last third, especially, didn't feel like a Bond movie at all (like RedLetterMedia put it, it felt more like 'Home Alone'). There is no traditional main villain with a grand plan to take over the world.I like Bardam, he's a good actor and although he did his best with the material he was given, and - like other said - his character felt a bit like the Joker, he wasn't intimidating like other Bond villains.There are some nods to old Bond movies here and there.Ben Whishaw is a good actor and I tend to like him as the new Q. Ralph Fiennes' talent is wasted. As for Judi Dench, I never really liked her as M but why did they replace her?All in all, it's a okay movie. Too long and non-typical Bond, but worth watching, especially for the first third of the movie.",5,2,7,10 October 2015
Wind River," So-so
","Written and directed by Taylor Sheridan. This is the guy who wrote HELL OR HIGH WATER and SICARIO, so you know what to expect. It's a very slow movie, taking place in a snowy Native American reservation. A young FBI female agent is sent to investigate a death.It's not that bad... but it's not that great either. It's slow in a good way, but also slow in a bad way. It has a good snowy isolation atmosphere, some good emotional situations. But still, it was too slow and too little happens. It's only 107 min long but it felt like a 2.5 hours movie.With Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen who looks like a young Michelle Pfeiffer.",5,32,74,13 August 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Total borefest - I almost fell asleep
","(Minor spoilers are indicated)It's pretty bad, but I guess STAR WARS fans would enjoy it. It's more of the same. Lots of shooting, lots of bombing, lots of starship fights. All pointless. I was waiting for the movie to be over. You know how Peter Jackson loves to release extended versions in which he shoves more and more unnecessary stuff just to fill up the time? It feels the same. This is a 90-min movie (at best) 'squeezed' into 134 min. You saw EPISODE 3 and you saw EPISODE 4, so you already know what happened before and after - you can't spoil the plot and this movie just serves as an unnecessary filler that adds nothing.And if you're waiting to see Darth Vader, you're in for a huge letdown. His appearance in this movie is less than 5 min and it's easily the worst Darth Vader costume I've seen. Actually, all the costumes looked pretty amateurish. The CGI was pretty good and some good one-liners here and there. That's it. A pointless movie just to grab more money and fill the gap between the main STAR WARS movies.* MINOR SPOILERS - START *What I liked about the plot is how the writers managed to find a good explanation (excuse) for the biggest plothole in STAR WARS (i.e.: Why would the Empire build a Death Star with a backdoor to blow it up) and the ending which, although expected, was nice for tying it with the beginning of STAR WARS 4. I also liked that they DIDN'T try to turn this into a feminist propaganda - the female lead was just there and they didn't make a big deal out of it. K-2SO was a nice sidekick.* MINOR SPOILERS - END *The audience pleasantly surprised me. It's the first time I attend a movie on its first day of screening and I expected lots of noisy kids. Nothing like that. Total silence, except for some nice cheering at the beginning, at the middle and at the end.",3,91,187,15 December 2016
The Hunger Games," Enjoyable
","(This review was originally posted on April 2012)After all my ranting from seeing the trailer, I hate to admit it but it was actually a very enjoyable movie. Yes, the script is a like mix of '1984' (the conversation scene of the couple talking by the window was pretty much a rip-off of the exact same conversation by the window in '1984'), 'Battle Royale', 'The Running Man', 'Lord of the Flies' and 'The Truman Show', but it's very well made. With a running time of almost 2.5 hours, it was good enough not to notice it's that long.The shaky camera at the beginning is absolutely dreadful, but they don't keep long.Good action, good production, good effects, good score, good acting and solid direction. I'll be looking forward to the sequel.",6,0,2,22 January 2014
Argo," Argo (2012)
","Solid direction. The movie starts very strong and basically continues well, however the actions and the entire cover-up story seem unnecessary - just until the final part, where every piece falls to its place in a manner that is way too unbelievable. It's like a James Bond movie, where Q gives Bond a gadget - and you know a specific situation would come when Bond will need just that exact thing. The entire last part is just too unrealistic in cinema terms. I haven't read the details of the true events, but I highly doubt ANYTHING was SUCH a close call. I especially hated the 'Apollo 13'-like ending.Tension is kept throughout the movie, but the problem is that you already know there's going to be a happy ending (even if you knew nothing about the real events, like myself), so it loses a much greater potential it could have had otherwise.Still, Affleck once again proves himself as a very competent director and the production design is excellent - from a non-professional eyes it looked completely believable as Iran, both in terms of locations and people. I think it deserved a nomination for production design. Alan Arkin was good as always, John Goodman was nice but didn't have a lot of material to work with and the rest of the cast were 'ok' in their parts.All in all, it's a good movie. Like 'The Impossible (2012)', it's not a masterpiece, but in a pathetic year at the cinema, it stands out as one of the better films of 2012.5.5/10 Worth watching",5,4,7,13 January 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Watch it for Gosling, Stone and Tomei
","First of all - amazing cast. I knew nothing about this movie, so I was surprised by more great actors popping out every time: Ryan Gosling, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, Emma Stone (who easily becomes a favorite of mine), John Carroll Lynch and Julianne Moore. I have nothing against Steve Carell, but he's really the weakest link here. Then again, I have nothing for him, he's just... Steve Carell, the same character in every movie.Gosling, Stone and Tomei (whose screen time is criminally short) are really the highlight of the movie. The three of them are fantastic. Gosling, a favorite of mine, proves time after time that he's a wonderful actor and continues to give excellent performance in every movie.The movie itself is really uneven. There are some wonderful scenes and dialogs, but other scenes are not that great and the plot... hm... I can't put my hands on it, but it's not constructed well enough.Still, some good laughs and the cast is excellent.5/10 Recommended",5,1,2,14 October 2011
The Danish Girl," Disappointing
","Pro: Eddie Redmayne's performance, nice low-key score by Alexandre Desplat (one theme reminded me of Howard Shore's score to DEAD RINGERS), nice production design of 1920's Europe.Con: Story is a bit weak. I also found it a bit confusing.The trivia on IMDb (and the info on Wikipedia) explains a lot about my confusion with the story. Both the movie and the book its based on are changed a lot of major details of the true story, basically making it into fiction. The details of the true story made a lot more sense.All in all, I'm disappointed. I had very high expectations for this movie.Alicia Vikander isn't impressive at all in her role. She was excellent in EX-MACHINA and should have won the Oscar for that role instead.I should mention that her hair color is EXTREMELY distracting. Her eyebrows have a totally different color and this simply doesn't go with the era. I never notice these things, but here it was simply too obvious and distracting.",5,0,2,23 July 2016

Creed," For Rocky fans only
","1.5 min in and I'm already distracted by the direction (1 min are the production logos, BTW)Alarm is sound, kids go the wall, sit on the ground and raise their hand - only to hear the officer say: 'on the ground, show your hands'. It's so obvious that this take was done so many times, that the kids already know what to do so they do it automatically. The guy playing the officer just says his lines, without even noticing that it's not relevant anymore. After that, the officer just stands without doing anything - because he didn't receive any other lines or instructions from the director.Continuing the shot, the camera goes to the next room. It's supposed to be a fight in progress (that's why the alarm was sound), but the actors are just waiting for the camera guy to enter the room and only then start the fight.My god, what a sloppy direction. And it's only the FIRST shot of the movie!This movie just goes on and on. It's way too long, too predictable, too 'by the book'. You really need to be a Rocky fan to enjoy watching the same movie you've seen so many times before. You'll forget this movie 10 minutes after watching it.Stallone and the lead actor are OK in their role.",5,3,6,23 July 2016
Terminator Salvation," Recommended
","I believe it's the third time I'm watching this movie. I'm not familiar with McG's other work, but this one is very impressive - good solid direction (with some original ideas, like the one long take in and out of the helicopter), fantastic almost-flawless CGI and animatronics, excellent sound editing, cinematography, stunts, makeup and score by Elfman. Pretty decent script with some original ideas.The movie is not without flaws - and it's not 'Terminator 1' or 'Terminator 2' - but it's pretty good on its own.Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of actor/director Ron Howard) is beautiful but simply a terrible actress.I don't understand how the awful 'Terminator 3' is considered better than this one and can't believe that after this wonderful sequel they still haven't greenlighted part 5.",6,2,6,10 October 2015
Concussion," Skip it
",So slow. This movie hardly moves. It takes half the run-time just to get to the point you already know from the title of the movie.Actors are OK in their roles. I think it's the first time I actually see Will Smith playing - or at least his foreign accent is pretty good for the character - although it's not entirely consistent - but there isn't much more than that and nothing interesting about the character itself. Is it worth an Oscar nomination? The movie is obviously made like an 'Oscar material': It's an 'important issue' with an 'important character'. But the movie is extremely weak. Pacing is terrible and you get the point in 5 minutes. It goes on and on and I finally gave up around the midpoint. I'm not impressed.,4,7,11,23 July 2016
Don Jon," Watch it
","Starts very well, very impressive for first-time feature writer/director Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Then in the middle it loses a lot of its potential (especially when Scarlett Johansson's character is revealed to be a total bitch, which makes absolutely no sense in Joseph's character wanting to keep her and acting like her dog, apologizing endlessly - even after they already split; It's like he totally lost his balls; I couldn't stand watching her character! Also, he ends up with a woman 20 years older than him, ahm... isn't that a LITTLE weird?). I wanted to like the film, but found myself doing some stuff while watching it.Also, I didn't understand whether Johansson's character was supposed to be Italian with this accent (first I thought she was supposed to be Jewish, but then you see her with a cross in one scene). It's funny that both lead actors, who are Jewish, are playing these very-Christian roles.I liked Tony Danza. Haven't seen him acting in years and he was hilarious in most of the scenes (the best one was when he meets his son's girlfriend for the first time - actually made me LOL). The whole interaction between him and his son (and their accent) is great.",5,1,3,10 October 2015
The Terminator," Still remains one of the best movies ever made
","I know it by heart, but haven't seen it in ages.Brilliant. Just brilliant film. James Cameron is a genius - was and still is one of the best filmmakers of our time. While some of the effects dated a bit (the terminator face surgery always seemed fake to me, even when watching it as a kid, but I still liked it then and like it now) and are more obvious when watching the movie in HD instead of a VHS (most notably the rear projection effects), this movie remains an achievement for its time and budget and still holds to this day the same effect it had 30 years ago.Fantastic combination of vision, effects, writing, direction, cinematography, score and production. Good acting by the entire cast.I'm curious as for why Cameron chose to reveal the 'terminator view' when he did and didn't save it up for a bit later. It's hard for me to judge, having watched this movie so many times, but wouldn't it have been better not to show it at that scene and let the audience wonder whether Kyle is really telling the truth or just making up stuff?",10,0,1,9 October 2015
Ready Player One," Recommended
","Let's start with the bottom line: This is the most enjoyable Spielberg movie in the past 15 years. Notice I wrote 'enjoyable' and not 'best'. It's still a kids movie - the plot is simple (it's about literally looking for a MacGuffin - an Easter egg), stuff is spelled out, spoon fed to the audience and repeated twice (even the secret of the 3rd challenge is revealed twice!), so don't expect anything smart. However, it's visually stunning and I regret watching it in 2D because it seems to be the only movie since 'Avatar' to be worth watching in 3D. Sound is also impressive.There are tons of pop culture references and for us 80's kids, this is a delight. I bet the kids watching this will miss many of those references but for us they are obvious and straight in the face. And there's one big gem in the middle of the movie which I won't spoil, so I'll just say that Kubrick fans will have a blast - I don't know if it's part of the original book but i'm quite certain it was a treat for Spielberg to handle.With references to movies, songs and games appearing almost every two minutes, I have no idea how they could have afford it - I know it's a blockbuster movie but still, the royalties were probably huge (unless the studio owns the rights).The music was an obvious Alan Silvestri work. I thought perhaps it was John Williams trying to imitate Silvestri because it's a Spielberg movie and there were so many 80's references, but checking the credits, it's really him.Mark Rylance was brilliant as Halliday and I honestly didn't recognize him until checking the IMDB credits now. I also didn't recognize Simon Pegg.Aech's voice was terribly miscast (but there's a reason for that, revealed later).All in all, it's a fun movie. If you're an 80's kid and if you liked 'Avatar' and/or 'Wreck it Ralph', you'll enjoy this film.",6,2,7,28 March 2018
The Hateful Eight," For Tarantino fans only
","I should probably mention that I'm not a Tarantino fan and haven't even seen his last two movies.Kurt Russel in a snow blizzard, stuck in a small place with people he doesn't trust and with the score of Ennio Morricone. Sounds familiar? If not, go watch THE THING.Look, this movie is not a western and I think it was a mistake to market it as such. It's a theater play of people just sitting and talking. I have nothing against that, but this movie is too slow, too long (almost 3 hours) and nothing much happens in it.It was interesting for the first 45 but then it just goes on and on.I was also disappointed by Jennifer Jason Leigh's role. I expected something with a lot more 'teeth' and she deserves much better and challenging roles.",4,2,7,23 July 2016
Fast & Furious 6," Skip it or fast forward to the good parts
","Technically the movie is pretty good - some good chase scenes, good cinematography (although distracting at times and repeating itself too many times - especially the nice shot opposite the traffic that suddenly gets higher), but the movie itself is terribly boring, and you get 130 min(!!!) of that. The movie would have been much better if it would have been shorten to 90 min and cut all the nonsense. We all know it's a blockbuster chase movie without a plot, so why trying to pretend otherwise?And Gal Gadot is pretty bad. She keeps that annoying smile even when shooting. Someone should teach her basic acting - she's bad even when NOT speaking.Skip it or fast forward to the good parts - A few good chase scenes don't cover for such a boring movie.",Null,1,5,10 October 2015
Suicide Squad," Awful
","My god, that was AWFUL. Just random made-for-trailer tiny scenes that add to nothing, have zero depth and don't make up a coherent plot. Wall-to-wall inappropriate songs that come at random times. Boring plot (if you can even call it that), boring and indistinguishable flat characters. Harley Quinn was annoying. Jared Leto did his best as The Joker but had absolutely nothing to work with - he just appears at random times for a few seconds and disappears. There's no depth and no story. If you've seen the trailers, you basically saw all the one-liners and 'money shots'.If all that isn't enough, the last third of the movie is simply unwatchable.I don't think David Ayer is a bad director (I liked HARSH TIMES and FURY), but this is definitely his worst movie yet and I'm pretty sure it's due to massive pressure from the producers.",1,587,774,10 August 2016
Interstellar," Disappointing
","Just saw it at the cinema. Let's start at the bottom line: I'm disappointed. #12 on IMDb with 217k votes and 9.0/10 rating and comparing it to movies such as 2001 is more than overrated - it's almost a joke.This movie reminded me of Contact (also with Matthew McConaughey), Moon, Sunshine and Gravity, but all of these are in magnitude better than this movie. There is also an influence of 2001 and a wink or two to it (TARS' joke about releasing a person out of the airlock and its features which make it look like the Monolith). But on the whole, this movie isn't deep at all. Like many other Nolan movies (Inception in particular), it has a very simple idea that is extended and stretched in the movie, making it looks complex and/or epic, but it's actually pretty simple. In this movie, in particular, the writing is quite simplistic and isn't very thought-provoking. Like I said before, I think Nolan is a very capable director, but he's extremely overrated (like David Fincher).What disturbed me the most was the lack of emotion that I felt throughout most of the movie. I think I can blame Hans Zimmer for most of it. Zimmer is a fantastic composer and all his scores for Nolan movies are excellent, but in this movie he totally failed IMO. Again, it may be a combination of writing and direction, but mainly the score was lacking. There are quite a few emotional scenes that are almost stolen from Moon - but while Clint Mansell's brilliant score to Moon lift the emotion to extreme heights and can make me cry almost instantly (no matter how many times I watch Moon), Zimmer's score to this movie did almost nothing to me.Matthew McConaughey gives a solid performance, especially during the emotional scenes. Ellen Burstyn is good in her tiny guest role. Jessica Chastain, which I absolutely hated in Zero Dark Thirty, isn't that great in this movie either, except for one short emotional scene which is brilliantly performed by her (I'm referring to her recorded message).While there are a few good visuals in this movie, even this aspect was quite a letdown. Gravity was MUCH more impressive in that respect.Even TARS the robot seems like it's taken from a B-movie. While I came to like some of its abilities (the running scene is my favorite), it doesn't come close to any of the qualities presented by GERTY the robot from Moon.All in all, this is an entertaining film, but really nothing more than that.5.5/10 So-so",6,4,8,18 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars: The Rise of Dr. Channard
","Star Wars: The Rise of Dr. Channard is an empty movie that concludes the trilogy of fan service rehash movies.
Its biggest problem is that it so obviously tries to patch all the problems and mistakes of the previous movie which itself ruined key plots of the first movie. Doing that, it ignores and contradicts previous stuff. For example: Rey's family obviously had significance in the first movie, but turned out to be nothing in the second movie, only to actually be of significance in the third movie. This is a result of a story that is written in patches without any planning at all.
The second problem is poor dialog and characters. Finn might be the worst character in movie history. He should be named 'Mr. Exposition'. He's only there to do exposition and repeat stuff that other characters say or explain what happens on the screen. This is the problem with most of the characters in the movie but Finn is by far the worst. Basically, the dialog is intended for 3-year olds and feeds you everything twice. 'They fly now! They flying now? They fly now...' (a dialog by three characters on a flying speeder, amazed by flying Stormtroopers).
Beside having scenes that have nothing to do with each other, the movie is also full of clichÃ©s, most notably characters thought to be dead who aren't and characters coming back from the dead - most notably Palpatine, who is basically Dr. Channard from Hellraiser II in this movie.
All in all, this is a fan service movie. Fans would love it. Anyone else should treat it like the silly popcorn-chewing blockbuster movie that it is.",4,63,147,19 December 2019
Pacific Rim," Recommended
","For me it was the most enjoyable Guillermo del Toro movie yet. I'm not a big fan of him, but this movie was cool.Don't expect too much - it's a summer blockbuster. Robots vs. Monsters, nothing more. But it's well done, intense, with good CGI and score, good production design (Carol Spier, Cronenberg's regular) and decent acting.I liked the goofy/clichéd/eccentric characters played by Burn Gorman (Gottlieb), Charlie Day (Dr. Geiszler) and Ron Perlman (Hannibal Chau). Actually, I recognized Clifton Collins Jr. as Choi and was certain he also plays the role of Gottlieb - they look absolutely like the same actor!My main criticism is about Del Toro getting into the territory of George Lucas' 'It's so dense' and Michael Bay's extreme close ups of action scenes. There's simply too much movement on the screen all the time: Rain, fog, robots and monsters in extreme close ups. It's too much for the eyes and I'm very pleased not watching the 3D version, which is probably a torture.Also, the movie is slightly too long and should have ended a bit earlier - The ending is simply too much of an action/mess.Overall it's a very enjoyable popcorn movie and I recommend seeing the 2D version.",7,0,1,10 October 2015
Southpaw," Fuqua shouldn't make any more movies
","WARNING: Major spoilers in this reviewAntoine Fuqua shows again what a bad director he is. This movie is a combination of a terrible plot and writing, and bad direction. The only good thing about this movie is Jake Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker.In this movie, you have the champion of the world in boxing, who makes tens of million of dollars and lives in a mansion, manages in a few days to somehow lose his wife, his job, his house, his daughter, to become a drugged/alcohol addict, a suicidal and a potential killer. This is the plot of a goofy comedy, not a boxing drama. It's ridiculous and it makes absolutely no sense. It also takes half the movie time and the situations repeat themselves like a bad soap opera: mistake -> tragedy - > sad music ... and repeat.The characters are brainless and have moronic motives. Just as an example, this guy who is so worried about his daughter, has no problem wanting/trying to commit suicide - and more than once.Rachel McAdams is terrible. From the beginning of the movie I said to myself that we see her WAY too much - and I knew there was a reason for that. Showing her tits and body all the time is the fault of the director. But the bad acting is a combination of bad direction, bad writing and Rachel fault.A minor getting into a family court for custody case? Are you kidding me? Was this movie written by a 10-year old? His wife dies and the first thing he does after the funeral is leave his minor daughter alone? Did the writer live under a stone or something? This is an obvious attempt to show us that the character is suffering, but it's cheap and makes absolutely no sense.Antoine Fuqua is simply a bad director. He can't direct actors and his movies are just bad. Training Day was a decent movie at best, but somehow it made him big in Hollywood.Jake Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker are the only good thing about this movie, but they can't save a movie that was so poorly written and directed.",3,34,61,3 September 2015
Fargo," Highly recommended
","Haven't seen the movie in a long time. I don't consider it a masterpiece like many others, but I think it's a great movie. 'Low-key' is the keyword (no pun intended) in this movie: Score, Peter Stormare's character, John Carroll Lynch's character (Norm) and his relationship with Marge. All make the movie great.Wonderful atmosphere (combination of location, score, cinematography and direction), great cast and direction.John Carroll Lynch's character (Norm) and his relationship with his wife. It's so innocent, loyal, natural and low-key. I also love Peter Stormare's character. Again, low-key with minimum dialog. He's one of the main villains, but looks so innocent - like a kid at times. He's intimidating by NOT talking and just giving a blank look.Frances McDormand is very good in her role, but IMO it's not worthy of an Oscar. Definitely not for 'Lead Role'.",7,0,0,10 October 2015
Rush," Best Ron Howard film in the last 20 years
","Man, that was a good movie! Heard some good reviews and wanted to see it, but I prepared myself to be disappointed.I didn't like any of Ron Howard's films which came after 'Backdraft (1991)', but this movie shows he's still go it.Technical aspect is excellent: Score (didn't realize it was Hans Zimmer until I looked it up just now), editing, cinematography, sound editing and I assume there is a lot of seamless CGI. And makeup.All of the above really give energy to the races and put the viewer inside the race. Great job. I loved the rough cinematography and editing - it gave the movie a documentary-like feel.Daniel Bruhl is excellent in his role and gives one of the better performances I've seen this year. I just noticed that he's nominated for a Golden Globe - he deserves that. Wait, he's nominated in 'supporting role'? wtf?Chris Hemsworth is basically playing himself, but he's a good casting choice and fits the role very well.Don't get me wrong: A #149 place on IMDb is ridiculous and 2013 was a very weak year at the cinema, but this movie gets my vote on the list of the 'Best Movies of 2013'.I'm surprised to see that it did so poorly at the cinema: $90m worldwide on a $38m budget. I was certain it made much more.7/10 Highly recommended",7,2,3,31 December 2013
Nightcrawler," So-so
","Disappointing. The trailer didn't look promising, but I read reviews saying it's the best film of the year. It's not, far from it. It's a very mediocre movie. Jake Gyllenhaal is good in his role, but there is almost no character development, just like there is almost no plot development. Same goes for the rest of the characters, who have almost no arc. The movie just repeats the same events over and over. Even the ending was too predictable (at least for me). This is not a bad movie, but it's really nothing special.Oh, and putting Bill Paxton there is a weird choice. It makes the plot look almost like a remake of 'Twister' - in both movies they are chasing the 'big event' and the protagonist's opponent gets seriously injured in the middle of the film.",5,4,7,9 October 2015
Baby Driver," Rubbish - Don't Believe the Hype
","I watched it at the cinema (premiere day) and couldn't wait for it to be over. It's less than 2 hours long (which is rare nowadays) but it felt like 3 hours.Ridiculous dialog, boring plot. The 'love story' is not just bad - it's pure offensive, I haven't seen such awful dialog since STAR WARS 2, this is something Tommy Wiseau could have written, it's like something made by an alien who doesn't know how human interaction works. And the clichés... oh god.The action scenes were bad. Ultra-fast cuts and close-ups which don't let you see anything and make your eyes travel back and forth between cuts (sitting at the second row didn't help). This is Michael Bay style and I can't stand it. I blame the director and especially the editor - I can't blame Bill Pope since he's a wonderful DP. I can't believe people like this movie so much. Several reviews on IMDb praised it as one of the best action movies and this summer's best blockbuster. Did I see the same movie?I've seen worse films in my life, but this one was just offensive for my IQ. Any person with half a brain cell and a minimum knowledge of film should be offended by this movie.",4,34,68,29 June 2017
Split," Only worth watching for James McAvoy
","I guess the fact that I actually wanted to watch an M. Night Shyamalan movie (haven't done that since THE HAPPENING (2008)) and actually sat through the entire movie (losing interest while watching it) is an achievement by itself. Still, it was everything I expected from a Shyamalan movie and from watching the trailer. James McAvoy is too talented for this silly movie, which had a big potential in terms of plot, but it was reduced to the regular Shyamalan garbage. It starts well, but gets worse and worse until it reaches the awful silly ending.BTW, although Anya Taylor-Joy is a main character, I think she has less lines of dialog than Arnie in the first TERMINATOR.As always, Shyamalan has to give himself a silly cameo. And the last scene... oh, god, the cringe.This film is only worth watching for James McAvoy.",4,51,122,27 January 2017
Warrior," Great performance in an unbalanced movie
","Well, I have mixed feelings about this movie. All 3 lead actors give a great performance. Not Oscar worthy, if you ask me, but Nick Nolte MIGHT be nominated, as this is his best acting in years and kind of reminds me of James Coburn in 'Affliction (1997)' (with Nick Nolte, incidentally) - a performance that I felt was less deserving of an Oscar than his performance in 'American Gun (2002)'. Tom Hardy, who I came to appreciate since seeing 'Bronson (2008)', is great as usual and Joel Edgerton was hard for me to judge, since I'm not really familiar with his work (although as I now check IMDb, he was great in 'Smokin' Aces', just like the rest of the cast there).The movie feels like two movies, quite different in tone, that were mixed into one movie, like a big salad. The first half of the movie elaborates on the background of the dysfunctional family and its inner tensions. The director handles the story very well, with low-key approach (I especially liked Hardy's - how his character was written and how he played the part) and gives the actors a great opportunity to show us a great performance.That is why I was so let down by the second half. The disappointed starts sharply with a cliché montage of training. It's like we've never seen 'Rocky' before. Not only is the story completely predictable, but you get the usual scenes that were done in so many 'fighting movies' before: Insertion of 'pre-recorded' crowd reactions (that completely break the flow of the fight), a wife that covers her mouth at least 6 times and commentators who are always surprised.It's almost hard to believe that the two halves of the movie were directed by the same person. I can say the same about the Tess character/actress: It was written/acted pretty well in the first half, but was completely lowered to 'cliché level' in the second half.The fights by themselves were directed well. It's just too bad they had to contain all the flaws I mentioned above, which ruined the enjoyment a bit (I blame both the director and the editor).All in all, the film is enjoyable. Watch the first half for a good drama and the second half for a cliché fighting story.5/10 Recommended",5,7,20,5 December 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Just as Boring as the Swedish Version
","I didn't like the original movie and I don't like this remake either. Except for the main titles, which were cool, I found the entire movie boring, EXTREMELY long and very badly written (the entire plot is pretty useless and doesn't really lead to the revealed truth - and that's a bad psychology thriller/mystery writing). I had to FORCE myself to watch the movie. At the end, after over 2 hours, I finally cracked and started to fast forward.I came to like Daniel Craig since I (re-)watched his impressive performance in The Jacket. However, I wasn't impressed by any of the cast members in this movie. I don't remember the original movie, so I can't compare Rooney Mara's performance to that of Noomi Rapace. It seemed to me like she's playing a 'simple' depressed Emo girl, nothing more. The violent scene was indeed impressive in its shock value, but I don't think that alone deserves an Oscar nomination.Like Tarsem Singh, I appreciate Fincher's style (although I wasn't impressed with his direction of 'The Social Network' and 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'), but I don't connect to most of his movies. It seems to me like his fans (especially since 'The Social Network') would eat anything he makes, even if it stinks to high heavens. Not to mention that the movie is over 2.5 hours long! Was it really necessary? Yeah, the original movie was also that long, but it doesn't justify the length of either of them.3.5/10 Avoid",4,3,10,26 January 2012
Dunkirk," I had low expectations and it was still disappointing.
","I always said that Nolan knows how to handle films technically and this one is not different. But this is a 100 min battle scene with almost no structure and very little character involvement/development and almost no emotional connection. Some of the scenes are impressive (I really liked the aerial footage) and the sound blasted the cinema. But it's not enough to make a good film. I didn't feel involved and even though the movie is only 100 min (pretty short in today's norm, which has become AT LEAST 2 hours long) it still felt pretty long.I should probably mention that the hand-held camera (especially in the beginning of the film) was way too shaky for my taste and felt very uncomfortable.Nolan has his hits and misses. He's very capable, but I still think he's one of the most overrated directors and whatever he'll do people will praise as the best movie ever made.4/10 Disappointing",4,8,15,30 July 2017
Aliens," A quick comment about the Director's Cut
","I watched the 'Director's Cut' once or twice before. As much as I love the additional scenes in all of James Cameron's 'Special Editions', when I saw it before I thought the added scene with Newt's family diminished from the effect of meeting Newt later. This time I thought it was actually even better: Meeting Newt as a 'regular girl' first and then seeing her transformation, actually adds a layer to her character. I really liked the way she acted and thought it was a great combination of casting, acting and direction. Not that her screamings weren't annoying at times, but all in all, I think she was excellent in her role and more believable than many other kids I saw in movies.James Horner's score is excellent.BTW, did you notice that when they discuss Bishop, they mention that the android from the first movie was made by Cyberdine?Last time I gave it a 8/10. This time I give it a 9/10.",9,1,2,10 October 2015

","I'm disappointed. As a non-fan of the 'X-Men' series, I actually really liked 'X-Men: First Class (2011)', but this movie is quite a mess. It's not terrible, but it's not very good either and not nearly as good as the previous one.The best thing about this movie is, without doubt, QuickSilver: Great use of the character, nice visuals and the actor (which I'm not familiar with) is just excellent and fits the role perfectly. I enjoyed pretty much every scene with him.James McAvoy totally reminded me of Rik Mayall.The whole past/future plot was a big disappointment. I expected something a lot more interesting and sophisticated. It seemed like a pretty lousy excuse to mix both generations of characters.",5,1,2,9 October 2015
Jackie," Extremely uncomfortable to watch
","This movie has the worst score I've ever heard in my life. Seriously. It reminds me of a military siren. Just awful.I find Natalie Portman's acting and especially her accent extremely unnatural and distracting. Sorry, but I think it's far from an Oscar worthy performance.The entire movie feels extremely uncomfortable to watch. You need to see it yourself to understand what I'm talking about. Plus, it got a strong sense of Oscar bait and I don't bite it: An entire movie revolving around one actor, reenacting events of a historical figure. And for me it fails flat. It feels like a student project.Watching the real 'White House broadcast' (which was recreated in the movie), Jackie's accent and way of talking (and general way of behavior throughout the entire broadcast) is extremely unnatural too. Still, I think Portman makes it even MORE unnatural and uncomfortable.",3,3,8,27 January 2017

What a waste of his talent, should have won an Oscar by now).Melora Walters: She took me out of the film a few times. Her acting is very uneven. She can be good and she can be lousy.All the other cast members are also good in their roles.I should probably mention that I watched the director's cut. IMO it's MUCH better than the theatrical version.I can't decide whether this movie deserves a 7/10 or a 7.5/10.

As always with Peter Jackson, Technical side is excellent but the movie has no soul and it stretches endlessly with slow speeches and scenes that are cartoonish and endless (dinosaur chase, anyone?). Why is the barrel riding sequence better than the jungle scene in 'Indiana Jones 4'?Actually, I'm amazed that I saw the whole thing - obviously I fast forward a lot - since with the previous movie(s) I gave up after 20-30 min.I wasn't impressed by the barrel scene, which I heard great reviews about.

Same goes for the 1.33:1 aspect ratio (and other numerous aspect ratios and framings during the beginning of the movie).There are so many guest appearances by great actors, that it makes the movie even more fun to watch.Good production design and film locations, pretty quick pacing (after a slow start) and fun movie to watch.The makeup on Tilda Swinton is fantastic.",5,1,3,9 October 2015

Great combination of performance and makeup by Bill Corso.I really like the interaction between Channing Tatum's and Mark Ruffalo's characters, which often communicate without any word and is just as powerful. Great stuff.Great performance, good direction. Story/script are lacking.As a fan of composer Mychael Danna, I couldn't NOT recognize the reoccurring theme, taken directly from his score to 'Capote' (also directed by Bennett Miller).I also couldn't help getting a 'Boogie Nights' vibe from this movie.",6,0,0,9 October 2015
It Follows," Good elements, but flawed
","It's refreshing to see a modern teenagers horror movie that is actually creepy, doesn't have any jump scares and is really done well: Good production, good acting, good cinematography, good score, creepy idea for a plot (I'd say it takes ideas from films like 'The Thing', 'Night of the Living Dead', 'The Terminator'/'Westworld' and 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and I guess you can consider it as an allegory for AIDS) and it takes itself seriously and doesn't insult your intelligence.Everything about this movie is good, except that it's way too slow and long. It would have worked a lot better as a short, 30 min at most. Or at least it should have been more complex and have more twists, since the plot is just too simple.The ending is very disappointing.The entire movie has an 80's feel to it, in the good way.5/10 Creepy movie, good elements, but overall it's flawed",5,12,39,20 May 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Very good re-telling
","After watching the (disappointing) trailer #2 for 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes', I felt like watching the first part again:Second watch. Very good stuff. It really balances well a story that is both moving and tells the story of the Planet of the Apes in a (sort-of) realistic way and well prepares the ground for the sequels, with lots of references to the original movie and clues to what is coming in the next movies (there is already a third movie planned).Good writing (the writers also wrote the coming sequel), excellent score by Patrick Doyle, very good CGI (although not perfect - watching it on HD reveals some of the flaws), good direction and very good performance by the cast - especially John Lithgow and Andy Serkis. James Franco is also OK in his part. And only now when watching the credits I see Brian Cox - didn't even recognize him.The earlier scenes with Caesar and Lithgow's character really moved me, so good job on that too.The last scene really had a 'Twelve Monkeys' vibe.I always thought the sequels to the original movie absolutely destroyed everything that was good about it (the original movie) and that they made no sense and were pointless: The story in the sequels, of 'apes getting smarter' and 'apes revolting' felt to me like a bad writing as an excuse for bad sequels; I always thought that 'We finally really did it. You maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell!' was clear that the humans destroyed Earth by an atomic warfare and thus it was NEVER a story about apes rising against humans and taking the world from them. Therefore, the idea of re-telling the story again, this time in 'chronological' order, can only make sense to someone who hasn't seen the original movie. Still, I let go of what I think of the original series and its sequels and chose to enjoy this movie as it is. And enjoy it I did.Last time I gave it a 6/10, this time -6.5/10 Very goodA few words about the sequel, which comes out in two months from writing this review: Can't say the second trailer looks promising. They also changed the director, but at least they kept the writers, so I don't lose hope just yet. I have to say that the trailer to 'Rise' didn't look promising either and I was pleasantly surprised. I'll wait and see.",7,2,4,9 May 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Not great, not terrible
","So what did we have? People driving, shots of Margot Robbie smiling to herself, shots of Margot Robbie's ass, endless masturbatory 1960's pop culture references a la 'Family Guy', lots of B-movie expositions, stupid plot twist, incoherent story, pointless flashbacks and scene manipulation/recreation, and an ending which is both pointless and has nothing to do with the style of the movie and is only there as a Tarantino fan service. The entire Sharon Tate (non) story was pointless and was only there to serve the ending.
I've seen worse and I wasn't bored but it's still pointless and contains endless rip offs/references to older movies and genres, like every other Tarantino movie.

","A melodrama about the life of Stephen Hawking. It's exactly what you can expect from a movie like that, but it's pretty well done. the movie focuses on the disease and the family relationships, while touching the science aspect once in a while, explaining it to the layman.Eddie Redmayne is very good in his role, convincingly playing Hawking and making the performance very believable. His looks is very to Hawking himself, so that helps too. Felicity Jones is OK in her role.Good low-key score by Johann Johannsson.I haven't checked how accurate the movie is, but it's based on a book written by his wife and according to IMDb's trivia, Stephen Hawking liked it.",6,2,2,9 October 2015

He is very good in his role and could have been nominated for a high-ranked award. I also liked Tom McCamus. Very nice low-key role. I thought I knew him from somewhere (and not just because he looks like Lou Reed) - He was in POSSIBLE WORLDS (great movie), got pretty old since then.The movie is slow and simple.

Great Norway scenery.This is a great example of how to make a minimal movie that is excellent. It reminds me of 'Moon' in that respect (although 'Moon' is better IMHO).The ending is fantastic (although I think it should have ended about two minutes earlier).I can't believe it's written and directed by the same guy who wrote stuff like 'The Beach' and 'Dredd'.I might give it an even higher rating on a second watch.7/10 Highly recommended",7,1,3,20 May 2015
1917," Technically impressive, emotionally empty
","'1917' is technically impressive. The entire movie is filmed with some clever cuts in a way that makes it look like a single shot (similar to the style of 'Birdman'). This style and the impressive sets give it a lot of realism. Unfortunately, the movie is emotionally empty (with the exception of the two scenes) and the plot is paper thin.

Pi," The best no-budget movie you'll ever see
","'Pi (1998)' is, without doubt, the best no-budget movie I've ever seen. Directed by Darren Aronofsky with a ridiculous budget of $60,000 - which I first thought was a mistake in the figures, since I couldn't believe such a movie could possibly be made with that amount of money.Most of the cast and crew later re-united to make 'Requiem for a Dream (2000)' - one of the best movies made in the last few years. Like many others, it was 'Requiem' that made me find 'Pi'. It took Aronofsky only 2 movies to become one of my favorite directors, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for this young and promising writer/director.The movie stars Sean Gullette, which co-wrote the movie with Aronofsky and Eric Watson. You might recognize him as Arnold (Marion's old partner and shrink) in 'Requiem'. Gullette is perfect in his role and does an amazing job here. It's a shame we don't see his talent in more movies.Mark Margolis (Mr. Rabinowitz in 'Requiem') is excellent as Max's mentor and all the other cast is doing a great job too.Like in 'Requiem', technical aspect is top-notch: Excellent black-and-white cinematography (Matthew Libatique) and the innovative use of the Snorricam, lightning, editing (Oren Sarch), and music (Clint Mansell, frontman for Pop will Eat itself).The director's commentary for this movie is fascinating. After hearing it you'd appreciate the effort and heart that were put into this movie a lot more.Look for guest/cameo appearances by Samia Shoaib (the nurse in 'Requiem') as Devi, Max's nextdoor neighbor; Clint Mansell (the movie's composer) as the photographer; and Abraham Aronofsky (Darren's father) as one of the men delivering the suitcase at the door.One last word. While some aspects presented in the movie - such as the Hebrew numerology and mathematical concepts - are correct (that is, the explanations of Hebrew numerology are not made-up; That _doesn't_ mean I actually believe in any of the meanings attached to them), I suggest you to use your suspension-of-disbelief instead of trying to find logic and mistakes in them.10/10",9,164,233,11 March 2003

Jurassic World," Meh
","So I watched it at the cinema. In 3D. And it's... meh...First of all, the 3D was very tiresome for my eyes. Never happened to me before, definitely not on such level. Maybe also has to do with the fact that I didn't sleep well at night and was pretty tired (almost fell asleep a few times during the movie).The movie itself is pretty boring, so basically we're left with CGI, which is pretty good, but that doesn't make a movie you enjoy watching. Lots of dinosaur action scenes, some people getting killed - but you wouldn't care for any of them.At one point I thought I was watching 'Aliens' - it was if the screenwriter took the script for 'Aliens' and used it word for word. I'm speaking of the scene in which the people at the command center are watching the 'military' guys fighting, each has his own POV camera and a heart monitor - the situation is IDENTICAL and so is pretty much the dialog too.At another point I thought I was watching 'Alien Resurrection', with the main dinosaur being a hybrid of a T-Rex, a cuttlefish, a Frog and a raptor. It's a new kind of the species, made by genetic modification/hybrid.What I mostly liked about the movie was the vision of 'Jurassic World' as a fully working theme park. It had some nice touches there, with some nice attractions, some of them are just as gimmicky/clichéd as you'd expect from a theme park.Of the cast, Chris Pratt is the only one doing a worthy acting job. Vincent D'Onofrio wastes his amazing talent, as expected.It was actually a noon-screening, so there were lots of children too, which seemed to enjoy it although I thought some scenes could too intense/scary for them.All in all, it's an average movie at best.",4,4,11,14 September 2015

It's not, it's a thriller. I'm not going to say anything about the plot, only that I didn't find it very satisfactory and I didn't feel everything 'fell into place' at the end (actually, I'm not sure I understand what were the parts of all the people involved and what the point of the movie was). Also, I think the writer had some influence from The Vanishing. It felt like a mish-mash of ideas from several thriller movies.Good acting by the entire cast, especially Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Paul Dano (even Terrence Howard was bearable; and man, Maria Bello got old! She looks at least in her 50's), good low-key score by Johann Johannsson. I was surprised to see that the DP was Roger Deakins - his cinematography is usually more impressive.All in all, it's an OK movie, but lacking, with plot that is full of holes and stuff that leads nowhere. I don't understand how it got such a high rating on IMDb.",5,0,1,10 October 2015
The Artist," The Artist
","The movie is a mix between The Call of Cthulhu (2005), Ed Wood (1994), Chaplin (1992) and Sunset Blvd. (1950). It takes place around 1930 and tells the story of silent movie star that has to deal with the introduction of film sound and talking movies. The movie itself is made like a silent movie from that period and the technical side is great (although they didn't go so far as The Call of Cthulhu did in 'aging' the film; also, notice that only the early scenes are sped-up a bit like the old movies).The entire production value is excellent (scenery, clothing, makeup, cars, houses), making the movie feel very authentic right from the start. Solid direction, good cast and excellent score (totally deserves the Golden Globe it got). My only complaint is that movie didn't maintain the amount of interest I felt in its beginning; I don't know if I should blame the script or the director, but more than once I felt that I'm losing my interest. Perhaps some scenes were just too long.IMHO this movie doesn't come close to the level of Ed Wood, but all in all it's a good film and I recommend it.5.5/10 Recommended",6,2,9,20 January 2012
Life Is Beautiful," Life Is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella) (1997)
","Life Is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella) (1997) Released 13 years ago, but I only saw it now for the first time. I hate to say it, but... what a waste of time.I lost interest about 20 minutes into the movie, then fast-forward the rest. I don't get the point of the movie. It doesn't work as a comedy: first of all because Benigni is just annoying (yeah, I used to love some of his movies once too. Now I find it annoying) and secondly because we get the point of 'presenting the holocaust to your son as a game' and there's no need to drag it for another hour. However, the movie doesn't work as a drama/educational either: It just doesn't seem to take any of the situations seriously and it doesn't show the horrors of the holocaust. In particular, I don't get the entire first half of the movie - it doesn't have to do with the rest of the movie at all.I didn't really find the movie offensive, just... a waste of a filmmaker's time and effort. It's funny that Benigni chose the prison camp uniform to have the same number as Charles Chaplin's uniform in 'The Great Dictator (1940)', as I wanted to give Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator (1940)' as the example of how to make a masterpiece, dealing with the same subject - while making a comedy. Yeah, it's not easy to make a comedy about the holocaust, especially if you want to make a point and have some serious under-layers. In comparison to 'The Great Dictator', I would say that 'Life Is Beautiful' is quite offensive - making fun of the situation instead of letting the viewer feel the horror and seriousness of it.Let me give you a simple example from 'The Great Dictator' to make my point: <ul><li>'How many were going to strike?' - 'Three thousand of them.' - 'Have them all shot. I don't want dissatisfied workers.'</li></ul>This is one of my favorite bits. It's so funny, yet Chaplin didn't put it just for the joke - he put it there to show how cruel the Dictator is and REALLY teach about the situation and conditions. Benigni does just the opposite: He makes stuff up just for the sake of being funny - I couldn't find any value in his jokes or in the script in general.To sum it all up, Chaplin entertains the viewers while at the same time letting them feel and understand the horror. Benigni completely detaches the viewers from the situation and his entire purpose is to make them laugh. Comparing Benigni to Chaplin is like comparison DreamWorks to Pixar.I honestly don't understand how this movie got so many praises.2/10 Horrible. Go watch 'The Great Dictator' to learn how to handle this subject.",2,5,12,16 January 2011
Groundhog Day," Harold Ramis and Bill Murray in top shape
","I've seen this movie 4 or 5 times since the first time I had seen it in cinema, and it's still fabulous. This is a super-funny, well-written comedy with a heart. In someone else's hands it could have easily got 'lost', but Harold Ramis keeps the movie interesting and funny all the way through, and squeezes (in the good way) the possibilities of the story to full potential.",8,0,0,19 September 2001
Sicario," Two hours of foreplay without a climax
","This movie is a borefest from beginning to end, with a few breaks for some action scenes in between. It's painfully slow and you keep waiting for the tension to lead somewhere, but it just keeps on and on like that without any real goal.Emily Blunt's character has exactly two reactions: When she's outside she behaves like a little girl on a field trip, and when she's indoors she's agonized like she just performed a 12-hours brain surgery. These two reactions keep repeating alternately throughout the movie and needless to say that neither of them fits a character which supposed to be a fighter with a lot of field experience.There are only two redeeming factors in this movie: A few short action scenes and Benicio Del Toro.How this movie got a rating of 8.1/10 on IMDb is beyond me. People claimed this is one of the best movies of the year. For me, it's a total failure.",4,8,19,22 October 2015
In Time," Like chewing a bubblegum
","I was actually looking forward to this movie, since I like the director's previous films 'Gattaca' and 'Lord of War'.The plot: A future society in which time replaces money. People after the age of 25 are given one year to live and then they have to earn their additional time, without getting older than 25 (interestingly enough, almost all the actors in the movie ARE over 25).An original (well, not really, they got sued) but simple idea that isn't developed all that well during the movie and serves as an allegory to capitalism, with all the in-your-face consequences you're expecting.This movie is like chewing bubblegum: You enjoy it, you continue to chew it even after the flavor has gone and when you finish it you know you chewed it way too long.Except for Cillian Murphy, I'd have replaced the entire cast. Justin Timberlake is not bad, but... he'll always stay Justin in my mind, a boys-band singer, not an actor. And Johnny Galecki... it just feels too weird to accept him now as anything other than Leonard from 'The Big Bang Theory'. Same goes for the other actors who were just average.5/10 Worth watching",5,1,5,3 December 2011
The Witch," Highly recommended
","This movie is all about atmosphere. Fantastic cinematography, acting by the entire small cast, production, low key score. It's extremely slow, but worth watching for the excellent and unique atmosphere the director managed to create. The language and locations help that too. No stupid jump scares in this one, just a good old classic horror. The plot is based on folklore tales and for me it was secondary to the enjoyment of the film - just put your brains in neutral, don't try to find any sense in was is happening and you'll enjoy it.The cinematography, although rather 'static', was simply breathtaking. It reminded me of BARRY LYNDON (1975) and COME AND SEE (1985). I don't know what equipment and techniques they used, but the result is excellent.",6,0,1,10 August 2016
Rosemary's Baby," A lacking classic
","I vaguely remember watching this film.I know you're gonna hate me for it, but I wasn't blown by the film. Something was missing for me. Perhaps with a better score (I wanted SO MUCH to hear Wojciech Kilar's 'The Storm' track from Dracula during the rape scene and the scene at the end we she approaches her baby for the first time) or more suitable actors. Maybe it's the script that is lacking. I think the psychological element should have been handled better, making the ambiguity (of whether this is real or all in her head) a lot more prominent for Rosemary and for the viewers.IMO, the best thing in the movie is Ruth Gordon, who does an excellent job as Minnie, the old neighbor (and won an Oscar for it).",7,0,0,10 October 2015
The Secret Life of Pets," For kids only
","Illumination Entertainment started well with DESPICABLE ME and going downhill from there. They keep shoving their Minions to everything - there's a 5 min short Minions movie before the 'feature movie'. Then, their movies always try to be 'super cute', there's something annoying about their latest movies. Previously it was DreamWorks that used to release movies with the same subject as Pixar. Now it's Illumination, coming up with a movie about animals life at the same time ZOOTOPIA comes out. This movie starts well, but quickly changes direction and goes all over the place. I completely lost interest after less than 20 min and didn't even want to keep watching it. ZOOTOPIA is, without doubt, a much better movie.

","A once-famous movie star is trying to regain recognition by adapting, directing and acting in a theater play.The entire movie is made up of very long continuous scenes, stitched together seamlessly.I think Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is overrated. I saw 4 of his previous movies and they were OK (I rated them between 5/10 and 7/10), but not nearly as amazing as people make them. Still, I had very high hopes from this movie, after all the reviews and award nominations.Well, I'm disappointed. I felt very disconnected from the characters, felt nothing much is happening in the movie and wasn't too impressed by the acting.",5,5,9,9 October 2015
The Big Short," Bad, watch MARGIN CALL instead
","A little before 2008, investors think the subprime market is going to crash so they bet against it. That's it, that's the plot of the movie and it's repeated over and over and over again. The result is just as boring as it sounds.The only thing that raises this movie above a complete BOREFEST is having lots of A-list actors playing atypical roles, especially Christian Bale.This movie is just bad. If you want to see a GOOD movie about the 2008 crash, watch the excellent MARGIN CALL (2011) and especially Jeremy Irons in top shape - excellent acting with excellent dialog.",3,0,1,23 July 2016
Prometheus," Prometheus (2012)
","Saw the 3D version yesterday at the cinema and for objectivity's sake, I'm writing this review before reading any other review.'Prometheus' is the only movie I've watched at the cinema in 3D since 'Avatar' and it only comes to show how brilliant 'Avatar' was. 'Avatar''s 3D technology wasn't only revolutionary, but it was used brilliantly in the 3D space of the movie, with constant camera moves on all axes and with flying objects. You really felt like you're flying. In addition, the entire environment was very '3D' - not just 2 or 3 planes (as in 'surface'), but multi-plane with trees and objects coming from every angle and great use of picture depth. In 'Prometheus' you have nothing of that - the 3D technology is nothing more than 'nice' and it adds almost nothing to the experience of watching the movie. Nobdody can come close to James Cameron's technical skills and 'Avatar' stays a brilliant piece of technology achievement.Now, the movie itself: Technical side was nice and the visual effects were very well handled. In terms of thrill I was quite disappointed: It was nothing as thrilling or exciting as any of the other 'Alien' movies - I constantly waited for something 'big' to happen and nothing really did. The very ending was rather good, but it doesn't make up for 2 hours of 'something is going to happen' without any delivery.As for the plot, it was weird and a bit mixed-up. I liked some of the ideas there, but basically it felt like a mash-potato that tries to tie things up and finish with what we saw in 'Alien'. It felt like the prequel to 'The Thing' - it was interesting to watch, but it ignored some of the ideas of the original movie and even ruined some of the stuff we imagined in our mind. For example: The 'Space Jockey' wasn't even a living thing, it was just a space-suit; The stress-call/warning signal wasn't made by aliens, but by humans; And the thing I have the biggest problem with: How come the 'Alien' is born in eggs if it was actually created by fusing (twice) with human DNA?Will there be a sequel to the prequel? Perhaps. Basically, the ending of this movie seems to tie the plot to the beginning of 'Alien', so there's nothing more to add there. On the other hand, they conveniently left another plot open: The search for the 'Engineers' and the reason for creating, then trying to destroy humanity on earth.All in all, the movie was fun to watch, but it doesn't come close to the level of 'Alien' and 'Aliens'. I recommend you watching the movie - 2D version is enough.5.5/10 Recommended",6,1,3,20 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," A waste of good talents
","What a mess. This is one of Nolan's weakest movies and definitely the worst in the Batman trilogy.I didn't expect much from the trailer, but it was even worse than I thought. It's not terrible, but it's not a good film either.The characters were uninteresting, plot was a mess, lots of useless fighting scenes. Tom Hardy's talent was wasted and Bane character isn't even 1% as strong or as interesting as the Joker. Most of all I liked Michael Caine's performance, but that was brief and the editor rushed his few scenes too.Oh, and the movie is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long. Did they really need 3 hours to tell this mess???",3,3,4,10 October 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Some good elements but even more bad elements
","It's been a long time since I've seen such an uneven movie. There are some good elements, but mainly bad elements - and nothing adds up.It's a mess and the plot goes to all different directions without aim. It's like they had some good elements and they threw it here and there; it feels like scenes don't have any connection between them. There are so many flaws to this movie that I wouldn't know where to start. The motivation of Batman, Superman and Lex are very unclear and unrealistic to me. 3/4 into the movie and Wonder Woman only had about 3 lines.But the worst thing for me in this movie is that every time I think 'Hey, this is kind of smart/cool and they did it well', the movie takes a sharp turn and ruins it with pumping bad elements.The battle of Batman vs. Superman feels just awkward - the motivation is missing (I don't see any reason for them to actually fight, although the writers tried to find some excuses for that) and it feels like a battle written for fans, trailers and to justify the movie's title.Here are some of the things I like about this movie: Jesse Eisenberg - I'm not a fan of him, but just like you see in the trailers, he's an interesting character and Eisenberg plays him rather well with his weird behavior. I think he's doing a good job in this role.Jeremy Irons - Alfred is not just a mentor anymore, but an actual helper. His character is different from the previous versions and Irons played his well. How is he in comparison to Caine? You can't compare the two of them - their characters are just too different.Ben Affleck - Again, I'm not a fan, but he's OK in his role. His character is written very flat IMHO, so he doesn't make a huge or memorable impact.I like the approach of trying to make a 'down to Earth' realistic movie. It feels like they were trying to say: What would really happen in today's world if characters like Superman and Batman actually existed.I also like the way the writers took the previous movie and connected it to this one in several elements, mainly the reason for Batman to hate Superman. Again, it's a good idea and I like it, but it doesn't seem like a good explanation to explain it.The religion references are very explicit here and for the first time I actually like them because they 'realistically' discuss the implications of Superman being a semi-god.The last quarter of the movie is pretty bad and it ends with the usual mess you're familiar with in these kind of movies.With so much publicity for Wonder Woman, it's almost hard to believe that her part in the movie is more or less what you see in the trailers.This is a 2.5 hours movie that feels like 5 hours.",5,2,4,23 July 2016
Son of Saul," Worth watching
","Oscar winner: Best Foreign Language Film of the Year - HungarySaul is a Sonderkommando, a prisoner in a Nazi death camp, working in unloading bodies from the gas chamber.The movie has a unique style. It's shot in 1.37:1 AR, all hand-held following Saul in extreme close-up, his face taking almost half the screen in shallow focus, making everything that happens in the background shown out of focus, almost the entire movie. It gives a claustrophobic feeling and focus on the lead character, almost like a third-person perspective, almost being a part with the actor as things happen in the background, somewhat detached from the horror around him. Some of the scenes are very long continuous takes (such as the first shot of the movie, 3.5 minutes long).Production value is good, making the film seem quite authentic, although hard to grasp everything due to the out of focus shots during the entire movie.The story felt quite shallow and the motivation of the lead character still remains unclear and illogical to me. In the end, the plot felt empty and missing. It felt like a small story, but its importance was showing some of the terrible things that happened in the death camp.In addition, the main character is a Sonderkommando, working with the Kapo and basically collaborating with the Nazis in order to save himself in a somewhat selfish way while watching masses of people being murdered like animals. He's part of the Nazi machine that lies to the victims in order to keep them calm just before killing them. Obviously, it makes it much harder for the viewer to identify and feel empathy for the character.All in all, I expected a lot more from this movie. I expected a more profound story and in that respect I'm disappointed. I also expected to be a lot more moved, but the movie kept you pretty detached from the feelings, in addition to feeling ambiguous for the main character (as I mentioned above). On the other hand, they managed to recreate quite an authentic atmosphere and production value is very good.I felt a bit of influence from COME AND SEE (1985) (especially toward the end of the movie) and based on IMDb's trivia, the director indeed cited that movie as an inspiration.",6,1,3,23 July 2016
Lucy," Meh
","Pompous 'Sci-Fi' thriller that tries to present itself as something smart and based on facts and scientific theories (hey, it has MORGAN FREEMAN lecturing, so it MUST be smart and true!). In actuality, it's really silly movie, completely fabricated and hardly original. It's a mix between movies like 'Lawnmower Man', 'The Terminator' and 'The Matrix' and you'll have to put your brains in complete neutral and fully trust your suspension of disbelief.This movie could have been a lot more enjoyable if it DIDN'T try to present itself and something smart and based on facts. It would have worked a lot better as a fabricated Sci-Fi that doesn't take itself seriously.I was surprised to (re-)discover that it's made by Luc Besson, since I expected a lot more originality and sophistication from him - and there's hardly any of either in this movie.Part of its 'sophistication' is using Asian location and cast. Wait, they are in Taiwan but they all speak Korean?! Min-sik Choi ('Oldboy') is good as usual, but he's capable of much more.Question: 1. Any reason to use an Egyptian actor as a French cop? 2. Any reason movies still show mobiles that are non-smartphones? I haven't seen people using these phones in the last 5 years but movies keep showing them for some reason.Did I mention the SHAMELESS product placement for Samsung? It's EVERYWHERE: Mobiles, TVs, cameras, printers. Every product in the movie is by Samsung.The ending feels like a B-movie.",4,1,5,9 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Enjoyable
","Well, it was OK. Not bad, but not amazing either. Definitely better than any of the prequels, but it doesn't really say much. It's good to see the series getting back to the 'roots', with more actual sets and puppets and less green screens. The movie feels like a continuation of the original trilogy, for good and for bad. And there are lots of nods and characters from the original movie, so fanboys would have a blast.Now for super-minor spoilers (nothing that would ruin the movie): Harrison Ford - I didn't expect him to have such a major role. It was a nice surprise. Chewbacca - I don't believe for a minute that it was Peter Mayhew under the costume. The guy can hardly walk. There's no way he could have done that. Carrie Fisher - She looks like a 100 years old. And I don't know what kind of operation her face went through, but it seems she can hardly move a muscle when she speaks. Mark Hamill - The guy dropped 23 kg at age 64 only to appear for a few seconds? Man, what a disappointment. Daisy Ridley - Damn, this girl is cute. I didn't like the feminist propaganda when introducing her, but it was brief. Black Guy - Serving as a token. He was OK.As for the flaws, I won't start listing everything. I'll just mention two things that were obvious: 1. Coincidences. Amazing. It's like the huge universe is made of one room and everybody meets everyone else just in time. 2. As expected, lots of scenes that were a rehash of previous movies, especially the original Star Wars.All in all it was a watchable and enjoyable movie. Nothing amazing and I don't think I'll watch it again.",4,5,13,23 July 2016
Unbroken," Worth watching
","A war movie, directed by Angelina Jolie. The true story of an American Olympic runner, who took part in WWII. He was lost at sea and was later a prisoner of war.Impressive (perhaps - read what I wrote later) direction by Angelina Jolie. Good performance by Jack O'Connell.The biggest flaw in the movie is the makeup: It's terrible and takes you out of the movie. How persons who spend a month at sea have neat hair and tiny beard that looks like they just went to the barber? Same goes for the POW period, especially with the coal - it looks completely fake (and it seems I'm not the only one thinking that).Another flaw is that I didn't feel an 'impact' by this movie. All the elements are there, but somehow it doesn't have a 'punch'. I'm not sure whether it's a problem of writing or direction. Perhaps both.And one more thing: Many movies I watched during this weekend have the tendency to give long flashbacks, especially the youth period of the person. It's really annoying. I understand a short flashback, but why do they keep doing those long flashbacks? Why don't they tell the story in linear order? So annoying.The movie reminded me of other POW movies, especially 'Rescue Dawn (2006)' and 'Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (1983)' - and coincidentally both movies feature a pop star in a major role. It also reminded me of 'Memphis Belle' (and a little of 'Life of Pi').Side note: Isn't it a weird choice to cast two English men for major roles as Americans soldiers?Reading the other reviews, it seems that people really hated this movie. I'm not sure why. It's not a great movie and it has its flaws, but I expected this kind of material to get overrated ratings and award nominations.",5,0,0,9 October 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Hunger Games - The Remake!
","Catching Fire is basically a remake of the first movie, which doesn't offer even one single new idea, just the easiest excuse to send the winning couple back to the games and repeat everything that happened in the first movie.At 2.5 hours (including 11 min of end credits!!!), the movie is way too long and pointless. Half the movie is wasted on boring 'background story', which adds nothing to the plot and serves as a mean to present the movie as something more than it is - people trying to kill each other. The second half is better, but again - offers nothing new.Good production design, good CGI.4.5/10 Skip the first half of the movie, then put your brains in neutralWait, they split the third movie into two movies, making the trilogy into a quadrilogy?

And it handles extremely well the subject of cancer without getting too clichéd.The entire cast is fantastic: Joseph Gordon-Levitt proves again that he's a great actor and still takes risks in choosing interesting roles; Anjelica Huston proves that she's still a fantastic actress; Seth Rogen, although not very different than his usual type-casted role, is actually pretty good; And Anna Kendrick is amazingly cute. Bryce Dallas Howard and especially Matt Frewer and Philip Baker Hall are all great in their supporting roles.With solid direction and good script, this movie is one of the better movies I've seen from 2011.

The environment is very stylish and real, as opposed to movies such as 'Oz the Great and Powerful' and 'Alice in Wonderland' where the environment is totally fake CGI.Excellent visuals, sets, cinematography, editing, score, makeup and creatures.The only dull moments were the scenes with the queen - other than that the movie has everything a good action movie needs.I'm not a comics-fan, but this is a great comics adaptation.",8,2,5,10 October 2015
Minions," For kids only
","OK, so I understand I'm not exactly the target audience for this movie. And I never liked the minions, even as sidekicks in the original 'Despicable Me' movies - from the moment I saw them I considered them a failed attempt in making cute sidekicks. Everything that was great about Scrat (the squirrel) from 'Ice Age' was done badly with the minions. I hoped to see them less and less, but unfortunately they decided to make an entire spin-off dedicated to them.The movie has kids humor and some of the worst narration I've ever experienced: Not only is it poorly written and delivered (can't tell whether this is Geoffrey Rush's fault or the director's) but the thing is that it's completely needless. There is simply no need to narrate the obvious. Again, I understand the target audience is kids, but even THEY don't need such a narration for such a simple story.",4,1,6,14 September 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Worth watching at the cinema
","Well, that was... weird.Raw, brutal, grotesque, bizarre, surreal, savage, pure adrenaline. This is just non-stop car chases and action. Great visuals, great score, great production, makeup, scenery, stunts and practical effects. Plot is thin as paper - and yet Charlize Theron manages to shine and do a great job, while Tom Hardy is almost transparent.My main critique (other than the thin plot) has to do with the editing. Like in many action movies these days, the editing just just ultra-fast, to the point you can't really understand what's going on and your eyes get really tired (combined with the theater's air condition). I can see why someone wrote that it's better to watch it in 2D before watching it in 3D.The grotesque angle reminded me of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's style, mixed with 'The Name of the Rose' (Jean-Jacques Annaud), 'Judge Dredd' and '300'.All the audience had the same look on their face: 'WTF did I just watch???'All in all, this is a decent movie. Just put your brains in neutral (no pun intended) and enjoy the visuals and the rush.",8,2,7,28 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Worth watching on the big screen
","The first part of the movie was absolutely terrible. Full of clichés, religious nonsense and a love story less believable than the one in STAR WARS EPISODE 2. If the movie continued like that I would have probably given it a 3/10 or a 4/10.Then comes the military part of movie and it was just excellent. I don't remember seeing such believable war scenes since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Excellent sound, excellent score, great war pyrotechnics, good cinematography.I wasn't impressed by Andrew Garfield's acting. His constant silly smile is so annoying. Ignoring the smile, he was OK in his role - not more, not less. If you manage to ignore the awful first part of the movie and Mel Gibson's regular nonstop religious themes, you better try to catch this movie at the cinema if it's still playing - that's a movie to watch on a big screen with good sound.As much as I hate Mel Gibson on a personal basis, this was a good movie, if just for the authentic war scenes.Vince Vaughn, who I usually hate, was surprisingly good (perhaps the best actor in this movie) and it took me a while to recognize him. Although the military training had some FULL METAL JACKET ripoff vibe, he was good on his role.",6,3,13,15 December 2016
Contact," Science vs. Faith
","Contact (1997), directed by Robert Zemeckis may be a Sci-Fi movie, but for me it's first of all a philosophical one. If you expect an action movie with UFO's, such as Independence Day (1996), then you picked the wrong movie.
The movie's main theme is science vs. faith, and its moral is that there are things in life that one must accept without a proof. It raises questions like the existence of god, the existence of intelligent life somewhere in the universe, where we came from and what we're doing on earth (as a good example for taking some of these elements and ruining them, see K-PAX (2001)). Technical aspect is top-notch: Excellent direction (Robert Zemeckis), cinematography (Don Burgess), music (Alan Silvestri, Zemeckis' regular), script (based on the novel by late astronomer Carl Sagan), sound, editing and breath-taking special effects - while a great portion of them is 'natural' and hard to notice. The impressive cast includes Jodie Foster (in an Oscar-worthy performance), Tom Skerritt, David Morse, James Woods, Angela Bassett, Jake Busey, the fabulous John Hurt, the always-annoying Matthew McConaughey, and many other guests. 8.5/10",8,8,17,22 October 2002
The Martian," Roland Emmerich directs SAVING PRIVATE RYAN vs. INTERSTELLAR
","(Contains minor spoilers, nothing that would ruin the movie)The movie is a joke. It is currently rated 8.3/10 on IMDb, taking #134 at the top 250 - and it's not even funny.If you expect a sophisticated movie, you're in the wrong place. This movie seems to be written by kids or intended for them. The script is ridiculous, spoon-fed to the audience and repeats everything twice in case they still didn't get it. Every character in this movie is stupid and one-dimensional. It features silly jokes and moronic behavior which you haven't seen astronauts do since PROMETHEUS.This movie wants you to believe that an astronaut left alone on Mars finds out by himself time after time ways to keep alive. It wants you to believe that astronauts were sent to a mission to Mars without taking into consideration that something could go wrong, they didn't think of ways to grow food or survive on Mars and didn't train the astronauts or gave them basic instructions book for a case of emergency. They simply left it to the astronauts to figure it out by themselves in a case of emergency. And voilà - when something like that happens, one astronaut invents endless ways to survive - something that all of NASA's scientists didn't think of before. This guy should have made billions in making his own startups.In MOON - one of the best movies in recent years - they put a computer so that the main character is kept isolated from society but has someone/something to talk to, thus sharing his thoughts and feelings for the viewer.In THE MARTIAN, on the other hand, the character simply talks to himself. Yes, most of the time he talks to the camera, but not always. When he does, he talks as if he were explaining stuff to a 6-year old. I expect an astronaut to leave behind a vlog intended for his peers, who should know a thing or two when coordinating a multi-billion mission into Mars. I don't expect him to talk like he's explaining this to his kid.Characters don't only think like kids, act and explain like kids, but they also make their own decisions - again and again - like this multi- billion mission was their own private game. From taking over a space vehicle, through sending hidden messages against the commander's decision, to sharing country secrets. This is beyond ridiculous. This is straight B-movie material.Just like in INTERSTELLAR, Jessica Chastain again has to save Matt Damon who was left alone on a far away planet. There's nothing much I can add to that.I simply refuse to believe this movie was directed by the same guy who directed ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER. This is 100% a Roland Emmerich job. From the poorly directed acting and script, to the ridiculous crowd scenes at the end. This is pure Emmerich. If tomorrow the studio would publish that they pranked us and used Ridley Scott's name, but actually Emmerich is the one who directed this film, I wouldn't be surprised at all.I said it several times before and I'll say it again: Jessica Chastain and Kate Mara simply can't act. They are awful actresses and should only appear in B-movies. Chastain's acting makes it impossible for you to believe, even for one minute, that she's the team's captain. She acts like a girl on a field trip. And Kate Mara is Kate Mara, no need to add anything to that.As for the visuals, which got such praising reviews - well, they are OK. Nothing astounding, definitely not after we've seen GRAVITY. There are some nice zero-gravity shots, but frequently it seemed to me like wire work and the movement wasn't nearly as clean and natural as what we've seen in Gravity. Same goes for the movement in space (both in the ship and outside) - frequently it seemed to ignore the laws of physics.Matt Damon is pretty good in his role, but the silly script and direction ruin that too.All in all, this is a big disappointment. The film is watchable, but only if you shut your brain completely off and try to watch it like a kids movie. If you try to find any logic or sophistication, like I did, you'll have a hard time enjoying this movie.",5,22,48,21 October 2015
Furious 7," Watch the scene starting at the 40 min mark. Skip the rest.
","I'm not following the series and I'm not sure how to rate such a moronic movie, so I'll just rate it based on entertainment value.All the talking and background 'story' is boring and you can skip all of that.When it comes to the few major action scenes, it's better. There are some nice chases and stunts. However, there are 2 major problems with them: 1. 'Michael Bay' extreme close-ups and extremely fast editing which sometimes doesn't even let you understand what is going on in the scene. 2. It's all so over-over-over-the-top that it's completely unrealistic and unbelievable. Cars and people survive giant crashes and falls, everything fits in place by mere chance again and again. Yeah, it happens in every action movie, but not so over the top - there's a limit to the suspension of disbelief, even in this kind of movie. Needless to say, there's no real tension since you know the good guys will always survive/win and the bad guys will always lose - but that's nothing new either.All in all, the few major action scenes are entertaining, yet extremely unrealistic and sometimes hard to follow. Everything else is not even worth mentioning.So, the highlight of the movie is a long chase scene starting at the 40 min mark and lasts 20 min - and it's more or less the only reason to even consider watching this movie.One more thing: I'm not sure how much Paul Walker had to film before dying, but I was surprised to see that he was left as a main character throughout the entire movie! So either he filmed most of his stuff, or they did a very good job with body doubles (including his two brothers) and CGI. Being non-PC, I have to say that Walker's death added a lot of publicity to this film and will probably have a great contribution to its success - I myself didn't follow the series, yet watched this one.",Null,1,17,9 October 2015
