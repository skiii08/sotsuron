Conquest 1453," Religious fanaticism and Islam propaganda
","Here a few 'facts' that can be learned from the movie:<ul><li>The Fall of Constantinople was predicted and even ordered by the prophet Mohamed himself some 1000 years before it happened!</li></ul><ul><li>After desperate failures to conquer the city, it's the dream of some holy man that made the last battle successful.</li></ul><ul><li>The first suicide bombing with happened there. Committed by athlete heroes while shouting 'Allah Akbar'.</li></ul><ul><li>The Mehmed II himself, and his army are all glorious heroes while the defenders are ugly cowards.</li></ul><ul><li>The words 'Allah Akbar' can inspire anyone, anywhere, and for doing absolutely anything.</li></ul>The good thing about this movie is that it encourages to learn from other sources about the Fall of Constantinople. Here is what I've learned from wikipedia: <ul><li>Thousands of civilians executed or enslaved during and after this battle.</li></ul><ul><li>Impalement was one of the favorite types of killing prisoners by the Ottomans.</li></ul><ul><li>The army defending Constantinople was about 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreigners.</li></ul><ul><li>At the onset of the siege probably 50,000 people were living within the walls.</li></ul><ul><li>The Ottomans' army totalled about 100,000 men</li></ul><ul><li>They built a huge cannon that weighted 32 tons, and required 700 men to operate. Although ridiculous, it actually worked, and probably was the thing that made this siege successful (not the prediction of their prophet or a dream of a true believer).</li></ul>Personally, I don't care much about who wins in religious wars (and this movie insists it was such), and I don't care to whom the Constantinople belongs. But I wonder how people in 21-st century can make such propaganda, and how others can like it.The authors didn't forget to put an awfully sentimental love story in this film. Is this what what made this film international?Update (after watching the last 20 minutes of the movie).The survived civilians were very happy to meet their conqueror Mehmed II in the city. They smile and admire the great Sultan. To leverage the effect, the last minute of the film shows a beautiful little girl, playing with his fake beard in a grotesque North Korea style. This scene is supposed to make your eyes wet.The Byzantine Emperor died while fighting among the soldiers, but the film tells nothing about the circumstances of his death. However, it tells that the Sultan generously allows to bury the Emperor according to local traditions. Well, this is almost true, ~93% truth. Because only the body was buried. The head of the Emperor was placed separately, in a public place, probably the local hippodrome.",1,68,130,22 September 2012
The Iron Giant," A talent confused by communist propaganda
","The Incredibles was my favorite movie, then Incredibles 2. So I decided to watch another Brad Bird's movie, The Iron Giant.It's brilliant, but from the first scene till the end it's a very sneaky communist propaganda. Why sneaky? Because it isn't too explicit, but If you know nothing about Soviet Union (for instance, if you are a kid!), you would think that it's a paradise on Earth. A paradise where people wish to live a different life, but being threatened with nukes by USA.Can someone be so talented in something that it comes on the account on other abilities? Like an ability to read? People didn't live in USSR a different life because they wanted to, definitely not all of them. How one can know that? It's simple: people were executed for just an attempt to leave it (like in any other commie regime in history - what a surprise). Isn't it enough to derive everything else from it?I really love all 3 movies. But after watching The Iron Giant I will not recommend them to anyone, not even Incredibles 2. Because like me, they may like it and may decide to watch The Sneaky Commie Iron Giant. But unlike me they may not be born in USSR or may not know what it is for some other reasons, like being kids.",2,2,18,29 June 2018
