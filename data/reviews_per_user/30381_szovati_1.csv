It," 2nd Most Overrated Horror Movie
","::Possible Spoiler Alert:::I think Hollywood is so desperate for hits, they pump up anything thing that's semi half decent - such as this film and Get Out. Also, I don't know who finds some of these movies 'scary'. I've never seen a list of horror movies so terrible - 'The Babadook'. LOL! Seriously?As for this film, it was OK. I didn't read any book nor am I a book vs. movie critic. But I do remember vaguely the original film in which the victims started out as kids and ended up being terrorized once again as adults. Being over a 2 hour movie, I'm waiting and waiting for the transition. The end comes. credits roll and SURPRISE! At the end of this film it is announced that this is just part 1 - they decided to make this a possible franchise. So desperate for money anymore everything must be made into endless sequels for movie goers with OCD.That being said, the movie was slightly better than the original. The cast was good and the clown a little more ferocious than his silly TV predecessor. Unfortunately, because they decided to stretch this film out, like Peter Jacksons Hobbit series, there are maybe 2 killings which is a let down from the very well done opening scene.",6,1,2,1 November 2017
