50 First Dates," Simple message for life.
","Keep it simple Stup**...That's the point here. It's about our relationships with family and friends that really matter. Adam working a character who is foot loose and fancy free bamboozling women for a good time and moving on...Typical singular episode for both menfolk and womenfolk alike....especially in 2018.....Adam meets Drew, has a revelation, and everything changes for the better with a lesson learned......Good happy time movie.",8,1,1,10 May 2018
Halloween," Simply the best Horror Movie ever made...
","When reviewing, thinking about or rating all horror movies everything starts from Halloween and goes down from there. For me Halloween is horror movie perfection at its finest. To this day, even after 40 years, just seeing an advertisement or promotion for Halloween with Michael Myers face automatically sends that eerie tune playing in my head and Jamie Lee looking out the window. A must see for any horror movie fan.",10,0,2,29 October 2018
Black Panther," Most undeservingly overhyped movie of all time??
","Subpar to say the least. Political partisanship has now cemented its ugly head into almost every movie being delivered for mass consumption. Most moviegoers such as myself take in a flick to escape today's overt political nonsense and everybody's got an agenda world we live in........even if only for a couple hours. Forget about it. Not going to happen. For me there is so much effort to preach (as that's what it is) a particular political viewpoint that it totally interferes with story and character development. Because of this I found Black Panther almost unbearable and struggled to make it to the end. Besides that, technically the CGI was wayyyy off and character development severely compromised. Just awful. Possibly the most undeservingly overhyped movie of all time.",1,949,1798,16 February 2018
The Greatest Showman," Awesome Must See
",Went into this movie expecting a let down as the majority of movies highly recommended for me end up on the short end of a good flick. This was an excellent exception. Secondly (and on purpose) I wasn't told about the frequency of singing which beforehand would have been met with reservations. So cool viewing this movie worked out the way it did. One of those movies which is easily recommended. I would have to say my favorite number was the first between Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron,9,0,1,20 January 2018
