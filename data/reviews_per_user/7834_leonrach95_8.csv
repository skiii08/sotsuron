Casablanca," 'Round up the unusual suspects'
","Casablanca is a beautifully written movie. Anyone watching this can relate to the characters due to the fact that its about a man and a woman in love, and forfeit their love for a greater purpose. The cast, the plot, and the direction of this movie make it one of a kind and all around brilliant. Bogart and Bergman create a love that keeps you on your toes and makes you feel like you're experience what they're experiencing with them. The way they talk to each other and the expressions they give towards each other makes you feel like these characters truly are in love with each other. With the tight budget that they were placed under for this movie they did an excellent job with the production of it.",7,1,4,18 October 2014
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane is a knock-out!
",This can easily be one of the best pictures ever made. An amazing use of lights and shadows along with the graphic forms haven't been seen since the silent movie era. This movie is truly a work of art on how it was produced and how the actors brought these characters and scenes to life. Welles knew exactly what he was doing and is a movie mastermind. He knows how to work the business and make it so you get pulled into his art. His style is very creative and inventive. He makes the story exciting while making the graphics work beautifully along with it. When watching this movie you can tell this was a high point in movie history and I would recommend it to anyone. It may be a longer movie but it is worth every minute to watch it.,8,1,2,3 November 2014
Taxi Driver," Impressive but not amazing
","When diving into this movie you may think this is about living in the city, or about New York City itself. It reality its more than just about that, its showing how the city can tear down someones soul so quickly. Director Scorsese does a great job making you understand that concept. This movie actually surprised me. It wasn't my favorite out of all the other ones I've seen but the actual concept and process of going through the plot was well thought out. The perceptive of the main character is shown really well-showing how he's slightly lost his mind due to the war but still being down to Earth wanting to help people. The scenery shown of NYC is pretty impressive and shows you a different side of it.",7,0,0,13 December 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," Trying to live the dream
",The Grapes of Wrath is an extremely intense movie. It kept an serious tone throughout the entire movie and it honestly never got uplifting. There was no good outcome from anything that they did. There is probably one of the most mature films I have seen come from movies of the 1940's. The story is during the time of the dust bowl where no jobs are available. The actors are truly inspiring at how they display emotions on their face. The actors take this into their own hands and make it extremely believable. The director make a powerful movie at displaying the depression and how it was to be poor. If you can handle a serious movie I highly recommend this to anyone.,8,0,1,8 October 2014
Annie Hall," Woody Allen isn't my favorite actor
","I understand that Woody Allen has a huge reputation in the movie industry, but I couldn't find myself to like his work or his style. I'm not saying what he did in this movie was terrible, it was actually wonderful. The angle shots were on point, the camera panning in and out, and going from one scene to another was also pretty impressive. Even the dialogue that he shared between his co-star was witty and face paced to keep you entertained. I just couldn't get myself to like Woody Allen's character. It didn't interest me, and it didn't make me laugh. Finding it hard to like his character made it hard for me to appreciate this movie. The movie was well thought out though. The plot was interesting, the characters had their own personality, and you could feel that spark that lied between the two main characters. This just wasn't the movie for me.",6,0,1,13 December 2014
The Graduate," 'Mrs.Robinson, you're trying to seduce me.'
","This is the funniest movie I have seen in awhile. You may have your own opinion on the graduate, but I think this was honestly a knock out. Dustin Hoffman was truly the star of the show. From his quirky huffs and puffs when things started getting weird, to his reactions to different situations and being a slight odd ball I don't think this movie would be as popular without him. The relationship that his character shares with Mrs.Robinson is funny and keeps you interested because the way they react with each other is down right hilarious. Even the camera angles are perfect in this movie, such as when he gets the scuba gear on and they show his perceptive of being in it and going into the water. This movie is truly amazing, and the lighting is near to perfect. Other than the same song playing continuously and nearly driving me crazy there isn't anything that should have been changed to make this movie better.",9,2,2,13 December 2014
Singin' in the Rain," A must watch-Even if you're not a musical person!
","I didn't think that I would like singing in the rain due to the fact that I am not a musical person. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie. For being a person who doesn't normally like musicals I wasn't overwhelmed by the amount of singing that they placed throughout the movie. It was elegantly placed in the movie and was strategically placed so it flowed beautifully into the scene. Scenes with the music were also very dramatic and well thought out, such as the well known 'rain scene'. The only complaint that I would have about this movie is that the end scene tends to drag out a lot longer than it needed to. It felt like it took forever for them to get to the main point for the ending.",7,0,1,4 November 2014
Pulp Fiction," Very cool to see
","This is one of those movies where no matter how well you explain how awesome it is, they will actually just have to see the movie them self. This interesting movie is a complete mix of different time periods combined. The mood and style is so engaging in this movie, and makes you really pay attention to what is actually happening. This movie isn't afraid to bend the rules, and they show that they definitely aren't. The ways the actors work together is impressive. They add on to each of their characters giving each other more life and making themselves pop at the same time. The way the camera and lighting is set up adds on to the effects and mood of the movie, while enhancing it.",8,0,2,13 December 2014
