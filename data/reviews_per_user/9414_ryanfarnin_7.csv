Blade Runner 2049," Unreal, Could have watched it again straight away!
","Loved the pace & feel of it. Left the cinema gobsmacked by the depth of the Blade Runner world on the big screen - as I was too young to see the original in the format.Can't wait for the blu-ray, & hope to god we see more of this whole universe [we've yet to see the off-world environments]
Maybe the whole Blade Runner Arc is finished, but the potential is massive for other films!",9,1,4,15 December 2017
Aliens," Aged Terribly
","Loved this movie as a kid, & even more when the directors cut came out.But its a massive turkey.If you take out all the Military jargon you're left with about 30 minutes of script/Dialog.& the last Arc of the movie - I usually just switch it off now.Decent Sci-Fi up until Ripley goes back into the complex to save Newt.Cringe-worthy family friendly Alien movie, with very little actual Horror!",6,5,11,15 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," THE LAST TURD
","Quickest explanation for folk just scanning through the reviews is:
Wanted to walk out of the cinema after 20 minutes, but was too embarrassed - the dark theatre was hiding my shame.The main story Arc was a joke & spat in the face of EVERY space battle that came before.The side stories were no better. Poor Finn will always just be a 'nearly' character.Outside of a space ship Poe has as much appeal/presence as a Moisture Vaporator.Snoke started off well but you know how that ended.The Praetorian Guards couldn't guard a fish supper from a blind dog.Too many gags & in the wrong places - it felt like a sitcom, it was like watching the Golden Girls in space with lots of Disney filler crap CG characters.Cant get into the main villains - they've not grown as characters at all. In fact, Hux's character regressed badly after showing decent signs in the previous outing.The potential was wasted not giving Luke a bigger role. & I'm kinda fed up with this whole 'Apprentice Arc' rubbish in the SW universe.So much wrong with it that I'm not going to go into EVEN more detail. People need to be fired ASAP. Starting with the director - from making any more SW movies.So ashamed!!",1,19,28,15 December 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," The Godfather of thriller Sci-fi movies
",There's not much to add to the endless comments of this classic but I'll try.1st viewing I was really confused/bored.But after multiple viewings I realised this is basically the early template.It mixes in fears about AI & impossible unanswered questions about existence/the afterlife.It throws up questions rather than answers like most movie viewers want nowadays - they want everything explained so they don't need to think.,9,1,2,16 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Worthy
",They started again with new characters while blending in the originals. But it felt too fast paced at times.Watched it 4 or 5 times now. It's better than most of the prequel SW films but like I thought originally - it was a lazy/Disney effort.Despite my grumbles I'm giving it a 7 out of 10 - mostly because there was more right with it than wrong.,7,1,4,15 December 2017
Life," Another Space Infection
",Although well made it felt like another rehash of the dozens of similar Sci-Fi's already in circulation.,5,1,3,18 December 2017
Alien: Covenant," David Movie
","This isn't an Alien movie, but more a 'David' movie.Fair play to Ridley in creating arguably an even more evil baddie than the Alien.
The Alien is naturally a killer by instinct. But the android David is an under-the-radar serial killer.Fassbender - brilliant acting!Too many characters in this film I didn't care for including the main human protagonist. Their deaths we're..'Meh'Left the theatre feeling a we bit cheated tbh, but got the Blu-ray & the extra's provided a glimpse into how insane David really is. :')Gutted their was no human-engineer interactions.Enjoyed it better the 2nd & 3rd times, but Mr Scott needs to lay off the bloody Robots & concentrate on the Alien/Engineers more!",7,0,1,15 December 2017
