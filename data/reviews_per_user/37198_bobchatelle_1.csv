Child 44," Disappointing -- Read the Book Instead
","I was quite disappointed because I had read the book, which I recommend instead. The book has some stunning surprises and plot twists -- all of which were eliminated for this movie. As a result, much doesn't make sense.Important characters -- including the killer -- are undeveloped.The movie does a fair job of capturing the feeling of oppression, although the paranoia in the book is more intense.",4,7,10,12 March 2017
