Catch Me If You Can," Decent fluff
","This is one the FEW films in which DiCaprio was decently casted. I did not believe him as a street thief in Gangs of New York for a second, but he pulls the con as Frank Abagnale rather well, considering the fact all he had to do for a third of the movie is smile and look pretty. Christopher Walken - God I love him - looked like he was reading cue cards for part of this film, but he played the frailty of Frank's dad damn well. Tom Hanks was probably the better of the three, as the FBI agent chasing Frank but his role seemed almost for comic relief. The scene stealer here I thought, was John Williams' pseudojazz score. The music reminded me of those 60s cop shows, but with a quick tempo to remind us that this is, after all, a chase movie. With bright washed out lights, the cinematography lent a dream like quality to the atmosphere, but in reality served to tell us that this is just Hollywood fluff.",7,0,1,4 January 2003
Gangs of New York," Could have been WAY better
","*Possible Spoilers* This film had so much promise to it, but some questionable casting and a needless ending put a stop to that. The story here is Daniel Day Lewis as Bill the Butcher, stealing every scene he is in. He walks the walk, he talks the talk. He makes everyone around him pale in comparison, especially Leonardo DiCaprio. For this reason, I did not believe he was a street thief for a minute, nor would he have been able to walk alongside The Butcher. You can tell from his first fight scene with Bill's henchman that he had no inkling how to put up his fists. Scorsese's usual magical camera seemed to be missing in action, for he decided to let the script tell the story. The screenplay was passable, but it makes me wonder why every script writer in Hollywood has to throw a romantic interest in everything they write. And don't get me started on that horrible CGI ending. There was no need to explain the impact of those times on modern New York. I wished it would have focused more on the political corruption of the time and the religious conflicts between the Catholics and Protestants. I think I am going to see Bloody Sunday for that.",8,0,0,4 January 2003
