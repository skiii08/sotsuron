United 93," Much Better When It's Limited to the Plane
","I said it in my review of 'Brick', something is going to have to blow me further away to make me think of it as a better movie this year. And 'United 93' isn't that.In fact, I was rather disappointed.The scenes on-board the actual plane are amazing and tense and define a lot of...stuff. You know, that Americans can unite for a short period of time. That, though we may all be different, we all love and care for other people.Then everything else is pretty much 'Armageddon'. We're in the scenes where everyone is in the control room, babbling incoherently. I was bored. Everything made this to be a story about United Airlines flight 93, not everything else that was going on on September 11th. In fact, that's what I was really hoping for. But no. We're in that stupid control room and it's taking away from the film. Not to mention, it all felt like a prolonged scene from 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. 'Do you want to report a UFO? Repeat: do you want to report a UFO?' As an audience, we know exactly what happened that day from an outsiders' point-of-view. I frankly wasn't interested in seeing what the military was doing.I do like Paul Greengrass's work, but I think he shakes the cameraman by the shoulders when he's filming something. There are times when the shaky camera does work. Like the hijacking and the uprising. I would be willing to bet that those times were just a big mess of confusion, and I think the film delivers that greatly. But everything else is super-hand-held. It gets annoying. I've seen other, better, hand-held movies. Just look at 'Saving Private Ryan' for one. When the characters are steady, the shots are nearly steady. The same goes for 'The Constant Gardener' and any Robert Rodriguez flick pre-'Spy Kids'. They know how to control it and it works better.The camera-work is more overused here than it is during 'The Bourne Supremacy'. 'Supremecy' was all about confusion and spy-tactics and everything, so it was effective. People know what's going on in this movie (after a certain point and strictly limited to those stupid control room scenes) but they don't know what to do about it.Again, the United 93 scenes work so much, because Greengrass lets us get into the characters (or as much as they could base off the characters). The phoning home scenes are touching and show that people do care about others besides themselves. There were no messages of hatred or anything, even though what these terrorists were doing was pretty horrible. Those final moments (before the uprising) were about making peace, and that is demonstrated greatly. We saw it in 'Munich' as the main characters suffer and we in turn are more connected to the action on screen. This is what happens during the plane sequences.Personally, I think Greengrass should have abandoned the whole 'real-time' aspect. This makes all the control room scenes seem like a dull episode of '24' while the cameraman has a seizure. He could have easily made a tight film cutting all that out, and emotionally I believe it would have impacted everyone even more.'United 93', while it is a good film, it could have been delivered in such a better way. I repeat (because I'm a post-Modernists and we do like repetition), the airplane scenes are gripping and heartfelt and the best parts of the movie. Pity it wasn't limited to just that.B",7,2,9,29 April 2006
Memento," A BORING WASTE OF MY TIME
","I don't know...for some reason I just didn't like this movie. A bunch of my friends had said thati it was really good and messed with your head and everything and came out at a time when I really respected M. Night Shayamalan (he said this was probably one of his favorite films). So I got the DVD and I watched it and was just bored to death. Sure, the acting was okay and the story was good, but the direction just went nowhere and the minutes seemed to drag on.And then there was one thing that really brought it down for me. The 'I don't remember anything before the night my wife died.' If he doesn't remember anything before his wife died, how does he remember that he has a condition. Something that Quentin Tarantino pointed out.This movie just never ticked me with. I found it too slow and too drawn out, like Christopher Nolan was wanting you the get it instead of messing with your head (like the repetitive scenes where Lenny meets the girl and Teddy keeps saying hello). But that's just my opinion and I think you should just judge this movie for yourself like you should judge anything.",3,3,6,13 April 2004
The Polar Express," See It In 3-D, if You Can
","I'm lucky enough to live in Colorado Springs, which has one of the few 3-D IMAX Theaters. Be that as it may, I hardly ever attend a film there because it's like $3 more than the regular matin√©e ticket price ($5.25). But I went with my family to see this yesterday and I'm glad this is where I saw The Polar Express.The Polar Express isn't necessarily a good movie. It shows how difficult it is to adapt something like a 32-paged picture book into a 100 minute movie. There are some pointless adventures on top of the train, with a ticket, and on some ice. Then within the workshops of the elves (I wish that more people would make elves tall, like the ones Tolkien brought to life in his novels). On top of that, there is a rather annoying musical number with, get this, Tom Hanks singing. And then, at the end, the film falls victim to its own sentimentality. It gets to be TOO sentimental, unlike the book, where the whole mood fit right in. And because of this, I don't think this would have been that great of a movie in 2-D on the regular screens. But in 3-D, Zemeckis's visuals pop out at you. You can catch try to catch the snow, stop the train, slap the Hero Boy in the face, or shake Tom Hanks's hand (my brother tried to do all of these). This is what made the movie cool to me. So, if you ever get the chance, see it in 3-D at an IMAX theater. But be warned, the lines will be HUGE. At the ticket booth, nearly all the IMAX shows were sold out while there seemed to be a lot of room in the normal theaters. Get there early and bring a book to read. In fact, if you're taking little kids like your children or siblings, why don't you take the BOOK itself and read it to them before going to the movie? Again, I'm glad my city has one of these theaters. Oh, one more thing. At least at our IMAX we didn't get those annoying blue and red glasses that came with Spy Kids 3-D. You get those nice black ones, so you can see all the colors the same, but the images still stick out at you. You know, the kind they have at DisneyWorld.For this film, I would give it 2/4 if I had seen it in normal theaters. But since I got THE IMAX EXPERIENCE, I'll give it 3/4.",7,2,4,12 November 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," Hands Down, Best Movie of 2006
","It's hard to find a really good road movie. Most tend to have really great moments but are followed by long, drawn out sections that are kinda boring and making us as the viewer wish they'd go to funnier things. 'Transamerica' is a great movie, but it did drag on the road at times. Same with 'Vacation' and boatloads of other movies in that vein. Of course, then there are the absolutely down-right horrible road movies, like oh, I don't know...'Road Trip' and pretty much all the Vacations that followed the original.So we come to 'Little Miss Sunshine'. The film opens with a young girl (Abagail Breslin of 'Signs' fame--she's way better in this), who is about 7 or 8, staring directly at us. We know she's watching TV because a beauty pageant is reflected in her glasses that are about twice the size of John Lennon's.What follows is a brief introduction of all the characters of the Hoover family. There's the son, Dwyane (Paul Dano from L. I. E.), who has been reading Nietchze and has decided that the only thing for him to do is to take a vow of silence until he can get into the Air Force Academy; he spends most of his time working out and reading 'Thus Spake Zarathustra.' Next comes the Grandpa (Alan Arkin) who just got kicked out of his retirement home for chasing the women and snorting heroin. The dad (Greg Kinnear) is attempting to become a self-help guru; he's bent on winning and sees losers as seem to be dragged along the sidewalk, yet his 9-step program isn't doing that fabulously. The Mom (Toni Collete, always great) really wants the family to stay together but there's just not enough time for everything. And then there's her brother, Frank (Steve Carell), who has just tried to commit suicide because his boyfriend left him for the world's second-most Proust scholar who is climbing up the ranks.That's the family. Like The Simpsons, there's a little bit of everyone you can see in The Hoovers.Everyone is cast so perfectly. It's one of those instances where you forget all these big names and refer to them as Olive, Frank, Dwayne, Grandpa, Sheryl, and Richard. When a cast can do that you know they're doing a great job.The movie's trailers may make it seem more like a comedy-drama but the drama angle is actually downplayed. 'LIttle Miss Sunshine' is a genuinely hilarious film. That's all I can say because the road is paved with comedy that's even the more hilarious as you come upon it.Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Ferris take the Spike Jonze route in their transition to the big screen rather than the, say, McG approach. This directing couple are visionaries, that's for sure. One doesn't need to look further than the two best Chili Peppers videos, 'Otherside' and 'Californication', to see that. They keep the weird visions subdued for the most part, but they are able to keep the incredibly boring road from Albequerque to Los Angelos interesting. That's quite a feat, I have to say, because New Mexico is really boring.The music also stands out, especially since the songs are performed by DeVotchKa, probably the most original band out there that I've heard of (and they're from Colorado, take that The Fray!). They have this beautiful and strange sound that matches the entire film. Also contributing to the soundtrack are some great cuts by Sufjan Stevens, one of those big indie guys. DeVotchKa's better but still.Really, this is a farce movie. There are loads of hysterical events that had my entire theater bursting guts. I don't envy the cleaning people after this showing. The Volkswagon Bus, being held together by it's last remaining nerves and muscles makes a great metaphor for the entire family but at the same time is a great gag throughout that never grows thin through all its foibles (though of course, if I were driving that thing I'd get pretty annoyed with it pretty quickly).'Little Miss Sunshine' was picked up at Sundance for nearly 10 million dollars, the biggest in Sundance history. It was well worth it. It's an audience-pleaser and a great piece of art. There's a great satire underneath the entire thing too. It's most visible towards the end of the film during the beauty pageant, which is both uncomfortable and, how many times have I said funny? Can't really deny the truth. This should be the 'Brokeback' of 2006 mainly because it's about four times better than that. It's 'Vacation' with a heart.The audience I saw it with when I sojourned to Denver applauded at the end. Everyone just seemed so happy while walking out the theater.A+.",10,1,3,5 November 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Excellent Film, Very Well Done by Cuaron (Maybe Some Spoilers)
","I love the Harry Potter books a lot, they're really fun to read and have some good suspenseful moments (except for the end of Book Five, which only really evoked anger. Thank God for Fred and George) and great images that you can think of in your mind. Are the books the best thing ever written? No. Not even close, but they're still great. And my favorite one so far (waiting in anticipation for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and whatever Book Seven will be) is Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban. Don't get me wrong, the first two were great, but Book Three took the cake.I really like the books, but am not the biggest fan of the franchise.I was disappointed in the first two films. Film One wasn't very good at all, too much CGI and the kids weren't really working their characters Film Two was much better, but again, the kids weren't the characters and there was way too much CGI camera effects. So what did I expect about Film Three? First, I was stoked to see that Chris Colombus wasn't going to direct these films, and when I found out that Alfonso Cuaron (from Y Tu Mama Tambien and A Little Princess fame) was helming this project I was psyched out of my mind and I probably anticipated this film more than any other this summer (and third for the entire year, after The Incredibles and Kill Bill Volume 2).Was I let down?No. First of all, Cuaron says a nice 'Screw You' to Colombus's vision of a happy castle where everyone gets along and little furry woodland creatures come up and sing songs. Hogwarts is now dark and mysterious, now maliciously lurking in the shadows. More like the Hogwarts I pictured while reading the books. And then there's this cool bridge thingy that stretches out, which is one of my favorite editions, along with the clocktower. If not for anything else, check out this film for its amazing cinematography and superb direction by Cuaron.The actors finally come into their characters. And Emma Watson becomes a total hottie. I think what helped a lot is the focus more on entering puberty and growing up rather than playing with magic. On a sidenote, Cuaron had the kids write an essay about their characters. Daniel Radcliff turned in one about 3 pages long, Emma Watson turned one in 16 pages long, and Rupert Grint didn't even do it. But the kids are now the characters and you're totally engrossed by the story.Which is: Harry Potter is going back to Hogwarts, but is being pursued by this escaped convict from the wizard version of Alcatraz, Azkaban. Everyone is scared pantsless and dementors (basically Ringwraiths that can fly and suck out your soul, but are still cool nonetheless) patrol the school grounds. We find out that the convict is Sirius Black, a friend of the Potters who betrayed them and wants to kill Harry because he wants Voldemort to go back to power (or does he?). Harry gets pissed and wants to kill him for doing what he did. I did have a few problems with the film, that kept it from being perfect. I thought the confrontation with Sirius Black was a little TOO rushed. And the werewolf really didn't do anything for me.But those problems are cancelled out by the best time-travel scene so far and the wonderful acting and cinematography. Not to mention the CGI effects are mainly thrown in the background, since Cuaron wisely wants to focus more on the characters, something that I think Colombus would have never done. That's not to say there aren't any. But they look good and fit with everything else in the film. Like Buckbeak, who is very well done, and then the return of the Whomping Willow, now more as a character rather than a prop. Still, this film also has my favorite CGI camera work, when we go through this clocktower...So awesome. I saw this with a friend and he had more problems than I did and complained about them before saying he overall liked the movie. I really only had those two problems so I really, really enjoyed it. With the fans of the books this is either their favorite (as in my case) or their least favorite, and from what I've seen on message boards and stuff, it seems to be the same for the films. I say check it out, because it's really worth it. I give it 3.5/4.",10,0,1,29 November 2004
The Incredibles," Just So Awesome!
","This has got to be one of my favorite animated films, ever. Ranking up there with The Triplets of Belleville. Everything in this film just works so well, falling together perfectly. Each voice casting, the visuals, and the story. Brad Bird has to be one of my favorite animation directors (creating the excellent Iron Giant, and directing one of my personal favorite episodes of The Simpsons, 'Krusty Gets Busted')and he masterfully displays his skill here.This blows Finding Nemo away (which, I feel, was overrated) as well as anything else that Pixar released. And it deals with issues you'd never think you'd see in a Disney movie. Like infidelity and fights that occur within families. And then so many of the heroes die, though this is usually told in a flashback way and is really funny. The story is excellent and the action sequences are intense. The forrest chase between the two kids and those razor bladed hover-things was great, reminding me of the speeder chase in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, except done MUCH BETTER. The final fight was just as intense. This time, with Samuel L. Jackson's Frozone coming in to kick some robo butt as well. Oh, and note how Samuel L. Jackson plays a character that freezes things, further defining how cool he actually is.Basically, this movie is just so awesome. Better than a lot of things I've seen this year. Shrek 2 and Shark Tale, two other big computer animated releases, are left in this film's dust. In means of story and visuals. Visually, sometimes landscape scenes look so REAL, that you wonder if George Lucas is going to use them for the upcoming Star Wars film. And the characters interact in a real way too, that it seems the animators at Pixar had to hold themselves down so people remember that this is still an animated movie.Kudos to you Brad Bird. For 115 minutes, you kept us gripped!",10,0,1,8 November 2004
War of the Worlds," Spielberg Shows Us Aliens Aren't Just Cuddly and Trying to Phone Home
","May contain spoilers.I'm probably one of the last people you want to go to when asking about a Steven Spielberg film, because I'll always tell you they are always good. Or great. Or awesome. Or spectacular. I think there might be one other director who I'll make myself like their films. One.I mean, Jurassic Park made me choose two career paths: 1. a paleontologist, and 2. a filmmaker. So you can blame that movie for everything. But seriously, Spielberg has changed my life with most of his films, and even his weaker ones I'll make myself like if I have to.Whenever I walk into a Spielberg theater I think, 'Okay, I'm just going to immerse myself in this world you're presenting and even if the largest plot-hole ever exists, I'll believe it.' And it hasn't failed. I've never had to make myself like a Spielberg movie, either. I always have. He obviously is very much in control of his material. Self-proclaiming directors like Lars von Trier don't have anything on him.Tarantino should quiver in his presence. The only other filmmaker almost on par with Spielberg in Scorsese. Seriously, Spielberg was named the greatest filmmaker by a British magazine. Hitchcock and Kubrick are excellent as well, but. . . . I don't know, basically I have a bias towards Spielbergian films. I always will. I have had one since 1993 and it hasn't gone away, even when I've gone through my different phases and whatnot.So, on to War of the Worlds.I loved it. And it is, by far, the best film of 2005. Batman Begins, Star Wars, Cinderella Man, and all those other films have nothing on this.First of all, Spielberg gives us believable characters. He is going to make you like these guys, because, if you don't, you won't care what happens to them. And that's what tension is all about. Second, he gives us a story. Actually, it's H. G. Wells's classic masterpiece story, though vamped up a bit. The ending and events are all relatively the same, but just in a different time period. Finally, when characters and story are out of the way, Spielberg knocks us out with the visuals.It's a running movie. Tom Cruise and his kids run away from the alien creatures. And just like Spielberg made it seem like they could be our friends, he turns around and shows us how they can rape us as well.The tension. Man, some of those scenes are incredibly intense, I can't even describe (though one of them mimics Jurassic Park, but that's all good). I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, I was engulfed in what was going on.Then, I squirmed in a few places. Like the red mist scene.Brilliant film.And we get performances out of everyone that is actually worthwhile. Cruise proves he can act and isn't always just a pretty face (think the Mission: Impossible films). I'm not a big fan of Dakota Fanning, but she was excellent.Again, the story gives us plenty of moments of intensity. And great, and loud visuals. Kaminski's cinematography always makes you think that the entire thing is surreal, but very real, like the worst adrenaline rush ever.The ending was kind of a bit off, but it can be forgiven by the brilliant scenarios that proceed it.Anyways, I still think this is the best movie of 2005 by far. See it now.***1/2 /****",9,1,4,3 July 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," Doesn't Top the First, But Still Cool
","The Bourne Identity is probably my favorite spy movie. Bourne has to use his brains to figure everything out and quickly dispatches his nemesis before moving on. Oh, and here's the best part...THE COPS ACTUALLY SHOWED UP ALMOST Immediately AFTER SOMETHING HAPPENED! That was so shocking and amazing! The police actually doing their jobs! And that film created a real sense of realism (well, except for the end when Bourne jumped down that building, popped a guy in the head, and used that dead body to break his fall, but that was still pretty cool). Doug Liman created something different from all the other spy thrillers and it remains my favorite.So now, here we have The Bourne Supremacy. A lot of it is a retread of the first one. More things for Bourne to figure out, avoiding the CIA who so desperately wants to kill him, and then just beating up people who try to kill him. Is this bad? No. It's very cool. Like the first one, this movie is a chase thriller, but I don't think it was handled as well as the first.You know have Brian Cox's character taking over the Chris Cooper character, but now he's using this other team to hunt down Bourne. And then there are some other assassins trying to kill him. And you know how it is.Much like the first one, this one really strayed away from the book, which I feel is a good thing because now the movie and the book can be judged on their own. The major element lifted from the book still in the movie is that some assassins killed some people and they put the blame on Bourne.I don't think Paul Greengrass is as good as Doug Liman because I don't think he has the same passion as Liman for Bourne. Listen to commentary on the DVD and you'll see. He uses hand-held cameras, like what Liman did with the first one, but still there is a lack of the energy Liman tried to get with the first film. But the chases are cool, the fighting is awesome, and it still has intelligence.The two car chases don't hold up to the one in the first film and there is still no scene that comes close to the one in The Bourne Identity where he chases Clive Owen at the Farmhouse. Still, this movie is really cool.",Null,0,1,23 July 2004
