Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Surprisingly boring
","I had relatively low expectations for this film--although I thought that by keeping my expectations low, by the time the marvellous soundtrack started to roll, I would be whisked out of my cynicism and into at least a reasonably enjoyable movie experience, somewhat akin to seeing a decent Bond film.  However, rather than casting aside my doubts, I ended up being bored in long stretches, as the bloated, uninteresting plot plodded along.Only 2 characters approached being developed, and they had to share time with not nearly as good as I expected special effects, pointless comic episodes, and plot misturns. Ultimately, this film succeeds only at maintaining the 'Star Wars' feel, and adds nothing positive to the legacy of the original.The few scenes which were interesting were a nice race scene, which maintained suspense throughout and a well staged fight betweeen the largely wordless and completely undeveloped Death Mall (or whatever his name was) and the two Jedis.As for the rest of it, Puh-leez!  Lucas had, what, 10+ years to write this? How did Darth Vader become the boy genius, troubled Savior (a virgin birth is implied for little Ani) we see here?  He's so outstanding that he argues to his mom that it is their moral obligation to help the Jedis, and never does anything selfish.  The Jedi stuff was always simpleton philosophy, but Lucas gives us enough additional information here to realize it is spirituality for the stupid and lazy only.Kudos are due to Liam Nelson for his great presence, and Natalie Portman's fine, minimalist job portraying the Queen.",1,3,6,26 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The worst movie ever made
","While there may be movies that have worse acting,  technicalaccomplishment, or stories, none of those films have cost asmuch or desecrated a cherished childhood memory the way'Phantom Menace' does. While Lucas has committed many crimes with this film (replacing character and story with CGI, forone; vaguely veiled derogatory racial stereotypes for another), thecardinal sin of this film is that is unbearably boring. I suspect'Cannonball Run' on a worn-out VHS tape would be more involving.",1,1,3,21 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Beautiful, fascinating, but interminable
","There's a lot to like here, but ultimately this film should have beenan hour shorter. The plot is incredibly repetative: the heroes facehorrible danger, fight their way out, and then barely escape--repeat, repeat, repeat. There is almost no characterdevelopment, or for that matter, development of anything other thanthrills. But thrill after thrill eventually gets boring, and two hours in, Icouldn't wait for it to be over.All is not a loss, however, as the magical environment and specialeffects are dazzling and almost succeed at keeping the film going.",8,0,0,6 January 2002
300," Boring
","While the colorists did an amazing job, the lack of story and over-reliance on slow-motion made this movie one of the most boring I've seen in a long time. Essentially, this movie is a long battle, intercut with pointless back story that is so facile that it provides absolutely no depth to the one-dimensional characters. While the battle initially has some mild entertainment value (although it's a pale imitation of violence in the Matrix), it quickly becomes fatiguing. Unless you enjoy exaggerated blood splatter sounds and seeing limbs cut off for the sake of limbs getting cut off, there isn't much to engage the audience.The director seems to think audiences don't appreciate the difficulty of fighting human foes, so it pits the Spartans against numerous monsters and hyper large beasts. Yet, with no context and an unending stream of slow-motion violence, the monsters and gigantic beasts don't provide any thrills: they're not scary or menacing. They come, they get killed, they are forgotten.The movie has other problems, but I fear mentioning them will have readers discount how boring the action is.",2,3,8,7 August 2008
