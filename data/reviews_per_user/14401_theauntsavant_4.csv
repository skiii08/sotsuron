The King's Speech," King's Speech Sweeps Best Picture and Lead Actor Academy Wins
","The well-chosen words used by reigning Queen Elizabeth (daughter of King George VI) to describe the film that won the Best Picture Oscar as 'touching' and 'entertaining,' echo the critical praise it received. In addition, the authentic big screen re-creation based on factual incidents in the life of the future King—is insightful, humorous and inspiring. Colin Firth, the Academy Award winner for Best Actor, portrays the King with earnest sensitivity; and the filmmakers masterfully succeed at extracting a succinct chunk of history that could be perceived as inconsequential and making it commercially viable. Although it covers an inclusive timeline of publicly recorded events, which occurred within the five-year period prior to America's entry from 1934 - 1939; the back-story doesn't bog down the principle tale centered on the King's severe stammer with historic setup. It begins with the current queen's late mother's quest to seek professional help for her husband's speech impediment. Best Supporting Actress winner Helena Bonham Carter, lovingly portrays the much beloved 'Queen Mum,' as a devoted and supportive wife to King George V, who finds unorthodox and uncredentialed speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). The candid depiction of George's personal struggle to overcome his self-consciously crippling stutter with the aid of Logue before and after he becomes King, is a profoundly empowering account of courage and self-determination that bears telling—with meticulous direction—which-bares viewing.Much of its mass appeal is due to the sympathetic, humanizing representation of the King as a traditional monarch ultimately extricating himself from the segregative barriers of royal protocol, and revealing how the common vocal disorder immensely impacts his life. Shedding light on the debilitating disorder may, hopefully alter the perception of the dysfunction, frequently a source of ridicule aimed at those who suffer with the verbal handicap.Prior to his first national radio address broadcast live at the onset of World War II, guided by Logue, he had been literally thrust into the position of 'accidental' king. The death of his father King George V, was followed closely by the abdication of the throne by the next son in succession to become king in order to marry the soon-to-be twice divorced Wallis Simpson. Through Logue'unconventional methods, he eventually relinquishes his initial resistance and skepticism—to find his voice. As the King eloquently remarks, when he speaks, the nation believes he speaks for them. It was no surprise that the two men forged a working relationship and lifelong bond.",Null,0,1,6 November 2011
Titanic," Titanic Even More Impactful as 3D Re-release on Centennial
","The 3D re-release of James Cameron's 1997 big screen epic based on the R.M.S Titanic's 1912 sinking, starring a young Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet—to-date, has received the most acclaim of any of the other nearly 30 film, documentary and made-for-television productions. His initial 2D version of the modern classic Titanic saga snagged a record 11 of its 14 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director for Cameron, whose cinematic achievement ignited renewed interest in the most infamous maritime disaster in history for another generation of ardent viewers. The very fact that the strategic timing of the digitally enhanced movie coincided with the 15th anniversary of the original picture and the 100th year commemoration of the incident that occurred at approximately 2:20 am on April 15, 1912, set the stage for local and international observances. Reports cited 25 million people visited centennial exhibits worldwide. Although the exact numbers are slightly skewed, over 1500 of the more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board were tragically lost at sea after the luxury ocean liner struck an iceberg in the icy waters of the North Atlantic. Billed at the time as 'unsinkable,' the ship, built at a cost of $7,500, 000 was bound for New York harbor when it sank on its maiden voyage from England, four days into the estimated 137-hour trip. The sinking garnered huge headlines around the world largely due to widely publicized advance launch announcements by the White Star Line.Numerous depictions of the colossal tragedy quickly followed with two produced the same year. The first completed just 29 days later: Saved from the Titanic, was written by a survivor who also starred in the silent film destroyed in a studio fire. Similar titled features included a 1943 Titanic that emphasized the president of White Star urging the ship's captain 'to make the fastest possible crossing to NY,' a second in 1953 and A Night to Remember in 1958, which depicted the facts from the standpoint of the most senior officer to survive the ill-fated shipwreck. The addition of special effects to the heart-tugging, romantic blockbuster delivered even more impact to put you right there amid the action and drama. While it may not have been as effective in early scenes, it improved the quality of the sequences leading up to the fateful night. Given the new discoveries, as well as discrepancies uncovered in 'Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron' during the 30 plus dives he's made to the wreckage since serving as screenwriter, producer and editor of Titanic, this upgrade didn't lengthen the minute runtime—much.",7,1,1,12 September 2012
The Blind Side," The Blind Side Demonstrates Black History at its Best
","You'll be blindsided if you're not at least able to discern basic football positions cited in its intro and used throughout The Blind Side. Narrated by Sandra Bullock in the voice of character Leigh Anne Tuohy, a professional upscale Caucasian wife and mother who opens her house—and heart to a then homeless African American teen referred to as 'Big Mike.' Bullock explains that the job of the left tackle ' is to protect the quarterback's blind side.' Although Michael Oher is the focal figure of the heartwarming movie based on true events in his life documented in 'The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game,' each Tuohy family member has a key role, which figures prominently in helping Oher to overcome the challenges of his impoverished childhood. At the time Oher's unaware of the whereabouts of his drug-abusing mother, who is displaced from their Project apartment. Accused of having ulterior motives for taking in the genteel and peaceful-natured, promising athlete; the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) investigates the Tuohys on suspicion of being 'boosters' for their alma mater: University of Mississippi (Ole Miss), and imposing undue influence over Oher to play for the school's team. Passed through the educational system with a near zero IQ, below average reading level and no personal records; Oher succeeds despite the odds against him to make the Dean's List, and become a 2009 NFL first-round draft pick offensive tackle for the Baltimore Ravens. (Oher's high school assessment test reveals a 98% rating for protective instinct, a pivotal point that factors in the overall film and positive outcome). Youngest child and only son—before legal guardianship of Oher is obtained—adorable pint-sized, freckle-faced charmer Jae Head as SJ (replete with braces), steals the spotlight the moment he appears on screen and holds it to the very end. Bullock's Oscar-winning portrayal of Leigh Anne's strong,domineering character is evident as she literally bounds into the scene. Not as aggressively but with more subtlety, country crooner Tim McGraw is surprisingly equally endearing as her mild mannered, docile husband Sean, who customarily gives in to his wife's overly willful personality. The personal photos of Oher, the Tuohys and a video clip of the televised first round draft ceremony shown alongside the ending credits roll, appropriately demonstrate recent black history at its best.",Null,0,1,25 June 2012
Draft Day," Draft Day, a Good Movie Pick
","With the NFL Draft season officially in full swing, if you haven't already, now's a great time to see 'Draft Day' the movie! Even if it does stand to reason, foretelling whether or not it would be received more positively by non-football enthusiasts and resonate less with true football fans (as some critics have deduced), is nonetheless a rush to judgment.In any case, the box office draw doesn't differentiate one over the other. The entertaining sports vehicle about the NFL draft not actual gridiron game play goes against formula.We've seen football films that keep to standard rough and tumble field action, which fit the bill. However, the focus here in itself, is a good departure as a movie on the managerial side of the sport of interest for either group.Being a non-fanatical Monday morning quarterback, I enjoyed watching a view from behind-the-scenes for a change of pace, and getting a crash course in the extraneous details of what occurs in a crucial 24-hour period-similar to TV series '24'-leading up to the draft day ceremony.As for the question of is it realism or Hollywood hype? Co-star and former professional football player now actor Terry Crews, who said he was an 11-round draft pick in 1991, in a pre-release call-in interview to the Steve Harvey Morning Show, stated that 'Draft Day' was the first movie endorsed by the NFL.So would the League sign-off on a film that represents a 'day-in-the-life of' a general manager played by sports cinema veteran Kevin Costner, managing the real-life Cleveland Browns, if it didn't measure up? Most likely not.Sure, football fans will probably have a better understanding than will others of the evolving events being dramatized on the big screen, but I believe that's meant to give the rest of the audience a microcosmic picture of the high-pressured inner-workings and how it all comes together.It presents an intimate look at the level of intensity that comes when the selection process rises to fever pitch (forgive the baseball reference) and how the lives of the hopefuls looking to get picked, as well as their families, hinges on the manager's final decision.The film works well at drawing you into the thought-provoking/judgment-making job of Costner's character Sonny Weaver, while also keeping you glued to the countdown timer. The spliced boiler room frames meld cohesively to sustain moviegoers' heightened curiosity for the anticipated outcome.Jennifer Garner is low-key as Costner's girlfriend, though a far cry from her starring lead role in TV's 'Alias.' Hers, along with Ellen Burstyn's portrayal, brings necessary added value to balance out the storyline.As the father of a potential student draftee, Crews delivers a meaningful, non-comedic performance. The elements put in play, overall, make for a finely crafted sports entertainment feature everyone can enjoy.",8,20,29,19 April 2014
