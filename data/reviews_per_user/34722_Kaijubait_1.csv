The Ring," Crass American remake
","Please people, give me break. None of you have obviously seen the original Japanese version of this film, Ringu, which leaves this remake so far in the dust that it isn't even funny... or should I say 'scary'. Unfortunately, seeing this version just might ruin the initial suspense of seeing the far superior film. Sad sad sad... No more Hollywood remakes of quality asian cinema, please.",Null,1,2,25 September 2002
