The Blair Witch Project," Requires Some Contemplation and Maybe Another Go
","I was one of the thousands sucked into the hype about this film.  I read everything I could get my hands on about it, and made sure to check the official website every Friday for updates.  I think the problem with this was that I knew more about the movie than actually was in it.  On July 16th when it opened up in Cambridge, I was practically camped out outside.  As I sat and watched, I found myself checking my watch and looking around the darkened theatre during what seemed like too many uninteresting moments.  I left a little- no a lot- disappointed.  But after the conversations it started with my friends and the nightmare it gave me that night, I decided I'd have to go one more time and make sure I went with a more opened mind.  EUREKA!  It worked, and I love this film!  I guess you would say it took some getting used to.  I only wonder why everyone's giving it rave reviews and not a single one of those cynical critics has given it a bad review (hmmmm...).",3,1,4,19 July 1999
There's Something About Mary," TRASH!
","This was AWFUL!!!  Everyone says, 'It's SO funny, you have to see it!'  I was incredibly upset by this film...  I'm not much for being PC, but the 'issues' surrounding Mary's brother made me sick!  I was skeptical at first, and I'm glad I didn't pay to rent this.  Ben Stiller should start his show up again.  Any redeeming qualities, you might ask?  I'm a Jonathan Richman fan.  He was the best part and my reason for agreeing to watch at all.",1,0,2,1 March 1999
Life Is Beautiful," Some of Us Are Missing the Point....
","I loved this film!  It made me laugh, the ending shocked me a bit, and it made me think.  I gave it a TEN.Some of the other users that have left negative comments seem to be missing the point.  Roberto Benigni loves Charlie Chaplin, and knows everything about him.  You'd be a fool to go into this movie thinking that you're not going to see things like eggs dropping on heads, people crashing into each other, clothing being ripped, Guido falling over a chair, etc.  It's a little sappy, a touch of cheesy, but that's the way he wants it.As for the comments like, 'How could a smart young boy believe this game?': it's a movie.  A story.  You all suspend your disbelief and watch the BS that happens in action and horror movies, so, why not give a sweet story like this a chance?You're right to say that children and other folks should read in books about the actual horrors of the Holocaust.  This movie is not supposed to be an 'educational film'.  Your kids go to school for that.  You go into it knowing that it's a 'tragicomedy'.  If you send your kids to a movie nowadays in order to really teach them something, you've got problems.Overall, I'm sorry that so many have become movie cynics.  There aren't many fresh movies out there anymore- too many remakes and movie versions of TV shows.  'La Vita e Bella' is a true original and deserves our (the U.S.) attention!",9,1,2,6 March 1999
Signs," Why Should I Care?
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I had been looking forward to seeing this movie- in my opinion, nothing has warranted much hype this year since 'Spider-man'.  I attended a screening already disappointed by one fact I had been warned about (if your interested, I'll put it at the end with a spoiler warning), but still slightly optimistic.I left 'Signs' feeling very glad that I hadn't paid the $10 for it.  I have never cared before, but found myself very concerned that the character development was horrible!  Why did I care about these people?  Just because they lost their matriarch in a horrible (and completely non-logical) way? That just couldn't cut it for me...  I was glad to see Mel Gibson playing a role where he acts his age rather than trying to act forever the 'hunk', but the rest of the characters were totally shallow.***POTENTIAL SPOILERS***My original disappointment before I even came to the theater?  I knew that aliens would be seen.  I'm a firm believer in leaving scary things up to the imagination, and hence yielding more scared movie-goers.  On the other hand, the first time you see an alien (via a children's birthday party home video on the news), it seems believable.  The 'home video' quality seems accurate, and the fear in the people filming seems genuine.But after the film you leave with few answers to many questions...  How does Shyamalan's character figure out the water thing so easily?  Why so much build-up with Bo's water obsession?  What the heck did that alien do to Morgan?  Perhaps the least believable: 'Father, we decided since your wife is pretty much severed in half by a truck that we'd just leave her there until you got here, so you can watch her die!'  Actually, I lie...  The most unbelievable part is that a former reverend who no longer believes in his God after watching his wife die, would suddenly believe again after surviving an alien invasion!***END SPOILERS***BOTTOM LINE: If you can see this for free, do it.  If you're easily scared by sudden noises during a pause or the idea of aliens, then you'll probably enjoy this a lot more than I did.",4,1,1,24 July 2002
