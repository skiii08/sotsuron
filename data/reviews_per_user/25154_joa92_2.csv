War Dogs," its pretty good, not perfect, but good!
","Too start, the movie reminds me a lot of 'Lord of war', but doesn't mean its a bad movie, its a easy to take & funny movie.Based on a true story, telling the story of 2 young guys looking for money by selling guns to the US army in 2005 ish, but taking the risk too. Of course things start to go bad the + points for this movie 1 good acting 2 pretty locations 3 fair story 4 funnythe - points for this movie 1 movie takes a while 'set off' 2 sometimes boring 3 predictable in the end 4 1 guy has to go 40 years to jail, when the other guy only needs 7 months of house arrest? really Hollywoord? really! That makes zero sense",8,0,0,16 November 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Great. Beautiful & awesome (and no jack forking black)
","Kong. King Kong. Remember that King kong movie with jack black in the 2000's years.. yes me too... it sucked, so when this movie came out i was like 'oh owww' but i gave it a chance and man i loved it! Way better than previous king kong movie's, it kinda reminded me to the Jurrasic Park movie's, Its set in the 1970's, 2 scientist find a new island in the south pacific ocean, the island possibly homes cures for cancers and other deceases. after gathering a team of military soldiers they go to the island, it takes about 5 min until you see kong taking down helis.. all crash and the main charchters have to survive after the crash, but they soon find out they are not alone with Kong on the island.My rating is 9/10Don't watch other king kong movies. Watch this one!!!",9,5,10,25 March 2017
