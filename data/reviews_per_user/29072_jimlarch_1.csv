The New World," Very boring.
","This has to be, next to 'Lost In Translation', one of the most boring, pretentious movies I have ever had to endure. The Decalogue was almost nonexistent, the editing was jerky and inconsistent. As for Colin Farrell the man was obviously depressed when he made this movie which accounts for the total lack of expression on his face, other than a lost, forlorn, lovesick gaze. Kilcher was acceptable in her part. Christian Bale was, apart from Christopher Plummer, the only actor worth seeing in this movie, that had any life to him. On the upside the movie was visually interesting for the most part. The sense of loneliness that the settlers must have faced is well portrayed in the movie, as were the harsh conditions. I do not recommend this movie as being worth seeing.",1,2,9,11 January 2007
