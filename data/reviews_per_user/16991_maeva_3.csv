Requiem for a Dream," A TV set for mummy
","A requiem is a 'a song or hymn of mourning composed or performed as a memorial to a dead person'. Is it the death of a dream, of the death of someone because of his or her dream?Whichever case, I would watch this film again because it does show real humans all the way from shear innocence, up through their emotional richness and combats, down to the numbness of it all. It reminded me of the movie-documentary made in 86 about Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols, a band close to my heart for guys and girls of my generation. In both cases, the grandeur that seems accessible at a certain times in life (no matter what age), and even easy to grab, brings unexpected downfalls, generally not reversible. Incidentally it was right on the spot within its most minute details. The 'TV set for mum' episode struck me cause it reminded me of a colleague of mine turned in no time into a cocaine addict-dealer and of the huge television set he had offered his mum for Christmas... Same social background as in the film, same legitimate ideals turned into megalomaniac transfer leading to decay, possibly to death. I have traveled a lot and made a point in keeping clean, but I have met more than one kid who didn't and I'm still amazed on how fast drugs can drag you down the drain. I do not see the plot as exaggerate, but as very well documented. I was not shocked by it, I was impressed by its honesty and almost scientific clarity. I loved the hip- hop pulse, clear, bright images, very appropriated to the feel of the message. I have no doubts it is a testimony against drugs, from someone perceptive and well documented. This movie is realistic, beautifully brought together, vivid and yes, alive. The good thing about DVDs is that you have special features, interviews (one of Hubert Selby) and insights in the making. There's only one likely scenario with drugs, and old Selby as well as young Aronofsky have written and directed it for us, majestically.",9,1,2,24 September 2004
Requiem for a Dream," Utterly, profoundly appalling
","I would have really liked to enjoy it. I did try hard After all, it took two and a half hours of my life. First of all, the image was crap; Who was the moron holding the camera, anyone knows his name? Secondly I couldn't get what was really happening (that's when I started to put my attention on the crappy camera work). Thirdly it was unnecessarily sexual, violent, and pompous, since each character had as much personality and depth as a cockroach. Those who can change a pathetic patchwork of nothingness into entertainment with the help of illegal substances, have all my admiration. But what's left for us who prefer to leave our clean pink crispy little neurons untouched? A movie like Cidade de Deus, can be a good choice. Or perhaps Requiem for a Dream (incidentally, two anti-drugs masterpieces).",9,0,1,24 September 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Quentin, you're fired!
","What puzzles me is not the film itself, but the popularity such a piece of non-cinema has risen in this country and elsewhere. The very same plot was already very successfully approached in 1968, by Francois Truffaut, in his 'The Bride Wore Black'. The difference being that, at that time, there really was a story, there really was suspense, and whoever the characters, they all seemed human. In other words, they had FEELINGS. Tarantino seems so much hypnotized by style, that unless you're not a movie-freak, there is no way in which you can't keep on noticing references after references of a superficially exploited collection of stylish movements (mangas, comic strips, Samurai movies, pop culture, watered down atmospheres specific to such or such director, etc.)This time, his only apparent goal is how to overwhelm the viewer under a shower of violence and ox-blood No storyline whatsoever, no purpose, no way to identify ourselves with any of the characters, except for Bill's, the only one who seems to have some sort of emotions, and who incidentally is a psychopath (any contradiction here?)After viewing it, mostly in fast forward mode during those endless figures of sword combats, I asked myself what kind of irreconcilable trauma poor Quent must have suffered in his youth  And again, the targets of his spurs of most sadistic creativity are either women, gays, colored people, or figures of authority (I let you decide which belongs to which in his 3 previous movies). After having had to swallow the exhibitionist and sadistic stances of a New-Born Hollywood shark, here we are again, force-fed with hardly digestible matter and wondering what could be the next step Hard-core porn, real rapes, real mutilations (how much would an actor take to accept to have a limb actually severed in front of the camera?), feces, children's sacrifice??? Besides, the level of language - mostly sarcasms and insults  is in total contradiction with the argument of the movie that 'revenge is a dish that must be eaten cold', thus dispassionately. I really invite you to watch Truffaut's version and a real contribution to breaking taboos or at least, to allowing us to reflect on tricky matters such as vengeance.Sadly, Tarantino only talks about Tarantino, and about his obvious failure in processing his personal loads of hostility towards the world or God only knows what else. Pathetic and, even more dangerously, totally deprived of any sense of humor. To be discarded Quentin, you are perverting the very purpose of the 7th Art Will that be your last film? In the meanwhile, you are fired Next, please!",1,20,37,14 September 2004
