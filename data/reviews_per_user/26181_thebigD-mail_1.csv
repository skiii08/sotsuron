Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Sad but true!
","This movie show's the real Americans, it shows how primitive and how not educated are people all over the America. BORAT (BORAT for president). Like I said: Sad but true!!! I sow I must write minimum of 10 lines so I have no other idea as I write just something. Borat you are great, you are super, I hope you will candidate for president next elections. You are the one of rare people who had the guts to show to the people all over the world how are the Americans like. Be well and I hope you will join Michael Moore by his documentaries. I know you two would be a great couple by showing the truth about American people. Signed: Opposer of American politics!",10,2,14,25 November 2006
