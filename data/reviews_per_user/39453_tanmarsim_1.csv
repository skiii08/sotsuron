Child 44," Truth hurts... so Russian trolls are out in force!
","Don't let the Russian trolls dissuade you from watching this movie. The fact that this movie was banned by Putin's censors ( truth hurts! ) is in itself a very good reason why you should see it.This is a good portrayal of the grim, awful reality of life under the Stalinist regime and it shows very well what this murderous, totalitarian system ( that the Russians invented and wanted to spread all over the world ) was like and what it did to people. It crushed their conscience and the backbone of their humanity. It killed morality and any innate goodness of mankind. It created a Homo-Sovieticus who is still alive and kicking in today's Russia. And yet, no matter how much suffering and how many victims this monstrous system created, there are still communism apologists in today's Russia ( and elsewhere in the loony left western media world ) that just can't accept the simple truth that communism was as bad as Nazism. That's why they don't want you to see this movie, that's why they will tell you it's rubbish not worth seeing. Don't listen to them, just go and see this movie and decide for yourself.",8,40,95,17 April 2015
