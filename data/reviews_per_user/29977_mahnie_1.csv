Ali," I actually didn't watch the whole thing.
","The fact that I didn't finish watching Ali pretty much says it all.  I was very disappointed in the film, although I was impressed by Will Smith.  I think it's a shame that a performance like his was wasted on this bafflingly dull movie.  So much pertinant information was consitantly left out of the story line that it was simply mystifying.  I kept waiting to be drawn in, waiting to understand, waiting to CARE.  Perhaps if I had continued waiting... but shouldn't I care a little after a whole hour and a half?Bottom line: Don't waist your time.",Null,0,0,4 May 2002
