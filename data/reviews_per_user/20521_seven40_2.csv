Requiem for a Dream," Not easy. Engulfing. Bleak beyond compare. Wildy effective.
","_Requiem for a Dream_ makes _Pi_ look like a children's movie.  I can't believe what I have just seen: a story well-told using the illusions possible in film as an active part of the narration. It's not a story about addiction: It's an experience of addiction.I noticed several times that I was sitting with my jaw hanging open as I followed the story from summer to winter.  The characters' lives are so screwed up that spring is not possible. The bathos of finding a future satisfying for the younger characters is unimaginable.I loved the film even though it was the most disturbing film I have ever seen.  It's not a ride in the park, and it's not dark like _The Piano_ was dark.  Not even close. Don't take friends unless you know they like high style and can handle bleakness.  Most people will leave the theatre if this is not their cup of tea.",10,0,0,11 November 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Subtle, slow, engaging, and limp
","Just saw it, and thought about sitting through it again, but decided I didn't want to.I did like it.Eyes Wide Shut was like a big, jeweled ball, fascinating to look at and experience, but ultimately nothing more.  The press about the crafting is accurate, and maybe I can understand the length of production.  I didn't think it was very sexy however, and I don't think that's just because I'm gay.  It was more than sexy, it was something new that we've seen before: the art of Stanley Kubrick.  [What does that mean John?]  (I don't know.) It did have a plot, and a strange, somehow suspicious, message. Kubrick was self-indulgent in making and editing Eyes Wide Shut, but I felt self-indulgent watching it.  The use of light was fantastic, really the most memorable part of the film. I could understand why people were laughing, but I was not laughing.  The movie carried itself. Two women stopped us outside the theatre and surmised that we'd just seen it.  They'd walked out and wanted to know how it ended.  I said, 'You walked out.'  We didn't tell them.",8,0,0,16 July 1999
