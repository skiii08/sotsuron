Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Is nowhere near as good as the first trilogy
","I truly do not get it. This film, according to the IMDB users, is in the top 90, and 'Titanic' is bumped off of the list? I cared about the characters in 'Titanic', and also in 'A New Hope', 'The Empire Strikes Back', and 'Return of the Jedi.' With the notable exception of Jake Lloyd, most of the actors in this film are exceptionally wooden. The visuals are stunning, but I want a reason to root for the characters BESIDES the fact that I  know what happens in the other movies. Well, at least I can take solace in the fact that this film is NOT going to pass 'Titanic' like everyone predicted. That honor will go to 'A New Hope' which was made when Lucas remembered that characters were more important than visual effects....",3,0,1,30 June 1999
Memento, 'Memento' is not unfair to diabetics.... ,"Many things went through my mind as I saw 'Memento', but the last thing I was thinking about was how 'helpless' or 'invalid' diabetics are. Sammy Jankis' wife has her husband give her insulin injections, but that is clearly HER CHOICE. Obviously, she can give herself injections if she has to. Sammy's wife doesn't die because diabetes has made her helpless, but rather because she doesn't believe that his short-term memory loss is a real condition. She gambles that if she asks Sammy to give her another insulin shot after he has 'forgotten' it, his love for her would snap him out of this condition and her 'old Sammy' will return. Unfortunately, she's wrong and dies as a result of her gamble. Since it was Leonard's advice that ultimately led her to take this action, he is haunted by her story throughout the film. But none of this would have happened if she gave herself the insulin shots.I am not an expert in diabetes, but criticism of this film that it demeans diabetics reminds me of Italian-American groups that slam masterpieces like 'The Godfather', 'GoodFellas', or 'The Sopranos' simply because they depict Italian-American characters as gangsters......",Null,0,0,13 April 2001
Memento," A brilliant idea that's masterfully executed.
","'Memento' opens with the shot of a man holding a photograph of a bloody corpse. As the man shakes the photograph, the image starts to waver and fade, until it becomes the blank image that you initially see when a photo emerges from an instant camera. It becomes clear that this is a sequence shot with high-speed film backwards. Writer-director Christopher Nolan establishes two things right away. The first is the structure of the movie, which will go backwards in time from the murder shown in the opening scene to the moment when that murder becomes inevitable. The second is a visual metaphor for his protagonist's condition: Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is brain damaged and cannot convert short-term memory into long-term memory. Ever since he confronted two burglars who sexually assaulted his wife, any new person, place, or object he encounters fades from his mind like the image you see in the opening scene. This leaves Leonard with a huge handicap because he is determined to kill his wife's murderer.We don't have to wait long before we see Leonard kill the man he thinks is responsible. In the opening moments of the film, we see Leonard shoot Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) point blank in the back of his head. The initial footage is shown backwards, and then we successively see a short scene that leads up to Teddy's murder. This is followed by another that begins earlier, and the pattern will continue throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan uses this narrative technique to put us in Leonard's state of mind. Like us, he doesn't know what happened earlier. But because WE know the future, we slowly begin to glean how different characters are using Leonard and how he tries to learn the truth about his wife's death.But there's another reason that Nolan tells the story backwards. Since we know that Leonard is going to kill Teddy, we do not ask ourselves 'whodunit' as the picture progresses. What we want to know is whether Teddy really is the man who killed Leonard's wife, or is Leonard being set up by someone like seductive bartender Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss)? Nothing is quite like it seems in this mystery, and the viewer has to pay close attention to gather all the clues. Fortunately, it isn't that hard to follow since Nolan punctuates each vignette with a striking visual image. Thus at the conclusion of each scene, we immediately recognize the beginning of the earlier episode, so we know how everything fits together.  (Give credit to cinematographer Wally Phister, who does an outstanding job in this film.) Also, between the episodes we see a flashback of Leonard in a hotel room explaining his situation and the sad story of Sammy Jenkis to a mysterious caller on the telephone. (This sequence is shot in black-and-white to distinguish it from the other scenes.) Not only do we learn more about Leonard's condition in these scenes, but also his guilt for how he treated Jenkins, a man with a similar handicap whom Leonard investigated when he was an insurance claims expert. Sammy Jenkins' story becomes vitally important as the movie progresses.This is one hell of a concept for a movie when you think about it, and Nolan did a very good job directing. But his direction would not have been enough without the terrific performances given by the principles. Guy Pearce (best known for his role in 'L.A. Confidential') gives a haunting performance of a man who has to constantly reassemble the pieces of his shattered life minute by minute. Carrie-Ann Moss is more than just a pretty face who usually turns up in movies like these, but a very good actress who is alternately both tender and manipulative to Leonard. Joe Pantoliano's loquacious performance as the doomed Teddy is reminiscent of a young Joe Pesci. He almost never stops talking and he often leavens the story with humor. His Teddy seems like a pal, but you're never completely sure how far you should trust him. If there's any justice, all three of these performers will be rewarded with Oscar nominations next year, and Guy Pearce will grab a trophy like his 'L.A. Confidential' co-stars Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe.To sum up, I cannot recommend this movie any more highly than I do. It is not often that I feel compelled to see the same movie twice within 24 hours, but that is the case with 'Memento.' After you see this, you will probably want to discuss the film with other people who have seen the whole film. If that's the case, I urge you to go to the IMDB message forum for 'Memento', and keep the secret from others who don't want to learn any spoilers prematurely.....",Null,0,0,8 April 2001
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," One of the best films ever made about love and relationships
","I won't give away any spoilers. All I will say is that I never got around to seeing this film in the theatres, and I wondered why this film was voted 'Best Film' by IMDb users. Now I know. This film fully deserved to win Best Original Screenplay, and it's a crying shame it did not get more nominations, particularly for Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet (her best work since 'Titanic') As much as I loved 'Titanic'---and I still believe that film deserved to win Best Picture---this film is grounded in a reality that cuts deeper to the bone. It's one thing to recreate the sinking of an ocean liner in exquisite detail, but it's another to recreate the joys, sorrows, and pain that love brings out. In hindsight the debate over whether 'Titanic' or 'L.A. Confidential' seems rather silly. This film is better than both.",10,2,5,3 July 2005
Titanic," Congratulations, Titanic bashers!
","You managed to push this film off the IMDb top #250 list and push its rating down to 7.5. Now I would not say this is the greatest film ever made (that honor should go to 'Seven Samurai' or even the best American film ever made (that honor should go to 'Casablanca'), but you can't tell me that there are more than 250 films better than this one. Certainly not 'The Three Colours' trilogy, the most overrated set of foreign films to come out in recent years!I just have one request for the more than 18,000 people who felt compelled to vote for this movie--please rent 'The Quiet Man.'! Only 900 people have bothered to vote for this masterpiece which is far greater than 'Titanic'--and I'm a 'Titanic' fan! If nearly 20,000 watch this film and vote their honest opinion, there is no doubt that 'The Quiet Man' would vault to the top 10 in the top #250 list. Thank you very much.",10,2,3,21 March 1999
Titanic," Terrific film, with an underrated screenplay.
","I read 'A Night To Remember' when I was in high school,and remember seeing the 1953 film on television (it looks hokie today  but it seemed gripping when I first saw it) so I looked forward eagerly to seeing James Cameron's movie--especially when early reviews suggested it was pretty good. I expected to see a meticulous depiction of the ship itself as well as a harrowing re-enactment of the sinking. What I did not expect was to be as moved by the human story. Several people have asked why Cameron felt he had to include a fictional love story in a story about a real-life tragedy. First, the Jack-Rose love story gave the moviegoer a chance to see most of this great ship while exploring the different worlds of first-class and steerage. Secondly, and most important of all, Cameron felt that if he made you care about the fate of two fictional people,it would make the fate of the 1500 real people who died on the Titanic seem more tangible and concrete.I can understand if a lot of people resent Leonardo DiCaprio. (In my opinion, he got too much of the credit that should have gone to Kate Winslet.) But I don't understand why people think this movie is badly written. Some of the lines do have a contemporary ring to them, but the characters are vividly drawn, and the screenplay is much better than is given credit. A beautiful example of good writing by Cameron occurs in the scene where Rose almost jumps off the stern of the ship. Jack tells Rose what it feels like to fall through thin ice and get immersed in freezing water. Not only does this serve the practical purpose of getting Rose to want to come back aboard the ship, it prepares the audience for what Titanic's victims will feel when the ship sinks. Other versions of this tragedy watch the ship from a distance and makes the audience feel they are safe in the lifeboats. In contrast, James Cameron makes the audience identify with the unlucky ones left on the ship and dying in the water. And as in Seven Samurai, because the audience recognizes and comes to know several of the passengers and crew, their deaths have all the greater impact when the ship finally sinks.",10,0,2,2 January 1999
