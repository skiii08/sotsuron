The Monuments Men," Very disappointing movie
","The theme of the movie and the players looked very promising and was on my must see list. There have been a host of excellent films recently that have appealed and delivered but this one did no credit to the people who offered their lives to save millions of pieces of art and sculptures from destruction and loss collected by the Nazis during WW2. Sort of British 'Dads Army' replica. The cast, which includes Matt Damon, John Goodman, Bob Balaban, and Bill Murray, seemed not to really be on the same set and appeared more like boy scouts on a summer camp and not in the middle of the battle ground in the center of WW2. Sure, the story itself is very interesting, but Clooney quite frankly did nothing to create any emotion. Cate Blanchett, played the French curator Claire Simone, is the lone bright spot here, turning in a performance that actually looked like she cared about the outcome of the movie.",5,6,9,19 February 2014
