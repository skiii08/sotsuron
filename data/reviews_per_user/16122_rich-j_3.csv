Antz," A great night out
","This is GREAT fun.  The animation is just terrific, but this alone doesn't make a good film; what do the animators have to work with?The plot is good and the screenwriters pull off some snappy dialogue, but the real plaudits have to go to Casting; the voices are perfect.  For the first time in a film, I found myself warming to Woody Allen (Z) rather than wanting to smack him in the chops and tell him to get a grip.  A little restraint means that he's winning rather than whinging.The film also avoids two animation bogeys: 1) The human is only seen from about the knees down (Toy Story's whole make-believe world fell apart when they introduced the kids; they weren't REAL enough!) and 2) There weren't any `cute sidekicks'.  These are starting to be a real pain in Disney films and, from the trailers I've seen, it looks like we'll have to endure them in `Bug's Life'.I didn't notice any bad language, but I suppose all this might prove is how constant exposure inures us to it.  Yes, there are some dark moments but, in the UK, Antz does have a Parental Guidance rating.And, anyway, who says animated films have to be for kids?",9,0,0,18 November 1998
Blade," Would have been great at 90 minutes
","Beginning was brilliant; end was very good (marred by the Attack of the Killer Tomatoes on Dorff); middle dragged.Like so many movies today, this tale would have been better told in an hour and a half.",Null,0,0,27 November 1998
The Truman Show," A missed opportunity
","A group of us went to see this film, all wanting and expecting to like it. We'd heard that Hollywood had dared to produce a film with a new, fresh idea.  Alas, we were all disappointed.  Was it meant to be a comedy? It wasn't funny.  Was it meant to be a thriller?.  It wasn't thrilling.It *is* a great idea, but the film should be very dark, very sinister; it was way too light-hearted.  Stop and think for a second.  After 30 years, the guy discovers his whole life's a lie!  He should be consumed with pain, paranoia, anger, but what do we get from Jim Carrey?  The usual rolling eyes and sub-Jerry Lewis grimaces.  He can't act 'paranoid', can't act 'angry'; heck, just can't act.  Back to the fart jokes, Jim.Things looked up whenever the always-reliable Ed Harris appeared but just as I began to get interested, it'd be back to the mugging and grimacing routines.What a shame that Peter Weir allowed Jim Carrey to mar what could have been a great film.",Null,0,0,5 November 1998
