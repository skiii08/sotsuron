Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The better half but the whole bloody affair is better.
","This review will be split into two parts, one were i talk about this movie and one were I talk about the new version of this movie and part one called Kill Bill the whole bloody affair.Kill Bill vol 2:This was a so genius move by Tarantino. After having done one of the goriest and most violent movies of all time, going back to the brides back story and give the character more depth. This movie have arguably one of Tarantinos better scripts and i would say it could have been executed better. The way that they tell the brides back story is so genius, I will not spoiled to much but it's a scene were she need to have a specific skills and then they going back to show her training. Many people is disturbed by the fact that the finally is more talk the talk then walk the walk but I ain't because it's make this movie so much more emotional and the story comes full circle. If you want me to mention something that could have been better executed I say Esteban that is bad overacting and an Mexican accent that doesn't work.Without the whole bloody affair this is my 5th favorite movie by Tarantino, my favorite director. Kill Bill The whole bloody affair:This is Kill Bill volume 1+2 in one movie with some improvements. For you who can't find this movie or don't want to buy it, I recommend (( fmovies.com (were you don't even have to download it or signing in)). And for you who haven't seen Kill Bill vol 2 at all I recommend you to see the whole bloody affair first because it's one scene in this movie that will change your way to look at Bill to the better, maybe forever. The Kill Bill vol 2 part is not so different but the Kill bill volume one is and I would still say the Kill Bill vol 2 part is slightly better. Kill Bill the whole bloody affair is insanely highly rated but get's way to less votes to arrive to the IMDb top 250 list. I think this movie deserve to be there and I hope you will help me by watching it and rate it.",9,1,2,19 February 2017
Inglourious Basterds," the most accurate language movie of all time
","In the opening scene we got all this movie gonna be(and maybe a bit more.) Great dialogue. One of the greatest villain of all time. Violence, (the backstory of the main character) and knowing that in this movie the Nazis and in this case the french people not speaking English like Shindlers list.- That is something i totally love about this movie and how Tarantino use it to tell the story is so great and in my opinion that creates the funniest scene in a Tarantino film ever.This movie also has a great classic soundtrack. Outstanding performances especially Christoph Waltz and Brad Pit, really good Tarantino trademark camera-work by Robert Richardson, really high re watch ability and a perfect buildup to the climax that i will talk about now. (Big Spoiler warning) I have nothing against that this movie change history. I actually like that Tarantino sees it like if hes character would have exist they would have change history. But I think that the character in the ending have a little more luck than i like and that they can kill Hitler just because Hans Landa won't their plan to work is not something i appreciates. I have to say though that it makes Landas character deeper which is important for a higher re watch ability but maybe Tarantino could have make so the call from Landa would have been to late or something like that. The end line is however just so smart and is used by many YouTubers when they do videos about the Tarantino universe. This is my 5th favorite Tarantino movie and my 20th favorite movie of all time so far.",9,1,2,11 November 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The best Harry Potter movie.
","(This review contains no big spoilers)Why why why is this movie consider just one of many Harry Potter movie and a perfect build up to part two, this is in my opinion the best Harry Potter movie even as a stand alone film and i will explain why.The movie starts with that Harry will be moved from hes house because hes have been 16 and the spell of hes mothers love have now been broken. We also seen the villains(the Death Eaters) and that Snape have been one of them. They tell us that they have a deceiver among the ministry and that they know that Harry Potter will move. We also know they will try to take control over the ministry. So Harry and hes companies meet the Death Eaters in an epic fight. Harry survives and after that they went to Bill(one of Rons bigger brother) wedding, the death eaters take over the ministry and Harry Ron and Hermione have to flee. At the same time Harry wants to find the Hokruxes to destroy Voldermort.From there on the movie is just plain excellent. It happens so much after that are all linked together in a beautiful way. They also used some connections with was happening early in the movie for example in the beginning of the movie the minister give Harry Ron and Hermione three different objects that both Ron and Hermione used later in the film but Harrys objects function they keep to part 2. The tone is also great it really feels like a dark movie which it is. Because we really have to worry about the friendship between Harry Ron and Hermione which we love so much at the same time it is more important than ever to stay together. But that doesn't mean this movie not have any humor. The reaction when they should flash down the toilet to give one example is really funny. This movie also have a parallel story with the deathly hallows that they used in a good way because it is sometimes important to make the story go forward. The way the story about the deathly hallows is told is just cheer brilliant. I have some complains about the movie. First thing is a scene were they running, the way it's shot is just not my kind of stile. The second thing is that this movie or the part two don't tell us that Voldemorts name has been banned and every time you say it Death eaters comes. That is in the book and that you don't know it makes for some confusing moments. The third thing is more a complain about part two, but it is a scene were you wonder were comes this Hocrux from and it's told in the book. The fourth thing is re watch-ability. I usually think a movie is best the second time you see it. But this movie have been a bit less good with each watching.This is my favorite British movie and my 10th favorite movie of all time right now.",9,1,3,12 November 2016
Apocalypse Now," Apolcalypse Now Redux, Good to be bored.
","All the best scenes in this movie are from the original version, but still I like the Redux version better. That might be because I saw the Redux version first and that might be because I want one of my favorite movies of all time to have some length. But I think the biggest reason is that it isn't the same kind of journey without the Redux material. I prefer to be a bit bored in some minutes and tackle with themes like the french point of war in the war and go deeper on what the soldiers did under the war to give me an ending I like more but especially like the movies more when I think about it, with all this great themes and message this movie tackle along the way.So my theory is this.Sometimes it's good to be bored. You might not look at the Redux material and are entertained but when you finally comes to the finally it's so much more epic and it really feels like they have done everything they could with the material. It almost feel like it's another movie but it have a clear red line and goal which is very important.This is a war masterpiece with outstanding special effects, top notch acting, fantastic camera work and so many great messages about war especially in the Redux version. It have great sound effects and a fantastic red line from start to finish. All around this is the greatest war movie of all time.This is of course my favorite war movie and my 2nd/3 favorite movie of all time.",10,4,6,9 February 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Tips and thoughts about this movie.
","Tips1: It is not a harry potter movie. Yes it takes place in the same universe but both the characters, the tone, the magic and the structure is completely different. So don't think that you gonna see a Harry Potter movie if so you gonna be disappointed.2: don't expect a strong story with a clear goal. This movie is more like. One thing happened their and one thing happened then. The only plot this movie have is what you already have read.3: This movie have some slow parts. But i can sure you you can always expecting you that things will happened again. Thoughts I think it was a movie a bit better than i thought(though I did'nt have high expectation about it). It has great characters and a CGI that is mostly good. Mos of the time it feels like magic that happens and not CGI and the beasts felt real. It had some really clever references to the Harry Potter universe and no one of them makes the original story less good. It had great characters and a very original screenplay. But the screenplay is also what i dislike most in the movie. I like to see movie as one combined story that all makes sense together which is something this movie does'nt have. It also have some really stupid parts like some of the jokes.Overall I would say this movie is as good as the other Harry Potter movies. Some I like better some I like less. The 8 i give this movie is a really weak 8.",7,6,11,21 November 2016
Schindler's List," A movie ruined by inaccurate language
","This movie is a powerful movie, it truly is. It has great performances and it is hard to not crying in the end. But would you like to see the good the bad and the ugly when everybody speak Italian, probably not. You would think what in hell were they doing this is the wild west in USA they should not speak Italian. Actually Spielberg did the exactly same thing with Schindler's list it just that, that people are so normalized with English movie so they didn't care. I think that doing a movie with Nazis speaking English is one of the laziest things you can do. And that the movie is directed by Steven Spielberg one of the greatest directors of all time or that the German have a little German accents does not make me deny that.If you want a review were i talking positive about accurate languages. Be sure to check out my review for Inglourious basterds.",5,4,11,11 November 2016
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Not the best version of this movie, Kill Bill the whole bloody affair is.
",This is in itself probably my least favorite Tarantino movie. In my opinion Kill Bill is one movie and I don't think the stand alone version is so great. This movie have a scene that is partly in black and white and it have parts that is from the part 2 which disturb me because I love to see part one and part 2 after each other.But I have find the Kill Bill version that is perfect for me: Kill Bill the whole bloody affair.Even if you want to see Kill Bill as separate films I recommend you to check this out because it have an expended anime montage and an in my opinion better version in color of the fight against the crazy 88. I recommend (( fmovies.com (were you don't even have to download it or signing in)) for you who can't find it on blue ray or DVD /Don't want to buy it.Kill Bill the whole bloody affair is highly rated but get way to less votes to arrive to the top 250 list. I think this movie deserve to be there and that's why I write this review.,8,0,1,13 February 2017
Pulp Fiction," The best movie of the best movie year
","1994 is the best movie year ever, I even think that is a fact.My top 10 in no particular order.The Shawshank redemption.Forest Gump. The lion king.León the professional.Speed.Natural born killers.Ed wood.dumb and dumber.True lies.and of course this one. So what make this movie the best (in my opinion). 1: DialogueThe dialogue in this movie is not plot driven. The purpose with the dialogue is to set up the characters and entertain the audience, that it succeed with. The dialogue is also what makes this movie so funny. Tarantino (the director) like to use phrases that means the same thing as more common use phrases but is so much funnier. 2: ActingAmazing dialogue without a good delivery is nothing and a great script without characters you like is not nearly as entertaining. Luckily for this movie the acting is great and they deliver the dialogue perfect (Especially Samuel L Jackson). For example Vincents reaction when Mia came back home from the heroine overdose, that is some serious acting. And don't forget this movie brought John Travolta back to life.3: SoundtrackEvery scene(Except maybe the Vincent talking with Butch scene) that could have been kind of boring Tarantino filled with music that pretty much everyone can enjoy, the driving montage, sun of a preacher man, girl you'll be a woman soon and the dance scene. But the music also is important to set the tone and ad to the fantastic experience that is Pulp Fiction. 4: CinematographyLike the soundtrack the cinematography is just Pulp Fiction. The bright colors and the typical stile Tarantino have when he shot movies. The camera told us that this is a fun experience, not a dark movie.5: The scriptThis might be the best script of all time execute to perfection. It's in the script all the joke is and it is the script that have the perfect linked story. But the script also have the three different time-lines that makes this movie one of the most re-watchable movie of all time.This is my favorite Tarantino movie and my 3d/2nd favorite movie of all time.",10,1,2,13 January 2017
Jackie Brown," The director that will never made a bad movie.
","In my opinion this is Tarantinos weakest movie and to be honest for maybe 45 minutes in the middle, this movie is kind of boring. I know it was to capture the Elmore Leonard talking feeling, but it just did not work out for me. It's also Tarantinos least re-watchable movie in my opinion.I know it's many people out there who say that Death Proof is Tarantinos weakest movie and for you, I recommend you to check out my Death Proof review.With that said I still think Jackie Brown is a solid movie. The characters are good and the story have to be Tarantinos most realistic. The soundtrack works perfectly even if it's one song I dislike, I can still see that it is important to set up the tone. The opening and the ending works very well and especially the 3 perspective shopping montage that feels both clever and original (If it's not stolen from another movie). And the camera work just screams Tarantino, so you still know who is behind the movie. And my final line is this: This guy will never made a bad movie. Death proof was a dead project from the beginning because the Grind house genre is not a very serious one and I would still think most people would agree that it's one of the better movies in it's genre. And this one is still a solid film that works and doesn't lose hes reputation after making Pulp Fiction (One of the greatest movies of all time) that would have give most directors goosebumps. Just the idea of after making two adrenaline pumped movies going back and making this one, just say so much about how skilled and controlled Tarantino is as a director and that's why he will never do a bad movie.This is a solid film that I would have cut a bit in the middle.It's my least favorite movie in Tarantinos filmography and I don't even think it's in my top 100-150.",8,0,2,4 February 2017
