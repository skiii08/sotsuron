Mission: Impossible III," As* kicking movie, with great performances by Cruise, Hoffman and co.!
","Watched it at 04/05/2006 23.59CET. I felt like a geek by being one of the few ones in the cinema hall, but already after the first scene, with thrilling performance by Phillip Seymor Hoffman, I say.... Man this is worth it! I never lost the excitement of watching the movie, and enjoyed it all the time. There's a fair balance between action, effects, humor, romance and stunts... Go and see it now. If you haven't seen the first 2 sequels, don't be whining about it, because you haven't missed anything special....All in all, I would say nice performance, and it was good with some new comers to join Ethan Hunt in his impossible missions, so it wasn't only Tom Cruise who contributed to the movie's perfection.... yeah.... perfect movie!",8,4,7,5 May 2006
