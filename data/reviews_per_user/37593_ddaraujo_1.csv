"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Laughing at our own miseries, the ultimate gift.
","Once again, Australian movie makers reach the top. Following the tradition of 'Muriel's Wedding', we can make fun of our own miseries as human beings. Three gaymen meeting the wilderness of the Australian desert and its people, finding themselves as humans. Three different backgrounds, having to cope with their idiosyncrasies, to survive. Having to cope with an homophobic society, and yet finding love and understanding within it. It's the triumph of laughter over bitterness. With every possible reason to be bitter, they choose to laugh and conquer the hearts and minds of both the spectator and the desert people. You can go from laughter to tears, and in both cases you'll enjoy every moment. Add to a great plot, an astonishing cast, and a 'must have' sound track. That's 'Priscilla'!",9,1,2,28 March 2000
