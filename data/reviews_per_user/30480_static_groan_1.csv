The Ring," non stop suspense.
","the handful of reviews i've read so far on here emphasise the suspense 'The Ring' creates. i was packing myself every second (and now i can't go to bed). i just wanted to comment on the previous reviewer.
*spoilers ahead*The reason why Rachel didn't die was because she kept Samara's 'message' going - by making a copy of the tape. at the end, there was the very fast montage which explained this. that's why she made Aiden make a copy, so that he wouldn't die. so, to keep Samara's message going, whoever watched the tape was to make a copy, and that way they wouldn't die. thankyou, that's all i wanted to say.",9,0,0,22 December 2002
