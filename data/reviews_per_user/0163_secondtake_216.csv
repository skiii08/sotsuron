The Double Life of Véronique," Slow and sometimes self-conscious, but still remarkable gorgeous & moving
","The Double Life of Veronique (1991)Director Krzysztof Kieslowski is one of the undisputed poets of Cold War and post-Cold War cinema. The movies in his Polish/French trilogy, Blue, White, and Red, are finely tuned, sensitive, imaginative dramas that use mystery, music, psychology and visual fluidity to immerse you in another world that is beguiling and fascinating.That's exactly what goes on here. It's a stunning movie-making 'achievement' in how it pulls off this unique blend of amorphous elements, leading you into the ambiguity of the director's invented world. And into the world (or worlds) of the lead characters, both played by Irene Jacob, a classic kind of restrained French (French-Swiss) actress with a limited range, but within that range she has penetrating beauty and a moving, melancholic aura for the camera, which lingers on her face through much of the movie. Her roles as the two women who are classic doppelgangers--they look alike, have similar talents (singing), and both have heart problems. And they overlap in reality for just a few seconds, with only one seeing the other until later, when the other finds she took a picture of the first.This is an unashamedly lofty film. It has high art written all over it, but not in the experimental or cutting edge way of independent filmmakers of this time. Rather, it pushes European mainstream film to its most refined limits, not giving up a narrative logic, not giving up musical scoring and photographic pyrotechnics, and not giving up a cast of beautiful people doing beautiful things. In fact, the star, first shown as a child, is looking at the stars in pure wonder, and the beauty of the world is sustaining and truly marvelous for her--and this I think is the life view of the director. That the world is amazing, filled with odd and beautiful coincidences, and is mostly there to be lived and enjoyed regardless.To some extent, he is both characters, both Veroniques. The allegories of 1980s Europe, splintering under Communism's last few years, have been written about a lot (the Polish Weronika gives herself to her music and dies for it, trapped somehow, the French Veronique is free to reject her talent, travel, and yet, ultimately, end up a puppet to her personal weakness). But the fact is, Kieslowski was both the successful Polish director who died young (though he didn't expect that I'm sure) for his art, and the successful expatriate living a life filled with art and pleasure. He embodied the modern Europe, filled with the heady optimism that led to the love of a new Europe without borders, infinite in its possibilities.It's worth noting that Communism has just fallen when this movie was made. There is a brief scene (the bus scene with the soldiers) that inserts this with, as usual, elegance. (Note here that he again makes the individual's inner needs more important than the greater politics.) The French Veronique is free to be hedonistic, the Polish version cannot quite do that, though you feel her struggle with what to do with her life as a singer.All of this is obviously impressive. For its intentions and its inner coherence, the movie is terrific. But it's also starting to feel self-important, a little overblown in both its allegories and even in the basic doppelganger hook that holds it together. It's also a slow movie. If you don't completely drown, happily, in the aesthetics of the film (which would be easy to do), you might find there are little moments made too important, too detailed, too unaware that the audience is getting ahead of the movie and is restless. For me this was in some of the musical segments, in the marionette scenes, and even in the very last moments, which should have blown me out of the water.Final word. I think it would help to see this film before the Three Colors trilogy, because they are better movies, especially 'Blue' and 'Red.' I have seen 'Red' several times, and it also stars Jacob, and I love it completely still. This predecessor is thinner in comparison, but only in comparison to this remarkable director's startling successes immediately after.",8,13,14,21 August 2010
The Devil's Advocate," Overrated, over slick, laughable acting--it rubbed me the wrong way
","Devil's Advocate (1997)A highly regarded movie in some circles, and I think because of the idea and the intensity of what's implied (implied more than made palpable). Yes, in real life, this would go places. But it's a fairly routine flick with one of Hollywood's least interesting actors in the main role. I'm talking Keanu Reeves, of course. There is the idea of the devil incarnate, which is the big hook of the movie, but this is almost a comic book version, exaggerated and campy.Okay, yeah, there's the familiar thrill of a couple trying to move into high society and finding it filled with evil, carnal and monetary and otherwise. And there's the idea of a lawyer defending a man who is obviously bad, but the job overrides morality. All is well done enough on some level, but what an exaggerated hooha about nothing! This movie makes a mountain out of some very old ideas.Al Pacino? Overacting and painful to watch at times, he's still a reasonable Hollywood devil. Reeves, the pretty boy who can't act? He really can't! More proof. People have commented that this is his greatest film, or that here at least we see him at his best! Hmph. He's reasonable, but imagine a better actor overwhelmed with ambition success and losing his loving wife and his sanity all at once. Now that's a lot of material for an actor to make hay from.So what do we make of the plot, a crystallization of evil? Well, the devil is, of course, a bad fellow. He has infinite power it seems, but uses it judiciously. That makes no real sense, but you have to go with it. Supernatual effects will show up here in all kinds of bizarre and sensationalist places. If that's your thing, and you're a sexist man (there are lots of women who are purely eye candy), go for it. Sorry dudes, it's true. Swallow hard. Not my thing.Finally, the plot is over the top. (John Grisham wrote it, remember.) It's about excess and flashy twists. The Anti-Christ? Sure, go there, for kicks. Vanity? Come on, is that what this was finally all about? Didn't we know that in the first few minutes?Is this an unredeemed mess? Not quite, I suppose. The movie as a whole ends up being a solid supernatural lawyer film, and the script is straight forward narrative stuff —to the point that it seems banal, except you see the screen shifting its shape as you watch.",5,3,7,22 November 2014
The King's Speech," Terrific screen writing, and two actors at their symbiotic best
","The King's Speech (2010)From the title itself through classic encounters of the king with the peasantry to the final speech of all speeches, 'The King's Speech' is fast, smart, and literate. I say literate specifically because this is one witty, word-based movie. A brilliant one. It is visual, too, dramatically photographed (including some unusual extreme wide angle views--not fisheye as Manohla Dargis said), and it is acted with absolute skill. But above all, it is a work of words.Appropriately.David Seidler is the credited screenwriter here, and he has done mostly decent television writing. His one attempt that relates, for 'The King and I' o (1999) was miserably received. Here, he is nothing short of sublime. It might seem easy to play with the conventions of British royalty (the stumbling for the proper words, the decorum), but the dialog goes well beyond that. It is largely a tale of two men, the man who would be King George VI and his speech therapist Lionel Logue, and no one knows what they said to one another.The plot, however, is a given, sort of. The movie is based on fact in the broad sense--the king did have a stutter, Logue was an inventive therapist from Australia, German and Britain did go to war. Memoirs being what they are, and Logue's notebooks being only part of the story, the dialog has come under criticism for his truth. But watch this movie as a work of fiction, somehow, and you'll hear some of the sharpest speechwriting in recent years. Screenwriter David Seidler grew up with a stutter, has had a lifelong fascination with King George VI, and has recently battled cancer, which has a way of giving people perspective. All of this is audible in the film, start to finish.And it's a very very funny movie, or witty in the dry sense. Nearly everything out of Colin Firth's mouth is hilarious, like an inner voice speaking out and surprising expectations. And Logue, played to a T by Geoffrey Rush, is equally hilarious, restrained perhaps but more theatrical by far. The two of them are stunning.The movie is of course limited by its own intentions. Certain things--most things--cannot happen, and don't. The inventions are either liberties that they have gotten thrashed for (see Wikipedia for a long list of corrections) or are little inventions between the facts that make things airy and touching, realistic and pithy. The filming enhances this, and the use of deeply moving music punches up the gravitas more than anything.",9,3,6,8 March 2011
Saturday Night Fever," 1970s Italian New York that ISN'T the Godfather--oh, and John Travolta dancing!!
","Saturday Night Fever (1977)Hey, there's John Travolta dancing and looking cute, and there's a simple look at urban Italian life without the mob in the 1970s, and there is some disco inferno. What more do you want?Hopefully not much, because there is a thin plot, some truly forgettable acting (except for Travolta, who is spot on for this kind of flick), and even the functional details like camera-work and editing are dull as milk. The lights dazzle at times, but don't confuse that with good filming. And the soundtrack, of course--there is the core of the movie, the defining disco sound of mainstream America. But hey, there's John Travolta, and dancing. Turn it up.",5,1,2,29 December 2009
Moneyball," Baseball? Don't even think about it. It's a great insider's view with human drama.
","Moneyball (2011)An extremely competent film, with sharp writing and editing, convincing acting, and a great basic story.That's hardly the words you would use for a great classic like 'Citizen Kane' or even 'Fight Club.' Like that Facebook movie 'Social Network,' you have here a gripping series of events with a hero and a huge opportunity and the movie makes it pop and crackle--even though on the surface it seems like it couldn't possibly be exciting. I mean, lots of board room or back room conversations, lots of brooding about the future. There isn't even a noticeable romantic line to add that personal layer.All of this attests to the raw ability of the movie makers, mostly the director and writer. The director is who, Bennett Miller? A relative outsider with two other movies to his name, I think people are starting to perk up to him. His first movie, 'The Cruise,' few people have seen, but it shows his hand in its attraction to a true situation with insight into contemporary American culture. (It's free on Netflix right now, if you are open to a kind of straight up black and white documentary.) His second movie, 'Capote,' takes us into heartland America and shows he can command a more complicated scenario, some high end acting talent, and edgy crime stuff already part of literary lore and make a compelling sometimes brilliant movie. (Part of the brilliance belongs to Philip Seymour Hoffman, frankly, but the movie is handled with unusual intelligence overall.)So now 'Moneyball' with Brad Pitt, who anchors it with yet another confident, believable performance from him. The world of professional baseball is automatically interesting to many people. And so is the idea of a lone renegade bucking the system, any system, and succeeding (or almost succeeding, at least). Then there is the astonishing winning streak that builds in the center of the movie with inevitable drama (like the one used by more than one movie when Joe DiMaggio was his streak decades earlier). This is great stuff, and it's hard to go wrong.But Miller goes not merely avoid going wrong. He gives this just enough velocity and just enough breathing room to make it fast and comfortable. You inhabit the movie, you root for the heroes, and you feel the situation more than you thought you could, at least on paper.The other main influence is the writer, or properly writers (two of them), though Steven Zaillian is listed first in the credits. Zaillian has a whole slew of highly regarded films on his resume--Schindler's List, Gangs of New York, the new Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, on and on--and he clearly has given 'Moneyball' the slick, smart dialog and story line. But the other writer, for the usual reasons, has gotten the bulk of the attention because (I think) he's been recently associated with 'Social Network,' and that's Aaron Sorkin. (His one other recent credit is the decent Mike Nichols film, 'Charlie Wilson's War.' He mostly known for writing much of 'West Wing,' which is pure television, even if very good television.) But it boils down to a handful of really talented folk putting together a modestly constructed, very smart and engrossing film about something far more fascinating that you'd have ever dreamed. It won't change your life, but it's a must see kind of movie for a quiet night.",8,2,5,3 February 2012
The Avengers," If you're already a fan you'll love it, if not it's yet another well crafted superhero CGI flick
","The Avengers (2012)First: this is high energy stuff with lots of superhero fighting. Lots. Beyond that I had to pick and choose what I liked and what seemed to be dragged out a bit. It was never slow, but it was often a bit uninteresting.the real downside to the movie was, well, the plot, which had yet another super huge super awful enemy that required our local team to go out and find a way to conquer. It never really mattered why these bad people were coming (though they do explain why, with a spacey glowing cube and Thor's half-brother having some childhood issues unresolved). The set design, however, was really ambitious, not only with the huge scenes and big CGI effects, but the range and diversity of interiors with a deliberate variety of styles that related to the different characters. And some of the actors and actresses were terrific to watch, even if they didn't really have much to say or do that mattered (besides save the world, of course).If this sounds like I'm not cut out of this type of movie you are mostly wrong. I have loved, for example, the three Nolan 'Batman' movies, a couple of the 'Spiderman' ones, and a few oddballs here and there, all of which work on some of the same principles of super villain and a modified New York (Gotham, etc.) as a city of resilient victims to save.Small (relevant) confession: I loved the Iron Man movies and never saw any of the other Marvel character movies like the Hulk. In this all-star get together of a half dozen famous super-heroes I naturally loved the Iron Man parts and was neutral on the rest. Mostly because Robert Downey Jr. is a huge cut above the others of the cast in presence, in humor, in making the whole enterprise a comic book come to life, not a serious save-the-world epic. By contrast, the leader of the bad guys is a wan, half-hearted baddie who didn't create the chills or fear the movie badly needed. As a movie of characters taken from various Marvel comic book (and movie) series, it was how fully the characters were realized that made the difference. Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was pretty great, though restrained a bit. The Black Widow in the hands of Scarlett Johansson was stunning to look at but also weirdly restrained (except the fighting of course). Thor was a bore, taking his old school power thing too too seriously. And Captain America, though a likable, cute guy, was also a bad casting job--he had to do more than look good (unlike, say, Gwyneth Paltrow, who simply had to look good since she unfortunately had nothing much to say or do).You'll know if this movie is your thing before you read this or see a trailer. It's a boiler plate super hero action movie with lots of computer effects and a standard villain from the universe menace. (The computer effects, like these skeletal ocean monsters swimming through Manhattan wrecking lots of buildings, are actually, surprisingly, a bit clunky once you start watching the details.) Overall, director and writer Joss Whedon seems a bit overwhelmed here, and has co-written a predictable bit of very expensive contemporary Hollywood stuff and then directed it without quite making it special. Or surprising. I mean, even Samuel L. Jackson is stiff and preachy. The movie has its moments for sure, but that's not enough. Disappointing.",6,6,13,26 May 2013
Angels & Demons," An Awesome Trip to Christian Rome--Just Let the Pesky Plot Zoom!
","Angels and Demons (2009)An Awesome Trip to Christian Rome--Nevermind the Plot!The plot? The plot zips along with an almost hilarious series of cliffhangers and twists of identity, but maybe necessarily. That's the kind of movie it is. It's a great ride, so hear me out.The main scientist characters (yes Tom Hanks as Tom Hanks, though they give his character another name, and his rather dull female sidekick) need to solve a terrible mystery as the world awaits a new pope and a high tech bomb ticks away. There are underground chases and shootings, lots of fire and murder, and an inevitable helicopter scene (listen for the foreshadowing on that one). The hero becomes a villain, the villainous old men become passively agreeable (I never knew the cardinals were such a clubby lot, did you?), and the secondary villain gets his comeuppance without much fanfare or grief.None of this, none of this, matters. Not really. This whole plot idea, not bad not good, is just a way to tour Rome and its Christian era art, especially Bernini. For that alone, it's worth it, and try to catch it in a theater, because the visuals are a treat. The camera-work isn't groundbreaking, but it's alive and gorgeous, thanks to Salvatore Totino (who also provided the one saving grace for the earlier and otherwise disappointing The Da Vinci Code). One scene after another has the camera moving (and moving, and moving) through chamber after church after street after piazza. The light, the art, the set design, and the ambiance (lots of flashlights needed) are great all along. There's even a vision of heaven, sort of, that would make Barberini happy (though without the bees, inside joke).And what about the plot, with antimatter and the predictable Vatican intrigue? It is serviceable. Or better yet, it's perfect because it makes us take the Roman tour as fast as possible without being distracted by silly things like character or emotional depth. The acting isn't bad at all, led by dependable Ewan McGregor, who doesn't get a chance to take off his clothes (it might be on the editing room floor--let's wait for the director's cut someday, like in six weeks). Too bad the script is puerile--he has to give a speech about how science and religion are buddies, and then another about how science is the enemy of religion. Yes, a duplicitous priest. But that's part of the fun. All the old wrinkled men playing old wrinkled cardinals are fine enough, too.Ron Howard directs the way he always directs--with the highest level of conventional craft. He knows how to make a movie move, edited tightly, and with visual panache. For those who can overlook the forced and sometimes preachy or teachy script, it might resemble a great movie. But to me it's not a great movie. It's a great city. And I'll take Angels and Demons in its glib velocity because I can't get to Rome myself. In fact, I could watch it again today just for the ride. And that last scene, when they pull the curtain away and there we are behind the most famous balcony in the world, the light of the day pouring in and countless thousands of people cheering? Even an atheist can appreciate the aura of power and joy and absolute worldly hope of religion. A surprising tear jerker ending. That's good movie-making.",7,3,5,22 June 2009
Vertigo," Desperate love story with murder on the wing
","Vertigo (1958)This movie isn't quite about what it seems to be about at first, and we shift from an odd detective case to a case of falling in love, to a case of just falling, and then the movie goes through one of the most convincing psychological twists in cinema. That is, the second portion of the movie is a brilliant inquiry into the mind of the retired detective played by Jimmy Stewart, and into obsession, and eventually to revelation. While the crime is solved eventually, it's really a small point. This is a love story, and a complicated one but also a passionate one. The ending will leave you gasping.There are celebrated aspects to note: the psychedelic insert in the middle as a dream, the zoom/pull effects of vertigo, even the classic femme fatale/plain girl contrast (the latter a brilliant Barbara Bel Geddes). And there are some less known touches, like the green neon lighting used on the interior of the room at the Empire Hotel, or the generally clear vivid brilliant Technicolor palette. There are bit parts and famous sets (the Golden Gate Bridge and the San Bautista Mission, which didn't actually have a bell tower like this one (that was added through cinema trickery). There is also an amazing use of subjective effects--the light falling improbably, or a haze covering the scene for no reason except the main character's mind. Much of this stuff pushes Hitchcock into true art film territory, and yet he keeps it a mainstream commercial flick that is accessible and popular.Most of all there is subtle deception between characters and between the movie and the viewer. Hitchcock has never preferred the sudden surprise, leaving the viewer in ruins (or just in shock). Instead, he tells you what's going on--in this case, we learn of the murderous truth halfway through the film, so that we aren't wasting energy solving the crime but are instead trying to get into the characters' heads. It is the psychology, and the conflict of desire and doubt, that drive the movie. It's not slow, by the way, it's lyrical.Some people might object to the falseness of many of the key scenes, but that's the nature of films that are not purely naturalistic. And the nature of nearly all of Hitchcock movies after 1940. Absorb the style as brush strokes--they don't get in the way of verisimilitude once you agree the truth is not the point. Drama and beauty and originality are. All of those are here full force.",10,10,14,25 July 2009
Black Swan," As constrained and striving and talented as the leading character
","Black Swan (2010)There are some thrills and some beautiful elements to any movie about the ballet, and to any Darren Aronovsky film, so 'Black Swan' is wired for success. Add hardworking veteran Natalie Portman to the mix, and in a nutshell you have the movie.'Black Swan' has all the feelings of a bold, epic opera, a melodrama with psychological arrows, and fairy tale about being a girl and wanting to make it as the swan, as the ballerina. Us guys can get that, too, even if we don't pirouette so well.Sadly, if not unexpectedly (I've never seen real depth to Aronovsky's universe), there is a constant exchange of sensation for penetration. The writers almost willfully give us plot devices we've seen before. The idea of a person (Portman's Nina the ballerina) who is too uptight to be successful and just has to be less perfect to be more perfect is an appealing but well worn idea. The characters are mostly cardboard clichés, like the bitter and controlling mother and the womanizing and aesthetically superior super-male director, neither of whom we really get to know. Come to think of it, we don't really learn anything about the character of our leading female. Nina is a richly played stereotype. I don't mean she doesn't have a range of emotions, and certainly Portman makes the most of the emotional and physical pain in her memorable performance. The one force-fed diversion from the straight and narrow world of New York Ballet is when Nina steps out and goes nightclubbing, and her disorientation in that world only reminds us of what she is not. But surely her young adult life has had some shaping influences, some quirks of real personality, something besides the apparent trap of being a little girl forever.And then, in what did surprise me for Aronovsky, the filming itself is awkward. The camera-work was really nice, strictly speaking--lots of moving camera, lots of anxiety in the unsteady image. But the light, the lighting, is painfully unexplored, unexploited. Once I noticed this, I couldn't help see how many of the scenes were filmed with a deliberately plain, almost 'ordinary' light. Many movies are of course enhanced by being real world and even 'badly' lit, the characters falling into shadow, the color of the light unappealing. But this is not story about the ordinary. Some of the scenes are even completely imaginary, and others are on the stage, with theater lights. By the last scene, the great performance, with Tchaikovky's music throbbing in the background, there is some sense of light and drama, and yet, amazingly, it is relatively withheld.There are many movies that this one draws on, or draws up next to for comparison, from 'The Phantom of the Opera' which is truly disturbing to any number of Zeffirelli productions which seem to have the same intention to wow the audience above all else, and do so with amazing visual and sonic excess. 'Black Swan' has the intention common to Aranovsky's work to be profound, and this might be the big flaw in his career. That is, I don't think you succeed at trying to be profound. Instead, you succeed at doing something with perception and originality and subtlety, and then you might, as a product (but not a direct goal) discover, or uncover, something that is in fact profound.So, this movie will make you think a little and it is very enjoyable. I found myself laughing out loud a few times when the effort to impress the audience became ludicrous, but at other times I was engaged and impressed. Go with reasonable expectations.",7,3,7,18 January 2011
The New World," A huge masterpiece riddled with flaws? Yes, compelling by the end for sure.
","The New World (2005)This is surely some kind of masterpiece of a movie, though also plagued slightly by its length, by a tendency to sentiment, and by moments of wonder (by the characters) that get repetitive. Director Terrence Malick has left his mark here as with, say, 'Days of Heaven,' creating something large but not quite larger than life. His intention is to make life as large as it really is. By some miracle I saw the whole thing and didn't know it was the Pocahontas story, which was terrific (though I jokingly said in the middle of it that she's like Pocahontas, having never seen the Disney version). This helped me keep a neutral stance on it all, thinking it was just a typical view of two cultures--European and Native American--coming into extensive, complicated interaction. The way you come to see the main young woman's view of the world, both the new world she live in and her own new world when she goes to England, is stirring. Stirring.That's what finally made the movie after having at times to be patient with the director's tendency to indulge in the beauty created by his crew, especially the cinematographers. This is an exquisitely luscious film in many ways--some might say excessively, the sunset always sublime and the verdant world green. But it makes for good watching. It's an immersive experience. It puts you there.The sets and the setting are superbly thought out and legitimate copies of what the first successful English settlers in Virginia would have seen and made. (There were lengthy documentary segments with my rented version of the movie.) The costumes, the thatch and wood structures, the general smoky rainy glimmery twilight moods, all of this was gorgeous. Most (nearly all) of the shooting was done with a hand held camera, what used to be called a steadicam. Even conventional dialog scenes where the camera shows someone talking reveals a little (gently buffered) camera movement. Other scenes have a constantly moving camera, fluid and jerky both. All of this gives the film from start to finish a living, breathing feeling. It's quite nice as a work for the eyes, no question about that.The editing is equally remarkable. Malick has lots of footage shot, and one thing this gives him is lots of options for editing, and indeed the mix of points of view is part of the visual energy of the whole. There are many moments where the edit is unexpected, or very sudden, or counterintuitive, which is elegantly sustained from start to finish.What is weak at times is some of the acting, or some of the choreographed movements, which seem a hair affected, or made to be cinematic rather than true. I suppose that's Malick's choice and a matter of taste. More annoying is the director's tendency to have characters stop and admire the bark on a tree or the light coming from overhead as they crane and look up. Yes, that's what you might do, all of us, but not over and over. And over. In the same way there are sometimes repeating moments that are not quite flashbacks that reprise an earlier mood and in fact it seems (to the slightly bedazzled viewer) that times have changed, that this is not quite where the characters are at any more. In all of Malick's movies he has a style with actors that often makes them restrained and even lifeless. It strikes me as terrible movie-making on some level (Brad Pitt in 'Tree of Life' is hard to swallow), but I try to see it as style. That might be generous. You'll find Colin Farrell restrained, often, and mumbling, too, and what makes clear his lack of usual energy is the documentary videos of the same scenes where he's more himself. It's subtle, I think, but it's cumulative with all the actors over all the film. The one exception might be Pocahontas herself, played by American/Swiss/Quechua Peruvian actress (born in Germany) Q'orianka Kilcher. She's allowed to be utterly lively and a necessary spark amidst all these burly men.One thing Malick has going for him here is the story is epic and moving. The material is automatically interesting. He takes credit (as he always does) as the writer, but of course the story is not his, it's history. And it's a history brought to life. It's not for everyone, but it will survive even doubters on many levels, including for its ambition. This is a sprawling, unique movie and you should give it a try.",8,2,3,18 February 2013
Captain Phillips," Very well made, and very linear, straight forward movie about a wild true story
","Captain Phillips (2013)Straight up excellent movie making about a true story with superb pace and clearly etched characters. It's hard not to like, and to appreciate the main character, played by Tom Hanks, as he does his best to keep his ship and crew safe from pirates.If that's what you're looking for in a movie, this is top notch. The director, Paul Greengrass, is really expert at this kind of action thriller—he did the 2nd and 3rd Bourne movies, which are sizzling. 'Captain Phillips' is by its nature more limited in its plot. It has to stick to the reality of the world at that time, and more or less to the facts. There have been some objections to the actual details of the movie, but I think Greengrass is right when he defends it as true to the big points, which you see (with some astonishment) here.If you want some further element of surprise, or something to make you think, or discover aspects that rise above simply telling a riveting plot, you won't find it here. Except, for me, in the last two minutes of the movie. Here, at last, we not only see the depths of what the captain had to discover in himself, we see the movie take a turn in deciding what to show us and how. Maybe this by itself justifies all that comes before. Or maybe it will make you wish for more of this best aspect. Somehow.",7,3,6,1 February 2014
10 Cloverfield Lane," Part of this are a total 9, but it also drags at times, and is an awkward mash
","10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)This is a tricky movie to review because it tries to do three different things, and it does two of them well. It's a movie that gets so much better as it goes, you hate the manipulative first twenty minutes more and more. The problem is worse because I don't want to give away the plot. There are a few key twists that are part of what makes the movie special. The last section, which I can't outline a bit, is by far the best part, and it isn't given time to develop. Oddly, the last part is also preposterous, and the main character survives against all logic, and the first sections of the film strive for true fictional accuracy.So, ultimately, the point of the film is to surprise and surprise. What really bothered me was the way the first section, where the leading woman is help captive (you learn this right away), tries to mislead us in a sensational way that doesn't make sense with the main central part of the film. John Goodman, the big name here, plays a survivalist who is portrayed as a good guy with a mixed up sense of justice (and some personal loose screws). He's pretty good, though doesn't command the role quite the way he does some others in his career. The shelter he's created is elaborate, and the crisis outside the shelter is kept ambiguous— and doubtful—which is a great bit of suspense. The final section almost seems to suggest a sequel—one that would be utterly different than this film. Watch for it (if it happens) because it should be fun.",6,16,23,11 November 2016
The Sound of Music," Not a breakthrough, nor a disturbing masterpiece, but a masterful entertainment--a great musical!
","The Sound of Music (1965)Not a breakthrough, nor a disturbing masterpiece, but a masterful entertainment--a great musical!Rogers and Hammerstein need no praise from me, and their work for The Sound of Music is so embedded in everyone's head--do, re, mi--they border on timeless, without exaggeration. Starting as a smash 1959 Broadway musical and running for years (followed by years in London), it was only a matter of time before Hollywood put together a smash widescreen version. Director Robert Wise was a perfect choice in some ways. Despite years of making less fanciful movies (I Want to Live, for one), he had one notch on his belt worth noting: West Side Story. And so the 70mm cameras were pulled out and the Austrian Alps hosted the cast and crew for the location shooting (the rest was shot mostly in Hollywood). A legendary film was born, Julie Andrews rose higher into the firmament, and the whole world was singing 'My Favorite Things.' It doesn't get any better than that.As a movie--the editing, shooting, acting, and so on--it is surprisingly good without being one bit original or breathtaking. It is famously saccharine, and the question is mostly whether you can stomach some very very sweet (some would say goody-goody) scenes. But listen, this is a musical, and musicals are like that--false and arch and absurd and dreamy. That's one reason we make them and watch them. The plot is a terrific romance, really--it develops predictably, but slowly, with delicious restraint. And it has the best of antagonists, too--cold hearted Nazis. The famous ending, and I mean the very end, after the convent scene at night, is weirdly brief, and shot from so far away you only get the gist of things, not any actual faces or reactions. Maybe this makes its message of hope and perseverance more universal.But all this said, it is surely the music itself that makes this movie astonishing. I have seen the movie too many times to count, but hadn't seen it recently, and as one familiar song after another came up, I heard melodies that felt as right as a good hat, lyrics that rolled into the air like laughter. It is all easygoing stuff, for sure, but slyly sophisticated, much more difficult to pull off than you can imagine (ask Stephen Sondheim). And even if Julie Andrews isn't your cup of tea, she sings with such clear ease, and in tune, and without a lot of self-conscious warbling. The music, from her, permeates the movie as fully as the scenery.Is it a perfect movie? Oddly, it is perfect at what it does, which sounds like I'm saying 'it is what it is' and I don't mean to be silly. I mean, it wants to be a family movie filled with sentiment and warmth and uncomplicated psychology. And lots of great music. And it does that to a tee. It's hard to complain that it doesn't raise social issues, or the photography is pretty but stiff as masonite, or the acting is clichÃ©d, or the plot is saccharine (yes). All of these are true, but that's like complaining that the songs in a gangster film aren't sweet enough. The Sound of Music is an engrossing, perfect, heartwarming experience if you let it be. It's a musical, remember, just a terrific musical.",9,3,11,25 September 2009
Source Code," Well made and fast paced, but a little been there done that and a little too improbable
","Source Code (2011)It's easy to say this could have been a great movie, because it has some great elements, but it's also easy to notice how derivative the basic ideas are, too. And so this is a decent thriller with lots of issues left hanging. I think some people will totally love it, especially if they haven't seen, or maybe if they have, the inspirations for it.That is, the structure of the film is a series of variations on a single set of events, returned to over and over with twists and alternatives explored, many of them imaginative. A very differently styled predecessor is 'Run Lola Run' but I think 'Source Code' is a more direct echo of recent American films like 'Momento' or 'Vantage Point.' It's a little like 'Inception' meets 'Groundhog Day,' actually, and that's not all bad.The main character who is reliving (or seeming to) the main event, the blowing up of a Chicago commuter train, is a war veteran played by Jake Gyllenhaal. He's good, very good, if not astonishing (you might consider Bruce Willis in 'Twelve Monkeys' for a definition close to astonishing, believe it or not). The talking head (mostly seen on a video screen) that helps him through his various incarnations is Vera Farmiga, always a trustworthy presence on screen. Everyone else, from the terrific scientist in the background (Jeffrey Wright) to the bland but serviceable girl and would be girlfriend (Michelle Monaghan) are support to the main pair, or even just to Gyllenhaal, who carries the show.The rest of the movie is eye popping effects, high tension whodunnit terrorism, and interior soul searching in a sci-fi kind of superficial way. It's fine, but it's been done better before. And there are some logic bending requirements that you can go along with most of the time, but reluctantly. By the last few minutes, when there is one ridiculous last twist, it's just a matter of saying, loudly, 'Whatever.' This is almost the definition of a summer blockbuster--well made, fast, undemanding, interesting, fleeting. And it's a month early, so maybe there are more decent things to come.",7,6,11,20 May 2011
Skyfall," Really solid and well made, though it really does lack originality. Never boring, never amazing.
","Skyfall (2012)In many ways this is a return to a full-fledged Bond archetype. The special effects are still spectacular, and the tricks and impressive smarts and physical stunts are still terrific. But here is the man, James Bond, with a sense of history, character, persona. And just as the Nolan Batman movies rise above through character development, so does 'Skyfall' make the most of the essence of 'Bond' the legend and uber-spy.The key to this was in the middle of the opening chase and fight scene, highly and wonderfully improbable, where he lands after a series of crashing and crushing cars (VW Beetles as his sidekick almost too obviously notes), suddenly he's inside a train car full of passengers and before dashing for his life after the bad guy, he straightens his cuff. That, after all, is James Bond, with gorgeous suits as important as gorgeous women.Walking out with my girlfriend slightly unimpressed by the whole two hours plus of this, despite the strong beginning, I heard the key to it all. She said it wasn't fantastic enough, it didn't push the edge enough. Think of Dr. No or other early villains with their incredible complexes of evil set in exotic locales. And I think she's right, because this lacked some kind of unique 007 flair. It's a really well made movie, exciting and bold, that much we can all agree on. But guess what? That's the norm these days. There are so many movie with tremendous chases, fights, fireballs, and even crashing trains these aren't distinguishing traits anymore (including the 'Incredibles,' which borrows tropes like they were your neighbor's tools).What's new? In a way the biggest 'trick' is the dipping into the past, literally. A classic Austin is pulled out complete with machine guns mounted in the grill. A joke is made about low tech gadgets like the radio (a radio!) he is given, and then it saves him. And there is Moneypenny, the twist being only that she is now black. I'm not sure that's a triumph--I'm ready for a black Bond, actually. Now that, think about it, is new. It's a new world. Check out the U.S. elections.What about Daniel Craig? This is his best Bond, to my naive eyes (I'm a Sean Connery fan at heart). But he manages a coolness that doesn't just become lack of life. The 'women' around him (a Bond cliché) are actually held in check, so we aren't subjected to the same sexualized objectification as the earlier films. Good.And Javier Bardem? He's great. But he's no Joker (either Nicholson or Ledger). In fact, the whole attempt at being outrageous (the computer stuff, the glass cage) is painfully small minded stuff. Maybe this is Sam Mendes's fault, ultimately. He's a first rate director, but normally plays deft with psychology and creepy human types, not action-adventure. See it. It's a good film, a good Bond film. The fact it isn't what it could have been by several important levels is not so terrible. It's fun, powerfully made, and a necessary step in the evolution of the genre--the genre of its own making, Bond, James Bond.",7,4,11,9 December 2012
Casablanca," The writing, the character actors, the lighting, and then, for dessert, some romance, too. Oh, and America goes to war at last.
","Casablanca (1942)When Rick (the inimitable Bogart) says to Sam (the inimitable Dooley Wilson), 'If it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?' he's announcing to everyone that this is a movie about Pearl Harbor. That is, it is about this hardboiled, pre-noir American type, who sticks his neck out for no one, and his growing need to go to war.Need and desire. That's part of the compelling mood of the movie--everything feels like it has to be so. Americans are (by implication) really good at heart, and of course we'll come to the air of pretty Norwegians trapped by love and reluctant Frenchmen trapped by circumstance and all those very interesting lovable refugees (some real refugee actors), trapped by Nazi meanness and brutality, plain and simple.The romance? That, in a way, is the MacGuffin, not the other way around. Certainly, the famous end to the movie leaves the romance in the dust. Casablanca is a call to arms, for all the best reasons, and it appeals across the decades, too. In fact, the movie premiered on Thanksgiving, 1942, so the U.S. is fully in the war by the time people see it. And it resonates as a confirmation, and almost as prescient. We trust Bogart, by now, to be the right kind of man in every circumstance, just like our own men, husbands, fathers, brothers on the field.These great things don't make the movie great. Not as a movie. The writing, above all, does that (the Epsteins labored and were as inspired as they were gifted in this, with Howard Koch). But the filming is gorgeous, every scene filled with dense layers foreground to back, including layers of light, and often moving light, from searchlights and passing cars, or in the café as the lights move from piano to band and so on. Actors move across the screen in fluid conversation, sometimes for a laugh, often for a drink, eventually to see Rick, or to fret about getting out, getting to Lisbon, getting to America. It's all idealized and frightening at the same time. The bit actors are astonishing, the direction by the seasoned but unexceptional Curtiz is compact and elegant. Bogart is perfect. There isn't much to say new, or old, that's worth the time here, with everything out there so well said already. Just Google the movie and read away. Or better yet, watch it again. If you think you've seen the movie enough, look beyond plot and really listen to the writing, and watch the camera-work and lights. It's not a great film by accident, and it doesn't hide why it's great. There are better films, I suppose, of course there are, depending who you ask and on what day. But not many.",10,4,5,17 October 2009
In Bruges," At first beautifully slow, then just slow, and then a bit forced...
","In Bruges (2008)A quiet film about a couple of hit men hiding in Bruges, one of them loving it (played by Brendan Gleeson) and the other (Colin Farrell) bored and unappreciative. They run into trouble in several ways, mainly learning that they are not there to hide out after all, but this only turns into a kind of shoot 'em up climax that isn't what the movie's arc really intends. A couple of side characters have some effect on events, mainly a drug running love interest (Clemence Poesy) who is meant to be searing and different but comes off a bit stilted, and a dwarf in a movie being filmed there (Jordan Prentice) who is charming and a little incidental after all.What really works best is the screenplay. The writing is sharp, and the idea, offbeat within a large and well-worked genre, develops with some nice turns. Oddly, the back and forth humor between these hit men doesn't quite gel despite their good dialog, and I think it's just bad casting or bad directing, because Gleeson and Farrell sure are trying to be ironic and wry and a bit doltish. Maybe they try too hard. Or maybe it really is the direction, under Martin McDonagh, who did also help with the writing. This is McDonagh's first full fledged film (he made an earlier prescient short, 'Six Shooter,' also starring Gleeson). The complexity of the plot isn't overwhelming, but the threads seems to coexist rather than interweave. It gets especially single-minded (and heavy handed) when the master hit-man arrives, played beautifully by Ralph Fiennes. The violence becomes a series of tricks and spectacular effects, and it's entertaining but never quite gripping or enchanting or whatever it is this strange series of events is aiming for.Bruges, which plays its own role in the film, is gorgeous, even for a hit-man, and the film was filmed there for good reason. But expect only a slight diversion here, one bubbling with possibility but falling flat on the tongue.",6,1,4,4 May 2011
John Wick," Non stop monotony--beautifully filmed but a linear plot
","John Wick (2014)I thought the weak point of this movie would be Keanu Reeves, since he's not the best actor in town. But instead it was the monotony of the killing, on and on, all at the same pace, with hardly a break.I'm not complaining about violence here—that's what this kind of revenge movie is all about. Reeves plays a guy who used to be a trained assassin, one of the best, and he has to come out of retirement (you'll see why in the first ten minutes). And he is now after some of the people he once worked for, so they are formidable foes, and cruel.But that's about it. The process of getting even takes up the rest of the movie, and there are the necessary clubs and warehouses, the muscle car antics and the flipping and diving while shooting your guns with perfect accuracy. Mostly there is just shooting and fighting and fighting and shooting. So, how to make a movie that has this one-liner idea work? With psychology, cleverness, surprise, and even failure sometimes. You won't see any of that here. You also won't see humor. By luck, the preview for my showing (in a theater) was 'Die Hard,' and what a reminder of a terrific action movie, where one guy has to kill a whole slew of enemies. But there it's funny, there are constant twists and turns, and you actually care about the hero.That's another problem here: you care about Mr. Wick because he was wronged at the start, but he's not a sympathetic person. You just don't really worry about him. I suppose you know he won't die right away, so you are 'on his side' more or less, but not with much investment. In a weird way, some of the villains were more compelling than Wick—the main bad guy is a terrific Michael Nyqvist (who is always really good), and Willem Dafoe plays a terrific small, key part.I might have left a movie this straight forward if it weren't for one thing—it's photographed well. The camera, light, and generally the editing, are all elegant and almost pretty, in a good way. The sets are filmed in a logical way that moves you through the spaces through the eye of the camera with confidence and dark beauty. Good stuff, and it had my eyes glued.Now give the thing something more and glue the rest of me.",6,11,32,24 November 2014
Chinatown," Prettied up, lots of familiar twists, but well done, surely, and with Nicholson in top top form
","Chinatown (1974)Not so much a film noir in style or character, but a period crime drama, set in the familiar 1930s of many noir films, and featuring a noir fixture, the loner detective.I say this right away because Chinatown is sometimes called the last great film noir. After this point, noir films (or pseudo-noir, whatever your definition) become either thoroughly modern or openly derivative. The term 'film noir' has itself loosened up to include almost any moody 1940s-style film with crime in it, which starts lose it's descriptive usefulness.But Jack Nicholson is, really, a great detective in the Raymond Chandler mode--sassy, fearless on the surface but actually wary and a little scared in the end, playing by his own set of rules, and working mostly alone. As well made as this movie is in many ways, it's Nicholson's physical presence that makes his scenes really work. He's such a natural actor for the camera, hesitating just long enough to demand attention but not so long it becomes affected, he becomes definitive. And that's enough to make Chinatown classic.The plot, too, is great dramatic stuff. Based in L.A., with lots of night scenes and period interiors, it circles around pretty women and rich men and corrupt politicos and dubious cops. And around water. In a way, this makes the movie prescient, almost--water being no new topic for Los Angeles but increasingly pertinent in the 1970s. Water is also a MacGuffin in the plot, a device we don't care deeply about compared to the interpersonal intrigues, the incest, the murders. All this other stuff keeps the movie, and Nicholson, going, and it's snappy and well done. It isn't exactly brilliant, though, and anyone really looking at the screenplay and following the plot might raise an eyebrow now and then, or question some of the hyperbole around the movie.It's fun seeing director Roman Polanski appear as a jerky, power-hungry kind of thug, because maybe it fits him (though his friends say otherwise). He has confessed to raping of a young teenager long ago, but I have never heard of him actually apologizing for it. (I know that's supposed to stay outside of the analysis of the movie, and he did do 42 days in jail.) Digging further in, you can maybe see John Huston's role as a little strained (though I love Huston in general, and his presence is meant to let us connect to a previous generation of Hollywood) and Faye Dunawaye, for all her fame, is slightly cold at times, a little decorative. The movie has lots of strong effects this way, and you know that Polanski is a movie lover, and the result taken whole is a kind of bowing down to this kind of crime film from earlier on. And in that sense, every doubt I have for the movie above could be countered with a simple, 'It was intended that way.' And the clichés and familiar plot twists are part of an homage to the medium.Which then begs the question--why isn't it filmed with more energy, with less prettiness? It doesn't in fact, adapt to a rigorous, stark, shadowy film noir aesthetic, but instead layers a very well done but slightly 1970s perfect, technically excellent color. Not that it should have been black and white, and not that Farewell My Lovely (filmed the next year in a really vivid, visual, film noir style in color, in L.A.) is the only way to go. But there were options to avoid making it actually too pretty, and too tame.All of this is relative nitpicking. I go back to Nicholson. If you can focus on his role, his lines, his performance, capital P, you will be mesmerized and impressed, again and again. It is a strong movie, and an interesting one, which is a lot.",7,14,27,15 February 2010
Gravity," A stellar space film that is literally about space and vertigo and survival--fiction, but not science fiction
","Gravity (2013)A ridiculously visual movie. The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.The idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, 'Children without Men.' And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of 'effects' if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.Sandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.Once you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.The answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid 'Grey.' No distractions here.Except the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.The photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. The best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. There have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. It's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.a postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film 'Aningaaq' which is recently posted all over. Google it.",8,77,125,19 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Pure intensity, action, death, and bravery
","Lone Survivor (2013)A more-or-less accurate depiction of four highly capable SEAL soldiers dropped into enemy territory in Afghanistan. They were then discovered and attacked by dozens of area Taliban. The recreation is riveting, disturbing in its intensity, and eye-opening. Whatever you feel about the war there, or even about soldiers killing other soldiers, you end up admiring the sheer abilities of these fit, smart, determined men.And only one survives (this is told in the title). So you go into it knowing it will end badly, and also that one of them (probably Mark Wahlberg, the biggest name here) will make it. If the fighting, which makes up most of the movie in the center core of it, is seemingly endless, that's part of the point. But when it shifts to a local village near the end the tale has another kind of intensity, and a welcome change.This is straight up action material. It lacks even the layers that other movies with similar settings add (see 'The Hurt Locker' for one example). But in a way that makes this distinctive. It moves in linear fashion through time, through the events, and so you barrel along without mental complication to the end. It forces everything on the action, and the realistic portrayal of the unbelievable hardship and pain, and death, that comes along the way.Check out the overly-long Wikipedia page on this movie for lots of facts about production, and about the liberties they took with the facts. Or just watch the movie knowing that there are the usual permitted changes that dramatization requires. Even as pure fiction the movie has enough kinetic and heroic acts to succeed on its own terms.",7,39,55,22 October 2014
Wind River," The last third makes the first third completely worth it.
","Wind River (2017)The setting here will suck you in immediately-remote Wyoming, high mountains and rough uncouth men and a handful of principled good people to keep it steady. The leading man, Jeremy Renner, is superb. He plays Cory, who is strong, thoughtful, but not over the top into cliche, a fish and wildlife mountain man, of sorts. His job is to kill predators like wolves and mountain lions that are intruding on civilization. (This alone sets a one that is filled with contradictions.)
But then a murder happens (of a human being) and things get intertwined with Indians on the Rez and with an FBI agent sent to deal with the conflicint authorities (fed land, local cops, Indian land, etc.). This will seem like a huge weak point because the FBI agent comes off as a terrible stereotype we should all scream against-the incompetent blonde woman over her head. Elizabeth Olsen, unfortunately, is not even quite good at projecting that stereotype.
It somehow survives this stumble, however, and if you get past that half hour of the agent and the hero coming to work together (without any sense of impending romance, by the way), the movie grows and gets more subtle. And as Renner gets more convincing and intense, so does Olsen, as she gets roughed up emotionally and isn't as green or arrogant as she first appears when rolling up her window in the car (you'll see).
Then, to my surprise, the movie turns into a great movie. The last half hour adds lots of nuance even as it gets violent and ugly. It becomes a moving tale of resolution, dreams, mourning, the passing of tradition, the debauchery of lonely men, and the strength within some of us. Yes, maybe I overstate, but it's all there, in pieces.
A warning, perhaps. There are two violent scenes near the end. One is with guns and is quite exciting, for that kind of good guy/bad guy stuff. The other is an assault (which is implied at the very beginning) that is painful and for me not quite necessary. I see why they included it, but it could have been implied instead, or deflected a little. But for people who might find this disturbing-it is.
Expect a well made movie that builds and justifies itself by the end.",7,0,0,19 November 2018
The Death of Stalin," Absurdist great fun
","The Death of StalinThis is not a bit politically incorrect-in fact, the thing that drives this movie is the understanding (and belief) that Stalin was terrible, that his cronies were terrible, and that it's all no joking matter. So what better subject for satire?
And for the first half hour, this rolicks! It doesn't sustain belly laughs all through (the second half gets more chaotic and starts to wear thin) but it is hilarious in some many parts you can't help appreciating it. The writing and acting combine to make a sharp, smart, enjoyable romp.
What about the millions of younger viewers who don't know a twig about Stalin? I think the absurdist humor will still work, if there is at least the basic sense of a bad man surrounded by power hungry graspers.
A lot has been said about Steve Buscemi's great performance-and it's great, surely-but there are several actors who really come forward. And who combine to make a band of horrible misfits. Simon Russell Beale is great as the smart insider, Beria, and Jeffrey Tambor is also great in his caricatured excess (this movie is before his fall from grace). Smaller parts grow in importance, like Olga Kurylenko's blazing strength as Maria, and Rubert Friend and Andrea Riseborough as Stalin's unpredictable son and wild daughter.
The director, Armando Iannucci, is one of my favorites for this kind of smart, fast humor (he directed 'In the Loop' which I love). The writing isn't afraid to step on toes or be inappropriate, which is part of what makes it funny.
You can ask, I suppose, whether the movie makes any sense in aligning the history or making us see Stalin (and 1953) any differently. But who cares? The result is a funny movie that uses an historical moment as a silly launching point. That's all.",7,1,1,7 January 2019
Meet the Parents," Neither brilliant nor timeless, but still really funny and an endless series of mishaps
","Meet the Parents (2000)A clash of family cultures. Ben Stiller plays a really nice guy, really normal nice guy who is about to meet the family of his fiancée (played by Teri Polo). And this family is plain old weird, especially with Robert Deniro playing an ex-CIA dad with a lot of house rules.You might not have heard of the Fockers movies ('Meet he Fockers') but this is the first of them, and the best (even though it's fun to seen Dustin Hoffman show up in the second one). Already this is star-studded. Next to Deniro is Blythe Danner as the mom, and eventually Owen Wilson shows up.What do you get? A romantic comedy which ends up being a series of set up gags and one-liners. It's funny, maybe even hilarious if you're in the mood. And it is what it is, pure silly entertainment. It worked for me only so far. I think I was at first surprised at how subtle Stiller's acting was. But eventually it becomes one absurdity after another.Which is the nature of these kinds of comedies. If you like the cast, go for it!",6,2,5,14 June 2012
I'm Not There," In a Dylanesque surrealism, his character broken and reassembled with flawed brilliance
","I'm Not There (2007)So startling in its invention, so beautiful and stunning the photography and acting, and so appropriate for its subject, Bob Dylan, why does it not quite hold water?Don't get me wrong, I love the movie, the music, and Cate Blanchett equally. It has an extraordinary logic to its many many parts, as well, making not only a fanciful (downright surreal) patchwork of a movie, but a reasonable commentary on the true life Dylan. I could and will watch it again.If you don't know much about Bob Dylan, or don't like his music, I have to say the odds are against you here. If there ever was a movie filled with references (many of them highly symbolic and distant, veiled even), this is it. Even if you like Dylan you might find it hard to follow, so you need to enjoy just sitting back and going for the ride. I'm not sure getting stoned first would help in this case because it's so disorienting at times.Advice for the uninitiated? Read a quick bio of Dylan (Wikipedia might work) and get a sense of at least these core moments: 1) he visited Woody Guthrie on his death bed and was playing folk songs in a traditional vein, 2) he modernized when he moved to the Village, still keeping the folk sound with edgy new lyrics (and this is when he met Joan Baez), 3) he shocked everyone when he went electric at a folk festival (actually at Newport), 4) he was in a near fatal motorcycle accident in 1966 5) he took on a cowboy persona for his 1967 album, John Wesley Harding. That should help with some orientation for the different characters and scenes.For those who are right for the film, including no doubt the director Todd Haynes, who got Dylan's approval for the project ahead of time, this will be a memorable experience.",7,6,10,30 April 2010
Fight Club," In this other world, everything is not at all otherworldly, but darkly starkly breathtaking...
","Fight Club (1999)Such an inventive, twisting, intelligent, seamless movie you'll rarely rarely find. If you want logic or sunshine, forget about it. If you don't mind diving down, getting lost, gasping, and shaking your head in appreciative amazement, this is your movie. Any number of things could go wrong when you have so much depending on the two main male characters each presenting a psychology meant to be a yin and yang pairing, but nothing goes wrong here. Brad Pitt is confident, virile, beautiful in every way that Edward Norton is not. When they meet, so to speak, Norton is transformed, and the wild events that follow seem vaguely possible, even if patently impossible. It's a crazy ride and a beautiful one, dark and funny, and even a little romantic (the woman sidekick is played to perfection by Helena Bonham Carter). Chuck Palahniuk's novel is the basis for all this inventive insanity, and you give director David Fincher credit for even thinking it was filmable. It was a huge effort in every way--assembling the cast, arranging all the special effects, creating the dark and drained color palette, working in the spasmodic soundtrack (effects and music both), on and on. Not to mention just editing it so that it made sense. Which it does. Fincher is a music video director at heart, and that feel is not lost here, to his benefit (the two other films of his I've seen are also visually athletic, the archetypally atmospheric Se7en and the more straight up Panic Room).Fight Club has to be seen for what it is. When I first saw it a year ago, finally, it struck me as trying too hard, and a little outlandish, I mean, it's all so improbable, life on steroids and with sunglasses on in the dark. But this time all this craziness was exactly right, and within the film, within the rules of this special universe inside the film itself, it isn't crazy at all, but convincing and gut level perfect. Step away and don't look back. Perfect stuff.",10,2,7,24 April 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Larger than life in the best cinematic ways
","Inglourious Basterds (2009)We all know by now that Quentin Tarantino is in love with the movies, so it's no surprise that much of this film centers are around an astonishing movie theater. But his love of movies also shows in the way he works with classic ideas and great visual strategies that come from decades of the best of Hollywood. The very first scene is like a remake from some classic Western--John Ford or Sergio Leone, take your pick--with the isolated family seeing trouble coming in, ever so gradually, from the far distance.And then trouble arrives, and it unfolds here like a croissant in the morning sun, steam slowly rising into the French Provincial air. This, you'll see, or you know already, is film-making at its best, old-school or new-school, it doesn't matter. The suspense, the elegant and fluid camera-work, the astonishing writing and even more astonishing delivery by the two men at this very first juncture, playing a kind of 'I know what you are thinking' kind of game, all drawn out in a breathtaking, poetic, nerve-wracking way.Then all hell breaks loose. This is the other side of Tarantino, the violent violence, where the blood is too red and too balletic to be real. I don't have the ability to step out of this kind of on screen gore and so it shocks me every time, and it seems like the movie might work just as well (or better) with implied violence, rather than splattering it in your face. But this director, I think, sees all of it from a director's point of view--that everything is artifice, including the preceding scene with the two men, where I, for one, was impressed partly by believing it, by being completely sucked in. Which makes the offputting violence that follows all the more upending.I have no doubt it is this push-pull effect that makes all of Tarantino's films have that energy few others can match. In this case, there is a lot of plain old fun built into seeing the bad guys get what they deserve (I felt a weird pleasure, which I confess and which I don't understand, in seeing one very particular bad guy shot to pieces near the end), and a lot of suspense as you root for the unlikely heroes. The archetypes, like Brad Pitt's good bad guy role with a Kentucky accent (better than your Italian, Brad), and the more original characters, like the young woman who owns the theater and is truly trapped by circumstances, equally make their scenes larger than life. In fact, Inglourious Basterds is pure Hollywood in the way it makes everything on the screen larger than life. Isn't that what the golden age of Hollywood was all about? Yes. And it is exactly what some directors like Tarantino are still bent on pulling off. A great film. Whatever the problems and the gore, this strikes me as a perfect film the way Fargo is perfect, or Reservoir Dogs. Tastes aside, you have to see it.",9,24,50,8 September 2009
World War Z," For originality and finesse it fails, but it's fast, furious, and Brad Pitt makes it gel
","World War Z (2013)In short: another formula disaster film. Well made, some great acting (and some not so great), and some good scary scenes, and maybe that's enough. It is, after all, a summer movie.But it could have been different. Having the zombies sprint and have superhuman resistance to getting hurt makes for exciting scenes of mass chaos and running and running. It speeds up the normal dread and fear of the classic Romero style zombies. But it also makes the whole thing kind of just a sensation, and it borders on silly, or it would if so many people weren't getting killed and zombified.The whole movie is about excess, everything speeded up and boiling down to confrontation and decision on the spot. There is almost zero expectation or suspense. In fact, one of the clearly best scenes in the movie comes near the end when Brad Pitt (who is great throughout) has a one-on-one with a zombie through a glass door. It takes time, it has the audience wondering. It isn't just about shock and reaction to shock, but about anticipating shock. And then, yes, you don't always need the shock.Pitt's wife in this is a bore and it's not really her fault. She is given the role of being a good wife and protecting their children, which she does. The only woman with substance is a little known Israeli woman (actress Daniella Kertesz) and even she becomes someone Pitt has to save. Which he does. With style and a little out there medical treatment (I mean before they get on the plane!). Ha. The movie is really quite fun and fast and zippy. If it's obvious and superficial, maybe I expect too much.But wait, aren't there other movies that go here and do better at making it work on several levels? Like 'Children of Men' which has a similar futuristic chaotic vision and yet lots of novel turns and much more amazing filming. 'World War Z' is not filmed badly by any means, but it depends a lot on fast cuts (and multiple cuts) which create that barrage effect rather than a more coherent following the action through the disaster, which works better for the viewer. And then there is the issue of plausibility. I know, who cares? Well, on some level it changes how you take the movie. If it is just comic book stuff, and the superhero can do anything, then whatever, sure (though even superheroes have rules of play). But for example they realize at some point a way to work around the way the zombies attack anyone living so quickly, and yet don't explain or suggest at all how the zombies would know one kind of victim from another. (I'm trying not to give anything away.) They just 'know' and this becomes a chink in their armor.I don't know. I found it frustrating just as much as fun. I saw it in 3-D and that was dispensable, I think. I mean--it's a novelty, but the movie doesn't really need it. There's plenty of depth, and action, and visual complexity, without it. Save the three bucks unless you're a devotee.Thanks Brad Pitt for holding this all together. He dominates every scene, and for good reason. And look at the original book, which has a lot of differences (like no main character) and a unique construction (as a U.N. official document). This is an adaptation, and it borrows from the clichés with heavy-handed dependability.",6,6,11,1 July 2013
The Hunger Games," Fabulous scenario, adventurous filming, the best of it makes the rest of it really good!
","The Hunger Games (2012)Well, with a sequel already planned you know there is some kind of hook and success here. It's a chilling idea doled out with high drama and great campiness: in the future, a televised ritual annually pits teenagers in a fight to the death as a kind of protection against war. The brutality and primal cheering of the masses bring to mind the Roman matches to the death in the Colosseum. And the superstitions implied (that such a thing would actually work) made me think of the story (and movie) by Shirley Jackson, 'The Lottery.'The main character is a young woman already equipped with survival skills. She is the female representative from District 12, and in all there are 24 combatants, a male and a female from each of the dozen districts. Yes, it's eventually a bloody awful affair. In fact, the first half of the movie, before the battles, is the best. It introduces the whole idea, including the pomp and circumstance, the game show atmosphere, and behind-the-scenes primping and strategizing. Stanley Tucci is the host of the show, the Hunger Games as they are called, and he's wonderfully nutty. Woody Harrelson is a jaded and unconventional tutor (and former games winner) for the District 12 pair. And Lenny Kravitz plays an attractive smart stage manager and morale booster.Dominating in every way is Jennifer Lawrence, who is a good reluctant strong participant. How long she survives you'll have to see for yourself--that's part of the game--but it's how she survives that matters, and how she becomes the target of some of the other 'tributes' (as they are called, since the youngsters are bloody sacrifices for peace, ultimately). The scenario is great stuff, the sets and filming and pace of it really first rate. In many ways it's a terrific movie, and it's making billions at the box office for good reasons.The second half of the film is the grand battle. It amounts mostly a series of encounters between various 'tributes,' a dwindling number of course. Members of the television audience worldwide are cheering for their own districts to win, and cameras seem to be everywhere. In fact, the control room of the 'world' makes clear it's a lot like 'The Truman Show' with complete mastery over the elements, the sun, and even invented fires and other threats. (It was all filmed in North Carolina, by the way.)If you like logic to your ritual barbarism, you'll have to look the other way now and then. Our heroine is singled out for some extra terrors, a bit unfairly, and then avoids other sure death situations by inexplicable kindness or little goodies floated in on metal parachutes. And those ultra-lethal genetically modified wasps? They don't live up to their billing. And why do some giant dog cyber-beasts suddenly attack our heroes and not anyone else?Nitpicking? Only maybe. There were some avoidable gaffes like this, and it's the director (Gary Ross) who is also the writer who needs to shoulder a little blame there. Or can we eventually attribute some of the limitations here to the young adult novel that forms the basis to it all. There is some background buzz about the movie because of supposed racist and feminist issues one way or another, and I think there is room for argument there because the 'types' used in the movie are in fact stereotypes. Some small effort at surprising the audience with better casting would have avoided the criticism and made a better movie. (The wikipedia entry for this movie is stunningly long. Check it out.)In some ways this is nearly a 10 star movie. It's that good. But it's really too long overall, especially the second half which revels in some pretty basic hunt and kill violence. And there are some cracks in the veneer that drag the whole thing down to simply a fun, inventive, interesting futurist drama. That's good enough.",7,3,8,1 June 2012
12 Monkeys," Dystopia gone Monty Python? Yes, half way.
","Twelve Monkeys (1995)The best parts of this movie are so farcical, horrifying, inventive, or lyrical, it's hard to swallow the worst parts, which are unbelievable when belief is required, and sentimental when sentiment is cheap.You can see a Monty Python influence in director Terry Gilliam's style, or vision, in parts of the movie, and in other parts it more hard edge dystopia. Both work well. The lead actors (Brad Pitt in a twitchy role and Bruce Willis in a confused tough guy role) are right on, and they make the movie have heart where it might have just been a great production designer's extravaganza. Lead female Madeleine Stowe plays the slightly too-cocky psychiatrist well, getting in the middle of an awful lot of madness.The movie is terrifying in its vision of a hellish, dark, poisoned future, and yet it's comic and silly enough to not be a downer movie. The overtly clever main scene which is shown to us with a little too much cinematic control (we sense a movie trick of editing, and slow-mo, right off the bat) is key to the plot, but sort of a thin bit of the larger plot. But following the main characters through their race against time, almost literally, is totally absorbing. There are many scenes to remember, and the whole experience is just tongue-in-cheek enough to forgive the movie makers their glitches and foibles.Watch it. It's a great ride.",8,1,2,26 May 2010
Mississippi Burning," Powerful and necessary telling of a tale most of us already know
","Mississippi Burning (1988)A powerful movie with a handful of first rate actors and a story of injustice that gets worse and worse. Gene Hackman leads the stellar performances-he's phenomenal-with Willem Dafoe and a young Frances McDormand supporting him beautifully.
I don't think the plot is exactly what moves this story along, but rather the overall theme. In fact, the brutal, ignorant racism that underlies the motives of the Mississippi men in the movie is a kind of given for the 1960s (and unfortunately, in some quarters, to this day). The FBI swooping down on this town is not quite the admirable sight it should be, and that's to the credit of the moviemakers. Large institutional law enforcement was necessary to break the local politics (and morality) there, but it comes off as heavy handed and insensitive.
And that's where Hackman thrives, being the loner amidst the crowd, doing the dirty work necessary and that ends up being heroic in the end.
The filming (and all the fires suggested by the title) make for a vigorous movie to watch. It's a good, classic telling of a well known tale. And I hint at what makes the movie a little limited-it is telling a story we all kind of know, that there were a lot of truly hateful white people inflicting harm and violence onf black people in the deep South. I wish it had found a way to make it more distinctive. Maybe for those who don't really know all this happened, it's a big bang way to find out, but if you already have the gist of it in your head, this will travel some familiar ground.
It tells its story so well, however, it's still a great watch. So watch.",8,2,3,19 January 2019
Au Revoir les Enfants," The subtle and not subtle anti-Semitism through the eyes of a French boys boarding school
","Au Revoir Les Enfants (1987)A wrenching, sensitive, all-too-true drama set in a gorgeous French wooded outpost during World War II. The main actors are boys, and they play their parts with unusual conviction, unexaggerated but with intensity. And the anti-Semitism that arises, though inevitable in Nazi territory, comes subtly and really stings. The movie isn't complete without this horror, but the horror is made complete by the really vivid recreation of this kind of private boys school--a period movie at its best.Director Louis Malle has not only a message, but a sensitive feel for the medium--for making fluid the flow and background of the plots of his films. It's also a fairly complex mix of types, and you can somehow keep them all straight as it goes--as straight as you are meant to as the facts unfold. In the end, it confirms a familiar story of Nazi terror, but one that can't be told too often.",9,5,5,17 January 2010
The Impossible," Brilliant depiction of a huge catastrophe--but the plot is linear and limited
","The Impossible (2012)I'll start by explaining the big basics: this is extremely well done, but it only does what the facts tell it to do.So, it's amazing. It shows the effects of the epic 2004 tsunami on a group of British tourists. It shows the unexpected before scenes (life is gorgeous, nothing will intrude) and it shows the flooding huge wash of ocean itself (the rush of destruction). In a way, that's enough for a great movie right there. Maybe the before stuff is generic—rich Europeans enjoying Thailand for its beauty and beachfront motel. Great. But the incoming waters and their pure terror are presented beautifully, incredibly. It's not just the spectacular crash of the wave on the upscale motel and palm trees, but the many minutes (it seems like hours) afterwards as our heroes get pushed inland with all the debris. It's quite astonishing, and for this alone I think the movie is worth the time—at the very least.There is another half of the movie that is about the core family trying to find all its members, one of whom is trying to simply stay alive in the makeshift hospital amidst all the other victims. This part of the movie is also well done, and very believable. Someone has taken the time to get the facts more or less correct. If you watch this you will be there. You'll understand at least what a rich foreigner might have experienced in the disaster.However (and you knew a however was coming, I hope): that's all there is. Yes, you might think it's enough. All the heartbreak and celebration all the struggle for meaning and life and family, keeping sanity and the basics of food and heartbeat, all of this seems like it's self-sufficient. But really, as a movie, as a development and investigation into character and meaning, I'm not seeing what it boils down to.For lovers of the movie this will seem petty, I'm sure. But really, as a piece, as a work of 'art' or 'moviemaking' or whatever we expect from a film, it does often seem like a simple portrayal of a disaster. It's not that we don't empathize—I was in the grip of the problem for the main two actors. It's more that it's really not quite enough for a cinematic project. It's almost like a docudrama, a re-enactment. Well done, but that's as far as it goes.To put it another way, if you like documentaries, and you have some feeling for the colossal tragedy of the earthquake and tsunami, you might like this purely and simply. If you want a movie-like development and some kind of moral and narrative complexity, this isn't quite up to snuff. Which leaves it in your hands. See it, for sure. But in perspective.",7,2,5,13 November 2013
42," Good intentions, great true story, bland and glossy to the point of insulting
","42 (2013)This is a ten star, top notch dramatic story and a four star, disappointing delivery. No, the acting isn't terrible, and in fact the filming and editing are up to normal professional levels. But that's not what makes a good movie—not alone. This is more like Disney does the Jackie Robinson Story. Oh—does that sound familiar? Yes, there is a movie called 'The Jackie Robinson Story' and it stars, believe it or not, Jackie Robinson, who was not an actor and in fact couldn't hold up his end of his own story. That movie, too, falls under the bus of righteous storytelling.But of course the story IS fantastic. And important and dramatic. It needs a less fearful approach than '42' for sure. The attempts at showing his relationship with his wife are too long and generic, there is no showing of his amazing rise through the Negro leagues, there is nothing about his psychology, even—not beyond the anger and torment that are obvious. And you know full well there are good, respectable depths available (and written about) that need to see the light of day.Most of all there is only the expected here. There is blatant racism (some of it really terrible) and there is hero worship. And all of this is told in a glossy, bland way. There's even the required slow motion as Robinson rounds the bases after a key home run. Bravo, movie makers. Nice thinking!Ugh. It figures the director AND writer is someone like Brian Helgeland, with little feature directing experience (just 'Payback,' which is however quite good). Bravo for Harrison Ford for taking on a good role and anchoring the whole thing a little.Okay, so maybe you like feel good movies. Why not? See it. I have to admit I liked the story enough I stuck it out. I wanted to experience the events through the movie. And you can do that here. Maybe that's enough. For me it was not, and for me even further it's a shame. It doesn't put racism under the thumb enough, it doesn't make Robinson's heroic actions clear enough, it doesn't show the trap of money and necessity enough, and it doesn't even make the game of baseball as interesting as it really is. Enough.",6,13,18,11 March 2014
Shaun of the Dead," Great concept, subtle twists, a bit drawn out at times, but a classic, for sure
","Shaun of the Dead (2004)Clearly ridiculous, and clearly funny. For some it doesn't get much more comic and hilarious, both exaggerated and subtle (actually). By luck (good or bad) I have seen several British movies with the same comic team (the same actors, namely Simon Pegg, but also some background people like director Edgar Wright) and there are more similarities in the plots and funny moments than you might expect. Which means fewer 'original' laughs. The main culprit is 'The World's End,' which is also a good time, but there is the pub at the center of things, and the zombie/androids in both, and a feeling of friends helping friends fight the evils. It's funny once, but be careful twice. (Or, I'm sure, if you think one movie is stellar, you'll possibly love the other.) These two, and another called 'Hot Fuzz' which I haven't seen, are officially a 'trilogy' and so are naturally overlapping. Such is success.This is the classic, and the first, and has its own reputation that goes beyond just another zombie movie. (See also 'Zombieland' from 2009 which I liked even more, also a spoof.) The funniest aspect of 'Shaun' is the sense of not noticing the zombies, then the kind of normal approach to having a zombie in your yard, or in your house or car. Or finding that your best friend, or mum, is a zombie. Etc. It brings it away from the horror film genre almost completely. Even when there is chaos and near annihilation, there is also a feeling of hilarity. There is always a ray of hope. And there is love, sort of, that constant rescuer in films of all flavors.The zombies are terrific—they stay to what I think of as the necessary Romero styled zombie style, with the rules of walking and acting a certain way (unlike 'World War Z' which was hyped up in that sense). If you worry about zombies entering your world, and want to know what to do, see this one and see of course the very original from the current era, the archetypal 'Night of the Living Dead,' which as some quality of perfection that can't be ignored. Here of course it makes fun but it does so in a way that says it's all for real, too.See it!",7,2,5,15 September 2014
Argo," Sparkling rah-rah go-get-em action adventure done to technical high standards.
","Argo (2012)The preview for 'Argo' made me think of a dozen recent political thrillers, and the clichés lined up in my mind to the point I didn't want to see it. Then it won the Golden Globe, and I'm thinking there must be more to this than meets the eye. I wrote this review at first with the rush of having seen a really well made political thriller, but the blush has faded and I'm revising down a hair. It's good, but it really is formula movie making in some ways. And yet, in other ways, it's fast and fresh and funny.The first minute, the first ten minutes, are so riveting you can forget any doubts about the previews. In some ways this sets an unmatchable pace for the rest, outlining the history leading to the hostage crisis in Iran that is the crux of the plot later on. Mixing found footage (or what looks like real period stuff) with new shots, and editing in a whirlwind that will, even when it calms down, make your head spin, the pace and the energy is great. Gradually it becomes clear what particular focus the movie will take--the six embassy workers who avoided being taken hostage in the crisis (this is late 1979).When the plot broadens to include not only the Canadian Ambassador's house but a bunch of small time Hollywood professionals (played by big time Hollywood professionals named Alan Arkin and John Goodman), the fun begins. And as much as the movie is painful and gut-wrenching, it's actually fun, and in Goodman's case, downright hilarious. It's that famously classic mix of tragic and comic that makes the movie click. It's a bit glib and maybe even dumbed down, at times, but it still gets some sincere laughs.Ben Affleck directed and stars as the leading operative who tries to get the six out of Iran using a crazy concoction of chutzpah and genius. Whether it works you'll see. But the movie is filmed, and edited, with unusual clarity and intelligence. It's not just fast, it's kinetic and logical and irresistible. It's an artistic job of putting several plot lines together into one dynamic energized whole. It creates a really stupidly Hollywood fantasy of an ending (the airport stuff) that isn't true, and the personal life of Affleck's character is further sentimentalizing (also not true--check wikipedia). The only downside to the movie is that it is what it is--it's history, it has no surprises if you know the history, and it's laden slightly with the feeling the 'we' are the good guys and 'they' are not. And it's a conventional--though highly effective--action adventure political thriller beat the clock movie. I mean, there are ways these movies are put together and this follows the rules. I don't know if the Iranians are presented fairly, overall, but an Iranian student of mine (born and raised in Tehran) said it looked really authentic to him. It is, however, an very pro-American view of things, for better or worse.In the end 'Argo' is just so smartly made and paced, you'll get sucked in. Guaranteed.",7,1,2,27 January 2013
Last Flag Flying," A great ensemble piece with meaning
","Last Flag Flying (2017) A great, low-key mixture of comedy and sadness. The more it went on the more I appreciated the situation, which unfolds like a play, and the ensemble acting, which is sharp. Bryan Cranston steals the show as the outgoing practical bartender veteran, but Laurence Fishburne and Steve Carell are really spot on, too, in deliberately restrained ways.
 The film is trying to get to something here. At first it seems to be about some guys coming to terms with their time in Viet Nam, and how it compromised them then, with repurcussions ever onward. Then a slow critique of war and of the US approach to war, pretending everyone in uniform is always a hero, and fighting for questionable (or worse) causes. 
 But an important third element grows-the actual meaning these men have for each other. They hadn't seen each other in decades, but their comraderie was almost unbroken because of some deep bond formed in wartime. And when it really comes down to it, even as they reject and hate the government for what they were forced to do, they still understood honor and respect.
 Including a love of country, somehow. That it's there, despite the flaws. Or something like that. (There are complications, and it would be easy and shameful to oversimplify.)
 The big point is: see this and give it time to settle in and warm up. The three men are deliberately an odd mix, and there are a couple of scenes that are rather too neatly contrived to make a fast point in the narrative, but overall it makes sense and is moving.",8,3,6,1 August 2018
12 Angry Men," Compact, vivid, progressive--not a civics lesson, but a study of human nature
","12 Angry Men (1957)What makes a movie shot almost entirely in a single room so compelling? It isn't the built-in civics lesson, even though it does make you glad for the jury system. Even more than the apparent plot about twelve men and their deliberations about a crime, there is a plot about human nature. The men are all etched just enough to become types--not stereotypes in a bad sense, miraculously, but kinds of people we recognize. And with amazing economy, the strengths and flaws of those kinds of people, simplified too much for reality but compressed just perfectly for the movies, become the guts of this play of passion.It doesn't hurt that the editing is supremely crisp, the continuity is spot-on, and the casting is brilliant, if color-blind (see below). It also doesn't hurt one bit that the cinematography by Boris Kaufman (see On the Waterfront), is that really clear, dramatic black and white photography of post-noir 1950s. It's beautiful and startling, showing at times the interactions of the group in the room as a whole in a kind of walking ballet, and at other times close-ups of hot faces straining to come to terms with the other eleven people in the room. In other words, this is a technically virtuosic ensemble piece, cast and crew, top to bottom.As viewers, it is this coming to understand people that makes us part of the scenario. We might see ourselves or our friends in these people, but even if they are strangers, if they seem a full half-century away from our own types, they are still people we are curious about. Sitting on a jury, being locked together in a room, and having to decide about the execution of the accused, all of this makes you grapple with personalities and motives quickly. There is not getting around deciding--both on the verdict, of course, but also on what kind of men are in the room. Why are they voting one way or the other? What makes them stubborn, or wise, or clever? Or funny, annoying, selfish?The all white male jury is potentially a problem. It should have been a problem back then, when planning the movie, and it becomes one now because the movie represents history, whether or not it likes it. After the Civil War (by amending the Constitution, and with a Civil Rights Act in 1875) it was illegal to exclude blacks from juries, and this was tested in court many times (often in the South). New York City could easily end up with an all white jury (and downtown Manhattan it isn't unlikely) but it is surely conspicuous for a movie trying to represent the sweep of humanity in a single room. Likewise with women, who by the 1930s were regularly part of New York City juries. In the 1950s, white men might have been more clearly enrolled on the lists used to select jurors (such as voting lists), so again, an all-male white jury isn't so unlikely, just conspicuous.Having said all that, I think the movie works partly because on some simple level, the jurors are all the same! To have made them more clearly diverse would have changed the way we saw them get to know each other. Having one guy be from a 'slum' and know about knives is revealed slowly, and we can't really outwardly distinguish that man from any other. Even the one clear immigrant has assimilated. So 12 Angry Men isn't an accurate capsule or a documentary exercise, but a study in types and countertypes, reactions and resistance to action.Director Sidney Lumet cut his teeth for a decade with early t.v. and when he ventured into movies (this was his first success) he did so with a visual reaction against the flatness and static cameras of much of that medium, back then especially. He and Fonda worked together notably in Fail-Safe, another politically charged drama in black and white (and one where Fonda is again trapped in a small room). And later, in Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico (both starring a young and amazing Al Pacino) he again uses a highly charged external problem to deal with psychological responses that are even more intense. I want to live long enough to see this movie in 2057, just to see if it holds water once that period is looking quaint and distant (the way 1909 does to us from here). Already, as much as this is a fabulous, inspiring, vivid movie, it is also showing its seams, its contrivance, and its agenda too clearly. For now it's a concise dramatic masterpiece.",9,2,3,26 September 2009
The English Patient," A highly romantic, layered, dramatic, beautiful experience...sometimes in excess?
","The English Patient (1996)This pulls out every high drama romance issue known to men and women in love, and with great sophistication and beauty. It is set in that most dramatic of times, World War II, and in the most gorgeous of places, North Africa dripping in sand and sun, and Italy in the provinces outside of Florence. The leads are sophisticated and beautiful, too, so if you don't fall in love with the scenery, and don't get sucked in by the layered and heart wrenching plot, you'll come to love at least some of the characters, played by actors of substance, with intensity.So what could go wrong? Some will say nothing. It did win seven (seven!) Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director (for the richly talented Anthony Minghella). Yet both times I saw it I was not quite absorbed. I don't think it is too long, especially, though it is long. Instead I think it is too perfect, which of course is double talk, to say that the flaw of a movie is that it is too perfect. But you can see, maybe, how a movie is just so poised and fluid and cinematically calculated it starts to feel 'knowing' or somehow aware of its own perfection. Likewise with the plot, screenwritten by Minghella from a novel by Michael Ondaatje, is almost too packed with the worst and best kinds of scenes--abandoned lovers, lovers seeing lovers cheat on them, identities lost, memories told by candlelight, promises made and kept, or not kept, against the most grandiose odds and explosive circumstances. It's amazing stuff, and it begs for honesty, for some cracks in the glass. Too much Tiffany and blood, not enough hesitation and error. Those things make for a different kind of perfection.But then again, this is like finding the flaws in a Hitchcock film. They abound, and they might be interesting, but don't forget the whole, the parts that work, and work you over, and leave you breathless and crying if you let them. The English Patient rises above itself many times. Juliette Binoche is easily the most compelling character in her honesty, and Colin Firth gives a small but charmed performance. Ralph Fiennes is meant to have two different sides to his character (or three, if you include the bed-ridden version), and when he is sparkling and feisty he is alive on the screen. As a brooding, serious man he approaches wooden at times, though some women might disagree. The least known of the four or five main actors, Kristen Scott Thomas, is meant to be exactly what she is--an adventurous and gifted person who everyone likes but who is, at heart, making the most of being away from England, and this unromanticized presence is key. Finally there is Willem Dafoe, who plays that slightly exaggerated, quirky, creepy guy he can do so well.And this of course, just brushes against the iceberg. Like The Talented Mr. Ripley (by the same director), this is a mammoth undertaking, hugely engrossing, but unlike Ripley, this one is at times ironically cold, playing with so many flashbacks its construction starts to intrude. But the movie is still worth seeing for what it pulls off best: high romance, great drama, and another version of true love on the screen.",8,5,8,11 February 2010
Public Enemies," Chutzpah and Brains Gone Bad in a Pretty Good Version
","Public Enemies (2009)Chutzpah and Brains Gone BadYes, this is a terrific gangster film, filled with period effects, great character acting, and visuals to knock the safety off your machine gun. But it's more than that, more than a love story snuck between the bank heists, more than a glimpse at the roots of the FBI (with a slightly unconvincing J. Edgar getting started). It manages to create a pulse and a mood that sustains even the occasional slow moments. It makes the life of Dillinger, in the form of Johnny Depp, a little fantastic and romantic in a filmic way--creating another Hollywood icon. The bio is the vehicle for a larger aura, which is the movie.After all, we know the facts. It's how they are told and how they are seen that matters. Public Enemies, with all its clichés, is dynamic and sweet, disturbing and even a little bit funny. There are redundant moments (one too many bank robberies for me) and some acting that falls a little flat (including, unfortunately, Dillinger's love interest). But the cinematography by Dante Spinotti is really superb and varied, playing with foreground and background, often with a single element shown very close, and using a huge range of interesting light--the long chase scenes in the Wisconsin woods struck me as original and beautiful.So I wouldn't think of this as a film about plot but about getting absorbed, which you can really do well. And about Depp in a superb performance, filled with charm and confidence and unrecognized doom.",7,4,6,26 July 2009
Us," A decent, but run of the mill scare movie with a couple of improbable twists..
","Us (2019)I think if I saw this movie without knowing the director and writer was Jordan Peele, I would have just dismissed it as ordinary stuff. It has all the elements of a kind of zombie twist, with the appealing semi-novelty of featuring a black cast in a normalizing way. That's all fine.
But this is a movie built on clichés, and with an awful lot of chasing, hiding, being found, fighting, chasing, hiding, etc. It clicks along fine for awhile, and has an odd twist in the middle. The larger 'twist' at the end is kind of the overall rationale to things and it's so improbable and silly it doesn't work. Sure, suspend your disbelief, but don't call this a great movie.
The elephant in the room is 'Get Out,' which of course is Peele's previous movie, a fabulous bit of moviemaking. But that movie, to be clear, has originality, great acting, true suspense (as opposed to scary surprises), and some overlying meaning about race. And I think the main actor in that one was above and beyond and made the movie rise even higher. 'Us' is none of those things. I almost didn't care to see the end it was so obvious as it went, and kind of playing with the audience's helplessness.
Hopes are up for Peele's next round.",6,0,3,17 July 2019
The Secret in Their Eyes," Quiet, dramatic, beautiful, touching, well acted, gorgeously filmed...what else do you want?
","El secreto des sus ojos (2009)A quietly building up of suspense and romance , a terrific movie. It has some of the slow pace punctuated by violence of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' and it shares the steadfast leading man (Ricardo Darin), willing to plod along until the crime is solved. And it's filmed with a contemporary edgy but warm eye, the camera often moving between things so the subject is half seen, or not seen at all, and yet it is so natural you just get sucked in further.The plot may seem ordinary at a glance, with a pair of investigators, one a very funny alcoholic (Guillermo Francella), going after a man who raped and killed a woman, but it isn't really this main idea that matters at first. In the classic fashion of some great detective movies, it's the characters and how they proceed that matters. We come to know the two men (as well as actress Soledad Villamil, a tangential love interest) and wander through less common edges of Argentina, where this was made.The storytelling is given depth by moving back and forth over a 25 year period, and this laying out of ideas slowly makes you pay attention. It's very smart this way, grabbing the viewer. By the end, the tragedies begin to really move you, the final large twist (or two) to the story is utterly believable and sensational, and the love story becomes as archetypal as 'Dr. Zhivago' and as beautiful. A lovely, involving, and satisfying film.",9,6,7,9 February 2011
Batman Returns," The makings, if not quite the results, of a campy classic
","Batman Returns (1992)I've seen this version of Batman a few times now, over the years, and in many ways it's the best of them all, along with the companion 1989 'Batman.' And in some key ways, both of these fall just short of quite gelling into classics.Here's why, both ways.First, remembering Batman as a comic book hero, Tim Burton's version of that world is wonderfully exaggerated and fanciful and actually comic. This is the biggest difference (in my humble view) with the Nolan films of the last decade. Where Burton sees a chance to be inventive and playful, Nolan sees a chance to make the unbelievable real.It's a relief that there is no reality to Burton's world. Sometimes you can tell the movie was shot on a set—and the same set, rather a lot—but that's again part of the 'world' we are drawn into.Characters for Burton are about excess just beyond camp. The Penguin is pretty amazing—Danny DeVito pulls it off like no one else could, an equal to Jack Nicholson's Joker from Burton's earlier Batman flick. And Catwoman as played by Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific. Batman himself might be a matter of taste—many people prefer Michael Keaton but I find him dull. And in this movie, he mostly stands around as Bruce Wayne and drives around as Batman. Not much physicality here.Christopher Walken? He starts off being weird and wonderful and then kind of keeps that steady state attitude throughout (even as his world is in constant tumult). It works, but it's not perfect. In fact that's what happens a lot of the time. Some of the 'action' sequences aren't as elegantly edited (or shot) as other similar films (especially Nolan's) and so there is energy but not necessarily a visceral involvement. (You have to be thinking about this while watching it, I suppose.)But it's Burton's idea of Gotham, and his development of characters, that makes the movie really special. Whatever its limitations, it has so much that goes beyond expectations—and beyond the somber grandiosity of the Nolan versions—you really need to see it.",7,6,9,15 December 2013
Creed," Good, solid, but by the book inside and out...
","Creed (2015)I went into this expecting too much, for sure, but if you do the same, you'll still be happy to see a solid boxing movie. The clichés are huge, of course, on purpose, including lots of mentions (and movie clips) of the earlier Rocky movies. In that sense, this is a movie for people who loved the original (and to some extent the earlier sequels). It's a feelgood followup without a completely predictable ending. As the son of Apollo Creed (remember him?) turns to boxing instead of a lucrative business career (really?) we have an echo of that first Italian Stallion rising up from nowhere to challenge the best of his times.With no disrespect to the leading actor, Michael B. Jordan, the character lacks the quirky depth and pathos of the original slightly dumb-seeming but ultra sweet role that Stallone created (he wrote it) in 'Rocky.' And so Jordan, the ex-banker, has none of the rising from the depths of poverty and loneliness that the original Rocky had. They try to give him some backstory with lots of fighting as a kid, but it's just story, not emotional depth.And so the rest of the movie follows suit. We like the guy (Adonis Creed) and want him to win. But we like even more Stallone himself, who ends up being once again the start of the movie—and with a large role. He's officially a supporting actor, but he's in it top to bottom and with real depth to his character.Some of what keeps this being a good solid but unexceptional boxing story is the writing (Ryan Coogler) and the directing (Ryan Coogler). The plot and the technicals of directing are all straight from the book—predictable, but professional. The fight scenes themselves are among the best of the movie— emotionally and physically convincing. And watch Stallone all along, who is pretty terrific. Yeah, you might want all these clichés, but heads up—they aren't enough for a truly great movie, which this is sometimes promoted to be.",7,4,6,1 April 2016
Hot Fuzz," Another Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) hilarity
","Hot Fuzz (2007)Coming out of a growing group of British comedies centered on Simon Pegg and a familiar cast, this one takes on small town English sensibilities with typical zaniness. It's a blast. Nerdy London supercop Nicholas Angel is banished to a quaint little village because he's making the London cops look bad. But here he seems unwelcome because he's stirring up trouble—arresting underage drinkers, for example. As mysterious murders begin to accumulate, he sniffs a dastardly conspiracy. With sidekick Nick Frost, something will indeed be done about it.The whole movie is fast and faster, edited with a fury, and in the first ten minutes we get the overachieving nature of our hero and also meet a handful of great British comic forces, including Bill Nighy. But don't get your hopes up—they don't reappear. Still, Pegg and Frost and a host of strong, quirky, smart performers make up the wonderful townspeople, some of them with little comic flourishes that make you laugh out loud. Often.So, yeah, this is comic, for sure, and fast, which means you have to stay on your toes to catch some of the jokes (some plays on words in particular). About two thirds the way through it all, Angel shifts to Clint Eastwood mode (Dirty Harry, that is) and the vigilante cop in all of us (apparently) takes over. At first this is funny, but even a die hard action adventure fan will tire of the endless chasing and shooting and shooting and chasing—it seems to be half an hour. It's not without humor or variety, but in the overall plot, things have come to a halt. Oddly enough.And it ends with a bang. Of course. Enjoyable, yes, and really funny at its best. For any 'Shaun of the Dead' fans (which is the lynchpin of this kind of British humor), this movie is a must.",7,1,1,13 May 2015
The Natural," If you love baseball sentiment, pure storybook nostalgia, you'll love it. Otherwise...
","The Natural (1984)What an outsized reputation this sentimental, sloppy movie has! Even the famous scene with Glenn Close standing up in the stands in the sun is smaller than you'd expect. In fact, if you take this movie as a straight ahead story of a glorious (if fictional) baseball past, it's simplistic and overly sentimental to the point of unwatchable.But it's not straight ahead. It's a fable. It does silly things knowing that they would work in an illustrated children's book, so why not make it a sepia-toned over-the-top feel-good Hollywood bash? Indeed.So when Robert Redford (who does not, by the way, have the biceps for power hitting) smashes a pitch so hard he rips the skin off the ball, it's not for real. Or it's better than real. And so forth with lightning arriving in time for his last big hit, or having his rival crash through a wall and die (yes die!) just when he needs a chance to take position in right field. Treating this as a fable about a man with talent and a dream, and with some kind of sloppy honor to his past (you'll see), makes it very watchable. It's doesn't quite make it 'good' however, so be prepared to like the film only on its own simple terms. It's fun if you don't think too hard. This movie has great credentials, including Barry Levinson directing and Robert Duvall in a secondary role. Honestly, it's just not my kind of film—check out 'The Pride of the Yankees' for a really good baseball film—but I can see how it would settle nicely on a lot of folks, including young people with dreams of being the best.",5,3,6,21 May 2015
The Hustler," Poolhall scamming and psychology, with Newman, Gleason, Scott, and yes, Piper Laurie!
","The Hustler (1961)An archetypal man's movie in the poolroom. It's about power, and bluffing, and class. It really isn't about pool, or billiards, though there are some great shots by the leads, especially Paul Newman (and some great trick shots, too, not showing who is shooting them for the camera). But it is a little bit about poolrooms and poolroom ethics, and poolroom hustling.Hustling is the art of scamming, and it gets applied to pool in particular because it's a classic place to bluff your way in as a mediocre player and then win big at the end of the night. But as easy as this seems to keep an eye out for, or to avoid by playing your best no matter what, it gets to be a complicated mind game. And a game of plain old violence in the bathroom, where losers win in the end. Sort of.Jackie Gleason plays the great Minnesota Fats and does both of them justice (Gleason is stoic, sharp, and overweight, all important counterpoints to Newman's Fast Eddie). The third player is the ugliest character, the money man behind the players and ruthless, played with more restraint than usual for this actor, George C. Scott. Yes, three great male actors in a beautifully filmed, black and white, Cinemascope gem. And look for the actual ex-boxer great, the Raging Bull himself, Jake LaMotta as bartender. (No coincidence that the sequel to The Hustler and Raging Bull about LaMotta are both Scorsese's, but that's another tale.) Director Robert Rossen might be better known for some top notch screenplays, but among his other films is the great boxing story, Body and Soul (1947).As much as Newman is amazing, a defining presence in nearly every scene, it is the one woman in the movie, Newman's girl Sarah, who gives it depth and, oddly, life. Piper Laurie bounced between the stage and screen for decades before and after The Hustler, and managed two Oscar nominations in that time, including here. She not only gives her character believable depth and pathos (when she is allowed to--many scenes she's just sitting and watching), but she brings out the human side of Newman. My favorite scenes are when the two of them have something of a life together.Director Robert Rossen might be better known for some top notch screenplays, but among his other films is the great Body and Soul (1947), about boxing.",8,2,2,24 April 2010
500 Days of Summer," More about editing cleverness than real deep feeling, but very fun anyway, and tender.
","500 Days of Summer (2009)OK. First--I liked this movie. I seem to emphasize reasons why it wasn't terrific below, but it's good to remember I liked it. And didn't love it.Maybe the clever beginning, insisting through a deep-voiced narrator with a twitch of humor, raises expectations a little: this is not a love story. But it looks and feels like one, and of course, it is one, whatever the end might imply. Love varies and is still love.The movie leans on its format, jumping from moment to moment back and forth through the year and a half of the movie, to give it some of its verve. Surprises are often created by a wry coupling of moments--a happy person as the elevator doors close turns to a sad person when they open, a couple hundred days later. And then back, to day 3 or day 40, or whatever gap might be mined for laughs and irony. This saves the movie, really, but it also becomes the movie, instead of the relationship between the two young leads. The relationship should be everything, and it is everything, of course, but it isn't really much. If you put the pieces back in chronological order, you have something not too amazing, something actually pretty dull, certainly not an hour and half's worth.The man, Tom, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the woman, Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel, are almost perfect. They're fun, they are witty, they are restrained as needed, they show tenderness. I liked them a lot, but I didn't love them, and neither did the person I saw the movie with. And if there is a film that needs a couple with magic on the screen, true chemistry, this is it. But then, of course, the ending might make sense in this light. But then, further, if the whole point is a movie about a romance that doesn't quite get off the ground, it keeps the movie grounded, too. I prefer a movie that takes off somehow.Except for some movie oddities, the events are told simply, and out of order. There is the dancing in the park (completely out of character, but I liked it because it was a breath of air, fresh or not, just air), and some split screen comparisons (sometimes just a way of layering the plot, sometimes to create plot, by creating a fantasy on one side and reality on the other). And these are good, even if they remind you that a lot of the rest is just plain vanilla. In all, the movie is fun, for sure, a joy even, and without glaring issues. Certain clichés are avoided--the woman is strong and smart, the man gentle and un-macho. They actually make a nice couple. But maybe slightly less interesting than some of your friends, who they don't make movies about for the simple reason they aren't interesting enough.",7,3,5,23 October 2009
The Day After Tomorrow," So endlessly forced and yet so endlessly beautiful...great effects!!
","The Day after Tomorrow (2004)Great and terrible.Wow, the effects are amazing, pure and simple. But--hey, look, really, this is such an absurd idea taken this far you have to laugh. And it's quite funny at times, not only when it wants to be (there are some funny one liners) but also in the whole scenario. And at other times it's seriously serious, action-adventure stuff.Of course you can't take any of it seriously, and so you go with the flow here and think the world's weather really could go south in a few days, that helicopters could run into a storm that would freeze the gas in the lines and make them crash, that a series of really pretty and awful tornadoes could wipe out Los Angeles in an hour, and so on. It's great visual stuff, and it's a perfect movie to watch while Hurricane Irene blows past and the trees are shaking their booty.Here's what's great. First, a huge range of scenes of terrifying weather, beautifully depicted. We're talking all kinds of hugely awful disasters, and lots of snow. Second, the acting though routine is vigorous and up to the task of talking over the storm noises and flashing lights. It's all pretty intense, start to finish. Even the Cheney-like vice-president plays his part well. And the idea that people are good is permeated in every scene. There are no looters, no selfish fools, just heroes and beautifully charitable people. It's too much, of course, but it's what you would hope for.What's fun? Lots of stuff. The homeless guy who knows good practical street stuff the rest don't know, the librarians who love books so much, the guys in space (brief but a new look), and all the weathermen who get whacked by flying buses. Okay, not so fun, but it's part of the free-for-all that is this movie. The wolves are amazing. What's wrong? Well, the science is bad, if anyone cares. An example comes right at the beginning when there is a large image of the ocean currents in the Atlantic, and the Gulf Stream is shown going backwards, or so it seems. It gets cold rather fast and rather extremely (150 below Fahrenheit). The hurricanes forming over land (without explanation) are gigantic. New York is abandoned (all 8 million people) except for a handful in said library. And the endless exceptionalism of people doing exactly what they are told they shouldn't do because they just have to. And their flashlights keep working, days later. Lucky.German director Roland Emmerich has a handful of similarly excessive films (like 'Independence Day'), and I think he isn't a bad director. I say this only to point out that he wrote the story and screenplay, too, and that's where the weakness lies, for sure.Maybe this is a test of personality. If you are an optimist, you'll enjoy what's good here, and there are so many terrific scenes you can't help but just look sometimes at the effect and the set design. It's a disaster film, pure and simple.",Null,3,6,28 August 2011
Match Point," Flawlessly filmed, Intensely Subtle, a Tight, almost Ibsen-like Drama
","Match Point (2005)Woody Allen's latest films, which I like a lot, are not overtly original. We are miles from Bananas, Stardust Memories, and Zelig. We are not even in the same room as other intimate dramas like Annie Hall or Hannah and Her Sisters. Match Point almost feels like a perfectly executed exercise in making an ordinary film, but making it so well we are spellbound and willing. There is a feeling as you watch that something more should happen, and maybe that's the genius of it, when something more does happen and it isn't so outrageous after all. Except in the usual sense--outrageous for Allen, and for a few other special filmmakers, used to mean charting new territory.The movie is so finely balanced it's hard to find what to note in particular. But maybe, as a photographer, I'll start with the camera-work, not because it's stellar, but because it's invisible. And this invisibility is the film's trademark, some might say its only flaw. If you do watch the camera-work, though, you'll see no amazing light, no sweeping or swooping moving shots, no hand-held jitters, no black and white aura (all things Allen has used in the past). Instead, the visuals are in service to the story--superbly professional and subtle.Everyone and every thing is out to support the story. Remember, Woody Allen is a writer, and maybe a writer above all. His fascination with an innocent person doing something wrong--from cheating on his woman to murder--appears more frequently in his films, and he makes it so terribly real, and subtle, and vivid, it becomes a real shock on the screen. And yet a shock with coat and tie, just theatrical and polite enough to avoid being literally shocked. Instead we experience a kind of theater-shock, the surprise and delight (and dismay) at seeing the character do something shocking, beyond the fourth wall.This isn't meant to be double talk. I'm stressing how finely tuned the performances are woven together to enhance the basic events as a beautiful stage act. Yet it's on film, and filmed and directed with elegant subtlety. Three of Allen's most recent movies--Match Point, Vicki Christina Barcelona, and Cassandra's Dream--take a similar approach to life, crime, and infidelity, rooted in earlier films like his masterpiece Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) and Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993). By itself, it's a body or work to distinguish any director. I know people who dismiss many of Allen's films basically because they aren't what they expected, his middle period serious films like Another Woman (1988), for example, but that's a shame. He's still at it, in a more conventional vein, for sure, but brilliantly, memorably.",8,2,3,17 July 2009
Midnight in Paris," The Sun Also Rises come to life, in a way...a fun, lightweight time trip
","Midnight in Paris (2011)Total wish fulfillment. Who wouldn't want to drift back now and then and visit some cultural heroes in their own time--you know, Ernest Hemingway, Cole Porter, Picasso? Well, that's all this movie does. It does it brilliantly, and in the 'flashbacks' which are really more like time travel scenes, the set design, music, and invented dialog of these icons is terrific. Like many people, I think Paris in the 1920s was the greatest cultural hot spot since Florence in the Renaissance. But that's all this movie really does, and if it's enough, you're going to love it. The plot laid over this, including a strained and irritating cast of early 21st Century ungrateful Ugly Americans, is painful. Not only does it seem false (like these are just 'types' without real depth), but it's crudely filmed (lighting and camera-work) and actually badly acted, overall. You might think this was all on purpose, to contrast in every way then and now. Certainly it's the same crew, same writer (Woody Allen), and same director (Woody Allen) in both parts of the movie.And same lead actor, Owen Wilson, who is perfect in both roles (he is the one consistent presence). He's a dreamy writer who likes Paris in the rain. And he wishes he could just go back to those glory days when the arts were spilling out of the cafes at night on the Left Bank. So, by magic, he does, and so do we. If everything is a cliché, it almost has to be--Gertrude Stein played wonderfully by Kathy Bates, Zelda Fitzgerald by Alison Pill. There are some twenty famous people who show up (some briefly, like Man Ray, who is badly portrayed, and Josephine Baker, who doesn't get a speaking part, naturally). But they are all backdrop, in a way, to the idea, the time travel foremost but also the bigger idea that we sometimes think we'd be happier in another time.And the movie ends on the sweet note that in fact we just need to look around at what we have in our time and appreciate it.As a movie beyond just entertainment, it's easy to get frustrated. One good friend of mine, a true movie buff and not a Woody Allen fan, loved it. But he's a nostalgia freak. In the theater, two young women got up and left after half an hour, even while it was getting interesting. In my friend's case, he was taken in (as I was) by all the famous figures and what they might have been like (and what they might say). The two young women, I'm guessing, didn't know the references. They didn't know who Scott and Zelda, Cole, and maybe even Ernest were. Or didn't care. Which is an important truth in this kind of movie filled with references. Like a lot of post-modern art, it's only good for insiders. Unlike Allen's 'Zelig' (a far more inventive and zany and complicated film, if imperfect, too), the references here are mostly for an older cultured crowd. There are hints of his 'The Purple Rose in Cairo' as well, a fantasy to another world, a seemingly (or actually) better one, but that's a brilliant movie filled with pathos. 'Midnight in Paris' is an extended trick, a one-liner, and as fun as it is, keep at least some of your expectations slim.",Null,9,13,12 July 2011
A Bridge Too Far," Too long, too much, but technically very well done
","A Bridge too Far (1977)A must for WWII fans, but dubious for people looking for a drama that happens to be a war drama.Here's why. First the upside. This was researched and choreographed in great detail. Some of the participants were at the original battle (or nearby). And there is a sense not of grandiose 'The Longest Day' kind of drama, but of something that shows the nitty gritty of an important but not legendary battle toward the end of the war. There is a ton of action, very vivid and pyrotechnic, filmed with smooth precision, and edited down well even though the movie is still too long.The downside is partly that the movie is too long. They include too much. And frankly, as good as the action stuff is, there's too much of it. The ability to do this kind of thing really well isn't reason to do it too much. ('Saving Private Ryan' has the same dilemma, and I think faces it better, with the amazing filming of action at Normandy.)Furthermore, this is all action and all history. That's probably enough for people who are into it—and it's gripping, for sure, at its best. But the key missing ingredient is real characters. There's an attempt to give each of the stars and their colleagues enough for the audience to grasp, but it's never enough. The problems of the campaign and the personalities that pushed for it and doubted it are clear. But they aren't convincing.And one of the problems is there is just too much going on for such a short movie. That's no joke. It could have been a t.v. mini-series, and the characters could have been developed. Instead we get a few minutes screen time—at best —of most of the key players. And there are a lot of big names involved, each for a million to five million dollars each. And that's with Joseph Levine (the producer) pushing hard to save money. It never feels bloated, just superficial. Oh! There's Robert Redford, there's Michael Caine, there's Laurence Olivier, and so on, with their key but tiny appearances. Don't blink.So we end up back with the history, and the brutality (and spoiled brat attitude) of the Nazi Germans. It's good (and horrifying stuff, for sure, but there are lots of better WWI movies on many levels. This one is for people looking to fill in gaps and get the specifics.A last note. This came out after the shift in Hollywood to newer ('New Hollywood') films in the late 60s, and it feels out of place. Other war dramas like 'Patton' 'M.A.S.H.' and 'Catch-22' all from 1970 and then just after this one in 1978 and 1979, 'The Deer Hunter' and 'Apocalypse Now,' all offer something more contemporary and compelling in terms of style and movie-making. And character.",6,2,7,8 June 2016
The Terminator," A cultural touchstone and terrific plot that wears itself thin after some time has passed
","The Terminator (1984)I just saw this first Terminator movie in 2014 for the third time, and I expected something more, and different from it. Naturally, the surprise is gone, and I think the plot idea is maybe the strongest point to the whole movie. The movie is directed with panache, for sureâ€”the effects, the action, the deliberate lack of depth, the epic glossy wow of it all. But it's not a rich movie, it doesn't have depths, it frankly lacks enough to make a second or third viewing worth the trouble. Unless, of course, you are already invested and committed to it for personal reasons.The first shot, very early in the movie, when the naked Schwarzenegger appears crouched in the urban night, is archetypal and terrific. And then he moves and interacts (still naked, though you don't see that) and the comic element is in place. And here we have the movie, both profound to the point of being moved, and kitschy and puerile, too. It's sort of meant to be a accessible and direct, and that makes it a great first viewing. The plot is certainly loaded with big (huge) twists and mind-bending ideas. And we want so much for right to triumph over evil. You have to ask eventually about the acting. Maybe we need a stiff automaton in the role of the robotic machine that is known as the 'terminator' (a cyborg). So the future governor of California is off the hook. But the other main lead, the woman known so well as Sarah Connor, is a so-so actress. No way around the plain approach she has to being a regular girl caught up in the largest story possible. The other time-traveller, a human played by Michael Biehn, is pure nuts and bolts stuff, too. In fact, it's hard to really love any of the performances, except maybe the police chief. All of this boils down to a movie that scores very high on concept and on the basic effects. This is what drives it to stardom. But leave it at that. Love it for what it is, plain and simple. James Cameron, the lauded and wealthy director in charge, is no genius here, but is very very able. That's a back-handed compliment, for sure. But lovers of Kubrick or Ridley Scott know what I mean.A re-alignment of the stars for this one. Over time.",7,2,6,9 February 2014
Once," Utterly sweet, very low budget, honest and also very limited.
","Once (2006)This has the best of cinema and worst of cinema. It's heartfelt and honest with a leading pair of actors who are as pure as snow in a world that is a blur around them. And it's also a slow tale filled with songs that start to sound the same and that's filmed without either panache or grit.I went into this intending to love it. An Irish busker in Dublin falls in love with an immigrant single mom, and these two people who really are suited for each other try to find a way to make it work. Or if not quite try, they see that they are living in a moment of magic together and want it to stick. This movie is about that magic. Brief, beautiful, idealistic, and filled with some really good singing and songwriting.That's what people love about this movie and why it has such a good following (and rating, if you pay attention to the starts). Watch it on that basis.If you are looking at the film at all as a work of art, as a piece of collaboration between writer, actor, photographer, director, and so on, you're bound to feel it coming up short and shorter. As much as you love the main guy's utter kindness--a profoundly great model of kindness--you notice that things drag a bit, and that a few clichés appear, like the moment on the beach, meant to be lyrical happiness and it reads as meaning to be more than really conveying. And that songs start to be similar, and are even repeated. On some level this is a huge music video, because most (most!) of the movie is made of songs set to various situations, and new situations are brought in so that new songs (or old ones) can be performed. It's easy to love the music but also get enough of it.Another way to weigh all this out is to compare to a movie I saw recently at a festival, an equally low budget affair about a singer-songwriter looking for love and meaning, 'I Am Not a Hipster.' Now that is a truly inspired affair: complex, beautifully envisioned, off the beaten track. None of those descriptions apply to 'Once.'But then, 'Once' has one of the best bittersweet endings I've seen. It's the last five minutes that will mean the most. And maybe seem familiar, those things that mean so much that you don't quite keep. Except in your heart forever.",7,2,4,14 November 2012
Catch-22," The best is astonishing, but as a whole it's barely a shadow of the book
","Catch-22 (1970)This should have been a brilliant movie, brilliant. It is based on one of the touchstone American novels post-WWII. It has a series of actors any other director would die for, or kill for: Anthony Perkins, Martin Balsam, Bob Newhart, Alan Arkin, Paula Prentiss, Richard Benjamin, and even Art Garfunkel, who sings better than he acts, surely. And there is Martin Sheen and Jon Voigt, too. And heck, throw in Orson Welles (yup).Oh, and directing? Mike Nichols. It's 1970, the middle of Vietnam, and a year after 'M.A.S.H.' which may have unduly influenced the tone here. Nichols had only directed two features before this--'Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe'(which won Best Picture) and 'The Graduate' (which should have, and which is one of the best New Hollywood movies).Parts of the movie are utterly hilarious--when the movie theme from '2001' breaks out (simply because the main character, the infamous Yosarian, sees a woman), it's not only funny for its excess, it's a jab at Kubrick's over-seriousness. Give Welles credit for showing up, and for doing a humorless job. In a way, he gets what Nichols wants better than anyone. The one ongoing flaw to the movie is the acting, which is too often silly. It's like they are having fun, and if Heller's book is funny, it's not because the characters are being funny. It's because what they say and do is absurd. That's completely different. Martin Balsam is one of the worst for this, making a comic role out of a surreal one.So when the movie is simply absurd or surreal--a kind of deadpan frightening ludicrousness that might actually have been true--it's terrific. When it turns to slapstick, even slightly (fumbling, making smart cracks, or just laughing at themselves), it fumbles. When it turns to utter seriousness, as in Yosarian's night walk through the old town, seeing in succession the horrors not of war, but of life itself, it's deeply troubling and moving. And brilliant. Yes, the movie can often be brilliant. So it's a halting experience, patched together, with too many pauses between episodes. Disappointing, but a revelation about the impossibility of infallibility. And for heaven's sake, read the book if you haven't.",7,3,9,5 December 2010
Snatch," See it on the biggest screen you can--this is about the ride, not the destination
","Snatch (2000)Director Guy Ritchie is most famous as a filmmaker, and that says a lot, because he could have become known as Madonna's husband. And he survives (and thrives, commercially) on two knock out, inventive, slightly zany and slightly brilliant films, 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' followed by this one. Both have a bigger than life, faster than life, slightly impossible feel that is something like Tarantino in 'Kill Bill' or maybe Jarmusch in 'Ghost Dog.' 'Snatch.' is the second of the two and is a bigger budget, more mainstream movie in some ways, and this might seem to be a good thing, though there are avid fans of his first film for its fresh intensity, for sure. 'Snatch' is kept alive by the constant breaking of the time line, the really absurd and kinetic presence of Brad Pitt (who is brilliant), and the overall plot line(s) which are filled with twisted archetypes. It's also well constructed and filmed without becoming slick. But in the end, you'll find that the two movies are too similar to make sense in some ways. And both films have this sense of being actually about nothing, in the end. They are just wild rides. But such rides. Sometimes you just want to get in your car and drive and have things happen, and so they do here, and it's totally Fun. Fun capital F because in a way, why not make that the goal. Clearly there is no social message or deep psychology at work, which is just fine with me. And so you need to position yourself to float in this world, and see how richly constructed it is, you just watch and have things happen. On those terms it's remarkable.",8,2,5,20 March 2011
BlacKkKlansman," An entertaining ride through some harrowing material
","BlacKkKlansman (2018)The problem with this movie is exactly why Spike Lee made it: it is political activism. It's well made and a decent bit of storytelling with good acting and a strong underlying story. But it overtly pushes its message, and makes no effort to hide that.
But this isn't a Michael Moore documentary. This is a film based on a true story, with actors and some embellishments. And it pushes the obvious, clichÃ©s and all. It does this not only in the end and beginning, which are bookends that announce their message, but also in the story itself, by keeping it simple to the point of simplistic. Maybe that's unfair and extreme--on second viewing I realized the movie is first rate filmmaking, whatever its limitations.
If you get the story, and even if you empathize completely with the message, the effect as a movie, as a feature film out to create drama and move and shape you, this effect is flimsy and false. Yes, false even, because you know a grittier, more complicated truth must be there.
You do end up thinking of director Spike Lee's other films here, like the brilliant 'Malcolm X' and its own historical reconstruction, or 'Do the Right Thing' with its more fictional immersion and conviction. And this one, 'BlacKkKlansman,' is less lyrical even though it is quite well filmed, and less moving even though built on compelling facts.
The conventional core of the movie is good (and sometimes fun and funny), with the infiltration of some KKK types (made generally caricatures to the point of being almost comic, which is a shame). However, the last scenes with all the high fives might drive you crazy, and the documentary footage will make you realize there are more penetrating things out there than the movie you just watched.
It's good, I'm glad I saw it, but it's half of what it could have been. But in truth (seeing it a second time), it's very well made and compelling. But for
Spike Lee (at his best) it ends up half of what he has pulled off in the past. Which isn't so bad at all. Watch it!",7,29,62,6 September 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Fail-Safe on crack, LSD, and steroids!
","Dr. Strangelove (1964)Fail-Safe on crack, LSD, and steroids!One secret to making a flawless movie is to make it so idiosyncratic you can't tell flaws from insights, weaknesses from flashes of innovation. Surely this movie has its weaknesses, and I know people who have seen it who like to point them out. Yes, it has sexist moments and silly ones, and maybe even a couple of slow ones. But really, it's so audacious and funny and tragic and ironic, who can say what is what, and why, taken whole?What you can be clear about about is whether it succeeds, whether it stirs you. I know I'm moved and tickled every time, even if I groan sometimes, too. George C. Scott's performance is sometimes just too much, but then he does a backflip and my faith is restored. Hayden is such a stiff actor at his best, he is cast in the role of a lifetime here and comes through with dark absurdity. And Peter Sellers? Which one? Hilarious.Made the same year as Fail-Safe (both are from 1964, the height of the Cold War), Dr. Strangelove, shows the further evolution of the insane directing genius of Stanley Kubrick. This is the first of his three great breakthrough movies that seem to be shamelessly new and fresh--2001 and A Clockwork Orange followed--and it really is breathtaking for its audacity. Dr. Strangelove is so utterly different in tone and yet so parallel in intent and background to Fail-Safe, it's just weird. Does it make light of annihilation? Does the military, and the President, look foolish? And Peter Sellers? Which one?",10,3,6,23 June 2009
The Beach," Expensively produced cheap entertainment--a fantasy without the treasure
","The Beach (2000)You want to like this movie, for sure. It's about a dream come true, if if you've ever travelled even a little in this backpacker Gringo trail kind of way, you'll feel like you're there.But then, it's also just a movie, and it shows an indulgence now and then, an implausibility not in the big idea (which is absurd--and digitally invented, by the way, the beach part), but in certain interactions. The people are implausible, the situation, the feel good idealism. When it goes bad, it's only in a ridiculous way (the first hint is when our star, Leonardo DiCaprio, defends himself from a shark and he gets blamed for making the shark angry).The beach itself is a kind of tropical trope (I never thought I'd get the chance to say that--tropical trope, tropical trope). That is, it is only what perfect beaches are--protected sands, aqua waters, no bugs, no snakes, no poor natives trolling for alms. It's a kind of Club Med without the corporation. So naturally it's appealing, but only in a superficial way. And the whole movie echoes this obviousness, this shallowness. Even the big conflicts are kind storybook simplistic, and a bit silly, or overly sad (near the end, with the shootings). DiCaprio is terrific, really likable. The other famous star is Tilda Swinton who does her best in a role that maybe didn't have room for much depth--she's the ruler queen of sorts. The others I didn't know (a couple are director Danny Boyle regulars, it seems). Oh, did I say Danny Boyle? Yes, this is a film by the guy who did Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting, both throbbing, excessive, and amazing movies in their own ways. And probably equally insensitive (to the poor in India, the anti-drug forces), so it's no surprise that he stepped on the toes of the locals when filming 'The Beach' by bulldozing the beach and ignoring protests. (The big tsunami reshaped it back to what it was, a small consolation for that disaster.)So, if you don't mind a lot of niggling issues and downright meaninglessness, and just want to fantasize a bit, you might enjoy a lot of this movie. You might settle for Cape Cod, though, if that's your second choice.",6,2,4,8 December 2010
Begin Again," It feels good, sounds passable, looks great, and is a really worn out plot
","Begin Again (2013)A charming tale of love a music in New York.Yes, I suppose that's a lead that could be reused for a lot of movies. And that's the biggest drawback here—it's another feelgood movie with people overcoming the odds and making it. Is it well done? Sometimes, yes. Mark Ruffalo as a down-on-his luck music producer is strong, giving that cliché some honest believability. (He drinks, but he's not suicidal, he has been kicked out by his wife, but he's still pretty normal with her and their daughter.) So really Ruffalo and his wife played with usual natural charm (and only briefly) by Catherine Keener create a relatable normalcy here. In a world that is usually all hype.But then, this is New York, not Los Angeles, and so the city and its gritty realism has a large role. And a critical role, since the starving young musician who is ostensibly the largest star, played by Keira Knightley, plays her gigs on location throughout New York. So part of the movie is a kind of fast tour of groovy spots in the city, the musicians performing and recording as they go. Cool.The weak point for me was frankly the music. Most of it was invented somehow for Knightley and her makeshift band, composed by some little known music professionals behind the scenes (like Gregg Alexander). Knightley did play and sing on her own, and I guess you have to admire her picking up those new skills. But she's not great. In fact she's just as good as the average good performer in your family (and if you're a Jackson or a Cash, this doesn't apply to you). So you have to just go with the flow and the plot and promise to not care.And so it feels and looks pretty good. And has a fun final moment where the album is released and sold for a dollar on the internet (this is a small spoiler, I admit)—but it matters because if you go to get the soundtrack to the movie, it ain't a buck. It's $9.99 on iTunes, and I don't recommend it.So the whole sham of it all sinks in. This is just another vehicle for a well-worn idea and some rather decent acting in a beautiful city.",5,6,10,3 November 2014
Alien," The First of a New Sci-Fi Horror Breed
","Alien (1979)The First of a New Sci-Fi Horror BreedIt's hard to believe how fresh and scary this movie was at the time, but it's also a relief to see it still holds up as a well made movie even now. Is it a classic great movie? Almost, almost. But not quite, in the end--mostly because of some clichés and goofs in the acting and dialog--although it has really great moments. And it's a great way to discover director Ridley Scott's unique style.Certainly now that H. R. Giger the artist has gotten famous in his own right, the alien itself deserve special mention. And the sets are impressively otherworldly and familiar at the same time--not only the huge and hugely baroque ship, but the interior scenes on the planet toward the beginning. These are marvels whether or not your style (and for my money, the alien is a really improbable type of extraterrestrial, more at home in a comic book Hades than actual space). Another novelty to note, probably a product of the shift in movies in general since the 1960s, is the director's intention to keep things real and everyday. Things are dirty, people worry about their paychecks, and so on. This is a long way from the sterility of 2001 though head to head the earlier Kubrick film is on another level of art. I know a lot of people would rather be entertained, though, and Alien is entertaining. It's fast, it's scary, it's gory, it's messy. It's surprising. It's beautiful. And it spawned a whole series of follow-ups, the next one confusingly called Aliens (1986), also a very good take on the new genre.I first saw this when it came out in Colorado and it was on a huge, curving screen that wrapped around the audience, and I was really, truly scared. Now, thirty years later, the scary parts are still really scary, and it's edited so quickly you won't spend more than a minute on any one scene that doesn't quite click. Horror sci-fi has never been the same since.",8,8,12,7 July 2009
Horrible Bosses," Fast and crazy hilarity
","Horrible Bosses (2011)Well, you have to expect a comedy like this to be really stupid, too, and it's funny because it's stupid and sometimes stupid because it's so funny. Oh yeah, just let it ride. Sex talk and murder rap and subtle looks on top of blatant wise cracks and other kinds of cracks (with toothbrush) and a mixed up crossed-purpose insane deluge of nutsy events one after another.Not to mention an all star cast, with some of the biggest stars in cameo roles (I mean, Bob Newhart and Donald Sutherland, for Pete's sake), and Jennifer Aniston and Jamie Foxx and a hilarious Colin Farrell (of course) plus the stars, like the ever evil funny Kevin Spacey.Is this a great movie? (--Buzzer sound.--) Wrong question. Is it funny? Yup. A lot. Stupid? Yup, often. But well made, lots of fun twists, and good time is had by all. Sorry about the stars. It's not a great movie in any other sense--but wait, isn't a comedy just supposed to be funny?Yup.",7,6,12,8 April 2012
Black Mass," Strong performances in familiar plot
","Black Mass (2015)Well, Johnny Depp is amazing—almost unrecognizable in this role as a psychopathic Irish mobster. And the vivid realism of lat 1970s and 1980s Boston is impressive—really gorgeous and believable. These are the strengths.The story is, however, another mobster movie where one group is out to get another, and there are betrayals and revenge killings and beatings and a kind of unraveling of the underworld as it gets more and more extreme. Sometimes there's pathos or ironic beauty, but this is no 'Godfather' nor 'Goodfellas.' The characters blend together and so we never quite identify with anyone. And Depp plays the main bad man and, unlike Marlon Brando (for example) he lacks anything even remotely human or admirable. So the viewer is left cold, watching things happen at a distance. It's not unemotional—sometimes it's horrible and shocking—but it's not about feeling for the characters in their brutal, calculating desperate situation. And there is a lot of violence of a very unflinching kind, harder to take than, say, Tarantino's where it's over the top and theatrical. I think this is a kind of good movie that just doesn't rise above. And there are so many movies like this it makes it unnecessary. Good, yes, but old territory.",7,1,1,22 May 2016
The Best Years of Our Lives," Highly structured but flawless and really moving drama about returning G.I.s
","The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)The whole point of this film when it was released still makes perfect sense today, though I'm sure it doesn't have the same impact it did in those first years after World War II ended. Returning servicemen, with all kinds of backgrounds before and during the war, hit a wall coming home: wives who no longer loved them, jobs that had dried up, a culture that was foreign to them and that found them, these men, to be foreign themselves.It wasn't a crisis to take lightly. These were the guys who were drafted to fight the enemy, and in going overseas they lost some of the best years of their lives, if not their lives. The country knew its debt in the abstract, but it also knew it in sons and husbands who really did come home and who had to face it all. This movie was both a reckoning for the sake of national healing and a brilliant drama that would be beautifully pertinent and therefore successful. And what a success, then and now.The consummate Hollywood director William Wyler shows in this fast, long movie just what a master he is at working the medium. With Gregg Toland at the camera, Wyler makes a highly fluid movie, visual and dramatic and weirdly highly efficient. With the three main plots interweaving and depending on each other, the drama (and melodrama) build but never beyond plausibility. Wyler knew his audience wouldn't put up with pandering or cheap mistakes. Casting Harold Russell as Homer, knowing the audience would hear about how Russell really was a soldier who lost both hands in the war, was a huge step toward creating both empathy and credibility. It even practices a key theme in the move--to go beyond your bounds to make a difference, to give these guys a break and help them assimilate.It's interesting how singular this movie is, trying to show the truth in these kinds of situations. The other post-war films about army and navy men fall into two large and dominating categories--war films and film noir. And it is film noir that comes closest to getting at the problem of the G.I. not reintegrating well, making it a whole style, brooding and spilling over with violence. 'The Best Years of Our Lives' has a highly controlled and even contrived plot structure, but it aims to be honest and representative. That it's remarkable formally--the way it is shot and edited and acted, top to bottom--is not surprise, given the heights that Hollywood had reached by then, and given that Wyler is easily the slickest of them all, in the best sense. That the movie makes such beautiful sense and really works as a story, a moving and heartwarming story without undue sappiness, is a whole other kind of achievement. A terrific, rich, full-blooded, uncompromised movie.",10,25,26,4 October 2010
Closer," A drama through and through--dense, fast, extraordinary, and made cinematic and large
","Closer (2004)Mike Nichols made clear in his first film, 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' (1966) that he was going to make intense, inter-personal films that carried over the best of serious theater and that were photographically cinematic. He's succeeded like few, if any directors, have. And he's a comic actor, a comedian, at heart, which might explain the humanity and laughs that infuse some gripping situations.'Closer' is based on a play, and like 'Virginia Woolf' it has four principle actors whose lives and actions interweave and collide in the most disturbing and believable ways. This core is essential to getting somewhere gutsy. In less than two hours, the nature of this kind of liberal contemporary relationship is plumbed more convincingly that you would think possible. Not that this is exactly a realistic film. It's too extreme, too perfect, too glitzy, too fast to quite accept as 'true.' But it's convincing the way great drama is, and all four actors, amazingly, rise to the occasion. Clive Owen stands out for his charming and very masculine intensity, and Natalie Portman for her self-destructive and angry neediness, yes. But equally important are Julia Roberts in a role where she uses her simpler complexion to open up to a fragile interior, and Jude Law in a role where his tenderness and lack of inner strength are in the end his undoing.Everyone here is flawed, and everyone is admirable. And for a movie to make this clear, and to make a workable, fast plot unfold, in such a compact and beautiful way is a marvel. Nichols is really at the top of his form. If the visual tapestry isn't as mind boggling as 'The Graduate' and if the plot is not as politically savage as some other earlier films ('Silkwood' and even the flawed 'Catch-22' are two), it makes up for it by being really tight. There's not a square inch or a bare second wasted here. In fact, the speeding through a year at a time, from one cut to the next, makes you have to pay attention, though the clues are carefully in place.A masterpiece.",10,5,9,6 September 2010
Shutter Island," It's so well made, the unsurprising twists end up deflating a visual masterpiece
","Shutter Island (2010)You know when a friend tells a story and includes lots of interesting details, and tells it really well so you listen to everything, and then they finish and you think, 'And?'There is a lot of that on Shutter Island. Martin Scorsese is a director who knows very much how to tell a story. And this movie, told so well, might become famous for having no punch line. It's not that the end is bad or illogical, or that getting there was so bad. Just the opposite. The end is heartwrenching and sensible, and the two hours getting there is fabulous stuff, great movie-making, and filled with all kinds of strange and beautiful moments.So you have to realize this is more about being there than the actual story. It's a finely tuned work of art, really, as a visual experience, and with a fabulous score. Expect another solid, impassioned performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, along with a whole host of superb secondary acts. Even just the island with its cliffs and gloom and sprawling old brick buildings is creepy and fantastic. The characters on it, from the glaring cops with shotguns to the host of crazed and criminally insane people, are colorful to say the least, but not exaggerated. Once you realize that the cunning Ben Kingsley is in charge or that Max von Sydow is possibly an ex-Nazi at the end of his life, you really pay attention. And then, as if this isn't enough, there begin flashbacks to World War II, and to a brutal murder, and other visions appear, including some really dreamy moments of magical realism. And you wonder how real it all is and whether it actually relates to the basic point of DiCaprio's being there as a federal marshal.As usual with this kind of movie, the setting is a pastiche of places far apart, though all in the North East, including famous Peddocks Island in Boston Harbor (which is a park, not a prison). The horrible treatment of the German (and other) prison guards shown in the Dachau scenes has some basis in truth, but in fact was probably more sporadic and messier, and did not apparently involve a whole lineup of American shooters. You can look up the Dachau Massacre for details, but of course, the bigger (much bigger) massacre that is Dachau itself belongs to Nazi cruelty, and is represented with reasonable (if cinematic) fairness here, toning down (if anything) the gruesomeness. There is a long history of unethical experiments on mental patients held by the U.S. Government, though nothing I could find that involved this particular surgical option (by the government). Lobotomies (including those made with an ice-pick sort of instrument from the eye socket, into the brain, scrambling it up a bit) were still an option available to doctors in the 1950s, when this movie was made.Still, I wouldn't take any of this movie as a history lesson. It simply layers up lots of real horrors with the imaginary ones of the fictional plot, which is pretty horrible, too. In all, we have a formal gem, a masterful construction that will dazzle and beguile your eyes and ears. But might leave you, as it has many viewers, wanting a little more for your own unscrambled brain, too.",7,3,7,21 June 2010
Interstellar," Ambitions make the filming amazing and the plot illogical to sentimental absurdity
","Interstallar (2014)This is a Christopher Nolan movie. So when it does what he does best—shake you out of your seat with cinematic brilliance—it's terrific. I mean terrific. There are effects, like the black hole, or the various spacecraft maneuvers, and even a few wild dashes through cornfields, that work so well you don't need to think about why they are happening. You are immersed, and impressed, and wowed.But Nolan is more clever than deep it seems. A movie like 'Memento' takes the slimmest of terrific ideas (a reordering of time in the brain) and make it amazing to watch. Movies like his Batman trilogy avoid even cleverness and work with pure energy and mythology. But in all of these there is no sense of what you would call 'meaning.' They are entertainments. 'Interstellar' is purely horrible science—it's the butt of endless jokes on the web. But behind all the liberties and mistakes there, the movie is trying to say something 'deep' about being human in an inhuman universe. About the special qualities humans have to be innovative, to procreate, and most of all to love. This is a bowing down to the power of love. Love conquers all, that kind of thing.Maybe it's the brother, Jonathan Nolan, who is responsible here as the co-writer. The grandiose ideas the two of them present in 'Batman Rises' are wonderfully impossible and almost laughable if you take them out of context. (In context they're part of the whole great success of the movie.) But 'Interstallar' takes itself seriously. Way too seriously for this kind of material and with no grip on the science, not even a hint of it. As a fantasy, it could have gone so much farther, as a piece of art based on reality, well, go see 'Gravity' for an alternative that makes a better (imperfect) attempt to follow the rules of nature.There is of course the plot here, saving the world, saving the species, saving your family. You have to just go with the flow here, as well, since it's all a bit romanticized in a Spielberg/Cameron kind of plasticky gloss. It frankly made me sick—and yet it was so well filmed I liked it. That's the kicker—Nolan is terrific with the camera, and with the vision of making things vivid and big.See this movie for all of those best things. I saw it on a celluloid (non-digital) IMAX screen and in those portions of the movie shot in full 70mm large format, the effects were memorable. (The movie alternates between standard widescreen 35mm film and full, academy ratio 70mm, which is taller and has far more detail. The normal theater presentations approximate the effects, but in a more normal scale and resolution.) Obviously this movie has won a lot of people over. I'm not sure who they are, but it's reasonable to be blown away. Nolan has openly defended himself against all the complaints—as if everyone is wrong and we just don't get it. Fine. If you want a hilarious rundown of some of the many logical problems of the movie, see http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/11/08/interstellar-plot-holes/ or type interstallar plot holes entertainment weekly in google.But what until you see it first and just enjoy it on its own terms.",7,5,10,13 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Well made, with punch, but very straight forward for Kubrick
","Full Metal Jacket (1987)An extremely straight forward, funny, and tragic Vietnam War movie, going from the excessive rigors of boot camp to the hard core horrors of hand to hand combat. Stanley Kubrick shows the bare bones of it, without romanticizing, and without making heroes out of anyone. There are two main emotional turning points, one at the end of boot camp, and one near the end of the movie, and both are about the madness of war and about death. And both are pulled out of the mainstream thread of the story with a jolt. It's sensationalism, really, but made with Kubrick rigor. A balance to all the horror is the humor, not as insane as, say Dr. Strangelove, but with a similar dry wit. The first forty minutes of the film are justly famous for their almost campy but still believable scenes of the sergeant training young Marines. (And this sarge is a real Vietnam vet who did this kind of training.)Compare this movie to Platoon and you'll see a much more restrained movie, and without the jungle warfare we usually associate with Vietnam. Platoon makes people out to be larger than life, and Kubrick intends more to say, hey, this is the real deal, whatever cinematic tricks are showing. But compare this to Apocalypse Now or Deer Hunter and you might start to wish Kubrick hadn't played it so straight. Full Metal Jacket lacks, above all, imagination, and as a movie, it needs it.",7,1,2,6 July 2010
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A great movie, in many ways flawless
","Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri (2017) A stunning, moving, funny as heck movie. You almost have to compare it to 'Fargo' for its depth and wit simultaneously. Both movies dig into a caricatured America, in this case the South (I'm not sure they ever say where, but it feels like Georgia.) The great character here has to be the woman who pays for ads on billboards, and who drives the plot--Frances McDormand--and who also happens to be the amazing lead in 'Fargo.' Yeah. Here she doesn't quite don a full southern accent the way she became rural Minnesota in a lick, but she's a perfect type, and tough. Around her are the nuanced but funny kinds of people you'd expect, especially a cadre of cops that includes Woody Harrelson, always an asset, this time as an honorable chief of police with cancer. The third big name is Sam Rockwell, who is terrific as a troubled cop. His role grows as the movie twists. Any scene with McDormand and Harrelson, or with her and Rockwell, is really amazing. Good acting is good acting.
 The script here is great. I think it is the screenplay of the year and should get the Oscar, never mind the fun originality of 'Get Out' which lacks the subtle insights and natural language here.  There are other levels to love this movie on, from the music (Carter Burwell) to the photography (Ben Davis). Almost no one is a famous contributor beyond the actors, including the director and writer, Martin McDonagh. That's partly what makes it all fresh and honest. 
 It's a great movie. Do not miss it.",10,9,20,4 March 2018
The Grapes of Wrath," All fiction, but oh so real and vivid and photographically striking.
","The Grapes of Wrath (1940)A John Ford, Gregg Toland masterpiece. Even if you don't like the social politics, which people in 1940 often did not (the government was helping the poor too generously and so forth), you have to love the movie. Henry Fonda is only the beginning of a series of tough, beautiful performances. And the series of heartbreaks is balanced by glimmers of hope.Most of all, oddly, is that this is a cinematic masterpiece, tightly constructed, and seen (and photographed) with aesthetic intelligence. Maybe the most amazing performance is Ma Joad (Jane Darwell), who commands the role of an earthy, wise, smart woman fighting the disintegration of her family. She's quite astonishing.Toland's photography is worth noting not only for the usual framing of the shots or the occasional moving camera (when it moves through the squatter camp, slowly, showing the parade of poor people, it's quite striking), but for his use of minimal light. This isn't some film noir effect, but a way of capturing the candlelight, firelight, and just dim night skies that were very real, and very effective here. Great stuff.Dorothea Lange, the FSA photographer who set the framework for the visuals in this movie, is of a special order of photographer, visual but highly human and emotional. And empathetic. Ford and Toland manage to make this into a non stop moving experience, over two hours, and it's no small feat. The fact these are all actors, and yet they are so convincing, adds just another level of appreciation. Yes, great stuff.",9,2,4,6 October 2010
American Sniper," Solid, moving Iraq War stuff, a bit by the book but well done
","American Sniper (2014)1) For those familiar with the military culture in the U.S. this will offer some familiar insights into how families deal with their servicemen overseas.2) For those who know the war in Iraq either directly or through the movies, this will add to a series of rather good movies (though only movies, to be sure) about that tense conflict. It doesn't have the depth of 'The Hurt Locker' and others, but it's well done, and has real impact.3) For the idea of a sniper, the adulated and reviled rifleman who picks people off on the edges of battle, this movie goes far, and this is probably the unique contribution of the film.4) As a movie, as a construction of scenes and flow of narrative ideas, it's good, very good, but nothing beyond the normally well made movies that Clint Eastwood (the director) and many others with professional backing manage to pull off. It's not easy, but it's stuck a bit in its methods, the movie-making protocols.I number these because everyone has strong opinions about the content of this movie (and to an extent the director with his well known conservative politics). I don't know what to make of it in a larger context because I'm not an Eastwood fan outside of his movies, and I'm not in favor of what happened in Iraq. Politically. However, once you send our young men and women into a war zone, you have to understand the war for what it is, not for what it might have been if it wasn't. Obviously.The revelation of this movie is that it makes clear what it is to be in this troubled situation EVEN IF you were all for it. The leading character, the sniper, played with astonishing realism by Bradley Cooper, has to be all kinds of things to satisfy himself. This is a movie about a man who has something to prove, but also a duty to perform. His personal life, his marriage, his role as a father, is all compromised by this duty to do something he thinks he has to. And he does extremely well.Whatever you think of the politics (or whatever you call them) that go with the release of the movie, it's still a really conventional story, well told. There are no creative leaps, no unexpected insights, nothing to make it go outside that old box people talk about. So enjoy it for what is is, thoroughly. A pleasant experience.",7,6,20,21 March 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," Four great performances and a dazzling idea--skip the filler and enjoy the best
","The Devil Wears Prada (2006)There are four and a half major stars here, and any part of this movie with any of them is really fabulous. I'm talking Streep of course, and Hathaway who has the main role. Add Tucci who is terrific (as always) and Blunt who is also terrific (as always) and you have he makings of a terrific movie.So why the downer reviews and semi-dud status? I don't know, except the other parts without any of these, or with just Hathaway and her friends (her peers including her cute but dull boyfriend) are really dull stuff. This is partly the actors and partly the writing, which is truly filler. I can see some people grabbing their remotes at these points. But let's get to the crux of the movie, which is actually pretty great fun. The parade of great fashion that whizzes by, the haughty power queen that Streep pulls off with such panache, the steady dribble of insults coming from Blunt's mouth, and the transformation of Hathaway, over and over, as she moves her way into this world are all really dazzling. It's a fairy tale with its feet firmly on the ground--but what odd, worldly, glitzed up ground to be standing on. There are no depths here, just light romantic comedy. It's a situation many of us know--either by having to look good, or by having an impossible boss, or just seeing a relationship dissolve as you move on in your goals and maturity. Between the dreck there is a mostly wonderful idea made into an intermittently wonderful film.",7,2,3,4 January 2013
Romeo + Juliet," Dazzling, reverent and audacious at once, and a beautiful telling of a beautiful story
","Romeo + Juliet (1996)Spellbinding. Pushes hard at the limits of a contemporary kind of Shakespeare while still keeping all the intense rivalry and romance. It's sometimes awkward, improbable, and even ridiculous if you don't jump in and just go with it. But if this is at all up your alley in spirit or in a love of the original play forever finding new turf, you might just be blown away.I was. I saw it the first time late at night traveling and a bit bored and restless and from the first scene to the last I forgot the world and was twisted and pushed and amazed. You might be able to say any one actor--like Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo or Claire Danes as Juliet--is breathtaking, though many certainly are superb. What you find is the movie itself is the star, rapidly conjoining unlikely scenes and making individual contributions flare and sizzle in jarring succession. The filming, too--under veteran Donald McAlpine--is gorgeous and original without being distracting. Shakespeare deserves some credit here, taking a classic problem and turning it into an archetypal drama. The problem is just when two people fall in love from different sides of the tracks. The drama, of course, is the eventual suicides out of pure love. If you don't know the story and I've ruined the ending, I'm sorry. (I won't say who kills themselves.)See this? Yes. Yes. Yes. But be warned--it starts with such a bizarre boundary pushing adaptation of the classic confrontations in modern gang terms you might just say, woah, this is stupid and horrible. You really might. But if you can hang in there until you get the two title characters going, and get them to meet, you'll at least know how deliberate and creative the whole movie's style is.",9,2,5,5 May 2013
Gone Baby Gone," Nasty Realism in a Vivid Offputting Roar of Moral Dilemmas
","Gone Baby Gone (2007)Nasty Realism in a Vivid Offputting Roar of Moral DilemmasThis is a penetrating experience if not a transcendent one. This cinema-verite dive into rough Boston trashy life, with only limited filmic gloss, as if a kind of documentary, is still clearly fictional and intentional in its scope. These are mostly horrid seeming people on the screen, yet we know them in real life, more or less, and we know they are not so horrid most of the time, that people have their troubles and their strengths. The problem, and the value, of Gone Baby Gone is that we are made to live with them for the entire movie. Even the good guy, the moral light (more correct than his girlfriend) played by Casey Affleck, is rough by necessity. The violence of language, of attitude, and with real bullets, never stops.Or when it does stop, we are left with abusive parents, neglectful parents, child molesters, kidnappers, corrupt cops, drug kingpins, drug dealers, torturers, mindless murderers, and mindful murderers. I'm sure I've only touched on half of it, and yet we believe this kind of world is out there, and are thankful it's got limits, or at least that it doesn't brush against ours. Usually.Affleck's character is a contemporary and very young private detective, Patrick Kenzie, and he sort of proves that the cool, hard talking, slow-paced film noir detective is no longer a reality (if it ever was, even potentially). Our new world reacts with too much immediacy, and murder is impulsive. People are so strung out, or so far into criminalilty, reactions are fast and violent. Kenzie's unflagging, show-no-fear approach, and his kindly but somewhat dull girlfriend sidekick, Angie, are the closest thing we have to decency, and we naturally relate to them. But what proves successful is not wits, not CSI cleverness and science, but personal connections and tough conversations, threats and pressure of one friend (so-called) against another, one cop against another.The plot might at time seem to teeter, but hang in there, because it makes sense, even as it drops over the edge of probability. The twists keep you curious, but mostly it's the determination of Kenzie, driven by some need to succeed, to do the right thing rather than money, that makes you care. Oddly, I did care where he went with it, and worried for him. Affleck is the younger brother of the director, Ben Affleck, and the two of them seemingly have a rapport that centers the film. Morgan Freeman shows, by his sheer presence, what great acting is, and though his role is a cliché as a veteran cop, he pulls it off perfectly. Ed Harris, playing a more war-weary cop, is more complicated cliché, but with enough odd corners to his career, and enough intensity to his acting, we go with him the whole nine yards. One unsavory character, the young druggie mother played by Helen McCready, is at times so perfectly played it's part of the success of the movie. At first I thought she was playing too stupid, and too callous (being the one we are meant to sympathize with) but gradually I see the depth of exactly that kind of person, and by the last scene I'm convinced completely, and all her earlier crying and not-crying makes her the half faux-victim, half selfish addict she really portrays.What finally splits the movie is a moral choice that the viewers might make differently, and so ultimately the film goes somewhere beyond its own seedy example. And the ride there is really interesting and worth watching.",7,3,4,17 July 2009
Incendies," Gutwrenching, intense, beautiful, searing (yes, scorching)...
","Incendies (2010)Scorched is a good translation of the French title. That's how you'll feel by the end.This Canadian movie, based on a play by a Lebanese writer, is set mostly in Jordan and is a tale of a twin brother and sister (son and daughter) looking for their roots after the death of their mother. It's quite amazing.Don't think this is some feel-good flick. What it shows first of all, better than almost any movie I've seen, is the reality of life in wartime in the Mideast (pick your country). The ruthless, bloody, sectarian violence is made intimate in the worst way, or best way cinematically—you hate it, and feel it. This is the huge strength of the movie, giving light to the dilemmas of ordinary people trying to survive, literally, the mayhem.Equally important is how the daughter's view of her mother changes as she learns more and more about her. The daughter is forced to do this because of a request in her mother's will, but she takes it on, in a more recent Jordan, with utter determination.The movie is divided into two time periods. The first belongs to the mother in an ongoing series of harrowing flashbacks. The second belongs to the daughter, and eventually the son, as they look for surviving members of the mother's past. The steely force of will of the daughter turns out to be a mere shadow of the strength of her mother, and you droop in admiration and sympathy for all of them.The huge, dramatic hook of the movie, which you only learn as the characters learn it at the very end of the movie, isn't something I can talk about here. But for outrageousness it puts Shakespeare to shame—and it was for me also a distraction. Your jaw drops and you think, oh how awful (and more)! But a part of my brain was also saying, this is too much, it isn't contributing to the truth and emotional depth of these characters.It might even undermine them slightly, reminding us this is a stage play, an artifice.But that's a nagging quibble. This is really a powerful movie, beautifully rendered, and acted with unusual intensity. It's rough (realistically violent) in a few spots, but it's worth it. Wow.",9,7,11,14 January 2014
The Godfather: Part II," A stand alone masterpiece that is, deliberately, slow and epic
","The Godfather Part II (1974)Is this well made? Dramatic? Epic? Beautiful? Impressive?Of course.Is this better than the original Godfather? In some ways, yes. It lacks the originality of the whole world novelist Mario Puzo (and co-screenwriter Coppola) created, but it fills in background in Italy and adds wonderful new elements about immigration and the revolution in Cuba. It lacks Marlon Brando, who is a force of his own, but the presence of Robert DeNiro in the many long flashbacks is moving (and he has more presence than Pacino, frankly, who is intentionally stoic, but to the point of expressionless). Is it a great movie? Why not? What is a great movie supposed to do that this one doesn't? Well, for one thing, I don't think it surprises at all. It doesn't reveal anything too deeply, despite all its deeply felt and emotionally turbulent scenes, and despite the apparent inner probing of the main character (who is last seen thinking very hard, staring into space). It doesn't suggest how to feel about any of this violence, this cold duplicity. And maybe it shouldn't do any of these things. It is an oddly 'confirming' experience. It shows what we have come to think we already know, more or less, about the mafia world with its combination of loyalty and bloody revenge, its attachment to business and its selfishness, its emphasis on family even as it kills those in its own family.What Coppola does do, as director, is suck you in. You get wrapped up in the world of these men (mostly men, of course, though with a great small role by Talia Shire and a famously troubled larger role by Diane Keaton, who makes a better Annie Hall by far). You are easily and gladly transported from New York to Las Vegas to Miami to Italy back and forth, across time and space, in warm colors and sweeping scenes, inside and out. The pieces of this rather complex story are put together with 'artful' deliberation--it's a work of art, surely, despite its relatively straight forward intentions.It is also filmed, that is lit and photographed, with sensitivity, without becoming virtuosic for its own sake, by Gordon Willis. Part of the immersion happens because of how everything is depicted, and it's easier said than done to make it all cohere and remain beautiful.So yes, it's surely a terrific movie. It might not be one of your favorite movies, and it really isn't one of mine. I've resisted watching it a second time for two decades, and finally have, and found my mind wandering sometimes. This might partly be a testament to the imprint the Godfather movies have made on American culture and on the movies, because part of my distraction was that it's all so familiar. But it's familiar partly because it's so influential and convincing.But it's also partly true that there isn't a huge range of events here. I mean, a lot happens, but it falls mostly into a small diversity of power plays, deceptions, waiting games, and ruthless murders. It's all fascinating and terrifying on some level, but it all wraps around itself over and over again. You will find yourself understanding and even identifying with some of the characters, but you might not find yourself sympathizing with any of them, not the major ones, who are all (all) out for themselves in the end, or a pathetic followers yes men. In short, if you like this world and are fascinated by the male power aura, every second is filled with drama. But if like me this isn't really sufficient for over three hours of absorption, your mind might wander a bit, too. Cosi sia.",9,4,8,6 May 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," A solid spy vs spy plot, intense acting, but mostly just stellar stellar filmmaking!
","The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)The best of the big three Bourne movies. A have a soft spot for the first one because it was 'first' and it brought out the basic ideas fresh and with some grit and invention (as in the opening scenes). By comparison the plot here, the narrative, is actually more of the same, another spy movie.But so incredibly well done it's riveting. There are fight scenes and car chases, plenty and then some, but there is a lot of really intelligent pursuit on another level, on foot, not only of Bourne but of a couple of his accomplices. The camera then becomes a player, and the action, though fast, is absolutely vivid and discernible. There's no exaggerating the power of this kind of chase, as if you are there, first in London and then in Tangiers.It helps slightly if you've seen the first two movies, because a lot of the movie is out to 'explain' the mystery of this creation, this killing machine named Jason Bourne. Of course, this is a machine with a conscience, and his struggle for memory, and for self, is the soul of the movie. In this third installment he has some help, and some unexplained old feelings with, a woman in a pale echo of the first movie with Marie (who is mentioned many times here). And this helps give the movie feeling.There is a ton written about these movies, and about Robert Ludlum's three books that are the core of the plots here (for deviations, see the internet). Note there is no fourth book, and the fourth 'Bourne' movie—'Legacy'— is a decent wannabe without Damon and also without Bourne (as a character). The efforts of original director (Doug Liman) for 'The Bourne Identity' aren't to be underestimated, but it is partly his cameraman, Oliver Wood, who makes the movie delirious and rich. And when the director was changed to Paul Greengrass for the 2nd and 3rd movies, Wood was retained, and he helps (along with the actors) give the movies coherence. Greengrass earns his own kudos, though, for after doing a creditable but routine (and extremely kinetic) 2nd movie, pulls off this bit of movie-making masterwork. It's really something to study. It's a Hollywood piece of crap on some levels, of course, with lots of effects and a plot that isn't going to win awards for creativity. But it's so well done, and with enough touches of genuine human intensity, it works. It really works. See it even if you doubt it. And if you like this kind of movie, then you've already seen it.So see it again. I did. It holds up great the second time.",8,2,2,17 July 2014
Notting Hill," The best parts are warm and clever--the worst parts you can live through, so do it!
","Notting Hill (1999)At first I though this was going south fast--the narration by Hugh Grant as the intro got going was straining too hard to be funny, and taking too long to click into gear.But then it switched to a more usual romantic comedy, the kind that Grant has made his bread and butter (lots of both--he's really good at this). Later, when the narrative voice-over returns, it works just fine. He's the consistent charming low-key Hugh Grant that we've seen in many films before, and if you don't like him, you should steer clear. If you do, here you go!Of course, there's Julia Roberts, too, and I find her completely fine, the dependable Roberts who really can't quite 'act' but who is always likable and so acting isn't the issue. And to make it even easier, her role here is to be a huge mega-star actress. Which she already is. Voila, a perfect fit.The magic and romance that is meant to spark between the two leads isn't always convincing, but there is a sparkling kind of dialog between them, and among extended family, that keeps it going. There is some really sharp writing here.And there is some really stupid acting. The goofy roommate is just too goofy and caricatured for the rest of the cast, and he is given some of the weakest script to read, as well. The first appearance of Grant's family might strike you as forced, as well, but they gradually work their way into the film and are actually warm and very funny. I wish they had been larger and the roommate smaller in the plans.Director Roger Michell has a short resume, including a well-regarded 'Persuasion' which didn't persuade me (I like Jane Austen too much, I think). But there is a sensibility in that film that carries over here in some of the family scenes. Well done, as far as the script takes it.Don't expect a great movie. It's entertainment, pure and simple, but enjoyable, and with some shining moments.",7,8,13,14 December 2011
Léon: The Professional," Violent and touching at the same time--a beautiful stylized gem
","Leon the Professional (1994)A tightly wrought, ironically charming (and no so ironically violet) caper about an accomplished assassin and a sweet girl. The assassin Leon is played with dry, raspy wit by Jean Reno. He's one of those guys who's 'the best' without question, and who lives off the radar naturally. All he has is a suitcase and a potted plant in his small apartment. The girl, Mathilda, is played with a perfect combination of innocence and worldly savvy by Natalie Portman. When her family is wiped out by gangsters, she is taken in by the assassin, who happens to live next door.The bad guys are led by Gary Oldman, who is a caricature of an evil thug gangleader. And behind the scenes in the middle of all his is the inimitable Danny Aiello in a small but important role. All of this weirdly makes sense, and the plot moves along with our growing concern for Mathilda, above all. And then for Leon, by extension. So whether you call this a buddy movie or an over-the-top farce, it's so well connected, smoothly filmed, and forcefully acted it just feels and looks right. It's just superbly made.Director and writer Luc Besson is a marvel, really, and anyone who has seen 'La Femme Nikita' or 'Fifth Element' knows that he can show imagination and style with edgy contemporary punch. He's the main example of the so-called 'cinema du look' style of French movies, a kind of counter-balance in self-aware movie-making to Quentin Tarantino's more artificial style. Besson is essentially a writer first and director second, and he wrote all of these as well as the 'Taken' movies that have recently been so successful both in France and here.If some bloody violence doesn't put you off, add this to your must-see list.",9,8,9,5 June 2015
Bird Box," Entertaining end of the world stuff if you don't think too hard about it!
","Bird BoxDo not even try to make this make sense. Relax and go with the bigger set up, the feeling of helplessness, the dependency on friends and strangers. The high drama in a near-future dystopia (the favorite new realm for movies since 9/11).
Fairly quickly into the movie, something goes terribly wrong in the world, and for the few people who are not immediately affected and killed, the one hope is to hide. And hiding in various ways becomes the rest of the trip. Oddly, that creates enough suspense to make it work.
Sandra Bullock is key, a strong female lead. The surrounding cast (including a really good John Malkevich for awhile) helps keep it together. And the filming and pacing is really good.
But of course the premise of the movie is really its biggest point, and its famous weakness because there are just so many unexplained and unlikely aspects to the perils, and to the solutions, to make your brain happy. So shut off the brain and enjoy the ride.",6,1,5,9 January 2019
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," The best--Williams behind the mic--is 11 stars, but the movie as a whole is a kind of slick formula otherwise
","Good Morning, Vietnam (1987)A lighthearted but deadly serious anti-war film, actually. This is of course a Robin Williams movie so that it is his schtick, brilliant and inspired, that makes it soar. The best of it, including the famous riff when he first gets on the air as the new Saigon DJ, is hilarious and breathtaking. There is a plot, sort of, as he goes through a rise and fall at the military radio station, but it's more about his shining moments behind the microphone than anything else.The 'else' in this movie is, however, most of the movie. That is, Williams has a serious role as an offbeat renegade in a chaotic world surrounded by a range of sensible and very insensible officers and colleagues. At the most extreme, when we see a Vietnamese village firebombed while Louis Armstrong sings 'It's a Wonderful World,' the sentiment is so cloying it makes you cry, and you're not sure why because you know it's just over the top manipulation. Likewise when Williams is caught in a traffic jam with other military vehicles and he warms up the soldiers by humanizing everyone and making them feel like they really should be back home. Which they should be, as we know in retrospect.So the movie has another side that's kind of sentimental and simplistic, whatever its good pacifist intentions. Williams is a decent actor—I'm not one of those who thinks he's brilliant outside of his funny roles—and so it holds up pretty well. But the plot line keeps the movie from really finding pathos, or comedy, or warmth, or tragedy of a dramatic kind, in the scenes outside the radio station. And I think that's what it intended.For those who don't know, it's worth adding that the main character, Adrian Cronauer, was a real person, and still is—he's a staunch Republican (Williams was not, to be sure) and an innovator in radio in Vietnam. He also co-wrote the screenplay, I assume working on the scenes that he would know best rather than the larger saccharine plot aspects. A great story, and the real Cronauer deserves credit for inspiring it, and helping it along. He was, along with most of us, 'Godsmacked' when he heard the news of Williams's death.",7,16,19,13 September 2014
Watchmen," As an outsider to this world I found it amazing and a bit boring, both. Read on...
","Watchmen (2009)This is one of those could-have-been movies. It has stunning graphic effects, great gloomy urban mood, lots of wild and curious characters, a superhero plot laden with doubts and human angst, and some ongoing complexity that makes you pay attention.But there is also an ironic sameness to it all, a similar plodding through, with all the excitement and drama built in all along. There are two large goals to the events. One is establishing the details of a group of superheroes famous from mid-Twentieth Century America. They meet and they talk, but they talk a lot, surprisingly, when you'd rather see something happen. There are flashbacks, lots of them, and good ones, but the point of them is to fill in the characters, and to suggest some lingering personal problems between them in the past (including relationships that have gone wrong). The point of all this is not only to dovetail plot details, but to make the characters very human, whatever their inhuman powers.The second is a current problem in a fictional America, set in the 1970s with Nixon enjoying a third term (and Nixon, Kissinger, and some of the other players of those times make appearances). Nuclear war seem imminent. These retired or dysfunctional superheroes are woken up from their withdrawal from society (earlier forced out of service by a government decree) when one of their group dies (the one who dies, the Comedian, seems actually to be a very bad man overall, not a shining good guy). Something is going wrong, and it seems that these superheroes might be required to act, even illegally, to save themselves.If only their interpersonal squabbles weren't so heavy and damaging. If only they knew who killed the Comedian. If only there was some momentum in this gathering together the past and focussing on the immediate crisis. If only the director had not assumed every viewer was already familiar with the characters, and enamored with them the way you get sucked into comic book heroes.So even though you can't stop watching because it's so visually interesting, the movie gets ponderous at times, many times, and a little overly simple in its psychology and its Cold War plot. I had never heard of the Watchmen or the legendary graphic novel (extended narrative comic book) that precedes the movie. Diving in fresh, I make associations with superheroes I do know (a lot of them, from older comic books and the many movies in the last decade or two). I tried to learn the powers and flaws of this group (they are ambiguous, beyond their fistfighting prowess, men and women both). And there is the exceptional Dr. Manhattan who seems to have God-like powers, waving a hand and disassembling a tank in mid-air then crushing it into a ball of shards without moving from his stiff, upright position, glowing a nice blue radiation of some kind.And stiffness? That's a problem all along. As human as everyone is, they have a kind of cardboard or styrofoam acting style. Oh, I know they are cartoons, but still, emotion becomes suggested or told or acted, not expressed. I'm not sure if this is on purpose, keeping the effect like the emotions in a flat, fake character. (If you don't know comic books at all, picture the 'emotion' of a person in a Lichtenstein painting--it's a symbolic expression of something, not a real expression.)For me this is all fascinating but not as involving as I would have liked. I mean, if you compare to the obvious, like a Batman or Spiderman movie, you see a different visual effect in much of it, and it's distinctive and very smart and actually refreshing. But it lacks the propelling plot and the compelling characters, period. For me, as a novice to this world, which I assume many or most viewers can relate to. Still, it's really different, and worth at least a partial look to give it a shot.",6,4,9,28 September 2011
The Bourne Identity," Furiously dynamic, and if a little thin on substance, buttery with effect
","The Bourne Identity (2002)It's a slightly ludicrous plot and not a very complex one, but it's so well done, so fast and well acted, it just takes off and never stops and works great. You couldn't ask for a better action adventure espionage film without depth. Not only is Matt Damon well cast and doing his best, but his lesser known female unwitting but not at all witless companion is terrific, too. And that's Franke Potente (forever known best for 'Run Lola Run').The fighting (in slightly fast motion to give a comic book feel to it all, even more than a martial arts style) and the CIA backroom stuff (where they have to kill their own agent to protect their image on Capitol Hill) is all good enough for any movie. But for me, the thing that lifts this just a bit higher is the relationship between the Damon and Potente characters. The actors play it all very cool, show normal fear and confusion, and really demonstrate a deep trust in each other. By the ending, you are so happy for them, you might be sad to hear there are two sequels.Director Doug Liman seems to come out of nowhere for such a complex and well directed film, though his two earlier features, 'Swinger' and 'Go,' are both very strong. It's interesting that both the sequels received similarly rave reviews among the mainstream press, and both were directed by someone else (Paul Greengrass), which might point to the strength of the underlying story and cast. On the other hand, Liman set the tone and style of the following two films, and there is something superior about having done it first. This is a good film, and a great film of its type.The photography (and effects) are talked about here, and director of photography Oliver Wood shoots all three films, which shouldn't be overlooked, since these are such visceral, visual experiences. Guaranteed to not let you doze off. Good fun!",8,3,4,25 January 2011
Man of Steel," A great cast takes on 'Superman Begins' with CGI overkill
","Man of Steel (2013)The Superman story from the fall of Krypton to his first moments as a full grown Superman on planet earth.And there are some thrills, including lots of retelling of the familiar story—like how he grew up in Kansas and was raised by really good, salt of the earth parents to be a good guy. (I mean, what if he was raised by Paris Hilton?) Kevin Kostner plays the dad, and he is a kind of superhero himself for his wisdom and self-sacrifice, much like Glenn Ford was in that role for the 1976 movie, 'Superman.' In fact, there is a lot here that will be an homage to that groundbreaking movie.And often it doesn't compare well by comparison. Here, the special effects are more advanced, but they are also simply more. There is so much computer driven action stuff here, and often with such fast pizzowy cuts and big explosions, it's all about sensation. The plot is there, and at least you can tell who is who, but there's little of what you would in a better movie call choreography. A good cast comes to the rescue. Amy Adams is terrific in her straight forward role as Lois Lane, and the evil nemesis played by Michael Shannon is excellent without ever being exaggerated and ridiculous. And most of all, Clark Kent a.k.a. Superman is really excellent—and hot—as played by Henry Cavill. (You can argue all you want about who is better in the role, Cavill or Christopher Reeve, but you need to see both movies first. I have and I leave it a tie because each fits the personality of the movie he is in best.)There are some raving good reviews of this movie and I don't blame them, but I'm guessing many of them have never seen earlier Superman movies. Not that the 1976 version is better—it has a similar bag of tricks and parallel flaws—but that the plot in this new one is not new. If you've seen the other movie. So if you are looking for some surprises rather than a series of reminders, you won't find them here.Except for the one big one that the enemy is from, well, you'll see soon enough. But what that means is lots and lots of high tech (and not always very well done) computer effects. The falling buildings are brilliant, and the set designs on Krypton are amazing, and they take up a large part of the movie. Some of the folksy warmth of the earlier movie is missing here, which I miss—they don't even reprise 'faster than a speeding bullet' and all of that, which is kind of archetypal.Christopher Nolan had a hand in this production but did not direct it, but on the horizon for 2015 is a tantalizing title, 'Batman vs. Superman.' Let's see how that plays out with his superior movie-making intelligence. For now, this is a halting and sometimes numbing entry point.",7,4,7,13 January 2014
The Color of Money," A good ride, colorful shooting (camera and pool), but a bit thin overall, except Newman.
","The Color of Money (1986)The reputation of this films rides partly on its director, a mainstream Martin Scorsese, and on the previous film it bounces off of (and makes vague reference to), The Hustler. Key to both films is the astonishing Paul Newman, who holds his end of the stick and then some. The rest of the cast is purely in canned and competent support roles, or in semi-star roles by two young actors with some screen presence but no great subtle skill to match Newman's. I'm speaking not only of Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio, who is forced to play the slightly tough, slightly sexy, generally submissive girlfriend, but also of Tom Cruise, who is brilliant at being 'flakey' partly because he is in real life, from all accounts. You give Scorsese credit here for using the young actor in a role that matches his natural persona, in contrast to others, including Spielberg, who seem to make more of the actor than there is, and a certain falseness gets in the way. But this film uses the awkwardness and naive, boyish qualities of Cruise as a sudden pool shark really well. What holds it all back? I think basically plot. I mean, it's fun to see the big hustle at play, and to get stung once or twice when things aren't what they seem. But we sort of know going in that that's the general plan, and then it happens. And it takes a long time happening...there are no (no) complications here, beyond pool and hustling. The romances, for what they are worth, a completely thin, and didn't have to be. The settings, all these great (great) poolhalls and small town joints are terrific, populated a little too perfectly by locals of all different stripes. The camera-work makes some fairly cinema verite footage make sense in the scenes, but not with either edge or lyricism. This all sounds a little like I'm working hard to point out the flaws, and I must go back to where I started about Newman, and the basic strength of the aging pool player facing a change in his personal scenery. It's a canned affair overall. Well done, sure, but without the richness of the best of Scorsese's work, or the best of Hollywood, for that matter, including the preceding The Hustler, which you might see in a pairing with this one.",7,11,16,10 April 2010
Trouble with the Curve," Trouble indeed--with the movie, with the writing and direction most of all
","Trouble with the Curve (2012)It might be that Clint Eastwood deserves credit for growing old less than gracefully, stumbling a bit, his eyes fogging, and insisting on being a chauvinist even with his talented daughter (played by Amy Adams). His role here is not especially attractive, though it does carry the typical touch guy attitudes that are essential to his character (and seen in other recent movies where he stars such as 'Gran Torino').However, this small, predictable tale is not directed by Eastwood, and I'm amazed to hear myself say I wish it had been. It would have lifted it up a little, at the very least, and this needed all the help it could get. Several stellar actors and a theme as warm and fuzzy as apple pie are wasted here in what is a simplistic, linear, disappointing exercise. So who is here? Wow, take John Goodman and Justin Timberlake as secondary characters. Both play 'themselves' to a large degree, Timberlake squandered the most by making him a restrained pretty boy and little more. Throw in Adams in her main role, a bit hampered by some lame writing but chipper enough. She is meant to be damaged goods from a bad childhood, and has put career (as a lawyer) over happiness. You know this will crack one way or another.And then Eastwood as the driving force even as he is supported, almost literally, by these other three. As a legendary baseball scout with a 'feel' for the game, including its sounds and subtle hints of talent and flaws, he is the opposite of the main character in 'Moneyball,' Billy Beane, who used computers to assess baseball talent. Unfortunately, 'Moneyball' came out one year before this one and is a first-class movie top to bottom, making 'Trouble with the Curve' even more insufficient. You might even think this was a cheap try at cashing in on the interest in the theme.The fact is, the theme--judging baseball talent in human ways--is only superficially explored, and then mostly in the last part of the film when the other themes have taken front seat. These other aspects are equally thin, however--an obvious and thin romance, a reconciliation between daughter and father (with no real work, just a need to fill out the script), and finally a redemption in the old ways of baseball. The end to the movie, which I hardly need to disguise, is pure, sappy, stuff that makes even 'Field of Dreams' look complex and realistic.Skip this one. If you like baseball, you'll want to skip this one even more. I love the game and found this belittling and cheap. And a lousy movie.",4,5,9,17 September 2013
Split," Covers some familiar 'captive female' territory with professionalism, nothing more
","Split (2016)An interesting movie with some 'dumb' aspects, like many horror films. The good part is how we see the villain (with multiple personalities) is slowly revealed through videos and a therapist. It's unlikely, of course, but actor James McAvoy makes it vivid and fun. And believable in the movie.The three teenage girls are made to be mostly clichés (one of them much less so) and in case you are wondering, yes, they end up miserable and in their underwear by the end of the movie. This is a horrible shame because it cheapens the whole thing, and the complexity of the McAvoy's character makes it unnecessary. I'm also tired of movies where innocent females are imprisoned by crazy men, with all the ugly power trips and sexual fear involved.There are some slightly superhuman aspects that get revealed (I think writer/director Shyamalan probably thought this was 'really cool' and if you wonder about him, go see some interviews on youtube). It's fun, of course, but to me not the brilliant inventive movie some others have said. If you know any of Shyamalan's other films, you might quickly characterize this one as a lesser one (like 'The Village') and by that you'll know that there are some really fluid, beautiful aspects to the movie, and some conceptual flaws that get in the way. But still enjoyable entertainment, so weight it accordingly.",7,2,4,4 August 2017
American Psycho," The originality and craziness almost compensate for the awkwardness throughout
","American Psycho (2000)This isn't quite a dark comedy, not a satire of psycho slasher movies, and not a straight up suspense crime flick, either. Or is it all these things?It might depend on your sense of humor. If you try to take it seriously, which you shouldn't (the first clue is in the credits when the dripping blood turns out to be a red sauce for a fancy meal), you'll end up mystified and unhappy. If you find this funny, if Christian Bale in this pre-Batman demanding role is really wry and comic for you, you'll love it. Most of the time. I was somewhere in the middle. Bale is playing a caricature--the overly rich and conceited playboy businessman in the Reagan 80s. But he plays too often the caricature directly rather than letting it come through the performance organically. Sometimes this is fine, or even great, but it puts a little strain on other scenes. (The women I know who saw it or have seen it don't think this matters so much because he's really hot, and really naked, in lots of it. And it's directed by a woman, Canadian Mary Harron who cut her teeth, not surprisingly, with the artsy 'Who Shot Andy Warhol.')The plot is important and clever, and hard to talk about because there are some key twists, the twists becoming really huge by the end. Appropriately. Because above all this is camp. It's hammy without being slapstick. It works best, in a weird example, with the recurring fascination with the business cards among this group of young pampered business jerks. Jealousies over the color of the paper and the quality of the type lead to, well, some unrestrained behavior.The movie is sometimes bloody for sure, but most of the blood is so gratuitous it isn't quite disturbing. The main character is insane as the title implies--more than you realize at first--and the people around him don't always see him for what he is. Or do they? Or do we?There are a lot of movie tricks here. Scenes shift reality, or echoes from one situation visually resemble another, and in that sense it's a smartly made. But it also manipulates too openly for anyone trying to actually enter the movie. And 'entering' the movie is a mistake. It's all show, and once you realize it's a farce and the characters don't really matter because they don't really exist (it's just a movie, the movie insists), once you realize that you're going to enjoy it more, but also realize it's a capped off experience. It only goes so far.By the end I wanted it to end. It's an odd, affected, curious, and almost period-defining movie. If you liked slightly odd creepy moves like 'American Beauty' which has an odd echo in the title, you might want to give a go.",7,4,6,29 July 2012
Little Miss Sunshine," Totally joyous, funny, fun, fast, and more mainstream than indie overall
","Little Miss Sunshine (2006)What a wacky, funny, sweet, feel-good movie. It's fast, well made, well written, and fresh faced all the way through.What else do you need from a warm comedy? The star has to be the little girl, who is in fact the title character, Olive, played by Abigail Breslin. She is the real deal, a great little kid with a heart and with smarts and cute and talented, too. And for some reasonable reason she wants to compete in a beauty and talent contest, and her loving and doubtful family give her total support. Of course, the genuine things that Olive represents are the exact opposite of what is encouraged by beauty pageants, so a kind of crisis is inevitable. But you know it'll be a funny crisis, and not quite like the comedy in the adult version of the film from six years earlier, 'Miss Congeniality,' with Sandra Bullock. Because Bullock has the goods to win, despite her outsider sensibility. Olive is set up to be a geeky, cute but not a bit glamorous or fakey kid.Her grandfather, played by Alan Arkin, is also the real deal, a nutty caricature, for sure, but funny and a great perk in the movie. The parents are fun but for me in a more expected way, and the brother of one of them is fun and funny in a Ben Stiller kind of way. Production involved some quirks in filming, such as the use of five different yellow microbuses, and the genuine use of headphones by the little girl (as shown) when Arkin is swearing his head off. And the whole thing was a fairly well budgeted indie with a debut at Sundance. And a huge rise to the top of critical and popular charts.So it's easy to like this movie and even to love it. For serious movie lovers you might find it like other feel-good, well made, but in some ways 'in-the-box' movies (another that comes to mind is 'Shawshank Redemption') so it won't strike some people as exceptional. Just exceptionally fun. Don't expect anything truly moving or thought provoking or experimental or probing. It is what it is, which is pretty much self-sufficient.",7,3,4,13 May 2013
North by Northwest," At last, the new releases bring the visual brilliance up to the heights of the script and acting!!
","North by Northwest (1959)Perhaps a perfect movie, and a perfectly Hitchcock movie. This has great sets (including a mock up copy of Mt. Rushmore and the real United Nations exterior, shot by stealth from a car). And it has three great performances from two great actors and an actress who rises to her best for this demanding role. This would be of course Cary Grant at his middle aged peak of handsome easy charm, James Mason at his middle aged peak of handsome easy charm (and very different), and Eva Marie Saint, nearly a decade after her searing appearance in 'On the Waterfront,' very much a mature woman, alluring and yet knowing. You can see this is an adult film, by and for adults, including the very adult Hitchcock, who seems to be having the time of his life making it.The plot itself propels, scene to scene to scene, as if we are in on the chase, and yet it stops for some genuine laughs, hilarious moments snuck between the layers of cold war chill. That seems a contradiction, in a way, since this isn't at all a comedy, in the normal sense. And there are some sexual innuendos that were subtlety working around the fading Hays Code rules, and that now seem like pure brilliance. It's a smart, bubbly, entertaining mix.Some people don't get Hitchcock, and I get that. I love his films more and more over the years. 'North by Northwest' is characteristic of his willingness, even his insistence, on keeping the artificial edges to the movie visible, the clearest example being the runaway car early in the movie, and the famous chase over our dead white presidents at the end. It's as stylish and entertaining as a movie can be, from the costumes (Grant's legendary grey suit and Saint's gorgeous dresses, picked up at Bergdorf's) to the interiors (not only the painted backdrop of the U.N. building but Grand Central, a couple of famous hotels, and a classic stuffy mansion).You can moan when Grant's character, Mr. Thornhill, grabs the knife out of the man's back, or you can notice the out of order backdrops out the window of the train (it moves from sunset to late evening to sunset, and the bridge appears and disappears in a blink). But that means you're in it for the wrong thing. (In the first case, you want him to grab the knife, because that's the classic mistake in thrillers. In the second, you're supposed to be watching Grant and Saint in one of the sexiest understated dialogs of all movies.)Yes, I like this film. It is, above all, likable. It's brilliant and all that, too, but when it comes to just enjoying watching a movie, this is top shelf.",10,2,3,10 September 2010
Knowing," Slowly builds to an unexpected end...pure Hollywood stuff
","Knowing (2009)Slowly builds to an unexpected end...pure Hollywood stuffKnowing is terrific and terrifying, and it has some of the best disaster effects you'll ever see. But it's not brilliant or even original, though the plot has its own turns and specifics to make it distinctive. It uses so many familiar sci-fi/thriller/horror tricks to shock us and make us pay attention, you might feel as manipulated, and helpless, as I did, but you might also get swept along and have a great time.The plot, which I have a rule against describing, is more crucial to the development of the action than many movies. Nicolas Cage is really fine as the lead scientist/dad, and in a very usual Cage kind of way. If you like him (which I do), I'd say you'll like the movie. The kids hearing voices and the building sense of doom are necessary and entertaining--if that's not too breezy a word for a heavy heavy story. Because it is all dependent on this 50 year old prophesy, and about how to decode it, and then, alas, what the heck to do about it. In some ways it devolves into a standard catastrophe scenario, with Cage holding his end of the stick very well. The scientist he plays faces his atheism and watches it evaporate with dry resistance, very nicely.The really disappointing gripe is how poorly the concept is handled in terms of science and math and general likelihood. The numerology just isn't convincing. In some ways it's so simple and historically based, it's dull (and excessive) once you get the point. But having the information and then running around in a frenzy isn't exactly what you might expect. Furthermore, the solar flare idea is conceivable, but not presenting with a kind of scientific reasonableness that would give the movie credibility. Even the way the trailer has been abandoned for years and never vandalized doesn't match my experience of the back woods.But then, maybe it just operates as a what-if kind of fantasy, with a holy-cow ending that will gag the most dreamy-eyed of you. They could have left the last minute off entirely...but you might disagree completely. If you see it on a plane (not likely) or in a motel, it's perfect distraction material, gripping and exciting. The first big disaster (you'll see) is so realistic it gives me goosebumps remembering it.",6,2,5,6 September 2009
Hugo," A fantasy, a children's dream, and a very adult appreciation of a brilliant filmmaker
","Hugo (2011)This would have been my vote for Best Picture for 2011, especially if you limit the voting to nostalgic visions of silver screen history. This sort of does exactly what 'The Artist' does, paying loving homage to early movies, 'Hugo' is so much more imaginative, filmed with overflowing ingenuity and fluidity (it is a Scorsese movie I know), and it pays respects more directly and beautifully.Yes, this really is a love letter to the first decade of mature movies before 'Birth of a Nation' and full feature films. Here we rediscover the short cinematic (very cinematic) inventions of French filmmaker Georges Melies. Never heard of him? Well, that's why you should see this movie. At times it almost plays like a fabulous documentary (to its detriment as a movie, but to the benefit of Melies), so you do learn quite a lot about this man. And it's mostly accurate. Things that get stretched for the sake of the movie are reasonable enough. (By the way, a little known reference to Melies, charming and beautifully done, occurs in the otherwise flawed 'Klimt' and is worth watching just for those scenes.) There is a feeling that this is a children's adventure, but even more than 'Where the Wild Things Are,' this is a movie for adults, and kind of about adults, too. The two leading kids--a girl and a boy--are terrific but in that child actor way where they fill their roles perfectly (not like, say, the slightly older Judy Garland in 'Wizard of Oz'). The adults are not quite caricatures, and make the film have a lot of depth, but they are kept in check by the children's storytelling aspect to the whole enterprise.Whatever the limitations there, it's the filming, the sets and costumes and moving camera and special effects, always kept in check, that make the movie special. If you are interested in the also-rans of the Oscar season, this is the first to see. If you want to just have an enjoyable bit of escapist and light hearted filmmaking, this is a must. And if you are curious about Melies, there is no better place to start.",8,14,20,24 March 2012
Judgment at Nuremberg," Gripping, layered, beautiful, eternally pertinent
","Judgment at Nuremberg (1961)A widescreen black and white blockbuster from the cold war years, with so many stars at their dramatic best, it's a thrill as much as a horror to watch. A thrill because Stanley Kramer has directed this cast (Clift, Garland, Widmark, Tracy, Lancaster, Dietrich) with such finesse and high drama. Horror because it makes so clear the atrocities of World War II in Europe.There is documentary footage at the core of the film--views of the terrifying destruction of the city as seen just after the war, and actual concentration camp footage that will curdle your blood. And also at the core of the script, and the overall feel of the film, is a documentary truth. The trials really did occur in the city of Nuremberg, Germany, in 1948 and 1949. The Americans ran the judicial aspects because it was in the American sector of occupied Germany (Spencer Tracy is the presiding judge, brought in from Maine for the eight month ordeal). In the background is the contemporary and explosive crisis of post-war Berlin itself to the north. Berlin, the largest city, was in the Soviet sector, but the city itself was divided into four parts among the allies. If you don't quite follow the map and strings toward the end, it showed the famous Berlin Airlift. Because the Soviets closed off the roads in an aggressive attempt to claim all of Berlin as their own, the other three allies started flying everyday goods (from coal to food) to the city in an ongoing and expensive determination to not let the Soviets get away with it. Eventually access roads were reopened through East Germany, and Berlin remained accessible. The final evidence of this Soviet toughness was the Berlin Wall, not built until 1961--the year of this movie, and probably not a coincidence.All of this makes this three hour movie essential viewing--historically critical, visually terrific, amazing acting. But what gives the thing larger appeal over the decades is a bigger and trickier theme. How much is a criminal government and evil military the responsibility of its citizens, both the ordinary folks and the ones higher up in power but no directly responsible for the worst crimes? The four men on trial here are jurists from the Nazi years. They claim they had to go along with the regime or lose their jobs, and maybe worse. Some claimed they tried, from the bench, to soften the Nazi unfair and inhumane laws as best they could--better than if they resigned in protest and moved to America. But prosecutors argued that everyone has to maintain a legal and moral truth, that sending people to their death or to sterilization is a crime, no matter what the pressure from above. Watch to see how this man from Maine decides what kind of morality is truly just in the long run, in the big picture. The movie might look long on the poster, or on the package, but it will be gripping all through. It's a rare one.",10,2,3,24 February 2010
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Great idea, great sets, pretty straightforward acting and action flick stuff
","Terminator 2 (1991)In terms of movie-making, this second installment is clearly a smoother, smarter, more professional product. It's rightfully admired as better, in some ways, that the first in this epic series. Like the Star Wars movies, the first installment excels for sheer story introduction and originality (and I'd throw Hunger Games in the same mix). Once the depth of the success took hold and some money was applied to the second (and third) movies in the sequences, the quality naturally rose. And so 'Terminator 2' is a better, more solid production.But it's derivative. Sometimes the scenes are deliberately echoing the first movie, which is understandable, but then other scenes just seem like a lack of originality. There are a couple nice shifts of plot again as you get used to the idea that the future is meeting the past, but really it's kind of the same thing all over again but better. One thing that doesn't improve is the acting—both Arnold S. and Linda Hamilton are pushing the limits of their abilities, and their credibility. I have to say Hamilton is much better this time around, playing both the sympathetic mother and future hero but also a crazy person really well. Which also helps give the movie a little boost. It's also nice to have Schwarzenegger around for the whole movie, including the finale (again in a factory, like the first movie).For me, the bad cyborg was too all powerful—the effects were astounding, but if you have a guy/robot who can pretty much do anything you wonder why he doesn't at times just kill people and take care of business with a quick one two. The vulnerability of Schwarzenegger in this film is a welcome contrast, and it makes him almost, well, human. The plot has progressed over the last seven years well, and we are ready for the third installment—which is part of the idea. Well done, as far as it all goes. Fast, energetic, clever, with great sets and effects.",7,2,5,9 February 2014
We're the Millers," Family redefined. Along the same old lines. Funny!!
","We're the Millers (2013)Okay, this seems like just another goofy comedy, but it's pretty great. It's funny, has lots of fun twists, and some good comic lines. But more than that, it creates a kind of intimacy and sense of real family (a sense of it) that makes you realize what family is all about. Yeah, unlikely, I know, but it works. When the two 'fake' parents start to act like real ones, it's funny but also moving. Who woulda thought?It's hard to say who pulls this off—clearly the 'parents' are terrific, Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis. And the two kids are pretty good too, if clichéd. But what makes it all happen is the breezy comic writing. The basic set up is filled with clichés, and you have to like corny humor to really enjoy the play on these. So there are drug lords and immigrations officials. There are dorky RV tourists and clueless bystanders everywhere. But kick back and don't' expect too much and be surprised.And don't miss the bloopers in the final credits. Among them is a great moment where they play the theme to 'Friends' on the RV radio, and it seems to catch Aniston by surprise. Group admiration.",7,22,28,19 December 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Some great new twists on a familiar against-the-odds romantic comedy
","Silver Linings Playbook (2012)A great drama/comedy, both funny and moving, with terrific acting from a terrific cast. What more do you want? Ah, maybe a little more originality, an ending (and a dysfunctional family) that wasn't a twist on 'Little Miss Sunshine,' something a little less sentimental?All of these things. And yet, with misgivings intact, the movie is still great in its own way. Part of the reason is some hard, true acting. Both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are spot on believable, funny, and fleshed out beyond stereotypes. The rest of the cast, including De Niro as the Cooper's father, are simpler characters and yet the types they play don't quite become stereotypes. In fact, the three men (the dad and the two friends) are superb within their roles. It might be Lawrence who sets the movie on fire most, even above Coopers volatile, yet tightly bound, performance. Lawrence is a kind of freed version of what Cooper must play, and she's more fun, less troubled perhaps, and utterly optimistic. Which brings up the point of the movie.Beyond the plot of a pair of young people struggling with common forms of mental illness that require medication but allow for fairly normal lives, there is the larger point of rising up, of being positive, or making things happen by wanting to and following through. This is the moving part, the part that makes you love and identify and even envy the main characters as they show how to succeed within their malaise. It really is a common thing to face a mental flaw that brings your life down, or someone you love. And here is how to deal, how to try to deal.Yes, this is pure Hollywood, without suggesting its happy ending in any detail. It lacks what someone like, say, Cassavetes would attempt in this situation (and the result would fail to reach a larger audience). But it has some brave aspects, making real a situation that needs some understanding without turning it into unmitigated nightmare.Director and co-writer David O. Russell has a leaning to films that mix high drama and real human and interpersonal concerns. This might be his best film ('Three Kings' is worth seeing for its mix of serious and comic aspects to war, and 'The Fighter' has qualities of sadness and persistence that echo here), and it is one that sets his direction as a more serious, interesting Hollywood director. See this.",7,3,4,20 June 2013
The White Ribbon," A beautiful, long, troubling, and dry experience, Germany a generation before the Nazis
","The White Ribbon (2009)A brave, intense, complex, nuanced movie. It's got an edge of Ingmar Bergman to the quiet, rural, psychological edge to it, but it's also a big movie with lots of characters and a social theme fitting, somehow for German culture, or so it seems from here, New York.There are issues here that are daring for any movie--child molesting, patriarchy run wild--but it is put so thoroughly in the context of the 19th Century these themes are weirdly shocking. That proves if nothing else the persuasiveness of the movie and its mise-en-scene.Another brave aspect to the whole enterprise is the filming, in tack sharp black and white. This isn't the shadowy, silky, dramatic black and white of classic Hollywood of the 1940s, or of film noir, but a more precise and technically clean monochrome. Shadows are dark but with great detail. Highlights sparkle without washing out. It's a thrill to watch, and it gives every scene a documentary clarity and beauty that's bracing. And in keeping with the film's contents.There no question at all that many people will find this slow, obtuse, overly detailed, and even banal between all the short sensational moments. And the narrator might be wearing more than the voice of a reminiscing old man. But if it does click for you (and you'll know in ten minutes, for the pace and flavor does not change, beginning to end), you'll find a very delicate, razor sharp sensibility that is fresh, and refreshing. I can't say I loved the movie as a narrative experience--as a story, as a long two hours of immersion. But I did love aspects of it without reserve. This alone makes it worth watching at least part of. That's kind of a condemning suggesting, to watch half of a movie, but once you start you'll see what I mean. And it isn't giving anything away to say that the movie doesn't resolve everything by the end. All the loose ends remain loose ends, which is wonderfully disarming as much as it is unsatisfying, both good feelings, and rare ones. The acting is intensely serious, the sets and costumes have authority, and the tenor can't be anything but legitimate for the times, just before WWI.",7,2,5,10 January 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," It's long, it's intense, it's abusive, it's fascinating, and it has some acute acting
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)It's hard to just take this movie straight up--it's a very close and really excellent remake of an excellent and probably slightly more incisive Swedish original movie by the same name, and based on a book (three books actually) that a lot of people have read. But in one sentence, let me try. The newer 'Girl' is a tightly made, well seen, well acted, beautifully situated historical crime drama hampered by a little too much complexity, leading to too much explaining and not enough plain old happening. The best of the film is brilliant stuff, fast and vigorous, compelling as much as the first version. The worst of the film repeats some problems of the first version, including abuse of the characters that borders on the sadistic. A couple comparisons will help even those who haven't seen the 2009 film. Daniel Craig is a more handsome and a bit more polished an actor than the Swedish leading man, Michael Nyquist, but Nyquist is frankly more believable, more Swedish (of course), and a genuine original.The two women who play the title character are an interesting parallel, their names even with odd echoes--Rooney and Noomi. Rooney Mara (a New Yorker with a pretty good accent) is the 2011 girl with the dragon tattoo, and her tattoo may be less impressive, but her intensity is in place. She gives the movie its ultimate edge. Noomi Rapace, a native Swede though of mixed background, has some edge in personality, a slightly quirky violence and a more believable detachment from people around here, going beyond simply refusing to shake anyone's hand. Rapace's performance is completely memorable, and as good as Mara is (and she is really good), Rapace is better--more distinctive, more beautifully awkward, and even, in the end, more convincing. Check it out--the first movie of the Swedish trilogy only, however.There is something frankly weird about Fincher's whole enterprise when the Swedish original is so good, and so Fincher-esque already. Yes, Fincher adds more atmosphere, including some very 'Seven' inspired rain and music (Trent again, with a Led Zeppelin twist over the astonishing and deflecting visuals in the opening credits). But what really is to be gained by remaking the movie so soon, and with such little original input? It's almost a grad student exercise with a superstar's production budget. (The answer, sadly, might be that they wanted to cash in on the phenomenon of the trilogy before it was too late, remembering the American public's aversion to movies with subtitles. It has made $100 million in profit so far.)So we end up analyzing Fincher's 'Dragon Tattoo' indirectly. It was made to echo the Oplev version from just two years earlier, and it does. Scene by scene, you'll find overlaps, and interesting shifts, and there must be a web page out there that compares the two movies. For me, having seen each movie once, the really big differences are: 1) a more taut, spare (and Swedish?) relationship between the two leads in the first version, which is really the core of the movie beyond the sensationalist Nazi/rape/money plot, and 2) a highly different ending in both feel and significance (which I won't give away).Let's say you haven't seen either film. What to do? Well, if you love Fincher already, you'll want to see how he's doing. But if you want a movie with a little more space to it, a little less glitz and a little more honest intensity in the characters, see the Swedish one. If you see both, which isn't really necessary (they're incredibly similar), you might note the American version cost $90 million to make and the Swedish only $13.",8,7,13,8 April 2012
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," I get why people might love it--but funny isn't always that funny. Oy.
","The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005)Director Judd Apatow has his finger on the stupid side of American culture and can make you really laugh about it. But at the same time, you might groan and wish you could escape. I know I did. It's a taste thing, partly (each to their own) and an age thing, too. The humor really is aimed at people in their 20s (or younger), working out relationships (and sex) in an adolescent, bathroom humor way. Getting drunk is cool, and having sex is pure sport, at best.Of course, the main character, Andy (Steve Carell), doesn't do either one, which is part of the humor. The plot has a long arc, taking us from the realization (from the title) that Andy is forty and still a virgin, to a bunch of guys (very male guys) trying to get him to have sex in various ways, to Andy finding a real relationship (this is laid out in the very beginning, too). There are no real surprises here. Even the connection between Andy's toy collection and ebay is visible after a few scenes.What makes (or breaks) the movie is the series of funny situations and jokes (clever, stupid, and gross in turns). Different people laugh at different jokes, and a few are going to be funny for almost anyone, if you last that long. It's a smart film, for sure, just with dumbed down jokes. Carell is terrific, and a sympathetic character, and the actors around him are convincingly post-pubescent men, good actors all around. This might be enough if the humor is your speed. And Catherine Keener is really natural, a joy on the screen, and an obvious contrast to the goofy antics of the rest (all the rest, men and women both).As a 'movie'--which for me is partly about how it sucks you in and makes you feel things, how it is shown visually, how it is interwoven from front to back, how it leaves you feeling the next day--it's very very routine. Apatow comes out of television sit-coms and this feels like an overblown and expensive sit-com. Which means it's slick and funny, but not too slick and not too funny. Depending.",5,1,3,15 June 2010
Face_Off," What outrageous over the top excess, without apology. See it!
","Face/Off (1997)An overcharged, comicbook flavored kind of doomsday scenario with a huge twist and more action than two hours can handle. Terrific to watch, even if it's preposterous and filled with superficial glitz. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are both terrific as themselves—and as each other! No doubt this kind of trading places story could have really interesting psychological depths—and that movie is waiting to be made—but here they choose to play up the sensational aspects (sleeping with the other's wife, etc.). And that's exactly what this movie demands. It's all about excess. And fun. If you take it too seriously, you're too serious. It's seriously funny and almost joyous, even as lots of people get unceremoniously killed. Even the ridiculous first scene, which goes on a very very very long time, is all about outdoing James Bond in outrageous chase and shoot-em-up scenes.If the movie lacks class, or wants some subtle aspects here and there, or even needs strong female roles, there is a kind of deliberate pedal to the floor aspect here that is perfect. Perfect. Chinese born director John Woo isn't known for subtlety, though I haven't seen his Chinese films. But he melds well with Hollywood's larger style, and here is the result, a must see.",8,3,6,3 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man," Totally enjoyable competent and been there before...
","The Amazing Spiderman (2012)What do you do with a movie that's impeccably well made, acted to the pitch required of a superhero movie with realistic themes, and filled with really fluid wow factors? I mean, this is a really compelling movie on some levels. And if you like these kinds of movies (and there is no shortage of them every year) this is one of the best, technically, and from the point of view of unaffected acting.What no one wants to say or hear in this context is that the movie isn't everything it could be. Or even worse, it's everything that other movies have already been, including earlier Spiderman movies. Marc Webb isn't at fault--he directs with aplomb, and gets the most from the series of action scenes. It's the writers, and the producers who are guiding the writers, who have to take some rap in presenting another movie about the same kind of thing we've seen too too many times. Or at least too too many times for me, for singing praises.But if you don't mind the formula again, you'll be in for a treat. I know I enjoyed it all even so. The swinging through space, the life or death fights with a hugely powerful monster, the last minute race to stop the doomsday device (with a timer to let us know exactly how much suspense lies ahead), the girl who is smart and pretty and actually pretty capable, too. All of this is in place, and well done.Well done. Is that enough? Up to you. It's hardly the kind of movie the invites deep thinking or parsing out the components. It's more the kind of movie to just rush in headlong and enjoy, and drive home thinking about something else.",7,3,6,14 July 2012
Aliens," A functional plot built up with the most vivid and beautiful and demonic effects
","Aliens (1986)I had a revealing experience these last two days. I heard 'Aliens' without watching most of it (I was in the other room). And the script is really really bad. I mean stupid bad, with these quasi military people fighting against the monsters and saying canned military things that are taken not from real army dialog but from other movies. The events really boil down to a series of missteps, and even though this band of Marines is made of tough 'hombres' sure enough, they can't seem to get along, or get things done, or even hold their overly heavy weapons up straight.I did watch for part of it, and I have seen the movie more than once before, and I'm a fan of the first one, 'Alien,' from 1979 (on the heels of the 'Star Wars' craze). I expected it to be pretty good, like the first one, which has real character development and an original kind of premise. But...well, think again.Hey, I agree with most--the set design, the sense of action, the light and camera-work, the whole larger than life experience of being in this forbidding place, this is all great. Even the over the top 'movie music' is appropriately symphonic and big. There's no way around the fact the movie is well made, and feels convincing in these palpable terms. It looks great top to bottom, and even on contemporary terms (we are a quarter century later as I write), it is sophisticated. It has aged well. If that were all that mattered--and for some it might be!--then all is well.But for me, I was still thinking there might be some interesting, chilling plot to follow. This second installment, always confusing in its plural title 'Aliens,' is filled with a combination of stale ideas (taken politely from the first round) and romping action adventure boy stuff. It is if more intense than the first (more fighting, more firepower), but it's far less creepy. It has more goo, and more gore, but less horror, and less fear. As with the original, the lead character is a woman, and indeed a whole bunch of the Marines are women, and so this is no simple manly movie. But it remains a macho movie, or a 'machisma' one, and that will suit many viewers fine. But if you are remotely interested in the science fiction aspects, or even the terror of the first movie (which was truly terrifying), you might be disappointed to find you are continually battered instead. It's great battering, but if you actually listen to the dialog (when there is any--the best parts of the movie are merely sounds), you'll see what I mean.James Cameron, the director here (and not the director of the first one, which is credited to the more original Ridley Scott), does the famous Cameron thing, playing a kind of 'Star Wars' game of making an epic suited for about a 17 year old. Not that older people (and younger) can't enjoy it, but movies have their target points, and that's it here. You can see it in the dialog and plot, of course, but also in the overall feel of things, which is a combination of early computer games (1986 is a long time ago in those terms) and swashbuckler classics. It's a vivid, fast movie.You will notice, in retrospect, some 'Avatar' features that are interesting, beyond just Sigourney Weaver. Foremost, this is a military affair, very right wing, go-get-em stuff, but with the admirable (American) rise of the individual above the chaos of both internal logistics and the logic of the evil outer world.The monster? Monstrous. The famous designer H.H. Giger is not involved here except by carryover from the first. It's a good thing he was the originator because the basic visual and sculptural quality of the monster, the planet, the ships, and the sets, is under Giger's brilliant sway, and is a defining quality of the film. It makes no biologic or engineering sense, but so what? It looks great.In all, clearly, there are amazing things here, taken on their own level. But there are discouraging ones, too, for those who are willing to pay attention. The little blonde girl at one point says, 'Mommy...I mean Ripley, I'm scared.' And Ripley (Weaver) says, 'I know, Honey. Me, too.' That's the core of it all. Don't forget your grenade launcher.",7,5,7,24 March 2011
Dallas Buyers Club," A searing look at a sliver of important history, and two superb acting jobs
","Dallas Buyers Club (2013)What starts as an interpersonal drama with Matthew McConaughey leading the way, ends up as a more hard-hitting social message film with historical roots. It's about survival, accountability, American entrepreneurship, and AIDS. And McConaughey as Ron Woodroof is quite perfect, an amazing role played with a perfect mixture of restraint and excess as required.It's necessary to mention as a secondary play Jared Leto, who plays a transgender woman, Rayon, also with AIDS. Woodroof overcomes his apparent homophobia to embrace Rayon as a partner and friend. Playing this kind of 'type' might seem easy—like playing a racist sheriff or a grumpy old man—but Leto makes it complex and fair to that kind of person. (By the way, Rayon is fictional and Woodroof is not. The main story is true, including the making of a buyers club based on a model in New York that skirted laws for awhile.)This is a movie ripe for praise and criticism both. It digs into an important subject and turbulent time. It also creates simplified versions of the people and their circumstances. Cries of inaccuracy (especially against the hospital, which is portrayed as pawn in the pharma corporate world) are fair but don't let them distract you. This is a drama, a dramatization, and it's well done to the heels. Beautifully rendered and truly filled with drama.If the two actors deserve the most credit (and by extension the leading woman, a doctor played by Jennifer Garner, does not), the director needs to singled out here for capturing the feel of the times and the place (Dallas, filmed in New Orleans) so well. It's never distracting with affectation even as it is always interesting and colorful. And the story is told well and fast and without unnecessary sentiment.",8,5,6,6 February 2014
Control," Sam Riley astonishes, and moody late 70s Manchester is convincing...
","Control (2007)The first thing that should strike someone familiar with Joy Division's music, and with movies about rock bands, is how low-key and unglamorous this film is. Instead of plowing into a bunch of music clips, or dwelling on drug use and brushes with early fame, Control focuses on the lead singer, the charismatic and troubled Ian Curtis. This is a movie about a bunch of ordinary seeming kids, each with their small quirks and sometimes rather small (but sufficient) talents, and about how they get through that first series of layers toward becoming a successful band. Shot in gorgeous, crisp black and white, and centered in a middle class Northwest England (greater Manchester) in the late 1970s, it is both serene and gloomy.Sam Riley is undeniably the core of the movie as Curtis (the more famous Samantha Morton plays his wife well, but has a smaller role). We vaguely know what will happen by the end, so it doesn't just parade facts as the band wins fans and gets bigger gigs. It peers into the mind and actions of a gifted songwriter and idiosyncratic punk and post-punk performer. Riley manages to recreate the aura of Curtis, especially in these scenes early on where they are playing in obscure places with small crowds, and this is really hard to do, since pop music stars become legends in part because they have some special presence in the world, some quality that makes them stand out. But Riley manages even better to show the brooding, lyricist side of the singer. It's a must-see performance, subtle and convincing and singular.Is this a way to learn something about Joy Division's music? Not really. And that's just as well. Go to iTunes for that (their first two albums are the core of it). The movie isn't about music, but about relevance, and how to take some ability and quiet drive and break out of the doldrums of life. It dips into the era with such believable and restrained simplicity it's a revelation. Yes, it sometimes flags, and sometimes seems to have only the one long, complicated thread, with a given outcome, and so it isn't an inventive, swirling work of fiction (the facts have it trapped) nor a masterpiece of ensemble acting (which it isn't trying to be). But it's about as good as movies about music and musicians get, and it's a beautiful, remarkable journey about one man caught up in it all, and in his own struggle for decency and significance.",8,3,4,15 February 2010
Now You See Me," Wow, such pizazz and showy stuff, and such a thin veneer of a plot
","Now You See Me (2013)The entire movie is about pulling wool over your eyes—as clever as you might be, you'll never figure out what's happening. So you just have to rush along for the ride. And quite a ride it is, filled with legerdemain and fireworks, sleights of hand and feats of prowess. People disappear and people get out of and into handcuffs with one frame of the movie camera. You want to look one way but the camera looks the other and wham, another surprise.Yes, it's the movie the wins, without quite succeeding as a movie. It's like someone winning at a game by cheating. Impressive—not! And yet it seemed like fun for awhile.There is quite the starry cast here, though two of the biggest stars have only a few minutes (literally) of screen time, sprinkled throughout the film. Michael Caine is shown as the money man behind the hiring of the four magicians in their sudden rise to the top. And Morgan Freeman is shown as the hunter of magic charlatans. (And no, there is no connection to Batman here.)The four magicians are kind of a Dream Team pulled together in the first twenty minutes of the movie, and at first you think you'll see more of their individual acts, which are kind of fun. And different. One is a shyster on the streets, another a kind of trickster mind-reader hypnotist (played beautifully by Woody Harrelson), another a showy big production woman, and the fourth a wizard with cards. After they get together, however, it becomes a version of 'Oceans Eleven' with magic thrown in. The big sham even starts in Las Vegas.If all you want is pizazz, this movie is for you. It's nothing but! And it's quite well made technically and very fast paced. But if you want to get in on the tricks and be not only surprised but also held in suspense, there are too many easy twists and tricks of cinema illusionism at work. In fact, a key problem with magic in the movies is that you can't quite believe it because you can't trust the camera-work and editing. And there are certainly many tricks here that are only possible by splicing one piece of film to another—you know that seeing it on screen, and just have to say, 'It's a movie, it's okay.'One final element is the convincing, hard-boiled detective, played by Mark Ruffalo. He seems to be the dependable thread a viewer can cling do amidst all the swirling and disarray. A necessary element. Never mind his Interpol sidekick from France, which is meant to add a love story to the whole brew. This movie isn't a mess. It's just a shame because it is so close to having the stuff of a great (entertaining) movie. Even so, though, it's quite entertaining. Quite.",6,6,10,25 November 2013
American History X," Gripping and intense, and Norton is fabulous enough to rise above the clichés
","American History X (1998)Well, Edward Norton is so astonishing, and almost scarily convincing, you can overlook a lot of the well worn themes that guide the plot. In fact, all of the acting is strong, especially the little brother to Norton's skinhead character, an up and coming skinhead played by Edward Furlong. The movie is covers basically a 24-hour period, but a good half of the screen time is flashbacks, presented in black and white to great effect. Not only does this help us keep track of what we are watching (the different lengths of hair help, too), but it adds pure style to what is basically a violent crime and prison film. It's fast, well edited, and filled with powerful social imagery and gut-wrenching interpersonal scenes.Crime and prison life form the backdrop for the two main things that give the movie depth. The first is obvious, maybe--race issues between blacks and skinhead whites in Venice Beach. It gets painfully oversimplified, maybe out of necessity in less than two hours, but it works well enough. The second is more important--the love and mutual admiration between two brothers. They are just kids, really, though Norton's role is very adult by the end. Their interactions are the best thing the movie has, and luckily they permeates everything, beginning to end. Clichés in this kind of world might be inevitable in this kind of mainstream movie, but if the African Americans are especially cardboard in their depictions, Norton's portrayal of justified racism really chilling, and the interactions within his family complex and revealing. The other Hollywood plot elements are things you just have to go along with. The kinds of good guys and bad guys, suffering mother and angry sister, the prison culture and street culture, and even the use of guns everywhere are not far from some Italian-American mobster movie, and I suppose that's partly just the truth of it. But it also seems a little easy, a rewriting of a common set of circumstances.Too common. Which is part of the point. You sometimes wish there wasn't a message to every movie like this--American History X is heavy on the moralizing--but the message is a slam dunk. The movie will leave you reeling.",7,2,5,8 January 2010
Jackie," A slow, forced fit of a lot of amazing historical stuff into a psychological pretzel
","Jackie (2016)This is such moving, important material, historically and emotionally, it's hard to separate the movie from the subject of the movie. You might appreciate the movie just for its bravery, going into material that is by necessity subtle. And uncertain. What really did Jackie say in that week after her husband's assassination? And more importantly, how did she say it?This brings us to Natalie Portman, who is everything here. She tires, she gives a difficult role a lot of focus. And it's not completely her fault that the performance ends up being stilted, or unconvincing, or you might say incomplete. She must have studied Jackie's mannerisms, but that's not really a way to excuse their exaggerations here. Slight exaggerations, but this is a movie about subtlety and conviction.The other historical figures are oddly cast—and I know it's an impossible job trying to cast JFK or Bobby, or even Johnson (who is more convincing when Bryan Cranston does it). And where was Ted? All of these things wear the movie down.The writing and direction raise questions. They are solid here, for sure, but they also contribute to a slightly lugubrious feeling. It's slow. It forced its obvious weight on us. Chilean director Pablo Larraín may have the disadvantage of not having lived through it (and not being from the U.S., even). Yes, there was a Camelot, and maybe it was created deliberately, but idealism doesn't come in cans. But back to point one—this is moving, important, amazing material. It is almost worth watching for that alone.",6,1,2,4 June 2017
No Strings Attached," A weak, weak light comedy with a wasted Portman in the lead role
","No Strings Attached (2011)You expect more than you're going to get here. There are two strong leads, Natalie Portman at her finest relaxed self (seeming) and Ashton Kutcher in a slightly amusing, self-deprecating mode that is a little dulling but fits his part. But there isn't the necessary conflict here to make their attraction take on fire. They drift together, they push apart, they find each other again, and so on, all mildly engaging and a bit sleepy.And don't expect much from Kevin Kline, either, mostly because his part is small and a bit canned, a caricature dad with too much to prove. The rest of the cast is frankly just functional, and you start to look harder at why the movie fizzles with so much apparent talent, especially Portman. And the only real answer is the director, who is more a producer at heart, Ivan Reitman. You can't fault the success of some of his movies, but it's an uneven bunch, from 'Ghostbusters' to 'Kindergarden Cop.' Something lacks energy and imagination here, and the writing stretched a bit. Enjoyable? Somewhat. Be warned, it's not funny, romantic, or energized enough to quite make it on any score.",4,25,32,14 March 2013
Inside Out," Great fun, often creative, but also a bit plastic and dumbed down at times
","Inside Out (2015)Totally fun, with some semi-serious analysis of how our brains work for a kid to absorb. And heck, maybe some adults, too. The story of a girl adjusting to moving to a new city and a new life is layered with a fanciful view of psychology. It's good stuff.I didn't find it as mind-blowing (so to speak) or inventive as many seem to, having read a few reviews out there. The clichés here are expected and almost necessary (the types of people playing aspects of personality, for example). So that's fine. But the larger story of adjustment is painted in very ordinary ways, hitting the usual trigger points without much creativity. I'm not talking the in-the-brain stuff, which is totally great in a Bugs Bunny kinds of great crazy way, but the outside story.I also don't really like this kind of animation—it's not as cartoony as, say, two of my favorites, 'Monsters Inc.' and 'The Incredibles,' both by Pixar. And it's not over-realistic as some animated/CGI inventions are (from 'Avatar' to 'Polar Express'). So the characters (the daughter and her parents, mainly, but everyone, top to bottom) are kind of plasticky fake/real. The personalities also have that Disney kind of white-washed blandness that seems quaint on the surface but is empty and predictable and a bit off-putting at the same time.I enjoyed this movie and it would be hard not to. And maybe this kind of children's film, or young adult film, should be aove serious criticism. But if it does warrant critique, and comparison to other animated features, it falls short. That's fair enough. Finally, it does have some totally brilliant moments, especially when it shows the insides of other people's (and animal's) brains. Notice how the audience really (and finally) comes awake and laughs with a roar at this! Now that's great filmmaking. Too bad it's just a few minutes of the total.",7,3,24,6 August 2015
Gone with the Wind," Amazing in nearly every way--with an insidiously racist undertone...
","Gone with the Wind (1939)What to say after thousands of other reviews?First, see it. See it big. It has so many different kinds of scenes, such terrific color and photography, and is dripping with so much history come alive it is a thrill and a joy. It's just a really really well made movie.The acting is superb. You might not think about this since it's such an 'old' film and it might automatically be old-fashioned. But it is not, not with the two leads above all. Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh are justifiably revered for what they did here. Leigh in particular works her butt off making scene after scene come alive, with horror and frivolousness and charm and passion. The story is great by itself (based on the book which was the best selling novel two years in a row). It's not about the Civil War and its aftermath, even though that's prominent (and vividly, memorably). It's about a woman who is so self-absorbed in her infatuation for another man she misses out on true love. Some of the side characters are amazing.So yes, a great movie--but one that bothered me all the way through for its handling of African Americans. I may have noticed this years ago but I don't remember being so disturbed by the constant stereotyping. The slaves are naturally uneducated, so I try to overlook that as simple truth. And the black actors who play the three or four main parts are astonishing, all of them. Hattie McDaniel won the Oscar that year for best supporting actress.The problem comes more from what all the white people say, or don't say, and what they don't do, over and over. There is no sense of shame, or apology, or perspective on their position as land owners and slave owners. Not before and not after the war. All of them, except Gable most of the time (he's a worldly and modern Southerner), mourn the loss of a great civilization, one built on slavery. They are so unabashed about this, and so many people say it, from Scarlett herself to the man she is infatuated with (the admirable Ashleigh) to all kinds of older and younger folks. Even the blacks are shown not in rebellion or joy at their release, but as slaves eager to fight for the South.The more I think about it the more it's disgusting. Now the answer to my complaint is probably that this is from the point of view of the South and so it's true to their perspective. And I think that might brush over some of the attitudes some of the time. But where are the slaves dying to be free? Where is a single voice of dissent among all the huge cast? Where are the Northerners with dignity and higher morality? (On this last point, when the Northerners appear after the burning of Atlanta, they too are shown only from a bitter Southern point of view--all of them, black and white, are opportunists and arrogant, selfish, 'un-civilized' sorts.)I teach a beginning history of cinema class and so see a lot of movies from the whole century of the art. And it's painfully weird that the two lionized, epic, breakthrough films about the Civil War are both from the Southern point of view. I'm talking 'Birth of a Nation' and 'Gone with the Wind.' And both are insidiously unfair to Blacks, one more subtly than the other but true.I'll end more cheerfully. Knowing the movie has this quality doesn't prevent you from enjoying it for a million other reasons. I laughed (it's very funny) and I cried (it's very moving). And I was endlessly impressed. Taken in perspective it's still a fabulous fabulous film.",10,6,10,27 January 2013
Legends of the Fall," Beautiful, yes, but overdone and absurdly epic to the point of embarrassment...
","Legends of the Fall (1994)This movie looks and feels good, and it goes far. However...It ends up being an overblown, simplistic epic sprawl, redeemed by Brad Pitt. It is filled with scenes of high drama, and some of them are truly moving—mostly sad and tragic. But there is a long string of clichés here, as if real human depth is reached through excess and borrowed ideas.The war scenes (WWI) are so fake it's painful. Yes, there are bombs and terrific lighting, but the acting, and the reactions to fighting and dying, are stripped of any truth and honesty. Likewise, the conflicts between the brothers are oversimplified, and the one young woman in the movie, the siren, is admirable (and the actress is terrific) but so symbolic it's just pure sexism. Anthony Hopkins plays the patriarch of this family with three sons and this newcomer woman. The local Native Americans add a 'Dances with Wolves' element that sometimes is a relief from the overdone drama, but often it too fulfills clichés. WWI intervenes. More clichés.Okay, I hated this movie and yet—trying hard—I liked the look of it. The director, relatively inexperienced Edward Zwick, seems to know movies better than life. It reminds me (in this way among others) of 'Shawshank Redemption' which I also found filled with simplistic solutions to interesting human problems. (I'm sure this will get some thumbs downs for this review—go for it.) Put it like this—if you like sentiment, if you like to feel more than think (which is not a bad thing), and if you don't really analyze movies but prefer to just experience them uncritically, this might really be a moving and terrific experience. And Brad Pitt is terrific. Final note—the music is overbearing. I suppose this fits the grandiose themes overall, but it was so saccharine and heavy it pushes the emotional aspects very hard. Hey, look, this is an emotional film and filled with heartache and unbelievable tragedy. If you can turn a blind eye to all the contrivances that make it happen, you'll be okay. If not, run fast.",6,21,37,26 March 2015
District 9," Wow. Hilarious and unsettling and deeply original. Cat food anyone?
","District 9 (2009)Aliens in Johannesburg. A lot of them. And humans, without the usual fear of invasion from outer space, but a more normal fear of those who are Other, just plain different. What do you do with a million uncouth strangers who can't even speak English? Exploit them of course, and put them in a giant tent city. And make them victims of a modern bureaucracy, too, and ask them to sign papers for their own eviction from a squalid camp they never asked for in the first place. I'm surprised they didn't think to tax them, too.Yes, this is District 9: inventive, preposterous, crude, grandiose, silly, disturbing. In spurts and surges, with talking head experts and creaky sci-fi effects, District 9 downright crazy, too. Above all, though, it's a relief. It isn't a Hollywood version of the same clever idea, and though I might like to see that slicker, and probably more sentimental movie, this one is a rare divergence, valuable for its diverging. Unlike many European films and their sibling American Indies, this South African production aims high, and big. And it pulls off some happy combination of absurd and profound in an entertaining, unpolished hybrid. It creaks and groans are unfortunate, and the plot could use some depth, but the whole situation, and the suspension of believability required, are fabulous.It's worth saying, at the start, that the monsters (of which there are an unreasonable 1.8 million during the main part of the movie) are unappealing, grotesque, violent things, vaguely human in shape, but eating raw goats heads and, their favorite treat, cans of can food (including the can, it seems, or at least without a can opener). But if this is enough for some viewers to wish them all dead, or at least wish them all to go home, it doesn't seem to bother the human population. Maybe this looks like small potatoes compared to Apartheid, a parallel lost on many younger and most outsider viewers. But the crux of the movie is the apparent kindness of humanity to help the aliens in their time of trouble (their spaceship broke down).The plot doesn't quite devolve into a good guy bad guy movie, though there is a particular bumbling, lovable hero at the center of it. It does resort to half an hour of chasing and shooting toward the end, with lots of effects not far removed from a contemporary video game. The fact that you are rooting for the aliens by then should strike you as odd, and in fact it might strike you as a parallel to a truly Hollywood movie with similar threads (stereotypes of aliens and macho humans battling for survival), have you heard of Avatar? But give this one a chance to get to you more poignantly (with less of the sweeping oh my effect of more expensive movies) and you'll maybe get what's good here.",8,3,6,8 February 2010
Batman Begins," Great, fast, myth-making, beautifully filmed...a Nolan movie about Batman
","Batman Begins (2005)I saw this for a second time last night as kind of homework before seeing 'Dark Knight Rises' and it is a marvel of movie-making, for sure. It's also filled with crazily exaggerated legends and it gives depth to many characters who have become as important to Batman as the evil enemies he faces. It has a few sections that are expository that slowed it down, but not for long, and some of the action scenes are astonishing technical feats.This is the first in what has turned out to be a trilogy, and it begins at the beginning, much like movies have done for Spiderman and Superman. Besides being far-fetched (the ninja fighters training our wandering orphan in some mountain retreat are the same ones who sacked Rome, etc.), it at first creates a different kind of movie, less about fighting evil than developing the skills and psychology to be superhuman. And those blue poppies they inhale--well, they comes into play later, too. So Bruce Wayne gets initiated, returns to Gotham, and slowly gets his equipment compiled, much of it stuff concocted by the wily and reassuring Mr. Fox, played by Morgan Freeman. The butler, played by Michael Caine, is in on the secret duality of our man from the start, and helps him in both practical and moral-boosting ways. It's all exciting and yet warm at the same time. You really wish there was such a Batman, with friends. Where the movie thins out, even as the action gets increasingly over the top, is even the slightest logic to the plot. You really have to just say, okay, this is a comic book world, and there really might be a plot to destroy Gotham simply because it's reached its peak of civilization. And there really might be a little machine with enough microwave power to vaporize the entire water system of the city. Just go with it.Certainly we have no trouble believing Batman can come and go like magic, glide with beautiful memory fabric wings, and shoot his rescue rope (like Spiderman) into faraway nooks. We all want to do this, and Christopher Nolan, the director, makes it dramatic like few others have. As many have written, this is the second best adventure hero movie ever. That might be true--there are a few others in line in my book--but it is probably easier to agree that the second in the trilogy, 'The Dark Knight,' is better than them all. But this led to that, and it's a great movie for this type. I mean, there are different kinds of movies that might leave you moved and even changed afterwards. Those are great movies. This one is a great movie experience, pure unapologetic entertainment. With lots of human moments and enough depth you can even watch it twice. I just did, and it worked.",7,3,4,21 July 2012
The Chorus," Troubled youths find inspiration in music--familiar turf but beautifully rendered
","The Chorus (2004)How many French movies will there be that are about boyhood and innocence lost? (Including great films, like Truffaut's 'Pocket Change' and '400 Blows' and Louis Malle's 'Au Revoir Les Enfants.') Out of this national necessity (and the admission of the first-time director) comes this rather nice if not quite great movie, building on the same foundations. A teacher is newly assigned to a country private school for troubled boys. He is secretly a composer, and finds a way to write choral music for the boys, who learn to sing extremely well. And so in the barest most touching way we see the vulnerability and possibility of the boys and the teacher, too. And of course the meanness of the schoolmaster. It's classic great stuff so well done you don't mind the familiar ways it works on you.Well, I have to now say that this movie is a kind of remake of a 1945 French original, 'La cage aux rossignols.' Even the title (The Cage of Nightengales) shows a poetic brilliance that is somehow just lacking here, but in the 2004 version the production values are higher, and the slightly deadpan quality of the lead (Gerard Jugnot) is compelling. Either way the story, and the simple truth of it, is worth seeing. (By the way, 'The Chorus' is easily found streaming and on Youtube whereas the 1945 version is hard to find.)Beyond the charming idea of delinquents becoming choirboys (and one of them later a famous conductor, which you learn in the first scene), the movie has a kind of warm confirmation that people can be good, and that appreciation of love, and love itself, always abounds. The last scenes will prove this, if you give this a go.What finally holds this film down to earth is not the acting or the music or the wonderful setting in post-war provincial France. It's the story, which we've seen before, and which oddly takes no new turn at all here. It doesn't mean it's not a good story or a well made movie, not one bit. But you'll know when it starts pretty who the good guys are and the bad, and how it will more or less turn out. In that one way, the original at least is, well original.",7,1,1,18 June 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Frivolous and visually astounding, fun and funny and still restrained
","The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)Stunning at every turn, and yet...well...it lacks something, too, that left me happy but unsatisfied.As usual with a Wes Anderson movie, the amazing sets and set design win the day. Sometimes this combines with a little magic in a movie to lift the result up beautifully, as in 'Moonrise Kingdom' (which I loved). Here there are certainly moments that work but many others that simply reside. The main character played by Ralph Fiennes is wonderfully proper and funny.Plot? A forced fairy tale of a story keeps the narration moving through several distinct parts, but the main idea is that an old man is explaining to a younger patron of the dying hotel how he came to own it. And those events happened to him as a bellboy back when the hotel was truly grand. The fact this is narrated is part of the package, but it keeps everything at that distance Anderson prefers.What it lacks oddly is magic, the one thing a fairy tale like this demands. There are lots of deliberate (and good) clichés at work—a stolen painting, a mysterious patron, an unexplained death—and there is the scene itself, this glorious old hotel both in its seedy later years and in its heyday. And though there are delights, and witty lines, at every turn, there is a feeling of just watching it, never quite getting involved. Maybe that's deliberate, but if so, it still left me a bit restless at times.What about all the stars in this overpacked cast? Well, you can tell they are in it for the pleasure of it, taking on comic book kinds of roles. But there is a disappointment there, too, because too often it seems that each star appears for their own sake, and her or his fame, not for the edge it gives their character. The most obvious case is Bill Murray, who appears in a dull role for all of about 20 seconds of screen time. At the other extreme is Willem Defoe, who is delectably evil all through in his major role. Jude Law makes a decent foil (listener) to the narrator, played well enough by F. Murray Abraham, but both men never shine. They sit and talk, after all.And so it goes. Which takes us back to the sets. Wow. Unbelievable at every turn. The hotel is superb, and likewise the expansive mansion of the murdered woman, and likewise even the train car which appears more than once. It's a wonderfully made movie on all these technical levels, including some flashy, tricky photography that is playful in its wide and then close views. See it? Sure, if you are predisposed. There no hating this movie, for sure. Which is high praise.",7,4,9,7 June 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Should you choose to read this review, heads up that it's no slam dunk
","Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol (2011)There's no question this is a well edited, dynamically filmed movie. And the personalities are important--the characters, and the actors, too, for fans (for example) of Tom Cruise.It's a great ride, a great thrill ride, but I don't think it's a great movie by any measure--unless relentless chasing and twisting from the enemy is the goal. The special effects are good--some of the scenes with Cruise climbing the tallest building in the world with some magic sticky gloves are flawless--and the normal scenes in gritty places ground these and give it all context.The plot, for what it's worth, is sort of predictable, over the top stuff--the bad guy (and girl) is going to blow up the world, more or less, unless the good guys (and girls) can stop it in time. And in good classic fashion, the clock is clicking from the get go--something like 36 hours to doomsday.What does the movie lack? Well, originality is one. That's not something to brush off--a movie like Iron Man or even (going back in time here) Raiders of the Lost Ark have an element of the fantastic that makes them unique. Among the supposedly grounded movies that still play games with reality, like the recent James Bond or Jason Bourne films, you still feel like 'Mission Impossible' is stuck in some kind of re-tread rut. The other drawback is characters. Alright, they are buddies, and they have a camaraderie that's great, and some good come-backs. Nothing is terrible. Still, the good guys are formulaic types--the one thing that keeps you interested in them, as characters, is the one addition who is unknown and a wild card. The bad guys are pretty boring, unfortunately, and this might be the killer problem overall. The bad guy has to be someone you really hate, someone you think is distinctive in their evilness, someone that makes you perk up and watch. Think of the evil-doers in 'Die Hard' or 'Spider Man' or 'Batman' (take your pick). Director Brad Bird pulled off some kind of magical coup with 'The Incredibles' and you can actually feel the lingering effects here--the great small talk as the world is going to pieces, the believable normal people facing huge odds. And that's good. Tom Cruise is up to his usual form, or actually he's more buff than ever, but he acts in the usual way, which I find a little plain but it isn't bad. See the first, second, or third version of this series (yes, this is the fourth with Cruise), or see 'Minority Report' from the same era, and you'll know what I mean.Anyway, I enjoyed the movie, saw it on the big screen with good sound, and was taken in by the wow of it all. I just wish I was also made to care a little, to identify with someone, to take it further than a joy ride.",6,3,9,26 December 2011
Foxcatcher," Too slow for many, but the patience pays off--Olympic pressure redefined
","Foxcatcher (2014)Based on fact, a movie about Olympic wrestlers training at the estate of tycoon family du Pont near Valley Forge. Even though it's about sport and sports at the highest level, this is the opposite of an action movie. The central figure is mean to be one of two actual Olympic level brothers who wrestled in the 1980s, but in a way the tone of the movie is dictated by the patron, wealthy heir to the du Pont fortune, John du Pont. He's played with impeccable, disturbed restraint by Steve Carell.The brothers are of course important, and slightly different in their makeup. Mark (played by Channing Tatum) is seemingly simple, almost slow, and he gets sucked into du Pont's plans rather easily. Dave (played by Mark Ruffalo) is more savvy, an older and more experienced wrestler.. And easy going, a family man who everyone likes. Except John du Pont.Don't let the patience fool you. Carell is uncanny—his performance seems to be a non- performance, but it never flags. Tatum is right on with his feeling for an athlete devoted to his ability above all, but missing the larger picture. Ruffalo, though in a small role, ends up the most sympathetic character, and by the end, if you agree, you'll be in tears.You sometimes wonder about how Olympic athletes get their support and what the price is to them personally. Though a long way from Communist bloc versions of control and abuse (and obsession), this is a perfectly horrifying and insidious American counterpart. Not to be missed if you like sports, sports movies, or the Olympics on any level.",7,3,4,19 June 2015
Lawrence of Arabia," Stunning in so many ways, grand and intimate and surprising!
","Lawrence of Arabia (1962)Funny, but this epic masterpiece starts with a bit of clumsy direction, an almost (almost) corny motorcycle crash. And then the movie begins in more earnest with the rise and triumph of the title character. The production values seem to never flag from the moment we arrive in Africa (shot in Morocco and Jordan, mostly), with embracing scenery, huge casts of extras (and horses), unusual levels of excitement that seem historically about right, and some intensely wonderful acting.This is a gutsy, highly polished British movie from the end of the great Golden Age of this kind of great dramatic style. The story is fascinating and grand, and the scenery is absolutely one of the central points throughout. You get sucked in and swept away with all the huge wide and often silent desert landscapes. And most of all, the story is astounding. It's about a man who is exceptional--a real man, not Bruce Willis in some office tower.Peter O'Toole is at his best here. David Lean, the director, seemed to know how to keep him both rebellious and restrained. (If you see a later film, like 'The Ruling Class,' you'll see a typical overcooked performance from O'Toole, equally remarkable I suppose but less finessed.) This portrayal of the daring British military officer in the Arabian desert is not meant to be perfectly factual (there are lots of battles about the facts, online and even in the opening scenes of the movie), it's meant to be moving and historically significant, and historically close enough.And it's personally impressive. This is a story that takes place on two main levels. One is the man's new understanding of the politics of the mideast in the 1910s and 20s. The other is the man himself, this wild and cunning and sometimes fearless and sometimes almost insane man who is able to adapt to Arab life and enter its problems from within and yet still remain thoroughly British in his attitudes. It's quite something to see, and O'Toole makes it believable more than you'd expect. If you met the real Lawrence of Arabia you might object that he's not playing his part quite right.The movie also has lasting importance as the Arab world (or the Middle East as it is still called) goes through more political change. It makes what Lawrence accomplished all the more profound. You might say that if he hadn't done it someone else would have, that the rise of Arab power we inevitable. Maybe. But that's not what happened, and this is. In a way, the whole movie is about Lawrence trying to unify the Arabs. His goal at first is to defeat the Turks who are occupying Arabia, but it eventually becomes more personal. He identifies with the plight of the Arabs but never quite becomes one.There are things that bring this down to earth a little, especially the playing with clichÃ©s (the photographer is good but sort of patched on, and some of the Arab characters are thinly sketched). But there is a host of wonderful actors, the one true Middle Easterner being Omar Sharif (he's Egyptian by birth, and he's quite good here). The other main ones are such good actors you don't quite remember they are English to the core--Alec Guinness and Claude Rains (quite old here, but still wonderful). Anthony Quinn (originally Mexican) is really good though his fake nose needed some better color--a weird thing for them to mess up on in a hugely complicated movie like this.Most of all it's O'Toole and more O'Toole, appropriately. A penetrating, original, almost possessed performance within a gorgeous, long but not too long film.",8,2,5,4 March 2013
It Follows," Visually terrific, but the basic idea is marshmallow nonsense
","It Follows (2015)Turbo review: great photography, lame premise. So it fits in with lots of lower budget horror films, scary and a little stupid at the same time. For some it will be scary enough to not matter—that's the point, right? And the cinematography is really very very nice.It's also a male-gaze movie. Meaning that it has lots of young women with few clothes and the camera staring at them. Not sure if director/writer David Robert Mitchell is still working through puberty (his pictures show him very young, so it's not a stretch), but I found it a bit insulting and unnecessary. It cheapens the whole thing, even though it's a questionable quality of lots of horror films to demean the women in the story.What works least is the main idea: some kind of force, not purely psychological, makes the victim see some kind of changeable person follow them. Everywhere. But always on foot, like a zombie. But with strangely fast and dangerous powers, too, whenever the scene requires. There is no rationale for this, no history, no nothing—it just happens to be the premise of the movie, and so there you have it. Let down your guard and like it, or question it (as I did) and get annoyed.The acting is not bad, but that's putting it on some kind of low budget horror film scale. It's meant to be 'normal' and it is, with some uneven performances. What does rise above is the visual panache, which is wonderful. It might actually be low budget, too, but it doesn't matter—cinematographer Mike Gioulakis makes the most of his digital camera rigs and over-the-top (not quite naturalistic) lighting. It's almost a requirement for students to watch for how to make the most out of simple equipment. Nice!You'll have to decide whether this saves the movie. For me, there were just too many holes.",5,4,13,28 August 2015
City of God," In terms of movie-making, there's nothing like it.
","City of God (2002)A broiling, gruesome, vivid, unforgiving submersion in the drug and crime world of a Rio de Janeiro barrio. You want to just say wow wow wow, it's so violent and awful, and yet the filming and acting, wow again, it's virtuosic and artful. On that most visceral level, there is no faulting a film with this kind of cinematic integrity.Questions start to rise by the last hour, however. In terms of the subject, you wonder, could it be so? Is life so apparently run by children with guns? Where are the older thugs, where are all the kids who aren't criminals, on and on? You come to realize this is a hugely partial view. That's okay, for sure--it's a movie--but it then draws attention to its own need for violence. You will never see so many people ruthlessly, heartlessly, even laughingly murdered, point blank, by children, on and on and on. This makes the movie awesome and awful, both. As a narrative story, it needs, it demands, greater complexity, and maybe, even if it's basically fiction, greater truth.On this level, the movie begins to depend on its energy to succeed. It has energy to spare, for sure, both in the acting, and in the camera-work, both of which are nothing short of unbelievable. But there is a lack, oddly enough with all these 'types' of young men and boys, of actual 'character.' Where is some sense of the psychology behind so many of these people. Yes, the mood, the interactions, the scenes taken whole, the groups and even the confrontations leading (usually) to murder, all are filled with human depth. But the individuals seem largely to be types of people, not digging into their motivations and their inner states of mine. Maybe that's asking too much.I've seen the movie twice now, and twice I got anxious half way through because it was mostly kinetics and film-making on crack. And it really is astonishing stuff. But as with Slumdog Millionaire, the fractured and imaginative mise-en-scenes would mean so much more with deeper understanding of the human elements involved.A masterpiece, with some large chinks in its armor.",9,5,8,14 July 2010
Behind The Candelabra," Driven actors, glittery characters, and a slice of very weird Las Vegas life
","Behind the Candelabra (2013)Well, there's the story of Liberace, which is astonishing in its own way. Then here is Michael Douglas being Liberace in a true bravado performance. So first things first—see this. It's just a hoot, and a well done biopic. Throw in Matt Damon's first rate performance, and some other secondary believable parts, and you realize there is some serious discipline involved. Most of all it is Douglas who manages to not overplay the part of a man who overplayed his public life to an outlandish extreme.If you don't know who Liberace is, you'll find out, but it helps to have a clue (and I have some memories of people liking him, and run across old records of his at junk shops all the time). He was a kind of piano force who decided not to be a serious concertizer but to simply entertain. He wanted to make people happy, and that pretty much sums up his life.Liberace also seemed to lack some kind of long term empathy that would see the damage he might cause young men who got sucked into his influence—and bedroom. It really didn't quite matter, and in his superficial way you can see why. It was a trade off of one kind of oversized entertainer for a more compassionate and giving person—or something like that. It's hard to sum up here but in fact, the big point somewhere, is people of all stripes were playing immediate pleasures against deeper commitment.There is ultimately something thin here as a movie, and it only filled in a bit by watching some Youtube filler on my own afterwards. You might do the same. Comparing fact and representation is pretty amazing.",8,6,9,19 December 2013
Gone Girl," Tightly made, slow to get going but then it gets going in classic thriller fashion
","Gone Girl (2014)First a warning—don't read any (ANY) reviews about this movie unless you want to have at least a little of the plot surprises ruined. I've tried hard to not say too much here, but it's impossible to be perfect. Read on, here and elsewhere, with caution.On the surface, 'Gone Girl' is a common thriller formula. A husband and wife are having a tense time of it, one of them seems to have committed a crime, the main character seems to be wrongly accused. And then some facts pop up in the wrong places and the story gets more creepy and complicated. This is what thrillers do—set up a murder, set up a likely perp, have the facts lead us in circles through lots of spooky territory.On those terms this is fairly straight up story-telling. Yes, there is a sort of big twist an hour into the film, though you see it coming. But there are bigger twists in better thrillers. And yes there is some chilling psychology at play, both with the leading man, Ben Affleck, who plays a very regular guy with almost too much regularness (he's sometimes a bore), and with the leading woman, Rosamund Pike, who keeps it in check beautifully.So what does actually make this movie hum along so well, once it gets going? The filmmaking. The formal, technical aspects of a movie make it good, in that slick David Fincher way (remember 'Fight Club' above all). Transpose this plot into a film noir setting with sparse, contrasty black and white and much faster editing and, well, you have a better movie, perhaps. But you have the same result—a movie that uses drama in the camera, editing, and sound to propel the twisty plot. There are some good commentaries out there about the roles the men and women get, and how they reflect on society. There is the chief detective, a smart and wily woman without the coy maternal edge of McDormand in 'Fargo.' There is the African- American lawyer who lights up every scene (this is none other than Tyler Perry, and he's great) and who is maybe the only one who gets what's going on outside of the couple themselves. And there is the wife, about whom I can say nothing.So, yeah, get past the opening half hour which is kludgey and slow. Smell the quickening plot in the second half hour, and then hold on for the real stuff, the final three half hours as the conflicts actually clash and cause smoke and fire. To call this a post-modern thriller that wears its clichés proudly on its sleeve might be an excuse for using so many clichés, but it's all well done, very well done. See it.",7,1,7,22 November 2014
Django Unchained," Amazing formally, and with a moral complexity that will work on you from within
","Django Unchained (2012)(A second take at the bottom after seeing it again six months later.)What a wild, imaginative, provocative, beautiful, disturbing, excessive, nuanced movie.Is it a masterpiece? Maybe. Or yes, absolutely, as long as you can stomach some of the bloody mayhem. In terms of the core qualities of any 'great' movie there is no argument here. The story is well told, filled with turns, believable in a fictional way, and entertaining. The acting is superb (or at times incredible). The photography and lighting and editing--the visual basics--are all excellent. The sound and soundtrack (including odd and wonderfully varied anachronistic popular songs) take you by surprise with their validity.The movie is overtly original in that Quentin Tarantino way that is firmly rooted in classic movie-making. It refers to older styles openly, including the ridiculously bold red lettering of the opening credits which are a little like the orange-red lettering of the first widescreen color movies in the mid 1950s. The music at times invokes spaghetti westerns, and the broad landscapes echo that (and in fact the cowboy theme takes us very close to these 1960s movies which Tarantino so loves).So, yes, this is a great movie in all these ways.Can you address the content more directly here? Is this movie about morality, about slavery and justice, about love and walking through fires to achieve it? Yes, of course it is all these things. But, many ask, does it tell the right story about these things? The first answer is, who cares? The director can say what he likes, right? Well, maybe maybe not. He can, of course, but he has to face the music of his critics because in fact movies are not just about cameras and storytelling conventions. They take on meaning, they move people to think, they cause palpable reactions.And so I'll come to the defense of the movie in the simplest ways. First of all, the ambiguity of the main character, the white bounty hunter played by Christoph Walz, is balanced and provocative and without real judgement. He's a cold blooded killer on the path of righteous judgement, a kind of John Brown revolutionary with a hankering for wealth, which he never gets to spend. Likewise the other lead, the black slave played by Jamie Foxx, is both victim and filled with bloody vengeance. It isn't automatically easy to justify everything, but it makes sense on some level, too.I realized when it was all done that the movie pulls off something I hadn't quite seen before--the real horrors of slavery. I think Tarantino 'gets away' with it because his style is so exaggerated and unreal. The hyper-fable approach makes it possible to be comic and horrifying. If a movie just went ahead with a straight on with torture and brutality to show how bad slavery was, almost like a documentary, it would be unbearable, almost unforgivable. But here we see the worst kind of injustices as part of an approach that at other times forces you out of total verisimilitude, and you cringe and hate it but you go with the flow. Don't mistake things. This is one bloody cruel movie. To make people blow up with more guts and blood than usual so that it's like a comic book death does not make it less bloody. Blood will soak some scenes like graffiti art. And sound effects are used with amazing clarity to emphasize aspects like people's guts flying through the air--or, in a totally opposite way, to hear the searing sound of the ash on a cigarette as someone takes a puff. It's that kind of up and down, deeply thoughtful movie.See it? Of course, if you can stand a little over-the-top violence. It's morally sound, it's exciting and funny and fun and moving. It's beautiful. It's comparable in many ways, formally and in terms of content, to 'Inglourious Basterds.' If you liked that, you'll like this. I thought it amazing through and through. Masterpiece? Why not?Second take: I had a slightly less overwhelming impression this time. It's still a masterpiece of filmmaking, for sure, but some of Tarantino's decisions--what kind of bloody excess, how much to say derogatory words, how to push and pull the plot--seemed slightly contrived. As if his style was forced on the movie, rather than used to further something within the movie. I also watched Inglourious Basterds again recently, and found I still am perfectly amazed by that movie. For now, it's the better of the two (and they have a lot in common structurally, and thematically). Anyway, the rest of what I felt goes. Especially the necessary revulsion. Necessary. A terrific movie.",9,22,47,13 January 2013
Amadeus," Big, fast, crazy, touching, and gorgeous. And with lots of Mozart. Superb stuff.
","Amadeus (1984)A million reviews have been written about this deserving movie--and the big points are good ones. And debatable. One, the play was better. Maybe. The play couldn't use cinematic tricks for its effects, but the movie really took it all much further in movie terms. It's a movie, not an adapted play.Two, it's inaccurate. Yes. Of course. It's a dramatized movie based on an historic figure. The truths are plenty--the boy genius, the patronage, the music scene in general. The fictions are worth noting, mainly that Salieri didn't kill Mozart (there is zero evidence of this, just chatter). Salieri didn't transcribe Mozart's final Requiem at his death bed. And Mozart's wife didn't sound like a ditzy American. Of course. Three, the operas are staged in contemporary terms, like dry ice effects. The venues are appropriate, and in fact, Mozart's time is not that far from ours, not in the larger picture.Speaking of venues, the whole city of Vienna looks terrific--because it's actually Prague. Go to Prague now and it'll have the same effect, though without the gray severity. Yes, Mozart was buried in a common grave. Yes he died too young from still uncertain causes (see Wikipedia for a full rundown of likely options). And yes, he was pretty innovative and radical. And if not as silly as Tom Hulce's interpretation, still a renegade socially and musically.Is it a good movie? Yes, a great movie. Who won't like it? Well, people with an aversion for historical dramas might, but even here, it zooms with such crazy, fun, funny energy, I don't know why it wouldn't just suck people in. Eventually though there are short scenes that are basically straight opera, with some continuing story along the sidelines. If you hate hate opera, you might have to just marvel at the sets and crazy crowds.There isn't a bad actor here, or a bad moment, really. And the music, the music! It's wonderful. The performances, take note, are by the high water mark of Mozart performances in the 20th Century--Sir Neville Mariner leading his famed orchestra. Likewise, the opera productions are by one of the great talents of the era, Twyla Tharp. The director Milos Forman has a short resume but it's impressive, including 'Hair' as a kind of precursor and 'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest' as proof of some kind of higher ability. (Forman hasn't always been on target, though, notably with his highly polished but pushy and almost abusive 'Goya's Ghosts,' which has a similar structure to 'Amadeus,' building a large world around a true rebel artist.)Anyway, a marvelous movie, a truly lovely experience, beautifully filmed, intensely envisioned, and acted with aplomb (F. Murray Abraham is a wonder as Salieri, young and old). And it is layered with some of the most emphatic and resolved music ever written.",10,3,4,3 March 2012
The Game," Twists upon twists, amazing filming, stunning acting, and a preposterous end
","The Game (1997)The steely intensity of Michael Douglas comes to play once again here in a role where that determination keeps getting waylaid by the mixed-up birthday present he's been handed, somewhat against his will. Or against his better judgement, at first, because he does sign off on playing 'The Game,' which is an experience with a bow. That is, without any good clues about who the players are or why it's quite happening, except that his birthday has come and gone, events begin to happen around him that are inexplicable. And that he can't ignore.Intensity rules. Douglas, playing the obscenely wealthy Nicholas Van Orton, gets led further and further into the madness and crime and murder of this huge huge charade. Or so it seems.In a manner the director, David Fincher, is cozy with, reality bends but psychology seems to be solid. That is, you are secure, somehow, in the main actor's head as the world distorts. The main example is of course 'The Fight Club,' the distortions are almost literal in the more ordinary 'Panic Room,' and the world is somewhat friendlier in 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.' Yes, these are all Fincher films (as is the brand new American version 'Dragon Tattoo' flick and the riveting 'Se7en').The production and the shooting and editing in particular are all first rate, classic Fincher. Douglas plays his part with conviction and you end up not quite sympathizing with him (he's a spoiled jerk even as his world evaporates) but you certainly are in his shoes, wondering what is going on. It's crazy and exciting and certainly baffling for a viewer--which is part of the game, actually. The viewer is another layer in the layers of perceivable reality.And then it just goes too far. In a way, the film is preposterous from the start, but yet you go along with the idea because very rich people have very unusual lives, and maybe this kind of mind-trip birthday present with lots of people participating could happen. Money moves mountains. But when things get almost comically absurd, when the twists of identity and loyalty keep happening, you want to just say, walk away. Get a grip. Refuse to play, or maybe (at least) refuse to believe things like this are possible.This is where Michael Douglas is perfect, and maybe does what few actors could pull off. Because as it gets insane, his character toughs it out. He's the type to take a challenge, to get extreme, to be risky, to protect his self-interests without surrender.In some ways it's a great movie, so watch it as if it'll never let you go. And when it's just too much, be glad you went along for as long as you did. And enjoy the rest of the show for its theatrics. It remains really well made all through.",7,9,12,8 December 2011
Unknown," Weak in the knees...some great action and suspense, but wobbly wobbly logic
","Unknown (2011)If you don't mind implausibility on a platter, and lots of formula stuff packed into a modern day Berlin thriller, you might just like this movie. It's well made, in physical terms, and the acting is good if nothing distractingly good.But boy do you have to look the other way time and again as the actors do ridiculous things. Even when the biggie (huge) twist occurs partway through, it doesn't change the unreasonable behavior of many of the leads, both on the good side and the bad. And most of it was avoidable, maybe just a matter of expedience to get to the next creepy moment, or the next fistfight (there are a couple of doozies), or the next car chase (there is an epic pair of those, too).I like Liam Neeson the way you might like a lonely neighbor for Thanksgiving. He's warm and a gentle guy, sort of big and sort of handsome and totally regular. I don't think he's an amazing actor, for sure, but he holds his own as a seeming biotech research whiz going to an international conference. At first the leading woman in his life is his wife, but that doesn't last long, and the real star as his female counterpart is pan-Euro, German born actress Diane Kruger, who is sharp and excellent. Oddly, she plays an illegal immigrant who isn't German at all, and pulls it off completely.You might compare this movie to any number of recent international intrigue movies, but this one has at its core a particular kind of brain washing, or memory lapse, that is an echo of Jason Bourne (and a bit more believable, in a way, since Neeson doesn't play a superhero in any sense). It also has a resemblance to a recent Liam Neeson movie, 'Taken,' where he again plays the disgruntled everyman on the warpath for justice against his dignity (his daughter was kidnapped in that one). I did mention, though that the movie patently absurd. I'll give one example at the start--he forgets his briefcase at the airport and realizes this at the hotel and instead of just popping his head in the door to tell his wife he's going back to get it, he just hails a cab and is gone. Then, in the cab, there is no cell service. In downtown Berlin. Okay, it's a conspiracy, and they've tampered with his phone and his wife is really a double-agent plant and so it's all logical. Except not quite. You'll see.But because it's so implausible, you do give up worrying about it being at all true and just go for the fantasy, like maybe 'Minority Report' gets away with by just setting it a bit in the future. 'Unknown,' with its wishy-washy title, is hard to hate, because it's fast and fun, but it's hard to especially like or admire, either. That much is known.",6,3,8,25 April 2011
The Longest Day," An editing masterpiece, an epic day, lots of great filming, but also diffused and imperfect
","The Longest Day (1962)This is an ambitious movie, extremely well photographed, filled with stars and secondary actors of fame and talent. And it covers roughly at 24 hour period leading up to and into the epic and dramatic June 6, 1944 invasion of German-held France known as D-Day.On all these levels, the movie almost has to succeed. And it does. It's a popularizing account of an important event. It's history made simple, for sure, but it compresses the complexity with good intentions, and with some fair handling of both the German and non-German sides of the battles, inside and war rooms and on the beach.The movie is filled, however, with so many characters (maybe fifty who are given enough camera time to take on some small meaning, though the poster advertises '42 International Stars') and shot in so many locations (Germany, France, London, on boats, on beaches, in villas, by the bridge, in the bunker, in the strategic commands, along the roads, flying overhead, on and on) it is truly impossible to engage in any one part of it fully. Many scenes are superb, even short ones, sometimes with great actors like Robert Ryan playing with a light on his face (in a comic scary way) and sometimes with unknowns who for a moment shine in their terror. But it's necessarily fragmented and dispersed.There are, furthermore, attempts at humor that are a welcome break to the seriousness but are sometimes too silly and improbable to really make sense. It's like the humor that perks up little moments in a Chris Nolan Batman movie--except this is real life, this is the real D-Day and not an entertainment. You don't expect a documentary, exactly, but the levity--even if as cute as a young Sean Connery goofing on the beach as bullets fly around--is a bit off target.The fact that this kind of movie works this well is probably amazing. It even got divided between different directors, and so the unifying qualities show a kind of logistical planning that paid off. (There are only two cinematographers and, crucially, one editor.) And of course there is history holding it together.And this is a history that is getting lost. Fans of WWII movies (or of WWII history) will have no trouble feeling the grand, world-changing nature of D-Day. I grew up on American movies and around my parents and grandparents who had strong feelings about the war and about D-Day in particular. But young people, like the students in my classes at college, often born fifty years after the fact, have sometimes not even heard of D-Day. Many don't know a Nazi from RAF officer, even in concept. (I'm not kidding. I ask, routinely.) This is just life. Blame education if you want, but it's a natural movement forward to more recent and still living world events. We had D-Day, they have 9-11.I watched the movie with my girlfriend who is not from the States, and who knew only the outline of the war. (Her country wasn't involved in it enough to make a dent on its own history.) And so she watched with a kind of dulled boredom. The cameos by famous people were fun for both of us, and filming was to be appreciated, but the drama I felt even with the opening credits I saw was dependent on knowing the larger scope. And so this movie will have a shrinking audience and shrinking appreciation over time. It's a long watch--three hours--and it has a steady stream of great moments. But it's not a great movie in movie-making terms. Exciting and important and with a wikipedia page to make this all clear, but it's unlikely to fully integrate and take total form as a whole.",7,6,7,12 November 2012
Ex Machina," Clearly delineated and riveting...ideas, personalities, and the future, now
","Ex Machina (2015)The idea here is brilliant, and the three actors that matter are spot on excellent. That includes the obviously constrained performance by the robot/human/thing, the character referred to by the title.And it's the ideas that float along that mix with the three personalities beautifully. They have purposely made the two male leads idiosyncratic. First is the youngster, Caleb, a single thirty-ish male who is a nerd and a bit naive, but also very smart and computer savvy. He is the one visiting the isolated research facility in what is supposedly a Turing test. (The facility seems to have one researcher which is just absurd, but that's to make the movie dramatic.) Caleb is played with wonderful quirky restraint by Domhnall Gleeson.Then comes Nathan, the loner eccentric genius behind the new robots with amazing artificial intelligence. His cool dude persona is probably overplayed but it makes him exceptionally normal and human. And he's filled out with unusual perception by Oscar Isaac.Maybe most notable here is the director and writer, Alex Garland. Because it is the writing the strikes you over and over as both clever and provocative. It digs into the issue of what it means to be human—or what it means to be a robot—with wonderful perception. And this is his directorial debut—his first movie! And it's not enough. Yeah, as good as this movie is, you'll likely leave feeling a little short changed. As far as it goes—and it's really a great movie and you should see it—it's no 'Citizen Kane.' And by that I mean, here's a brilliant first movie just like Welles's, and yet Garland decides to go for a linear, step by step approach. It's compelling in its own way, but it's oddly simple by the end. Maybe this is partly because I've read and thought about these ideas a lot. If you are new to A.I. you might find it more revelatory. I hope so! Certainly the Kubrick/Spielberg 'A.I.' and the recent 'Her' deserve a viewing to fill in some obvious holes. In fact, once you start looking you'll see this is a whole new genre, and an incredible one, including everything from 'Moon' to 'Frank.' Go for it.And start here, for sure. Great acting, interesting (though highly unrealistic) sets and setting, and a steady flow of ideas as it goes.",8,3,8,9 June 2015
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Impossible and yet a perfect fable for love, memory, aging, and life itself.
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)Magical, bizarre, emotional, sentimental, gorgeous, profound, impossible.Thankfully the director of this amazing short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald was David Fincher. You can imagine how overblown and needlessly saccharine it might have been in the hands of a more centrist director (say James Cameron) or how needlessly fanciful and detached by a more visionary one (say Baz Luhrmann, who just released that other Fitzgerald adaptation, 'The Great Gatsby'). Fincher shows a sense of psychology in the characters, and of probing how we all think through edgy, improbable situations (from 'Fight Club' to 'Se7en' to even the one-dimensional 'Panic Room').I say 'amazing' story because in fact the original story is even better than this really moving, excellent movie. (It left me weeping at the end.) So maybe start there. Google 'Benjamin Button xroads' for the full (short) text.Or start here. The beginning makes clear the problem. A child is born an old man. Infant-sized (unlike the story) but with cataracts and arthritis and so on. And as he grows (and does not die as expected) he gets younger. Eventually he becomes a tottering Brad Pitt, and then an extremely handsome Brad Pitt. And then...well, what can happen as you get so incredibly young after six or eight decades?I know, I know, how ridiculous. But somehow Fitzgerald makes it all work, and Fincher pulls out that core for the story here. The biggest issues are love and death (as Woody Allen keeps reminding us). In love, you can see how it might be frustrating to fall in love with someone and then realize that as they get older you get younger and you end up literally growing apart. In death, the problem is even more profound, because even though the title character, Benjamin, seems to be lucky because he doesn't grow old, by his final years he ends up facing all the same problems--losing friends, losing his ability to function as he once did, and eventually, shutting down. Dying. (The final line of the book: '...and the warm sweet aroma of the milk, faded out altogether from his mind.')This gives nothing away, not really. It's how this happens that matters. And simply seeing it happen. This is where Fincher does such a solid, delicate job. There has been a lot of worthy talk about the effects used--aging people (in both directions), and working with the different eras so fluidly. The movie does span most of the 20th Century, ending with a Hurricane Katrina echo in the 21st. It's a visual masterpiece, for sure (much like 'Hugo' is a computer-enhanced masterpiece in turn of the century France). But not once does an effect get in the way or announce itself. Pitt, it has to be said, is brilliant--and brilliantly restrained. Unlike his 'restrained' role (one might say deadened) in 'Tree of Life' we see here a subtle inner mind at work, an 'old soul' with some wry wisdom and delight at being alive showing. He's sometimes played up for his looks alone (on purpose, and it made us laugh out loud at the poster-boy look he can pull off), but mostly he's just really convincing. Equally so, but with a smaller part, is the other main character, Cate Blanchett, who also ages (in the normal direction) and works through her years against the main character's.There are some additions to the movie that are moving and not Fitzgerald's, and some of them are unnecessary for the story, and maybe distractions or attractions depending on what you need from a movie. The biggest example is the way the story is told through reading a diary at the bedside of a dying woman in a hospital as a hurricane approaches and the lights flicker. It brings to mind 'The Notebook' (which will make you cry even harder than this movie will), and it's not badly done, but is not actually helpful, either, except to give the plot and the characters more depth. Likewise, there are lots of little historic scenes thrown in for drama--World War II, for example--that are purely extra material. Good enough. But also more than enough, perhaps.Most of all the movie changes the love-affair of the story from a realistic and heartbreaking tale of aging and changing attraction to a very Hollywood 'love is forever' kind of romance. It's fine, and you'll probably like the optimism, but Fitzgerald tapped into something more trenchant that Fincher was apparently afraid of. The movie is too long for sure, dragging at times. And it's too dreamy and sentimental for its own good, too, at least sometimes. It lacks some kind of puncturing force, wrapped up so nicely as it is. But see it, regardless. It's got too much to recommend it overall.",8,2,3,7 October 2013
Lincoln," Moving and important...with a mind-blowing performance by Day-Lewis
","Lincoln (2012) A highly polished, restrained, important movie.That doesn't make this an exciting movie. The acting is terrific, and filming excellent (including a color saturation pulled back to give it an old look without seeming affected). It is clearly expert in the way we expect from Steven Spielberg above perhaps anyone, at least in the mainstream conventional sense.But there are two things that make this movie a must see. One is the content. It's about one of the two or three most important things ever to happen in this country--the fight to end slavery during the Civil War. This is such powerful stuff it will make you weep. (If it doesn't, you'll have to ask why.) It's laid out as clearly and emphatically as possible while still keeping accurate.The second thing is simply the overwhelming performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. It is so good you forget it's a performance (unlike, for example, his intensity in 'There Will Be Blood' which stood out as a work of acting above the movie). Here he is so woven into the fabric of things he is indistinguishable from the historic truth, somehow. It's really the magic of the transparency of movie-making of this kind. Amazing performance.It seems sacrilege to say this but the movie isn't perfect. Because of its material--getting the anti-slavery amendment through Congress--it involves a lot of talk, and a lot of people that you have to keep track of. I think Spielberg did this as good as it could be done, so no criticism there, but it does mean a lack of physical and even emotional drama through much of the film. I don't mean it's dull, just that it's conversational. I also found shreds of Spielberg's Frank Capra quality of making the movies--and his subjects--a little simplified. He ties up loose ends. He makes it all a fine package, very fine. Maybe too fine for what I would call high art. At times.I think we'll have an easier time judging it in six months, or six years. Also the subject matter makes it almost unassailable, since clearly most of us are all for the passing of any anti-slavery legislation.See this for all the reasons you have heard. Don't miss it. Maybe down a coffee before you go, but see it no matter what. As I say, it's important. It reminds you of greatness, and that's not something to miss.UPDATE over one year later: I see that I accepted a lot of decisions by the writer and director as their prerogative, like focussing on one issue and narrowing to a short period of time. I had no bones with the scope of the movie. But in retrospect I see how the limitations of time and scope and background also create a sense of mis-information. That is, if you want a bigger picture of Lincoln, this movie is not quite right. Its aggrandizement is also not unavoidable, like the somewhat insipid (and yet moving) recital of the Gettysburg Address at the beginning by soldiers. Overall, though, I stick to my main thought--see it, and soak up what you can, without expecting perfection. Yes, see it for what it is, nothing less.",7,62,97,3 January 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A pair of amazing performances and a circuitous whodunnit
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009)An ambitious, complex (at first), offbeat Swedish thriller. There are some really refreshing aspects, not the least is the two main characters, who are not the stereotypes that American (and British) movies seem to be trapped into. That is, these two are really interesting, and driven to succeed, and not just pretty or suave or sexualized. So we focus on the plot for its own sake, and the characters for theirs, avoiding at least some of the threadbare clichés of this kind of step by step detective/conspiracy thriller.At first the story will seem overly convoluted, but it's nice to remember those certain movies where you have to trust the story to explain itself over time, which it does. Movies that don't dumb down, which this one doesn't. There are, unfortunately, some apparently necessary familiarities with uncovering a crime, like photos that get blown up to reveal new details, and tie-ins with mythic or medieval sources (in this case, an old Bible). And the mistreatment of women. There is also a sense that the perpetrator, since he or she isn't known to the viewer, is a bit abstract, and not, until the end, a threat.This throws our attention on the quest for information, and on the two leads. The idealistic reporter, played by Michael Myquist, and the counter culture corporate spy, a young woman with piercings and a troubled past, played by Noomi Rapace, are absolutely first rate. They underplay their rather juicy parts. Admiration goes especially for Rapace, who could have hammed this up terribly, or just cheapened her role, but she does a prize-winning twist on all that, and you come to like her more and more as it goes.The last two minutes? Boy I hated that. It's as if a certain honesty and love of pure truth and justice is thrown out the window for glitz and artifice. But wow, the two and a half hours up to that point are riveting, wonderful stuff. And American viewers should know that this is just the first third of a trilogy, already filmed and released in Sweden, so there's still a wild, intelligent ride ahead.",8,5,9,14 July 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A gorgeous, claustrophobic, layered reminder of McCarthyism
","Good Night and Good Luck (2005)Filmed with a low-key and brooding intensity, with lots of curling smoke and fast, overlapping dialog, this homage to Edward Murrow is also one of the best insights into the insidious evils of McCarthyism on film. Director George Clooney, who also co-wrote and appears in a major supporting role, manages a nuanced and delicate approach where something sensational would have been tempting. The gradual building of the CBS effort to speak out against McCarthy is layered with more personal problems among the newsroom staff, some of which have to do with being hunted down by red scare henchmen. The maddening complicity of the country as a whole, which often watched passively as people were called to committee hearings or simply fired from their jobs for not signing loyalty oaths, is the real terror, and it has echoes in the current practice of employees signing loyalty oaths to the corporations that then control them unreasonably.What to look for? The seamless interweaving of archival footage of Senator McCarthy and the contemporary scenes. The startling perfection of much of the acting, especially David Strathairn playing Murrow. The photography, which moves lyrically through the glass walled studios, and shoots from behind people and through groups, and plays with light and layers of images. And most of all the subtle way the political reality is inserted into what looks at first glance to be a period drama.Fascinating production details? It was filmed on color film stock and converted to black and white, and so it has a slightly softer sharpness than true black and white film. Test audiences complained that the McCarthy actor was too exaggerated to believe--until they were told that it was all actual footage of the senator form the 1950s. Clooney was paid one dollar each for his roles as actor, writer, and director. The main events occur in 1954, a year after Arthur Miller's 'The Crucible,' which made its anti McCarthy statement on stage. But Murrow reached the masses, and took a huge risk for his own career and for CBS's reputation, and it paid off. But there were casualties, and compromises, and Clooney includes some of the messiness even as he makes a hero of Murrow. A relatively bleak film, but never slow, and not humorless, either (the characters are writers, largely, and they are witty and sardonic). And necessary, a drama for our own times.",8,2,2,1 May 2010
Guardians of the Galaxy," Well done and dazzling at every turn...and funny!
","Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)What a hoot! This is a great spoof while still being a terrific action-adventure comic book romp. It is great? Aw, shucks, it ain't—but it tries so hard and has so many laughs it's a must-see. It's crazy to bother to outline the plot (it's a formula of power and evil and some sweet innocent good guys and girls against the odds). And there are so many main and minor characters you can't make that simple, either. But it's how they interact that makes it flow. And how they push and push the conventions to make it absurd and clever and truly witty. It's funny! You'll laugh, and laugh some more.Look for lots of bright humor, good character development, and clichés upon clichés. This is what it's trying to do and it does it beautifully. Expensive and expansive to make, but handled with real professional focus. A surprise, after many more routine blockbuster computer graphics superhero nonsense. Can't wait for the sequel.",9,2,7,22 November 2014
Paranormal Activity," Some great, terrifying aspects, but it drags, and it really is low budget in spirit
","Paranormal Activity (2007)Don't you hate it when a preview turns out to have all the great moments of a movie? Well, that's sort of true here--and they are great moments. But there is a lot of waiting around, and a lot of suspending disbelief to make this simple movie fly.Yes, it's a super low budget effort, and good for them. I love the spirit of it, and the plot proceeds steadily, if with a lot of deliberation, a steady progression to more and more horror. The format, showing the main couple sleeping each night in a kind of home-brew surveillance camera is clever, and builds suspense each time. It's a smart situation, and if it had been smart all through, it would have succeeded even with its beginner's credentials.But oh well. Why, for example, do they refuse to turn on the lights in some scenes? And why do they refuse to just leave--at least to go to MacDonald's or something for a breather? The lead young woman is a student, but you wouldn't know it. I like her in general, and that helps. And he's likable in his annoying ways, too, and he does what for a living-- daytrading? Is that still a job? Enough to pay for a big house in San Diego? Well, you get the point. There are holes in this cheesy movie to make the Swiss proud.Does it work anyway? Sometimes. You won't be angry leaving the theater. But you'll be happier watching it at home--it's all about being afraid to go to your own bed, and so might as well make it too close for comfort. The obvious precedent in Blair Witch Project is tough because that earlier movie is so much better--better in concept, better acting, more range in the filming, and an amazing ending. Here...well, give it a whirl, with all these doubts in mind. It ain't half bad.",6,5,9,15 November 2009
The Adjustment Bureau," Honestly felt relationship inside pure absurd fantasy...good stuff
","The Adjustment Bureau (2011)A fun and funny and farcical romp about fate and love. The Bureau is a layer of men— quasi angels—who watch over mere humans and guide their futures. The center of attention is Congressman David Norris (Matt Damon) who encounters a blip in the system. And helping him along (or not) is a young woman he meets twice by accident, Elise (Emily Blunt).The rules are not very clear here, even though they get explained a couple of times. The Bureau men (and they are only men) seem to have unlimited powers at times (moving the floor to trip a running Norris) and other times are helplessly running to try to catch up with him. Then they reappear far ahead. There is a trick about going through doors (rather like 'Monsters Inc.') but sometimes there are no doors and the men pop up here and there.So you can't take this seriously and logically at all. Just go with the flow. Like the stricture that this huge god-plan, mapped in little notebooks, goes all to hell if two people fall in love. Or more accurately, kiss like mad. Remember that trick when the world is against you. The movie works and will make you wonder and laugh and feel good despite its internal flaws. The main reason (for me) is the truly natural on screen chemistry and rapport of the two leads. It's as if they are hitting it off as we watch, really smiling and delivering clever comebacks with great timing. It's worth watching for Damon and Blunt above all.",7,1,1,5 June 2015
World Trade Center," The events are unbeatable, but after an hour the movie falls into boring clichés
","World Trade Center (2006)You can't argue with the story line--it's based on the facts--and you can't help but shiver and even cry over some of the imagery, burning buildings and rescued policemen.So how well put together is it? As a movie, as a two hour plus story?Very well, with some slow spots, and eventually a feeling that the story lines are in place early on and don't waver or turn as the movie goes. (In fact, if you haven't seen the movie but know the history, you might guess what happens even now, before you start.) It's obviously a movie about survival, about ordinary people doing what they can to help each other, and individuals rediscovering what really matters in their lives.For me, all of these elements are a given, and were maybe unavoidable in an Oliver Stone film (he's a director who embraces Hollywood's emotional ability to sway and move a viewer with sights and sounds). What was most chilling and worthwhile were the recreations of the falling buildings, both from the inside and the outside. This also is one of Hollywood's strengths, creating illusions. And I'm going to guess they had to make it far less dramatic and horrifying than it really was. Nicolas Cage is good, and his fellow cops, including the other lead, Conner Paolo, are fine, but I'm not sure anyone really raises the movie up by their performances. The events are the point, and the retelling of what actually happened from one small, poignant point of view. It's frankly slow and repetitive by the end, but the first half hour or so has some moments that are worth seeing if you are willing to relive that day.",6,4,6,22 September 2010
Black Hawk Down," Sweeping, gutsy, eloquent, astonishing, moving...yeah
","Black Hawk Down (2001)As much as this is a nerve-wracking, non-stop, high intensity war film that leaves you exhausted, you know that this is barely a whisper of a hint of the skim of the real thing, being there, being shot at and shooting, facing death on both sides. But what this means more than anything is the movie comes as close as a normal movie can to the intensity of being there. Black Hawk Down is a director's nightmare, and Ridley Scott pulls it off, minute after minute, with lucidity. When the layering of images, the pace, and and the kinetic motion of the camera seem overwhelming, Scott (and his crew, notably Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak and Italian editor Pietro Scalia) make this completely absorbing and sensible. The cutting and the multitude of images interwoven for scene after scene would overwhelm most people, but there is becomes poetic and logical without ever becoming easy.The acting? It sometimes seems to tip toward a hyped up, grand version of archetypes that we know and sometimes expect in war movies, but each of the many main men are intensely believable and realized. The music, too, might threaten to be manipulative, but it never draws attention to itself. And so on. Meaning only that this is a Hollywood movie, for sure, but a really really good one. It plays up the cinematic drama that makes movies movies (and not documentaries) but it is so thoughtfully and artistically considered, it rises above.Is it a masterpiece? Well, it lacks what you might call utter originality or invention, or even insight. When you finish, you sigh with relief that you've survived, but there is no inner searching left to do. This is partly because this is the truth of war, based on real events. And it's intention is to submerse you in that world, and hold your head under until you are screaming for air.",9,11,16,26 July 2010
Prisoners," Routine and decently made but familiar to the point of blandness
","Prisoners (2013)A highly rated movie at the moment, but be sure to know this is very well- worked territory, and it's a well made but conventionally made movie. There are some plot surprises but they won't be new ones. There is a detective (well played by Jake Gyllenhaal) but he's a familiar type. There is the parent (four parents, but one in particular, played by Hugh Jackman) who does some terrible things trying to find his daughter—but even this is now old territory (even Mel Gibson took that on).You won't have to suffer the mistreatment of little kids here, which is something some directors would explore and abuse. This is a story about the urgent hunting of the kidnappers before time ran out. There is no real clock to heighten our anxiety, just the feeling that the longer it goes on the more likely the children aren't going to make it. Mostly we follow the detective around as he follows leads and instincts, and the one dad who has his own idea of who's to blame.There is no good rationale for the kidnappings, either. Not money, which would have been easy, but some kind of religious freak craziness is to blame. An obsession with mazes creeps in, but even this we don't quite get. No, the specifics are endlessly avoided. Instead we are dependent on personality, and to some extent that works pretty well. It doesn't make for a whole movie, however.Director Denis Villeneuve has an interesting resume, including the hard-hitting 'Incendies' which has (unlike this movie) a clear and sensational plot line. I'm not sure what made his drag this movie to an hour and a half—some economy might have been the main thing it needed, though the lack of explanation almost makes it seem a half hour has been excised already.Lots of people will not agree with me (apparently) but as a 'useful' review I'm really trying to lay out the basic qualities that you can then judge for yourself. Bottom line? It's not boring even if it seems long, and it's a kind of film I like so I enjoyed it in a mild kind of way. That's a start!",6,9,16,27 January 2014
The Insider," Based on truth, pulling no punches, brilliantly made top to bottom. Amazing.
","The Insider (1999)Wow, this is a searing, amazing tour-de-force. It comes across as fearless, and you wonder just how it got the okay to tell as much truth as it does. It slams the tobacco industry and CBS Corporation equally (though CBS News, as such, rises above). It creates a fluid, fast, intelligible, and moving story involving several key players. And it avoids sentiment, cliché, and shock, which is sort of amazing for a Hollywood film right there.Add three amazing, central performances by men who take on their roles as if they needed to for their lives. First is Al Pacino, who often plays the righteous and indignant voice of justice, and he plays it with more justice here than ever. Then there is Russell Crowe, playing the 'insider' himself, a tobacco industry chemist who spills the beans about the lies in the industry, and with real psychological subtlety. And then, in more of a surprise, Christopher Plummer plays one of Pacino's counterparts with perfect pitch.Anthony Mann deserves a huge hand for his role pulling this together. He has a deft touch. He handles big material (spectacular stuff, really) with a steady beat of conviction, as if the point is not drama, but resolution. The music is superb, making clear that this is of course still a drama, and the editing, easily overlooked, creates a relentless but not distracting pace, leaving little things hanging just enough to keep us in suspense without obscuring the narrative.I sound breathless in praise, and I suppose my one reservation is that the movie, since it is based on known facts (and uses real names throughout), lacks imagination. That's a bizarre comment, and not a complaint, exactly, but there is a sense when all is done that it was already known from the start. Getting there was amazing, but the result is a heightened version of what we know and see all the time in the news and in the corporate worlds. And sometimes elements are repeated too often (the video tape), so you can see a trimmed down version having even more impact.But let me go back to being breathless. This is an overlooked, wonderful movie. That it holds interest so well after a decade is only proof that it might continue to work as a movie, as a drama, long after the events are in textbooks, and CBS is bought up by someone else. And so the world turns. Check this out. You won't be disappointed.",9,4,7,5 March 2010
The Dark Knight," Amazing filmmaking, great story, and some surprising, uh, acting!
","The Dark Knight (2008)I saw this in preparation for the 2012 finale of the trilogy. And it's as fabulous as fans and critics say. You don't have to like Batman or comics or New York or even any of the actors to like this movie. It's written and edited with amazing nimble subtlety. Yes, a movie with this much force and bravado is highly nuanced. And that makes it a wonder to study, or to just watch and not realize it's well over two hours long. Key attributes: 1) Heath Ledger is unbelievably chilling and present in every scene. I liked Jack Nicholson's redefining Joker, years ago, but this brings it to another dark, human, disturbing level. 2) Michael Caine, as brief as his appearances are, is a wonder of philosophical gravity and wit amidst all the mayhem. 3) Morgan Freeman in a similar way is a paradigm of good judgement and gravitas while winking. 4) The editing, which is not just putting things in the right order and at the right pace. It combines and conflicts short and long scenes in a way that builds and compounds the story, building momentum, without getting confusing, and without resorting to the visceral barrage of lots of disordered cuts. 5) The photography, which is fluid, filled with darkness, virtuosic without drawing attention to itself.It's Christopher Nolan who pulls this all together of course. He deserves the praise he gets for great filmmaking. Is it an important or meaningful film? I hope not--meaning, it's an entertainment with long coattails. It does make you think and admire certain kinds of behavior. But it doesn't pretend to have pretensions. Good.See it. It's up in the top ten of IMDb's best films (as rated by readers) and if that seems like a stretch, see it first, or see it again, and understand the accolades.",8,2,4,20 July 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," What is Greatness--in movies, over time, from here?
","2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)It seems foolish to write a review of such a widely, and probingly, reviewed film--there are whole books on it, including Arthur C. Clarke's own The Lost Worlds of 2001, and the movie is detailed beautifully on Wikipedia. In short, the movie is so unafraid to touch on the biggest of issues, and to do so without conventional religion, it's totally brave and gripping. It is also technically astonishing--the upside down stewardess, the music, the future and the past so compatible. If you can slow yourself down and just get absorbed, this is a true original, and a really beautiful one.In a fun way, 2001 is a personality sorter. There are those who love to wallow in meaning of life enigmas, and others who want to enjoy life and laugh and cry. I oversimplify to make a point. For those who want to be whisked away on a mind trip without a drop of action- adventure, and end with an LSD-style interior apocalypse, this is the movie of choice. If you require an actual plot, with a conflict between actual humans (and not just a droning computer antagonist), then hesitate.So, if it's a great movie for me, is it completely overrated to someone else? And can I get that? Well, yes, I can see how it might bore someone completely. Completely. So for my kind of personality, it must connect to something else that really matters. I saw it in the theater when I was ten, in 1968, and it gloriously shook me up, maybe even changed my life. I am sure I was already a good agnostic (a ten year old agnostic being what it is) and so the ambiguity about the meaning of the universe in 2001 was awfully disturbing. It both confirmed the impossibility of knowing anything beyond our own world, and it made me love the beauty of every moment that we have, now, while it's here. Whether it helped form an impressionable boy or just paralleled his inner nature, I can't say. So I loved it, and love it. The movie is elegant, dreamy, spacey (yeah), and trippy. It can't be watched indifferently, but unlike a shocking movie, this demands not a reaction but an immersion. That's me. I like to wallow.A good friend who loves many of the movies I do hates 2001, along with Pauline Kael (who gets hung up on the evolution/reincarnation issue) and other smart, open-minded, movie-loving reviewers. Such is the status of 2001. But my friend, as deep as he is, is a social person, and he loves human interaction and plot much more than philosophical excess. Why would he like the simple nothingness of this movie, which is nearly a silent movie from start to finish? What, beyond individual taste, in some broader, universal way, makes a great movie? The absence of a few terrible reactions. The presence of astonishing ones? Is greatness in art, music, literature--any creative work simultaneously held high as a shining example and held down for critical analysis--always relative? It doesn't seem like it. Some movies really are better, otherwise, what are we to make of 100 best film lists, or film studies programs devoted to Kane and Potemikin and The Godfather? The brilliant, innovative, risk-taking minds and bodies who poured themselves into 2001 really did have some edge on the less brilliant, less innovate people involved in other films, whatever they are. I'm not talking money here, or even expected creativity--that weird quality of knowing what pretends to be creative and achieving the look, but not the essence of originality. There are qualities that can be circled in a great movie: 1) something never remotely seen before, 2) something taken to the far edge of beauty, and 3) something that has resolution, a term we use in art school for work that seems to know what it wants to do and achieves it, regardless of whether you like it or not. A movie is great for me in more personal ways, but I'm asking universally--what makes a movie simply 'great.' I suppose this is stupid, and it's definitely long-winded.And rules are bogus, but maybe these are starting points. It's certainly easy to see what is not successful in this movie, in ordinary terms--the acting is generally atrocious (except the apes, of course), though this might be on purpose. Even the casting is questionable. I've never liked Keir Dullea in his role as the protagonist. This might be Kubrick's little bit of intuitive genius here, because he's picked an actor who has less life than the computer, and he does not undermine the movie even as he is overwhelmed by it. His acting is stretched into the mechanical, underplayed zone as a counterpart to HAL's emotive cunning. As a creative director looking to push movies artistically, Kubrick goes two steps beyond his own epic and stiff Spartacus in a decade when the American movie scene was rediscovering a new humanism and realism through directors like Penn (Bonnie and Clyde, 1967) and Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch, 1968), and actor/director Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider, 1969). It stands apart from these, an evolutionary dead end on its own terms, but hugely influential in terms of vision and technique.",10,3,7,14 June 2009
The Graduate," A parable for the time, a truly funny drama, and brilliance dripping from every scene.
","The Graduate (1967)Dustin Hoffman is beyond astonishing here. I mean, everyone is great in their parts, and the older generation in the 1960s is captured too well for words, the falseness, the materialism. But young Hoffman as awkward, yearning Ben, with a foot in old and new generations (it's 1967 and he's no hippie, but he longs to break away), makes you really feel his entrapment, and his liberation by the end. And Anne Bancroft is easily his equal, as an actress, and her own entrapment as the well-to-do and unhappy Mrs. Robinson, and her ability to lever a way free, is also palpable. All of this is a marvel to watch.It's so easy to like the plot of this film, some of the other innovations get lost, like the lighting, which is daring and beautiful with its willingness to avoid mere prettiness. When the father is scolding Ben in the pool, the sunlight glares behind his head. When Ben and Mrs. Robinson are in the hotel room, whole scenes go on in darkness and we only listen. The photography overall uses this lighting and extends the takes to an almost uncanny extent, so that conversations go on very long--many minutes--with seeming directorial ease (and therefore growing tension in the frame). The writing, too, is masterful. The plot is wild enough for its time, or ours, and is handled with such matter of factness (old woman seducing a completely wile-less younger man, really now). But it's funny! Really really funny. Director Mike Nichols started as a comedian of course, partnered with Elaine Mays, and the subtle, deft handling of unlikely comebacks is both realistic and hilarious and fraught with anxiety. He's one of those directors who understands human interaction, dialog as well as silence, with vivid, subtle keenness (he made many other actor's films, the breathtaking Closer and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf for starters). Nichols uses Hoffman most of all to lead us through the topsy turvy plot.You can't forget the social commentary here, one of the best illustrations of a generation breaking free and the reasons why. It's about the generation gap, about finding what matters beyond materialism. It's about young people having enough money to not worry about survival. It's about true love without calculation, whatever the impulsiveness, and whatever the prospects of their success as a couple. And all of this is done without preachiness (notice the cross in the almost last scene) and without emotional distance. Remember, this was filmed while it was happening--the 60s are still unfinished, and their meaning undigested. There is, thankfully, no nostalgia.I've seen this film several times over the years, but it has been awhile, and I was prepared to find holes in it, or a flagging pace, or something imperfect. And I didn't. Do I like Katherine Ross in particular as the girlfriend-to-be? Not really, but she's a type that makes sense for the year. Is the music plugged in and out logically or elegantly? Well, Simon and Garfunkle's attitude and introspection makes sense, adding to the mood perfectly, and it is fit into some of the scenes like a choreographed film score (as when the car runs out of gas). Fans will note that the versions of Mrs. Robinson are very different than the album releases. But songs are repeated, sometimes a lot, and you wonder exactly why.But so what? These are the oddities that make the film more distinctive and, in a way, more memorable. Nichols, Bancroft, and Hoffman, the little known screenwriters, and veteran cameraman Robert Surtees have made a film I'm sure is truly timeless.",10,6,10,24 October 2009
Singin' in the Rain," One of the best of these romance dance and song films--AMAZING
","Singin' in the Rain (1952)You gotta love a movie like this. But--how in the world do you talk about a classic that has grown so big it defines its own genre? How can you mention, politely, that it's filled with flaws?If there are parts that are frankly corny, to the point of being 'stupid' if they appeared in some other movie, can you say so? (The first big opening night scenes where people are getting out of their cars might be one.)If some of the dance scenes seem like throw-ins, adding nothing to the plot and offering only more lighthearted tap dancing and goofing around, isn't this a distraction? (The diction coach dance is one candidate.)What if it's just full of itself? (The Cyd Charisse ballet scenes can be seen that way, for sure.) Or what if the plot is just too obviously a vehicle, and we can't get involved like we should in something more sincere, or more surprising? (The guy lands in the seat of a moving car and finds himself next to the girl, hello?)Well, the answer to all these is you need to chill and lighten up and realize that that's how these musicals go. It's like you had Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds over to your house and everyone started hamming it up and dancing and being silly. And Donald O'Connor stopped by to play piano (and dance up the walls). And you blow it up and give it dazzling color and bright lights. Then rehearse a little so the dance steps aren't just fun, but they are astonishing, and choreographed exquisitely? And what if you, say, want to have a little history of dance thrown in, why not? And of course modern ballet is the counterpart to modern Hollywood musical dance numbers, so why not try to mix them a bit (this is Gene Kelly's doing, mostly)? So if you ramp up the affair into a big budget, slickly filmed movie, but never lose sight of its origins as a kind of fun, not-so-serious romp, it's just a great time. A corny, silly, improbable, romantic, self-effacing, celebratory great time.",10,4,6,31 March 2011
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Shifting Inner Realities and True Love
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)Shifting Inner Realities and True LoveThe simple brilliance of the basic idea (erasing selective parts of the mind) and applying it in a way that feeds into pure romance (erasing only memories of a relationship with someone) makes for a movie that still could go all wrong. But it doesn't. Jim Carrey as Joel, the main thread we have through this misadventure, is at his best--comic without being plain old stupid, and feeding some mild angst. There are moments when you wonder, is this necessary, is this really that funny (like the dancing on the bed) and I think it depends on who you are. But most of the time you are waiting for the next improbable twist, which you swallow wholeheartedly because it's just so fun, and so enchanting. There is a confusing charm from start to finish, and you can't expect to get every detail or nuance, not the first time anyway. Some clues--watch the changing hair color of Joel's sometimes girlfriend Clementine (played with steady conviction by Kate Winslet), watch the weather. And be patient. Some bits get explained after the fact.The other engaging aspect to the movie is its visual trickery, tightly conceived so that when reality breaks down the movie doesn't just devolve into chaos, or into special effects. We feel as though we are shifting with the main characters from one reality to another. Brilliant, and beautiful, too.Seeing the movie a second time had a strange unpeeling effect that at first was welcome, because I understood it far better. In fact, I understood it, period, which I can't say about some other mind-shifting movies like Memento. And the problem grows that part of the movie's enjoyment is how it puzzles you. There are lots of movies that don't work as well on second viewing because they have lost their surprise, and this is a little like that, but it might take two looks to get to the saturation point. The happy ending lacks some sparkle now--it seems too packaged. A totally amazing twist, which should be doable these days, would be to make a movie that constructs itself from the DVD in slightly different ways every time you see it. Then your own reality would jostle around in spooky ways. As it is, it's still so weirdly curious and detached and romantic in steady spurts throughout, it's a special experience, one of those movies to talk about. In the end, pure Love beats it all.",9,2,4,24 June 2009
Taken," You will be taken once the movie lands in Paris, and then it's breathlessly fast and violent.
","Taken (2008)Once the real plot kicks in and Liam Neeson goes ballistic (in his very icy, obsessed way), the movie takes off, too. With good reason. He's out to get his cute, almost innocent teenage daughter out of truly horrific danger. We feel for him, and we don't mind a lot of collateral damage in his wake. A lot.Be prepared for lots of dead bodies, including men (all the deaths are men, now that I think about it) killed either gratuitously or with mindless vengeance. Neeson's character, ex-CIA man Bryan Mills, has the particular 'skills' that give bad guys 'nightmares.' And he is skilled in a way even Matt Damon would love, just short of superhuman. (Now there's a film, Neeson vs. Damon, endless chases and almost-hits, totally breathless.)I don't mean to make fun. Taken is terrific. At its best. The minute Bryan Mills lands in Paris, he is incredibly resourceful and tireless, and the writing makes every encounter a match of wits and nerve, and the editing makes every car chase truly dizzying. We really root for this guy, and cringe at the ugly, really awful underworld he finds himself deep in. And Neeson is also terrific. Besides being believable as an angry father, he's believable even as he pulls off the unbelievable feats of a super spy, showing presence and that brooding, charming depth he is known for.The core of the movie--the Paris part--is less than an hour, in all, and the other plot, if you can call it that, is pretty lame. In fact, the opening scenes almost seem thrown together, either as an afterthought (to give the movie some heart) or as an edited down remnant, because it clunks along and has a whole series of logical gaffes, which aren't worth listing. Don't let this stop you. It's as if, when the girl and her friend arrive in the Parisian flat, director Pierre Morel suddenly shows up, too. Morel, in fact, is a cinematographer at heart, and that much is evident in the visual pizazz that keeps every scene popping. This is his second feature, and first in English, and we'll probably see more of his work, hopefully with a better writer in tow.",6,8,13,7 February 2010
Alice in Wonderland," The Lewis Carroll parts are terrific and the sets and effects mind boggling
","Alice in Wonderland (2010)Tim Burton is a genius of mise-en-scene, of inventing new worlds and of remembering the joy of innocent imagination. All of that is here, in a movie he directs but based on the so well known and so amazing stories about Alice (Though the Looking Glass, and In Wonderland). The sets and colors and changing realities are amazing stuff, all on their own. If you marvel at the language, that's Lewis Carroll, and it's marvelous. And Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are both superb (Carter surpasses superb, actually) in their leading roles in Wonderland.You can't go wrong here. It has endless details that make you gasp or laugh or just stare in wonder. It looks good, it has twists of logic, and it's cleverer than clever has a right to be.There's a feeling sometimes (as with many Burton films) that the effects are the point, and the story gets slightly swamped. And the most main character of all, beyond the writer of course, is Alice herself, played by little known Australian actress Mia Wasikowska (her mother is Polish). Wasikowska is pretty, sweet, and frankly a little dull. In a way this is logical, because she's being swept along and events happen to her, not because of her. Still, she's the star, and I wanted to feel more than curious about her. There is also an action-adventure aspect to this all that seems to pander to the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (or 'Harry Potter'?) sentiment. The good vs. evil battling is at odds with the fanciful rest of it (and not part of the author'This becomes unbearable by the huge battle scenes which are generic crap, really, and then there is an amazingly odd ending, back in reality, with talk of good old Imperial Britain going at it again. I suppose it is in theory the 19th Century still, but in fact the movie is not, and nor is its audience.Luckily there is so much else going on all of this hardly matters. Just watching, and watching more, and being in a state of wonder, is quite enough. It's a tour-de-force, a work of originality like you're rarely going to see, as I suppose 'The Wizard of Oz' must have seemed when it first came out. (Along those lines, imagine if Alice in this film was as charming and sympathetic as Judy Garland.) But really, don't wait, watch this film. It's eye-opening.",Null,4,7,18 August 2011
Avatar," The visuals, morals, and pace of computer gaming--in pulsing 3-D CGI
","Avatar (2009)Technically dizzying, morally unambiguous, with dialog and a story line aimed at teens and young adults, but clearly with wider appeal. Set a hundred and some years in the future, the helicopters landing still conjure up Vietnam, and some of the big mean soldier stuff drinking coffee in the middle of battle, with the airships rolling in over the population below, is pure Apocalypse Now. It's a 'big' movie, and visually demanding. The 3-D is terrific, smoother and more restrained than other 3-D releases (Journey to the Center of the Earth), which gives it sophistication beyond just the gimmick. I watched part of if without the glasses, and it's actually still pretty jazzy, so I think it would work in 2-D very well, if that's what you have in your area (or in your budget--they charge extra for the extra dimension). The music is heart pumping stuff, formulaic for sure, but part of the adrenalin machine.Is this a 'good' movie? Not really. It's an impressive movie, obviously, but it has a hyped up computer gaming feel to it, not only visually but ethically, and in terms of depth of plot. It does have a science fiction fascination to it, with the mind and soul switching bodies in different ways, though I'm not totally sure it makes logical sense, which even sci-fi has to do. And the clichés are fun in their own ways, even if I got tired of it all the constant running and fear, the endless platitudes, the constantly pretty prettiness (it's one heck of a beautiful planet, Pandora is). Even more of a problem is the stereotyping going on, culturally, from the natives to the military, but I'll save getting angry for another day. If you notice it, it's demeaning, if you don't, watch it again.These aren't all things to hate, but the movie doesn't have a lot to love, nothing to dig into, nothing to think about, nothing to make you feel deeply. It might make you feel in a more sympathetic way--there is room for a lot of sympathy, and if your heart strings are dangling beware--but it will do so in the way the Lion King or Pocahontas did. Someone said to me, hearing my doubts, 'You expect too much.' And that makes me think, 'Really?' I'd hate to ever say that about a movie this ambitious, even from a James Cameron who already proved his crowd pleasing intentions, and savvy, with Titanic. Expectations aside, I want more, and you might, too.I added this response to the New York Times blog, after a comment by their reviewer Manohla Dargis: Well, yes, it's sort of given that we all carry our baggage with us, and apply our viewpoints with bias, one way or the other. But Dargis is too willing to just say, 'Whatever,' as if the movie didn't have some specific narrative and symbolic qualities that can be scrutinized. That is, even if viewers come away from the movie with a diversity of views (hopefully they do), it is still true that the main character is a white male (with a disability). Or that there are almost no African representations among the humans, and few women (two, mainly, and they both die). Or that there is a kind of broad stereotyping of the natives in attitude and appearance (widely open to interpretation, but not a blank slate). Or that the invading traitor ends up being, voila, the leader of this hapless tribal people with very high ideals. Etc. Etc. If it sounds like I'm suggesting a way to read the movie, it's not on purpose. That's the baggage thing, and I have mine. But it doesn't mean that we should all just turn a blind eye to the possibilities, without polarizing the argument, and without making the movie more than it is, a dizzying entertainment a step away from some Disney classics. With all their stereotyping.",6,8,17,21 December 2009
Victory," For some this will be terrific, for most it's a fun twist on familiar sports and prison escape plots
","Victory (1981)A slow beginning leads not to a typical sports movie but to a parallel of a heist film. That is, this group of prisoners has to think of an unusual way to pull off a job— their escape from a Nazi prison camp. The method? A soccer match. It's ludicrous I suppose but it's fun, and there are enough turns of plot to keep you going whether you like light-hearted WWII films or sports films.If Pele is the surprise star here, don't expect much of him on any level, as an actor or as a player. His screen time is brief and generally dull, oddly, though still fun. But Michael Caine is his usual dependable excellent self, here as a once-great soccer player now leading a team of prisoners. He is given permission to get the best players he can find in all the Nazi prisons, assembling a kind of uber-team of stragglers and has-beens.The other actor of fame, Sylvester Stallone, plays what is almost a caricature—the American who won't fit in because he is so rebellious and righteous. And right, we hope. He eventually becomes a last-minute goalkeeper, and it's kind of hilarious and impressive (he's young but already ripped). His character is obviously more familiar with American football than the other kind, but don't let that stop an ambitious young fellow.The movie is an odd mix of acting styles and it's a bumbling kind of plot at first, but it steadily builds itself into something to cheer about. The end will be a surprise, by the way, and is maybe the one shining moment where the film, as a bit of movie-making, steps out of the box. The reviews on this site are all over the map here. My impression is that soccer fans have an automatic win-win on this one, and that the game is seen as fresh and heroic in a good way. If you don't like soccer in particular, the sport is just a lively device to work the larger plot. As a prison film or escape film this is way out of its league, sure it is, but it's still solid and inventive in its own small ways. When it gets so unlikely you have to groan, don't worry, there is a sense of beating the odds to every aspect of the plot, so why not?As you can see, it's easy to enjoy this movie even if it's nothing to write home about. Fair enough.",6,3,3,1 June 2014
The Artist," Smart, funny, warm...and a pale shadow of the great silent films from the 1920s
","The Artist (2011)This is a movie Woody Allen would have liked to have made. And if he had, it wouldn't have been his best.A fantasy and a romance, a time trip (with some intentional slippage with fact), and an homage to silent movies and to early musicals, which of course were not silent.The leading man is tremendously alive and talented, though he has that French leading man quality that American audiences do not quite warm up to. The leading woman is the kind of French woman all audiences love--full of life, an over-sized smile, a big heart.I think silent movie fans will be torn. I mean, this is essentially a silent movie, but anyone familiar with silents from before 1927 will know a different kind of intensity and sophistication. Even a different and better kind of plot. To some extent, this dumbs up (no pun intended) the silent movie aura, making fun of the industry, turning meaningful plots into clichés. Even as visually beautiful as this movie is, it doesn't match the best of the old silent films for depth and surprise, at least at times.But then, 'The Artist' does pull off a relatively rare feat, making the most of what seemed like a genre long gone. It doesn't use affected tricks like add scratches to the film or extra camera shake. In fact, there are little techniques that are wholly modern, like the very slow tracking-in shot when a character is going through some important thought or transition (this has become a standard, almost inevitable technique in the last 20 years).I'm not talking plot because the plot is almost insignificant. It's fun, it's warm. And it's a rehash of a lot of man meets young pretty girl who then makes it in the world of theater, or dance, or yes, the movies. And there are so many references to that other, better, homage to silent films, 'Singin' in the Rain,' it's almost painful. Or just sheer lightweight fun.I didn't really love this movie, as you can tell, and I really love movies. It's really well made, sincerely artistic in its own 2011 way, and enjoyable. The sold out audience where I saw it last night loved it and applauded at the end. That's where most people are at, and if you go, you'll be happy. But I'll throw in that if you really do like the silent film aspects, and not just the referring to silent films as a kind of homage, you should look at some of the great ones from the 1920s. Really, truly, originally great ones.",7,2,7,25 January 2012
There's Something About Mary," One of those comedies where you groan or cringe as much as you laugh. But such laughs!!
","There's Something About Mary (1998)A goofy, mixed bag of a film, but with a few gut-ripping hilarious scenes that you can't miss. You have to like silly stuff. You have to put up with some padding here and there (I don't recommend the longer version unless you are already love the movie). And you have to turn a blind eye to political correctness (it has none, though not like Borat, which feeds off it, more just incidentally).Ben Stiller is great in his own way, lovable and dull at the same time, which is the idea. The other supporting male actors are comic regulars, and not my favorites, but they do what this kind of movie needs them to do. Even Bret Favre is as stiff on camera and as beefy as a quarterback is supposed to be.But there is, naturally, something about Cameron Diaz, that clicks with audiences--her cute, perky charm, most of all. That fact that all these guys like her for her looks is not the most enlightened approach to love, is it? But then, this isn't a high brow movie, or one with scruples in particular. It's a pretty clumsy movie, in many ways, just a series of gags that sometimes are just too funny for words. 'Sometimes' being more often than a lot of other comedies.",6,14,25,9 January 2010
Invictus," A routine look at a legendary man at a critical time--it works by appreciating Mandela
","Invictus (2009)It helps to have Nelson Mandela as your main character. The inspiration he provided his country for decades, in and out of jail, is transferred here through a single focus--the national rugby team. In the form of Morgan Freeman, Mandela is made to be as profound and humble as he truly seemed to be, at least as a public figure.So even if you have troubles with Clint Eastwood movies (they all seem pretty decent, you have to admit, whatever the repeating clichés in them), this one rises above in enough parts to warrant the good attention. Eastwood, to be sure, never appears. This is mostly Freeman's movie, though the other big name is Matt Damon, who is good enough (as usual) in a role that is minor and fairly straight forward, the captain of the team.The best of the movie is the interpersonal mixing with the political. We get a glimpse (if only that) of post-apartheid South Africa, and of how fractious the scene was. And how Mandela used the mostly white rugby team to represent a new, tolerant country with its new, tolerant black president. It's a clever, clear way to get into that world in a heartbeat.Where the movie gets most outwardly exciting it gets more ordinary--at the Rugby World Cup. Then it becomes a kind of sports movie where the underdog seems like it really might win. It helps to have the larger themes of reconciliation and Mandela's presence mean so much in it all, but eventually it's all about getting the goal. I was cheering for the S. African team but I was also losing respect for the movie's more interesting (and important) intentions. I know, that makes me seem mixed up, but you might see what I mean when you get there.Does this sentimentalize the situation? Oversimplify? Make Hollywood and far more interesting and complicated and sometimes unhappy affair? Probably a loud yes on all accounts. But in that sense, it really is a Clint Eastwood film. Well made stuff, but not half what it might have been.",7,3,5,14 November 2012
Mission: Impossible," More effect and affect than a great plot--you won't care about much but it's fun
","Mission: Impossible (1996)The is a taste thing, but I found this movie playing so hard with movie tricks and spy clichés it became weirdly slow at times and weirdly irrelevant. You might say I wasn't supposed to much care about the characters in the twisting plot, but that's like saying they didn't really 'intend' to make a great movie, so get over it.I didn't hate this by any means, I just expected more. I think I liked the third MI movie just because it took that ridiculous, high adventure stuff further. That said, there are totally fun and purposely outrageous scenes that almost make the rest of it worthwhile. Mainly, for me, the insane helicopter train chase. Ha. I laughed and had a good time with that.For those who know the MI movies this review is meant to raise the question--what is a movie like this supposed to achieve in the viewer? And how does it compare to the best of, to be obvious, the James Bond movies (I just saw 'Skyfall,' which for all its own flaws was better)? Or does it hold a candle to the really good Jason Bourne movies? (Not really, though the Bourne movies take themselves so so seriously, they occupy a different zone. James Bond always had a kind of detached humor which works well.)Brian DePalma is a director who knows most of all how to achieve effects. In this way the movie is wonderful--the angles for some simple confrontations, the changing camera angles throughout. His movies always replace substance with style, for sure, and yet the style is so overt and so attractive it almost becomes the substance. You can watch a DePalma movie just with your eyes.I'll admit once last problem I have here--I don't think much of Tom Cruise. He's a plastic caricature. He's not a bad actor, I suppose, but he lacks some kind of intensity or style or something (I'm think Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, or even Matt Damon for some kind of 'persona' at work). He's a big part of the movie.My favorite actor/actress in this whole thing is the remarkable Kristin Scott Thomas, and she's in it for just a few minutes. Jon Voigt is always welcome, and does his job. Vanessa Redgrave frankly over does her part, but that's part of the DePalma excess. Fun stuff.In the end, fine, another scene where the weary survivors of an adventure sit and soak up normal cafe life. Take it as it comes. Not half bad, not half good.",6,2,4,4 February 2013
Super 8," Mostly fun, mostly absurd, partly great theatrics, suburban dystopia redefined
","Super 8 (2011)Oh dear, I guess Stephen Spielberg knows what might make money, and he produced this movie without taking a huge risk. And writer/director J.J. Abrams buys into the extravaganza of the Spielberg kind of sci-fi story, with suburban America on the fringe of something big and otherworldly. It could have worked even with the endlessly overworked clichés, with better writing and better direction. Yes, that would be you, Mr. Abrams.It helps to know going in that this is a teen movie, and teen viewers will get a lot more out of it because the main crew of actors are all high schoolers, and convincing ones. In fact, the strength of the whole thing depends on these kids, who are a great ensemble, smart and immature in turns and in unexpected gaffes and laughs. It's almost fun enough watching them to get through the rest. But there is the rest, which is combination E.T. (quite literally, an alien wanting to go home) and the 'Andromeda Strain' (where the military rushes in to face an extraterrestrial force, revisited recently in 'The Crazies' in 2010). The highlight for me was the last part, where a nostalgically sweet small town suburbia goes into a colorful apocalypse. Never mind the improbability of the plot, the super spaceship, the monster with unreasonable (and not quite explained) powers, or even the history of such a thing going undetected until now, surviving surely on something besides nuts and berries.In a very fun twist, there is at first a movie within a movie, where our high schoolers are making their own short and entertaining movie. That's where the title comes in (the time seems to be roughly 1975, before video). The train crash at the beginning is so excessive (it goes on forever, with enough burning and screeching for several movies) you know that something is amiss. And not just in the scene (this is no ordinary train) but in the direction (there is a woeful lack of balance). Pauses happen when there isn't time, and things are frenetic when a little pacing might have added more suspense and less kinetic frenzy.This might all make it sound like a disaster of a movie rather than a disaster movie, but it's somewhere between. If you fit the demographic, it might work. If you don't mind sitting through some ludicrous moments for the much better ones, it does work (this would be me, Mr. Abrams). And if you like seriously inventive sci-fi disaster flicks, this won't quite cut it.",6,4,7,21 June 2011
The Fly," In some ways better than the original, but with emotional holes
","The Fly (1986)I just saw the original 1958 'The Fly' and as creaky as it was in some ways, it was a thrilling idea and had some great roles. Two days later I'm zooming ahead three decades, and boy, what a difference a day makes. It's better and it's worse. But rather than compare them, we turn to the 1986 version, directed by semi-auteur big budget director, David Cronenberg.The story again dominates, but it has taken amazing leaps in concept. If you like the transporter idea, that's only the beginning. The longer the movie runs, the more bizarre and campier it gets. In fact, if you can skip the first half hour (and you could, actually) you'll have more fun. In the second half of the plot, the lead boy genius scientist (now more like 30) played by Jeff Goldblum, disintegrates. This is good for a lot of reasons, one of them is to get beyond Jeff Goldblum the actor, who seems to alway show his awareness of the camera and ruin what might be better acting, and better characters. So when he is no longer quite himself, we are mesmerized by the horrors of the plot. Of course, you have to get past the grotesqueness of it all--it is really gross--but that's part of the ongoing shock.Geena Davis? Completely convincing and solid as a reporter and eventual second fiddle to Goldblum. And the third actor with any part at all, John Getz, the reporter's editor, is forgivably awful, and meant to be unsavory. The relationship (sexual and otherwise) between these three is unconvincing at best, and the notion that the reporter would even slightly trust this editor is untenable. That much we need to believe in, just as much as we can imagine the other love affair, which is both believable and loaded with implications later.But the idea, the idea! Simplified and impossible, it's still a perfect movie scenario, and it's a riot, and terrifying. When it defies logic, swallow and give it a chance. Not a quite great movie, but great fun.",7,2,4,7 July 2010
Limitless," A clever film that plays out the possibilities of its simple mind-expanding premise
","Limitless (2011)A sharp, twisting, wishful film, well done and intriguing. If you can throw this in with other mind-bending fantasy films with tinges of sci-fi reality like 'Eternal Sunshine of the Everlasting Mind' or 'Momento' you'll see both its strengths and intentions and maybe how it falls a little short of those rather startling and full-blooded films.The idea here is simple--a pill makes you use your brain to its full capacity, so you can learn and perform at astonishing levels. But this also wears you down physically and chemically, so that you not only get hooked on increasing doses but start to have side effects. But when you are on the pills, you do things that the rest of the world notices.So our leading man played by Bradley Cooper (normally a secondary actor) takes it on. What layers it up is the reasonable idea that you can't keep this kind of power to yourself, and some people will go to incredible extremes to have and control this power. If this sounds a bit like heroin--or maybe some kind of heroin/ecstasy/cocaine mixture that gives you the best of everything without killing you first--it should. The parallels to all kinds of illegal drugs are everywhere, promising one thing and leading to another.There are some very nice filming techniques going on here--some tracking shots that go on for blocks in fast motion (probably contrived with CGI), some brief distortions (when the drug kicks in), and lots of careful use of filters on the lens (the world takes on a saturated golden hue when under the influence, and is otherwise believably gray). All of this sucks you in, consciously or otherwise. And the events take you one step to the next.It's a little weird that this is all slightly un-affecting in the end, especially at the very end, when there is one last shift of trajectory that is sudden and a bit unconvincing. I didn't quite feel for the leading character so much as I was interested. One problem might actually be over-explaining the situation, and the main reason for this is voice-over narration, a lot of it. The main character keeps coming in to explain things that we kind of already knew, and certainly sensed. Or would have figured out a few minutes later, and when we get to that next scene and see what he has just explained, it's a bit dull. It's basically like repeating himself repeatedly. See? It's not necessary.But remove the narration, or just chill out a bit and go with the flow, and you have a really good movie, pure entertainment with enough angles to keep it sailing.",8,6,9,4 December 2011
The Red Violin," A wonderful ride, a bit thin by the end, but great mise-en-scene meanwhile
","The Red Violin (1998)A total romantic fiction, rather compelling in its construction over many centuries, and beautifully wrought in each era.I don't suppose the violin needs romanticizing, nor does it need a kind of obvious group hug view of its history, but that's the feel good, up and down, loving story it takes. First there is the small violin shop where it is made, and the tragedy around this particular model, the maker's last. It's supposed to come from the same era as the Strad and other timeless fiddles. It's a great place to begin a story filled with mysteries (and the mystery of a great violin, it's shape, wood, and varnish, is given high tech reinforcement in the end with an electronic awe). So the violin is born.And it moves from a Austrian orphanage (with an unbelievable prodigy) to generations of gypsies (some interesting filming with the violin suspended in space as one after another player takes it up) to a crackpot British prodigy (who acts more like a rock star and an indulgent one, if that's not redundant). Finally it winds its way (not so improbably, because life is weird) to China, which of course echoes the modern rise of the Asian virtuosi coming from that part of the world.So the tale is the history of a violin, a possessed one. The spirit of the instrument seems to inhabit the movie. This is reinforced by an Italian fortune-teller (a kindly witch) who has an early Tarot deck. The Tarot was not used for divination that early--it was introduced a card game in Northern Italy in the late 1400s--but that's okay, because it works into the plot really well. Five cards are chosen by the pregnant wife of the master violin maker. Each is turned over for another twenty minute chapter in the movie. In a key moment, the wife asks the fortune teller, what if I don't like what it says, what if it's evil? And the fortune teller says, 'I'll pretend not to notice.' Promptly the moon is the first card, the most ominous card in the deck (I've studied tarot a bit, which is why, weirdly enough, I watched the movie). But the fortune teller doesn't say that doom is facing the pregnant wife. Instead she lies, and the movie takes one turn after another.You might think this is brilliant stuff, and it has the trappings of that. It could have been, with some slight twist of intentions, artfully transcendent. But it's a hair long at times, and by the last (modern) scenes, a bit cold and unfulfilling. I don't know the solution to what might have worked, but I know it left me interested and curious by the end, not quite bowled over, which is clearly (on the sleeve) the intention.Still, an engaging, musically rich tapestry of great scenes, great music, and a brimming story. Recommended, with slight reservations.",7,8,9,9 July 2012
Inside Man," Well made absolutely, but a hair long, and a hair routine...
","Inside Man (2006)An attempt at the mainstream by Spike Lee, and a really solid bank heist movie with Clive Owen and Denzel Washington at the two poles of the story, bad guy and good guy. The meaning of the title isn't clear until the last five minutes.Heist movies are partly about the mechanics and ingenuity of the plan, and this one is good. At first it all unfolds with alarming routine, but Lee manages to change it up after awhile by have some flash-forwards that make us re-evaluate the main plot as it happens. There are a couple of sub-plots and one of them, using Jodie Foster, is important but forced on us. But the main heist isn't enough for a full blooded movie of this kind, so there is a script weakness somewhere here.Washington as the main detective (embattled, of course) is charming and effective. He can make any movie click in his scenes. And Owen is strong in his own usual way, but we get a weirdly limited view of him because he is almost always covered with hood, mask, and sunglasses. No facial intensity here.The filming is pure Lee, with lots of moving camera and a few simple special effects, elegant and oddly a hair old fashioned. In fact, as much as I admire Lee's best films, you get a sense he's riding an old wave, a little like Woody Allen (another NYC auteur director) keeps an older style going even in his most recent films. If, for a comparison, David Fincher had made 'Inside Man' I think we would see some kind of verve and intensity and originality that Lee somehow avoids. But well made this is, and don't get it wrong, if you like crime and caper movies at all, this is one to see. I wish there was a director's cut that was 20 minutes shorter, but nestle on the couch and let it flow.",7,2,3,1 March 2015
In Time," It looks good and moves along, but the dialog and the whole concept are really really weak.
","In Time (2011)The idea here is clever on paper, but it's squandered and made ridiculous. Here's a near future where everything is bought and sold in terms of the hours or minutes remaining in your life. Everyone is physically frozen at age 25, I guess at some kind of physical ideal. But most people are right at the end of their lives, literally, with just a few hours or days or sometimes seconds on their clocks, which are visible on their arms like glowing phosphorescent tattoos. Simple things like catching buses or getting paid for a day's work is sometimes down to a second or two. If your clock runs out, you're dead. You might think this is dramatic, cliffhangers after cliffhangers, but it's to contrived to work.The writing is bland to the point of awkwardness. The big moments are timed (naturally) down to the second in a brinksmanship that is more silly than dramatic. There are shades of lots of dystopian movies, from 'Minority Report' to 'Twelve Monkeys,' and with maybe some 'Back to the Future' with the retro-cool 'Men in Black' edge. There are slicked out 60s cars and warmed over noir dialog. It's not supposed to be realist, of course, but it lacks some other kind of credibility to make you think any of it is reasonable even in its fictional world.What's almost painful is the vision of this future where there are rich and poor and cops in black coats and bad guys in suits, that's fine. But the men are all hunks and the women traipse around in mini skirts and heels. All of them, all the time. Did I say dystopia? It's true that everyone is frozen at twenty-five years old, but youth is one thing and this thin, small minded cliché of a man's future world is thin at first and tiresome after the third scene.You can see the influences here--call them references, homages--with some classic borrowed themes. Most of all, the two unlikely heroes, man and woman, end up being a futuristic Bonnie and Clyde on the run. It might seem entertaining. No, it IS entertaining, only if you don't give it too much credence. The light is terrific in a lot of scenes, and the photography is very fluid. The sets and scenery themselves are fun, lots of empty concrete bridges and night stuff and neon, and those beautiful big drainage canals in L.A..It could have been terrific, but it's anything but timeless.",4,2,4,14 April 2012
The Fountain," Cloying, superficial, grandiose and weirdly empty for a movie trying to be so profound
","The Fountain (2006)A superficially ambitious, fantastical film that throws clichés like peanut butter--sticky, oily, uncooked bits of Profundity. I love deep, romantic, obsessive movies, and I couldn't stand this one. I think young people (or my younger self) might soak this up, especially people looking for meaning in their lives. For pure inventive fantasy, the Lord of the Rings movies are far better, and less pompous, and the Harry Potter movies have better plots and characters. 'Pan's Labyrinth' has more magic and imagination. In fact, any number of movies in these kinds of fantastical realms have more going on. Because half the movie occurs in a modern hospital (with all its own clichés--the heart monitor, the dying people, the rush of medical workers to save someone) and because it's about true love that cannot die, the closest parallel might be 'What Dreams May Come,' which has the life/death struggle and the investigation of what our souls are, what a spirit is, what life is. For me 'The Fountain' was overstuffed with overused ideas of what serious, epic, mysterious, meaningful things are. It is equal parts wishful thinking and self-importance, with quasi-inventive set design (modeled after other fantasy films in its endless darkness, unwashed hair, overgrown trees, misty landscapes). It is also photographed with almost painfully consistent symmetry across the wide screen aspect ratio. I think this is meant to imply something grand and important, something with Eastern religious overtones, but it also makes the scenes static, even ones where characters are going through hugely physical, violent, or emotional events.Hugh Jackman? He's not my idea of an actor with depth (watch 'Australia' for proof)--but then, this movie isn't really about depth, it's about the appearance of depth, the kind of depth a Hallmark sympathy card has. It's not like really weeping, it's about watching what weeping should look like. Rachel Weisz is only a pretty face here, which only cheapens the movie more, as there is no real reason for the Jackman character to obsess over her. Call it love, yes--it's a love story, technically--but you won't see any real love at work. There's better obsessive love with spiritual overtones in Coppola's 'Dracula' fantasia.'The Fountain' is not without interest, but it will have to be up your alley, to get into it meaningfully. Good luck.",5,5,10,2 December 2010
Zombieland," The best of it is killer, very undead, wry, and gross.
","Zombieland (2009)What a funny romp. Zombie movies are so mainstream now, this was inevitable, an end of the world zombie comedy. And it's pulled off with enough sassy, unexpected twists (and one spectacular guest star) you have to love it. I'm not sure why they had to include as much filler as they did, not just developing the romance (of course) but creating some dead time (very punny, I know). The movie could have been a flawless, fast, compact classic. If you can just bear with the doldrums, you'll see what a perfect pitch the rest of it has. Kudos to Woody Harrelson, as usual, and to his buddy, Jesse Eisenberg. Aimed at an adolescent crowd, and at those of us who haven't outgrown our adolescence, and so comically bloody, Zombieland will repulse some of you. Think of it as low farce, all makeup and clowning around. It is what it is, and as such is what it is very convincingly.",7,1,2,4 July 2010
Die Hard," A genre-defining movie with a hero to beat all heros...
","Die Hard (1988)A fast, well paced, formula movie partly because it helped define the formula. The bad guys are really bad, the good guy (one of them, Bruce Willis) is really good. We love to hate the criminals even though we have to respect their corps-d'esprit and their professionalism. And we sure love to love the hero, who defines the American hero so well even the villain recognizes it.Is it believable? What a silly question. Why would we want that? This is an action fantasy where all is well in the end, not counting a good number of corpses. But these are mostly comic book corpses, in the sense that it's all just a game of types and of characters. Only Willis, playing a New York cop, has a fully fleshed out character (the chief villain has a large but still mostly two dimensional role).The acting? First rate. The action? First rate. The set alone, this big new style skyscraper not quite finished, was a simple stroke of brilliance. Lots of glass to shatter, lots of explosives to detonate. A few sentimental moments as we go seem cheesy but are sort of necessary to make the movie the type of fantasy it is. When there's a little surprise at the end, and even the L.A cop is able to draw his gun, we almost are relieved the movie left no possibility behind. Likewise, when Bruce leaps down the shaft and grabs onto a bit of slippery metal with his fingertips and pulls himself into a little slot, we think, no way, and of course, go for it.So, it's not a masterpiece in some larger sense of significance. But it's about as good as an entertaining Hollywood movie gets in the mold. Even twenty years later.",8,2,4,20 September 2010
Rosemary's Baby," Sensational, yes, but sensationally well made...
","Rosemary's Baby (1968)Along with the Exorcist (1973), Rosemary's Baby helped shatter taboos in mainstream Hollywood. It builds around Rosemary's pregnancy in a New York City apartment building with nice but nosey neighbors, and Mia Farrow plays the growing paranoia and genuine fear perfectly. This is a psychological thriller told and filmed with naturalism (along with a few surreal dream and nightmare scenes), and editing with smart efficiency so there is no let up in our descent into horror. Director Roman Polanski also wrote the screenplay, and it's a classic construction.Face it, the story, and the willingness of the movie makers to tell it like it is, is a mind blower. Yes, we've heard or imagined such things in jokes or in our own nightmares (heaven forbid). But never spelled out step by step and made reasonable, or likely. The cast around Farrow is really impeccable. Her husband (John Cassavetes, who knows something about how to make a movie himself) and the two neighbors (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) are absolutely convincing in their innocent, lovable guises. Even when you start to be suspicious something is wrong, you don't realize just how wrong it can be.Thankfully this isn't a Gothic horror film, laying into the macabre and occult aspects (it brushes against them just enough). Because it's really a psychological thriller. You might even expect Hitchcock to have liked the idea, but I suspect he would have shied away from the subject matter, at least the way Polanski had the fears develop into a real horror. It's only at the end that we see a different side to the story, going beyond our worries about Rosemary and her baby. And this is the sensational part of the movie that made everyone talk about it. And for me, it wasn't necessary. It wan't unnecessary, but it ends up tilting the whole flavor of the movie a bit into something campy and even silly, though everyone plays it with perfect realism.But I think most people will just gasp and be impressed by the whole thing, including the end. It's not a fun film but it's fun to watch, a treat to really study how all the elements, including camera-work (walking down halls, peering through peepholes) add up to a peculiar, masterful, memorable gem.",10,2,4,10 June 2010
Zero Dark Thirty," A straight forward depiction of sordid exciting facts, very very well made
","Zero Dark Thirty (2012)An amazing movie for what it says and for what it doesn't. And a brilliantly well constructed movie--the camera-work, editing, and writing are all in synch here. The acting is excellent in a purposeful way, too--some of the best performances come not from the leads, who are restrained professionals looking at computer screens and going to meetings, but from the people in the action. This includes soldiers and spies, but also victims and those who underwent torture.Torture, depicted one way or another, is a key element and famously controversial part of what happened, and it's shown here with quite a bit of brutality, untempered. You might guess it was even worse than this, or that it was unfairly brutal in the film--we're sure never going to know which. But it's an unfriendly part of the movie and I had a hard time watching it. (I would have edited to a shorter awful sample and then shift to allusions to torture in order to avoid torturing the audience.)But there are other elements that you come to admire and wonder about accuracy in the best way because it seems so true. Like just how did the events in the final capture and kill take place? And what kind of process did the CIA have then (and still have now) with operatives and clashes with white collar diplomats? The CIA operative here, centering around the unusually perceptive and tireless Jessica Chastain, is convincing. In fact, the whole movie is convincing, which is why questions of truthfulness matter.And which brings up the other point about all movies based on fact like this--there was no real surprise in the big sense. We know the end. We know the climax. This is almost an illustration of recent history, a 'dramatization' to use a belittling term. And so it depends a whole lot on doing a bang up perfect job. Which it nearly does. It's a powerful and interesting movie, as well an exciting action drama. And there are implications that lurk after it's done that need some sorting out. For those who care.See it, for sure. It's an interesting pairing with 'Argo' even though decades apart in setting. I found Katheryn Bigelow's previous film, 'The Hurt Locker,' to be more interesting and surprising in many ways, a better film I suppose. But this is equal to it in some ways, and so if you liked that one you ought to be in good shape here.",7,3,8,13 April 2013
Crazy Heart," Bridges is exactly what everyone says, and he lifts high an ordinary movie
","Crazy Heart (2009)The story of a country singer down on his luck is about as old and legendary as them thar hills out yonder and yet, once again, it works. Jeff Bridges is a perfect fit here, acting with such sincerity you forget he isn't who he pretends to be, the old school singer Bad Blake. He drinks too much, he has women like other men have donuts, he loses track of his life, and his family, and someone else's kid, and generally of decency until he is forced to confront himself. In the background is the charming, cute, suave Colin Farrell as the new breed of country star, clearly a corporate product, but loved by the crowds.What the story lacks in originality (and it lacks this almost completely) it makes up for in archetypal American loner survivalism on the road and on the mend. It's an enjoyable ballad of a movie, mostly for Bridges. Even when it gets slow, which it does too often, it's a pleasure to be in the company of Bad Blake. The music: it's just the icing. Bridges (and Farrell, in his briefer role) performed their own songs, and the soundtrack is a great introduction to a certain kind of Country Western.",7,2,3,16 August 2010
Mudbound," First rate ideas, great filming, and some missed chances for a great movie
","Mudbound (2017) A beautifully filmed movie, and with an important if simple message of being good-and about not being racist. Set in the deep South, the movie has an entrenched racism that some would call a normal segregated world around the time of WWII. As the inequality (and brutality) of the times is driven home, suddenly the war comes along, and a white man and a black man are each sent to fight in different units.
 The rest of life continues (and it's all rather vivid and realistic). But when the two men come home and they realize the have in common the experience of the war, and that this trumps any racial hatred they had been brainwashed with, the story makes some dramatic and moving turns.
 The cinematography is by Academy Award nominee Rachel Morrison (the first woman ever nominated), and I actually think she should have won. (The winner in 2017 was the man who shot the new 'Blade Runner' and for me the visuals were more to do with set design and special effects than actual photography. But that's me.) The style was a modified cinema verité, with some handheld camerawork and generally in the middle of things kind of shooting that really works. 
 The acting is great throughout, including by the women who are main characters without being designated that way (the men are officially running the story). What sometimes holds the movie back is the simple and even predictable manner that the story is told. There is room here for more than the obvious and the dramatic (which you will see a lot of)-the nuances of character, and of motivation and meaning, are not exploited a bit. And that's what would have made it a great movie instead of merely a very good and well-intentioned movie.
 Director Dee Rees deserves due credit for pulling this off in a way that is important and sincere. I'm not sure how big her role was in the screenplay, but maybe someone needs to figure out how movies can really soar above the big themes that are shouting for attention and find the little nuances that make us really laugh and weep.",Null,1,4,28 March 2018
Love Actually," Brilliant, non-stop, dazzling network of relationships, very British, very fun
","Love Actually (2003)This huge network of feel good stories could have been sloppy and sappy. Oh, heck, it is sloppy and sappy, and that's why it's so lovable. And great, in its own way. A whole slew of top notch actors give really sincerely spot on performances--all of them rather brief in terms of screen time because there are so many stories here, but still satisfying.What is there not to like about a movie where almost everyone succeeds in overcoming something, mostly loneliness? The point of love actually is actually just love, and falling in love, and making what love they already have meaningful. There are relationships that makes sense, like Laura Linney's heartbreaking nurturing of her mentally challenged brother to the detriment of her own love life. There is the painfully realistic and mature marriage between two sophisticated educated professionals, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, with their varying levels of sincerity. And there is the Prime Minister of Britain himself, played by Hugh Grant, who falls in love, and resists falling in love, with his secretary. Throw in a more drab if pretty-ish Keira Knightley, a wonderfully love-sick Andrew Lincoln, and the oddly adult relationship between Liam Neeson and his cute cute stepson and it gets more and more layered up and fun.While certainly the film is well known here in the U.S., it is practically a national treasure, from what I gather, amongst rank and file Brits. This is a thoroughly British movie, to be sure, and more lovable for it. For one thing, they have removed all the pomp and security machinations around the Prime Minister, so he seems just like a regular lonely guy who goes to work and gets coffee. Then there is the key scene where this Hugh Grant P.M. stands up to the visiting American President, and it's a great rah-rah moment.While not all the actors are British, most are, and some very much so, such as Bill Nighy who plays so dazzlingly well the aging rock star on the comeback. The terrific British comedian Rowan Atkinson has a couple of key roles that are brilliant. And so on. Of course the President is Billy Bob Thornton (Arkansas) and Linney is a good old New Yorker (bless her) and there is Claudia Schiffer who is international somehow, but born in Germany.All of these people are interconnected in ways that really don't strain the plot. (A wonderfully excessive chart of all these, with French text, oddly, is clickable on the Love Actually wikipedia page.) The writing and directing are both the work of one man, Richard Curtis, who has directed only one other film but has written a slew of them (and who is only British by means of the Empire--he's from New Zealand). But if the direction is solid, the writing is sublime. Yes, it doesn't strive for Shakespeare level profundity, and it doesn't reach it, either, but it's really smart, snappy, believable, funny stuff. That will also get you in the gut if you let it.",9,7,11,27 December 2011
12 Years a Slave," A direct telling of the horrors, but not quite the complexities, of a man kidnapped into slavery
","12 Years a Slave (2013)Who can possibly argue against the power of this kind of movie, and the injustice that it waves as a welcome reminder? Superbly directed and acted (especially leading man Chiwetel Ejofor playing Solomon Northup), and set with high levels of realism in pre-Civil War America, there is little to separate what the filmmakers intended and what they achieved. A work of excellence.It is not, however, quite the masterpiece it might have been. I don't mean the story or the level of competence here at all. I mean the way the story is told, the choice to simply tell it like it was.That means that the presentation is quite linear (excepting a few gratuitous flashbacks that seem like a last minute editing decision). And uncomplicated. This is the biggest surprise. I mean, the basics might seem enough—a free black man in Saratoga goes to Washington and is kidnapped and made a slave, and he remains a slave until his recovery 12 years later. But that is actually the entire movie.Oh, I know, the details are missing in that sentence. But it is these details where the movie succeeds too well. We are shown the horrors of slavery and made to experience them. It isn't that this is ignoble or unimportant. On the contrary, this is an 'important' film and should be seen. But in some weirdly surreal way, we already know everything that happens in these details. Do we need to see a woman, naked and tied to a post, whipped and whipped and whipped, with screaming in our ears? Many will say yes. We need to feel that horror even a little bit (through a movie) to understand how utterly unbelievably horrible slavery was. I would just argue back that I don't really want to be tortured directly to confirm what I already fully agree with. It's just a choice you want to make as a moviegoer. It's similar to watching a kidnapping movie—do you want to experience the inner and outer torments of the kidnapped, or see some larger view of a kidnapping situation and the complexities of that kind of plot?For me, then the movie was excellent at being literal, but that's not enough. For example, there is absolutely no hint at what the family did when Solomon didn't return home after his trip to Washington. Did they search? Worry? How? Who helped, who ignored them? Etc. That's just one of many complexities the movie avoids for the sake of a direct experience of the protagonist. I hope that gives a sense of where this unpleasant, terrific movie leaves you, and whether to watch it.",8,34,58,2 March 2014
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A battle of minds and codes of honor, as well as an adventure flick
","Bridge over the River Kwai (1957)A superbly well crafted World War II movie about British POWs working on a bridge in the Thai jungle for their Japanese captors.That may sound like a summary, but along those lines it's simply a really well made (and fictional) movie. What makes it rise above (much as 'Lawrence of Arabia' by the same director does) is the psychology, and the aggrandizing pro-British agenda. It's all feel-good stuff (if you're not Japanese, at least). And smart, sharply filmed, and increasingly complicated.There are some welcome contrasts quite intentionally worked out at the start, including a common one in these film—the different military culture of the British (in Asia still very much of the British Empire mindset) and the Americans (represented by William Holden). The Japanese are really only present in the form of the prison commander, who is a combination of cruel and pathetic. You eventually feel sympathy for the fellow in a way, as the Brits show an unlikely but well-hones superiority in engineering and in morality.There is some true basis to the movie but there were so many liberties taken with the truth that there is no need to dig into that (except for some sense of what the war was really like in SE Asia before 1945). So you really can't watch it for a glimpse of prison life in a Japanese camp. Instead think of it as a larger tale of dignity and perseverance. Alec Guinness (as the leading British officer) is wonderful.The eventual climax is filled with irony and difficulty (and tragedy), but I can't go into that and the meanings here. Let it be said that you need to stick it out if the three hours starts to seem long. It has both a resolution to the plot and to the ethical issues that turn up.Powerful stuff. In the big picture this will seem 'by the book,' an epic that is excellent but takes few chances. But it's so well made you need to appreciate it for what it is.",8,2,3,29 August 2016
A Hard Day's Night," Platinum Music on the Silver Screen--and so joyous!!
","A Hard Day's Night (1964)I've loved the Beatles for as long as I can remember, and I love this movie because of that. I also really groove to the black and white photography, and Richard Lester's jittery, cutting edge camera style (influenced I suppose by the realistic films of Tony Richardson). The mix of mad cap energy and straight ahead songs is fun, and it goes places Elvis movies never did just for creativity and fun. The Beatles are way more edgy but they come off as not a bit jaded or spoiled, none of the bad-boy rocker stuff that gets old fast. In fact, A Hard Day's Night reminds you just how fresh and light the Beatles were in those first couple of years.There, that is said. Now for the truth about the movie as a narrative film, which I think it has some vague idea it wants to be (music aside). It bumbles around and plays with old (even then) tricks of picking on the old fashioned Britons in a comic way. I sometimes found myself trying to let one scene lead to the next, and really that's not the idea. The happy zany inter- scenes between songs are just inventive, fun, craziness. That probably enough, but if you've seen the movie a couple times already like I have, or if you don't automatically like the Beatles enough just to watch them for who they are, you will probably find your mind drifting. Not that it's not exciting. It's just aimless excitement.There, now that is said, too. So back to the start. What a fun, uplifting, non-conformist, sharp movie. Nice to see a genuine sense of humor are work, and a bunch of not-so-clean lads letting 'er rip.",8,4,5,30 September 2009
Downfall," Persuasive, visceral, shocking, and enlightening. And brilliantly made.
","The Downfall (2004)There is no way to find any movie-making fault here. The filming, the acting, the sets (if you can call such amazing scenes merely 'sets'), and editing, and drama, the effects, etc etc are all as good as it gets. There no reason to even list all the great actors, from Bruno Ganz playing Hitler on down. It's so disturbing, convincing, and perfect (as much as movies can be) it'll shake you up, deeply, and properly.Historically I can only assume it is accurate. It fits all the bits and pieces I've read about the last days of the Third Reich well, and it is a fully German effort, which gives it some kind of credence. Note, for a moment, that there are a lot of these redemptive, unapologetic, probing films by contemporary Germans, such as Sophie Scholl, and there are not similar movies made by the Japanese for their role in World War II. The implications of that I'm not sure, but it's worth pointing out at least to give huge thanks to the Germans involved for wanting to be honest, openly.There will be a million ways of treating Hitler the person, including not treating him as a person at all. I think director Oliver Hirschbiegel (and his producers) make an astonishingly good effort to get it 'accurate.' It's not a documentary, and there are short scenes clearly meant to be moving beyond just information (like when Dr. Speer finds the patients in the basement of the hospital, or when the woman and the boy ride their bicycle down a woodsy road through golden sunlight). But why not? I don't think beauty is at fault here. The main narrative personality through the movie (the secretary) has at her core a sense of noticing what is true, and wanting what is right, and in the end she finds beauty by simply surviving.But there is a way to analyze what happens here, but not quickly. There are moments that are gory, but there is no dwelling on violence (many suicides take place and we don't usually witness them directly). That alone makes the movie quite the opposite of Tarantino's version of Hitler's demise, for example, or even how Spielberg might show the blood, judging from Private Ryan. The Downfall makes the facts of Hitler's madness no caricature, but a real, frightening insanity, subtle enough to inspire followers. The willingness and the sometimes stupid sheeplike attitudes of the many officers around him is a huge part of the message here, assuming we can call the basic intention of the movie a drive for reassessing the facts of the times, and the implications about how power can be so wrong, and so persuasive.Bottom line? An amazing movie.",10,6,9,28 February 2010
Whiplash," Powerful--and thin, and the 'jazz' is handcuffed 'band' music
","Whiplash (2014)Wow, the best of this is intense and disturbing and invigorating. It's about never never never cutting corners. It's about pushing and being your best until you break, and then keeping going. Who can't get revved up about that?The scene is a mythical music school, something like Julliard and Berkeley combined— intense and serious, with an element of jazz built in. And the competition, expected as it is, pushed students beyond their comfort zone to absurd and inspiring degrees. The scenes where the music leader (teacher and bandleader played by J.K. Simmons) goes apeshit over the bumbling of his students are quite shocking. I'm an art teacher, and I tried it out one day, even warning the student I was going to do it and showing the preview to the movie first, and it went very badly.The student in the movie who anchors the plot is the unknown Miles Teller, who is just fine in the role. He pushes and struggles and suffers—and eventually comes through, though with some serious convolutions.So, on the surface, this will thrill and wow most viewers. And I liked all of this a lot. But the plot is mostly just what I've described. There are two additions to it, one dismissible (the love life of the student) an the other the one socially probing aspect, which you'll have to wait to see. Excellent and needed.But not enough. If you love jazz, or have played jazz (I've done both in my limited way), you might balk at the music here. Yes. Surprise! Because this is all written out band music with jazz inflections. Until the last scene, which is critical, there is no improvisational jazz at all—none! In fact, the music struck me so cold I almost stopped watching. I hope you won't have the same problem, but it's there.I also found the overall plot so narrow I couldn't quite get past its linearity. Even the psychology of the two leads is mostly left to rants and bleeding fingers and disgust. It's oddly superficial, even if it strikes you at first as completely about psychological depth.Still, it's remarkable in its own way, and I totally recommend seeing it. The shocks will be wonderfully shocking, and the idea of doing your best, which is something most of us shamefully avoid, is a great reminder.",7,2,4,19 June 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Great movie-making, DiCaprio astonishes...but it's a bit all the same, all the time
","The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)First of all—yes, this is a zany, hepped up ride, and it's intense and tiring and impressive. ButAs crazy as the hedonism here is, this is a notably straightforward telling of the tale of a stockbroker's rise and fall. And as energized as it is, it's also monotonous. You can't quite say it's boring—or maybe you can, because after the fifth or fifteenth party overflowing with drugs and prostitutes you go from numb to restless —but it occurs to you later: the story is thin, as a narrative structure.Too bad. This could have been edited to a 90 minute movie—it's TWICE that as it stands—and it would have had even more velocity and energy. And maybe a few details would be left out, but you know what? They wouldn't matter! In fact, all that matters is the single large arc as Belfort builds a stock trading company out of nothing—out of a garage, literally—and then sees the FBI roll in toward the end.Don't get me wrong—Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing, covering the whole terrain from drugged out of his mind to inspirational speaker, from down in the dumps to innocently hopeful. He's so 'on' in every scene it's a marvel. And around him are some equally strong players, such as Jonah Hill as his second in command. The women have less to do (more on that in a sec) but the woman playing Belfort's wife, Margot Robbie, gives the character more depth than you might expect, and with a great New Yorker working class accent.Scorsese directs this as he always directs—with absolute force. He doesn't know the word subtle, which is fine (which is great overall—we have other, subtle directors). Whether you look at 'Shutter Island' or 'Hugo' or this movie (all recent examples), you see someone who is worth following closely. He's one of the great directors we have. If all of these movies have flaws, they have so many other things going for them you end up impressed, and maybe even moved.But moved—emotionally moved—is not the result of this film. You can say that was on purpose (people have). Fine. But that means the bacchanalia is what it is. You watch and watch. And it's such a man's world—and I mean men with their testosterone unchecked, supplemented, worshipped—that women are almost totally there as toys and companions. For sex and for sex. It doesn't matter if you agree or not, if you're a woman or not, or if you have politics on this one way or the other. It remains clear that we see nothing from their point of view, and we are made to accept (as a viewer in a chair) this unevenness. It's actually sickening, if you give it the time of day. And if you really study it, you see that 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is yet another film that trumpets a male over female system as good, or as inevitable.Maybe it is! (I'm not defending sexism here, hold on.) But maybe you need the testosterone to be as greedy, cruel, mindless, and driven as all the men in this movie are (including the FBI guy in his 'dignified' way). Maybe this is another way to condemn the mosh pit of Wall Street completely. Maybe there's another way to run an economy, to have corporations make things in a competitive world.Probably not, but you do strain a bit to give the movie some rationale. The real content here is more gut level—intensity and insanity. It's amazing. But it is what it is, too, an expert docudrama with surprisingly few surprises.",7,8,14,16 January 2014
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Glorious film-making but awkward storytelling, a wobbly epic
","Dracula (1992)Well, I know this is the holy grail of Dracula movies for some people, and it really is luminous, dazzling, epic, and original. Coppola is a fabulous director at his best, but his movies have been up and down (very very up and somewhat down, of course), and this is big big budget effort, and it might actually strain from its own weight. It really is an attempt to give the legend a seriously timeless treatment, taking on a complicated layering of story lines and some unbelievable set design.But it's also a pastiche, a collage of references and clichÃ©s, and downright filmic excess. To that extent it's a kind of comic book version, trading realism for heightened and simplified effects. It's bloated and in fact probably needed to be longer to make sense of some of the narrative confusions and abrupt edits. There are moments, to be sure, of amazing period sets and costumes. And moments of sheer beauty, with of a kind of time-travel wonder that makes it worth watching. Gold Oldman for me may be a good actor (in the way Keanu Reeves is not) but he lacks some kind of cutting charisma necessary for a real Dracula. Other stars illuminate their scenes well--Anthony Hopkins (with a stilted accent) and Winona Ryder (impeccable)--and the supporting cast is perfect for the flavor of the film. Even Tom Waits, whose role is more Monty Python absurdism than anything, fits in to the glitziness (and bloodiness) overall.So, what to say? This will wow a lot of people, and rightfully. It's romantic in a galactic way. It has fast camera and glorious front to back focus and lighting effects to make the most ordinary scenes come alive. And there are not ordinary scenes. This is, by any account, an extraordinary movie, to be enjoyed for the sheer gluttonous tactile feel.",7,2,4,9 June 2010
American Gangster," Gangster themes revisited with style and violence--a strong if familiar vein
","American Gangster (2007)Almost by design, this movie starts off filled with mobster clichés. The idea is to set up a world that we are well acquainted with from earlier classics like 'The Godfather,' and we see power, ruthlessness, loyalty, money, and ambition quickly mixed together. The clichés are almost boring (not that Denzel Washington is ever boring)—the gangster is charming and clever, the cop is dedicated to his job and his wife is leaving him, and all the minions and hangers-on are as they should be, colorful and secondary.So it almost ends up being just another gangster movie, this one being about a black godfather. But 'American Gangster' then adds some new elements, including some brief scenes set in Thailand and a long coda at the end where the cops and the criminal cooperate. I won't give too much away there.All of it is filmed well, edited with clarity, and acted in a straight up realistic manner. For director Ridley Scott these are almost backhanded compliments. You might expect more. In fact, as much as the grows on you as it goes, and gets more colorful and complex, it remains really conventional as a movie. It's smart enough and slick enough to work, but it doesn't rise above—and it had the ingredients to rise very much above. In addition to Washington there is a really stunning (if clichéd) cop performance by Russell Crowe. And mixed into the large supporting cast are some stunning talents. Washington's mother is played with intensity by Ruby Dee (who I know best in Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing') and Armand Assante is a convincing old mob type in the Brando vein.Mostly it's Washington's movie. He's the title character, and he plays it mostly cool and charming, flashing his smile and running his efficient and risky business with confidence. There are lessons in the story about going it alone (no middlemen, for example), about family in crime (Italian style and African-American style), and about the limits of family loyalty (drugs and money are powerful temptations). There are also hints of the mayhem of the times—the late 60s and early 70s. Vietnam forms a vague but constant backdrop (not civil rights protests, oddly). And drug use is of course an important theme in the movie, though without particular judgement. People who have died using it are shown to be reckless types to start with (I'm abbreviating). One could easily say that the dire, evil, selfish, murderous aspects of being a drug king are glosses over—hinted at for sure but shown with those some old clichés the movie uses throughout, which has the feeling of acceptance.A really good movie. It's not one bit original, but in a way that's the point. This is the story of an extraordinary rise by one black man in the heat of the late 1960s to a position of unrivaled power and wealth. It's told with precision and familiarity and a certain amount of artful competence that makes it really feel solid and significant.",7,3,5,4 November 2013
Dark Shadows," Fans of the TV show beware. Burton fans beware. Depp fans, he's not bad!
","Dark Shadows (2012) A part spoof, part earnest (oddly) vampire movie with only a few of the twists and visual effects you'd expect from director Tim Burton. The year? 1971. The source? American television.Mostly there's Johnny Depp, who again lifts his movie into something watchable. Depp's deadpan humor, with an old school British accent, is killer. He's a vampire, for sure (you can't see him in reflections, and he's not so good with sunlight) but he's got justice on his side, and a sense of family loyalty that goes beyond the Corleone flavor. He broods. He means well.When Depp's character, Barnabas Collins, gets a second chance to win back his honor and his love, it's in coastal Maine, where his nemesis, a centuries old witch, runs the competing fishing cannery. Yes, there's some silliness here, but in movie form it's too grandiose. This is totally t.v. material and here it doesn't get funny or campy or weird enough to work.There are some short scenes that are hilarious, like the lines about 'Love Story' (which young viewers won't get) or when Collins tries to learn about contemporary life from some pretty convincing second-rate hippies. Sometimes it's a bit of special effects overkill with creatures coming to life from the woodwork of the old house, or with Helena Bonham Carter at something less than her best as a cookey psychoanalyst. (To be sure, when Carter is not her best, she's still pretty good.) Michelle Pfeiffer is a wonderful matriarch, and the evil witch is played with good bad energy by Eva Green.The big problem? This is a Tim Burton movie that lacks the originality of something like 'Edward Scissorhands.' I mean, what was he thinking? Still, for pure mindless fun, especially if you don't know the t.v. show, it might be worth a drive-in kind of night out.",6,6,12,16 May 2012
Inception," It's overblown, for sure, but the effects and the concept--and DiCaprio--are flawless!!
","Inception (2010) It's hard to fault a movie that intends to redefine reality and do so with lyrically beautiful effects, and in an action adventure, high stakes genre when it pulls it off so well. It's a total trip watching, simply watching, all the realities shift, either before your eyes or from one scene to another. It's also a great mind game to follow the increasing complexity of the dreams and the dreams within dreams.Daunting to imagine filming it, and impressive to see it filmed without undo confusion. Yes, oddly enough, it makes sense! Within its own set of rules. Hats off to Christopher Nolan.Of all the actors, it's Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb who holds it all together, and who delivers some great lines well and some improbable and corny lines equally well. Without him the movie might tip into a self-congratulatory excess of superb technical achievement, and great directorial stage managing. Ellen Page, a favorite of mine, is just a hair miscast, and if she's lovable, she's not strong enough or forward enough to carry her part. The other men are up to their secondary tasks really well, each fitting some kind of stereotype just so, not to excess, with the exception (I think) of the master of magic potions. You'll see. It's all in good fun, though, so you go for the ride. Even the mysterious wife is complex in her various appearances, appearing only as a projection, though you'd never know it. Or is she real? Haha...the enjoyment of a slippery truth.The grandness of the themes, and the grandness of the film-making in 'Inception' are going to appear grandiose to some. There's no denying the effects are sensational and seamless, but the effects do overwhelm the humanity involved. Don't forget, Nolan's 'Momento' made you really enter one man's dilemma, his derangement as well as his struggle for clarity and logic. Yes, we care here for Cobb's own well being, but it gets swamped (gladly, some will say) by the effects, and by the larger logic of the movie. I'm not sure how many people were really moved by Cobb's getting home to his children by the end, even with the ever supportive Michael Caine to warm up the scene. Surely this is a sign of some kind of forced human plot that was needed, absolutely, but need to have more feeling.It's also easy to argue one way or the other that the movie is just too long. The snow scene shootouts were repetitive and not especially original or exciting, for just as starting example. 'Inception' is a calculated, cold, masterpiece of a construction, lastest in a growing line of this kind of mind bending 'what is reality' movie from 'The Matrix' and 'Solaris' to 'Synecdoche, New York' and 'Moon.' Even 'Shutter Island,' an interesting parallel from the same year. I can't emphasize enough what a great, impressive, mind-blowing experience 'Inception' is, even if it isn't really a masterpiece in the long run, once the rush of newness wears off. But see it now, while it's still at its best.",8,3,9,18 July 2010
Stalag 17," The first great WWII prison film, bordering on farce, but compact and terrific
","Stalag 17 (1953)A far reaching precursor to the Stalag 13 of television's 'Hogan's Heroes' and a bracing splash in the face for Americans grasping, still, the repercussions of WWII, 'Stalag 17' was and is sharp, funny, and compact. On one simple level, it's enjoyable as a tightly made film, period. The acting, writing, editing, and photography--coordinated of course by now legendary director Billy Wilder--snaps like a whip, and two hours goes by fast. A host of minor actors pull of major performances, and the one really big name, William Holden, has the most unusual role, and he gives it an unfriendly edge that really helps save the movie. Save the movie, that is, from a kind of frivolousness. It is, at its core, a really well made sitcom. The situation is a Nazi prison camp, not the kind of place we expect humor. And the comedy comes from making fun of the Nazis, who are always fair game. The reference to 'Hogan's Heroes' is no joke, for those who have seen that 1960s series around the same situation (even including a comic Sgt. Schultz). The producers of 'Stalag 17' sued the producers of 'Hogan's Heroes' and won. But Stalag is not just a comic romp. There are shades of bitterness that reflect a real camp--almost the kind of gallows humor you need to survive a horrible situation. And there is also a serious strand about who you can trust, about finding the traitor on the inside, and about persecuting the wrong man. Strictly a studio production, this falls just three years after Wilder's 'Sunset Blvd'which uses Holden in another embittered role, and which makes fun of studio productions and Hollywood in general. Though based on a Broadway play, it rises above any sense of being set on a stage, and yet it really does not achieve any sense of realism. It's just short of a farce. The narration at the start announces that here, at last, we will have a movie not about the front and fighting, but about prisoners in a prison camp. It announces, that is, that it will be a different kind of WWII film.And it is. Holden won best actor for his role. Otto Preminger, the great German director working in Hollywood (and bucking the censors there), plays the commandant of the prison. And Peter Graves is another prominent prisoner, a counterpart to Holden. The photography is by none other than the great Ernest Laszlo, and Franz Waxman heads up the music. It's no wonder it's a smart, sharp, snappy film. What it isn't, however, is deep or probing or moving. It's an entertainment, and a great one, but it keeps any larger expectations in check. And so should you.",7,5,8,29 January 2011
The Blind Side," Inspiring and inspired twice: Bullock, and Bullock's character. It's her movie.
","The Blind Side (2009)I managed to see this in the theater, and I think this always helps a movie through its so-so aspects. But it also magnified the really spot-on characterization of a tough, big-hearted, fast thinking southern cliché of a woman (a white woman in this case, Leigh Anne Tuohy) by Sandra Bullock. She has a compelling if not amazing support cast, appropriately maybe, for this is a kind of finely tuned television scenario, made to Hollywood standards (in the best sense). But I say this because it's true enough to help understand the feel of the film: mainstream, feelgood, well-paced, well-written. Beyond Bullock, the two boys stand out, the big Quinton Aaron and the diminutive Jae Head. And some actual football coaches show up for cameos. It's all pretty fun and at times funny and even at times tearjerky. Not bad for an everyday so-so movie.The plot is the other lynchpin holding the movie up, but also holding it back. All the personal bravery (however clichéd it looks on the screen), and the crossing of class and race lines, make for good American fodder. I bought into it for two hours. In the long run, it shines light on two pillars of mainstream American society: sports and Christianity, and both glare a little in the light. A little. The big money that drives college sports (and taints it, we presume) and the hypocrisy of ordinary folk who espouse some Christian values and not others (an old theme) are given an honest but very shallow look.There are scenes that are stretched thin, like the depictions of the projects and poor African-Americans bad mouthing Leigh Anne. But there are other scenes to balance this off that might be just as thin, but which are funny, as when Leigh Anne tells off some of her so-called friends at a restaurant. Low key, acerbic, and justified. Most of all, over and over, however improbable, Leigh Anne Tuohy 'does the right thing.' A curious (and probably painful) counterbalance to Spike Lee's idea of right.The vibe in the movie review world is that this is a core values, conservative, even (slightly) evangelical film (at least compared to some of the competition). And that's unfair to conservatives, who can't be painted or tarred too easily, and to liberals, who have big hearts of their own now and then. That is: Leigh Anne is a paradigm of someone who is both supremely comfortable, her husband dripping in new wealth, and sharply moral. Her position is not simple. She not just someone who just does good (pulling a black homeless high schooler out of the street and into her white home). She does so with subtle, cunning, unflagging compassion. Yes, she is in a position to do that more easily than most, but she does do it. She is a role model.And there are those out there who don't like to see role models come from the other side of the aisle, and so a left-leaning saint is a bleeding heart liberal and a conservative saint is a do-gooder. Shame on everyone. See this movie and flinch at its clichés if you want, but settle in to see one performance, by Bullock, that hits just the right notes. She was surprised at how well it has been received, so you may as well be, too.",6,4,6,27 February 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Easy-breezy, obvious as a child's lie.
","Shawshank Redemption (1994)The short of it: I asked some students what their favorite movie was, and some of them (many of them) said, 'Shawshank Redemption,' and I said, 'I haven't even seen it.' And they assigned it to me as homework. I started watching, and after about twenty minutes I realized I had, in fact, seen it before.That's how memorable it was for me.I also see that Shawshank has the highest user rating of any film on IMDb. What do these other intelligent, movieloving people see that I don't? I wish I could know, but I can't except by reading their comments. And here, then, finally, is mine.First of all, I don't think it's a terrible film, despite all the picking I do. I'm trying to be analytical. But when I take one aspect and think about it independently, and compare it to other movies I like, it starts to look weak for specific reasons, which is good to know. Please don't read further if you just want a confirmation of why this is a great film. In brief, I don't think Shawshank probes, invents, or seduces aesthetically. It's just a nice story well told.First, that story. Stephen King is a successful writer, to say the least, and a really good 'wordsmith.' His stories work with simple conflicts, and they are plot driven--one thing happens, another thing happens, a third thing is almost necessary to have happen, a twist, a turn, and always, from what I can tell, a nice wrap up. That's pretty much the plot in Shawshank. There is almost no depth to the characters--they are stereotypes, not made of foamcore maybe, but flimsy. There is the evil warden, of course. There is the thoughtful black man who everyone likes, played by Morgan Freeman (who narrates), and the thoughtful white man who doesn't like anyone (at first), played by Tim Robbins.Of course, it goes from there, but really, the 'twists' are old ones. The plot is the framework for something I found more irritating, and that was a slightly glib tone. The story was not really 'realistic' in any sense, though the trappings of actual prison life are all there, from rape in the back room to corruption in the front office. Maybe as a 'fable' it can get away with its airiness, right up to the final happy ending. It might not need any grounding in reality. As a fable it would naturally avoid complexity, or even anything independently interesting. What I mean is, maybe the journey through these familiar clichés, done with a fuzzy, congenial ease, is self-satisfying on purpose. And therefore Shawshank Redemption is heartwarming and enjoyable, to use two words that are as exciting together as milk and warm.But it was this breezy tone that made it unwatchable for me. I had to fastforward through a few parts in the second half (it was my second time seeing it). It seemed that nothing happening! Nothing I hadn't seen before in other movies. It struck me not as mythic or spiritual (those are words people use) but as false, as anti-meaningful because it's obvious, familiar, comforting.The film-making? Let's tick off some basics. Editing: conventional, and downright slow. You can argue the pace was leisurely and luxurious to draw the viewer in. Or you can say it's drawn out and sluggish.Music: functional and familiar, 'movie music' pure and simple, in its lush seduction, which is offputting once you pay attention to it directly.Script: hmmmm. The writing is not distracting or 'bad' especially, but that's hardly a recommendation. It gets the information across. But really, read some lines, repeat a few scenes out loud. There are those now famous lines, about everyone being innocent and so on, but most of the movie doesn't crackle--even other Hollywood heartwarmers like Die Hard have more inventiveness. Isn't Shawshank presenting Hallmark sentiments?Acting: exactly what the film needed for its pace and intentions. No faulting Freeman or Robbins there.Photography: professional. If there was a movie crying out for some great filming, this is one, with a great interior to exploit and some good night scenes. But the camera work is functional, with a few moments of higher drama (the prisoner getting shot from above, the escape sequence). But look how often the scenes are just filmed 'nicely' so that we enjoy being there. Maybe this is the idea, to be caressed and not assaulted--it's not an action adventure film, so I don't expect to be shocked. Direction: finally, the lynchpin person here needs to be accountable. Oh, I'm sure Frank Darabont doesn't mind the cult status of his movie, but he probably knows he is no auteur, but rather rode the coattails of a lot of talented craftspeople around him. But those other people all had to count on him to ask for (and deliver) something with more originality, beauty, surprise, depth, and compactness than the Shawshank we have. It's not a shame, obviously, that we have what we have, because so many people love it, really really love it. I didn't care for his other well known film either, The Green Mile, and so again, it's just what you want from your two hours of absorption.But it brings me back to where I started, which is to realize that there are all kinds of viewers, and movies to match. This one didn't go the places I need a great movie to go. It's not a bad movie, not at all. In fact, this might be a classic example of a movie being much more than the sum of its parts. But, still, even the whole strikes me as flip and easy-breezy, obvious as child's lie. It is content to be superficial, and I, personally, am not.",7,9,19,25 September 2009
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Stunning in every way...a gripping and beautiful marvel
","Birdman (2014)A tour-de-force imaginative wild ride. Every aspect has been pushed just slightly into creative territory—though you won't mistake this for an art film. It's a high budget, very slick, very approachable melding of drama and cinema, the intimate and the polished slick big drama you expect from Hollywood.I say Hollywood, but in a way this is an outsider film. The director, producer, and writer is Alejandro González Iñárritu, rising Mexican director who pulled off the impressive 'Biutiful' and further back, 'Babel.' And whatever the astonishing contributions of actors Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and the host of others (including Emma Stone), and whatever the equally astonishing contributions of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki ('Tree of Life,' 'Gravity,' and 'Children of Men' for starters) and composer Antonio Sanchez, it is Iñárritu who makes this all gel, makes it vivid, and makes it make sense. Watch all these people over the next couple decades, but most of all watch him.You might say that this movie suffers from over-production, from being too amazing, from avoiding truly human qualities and human issues by rising above and being a sensation. Fine. Skip it. Watch 'Amour' over and over. I love those movies, too, but that doesn't leave this out. It's a great example of combining the formal elements of movie-making with interesting plot and great acting. It's true that it makes a gloss of anything tender and intimate, even if at times it seems to try for depth, but overall it does what it really intends to very well.For those who do like astonishing camera-work, don't miss this. The film is shot as if done in one single long take, camera moving with cunning fluidity through rooms, hallways, streets, and theater spaces without stop. Ever. There are clearly times where a break is snuck in, or one is implied (the camera is continuous but the time of day is not, and we see an actor in front of us that was just somewhere else). But if a long take is immersive (that's its point, to create the sense of now and extend it and extend it so that you feel involved), this long take of a movie is so immersive it's spellbinding. For two hours.Add the free form drumming, which at first is almost irritating in its offbeat asynchrony, and add some stunning lighting from scene to scene, and you have an elegantly jarring movie. But then you realize, with this intense acting (all extremely well done), that the script is also superb. What they are saying and arguing about and proposing to each other in interwoven ways as this ensemble cast digs in is really interesting. It's not quite glib or flashy or superficial even if the movie has pushed it all to an extreme.Yeah, see this. A pleasure and an impressive feat.",9,5,12,2 February 2015
The Conjuring," A surprise out of nowhere, a little formulaic but well done and earthy
","The Conjuring (2013)Very very well made and 'convincing' as much as these far-fetched events can convince. The acting and filming (including some cool camera-work) are first rate, really good. And so the direction, under James Wan, deserves a lot of credit.What this movie lacks, though, is plain old originality. Somehow you might not mind, since it sucks you in fast and makes it interesting all through. But there are many movies (many) that deal with similar ideas, even with a kind of pseudo-documentary aspect built in, and with more creative aspects, too.The classic influences here are pretty well laid out. 'The Exorcist' which was shot and released during the same period this movie was set is a clear parallel. And for its own originality, and for a more disturbing aspect as well as a somewhat more 'grand' and oddly lyrical take on the ideas, that first version outclasses this one. (If you haven't seen it recently, give it a look before you doubt.) Then there are little hints of lots of other movies, various haunted house films of course, and even a nod to 'The Birds' which you'll see several times.The movie that this owes maybe too much to is the rather well done recent 'The Awakening' set in a British boarding school. It has an all too similar set of strategies, with cameras and remote devices meant to catch the spirits in a tangible way. In some ways that was a better movie, with a really terrific leading women, but this one has some extra layers of possession and exorcism that give it an over-the-top craziness by the end.What really floats this boat ('The Conjuring') for two hours is the convincing core cast playing things in a real, unsensational way (as much as you can when you're possessed and flying through the air). And here I mean mostly the two woman and the husband of the demonologist couple. (The father of the family is a bit bland.) And then there's the camera itself, which almost becomes another character the way it moves and inhabits (possesses?) some of the scenes. The photography ought to be up for some award nominations in a few months.You'll find this all harrowing stuff if you let it. It could have pushed some new boundaries, for sure, and maybe avoided some implausible aspects (people might not fall through a crumbing building with only a tiny scratch). But hey, then it wouldn't be supernatural, would it? A great summer escape movie.",7,2,5,23 July 2013
Platoon," As a recreation of Vietnam hell, it surpasses, which is both good and bad
","Platoon (1986)A movie with one goal: recreating the hell of war, Vietnam specifically but war in general. And it succeeds. It has strong acting, spectacular special effects, lots of rain and night shots (and snakes and bugs), a lot of death from every possible cause, and a steady, suspenseful pace. It's a really good movie, and at times really sucks you in.It's also a movie with lots of well used themes, with stereotypes (in the soldiers) and with more stereotypes (very cardboard, in the enemies). And there is no real plot. There is a progression, yes, and things go from bad to worse until the climax of an ending. But the development of the characters and their interactions is thin, and the mission of the platoon, whatever it quite is, lacks clarity. And a question might rise for anyone looking for a statement about Vietnam--was it really so ruthless and murderous, soldiers killing soldiers and civilians so readily? Or is this the worst of the worst? And if so, shouldn't it make that clear? Not that fiction needs to be accurate, but if we go back to the goal of showing what war is like, then this might not be what war is like. This is what a demented, blood thirsty platoon looks like, led by the evil selfish soldier played by Tom Berenger. With a couple of heroes holding things together, like the super fighter played by Willem Dafoe.There are of lots of regular guys, all of them interesting and sympathetic--Johnny Depp and Forest Whitaker as examples. And there is a ton of trivia, too, outlined in detail in the IMDb page. Director Oliver Stone wanted the movie to be realistic in the details, too, and went to some extreme to pull that off. I don't think he wanted an original movie (it's no Apocalypse Now, for sure), but he wanted a mainstream, dramatic, moving experience, which he got.",8,2,5,2 January 2010
Prometheus," I'm a total fan of Alien and Aliens, and this is a worthy pre-cursor...a visual explosion
","Prometheus (2012)Prometheus in Greek myth created man from clay. This is the key to the movie, and the original notion of this creation is told in a brilliant vivid opening sequence before the titles. Prometheus's body dissolves into the waters, his DNA disconnects, and then it reforms, as if from nothing, and a more known sense of evolution begins, with the pre-ordained final outcome being a human species. When the current story begins it is openly an exploration to find the origins of human life, which are thought to live on a distant planet.Prometheus is also the god who gave fire to humans, and this is a secondary but important aspect to the story. Not only does the space crew find hints of the creation of man, but also the creation of man's ingenuity and destructive potential. It's good stuff, well done.This story does not on the surface rely on the Alien movies but it does connect to them both in chronology and in feel. The director Ridley Scott is the same as for the original 1979 'Alien' and he's probably the best of the 'franchise,' (no offense to James Cameron and his second, also excellent film, 'Aliens'). The set design is inspired by (with acknowledgement) the brilliant H. H. Giger, which is now archetypal and remains terrific.The plot line is similar in a broad sense--a group of rag tag mostly American-seeming space travelers find this planet with some suspicious looking traces of civilization and, eventually, new life-forms. Things are not benign from there. There is the familiar inclusion of creatures inhabiting, and bursting from, human hosts and there is a great android/robot central character. And there is a fight to the end and a near death for our heroes, male female and otherwise.This gives nothing away, unless you've never seen a movie before. In fact, these are requirements for this series, because the audience is there in part to see how everything is faring. And to see how the Sigourney Weaver 'replacement' is doing. And this younger actress (Weaver in her 60s was not right for the part of a young doctor with dreams of having a baby) is Noomi Rapace and she's very good in her own distinct way. It's inevitable for awhile that she is identified as the original 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.' She is less fully filled out here, but I think that's because of the kind of film this is, where all the characters play types rather than real full blooded characters. Any attempt to fill in her psychology and inner being are short-circuited by having to survive the ongoing threats all around. And I mean ongoing and all around.Likewise for the talented Charlize Theron, who is stiff and wooden to the point that even one of the other characters asks if she is really a robot. The confirmed robot is the second main character names simply David, played with perfect restraint and cool detachment (he's a robot after all) by Michael Fassbender. Robots are complicated in nature but emotionally rather simple, and this conflict is a fascinating aspect to the film.The biggest draw, and the best reason to see the movie, is the experience of being there, of seeing and feeling the places so incredibly conjured up and atmospheric. It's amazing stuff, and the director has to share credit with a whole slew of art directors and set designers. And editors and photographers (photography being the first step in a heavily post-processed final image).Don't expect an emotionally deep drama, of course. And you'll have to look the other way at a few improbabilities, even in this world of wonderful improbability. For example, why would a billion dollar several year expedition have several disgruntled and apparently unprepared and uninformed crew members? And can someone really have a major abdominal operation and then spend the next hour running, leaping, and gasping (at least)? But if you do in fact look the other way briefly, you'll be swept away and blown away, and generally pretty darned impressed by yet another take on the confrontation of mere humans with superior species. Which may or may not be related to our own, as you'll see.",7,6,15,26 June 2012
Raging Bull," Relentless and vivid and touching
","Raging Bull (1980)A serious, black and white look at the complicated truth of Italian American middleweight boxer, Jake La Motta. It's a boxing movie, for sure, and the boxing scenes are riveting and offputting in their violence, but it's purposeful violence, and part of the bigger picture.The real story is the rise and fall, if you can call it that, of a man. He happened to have a gift for boxing, but it could be anyone with talent who faces a corrupt world and once, just once, weakens. There are other stories that have parallels to this, certainly, from Body and Soul (1947) to Rocky (1976). And of course The Wrestler (2008) has a different sport but same fall from glory. All of these films are excellent in their own ways, and Raging Bull keeps up with the best of them. Certainly Robert De Niro, as La Motta, is astonishing in his range, covering a couple decades and gaining some serious weight toward the end, and Joe Pesci backs him up beautifully.The filming in any Martin Scorsese movie is significant, and director of photography Michael Chapman keeps the dramatic light and clean use of focus (and lack of focus) in great balance. The sound is complex and interesting (both with added sounds and intrinsic ones). But most of all the story itself, with a vivid believability, is what grips you. I'm not really comfortable with boxing (I guess people can do what they want in that regard), and so a movie about boxing that gets as rough as this one does has me cringing sometimes, even more than with most Tarantino hyper-violence. But that's part of the point. A relentless, engrossing work.",9,3,5,19 December 2009
Saints and Soldiers," Great intentions, some harsh realism, but uneven writing and a few avoidable clichés
","Saints and Soldiers (2003)A World War II movie made in the 21st Century has to have something new to say, and this one attempts to do that with gritty, intimate realism. It succeeds in that, to some extent, but it also has some familiar clichés in the dialog and the general plot details which cover familiar ground.The scenario starts with some fast cutting that creates a sense of danger and drama with some sacrifice of logic. We just know things go badly for the Americans. Then it follows some stragglers who have survived, and things grow gradually more coherent. As the men come to know, and not completely like, each other, they form bonds that get tested, and there is heartbreak and hardship enough for anyone.What holds all of this up is a modern sense of full color, in your face hell. Not the hell of bloody conflict (there is a little of that here and there) but of fighting the snow and the cold and the fear of not making it, of dying. Some of the clichés really are a drag, however, such as a little cabin in the middle of nowhere where a bombshell of a French beauty is making bread by hand, a 78 record playing in the background, and she welcomes them (after a brief knife-wielding hesitation) with a kiss on each cheek. It's super sweet, but it's exactly what turns this movie into a fantasy now and then. Great intentions overrun with wishful daydreams.",7,3,6,4 June 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," You can't just call this an action-adventure-comic hero movie. It's just too intensely made and beautifully shot.
","The Dark Knight Rises (2012)The reviews are pretty consistent out there--this is a solid, worthy, spectacular third act for Nolan and Bale. And Caine and Freeman. The plot has a few big twists that work even if sometimes we didn't need to be surprised out of nowhere so many times. Most of all is the kinetic joyride through all kinds of action scenes, and a lot of strong dialog (very strong, for a comic hero movie, at least).Amazingly, the movie is preposterous in the best ways. It fulfills its intentions of being a believable but archly excessive future. The effects are naturally state of the art. Gotham, the city, is more clearly New York City than ever, which might disappoint some (it's less of a fictional metaphor to the point that we wonder why they don't just call it Manhattan, which of course they can't). The legend that goes back before Batman, and to his training with a secret order, is filled in with good details. Bits of warmth and humor pop up now and then and work. In all, it is a full blooded echo of the first two movies in the director's approach to the character of Batman.I saw it in an IMAX theater, which is worth talking about. For one thing, about half the movie was full screen IMAX projection (from a film projector, no digital) and the sharpness and scale were amazing. Amazing. It was almost too much to take in, and so in awe and appreciation I watched even the simple shots, like floating over the city, with wonder. I recommend it without hesitation.Furthermore, for this half of the movie you really will get the full cinematography envisioned and executed by Nolan and his cameraman Wally Pfister (who has shot all of Nolan's films going back to 'Memento' as well as 'Moneyball,' which is one reason that movie succeeded so well). The way the film is formatted in the IMAX sections, there is a lot of information (and action) above and below the normal area used in a widescreen movie. So in the theater you see it all. The problem is going to be on DVD you will not! You'll see the normal theatrical version released and now showing in normal (non-IMAX) theaters. This is good enough, no doubt, and the plot and editing are identical (as far as I've read), but the visual impact as well as the amount of visual information is decidedly different. An interesting problem.You already know whether you like Batman movies, the recent ones. It's a no-brainer to see this one if you do. If you haven't see any of Nolan's versions, this is a great place to start. However, it might not hurt to begin with 'Batman Begins' and move to 'The Dark Knight' and then get this one in order. The things you will miss without the background are not critical, but they're helpful. The rating is for the extra yards everyone went to make this an IMAX experience. It's beyond the beyond. But the film has some weaknesses, including some reworked ideas and moods, and maybe a little doubt about Hathaway as Catwoman, as much as I liked the idea. Still, it's a significant movie even for those who don't buy into the Batman aura. Try it. I dare you not to enjoy it. It's a wild ride.",9,4,10,27 July 2012
Ben-Hur," The best of it is unsurpassed epic movie-making, but it's a message heavy movie
","Ben-Hur (1959)Long. Epic. Beautiful.Is it also ponderous? Maybe--especially if you have seen other Biblical era epics ('Greatest Story' or 'Spartacus') or if you don't quite click with the material. Is it what you would call a good movie, or a great one? It has the credentials, including Best Picture. But it also is filled with secondary actors to support the dubious leading man, Charlton Heston (who gives one of the performances of his life, for sure, and has openly credited the director for that).The director is none other than the consummate professional, the ever-versatile and polished William Wyler. And he takes a huge story with grandiose necessities and makes it really watchable. And epic. And with cinematographer Robert Surtees (look at that man's film list!) it's certainly an exquisitely beautiful movie, and very very widescreen, shot with double sized 65mm film, the IMAX of its day.The story is of a Jewish man named Ben Hur who survives persecution from the Romans, including his boyhood friend, and becomes a master chariot driver and a believer in the peaceful ways of his contemporary, and upstart Jesus of Nazareth. Yes, the movie is supposedly about Prince Hur but in fact it's all aimed at illuminated Christ, always indirectly, but in the end with surprising power. We only see Jesus from behind, or from a distance, or in small part (his hand is shown nailed to the cross, for example), yet we feel his aura in the few scenes where his is present. His affect on Hur in their brief encounter is touching and pointed.We need to see that Hur himself is a kind of Christ figure, but a flawed one, a secondary man by comparison (which elevated the primary one further). Hur says early on that he rejects violence, which was not an especially contemporary attitude, especially as the Romans are occupying his home town. He then goes on to show mercy to the very people who want to abuse and kill him (that is, he turns the other cheek). He wins in the end not by killing, but by setting a good example, by being deeply good in the face of unfair hardship. It isn't clear he is a believer in particular, other than his deep rooted faith in his people, the Jews.Context matters here, just a decade or so after the defeat of the Nazis. The Romans are presented as the evil colonizing empire, greeting each other by raising their arms in what I grew up calling the 'Nazi salute.' Their colors and even their symbolism (a big eagle) are Nazi echoes. And the victims of the Nazis and the Romans equally are the Jews. Take this an important step further, and we see that there is a not-so-subtle subtext that the contemporary inhabitants of this area, recently named Israel, belong there. Hur even reminds his Roman friend to remember that the Jews lived there before the Romans ever came along.The movie works best as a story of power, of virtue, of Christian morality, of individual triumph. It also works as a visual and visceral epic. Scene after scene is stunning to just look at, and I'm sure in a big theater (remember going to movies in a full sized theater?) it was a true spectacle movie. We forget how important the venue is in 'getting' the movie in spatial, visual terms (that's one reason Westerns survived so well into the 1950s and are not thriving now).The themes of love, romantic as well as family love, are important here but are thin, filled with empty clichés and total lack of chemistry (perhaps on purpose for a movie with religious intentions). The writing is solid but lacks magic. The editing might be faulted for being a bit indulgent at times, letting scenes roll for their pageantry when we might rather get moving. And ultimately the acting is often more functional than inspired. In a way I respect Heston for pulling off a role burdened with stiff archetypes of the wise hero. Many of the actors are doing their level best with a script that has a message, and you can't quite get the drama directly when the message is itching to be heard, too. Some of the acting is actually a hair lame (Cathy O'Donnell, who I adore in other movies like 'They Live by Night,' is really awful once you notice her, which is really a casting problem more than anything).So I resort to nitpicking because somehow as wonderful and impressive as it all was and is, I wasn't swept away. It's not a completely gripping and moving film.Yes, there are ways of approaching this weighty classic other than saying its a dated religious picture or that it's a profound late-Golden Age masterpiece. It's neither, and both. And it's definitely worth seeing if you have a long long evening for it.",8,3,8,23 December 2012
Sweet and Lowdown," Like the guitarist in the movie, this is always second best, at best
","Sweet and Lowdown (1999)Besides the funny idea of creating a musician who never existed and having talking heads of real experts to support the idea (done better in Zelig and, more parallel, The Rutles), there is very little happening there to keep the movie going. There are a few funny lines, for sure, but many more that are either reused Allen quips or just flat comebacks. At first Sean Penn seems perfect for his role, and he fortunately plays his part no imitating Allen. But either he has so little to work with or he plays this guitarist so superficially, it never takes off, we never feel for him or his situation. The fact that he 'fades away' at the end of his career is something like the whole movie, which didn't quite form in the first place. Funny and clever the way Scoop is funny and clever--not too much.Samantha Morton puts in a great performance as a mute woman. And the music, a la Django, is unassailable.",6,3,4,20 December 2009
The Deer Hunter," Whatever its political and historical flaws, it's too realistic dramatic to be ignored. Amazing.
","The Deer Hunter (1978)Extraordinary. There is the worst of it, the Russian Roulette as a gambling game in the jungles of Vietnam and in the back rooms of Saigon. There are no restraints here. When people shoot themselves in the head, it's bloody and horrific. When they pull the trigger and survive, it has a different kind of horror, of surviving and realizing how incredible and insane this is.There is the best of it, the love between men, and between the people in this small iron making town in Pennsylvania. There is loyalty, drinking and hunting, bonding though just being there through everything, year after year.These two worlds collide because of the Vietnam War. But director Michael Cimino never makes it cheap. It is sensational, for sure, and people have complained every since the premier that the gambling scenes are exaggerated and rare, if even ever existing at all (there is no known proof of a single incident of Viet Cong playing Russian Roulette). There also have been complaints that the movie stereotypes the Vietnamese as sadistic, terrible people. The counter to that is that the movie isn't about all Vietnamese, but about these particular terrible ones.A larger point to remember is that this is a dramatic fictional movie. The roulette is hugely effective and also symbolic of the chaotic world of Vietnam. We don't need to believe it really happened to believe it happened in this fictional world. The result, the point of the movie, is the emotional intensity of going to war, of coming home, of figuring out what matters in relationships and violence. And maybe of realizing how little we really control our lives.One of the striking aspects of the film is its incredible mise-en-scene. The famous (and very long) wedding scene, the battle scenes in Nam (actually Thailand), and the more intimate bar and domestic scenes in what is supposed to be Pennsylvania are astonishing for their believable settings and details. The place this breaks down, and terribly, is when they go hunting in the Pennsylvania mountains and it looks like the rugged Pacific Cascades. Which it is--snowy peaks, huge mountains, the whole thing. It's dramatic, but it really disrupts what is otherwise a convincing world. (For people looking closely, there are glitches in the filming of these scenes, too, as the landscapes are intercut with shots of the hunters, and shots of big deer, and they don't really match geographically or even in the kind of light used.)But if you like to like movies, and want to just get sucked in and take things for what they are, regardless of their incorrectness (political or practical), you'll find one of the most disturbing and intense movies ever made about Vietnam. It comes a year before the bigger, glossier, and even more fictional 'Apocalypse Now' and the two make an amazing pair, a deeply moving statement about America and Americans.",10,3,8,17 February 2011
Fantastic Mr. Fox," For its style and verve, ten stars plus. For a story line, it could have had more depth
","Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)I never would have seen this movie, I think, if it wasn't for 'Moonrise Kingdom' which I totally adored. Directed by the same man, 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is a kind of animated or claymation production with famous actors doing the voices, like 'Where the Wild Things Are' or the more animated Pixar and Disney movies.It's not really quite for children, however. Director Wes Anderson has shown in both movies a sensibility unique in movies. These aren't just a kids cartoon movies with adult overtones (undertones?). But they aren't the sardonic and ironic adult fare sometimes seen in animation, keeping all through a sense of playfulness and innocence. Both movies are consistent, incredibly well designed and filmed, and warm without being sickly sweet.But my own preference is for the more recent Moonrise Kingdom because that movie used real actors, and had a wilder sense of exploration of the scenery with the camera. There will be equal numbers who prefer 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' for exactly the opposite reasons--it's all invented and original, going not only across fun mid-America landscapes but going underground, too. It's endlessly fun. There are villains and heroes. There is a clear sense of right and wrong, of love and even of some kind of character development.There isn't, for my taste, enough of what you just call plot. Things happen, and it progresses, of course. But it's nothing much to chew on, just further and further escapades escaping the baddies. Fun, yes, but it actually gets tiring, too. When this happens you turn to the set design and the general style, which is worth watching for its own sake. But I still wish there was more. (An example further out-- the first 'Monsters Inc.' is non-stop interesting and inventive. That's a high standard, but hey.)The voices here are big names (like George Clooney) but maybe they don't matter so much. It's not like their character, as a human actor, is embedded in the character, at least not much. (This is done more clearly in 'Polar Express' where Tom Hanks is kind of evident all along.) Yeah, enjoy the heck out of this. And you really can let your kids watch it--they'll likely love it. And you might, too.",7,3,5,30 June 2013
Lucy," Bulging with excess and pseudo-science and effects...all in good fun
","Lucy (2014)If you take the contents of this movie seriously you are very open minded—because the 'science' here is total fantasy. It's science fiction in an ungrounded, wing-it kind of liberation. That's why some reviewers hated it (see the one in The Atlantic via Rotten Tomatoes). And I hated that aspect, myself.But this is a completely cheerful kind of mindless movie on some other level. It's actually funny (laugh out loud funny) in many parts, if you're paying attention (the most obvious is when the American Indians are shown). There are wry comments and a kind of chipper exaggeration throughout that make it all kind of bright, even when crazy and deadly things are happening.There is also the kind of action-adventure pace, with lots of moving camera (some of it really good) and lots of fast edits (without resorting to montage). There is also plenty of computer graphic excess, and sometimes it's great and sometimes it's just self- indulgent and almost boring. Scarlett Johansson holds it all together well, playing the emotionless type of character she just played in last year's 'Under the Skin.' I like her! Morgan Freeman plays a scientist, a dull version of his Lucius Fox (from 'Batman'). The rest of the cast is there to prop up these two (and mostly Johansson, who is the title character), but it's worth noticing, I suppose, that there is the common Hollywood pandering to the huge Asian (Chinese) audience it hopes to seduce. There are lots and lots of Korean bad guys (all are men but one, a tattoo artist). And there is lots of shooting, both in Taiwan and in Paris, where the second half of the movie is set. (The movie is officially a French production, but is mostly in English.)The movie has pretensions, which is its biggest downfall. Instead of just being silly and fun (like 'Guardians of the Galaxy') it has big (empty) ideas to foist on us. The opening scenes of the movie set this up, a kind of fast motion '2001' beginning. (Director/writer Luc Besson admits this, sort of.) And the very last moment of the movie makes clear the concepts here are 'big.' And so the trick is to keep it light and enjoy the humor and get wowed by the effects.",6,2,6,29 September 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," It's about love, the innocence of the 60s, beautiful Maine, and a lot of amazing set design. WOW!
","Moonrise Kingdom (2012)It's hard to see anyone not liking this movie on one level or another. It's really really well made, top to bottom. The art direction almost takes front row in this one, in coordination with the photography, creating a plasticky, beautiful, fluid, and highly stylized view of mid-1960s summer camp on an island in Maine. It's breathtaking and flawless on that visual, physical level. It even breaks rules with impunity--rain bashing the windshield and then it's sunny and bright, or waters savaging the town and people surviving by hanging like paper dolls from a church eave.Okay, you should know by now that this is a fable, a fairy tale set in rustic beautiful coastal America. The stars are children even if the famous actors are adults. (You want a list, you haven't yet heard that the cast includes Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Francis McDormand, and Bruce Willis. Yes!)The first analogy that came to mind was 'Night of the Hunter' for all the slightly and playfully surreal elements in a serious story of children striking out on their own. This one, in color, is less brooding, for sure. In fact, one of things to love is the bright humor all through. It's either hilarious or witty or clever every single second. When it's touching, or even deeply moving, it remains airy and perfect, too. The references, subtle and obvious (from Tang to Boy Scout patches to nods to the movies and their romantic distillations), are part of the content. You know you are watching through a filter. Unlike, say, 'The Artist,' which sort of re-creates the past and makes it clean and bright and shiny, this invents a new kind of reality that seems to be a perfect example of the past. It doesn't just mime it. It becomes it, fresh. Though utterly false, too, on purpose. Like a memory polished in a mirror.Of the adult actors there isn't much to say. They play their exaggerated parts with restraint (a great trick) and the over-the-top plot keeps finding little things to keep it in check. The movie never quite gets carried away (though the end with the storm does push the limits, switching to an almost-not-quite black and white for awhile, beautifully). The movie does carry the viewer away, however.I saw this with my girlfriend who isn't from the U.S. and she liked the film but didn't love it. It might partly be sense of humor or taste, but I think it's partly how imbedded the nostalgia for the real 1960s is for many of us who grew up then, in the U.S. Everything was, as in the 'Truman Show,' a kind of nod to a seemingly ideal, safe, happy, ridiculously simple and moral time. Even the immorality here is limited to a touching of hands, as seen through some binoculars.The one thread that I somehow predict will become a problem for born-agains and do-gooders (no offense, to either, I think) is that there is an implicit sanctioning of teenage touching, pre-sex, and running away. I know, it's a fairy tale, but when the main boy is smoking a pipe, he isn't just miming his dad, he's smoking a pipe. When the girl says the boy can touch him where he shouldn't, he does. It's amazingly innocent, but it does imply a freedom unthinkable in the movies of the 1960s, if not in real life.By the way, this is set before the hippy 60s. There is no hint of drugs or even rock and roll. The adults as much as the kids are pure as snow. Just a bit restless and wanting more than what they have. Which is maybe the story of all of us, one point or another.See this. See this. See this.",9,23,41,18 July 2012
The Producers," Clever, bald, crazy, fast, funny and funny!
","The Producers (1968)I had forgotten how really funny parts of this movie are. It sometimes is too shouty for me, or a little just obvious in its step by stepping through disaster, but Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel are truly amazing, both outrageous and subtle, a stunning combination.It might be hard to view the movie in the light of 1968. It has some of the 1960s mad-cap element, mixed with Jewish Broadway humor, with a dash of New Hollywood liberalism thrown in. Influences of late Billy Wilder and early Woody Allen can't be dismissed, but in a way this is Mel Brooks himself coming to his own. His background in Catskills resort stand-up is clear, but he interweaves a cogent plot in a way that we'll see many times later, almost with a Marx Brothers logic (or illogic?). No, call it logic. This movie depends on actually making absurd sense in the end.Mostel of course had a whole incredible career of his own, including in Woody Allen's 'The Front' in 1976. And Wilder has a kind of legendary fame for his leading role in 'Willy Wonka' in 1971 (though his career had a small kick from the seminal 'Bonnie and Clyde' in 1967). In some ways the over the top (of course) idiosyncrasies of two side kicks help make the film the farce it is. Dick Shawn as a kind of drugged out Elvis imitator named L.S.D. (playing Hitler of course) is perfect, and so is Kenneth Mars as the German/Nazi/writer who had the whole idea of 'Springtime for Hitler' in the first place. If you aren't laughing through some of these scenes you have a gene missing for this kind of New York hilarity.The movie has taken on a different meaning now that the actually Broadway version (not a flop) was a fixture there for six (six!) years. The irony is plain, but the talent even more so. The movie is a funny take on the times (unlike the play, which is set in the 1950s) and so has a weird kind of authenticity to it. Not that you care one bit. It's just belly laughs all the way.",7,1,2,10 May 2011
Flight," A really interesting, well made movie with a terrific Washington
","Flight (2012)What starts as one thing ends up being another. And that's a great thing. This movie has several stages to it, all tied together by a terrible airplane accident. And tied together by alcoholism, plain and simple.Denzel Washington takes on the lead role with the kind of intensity Daniel-Day Lewis did for his Lincoln--it's not surprising they were both nominated for best actor. And this is Washington's movie, top to bottom. Yes, there is yet another offbeat and hilarious and commanding smaller role by John Goodman (see 'Argo' for starters), and a strong if overly restrained lawyerly performance by Don Cheadle. In truth the whole cast is believable in a contemporary, mainstream way (we can skip the woman at the start who unfortunately ends up being purely provocative and decorative, and we can admire the heroin addict played by Kelly Reilly). The director? Robert Zemeckis, who has been trying for years to carve his own way to some kind of populist stardom, like a more fun Spielberg. And his movies often fall short, I think because of their very populism--they want to be liked be everyone, and you can't quite do that most of the time. (Frank Capra comes to mind, but he's another order of director at his best, which he wasn't always.) Zemeckis is smart and competent, however, and he makes this movie roll right along with a quiet fascination for the process of NTSB investigators and alcohol tests, not the most exciting material.Don't let me leave out the plane crash--this is no spoiler, I think--which is terrific and harrowing, and with the final smartphone footage from the ground you'll be gasping. (This movie won't be used for in-flight entertainment, that's for sure.) It's exciting stuff.By the way, when you get to the end and you see what the investigators decide about the plane (not about the pilot), remember to think back to the first moments of the flight, not just the last moments. There are some questions that you might have to answer anew. A movie that bears scrutiny and some reconsidering is good stuff.Enjoyable. This is kind of routine movie-making, but well done, well done!",7,3,5,10 March 2013
Unbroken," Fabulous story, and troubling, but also weirdly bland, despite first rate filming...
","Unbroken (2014)Heartbreaking, inspiring true story, told and directed in straight up high quality realism. There is some true intensity in the fighting scenes, in the survival scenes on the raft, and in the prison camp with its torture and hardship. And this is balanced by determination and hope.If that sounds generic, in a way that fits—the movie follows some tried and true formulas. The beginning has us with the hero, Louis Zamperini (played by Jack O'Connell), in a big bomber heading for some targets against Japan in WWII. As trouble begins, leading to the crash which makes up the real start of the movie, we also get flashbacks to his simple Italian-American childhood. This is effective, but it's sentimental stuff. And it lets you know the kind of wholesome intentions of the movie.There is a lot going on here, in three main sections: running, surviving on a raft, and the prison camps. That Zamperini suffers and endures is the point of the film, and in that way the narrative is very straight forward. There are villains and buddies. The skies rain bombs and the sea is full of sharks. Some people are merciless, and others kind. But in the middle, through every turn and travail, is Zamperini. 'If you can take it, you can make it,' is a mantra in the film, and that's the message.The direction and photography were first ratevery subtle in a spectacular way (or vice versa). It's a truly fine film, and director Angelina Jolie (in her second feature, after a terrible first try) does a really good job. The story, co-written by the Coen brothers and others, based on a book by Laura Hillenbrand, is a great bit of history, quite sensational stuff.So why did we leave the movie feeling just so-so about it all? I'm not sure how to nicely say this, but it's really a good story, well told, lacking some quality of surprise or depth it really needs to rise above. As amazing as the photography and editing (and so on) are, it's all in service to a fairly ordinary kind of story. Not that this man's life is ordinary at all, but the way it develops and is told is oddly routine, as narrative storytelling.Good stuff, for sure. It's a bit hard to take sometimes for its brutality--there is a lot of graphic, personal violence--and the Japanese camps are portrayed as truly cruel (which many in Japan object to). But it's an impressive movie in many ways.",7,58,75,10 February 2015
Rear Window," A voyeuristic masterpiece of style and storytelling
","Rear Window (1954)Director Alfred Hitchcock's movies have almost always cut against one of the strongest currents in American Cinema: complete verisimilitude. Even some of his masterpieces, like North by Northwest, Vertigo, or Psycho use montage, special lighting effects, and backprojection to break out of pure believable film-making. But it's intentional. It's part of the experience of watching a movie, like watching a play, that reminds you that you are a viewer, and the movie is a separate thing, a work of art, or stretch of celluloid in a can.He even presses this point in every film by inserting himself in the movie. How can you not notice the director winking, as if to say, don't forget, this is all a big game.Rear Window makes intentional artifice the defining aesthetic of the entire shoot. And now wonderful it all works. Yes, we can totally accept it all, somehow. The events are unusual, but not unbelievable, and the acting is candid and remarkably nuanced with everyday expressions. Jimmy Stewart in particular is amazing as the wheelchair bound photographer with nothing to do but look at the neighbors in around the courtyard, but Thelma Ritter is also in top form, quirky but in a lovable, not distracting, way.The rest, outside, is all theater. We see with uncanny perfection what is happening through all these apartment windows, and so there is a dancer and a pianist and a newlywed couple and a lonely middle aged woman and a bickering couple and another couple who sleeps on the fire escape. It's exaggerated just so, partly comic, partly trenchant (who can not love the groom carrying the bride over the threshold?), and we see it more or less through Stewart's eyes, and appreciate his reactions up close. What a great set up for a movie, and for storytelling in general. And so, night and day and beautiful twilight, we learn about the neighbors and events begin to sort out and suspicions about one neighbor's activities rise. And rise higher, causing disruption among those in Stewart's apartment (including his girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly). It goes from there, always a little lighthearted, but with such visual, quiet, deft handling you just sweep along happily, sometimes joyously. The echoes of camera angles, the moving in and out in space, the layering of close views and far as he looks through his camera's telephoto on and off, all make for a steady visual pace that gives a sense of control and confidence. We know we are in a deliberate movie, and that the artifice will surprise us and delight us both. And that we will come away unscathed, but enchanted.There might be better made films, or more ingenious films, or movies that have deeper messages and funnier lines, or ones that move you one way or another, but there are few films this carefully flawless. You might say that about any number of Hitchcock films, but in fact those brief moments of montage or backprojection in those films are distracting to us now, coming in a movie of greater verisimilitude. In Rear Window, as in Charles Laughton's The Night of the Hunter the next year, the artificial style and structure is part of the movie, and we accept it and require it to remain so.",10,2,5,30 March 2010
The Purge," Painfully disappointing despite some curious beginnings...
","The Purge (2013)Well, this is either the stupidist movie ever or it's a mishmash of something audacious and creative and a slasher film with campy expectations. It doesn't make the grade as a great movie mostly because of an hour of redundant ax-wielding around a big suburban house. But the first half hour is really great—some potential here that went aground fast.The premise is clear right away: it's the near future, maybe 2021, in the United States. Once a year for twelve hours everyone is allowed to be an ultra criminal without repercussion. None. Kind of like Devil's Night in Detroit without any cops. You can murder, destroy things, be a general naughty boy or girl, and have no criminal consequences the next day. Hurray!Everything is just okay! Or not.Well, the reason this works in the first half hour is the calm, steady, well appointed believablility of the acting and scenario in this fancy (upscale American) house. Ethan Hawke plays a great regular, successful, nice Dad. His wife (Lena Headey) is a sweetheart in the clichéd way (she is sadly the typical Hollywood female, incompetent but nice to have around). They have two children in the standard mode, talented and slightly disaffected.So 7pm rolls around and the family has a fortress of a house (steel doors drop down in front of the windows and doors). So they watch on their monitors the calm and then the lack of calm on the nice street outside, at night. And things go sour badly.Okay, so a great set up. Of course, if you think about it, it's about as believable as zombies. And so therefore you can go with it if you decide to. So the public can expunge their violence by killing a few people and the other 364 days are crime free. Great. Except, well, uh, really?? Yeah, it implies that we would kill without compunction, and that the next day you would walk by your neighbor, who just killed a few people during the Purge, and say, 'Good morning Mrs. Johnson,' as if all was fine. And there is no guilt. Or feeling. Or morality. But that's if you think about it. A lot of Hollywood's idea of the future is not meant to be parsed out and logical. Look at 'The Giver,' or even (yes) 'Avatar.' Etc.So on a simpler level we have the problem of a movie that turns into a slasher film. Because the bad people do, of course, get into the house (you saw that coming) and the family tries to defend itself. This part of the movie is not especially well made, or well acted, or original. It destroys all potential, and makes it a disturbing bore.",5,6,8,20 October 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Terrific and over the top good and also more of the same
","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)Well, there is so much to be thrilled about here you can't just dis this movie as a rehash of the old stuff. It's epic and bizarre and tragic and inventive. It's funny and sad. It has some great serious and campy acting. And it carries on the plot and tradition of the first movie well. The repeat performance of Jennifer Lawrence is really good. She remains a convincing model and role model, a perfect mixture of humility, compassion, and strength when required.But way down at the bottom of it all, it does rehash old stuff. Yes, it progresses, but I keep remembering my starry surprise at the whole idea when watching the first movie. It was all so crazy and almost possible. It drew from powerful archetypal sources, from Roman gladiator battles to Nazi rallies to Native Americans surviving in the wilderness. And it was new and fresh every time. Not possible here, and I missed that a lot.Such is the problem with sequels. And yet that's part of the appeal of a sequel— a world has been created where the viewer enters already informed and invested (and in love, perhaps). You want to go back. So how do you keep the new installments alive? It was done with the Bourne movies, and Nolan's Batman movies. But it is only partly done here. Too much is familiar, and some is even a bit worn. The romances are merely continuations (the leading woman is a two-timer in a believable and touching way). The secondary characters are mostly familiar (Philip Seymour Hoffman is new but there is Sutherland and Harrelson, both terrific, and Tucci, who is a riot even the second time). The leads are of course the same, but they end up in the most familiar thing of all, the actual battle.And the battle, which is the whole last third of the movie, is the biggest weakness. We know who we want to win of course, and we don't know how they're going to pull off saving more than one hero. But it's a familiar mix of speed and luck and ingenuity. It's pure action adventure stuff, running and shooting and fighting, very well done and exciting, for sure. But it is what it is. I'm talking familiarities.What about the message here? The big theme is an autocratic militaristic government controlling so many lives, and an ordinary population where the people are wonderfully ordinary and sympathetic. The heroine feels she can do nothing to help and wants to leave with her local boyfriend into the wilderness. But she is called to action and she shows the power of not being selfish. A new Hunger Game scenario is set up and a visit to the big city with all the pizazz, and we see a sense of solidarity between Victors from previous games. The message is cooperation rules, and the games shows a little bit of the Avengers aspect, each fighter with their own power.It wasn't enough, somehow, but this is compared to round one. As a movie it was stunning in so many ways it wins anyway.",7,4,21,2 December 2013
Looper," Fabulous and fantastic and flawed deep down, but enjoyable!
","Looper (2012)A futurist romp with time travel, double and triple identities, and hot rod punk culture where everything is more like a beat up 1980 than a real 2044. The whole scene, though, and the plot, is fun, dramatic, compelling.And confusing, for sure. I think it does mostly makes rational sense (there are some things that will never make sense with time travel, so don't think too hard) and it will help a viewer to know that the whole movie is set in 2044 (as far as I could tell—not including brief flashbacks for backstory).You'll wonder about whether Bruce Willis really looks like an older Joseph Gordon-Levitt (even with a prosthetic nose). This matters quite a bit—in fact the movie needs a level of credibility all around. The weakest point, I suppose, thinking back on how it feels a day later, is that it was all fun and wild and dramatic and if you left it out there just for the thrill and the mind-bending, you'd be happy. But the rules of reality and time travel were really so loose, almost gratuitous, you had to take each huge twist as just the liberty of the director/writer Rian Johnson. And this left me a little disengaged. I mean, I was fully watching trying to keep up with it, so there was that kind of engagement. But in terms of the characters and their real dilemmas of how to stay alive (or not), I was forced to just go with the flow. The story was 'told' to me.It's worth saying that there are echoes of Terminator here—the idea of going back in time to change the future, and even the idea of finding a future leader as a child. This movie is less futuristic—more on that in a sec—and more romanticized. Where Terminator pushed the idea of the robot to an unlikely level that we could at least envision, this movie tips into telekinesis at key moments, and it's a huge stretch—pure fantasy fiction. Not my personal thing.As for the way the future is depicted? 'Looper' might not seem low budget with such an ambitious plot and famous cast. But it cut every corner possible to make us work very hard to believe this hyper future was really just sustained by a bunch of old American cars and trucks with tubes attached to their fuel tanks. That's the best they could do? Terminator went into a very high tech militarized future, which was fair enough, but what about 'Minority Report' or 'Blade Runner' or 'Brazil' as a whole range of options that actually felt like the future?Maybe these things don't matter as much to you. And maybe you don't mind a plot with lots of logical holes. Either way, go for this one. It's actually 'great' on many levels. I really liked it!",7,4,9,15 February 2014
Life," Realistic in the effect and unrealistic in the plot and what the characters have to do
","Life (2017)A meld of 'Aliens' and 'Gravity,' with strengths of neither. The underlying point here was to make this idea—a Mars life form discovered and in quarantine on the Space Station—seem possible. And the big question: then what?But they make it impossible. There are moments of reasonable acting and believable responses, but mostly it's exaggerated and sometimes just plain stupid. That is, the characters do really stupid things, given the situation. 'Gravity, for all its visual excess, was also weirdly down to earth and believable. 'Aliens' made no pretense of truth, of course, but it had actors that had intensity and depth. 'Life' it a parade of obvious clichés in the booming space movie business.It's not impossible to watch. There are well orchestrated effects, and a feeling of weightlessness that's good. The acting is a mixed bag (and the leading name on the list, Hiroyuki Sanada, is just one of the crew, nothing notable). I think it gets passable ratings because it's kind of fun, and if you don't really care about the feasibility of this life form in this manner, and you don't care if the plot is absurdly unrealistic, then go for the ride.And for the great, improbable twist at the end.",5,2,6,18 July 2017
Cloud Atlas," It's grand, funny, deep, and ambitious. But it's also weirdly flat, the meanings thin and obvious.
","Cloud Atlas (2012)It's no secret this is an ambitious film, over two hours long with three directors and scenes set in six distinct time frames over several centuries. It's also widely known that the main actors, a half dozen in all but famously Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, and Hugh Grant, each take on roles in the six different periods, with outrageously effective makeup that amount to disguises, at least from the viewer's perspective.What remains to be seen is how any one person will respond to the film. Me? I watched it all with interest and found parts, or aspects, fascinating. But I was never really swept away, rarely did I care overly for the various protagonists, and never did the philosophical message mean beans to me. It's dumbed down a bit, a little like 'The Matrix' which has such ambitious meaning to go along with all the technical feats. The grand themes, which will take a good hour to have any inkling of, center around being noble and good in a world where much or most of society is against you. That's appealing--the main characters are fighting evil in the good old Hollywood sense. As you see the rise of one of these characters into a semi-god like figure (she is worshipped in the futuristic sections), you are expected to follow and appreciate the clap-trap pseudo-religious cant that comes from this woman's mouth. I liked her, don't get me wrong, but the writing is a bit childish.What hurts the film even more is the thing that's supposed to make it so amazing and fresh--its construction in many pieces. To be clear, this isn't a set of six movies, one after another. No, we shift time zones often, sometimes in a matter of moments, often to great confusion at first. As you watch you learn how to watch, which is good, and you recognize better the different situations. But as vigorous and enlivening as this is (you really have to stay alert) it isn't really always for effect. I mean, there are reasons often for why we shift from one time zone to another, but not always in a satisfying way, It's more like the director(s) are trying to keep the audience from getting lost.You might also get a little tired of the clichés that are used in each of the situations, but in fact each individual story has its interest. Some of the scenes are downright comical, practically slapstick. Others are horrifying, ranging from a personal drama and tragedy in the mid-1900s between two composers, one of them gay, to a future-based band of primitives who are being wiped out by violent huntsmen with colorful face-paint. You can see how there are clichés in the wings, ready to flourish with the right viewers.The theater I saw this in (with digital, not film, projection) made it all look very good, if a bit sterile and 'perfect.' There were twenty people there and none of them left halfway. It's not a movie you necessarily abandon once you plunked down your tenner. But it will put some viewers off.What saves it is significant. The acting is exaggerated and fun, and sometimes quite breathtaking in its deception. And the whole filming experience is so wide-ranging and ambitious you can't help but be impressed by all the work, and all the ideas at work. See it? If you liked 'Melancholia' or '2001' or 'Tree of Life' or other films of that sort, that look fabulous and deal with deep issues, you might really enjoy this. But don't expect your life to be changed. It's too trapped by its big intentions to ever wrestle free and be a true work of art. And besides, it's been decades since a good movie has been made by committee.",7,12,25,5 November 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Fun, but not a bit awesome though it is sure trying...really hard!
","Kingsman (2015)A huge spy spoof, lots of fun, with all the usual exotic tools and locations. And it includes a spy academy section where recruits perform bizarre and impossible feats. But not all spoofs are equal. This one is a bit mashed together, ranging from James Bond references (with Colin Firth playing that kind of spy in a suit) to kids being kids (racing cars around or taunting each other like they are in high school). There is a plot, for sure, and Samuel Jackson plays a quirky bad guy with a lisp out to ruin the world via everyone's cell phones.Things never get slow. Fight scenes are over the top improbable, not in the Jason Bourne way where skill prevails, nor even the James Bond way where cleverness and a couple of gadgets comes to play, but a combination of these with entertaining excess. One woman on prosthetic legs manages to leap, fly, and cut people in half with gymnastic (c.g.i.) aplomb. The principle character is one of the recruits, played by young British actor Taron Egerton, and for me he lacks screen presence. But we are meant to relate to him, for sure, a troubled kid with immense talent who gets a chance to fix his life by becoming a super spy. OK overall.Bottom line—a great fun movie for people who already like spy movies. I'd compare it to 'Guardians of the Galaxy' but that movie is far better than this one—funnier, better effects, better spoof referencing. 'Kingsman' has lots of clever twists, so give it a go. But you might have a feeling along the way that it's all kind of 'stupid' and a little disappointing. And you might give the parallel, zanier 'Spy' a serious (and non- sexist) try...I liked it a lot.",6,2,9,10 July 2015
Jackie Brown," Rich, pulsing, dramatic, convincing, and archly fantastic, like the best of fiction films
","Jackie Brown (1997)Tarantino's films are so dependably well made--well written, acted, directed, filmed, and with great music--it's hard to not like them in the most sensual way, with our eyes and ears. Jackie Brown has everything going for it, including a straight up crime plot with some great, logical twists. The woman playing Jackie Brown is Pam Grier, the real deal, famous for early 1970s blaxploitation films, and of course included not only for her great presence, but for her ties to the scene the Tarantino was trying to recreate.Then there is Robert Forster, as amazing as Samuel Jackson, and with a more difficult part (playing a bondsman who is lowkey and subtle, next to Jackson's bad guy cool guy gunrunner). The two cops (including Michael Keaton) are great, and Robert De Niro has a small, steady role as well. If there is any one weak actor it's Bridget Fonda, and her role is to be exactly the kind of shallow, selfish person she portrays, so maybe that works, too. Does the movie transport you and sweep you in? Absolutely. Do you care about what happens to all these believable characters? Not entirely, but mostly. There is a sense of style of substance, of plot over character development here. And even the nature of the plot, mostly hinging on some money that has to exchange hands, is almost too simple for such a long movie. Yet, some of the most delicious, moving moments are just when the camera lingers on someone's face, and a reaction is slowly coming out, and it takes so long you can't stand it. This is what makes great movies, and Tarantino really has a feel for how to make the scenario really get under your skin, not through shock (the violence here is mostly out of view) but through a manipulation of the medium, the photographer and editing. I think you could study Jackie Brown the way people study Pulp Fiction to see how a contemporary film can be made. Certainly the series of versions of the same scene in the clothing store near the end, each from a different viewpoint is textbook stuff. And effective.",9,2,5,26 February 2010
Saboteur," Hitchcock has so much fun chasing such attractively evil fellows, you will, too
","Saboteur (1942)Sometimes a mix of humor and crisis can be especially moving, both more funny and more sad. I don't mean tragicomedy, exactly, the Shakespeare stuff, but just a movie about something big and yet the characters are a little silly. We can identify with them as they go to save the world.I think that's the idea in 'Foreign Correspondent,' the closest Hitchcock movie to this one in flavor, and made two years before this one as WWII was breaking out. It was a call to arms, and 'Saboteur' is a perfect continuation, firmly on American soil, of the fight to win the war by some very ordinary people. But for me, 'Saboteur' doesn't quite get past some of the slightly goofy or awkward moments, though I'll bet Hitchcock noticed and left things the way they were quite on purpose. He rarely wanted high levels of realism, at least not unbroken, and our leads here, mainly Robert Cummings as Barry Kane, factory worker, get away with little cinematic things, like hiding behind a rock and not being seen by someone standing right there. This is something to get used to in almost every Hitchcock movie. It's a little like someone is sitting and telling the story and you are picturing it, so you get the basic idea right but not all the logistics. Another early example is falling down and seeing the letters on the floor. No one acts with physical realism, but we get the information we need to continue. The astonishing last scenes (I won't say where or what) are more artifice as theater as cinema. It's great, but it's beautifully artificial.Kane, the character, is a disarmingly nice fellow, and he's the innocent man accused to wrong, a perennial theme for the director. He is both fleeing and chasing. He meets unreasonably helpful good people and surprisingly incompetent bad ones. But he represents our wanting to be helping and running and succeeding, too, in the war effort, which was becoming all consuming for the nation. It's all done with reserve and a touch of humor, but underneath it is a deadly seriousness. Hitch knew his audience wanted to be rallied, so he rallied them.The thing that made 'Foreign Correspondent' a bit better at this style is a better cast, and some funnier lines. But 'Saboteur' is no slouch--it's well made with precision as it careens through incident after incident, and it has two scenes near the end that are legendary (the one in the movie theater especially artful). We know more or less how this story might end, but we do with Jane Austen, too, and no one bothers about that. It's all about getting there. And saving the day. And falling in love.",7,1,3,7 August 2010
Moon," Curiouser and curiouser, though this might be familiar territory for sci-fi buffs
","Moon (2009)At first this will seem like a poor man's 2001: A Space Odyssey, then with a touch of the American Solaris thrown in. But it's grittier, and has an everyman quality rather than an ethereal one, and so it makes you sympathetic as well as curious.Curiosity is a big part of this kind of movie, where you are on the moon (literally) and don't know quite why, or how it works, or how it is that a single person (Sam Rockwell) could be operating this sprawling operation (one of many implausibilities you just overlook). The HAL-like robot (with the voice of Kevin Spacey, no pun there, I suppose) is made less sinister and cuter, for sure (and dirtier, a nice touch) but his role takes on some nice twists later, so in a way, there are two characters. Or maybe three, or four, depending how you look at it--I'll not give that away.None of this is flawless. If the everyday qualities make you comfortable with the lead character, they also make the tension and bizarreness less intense. There are moments when I think we should be just blown away, and yet (maybe because we've seen this in other movies too often) we are just made to perk up a little. The movie is, in fact, interesting, and it's not overlong, and so it does succeed. It just doesn't find the beauty, or sci-fi wonder, or human tragedy, of a great movie, whatever that might be. Maybe some people will discover some ideas about life and identity spelled out here for the first time, and in that case this could be a completely memorable, even meaningful experience. I hope so.Otherwise, it's still a fun, well made, different experience. And Rockwell, in the lead role(s), lets it all hang out. Impressive acting.",7,7,13,7 February 2010
Her," Thoughtful and touching and gentle, though maybe not probing enough
","Her (2013)Great concept, and not taken far enough. But great acting. And great simple filming style and structure—it simply progresses, and the 'future' as imagined in contemporary China is not so different than right now. Which makes it all believable and slightly creepy.We can picture coming to like (or appreciate) the simple personality that even Siri offers on a phone. Make it more complex and you have the danger of really liking it. What the movie does next is not so easy, yet—it allows the computer operating system to evolve, to have feelings, and to be more complex that it lets on (essentially tricking the user).So the computer takes on a personality bordering on consciousness. Or maybe not bordering. That's the deeper existential issue here. You can go back to 1968 and HAL in '2001' to get a similar version of this. But that was grandiose and futuristic. 'Her' is nearly now and the situation is extremely intimate.So the user is the rather deadpan, inward looking character Theodore, played with utter transparency by Joaquin Phoenix. The personality in the computer is voiced by Scarlett Johansson, who has a distinctive enough style we know it's her (and can almost picture her, which might help with some scenes).The arc of the movie is what it is, and takes me back to my first point: it doesn't go far enough. Maybe this won't seem true for many viewers—and it's no reason not to see this—but for people used to thinking about these things, or who are into science fiction, there will be a tame restraint here that is a little flat by the end. Not that there aren't some great twists—more that there aren't enough of them.Still, this is so compactly made and thoughtfully rendered, it's hard to imagine a better stepping off point for the ideas that drive the movie home. Watch it, and listen to it. And think.",7,4,8,1 February 2014
The Social Network," This history of Facebook is exciting--for a awhile. Lots of filler here & great script, great acting.
","The Social Network (2010)The rise of Facebook is so sensational in terms of money and culture, a movie about it was inevitable, and it came early in the game. Appropriately. Everything is speeded up in this world, and who knows why turn might make Facebook the next AOL or Nokia. And so it is quite the story. I don't think it's such a great movie in movie-making terms, however, and this flies in the face of a lot of critical acclaim. Beyond the main story line, there are lots of party and social scenes that are meant to display the changing lifestyles of the main characters (much of which is openly inaccurate). These are prolonged enough to lose their point, and after a few of them, they lose their initial interest, too. They are really meant to serve as interesting ways to have dialog about the stellar rise in members and money involved with Facebook. Because of course there is no action in a movie like this. It's mostly dialog. It's about ideas and numbers and watching computer screens. We are led through the initial moments of inspiration, possible intellectual theft, and good luck at the beginning of Zuckerberg's rise. But there are only so many aspects to this rise that can hold interest for us. It is pinned together through a more recent scene in a well appointed briefing room, as a couple of the leading characters give testimony about who really started Facebook. Flashbacks fill up the rest of the film.What to miss? The long and overly filmic rowing scenes (part of which were partly scale models, actually). What not to miss? The lead, deadpan performance by Jesse Eisenberg and the really moving performance that steals every scene he's in by Andrew Garfield. Justin Timberlake is good, too, and will be a separate draw for some. The twins turn out to not be twins--quite incredibly, a body double was the second twin and the face of the first actor was digitally inserted into the second one. Crazy stuff.The writing is superb. Aaron Sorkin is key here, making some of the dialog really virtuosic (including the first scene, a dialog in a bar between Zuckerberg and his would be never will be girlfriend, which took 99 takes, all shot with the legendary digital Red camera). The filming, as such, is really good in a functional way, and with the experienced Jeff Cronenweth in charge (he did minor flicks like 'Fight Club' and the American 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'). And Cronenweth is one of director's David Fincher's big reasons for success.Fincher is a terrific director, and you might say he made the most of a story with little real substance. But I'm not sure that's true. I just saw 'Moneyball' a second time last week and it holds up really well even though it generally lacks what you would call action, too, and was written in part by Aaron Sorkin as well. I think Moneyball, whatever its defects, is a better movie. Both movies are about contemporary society and the changing way we use computers, and the way people behind the scenes have made this true.Facebook is a story we are all destined to be affected by, whether you learn of it through the movie or elsewhere. Many people are just totally gaga about the crazy amount of money involved, the movie clicks. The title of the book this was based on is perfect--The Accidental Billionaires. So true. For me, though, I'm like Zuckerberg himself. I just don't care about money, and so the main draw in scene after scene was missing. Judge for yourself.",7,2,3,26 September 2012
The Bourne Supremacy," Fast, jittery, energetic, and a bit of a formula falling short of the first
","The Bourne Supremacy (2004)Compared to the first Bourne movie ('The Bourne Identity'), this is a more straight up espionage tale. It has many of the same elements—the rogue CIA operative who is a highly trained machine out to kill, and a suspicious and uncaring CIA—and it is packed with at least as much action, mainly car chases and fights. And it is well made, combining great photography (right from the opening shots), fast (sometimes too fast) editing, and heart pounding music to rev it up.It's dynamic stuff.But it's also fairly 'routine' in its own genre. In fact, the plot here is no longer an existential problem that matters very much to Jason Bourne (and his sidekick Marie), but rather a convoluted series of CIA plots that merely frames our here for a crime he didn't commit. It drives his actions, but with less urgency. And with unneeded confusion (confusion, by the way, not to be substituted for complexity, which can be a good thing).I also found the romance, or the almost necessary relationship connection (if you don't like the idea of romance) in the first movie really compelling—and again it is missing here. I remember when I saw this movie the first time at its release I was shocked and surprised by the limited role Franka Potente had. I like her as an actress partly because she cuts a different kind of leading female (a strong woman in a mode a bit different than Jennifer Lawrence, though both responding to the violence around them). But this will be about Damon as Jason Bourne against the world alone this time.The rest of the cast is a familiar brood of types, all welcome in their roles if not very original—the wise old spy chief ready to retire (and with some evil on the wing), a tough woman spy chief a little over her head, a sweet spy assistant who is smart but victimized, and of course the Bourne parallel characters—men/machines who are highly trained and dangerous.If you really liked the first movie (which I did) you'll probably have trouble resisting seeing this one. But crank down your expectations. If you find meaningless car chases annoying be prepared for two doozies—technically terrific as they are. And there is the basic plot, too, which may not quite be enough, the idea of fighting the unknown terrors from your old boss who now hates you enough to want you dead.",7,2,7,15 July 2014
The Great Gatsby," An artful film where artifice replaces emotion, highly refined stuff
","The Great Gatsby (2013)Unlike both 'Moulin Rouge' and 'Romeo & Juliet,' two amazing movies with literary roots, Baz Luhrman's 'The Great Gatsby' does not quite let go of reality. The effects and the general visual license throughout are in service to a very literal love story, which rules the movie.This might be what is best, but it means there is no release into this other world of Luhrman's fancy, which is the real joy (and astonishment) of the other two movies. Instead there is an utterly crystalline attention to light and detail. And to scenes that are themselves over the top and are merely filmed with ordinary brilliance. This is Luhrmann the stage director set loose, and for theatrical excess some of the party scenes are pretty wonderful, recalling (for some reason) the crazy party scenes in DeMille's 'Madame Satan' (shot back in 1930). But then, DeMille and Luhrmann are both about spectacle.I'm not sure the story, which is the heart of this, survives it all. The plastic falseness of the approach (the color and light and camera as well as the sets themselves) gets in the way of the drama, the very human and very 1920s American drama. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent, though not what I'd call transcendent, which is unfortunately what the role needs. Jay Gatsby is nothing if not a mysterious and highly idealistic man caught up in old fashioned ways. His sidekick and narrator is played by Tobey Maguire, and I usually like him a lot but here he is so detached from the action, as if playing the narrator physically, he ends up adding to the plasticity rather than the human depths of the story.Third in line is certainly the woman who has Gatsby's attention (and obsession), played by Carrie Mulligan with some deliberate force. She, also, is very good but falls into the idea of the story more than the emotional expression of it. Some of the more minor characters add to this general array of true 'characters' as if they are types, or as if they are actors playing roles.In fact, this intentional stylizing of every part into a kind of presentation of ideas, told with visual fireworks, is the point. For some people it might sit perfectly on the cusp of art film and naturalistic drama. If things got pushed into even further stylizing we'd have a piece of art on our hands, and it might have a smaller but more fervid audience. I think it might have tipped further to an old school Hollywood drama with characters who rip your heart out and close-ups that make you weep. That, however, is not possible with so much artifice center stage.So we have an ambitious, beautiful, curious movie. I wish Luhrmann could say, aloud, what he felt he didn't quite get the way he wanted. He has admitted that filming the movie was no fun at all, and I can imagine the work and attention to detail it would require. It's worth seeing if you like movie-making, or like Luhrmann's other movies.",7,3,5,15 October 2013
The Proposal," A sweet formula film that lets Bullock shine yet again
","The Proposal (2009)Well, I love Sandra Bullock, and the theme sounded good, and so I made myself enjoy those aspects of this film. But it' s formula flick. It has great laughs and some groaning moments and some clichés and silly parts that are forgettable. Not such a great film, as films go, but fun, as fun goes. That's not so much to scoff at.Oh, it's a romantic comedy, probably falling in some 'chick flick' category, and on that score it works. Bullock is frankly terrific--she plays an unlikable character and you like her anyway. She got her kudos recently with 'The Blind Side' and deservedly, but she has a whole slew of other films, most of them pretty slim affairs, where she is alive and spontaneous and remarkable anyway. Her love interest here is a flat but charming Ryan Reynolds, who often plays these kinds of parts (and has a way of making it natural, but never quite inspired). The director, one of a whole host of young women directors finally going mainstream, did '27 Dresses' previously, which put her on course here. It would be nice to see her not settling for a routine money maker, but use her ability to create a easy, funny, natural mood for something a little less superficial. That might just take better raw material.But this is what it is, and if you're in the mood to not work too hard or be too involved, this might just pass the evening.",6,4,7,15 August 2010
Warm Bodies," A further extension of the great zombie genre
","Warm Bodies (2013)A surprising, imperfect, slightly adolescent movie that has enough guts and originality to make it glow. It actually toys with being a masterpiece—but don't go comparing it to 'The Hunger Games' which has a similar audience and much more complete follow through. 'Warm Bodies' takes the notion of zombies that have a little heart, and hope, and turns it into a vaguely Romeo and Juliet story.The star, the zombie who shows signs of depth, is pretty amazing, and he makes the movie. Nicholas Hoult, who had a significant role in the excellent Tom Ford movie 'A Single Man,' comes across here with far more nuance than you're supposed to get with a zombie. And that's the idea. He plays it from all ends, the automaton and the deeply feeling youth.Across from him is Teresa Palmer who is fine, though she leaves the transcending to Hoult. Palmer's character is Julia, and Hoult's is just called R (because he can't remember the rest)hence a hint of Juliet and Romeo. (There's even a balcony scene, though they don't play out the echoes beyond that.) Julie's evil father who doesn't understand the other side of life is played by John Malkevich with familiar distinction. Well cast. Around them all is a world that is not so different from other zombie worlds— the endangered human sections and the wild and dangerous zombie sections. They are separated by a wall (just as in 'World War Z' and others) and the wall, of course, is breached. This is a given, and a good necessity. What zombies eat, and what becomes of them, you'll have to see. This movie takes a slightly different take than others, and that's its optimistic magic.But it's not a riveting masterpiece. There are some sections that just don't work outside of their core audience—young people in love. The posturing and conversations sometimes dip into obvious clichés. But not often. And the best parts are original and great fun.",7,2,3,31 December 2013
Sully," Professionally made account of a mind-blowing story
","Sully (2016)What a story! That's all Clint Eastwood needed in this case to make a compelling movie. Of course, we all know the ending to the crash part of things. And we think we know what happens to the other plot, the investigation of the crash. So this is a movie without surprises, and is mostly about recreating the events in a moving way.Done.Kudos also go to Tom Hanks, who pulls of a nuanced version of the pilot that seems convincing and sympathetic. A star playing a hero. The re-creation of the crash itself, and of the simulations afterward, are also first rate stuffâ€”gripping, scary stuff.All of this said, it's also true that this is a formula movie. It does little to get to actual depths or surprises. It includes a couple of short dream sequences that are manipulative (for those of us who remember 9/11, at least). It concludes with a two-minute wrap up where everyone says golly and a huge room full of people jot a few things onto pads of paper. And with a very funny joke, which ends the movie with a laugh.Could more have been done? Of course. But then it wouldn't have been a simple re- presentation of the facts. It would have been a creative, original work of art, which this is not.But it's one heck of a story.",7,1,2,2 January 2017
The Fighter," The boxing is just boxing, but the human story, the Lowell scene, is terrific
","The Fighter (2010)It's hard to make a boxing movie that isn't just another boxing movie, and yet it happens over and over again. The drama in the ring and the cast of odd characters behind the scenes, and the unlikely heroes that most boxers make, are great storytelling stuff. And 'The Fighter' shows it has the goods, even if it is, at is core, just another boxing movie.What makes this one special is the particular oddity that two brothers were both contenders, and the family supporting one and then (in a way) the other in their quests was quirky and often nasty in the process. Set in Lowell, Mass., this is working class America of the last two decades, filled with rough poverty, drugs, and its fair share (plus some) of small city losers, one way or another. That's why a winner, or two winners, makes such a fabulous splash. Yet the story is laced with genuine heartbreak, anger, selfishness, idiocy...and determination and savvy. In the end, something comes out of all this that makes a special case for never prejudging people. That might apply most of all to the family of these two men, with the infighting and truly narrowminded views they naturally had, almost housebound in a poor neighborhood. It's easy to point to the two actors at the center of it, Mark Wahlberg as the younger brother and a shot at the title and Christian Bale as the older one with a serious crack problem. But the rest of the cast, the promoters and the parade of sisters, not to mention the steely over zealous mother and the good guy dad, are all amazing. Amy Adams, an extraordinary talent, comes through with hardened realism as the girlfriend, as well.The filming here is very good if not conspicuous (it's no 'Raging Bull'), and the story line, hobbled a bit by the fact that it's a true story and had to stick to certain facts, is more inspiring than interesting or dramatic. I mean that in a filmic sense--the boxing part of the story in particular, of an underdog rising up, has been told too often to be especially gripping. But then, it's all handled so well, and acted with such intensity, you'll end up sucked in and impressed by the end, whatever your (and my) reservations.",7,5,8,4 April 2011
Up in the Air," A lightweight serious look at a jet age nomad, with Clooney his natural best
","Up in the Air (2009)Working with a witty, contemporary script and a casting a great leading actor seems like an easy enough bartender's recipe. And for a third time, director Jason Reitman pulls off a movie that is fresh, crisp, and sometimes touching. Thank You for Smoking was a kind of Luke warm warm up, but next came the fabulous Juno, a hard act to follow. Up in the Air is somewhere between the two in sentiment and success, not a bad place to be. It's a terrific movie at its best.I mention all three films because they have a consistent flavor. And they all build around a very serious kernel, in this case, about the loneliness of a business traveller always flying from city to city. It gets exaggerated here, but not with comic excess (as with Smoking). Clooney's Ryan Bingham is just this side of believable. When he meets a Alex (played with perfect energy by Vera Farmiga) who seems to be his female vagabond counterpart, and they hit it off, it looks like we know the arc of the movie ahead. (We don't.) The more obvious plot, about a firm that turns to iChat (computer screen conversation) to fire people, is laced with tragedy, but it is a set up for a series of laughs, too, and in the end isn't the most important element at all. (The timing is great though, talking about firing people left and right during high unemployment.)No, the real point has to do with Bingham's existence as a jet age nomad. Up in the Air lacks any sense of visual art, for me. The camera-work is professional and undistracting, but lacks some of the effective elements of, say, Lost in Translation, which has the one similarity of a the traveller in another place without possessions and with nothing really to do outside of work. Up in the Air hints at bigger potential here at the end, with Clooney in front of the departure schedule, and the camera suddenly seems to contribute in this host, and the next, which reverses direction, and then for the ending, and its surprising, cool, almost tragic certainty. A great ending.The music seems a carryover from the light, folk-tinged singsong pieces that made Juno really special, but it makes no sense here. This isn't a movie about highschoolers, or about innocence, but about either being very adult (Ryan and Alex) or about becoming an adult (as we see in the quirky and complicated third character played with precision by little known Anna Kendrick). The third thread in the plot(s) about Ryan's sister's marriage is more useful than moving, and more for comic effect than really building any depth, but it does give us a chance to see Ryan think out loud. And change. And confront loneliness.",8,2,5,6 March 2010
From Here to Eternity," So many actors and so many small moments build to a huge, dramatic reminder of the truth of it all
","From Here to Eternity (1953)If you take out the last fifteen minutes, you have a terrific drama about an ill trained U.S. Army and some of the inside rivalries and chicaneries that go on with so many trapped and sometimes ambitious men. The number of stars is breathtaking, and there are so many subplots, they are needed to keep every section of the movie sharp, which it is. That's one marvel here, is that all these disparate parts make sense and have equal power.Montgomery Clift takes on the most tragic of the men, and the most obviously brutalized. And yet, in that way he has of being vulnerable and steadfast, he makes you really feel for him. Burt Lancaster as the good sergeant is steely and strong in that way we admire, and Frank Sinatra is given another of those roles that make him a likable nice guy who gets in trouble for the good of others. Throw in Ernest Borgnine and Jack Warden, and a host of secondary actors in top form.There are two women with roles, and both shine. Deborah Kerr, in particular, gives what might be her most intense and satisfying performance, edgy and filled with inner anguish we never see. And Donna Reed plays a men's club companion girl, and she is rarely so alive and interesting. Everyone represents a type, and a larger scene is painted of lonely army men hoping for something to do, either in their work or in their love lives. One theme is rampant drinking, another is a culture of no escape. It's oppressive but it's the army, and they seem to enjoy life anyway.But then the end comes around. Pearl Harbor. It was all set in Hawaii and I should have known. I've even seen the movie before but I had forgotten completely (partly because there is a 1953 brightness to the filming, and I was thinking this was post-WWII). But it happens, and it's really moving. There are no heroics, no great war stories to be told, just a bunch of regular guys, some with hangovers, having to suddenly fight, and die, for their country. In fact, the closing scene, a brave one, really, is emblematic of the real truth to a lot of what was to come.",8,2,2,9 August 2010
Atonement," Emotionally and historically overwhelming, with a contrived twist at the end
","Atonement (2007)Wow, this is a movie begging to be classic. I liked it and wanted to love it for all the deep emotional implications, the great set designs, and the wonderful cast. The story is actually astonishing as it unfolds at first. It's about true love between two young adults, and it's equally about the fertile and misguided imagination of a girl who doesn't understand this true love and manages to sabotage it. It's also about storytelling, and about the ever-fascinating problem of World War II for the participants and the civilians caught in the riptides of its damages.That's a lot. It's enough for any good movie, and this actually has the bones of a great movie. One of the strengths is how good it looks, mostly thanks to veteran cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, who has been on the fringes of a feast of awards but never quite rises to the top of the celebrity pile here. Check his list of movies to know his serious accomplishments, but mostly watch how he deftly makes this movie vivid and moving, scene after scene.Credit of course goes to director Joe Wright who has moved from television to serious movie-making very well. And to the writer, novelist Ian McEwan. But beyond these are the actors, especially Kiera Knightly, who I find at her best here. She's often an affected actress, far to aware of the camera, but here she backs off enough to fit the tightly scripted style. Throw in Saoirse Ronan as the young writer and troublemaker, and her sister, the terrific actress waiting for her major breakout film, Juno Temple. And the one man to note, James McAvoy, is strong if not the equal of the others. (Never mind Benedict Cumberbatch, who is good but slightly out of step for some reason.)So you see the movie is loaded for bear, as we say here in the U.S. (or used to). And it soars and swoops and makes your heart patter and your heart swoon. And then I think it's up to your feeling of how the plot unfolds, and whether you believe it or not, and whether you go along with what I found to be a bit pushy and contrived. Contrived to make you cry, yes, but so obviously you feel slightly jilted. Like the date who turns out to not really like you after all, and was just out for a good time.Certainly give this a try. It might just be the best movie you've seen in a while. It won't be bad by any means. And it really is gorgeous in many ways.",7,1,2,5 March 2016
