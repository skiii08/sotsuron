Requiem for a Dream," Oh please...
","I've read a lot of reviews of this movie that cite it as'powerful,' 'visionary' and 'unforgettable.' Several critics -- including many of the people who post to this site -- have gone so far as to call it the 'best movie they have ever seen.' To them, I say -- as nicely as I can--  Oh please... On the basis of Pi, I will readily say that Darren Aronofsky is talented, but this  movie is nothing that a half-dozen film school wannabes I hang out with couldn't pull off. It doesn't take a great director to alter shutter speeds to create a subjective vision of disorientation. It does take a poor director, though, to elicit wildly over-the-top performances, present scenes that drag and bludgeon his film to death with editorialising violin music. In addition, said director should not win any points for originality by filling his anti-drug manifesto with trippy hallucination sequences that seem designed for midnight viewings at art-house cinemas, leaning back in the front row with a joint in hand. ( And no, that's NOT how I watched the movie.) For all of the sturm and drang and distgusting little details -- 'EEWW! Look at his arm!' the camera screams -- this is just another aestheticisation of the junkie lifestyle, and it's shameless how willing Aronofsky is to pull out a horror movie trick or two just to keep us from getting bored. He seems to be daring us to walk out, but the sad fact is that the horrors have no connection to the material: like Dancer in the Dark, this is just an exercise in sadism where the nasty bits serve no purpose in furthering the story. You might as well show someone kicking a puppy for two hours: I bet you could fool people into thinking that's 'visionary' also. What I saw in this movie was a facile anti-drug message lost beneath a bunch of 'ain't it cool' camera tricks and subverted by a screenplay that suggests the characters might have been happy as junkies if not for a few chance mishaps. 'Requiem for a Dream' is bad, but it's also very ordinary. It doesn't leave a lasting enough impression to be considered a spectacular failure. It's just sort of irritating, and sort of pathetic, and ultimately disposable.",Null,0,0,19 December 2000
Unbreakable," A better film then The Sixth Sense
","Watching  this film for a second time, I became convinced of something I had suspected in the first place: ten years from now, when passablr but unremarkable films like Gladiator, Erin Brockovich and Cast Away have faded from memory, Unbreakable will still have a strong following. While it would be a stretch to say that Unbreakable is one of the very best films of 2000, it certainly deserves props for its immaculate craft, as well as for the intensity of its performances. I think, in many ways, this is a better film then the Sixth Sense, if only because its story is not so transparently constructed to provide a payoff. I liked the Sixth Sense a lot, but the twist was easy to predict because SOMETHING had to happen, or else the movie was just a how-to guide for aspiring spirit mediums. If the ending hadn't turned out as it did, there would have been no point to what came before. Unbreakable also has a big twist towards the end, but it doesn't just justify the film: it enhances its scope. Granted, Unbreakable must be taken with a grain of salt: it's a comic-book fantasy, and its real-life trappings have confused some viewers as to that fact. The point is not that Shyamalan means Unbreakable to be realistic: he just observes the action realistically to set the comic book elements in an interesting new context. Everything about the movie has been constructed to echo the plotting and character development of an 'origins' issue of a comic book, and on that count, the film is a total success.    Bruce Willis has become a great and self-effacing actor as of late, and that's not a misprint. I felt he was robbed of an Oscar nomination for the Sixth Sense -- if only because his performance was more central to that film's mystery than Osment's -- and I might nominate him again this year if given the choice. He's an interesting choice for the heroo, but ultimately he's the right one: he's low-key but not at all wimpy or ineffectual. And Samuel L. Jackson is excellent in support: this is an unusually low-pitched performance for him, but he makes it work. Their rapport is phenomenal, and it drives the film. There have been complaints about the plausbility of the action scenes, and about the slowness of the pacing. I find that Unbreakable moves slowly, but that it's a build, and not a drag. I found the major action sequence at the end of the film terrifying and beautifully controlled: it expertly pressed the audience's buttons without smacking them over the head. Yes, some of the details are muddled, but in the best anything-can-be-explained-away comic book tradition. As for the ending, it IS abrupt, but it has a great 'To Be Continued' feeling that has me longing for sequels. About the only point that EVERYONE can agree on is that this is a great-looking and sounding film: everyone somewhat pithily recognizes Shyamalan is a technically proficient filmmaker.  He has a command of the camera that is thrilling, and the editing rhythms are just beautiful. There's no need to hold this against him: he's young, he's successful, and he's definitely talented. His movie is a good one, and bodes well for the future.",Null,0,0,8 January 2001
Fight Club," a cup in the middle of the sea
","as a dissenting voice against fight club, i feel as if i am, as the pearl jam lyric so indelibly states, ' a cup in the middle of the sea.'  reading through the user comments, i see enthusiastic appraisals of  fight club as a great and inspiring film, and i am baffled. i like dark movies. i like david fincher -- i thought seven was the best film of 1995, and one of the most influential mainstream movies of the 90's -- and i like 'message movies.' i like slammin' techno soundtracks, and camera tricks and crazy twists and intricately photographed carnage and subversive leanings and i love the sound of the name 'tyler  durden.' and yet i did not like fight club. i felt it abandoned its intriguing premise in midstream to become the movie its fans wanted it to be: a violent mindf*** that appeals to those who like their messages mixed and their endings Kubrickian and cryptically, deperately apocalyptic. forget the dvd packaging and 'underground' soundbites and tell me something: what is this movie about? what is it actually saying? even the people i know who liked it mumble about 'social unrest' and then just tell me i 'didn't  get it.' tell me what i should have 'gotten.' i see a director who likes jump cuts and using his large special effects budget. i see a lot of powerful images with no underlying connections besides poor overhead lightning. i hear a lot of sermonising about a generation of unhappy men but i hear brad pitt's voice, and how can i take him seriously when he says 'we'll never be movie stars or rich?' my mind boggles at the notion that this is considered the movie of my generation. sure, i can appreciate it for being all 'cool and cinematic' as one of my friends say, but it's pretty banal in terms of meaning. men hit each other to get in touch with their emotions. we all hate corporations. identity ain't what it used to be. this has all been done before, and while i appreciate the craft of this movie, isn't the proliferation of style over substance one of the things that script is railing against? that anyone could call this the best movie of 1999 is amazing.if you feel that way, then please, view one or more of the following: eyes wide shut, titus, the straight story, children of heaven, the iron giant, being john malkovich, toy story 2, being john malkovich, the insider or even south park: bigger longer and uncut. i'm sure your problem will be remedied.",Null,1,3,19 December 2000
The Others," Superior thriller
","The Others is not a great horror film, but it's an effective thriller, and as a showcase for the ever-evolving talents of Nicole Kidman, it's pretty near perfect. All this film lacks are one or two genuinely frightening moments -- there are plenty of little shivers, but nothing that puts it into Shining or Exorcist territory as far as terror goes. The script is a marvel of narrative ingenuity, though -- it's amazing that Amenebar gets away with as much as he does given the cynical, questioning nature of most horror fans -- and the photography, which deserved at least an Oscar nomination, is so stunning that it makes even the lulls diverting. Probably the best film of its kind since 'Jacob's Ladder' -- a pyschological thriller with meaningful themes and a satisfying, unforseen resolution that, rather than simply pulling out the rug from under us, imposes logic, and, yes, significance what came before. All this Meaningful Stuff, and it's also just an entertaining ghost story,like the kind they used to make in black-and-white out of great little short stories. Call it *** 1/2.",Null,0,0,12 May 2002
Mulholland Drive," The best film of 2001, and one of the decade's finest.
","a good friend of mine -- a person with good taste who I harbour no ill will towards -- hated this movie, despite her obvious involvement in its story, because she said 'there's no need to present information like that.' on the contrary, sometimes there is a need to tell stories in an original manner, without a point A to B to C progression, and when a director can manage that as skillfully as David Lynch does with Mullholland Drive, a viewer should feel obligated to go with it. understandably, this is not everyone's cup of tea, but I believe certain things to be true, nonetheless. 1) the film is not boring. even those who have hated it have cited its engrossing construction and technique. their quibbles are with its meanings and resolutions. more on that later. 2) David Lynch is an intelligent, distinctive director. Love him or hate him, he's undeniably an original. Fans will enjoy his work because his name is attached to it. Haters will condemn it for reasons of same. He's an auteur. He's a brand name. He's a filmmaker of repute, an award-winner, and a Hollywood self-starter free from the reins of studio interference. he's not just some guy putting his fantasies onscreen, an important disctinction. 3) The film adds up. Maybe not on a first viewing. Maybe not to the degree of more narratively simplistic, plot-driven movies. Not even in the way that ostensibly 'alternative' films like Memento or Fight Club 'add up' -- with enough clear exposition to connect the dots for the viewer. There's nothing wrong with that kind of surprise wrap-up: that's just not Lynch's path here. Those who pay close attention may be the most frustrated; those who guess the meaning halfway through as a joke may be correct. But there is logic. It is not a random assemblage of memorable vignettes, although it does work that way, too. It's a tightly constructed, evocative work, and it can be figured out. It begs to be figured out, actually. This last fact is the one in greatest debate. Some posters have already unravelled the film's plot and meaning -- good summaries, actually, and exactly what I arrived at after multiple viewings -- but that's not the measure of this film. As far as I'm concerned, it could make zero sense and still warrant praise based simply on its brilliantly atmospheric direction, the quality of its performances, the chill generated by its score or the nasty humour that unerlies even its most surreal moments. It would be a classic just for the way the camera prowls around corners and creates an expectation of real horror, just for Naomi Watts' audition scene, just for the performance of 'Crying' by the Spanish nightclub singer.The other ten best films of 2001 put together fall short of the combined impact of these few moments, even if you think they make no sense.  But to me, it does make sense, and not, as some negative writers have suggested in their messages, because I want it to. (I'm pretty sure I speak for the film's fans in explaining that difference.) I didn't put it together until the third time, and the four times I've watched it since only confirm my reading. I'm happy with it, I like it, and I really don't think that makes me a simpering art film snob or a condescending Lynchophile. I was entertained by a movie and wanted to keep watching it. Good for me, I guess, and good for the movie in question. It's no one person's place to hold the comments of others in contempt. The negative posts about this film are accurate to those who made them. I wish they'd enjoyed the film like I did, but they didn't...too bad. I hope they liked something else, but I'm not wrong, either. To me, Mullholland Drive is a movie that is definitely not like leaving the TV on: it challenges, frustrates and ultimately rewards. It's also so, so entertaining, so lush and sensual, so perfectly pitched in its film noir references, so funny, so original, so damned good, so Lynchian. OK fine, I'll give a little hint as to what I think is going on, but only for people who've watched it, thought about it, and need a little push in the right direction. *** SPOILER *** Coco reallly IS Adam's mom. Which means the party at the end(?) really is happening, and everyone there is who they say they are at that point, including Diane, Camilla, Adam, and even the Cowboy. Then remember the second shot of the film (Diane's pillow in close-up) and the Cowboy's line after Rita/Camilla opens the blue box: 'time to wake up now, pretty girl.' Then pull a structural switch and place all that came before after that point. **** Pretty cool, huh?",Null,0,0,12 May 2002
The Insider," One of the best films of the year.
","Michael Mann's 'The Insider' is a terrific film, maybe the best of 1999. It certainly features the performance of the year, from Russell Crowe as embattled tobacco industry  insider Jeffrey Wigand, and I thought that Oscar should have also tapped Christopher Plummer for his beautifully detailed cameo as Mike Wallace. Mann's reputation as a master filmmaker is enhanced by his work here, which is tight, uncompromising and brilliantly controlled.The almost painterly compositions of the shots and the dogged, unstoppable editing rhythms make the movie fly by even as sequences linger; a tense encounter on a driving range, an intruder in Wigand's garden, a hotel room wall that melts into a memory.Mann's use of point-of-view in the shots is consistent and phenomenally effective: almost every scene shows how subjective perspective is easily opened up by the introduction of peripheral material. the script, by the Oscar-winning writer Eric Roth and Mann himself, is crackling and taut and never once steps wrong. There's no grandstanding dialogue or poetic turns of phrase. It's just slice-of life, and the characters are all smart and sympathetic or stupid and hateful because that's who they are, not becausethe plot needs a kick in the impetus. The score is achingly lovely and also somehow completely distancing and alienating. If you haven't seen The Insider, do so.",Null,0,0,19 December 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Let the re-evaluation begin.
","Trampled upon its initial release by audiences and critics alike, Stanley Kubrick's elegant and haunting final film Eyes Wide Shut will inevitably be rediscovered by a new generation of filmgoers and elevated to classic status. It's happened with almost all of Kubrick's other films, from Paths of Glory, to 2001: A Space Odyssey to A Clockwork Orange. And yes, I AM putting Eyes Wide Shut in their esteemed company, because, in terms of pure construction and stylistic invention, it is one of Kubrick's best films. I do not pretend to grasp every thematic nuance that Kubrick intended, --indeed, some seem as oblique and impenetrable as the man himself -- but there IS value to this film's method; it's an almost totally subjective movie, personalized to its characters moods and emotions rather then the audience's. Understandably, some were put off by this method, but patient viewers will be rewarded. I think too much has been made of the the film's 'was-it-all-dream' ambiguity: Eyes Wide Shut total absurdist fantasy, but it also contains a great deal of emotional truth. The scene at the end of the film where Kidman and Cruise sit in their living room, seemingly after discussing a divorce, is one of the most realistic depictions of familial conflict I have ever seen.  By turns, I found it to be very moving and very scary, and the so-called 'artiness' of several scenes was for me a logical extension of the film's --consistent -- atmosphere. And, even if it is somewhat exaggerated in its presentation, SO WHAT? It's a Kubrick movie, so of course it will be stylized. And on that count, it's an unqualified triumph: there are colours and images here that will haunt you for days. (My favourite is the wall of golden lights at the party in the opening scene that reappears on a store front later on.) The orgy scene is unforgettable in the way that docking of the shuttle is in 2001: it's a purely original vision that defies our mos confident expectations.  I also happen to love the score of this film, and I think that the performances -- particularly Tom Cruise, who did as good a job with his cipher of a character as anybody could have -- are perfectly attuned to the material. Is it a misogynistic film? Yes it is, to the extent that it comments on misogyny rather than practicing it. Remember that the orgy sequence is perceived subjective;y by Cruise, and not by us: the horror of the sex and the treatment of the women are constructions of his own biases and insecurities. And, on those terms, Eyes Wide Shut is not only not misogynistic, but bravely revealing of certain male attitudes towards sex. I do not find this to be an erotic or sexually exciting film, but I do think its observations and implications are very interesting. Kubrick aestheticizes sex so rigidly that it almost becomes comic...and, in many ways, Eyes Wide Shut is a very strange comedy. (Tom Cruise not getting laid in a film full of illicit sex? Get a few rewrites and hire Rob Reiner to direct, and you've got a holiday hit.) I have seen Eyes Wide Shut only a handful of times, but I have no doubt I will come back to it at least once a year. It's a richly textured, thought-provoking film that was unfairly bullied by American critics, who somehow were able to convince themselves that derivative and inferior films like American Beauty and Magnolia were enmblematic of filmmaking in 1999. Eyes Wide Shut was the best film of that year and hasn't really been matched since. I guarantee that it will soon be accorded the status it deserves, and not out of sympathy for the late Mr. Kubrick: he'll just be given his due.",Null,0,0,30 March 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," 'That's a mighty fine a'pickin and a singin...'
","To steal a line from Roger Ebert's review of E.T., this latest offering from the Coen brothers simply made my heart glad. It has a bigness of heart and a generosity of spirit missing in many of their other equally accomplished, technically brilliant films, and while I cannot in good consience deem it better than either Fargo or The Big Lebowski, it is at least their equal.(It's also the most purely enjoyable Coen film ever.) Starting with Roger Deakins' photography, the film is exceptionally well-produced: it has a magical, sepia-toned atmosphere that does not so much re-create the Dustbowl of the 30's as channel it directly onto the screen. The soundtrack -- one of 2000's best selling cds -- is revelatory: bluegrass music simply rocks. The performances are all pitched towards greatness, with George Clooney at the forefront: based on this film, he's a marvellous, risk-taking comic actor who can downplay his own movie-star looks and appear foolish.  The script is brimming with dumb-witty dialogue and hilarious narrative contrivances, and the references to the Odyssey are fun and agreeably unpretentious. The film meanders along for the first half hour, giving off a relaxed, charming vibe:  it is only when the convicts meet Tommy Johnson and record their hit song that it really starts to take off. The first 'ending,' a town-hall sing-along presided over by the great Charles Durning, was the most ecstatically happy moment committed to celluloid last year. There are so many people who did some of their best work here:  Coen regulars John Turturro and John Goodman; the demented Tim Blake Nelson;  the film's fictional editor, Roderick Jaynes ); soundtrack producer T-Bone Burnett; and, of course, Joel and Ethan Coen, who prove that sometimes, being two of the country's leading and most visionary filmmakers need not involve grand artistic statements. Sometimes, it can just be a lot of fun. **** out of ****",Null,0,0,5 September 2001
