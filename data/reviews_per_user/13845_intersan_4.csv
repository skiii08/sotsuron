Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Disgusting!!
","From seeing scenes of this movie, it seemed to be hilarious. However, I was shocked, as was my family, by the gutter humor. The scenes between the 2 men was disgusting as it went on for a few minutes. The plot with Pamela Anderson was stupid as were all the sexual references. Any moments of genuine humor were forgotten as viewers were forced to watch and listen to things that seemed more pornographic than R rated. It's easy to see why Kazahks were offended by Cohen portraying them as boorish, sex-crazed idiots. Very disappointing and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who still has a sense of moral decency. This might be a good film for guys sitting around having a drinking party, but women will be repulsed.",2,36,69,3 June 2007
Cast Away," great acting, but where did the years go?
","Cast Away is a great film for the family to see together. Except for being long, it showed the resilence of a human being trying to survive. The movie jumped from Tom Hank's arrival; then, suddenly, it was 4 years later. It might have made more sense if his years on the island were divided up into individual years. In the beginning, he was at a loss as how to survive. By the end, he knew how to use his resources. In between, it might have shown how, with each year, he acquired new skills. The crash scene was really convincing. Tom Hanks managed to inject some humor into his situation. I loved the Wilson soccer ball made into a companion. Toward the end, he showed deep despair over his loss of it. It's incredible how he managed to survive on that raft he made. He seemed like more of an urban guy than some rugged survivalist. Losing his girlfriend to another man was a sad reality, but if he survived a hostile environment for 4 years, he'd survive this too.",7,0,0,31 March 2001
The Elephant Man," It broke my heart
","I only saw this film once, but it really tugged at my emotions. Here you have a perfectly sane, creative person who, for reason of deformity, has to endure the harshness and depravity of society. Thank God he was taken in by a kind, compassionate man. What was so sad was that the 'Elephant Man' who was not even known by his name, was expected to live as an outcast because of his disease. All who he was as a person or all that he had to offer was discredited. It broke my heart when he said that he was a human being, not an animal. Needless to say, I often found myself in tears for the person he was, but could not be. It has definately opened my eyes about treating people with disabilities with the respect they deserve.",10,0,0,7 August 2000
A Beautiful Mind," An Oscar winner
","I just saw this film, yesterday, on New Years Day. It was a wonderful film, very eerie, at times, but full of hope. Traveling into the mind of a schizophrenic is confusing and emotionless, at best. The twists and turns of doing so make a very eerie pattern of madness where one can't distinguish between what's real and what's not. Yet, there is real feeling for the character who, despite mental illness, went on to win international recognization. It was very hopeful in the end. I would recommend this film for older teens and adults. Fortunately, there was little sex, violence or vulgar language in this wonderful film. Older teens might feel compassion for this man which, I think, is the jist of this film.",10,0,1,2 January 2002
