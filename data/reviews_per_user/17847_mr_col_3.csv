Angels & Demons," You've got to believe me...
","I convinced my friend ,who is not really into movies, to watch this one, you don't know how much embarrassed I was , this movies is really bad, there is no action,comedy, or drama, it's a b movie, tom hanks was too lame, it's like he is some b rated actor who got the big chance in his life to make it to the top movies, and guess what, he failed, totally.as this movie was built on a best selling story, you should at least expect a decent plot, there was absolutely no plot, nth really interesting in any conversation between any two character. the main character was jumping from one conclusion to another, without explaining what is this all about, everybody in the theater was sitting without any expression, it was really a big shock for all of us.it's a waste of time and money, and what is killing me is that i paid for 2 tickets...",2,9,53,14 May 2009
Paranormal Activity," Promotion Effect
","First of all, I'm not intending to walk against the flow, but this movie is nothing as what the trailer and the critics are talking about, it's not that good, very cheap tricks even for a home video camera and the end is very silly, it was like 'ok guys lets just cut here' the only thing good about this movie was the good promotion, they did very well in the trailer,powerful internet campaign,and media played a major part to spread it world wide, but it doesn't worth it all, I think that Quarantine was a way better even though it wasn't that good either, i think its a must see just to see how media can do something from a complete Nothing.....",4,3,5,28 November 2009
The Departed," Shock!!
","when i finished watching the movie, people asked me 'what do you think??' i didn't know what to say , i needed some time to collect my thoughts and be sure of what i'll say them...this movie has everything that a good movie needs, stars , deep script, and powerful story. and what impressed me a lot, its not a typical Hollywood story story, and it has a new type of story closure.. i will call it 'Mixed ending' . The performance of jack nicholson is brilliant, one of his best roles ever... Leonardo Di caprio and mat daemon did a great job too.I recommend everyone to watch it, because it's a movie that will be remembered for along time8/10",8,2,4,27 November 2006
