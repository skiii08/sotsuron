Sucker Punch," Fun Flick
",The movie portrays itself as something a little different and that as a viewer is exactly what you get. The characters have enough personality to be of interest but none are really developed fully because of the steady pace of the action sequence that are weaved into the story line. The dream scenes are visually dazzling and the action in them top rate. The dynamic between the actresses is very much that of a team and it's impressive that many of the stunts and fight scenes were done by the actual actors in the film. I didn't find a real connection with any one of the bunch but it was a movie that was worth seeing on the big screen just for the stunning visuals. Solid Sci-fi/drama with some kick ass fighting. Worth a look.,7,2,5,18 May 2011
