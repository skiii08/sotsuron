Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Bores
","Well, I wasn't expecting much from this film, as I thought the original trilogy was mediocre, but even so, I was unprepared for the scale of boredom and nausea (yes, it is possible to mix these two feelings, as I discovered) that this film induced.Let's see, first there was the 'plot' - the federation for some reason wishes to take over some planet that no one has ever heard of. The planet, understandably, objects, so they have a war. That seems to be about it.Then, there were the 'characters', which were either selected to be as irritating as possible, or else designed to make respected actors wish they were somewhere else. The brat that was hired to play Anakin was surpassed in acting ability by the scenery, while Jar Jar would have been rejected by Disney, even on a bad day. I kept expecting him to burst into song about lollipops and rainbows. Ewan Macgregor sounded like he was forced to keep marbles in his mouth to affect an English accentOh yes, the 'special effects'. In many scenes, the computer generated characters looked jerky and unnatural, as if they were done on a limited budget (a real joke when you consider the amount this turkey will rake in). Compared to Jurassic Park or Starship Troopers, there was a distinctly amateurish appearance.But none of this will matter, of course - the film will still rocket to the top of the charts, both in public ratings and in the amount of cash extracted from the willing wallets of the groupies. Things have moved on since P T Barnum's day - now there are thousands born every minute.Lucas knew that he could produce trash like this and still make millions. I suppose few of us would be able to resist the temptation to do the same thing in his place, but still it is sad to see that he doesn't have a bit more pride in his work. In the words of Austin Powers - if you see only one film this summer, see anything but Star Wars.",2,0,1,3 August 1999
Madagascar," Predictable humour
","Ho hum...another kiddie-flick serving as a vehicle to show off how far CGI has progressed since the last kiddie-flick. OK yes, the CGI is, as you'd expect these days, stunning, and the film is probably worth watching for that aspect alone if you're into that sort of stuff. As to the non-CGI aspects of the film, it's a rather tedious affair with predictable humour and uninspired dialogue. Not even close to the wit and originality of your average Bugs Bunny or Roadrunner cartoon (of course, those were brilliant so I suppose that's an unfair comparison, since no one these days seems able to write with that level of flair or originality). I find when viewing these sorts of films that it helps to imagine what they would be like if the images were all hand-drawn as in the pre-computer days. Would the film still hold your interest? In most cases, no. Still, Madagascar is probably a good way to entertain the kids for an hour and a bit, but you should probably bring along some mental baggage of your own to keep your mind occupied, since this film won't do it for you.",4,3,6,25 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Good story, good effect, let down by script
","I'm not a Star Wars fan - no, not even the original trilogy, which I actually saw in a cinema when it first came out (so, yes, I'm in the over-45 category). But I suppose it's impossible to live anywhere in the industrialized world without knowing hordes of people who *are* Star Wars fans, so I was more or less forced into going to see SW2 when it came out.Actually, I was pleasantly surprised in a lot of ways by this film. The alien settings are truly spectacular and original, the effects are, as you'd expect, exceptional, and even the story line is involved enough to be interesting.There are two things that really let this film down, though. The first is the script, which once again demonstrated that George Lucas is much better at making money than writing. Page after page of wooden, stilted dialogue, poor puns and cliches and other attempts at humour. If Lucas actually thought up the plot (which isn't half-bad), he really should hire some professional screen-writer to produce the script. It would have improved the film manyfold.The second problem is the acting, particularly that of Hayden Christensen. Actually, I can't quite make up my mind whether it's Christensen's fault or whether he was struggling to make something of the horrendous lines he was given to say, but there are a few points in the film where he is called upon to show some true emotion and he really doesn't pull it off very well.The other actors do a reasonable job, although none of the characters really has much personality. Someone like Han Solo is really needed in the these first three films to give a bit of life to the cast.Star Wars fans will, I suppose, love this film. For the rest of us 'true' sci-fi fans, we shall continue to wait until someone actually has the courage to spend as much on a *real* sci-fi film as has been squandered on Star Wars over the years. Anyone out there game enough to do a decent job on, say, Asimov's Foundation Trilogy? Aw, please...",5,0,0,18 May 2002
Saving Private Ryan," A disappointment
","Like several of the viewers whose comments appear here, I was expecting great things because of all the hype, but was rather disappointed by the film when I actually saw it. True, the opening and closing half hours are very violent, with no holds barred in showing us the horrors of war (but let's face it - is there anyone out there who doesn't realize that war is horrible?)I think one of the main problems I had with the film was that is was yet another of those nauseating 'America won the war single-handed' type films (there were no references that I spotted to any other nation's contribution to the D-day landing). I also found the story line rather weak - the idea that a team of men would be dispatched to find one soldier just because his brothers had been killed is hard to swallow. Tragedies such as that must have occurred many times in WW2, and I can't imagine the military would go to those lengths every time it happened.The script is also rather weak - for most of the middle part of the film, very little happens, and the scenes where the soldiers try to give deep philosophical insight into their feelings about the war just didn't grab me.Sorry, but it's only a 5 out of 10 for me.",5,0,2,22 September 1998
Titanic," Technically brilliant, let down by the actors
","I resisted all the hype at the time this film came out, and managed to wait until it appeared on TV before seeing it for the first time. It was a profoundly impressive film, but only in certain respects. The plot was thin and predictable (well, I suppose in a film named 'Titanic', the plot pretty well *has* to be predictable), and the acting was fairly mediocre. I guess what I found so impressive was just the overwhelmingly good job that was done on making you feel like you were right there. Everything from the simulated aerial shots of the ship at the beginning of the film, right through to the close ups of events during the disaster itself is done so well that you can immerse yourself (if you'll pardon the joke) in the experience.It is just a pity that the acting from most of the performers didn't rise to the occasion. It is easy to see why none of the film's 11 Oscars was for acting. I suppose I'm a bit biased because I personally cannot stand DiCaprio, who can't act to save his soul, but I found the other performances to be less than the film really needed.Overall, though, the impressive technical achievement in bringing Titanic to the screen outweighs the human shortcomings, giving the film a rating of 7/10.",7,3,5,24 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Very silly
","Silly. Very silly. Very, very silly in fact. The script still has the vocabulary and creativity of an impaired third-grader, the acting is either so far over the top (in the case of the emperor) or devoid of talent (in the case of Anakin) that you want to barf at times, but the movie is saved by the fact that it is so (unintentionally) funny in so many places that you stay awake in anticipation of the next howler. I suppose if you're one of these sad people who drool over cornflakes packages containing light sabre mazes and sacrifice a goat to the shrine of George Lucas that you've built in your attic you would find the film stunningly brilliant, but for the rest of us who see Star Wars for what it is (a rather plain kids' space opera), it's just harmless mental froth. Yeah, worth a viewing I guess, but put the brain on 'low' before entering the cinema.",5,12,23,31 May 2005
Final Destination," Good one!
","A very enjoyable horror flick - well worth the price of admission. Comparisons with the Scream series aren't really appropriate though, as although there are a few moments of black humour in Final Destination, the emphasis is on mystery and suspense. I think the film's strongest point is that it really never lets on exactly where it's going, even at the end. (OK, that could be said of a lot of films, but in Final's case, it's intentional!) It kept me on the edge of my seat more for this reason than for any shock/horror value (although there are a few gory moments, but these don't dominate the film). Probably the most lasting effect the film will have on you is to make you very nervous about getting out of bed in the morning...",7,0,0,28 May 2000
Fantastic Four," One of the better comics adaptations
","After reading the 'professional' reviews I went to see Fantastic Four with some trepidation, but the film is much better than many of these reviews would lead you to believe. The casting for the FF themselves was spot-on, and the film develops their personalities and relationships brilliantly. This is also the film's only real flaw - although the scenes showing how the Four adapt to their new-found powers and how they relate to each other are enjoyable, too much time is spent on this and not enough on developing the adventure itself. Victor von Doom's transformation to the evil Dr Doom is done fairly well, but Doom himself doesn't really come across as the towering evil genius you expect from the comics. There is none of the egomaniacal posturing or the grand 'Who dares to challenge the magnificence of Doom?' type lines we've all come to know and love from the comic books. Overall, though, the film was a pleasant surprise and well worth watching for anyone who has read the comics. For anyone who hasn't but who has the capacity to return to their childhood for a couple of hours, this is a good introduction to some clean, comic book fun.",7,1,3,25 July 2005
Contact," Top marks
","Contact is that rarity among films, and especially among sci-fi films: an Original Idea. It is a fusion of a novel written by a scientist (Carl Sagan) who devoted his entire life to the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence, and the dedication and genius of a film crew that lovingly transferred Sagan's visions to the big screen. The result is pure magic - anyone who watches this film and is not moved must be devoid of imagination. Besides being excellent science fiction (that could turn into science fact at any time), it is also a ruthlessly accurate depiction of the short-sightedness of government officials and mankind in general. Should contact of the sort described in the film ever occur, the various reactions of everyone from religious fanatics to the secret service are very likely to be exactly as shown in the film. This accuracy is no accident - as a scientist and lobbyist himself, Carl Sagan no doubt encountered all of these reactions in his own life. Besides being a fantastic story, Contact could also be viewed as a 'future documentary'.Truly one of the best films; no, not just that - the best *concepts* of the decade.",10,0,1,15 August 1999
