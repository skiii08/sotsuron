Angels & Demons," Could have been better
","This is a movie i was quite excited about. I loved the book for its intricacy and the fact it kept you guessing. Now while i knew what to expect from the film, as yes, it did follow the flow of the book pretty much perfectly, it left out crucial parts of the plot, things which thickened the narrative and made for more dramaitc plot twists. I felt a lot of Vittoria's plot line was left out, and this let me down, as her storyline provides the crux of the book (mostly).All in all, it is an enjoyable movie, it sure as S*** did not feel like 2+ hours as it moves with good pace and flow, but when it says 'Based on the novel by Dan Brown' it really means loosely based. I still fail to see why movie makers cant stay truer to source material, Peter Jackson proved it can be done with LOTR, and such widely accepted books like Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons which have a great fan following, the films should be far more reflective and true to the books.Good movie, but could have been better",6,1,2,22 May 2009
Ocean's Twelve," Please watch the movie
","Please watch the movie.Do not watch the script.Do not watch the camera work.Do not watch the acting.Watch the movie as a whole, have some fun, stop crying cos you felt you were short changed. Grow up and learn that people have different tastes, things appeal one way to some, and one way to others.I loved Oceans 12, funny, and enjoyable. Possibly a brain on the seat next to you movie, but just plain fun. My comment may not sway your opinion, but i do hope that you can learn to just WATCH THE MOVIE!",10,2,6,14 June 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," Just Plain Fun
","This simply follows on from the last 2 movies, both of which i throughly enjoyed.The movie industry falls into the overall category of entertainment, and thats what i expect from a movie. And with the Oceans trilogy, thats what i get.Oceans 13 is a fun movie, not overly worried about critical praise, but more or less on telling the story, having the twist and turns we are used to from Danny and his crew, and all the while stealing some money.The heist is just as good as the last two, with intricate planning done by all involved. The execution fantastic, and the tastefully witty script that i have become oh-so-familiar with.If you liked the Oceans 11, and Oceans 12, this is a must see!",9,1,6,10 June 2007
