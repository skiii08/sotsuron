Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Thoroughly entertaining
","I'm a huge fan of the 'Pirates' series, and although I had my doubts, I must say that 'On Stranger Tides' was wonderful. The movie had a COMPLETELY different 'feel' to it, and the story is new, with lots of new aspects, but it actually worked once you got used to it. It will be very easy to add on to it, with a more broad open-ended story. The cast, although with many additional characters, worked very well together. Johnny Depp was phenomenal as Jack Sparrow as usual. He wasn't necessarily the strongest character of the movie, but his humor, wit, and acting style were just as great as in the last 3 movies. After seeing the first three, his audience feels like they know his character, so even little personality quirks are hilarious without him even trying. He truly shines as good ole Jack!The plot was not as complicated as in 'At World's End,' but it was interesting none the less. I feel like the movie definitely could have been EVEN better if the newer characters were given a little more depth, or even given the chance to show more of their on-screen chemistry with each-other. Sometimes, the motives of each character to get to the Fountain of Youth was a little blurry, and in a couple of scenes, the characters talked VERY quietly, or mumbled/spoke too quickly to understand what they said. I absolutely LOVED the scenes with Jack and Barbossa together-- SUCH good chemistry + hilarious! Blackbeard was a good addition as a villain, although he wasn't near as 'mean/cruel/wicked' as Davy Jones was. The characters of Philip and Syrena were a little on the weak side. Philip needed much more to his backstory to make me feel attached to him, but he still did a great job.All in all, the movie was GREAT. I loved it, and it went above and beyond my expectations. I will forever love CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow!! Go see it if you liked the others!",10,0,1,22 May 2011
Bridesmaids," I'm seriously confused.
","OK. After seeing the previews of this movie, it was added to the list of movies I did NOT have any intentions of seeing. However, I heard so many great things about it, I decided to give it a try. Let's just say, my gut feeling was correct. I have NO idea what so many people found so amazing about this movie.It's not that funny. Yeah, there were a couple of scenes that I found humorous, and chuckled. However, most of the 'funny' scenes were either involving sex, about sex, about poop/vomit/farting/burping, or a lame attempt at slapstick humor. Lots of predictable cheap shots. Seriously, no sophisticated or classy humor... the whole film made me feel trashy, honestly. I get that it's rated R, but still. I felt like I was in an adult version of an equivalent to Spongebob at times.Small plot. This movie is slowly stretched out for over 2 hours, with a plot that could easily be explained entirely, with all important scenes, in about 30 minutes. There were SO many long scenes that seem to be thrown in just so Kristen Wiig can score another laugh, yet they don't progress the story. Quite a few plot holes, and there were many scenes where I caught myself rolling my eyes, thinking, 'really?' The greatest movies develop their characters so much that you literally feel for their outcomes. I left the theater with no regards to any of the characters in this movie, because they were all so distant and under-developed. The plot was so weak and rushed for the next pointless comedy spiel, that they didn't give the characters any depth, except maybe the lead of 'Annie.' I can think of 2 memorable scenes right now from this film, and I saw it last night. Yeah, there were some funny scenes, but nothing worth raving about in my opinion.I do have to give 'Bridesmaids' some credit. An all-female leading role movie is very new in show-business, especially in comedy. Sadly, these women made the 'Hangover' equivalent instead of raising the bar, but they get Kudos for the efforts. There were some sweet moments in the movie, that for me, held the film from turning into a complete waste of money. I do like comedy, but I prefer classier, witty humor instead of the easy, thoughtless humor. I would much rather watch a movie that evolves a character so much that the cheap shots aren't needed for laughs. If you liked 'The Hangover,' then you'll probably enjoy this movie..",3,495,922,15 May 2011
