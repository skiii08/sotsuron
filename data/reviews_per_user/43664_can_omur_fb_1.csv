Conquest 1453," I think
",This film is very fantastic.I am Turkish and this film about history of the turkey.This film is very beautiful and informational but some of the film was very bored.Clothes suited for that date.War scenes was very nice.I know everything was very hard at that time .I think this film is more realistic than other Turkish films.I think they spent a lot of money for this film.This film was very beautiful so I went to two times to this film. I think this film should take the award.This film is very exciting. Finally film is very beautiful so I suggest everybody this film.by bekircan certel,Null,4,19,3 April 2012
