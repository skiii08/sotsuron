It," Very good but could have been scarier
","I really enjoyed the movie. However, I wish it was a bit scarier. It: Chapter 2 looks like it won't disappoint in that department. I like movies that pay homage to the 80's and this one did a very good job. It also looked scary and I think that skarsgaard did a good job bringing it to life. I am super excited for chapter 2 and hopefully it brings the scary moments up a notch.",8,1,1,25 August 2019
Bird Box," Great movie. Gives me hope for Netflix again.
",I loved the movie. The story was great. Excellent special effects. Kept me on the edge of my seat and was not predictable at all. I didn't know what was going to happen. I hope Netflix comes out with less original content but better original content. I had lost hope for a while after watching some of their originals but lately there have been some great ones. Quality over quantity Netflix. Bird box is a great movie.,10,1,6,19 January 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Not as good as Infinity War.
","It was good but mainly because of the humour and a few key moments. There were a lot of parts I did enjoy but also a lot that I didn't. Fat Thor was hilarious, but I also hate how they kind of ruined Thor. Come on..... like Thor is a god!!! In the first Thor, he eats like a pig (in the diner) and is still hungry. After battle, they pig out at banquets and get drunk. Yet Thor is always buff and ripped.... why?... because he is Thor!!!!! A GOD! Can he even put on weight? It was still hilarious to see Thor fat but when I saw it in trailers and stuff prior I thought it was a bonus scene as a joke..... not in the actual movie!! So that was disappointing. In my opinion they totally ruined the character. Tony Stark was cool. Captain America they really fleshed out which was good. Ant Man was great and funny. The Hulk they kind of ruined as well but he had a lot of funny moments. Honestly, Disney really seems to be taking the SJW approach to most things which really just ruins it because it is so blatantly obvious. In addition to making a lot of the men either overweight chumps or just really wimpy. It is just getting a bit tiresome because it is like this in every Disney movie now and its becoming so predictable. I liked Jeremy Renners character and how they brought more depth to Hawkeye. I thought Bucky should have been the next Cap and not Anthony Mackie. I guess they have to find a way to give Falcon super strength. Captain Marvel is still lame. No personality and so overpowered it is just dumb. Scarlett Johansen was really good. Still shocked they actually killed her off to be honest. I liked the Scarlet Witch. That fight scene was really cool. Doctor Strange is still awesome haha. I liked how the sorcerers used their powers at the end to save everybody from the missiles. Nebula played a huge role in the movie which I was not expecting. I like that actress a lot. She is really beautiful and I liked her in Jumanji so it was nice to see more of her in Endgame. I am pretty excited for the next Gaurdians movie if Thor is in it. Hopefully, he loses weight and becomes Thor again....... because the whole fat Thor thing, while hilarious!... really ruined the character in my personal opinion.The movie was still really fun. However, I am more excited for all the individual movies now because they honestly do a better job of showcasing the characters. Endgame was really kind of all over the place, focused a lot on humour, and while doing some of the characters huge favours..... it really ruined quite a few of them for me.Still excited for the rest of the MCU and I hope Sony and Disney can sort it out because the new Spider-Man franchise is really good.",7,1,2,25 August 2019
Get Out," Not what I expected.
",I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. It was listed as a horror yet didn't really seem that way until about halfway through. I hadn't watched any trailers previously nor did I really know what the movie was about....... all I knew going in was that it got really good reviews. I was very surprised at how good it was and I was on the edge of my seat right up until the very end. The acting was really superb I felt. The movie had really creepy tones throughout but I still could not figure out where it was going. Finally at the end they have the big reveal and it all comes together. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and am looking forward to watching US after watching this. An intelligent thriller with great acting and great directing. The music is a great addition to the creepiness and I really liked the goofy best friend.,10,1,5,25 August 2019
A Quiet Place," One of my favourites
",I really enjoyed this movie. It felt like something new that was more independent and original than a lot of the thrillers out there. I liked how it kept a lot of the traditional family values and had a strong male lead who portrays in my mind what a man and a father should be. You don't find that much in Hollywood nowadays. The theatre was so quiet which was a nice experience compared to the usual explosions and loud noises from most movies. Well acted and well directed.,10,0,1,25 August 2019
