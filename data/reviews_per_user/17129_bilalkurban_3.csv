","It is a movie about World War II again. There are two many films about this war but the difference of this movie is the place where the story took place, Holland. The actress in leading role shows great performance throughout the film. In fact the acting was great all film long. Nevertheless I advice you to watch this film. My vote is 7.The main idea of the film is that one can not trust anybody.Anybody can be a spy. In order to guess who is spy, while watching the movie sometimes I felt like watching 'who is murderer' film. A Jewish woman who was a singer and dancer before the war, succeed in running away from Nazis by having saved by a union resisting against them. The union gives a difficult mission to the leading actress that she will charm top level leading man of Nazis. She manages the mission but something unexpected occurs. She falls in love with him, like Stockholm syndrome.",7,0,2,26 June 2011

","Yesterday i watched this movie once again. The film lasted in about 3 hours but i never got bored. This movie is very fluent and acting is great. Especially Denzel Washington act so well that i admired him. To me, the most impressive scene was frank's mimics talking to white drug seller boss after assassination attempt. It is interesting that while watching the movie i wanted Frank Lucas not to be catch by the cops although he poisoned people with drugs and caused their deaths. It can be said that the mixture of ex-boss mafia style and the Italian's succeeded until catching. If loyalty of Frank's relatives would be as strong as the Italian's ones the ending would be so different. But wearing a spectacular fur given by his wife as a gift was the biggest mistake of Frank Lucas that caused to be catch later.",9,1,2,15 February 2012
