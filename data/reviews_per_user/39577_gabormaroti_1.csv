Blade Runner 2049," Why you shouldn't read the bad reviews
","It's crazy to see some people give it 8 stars or less. Because even if there wasn't a story at all, the film should still get a 10 because of its visuals and the sound (can't judge the acting as I don't think I'm in the position to judge the acting).Again, the visuals and the sound are absolutely mesmerizing. Should be almost forbidden to watch such an epic movie at home on a little screen with some little sound boxes. It would be a completely different experience, like day & night. Again, do not watch this movie at home when you see it for the first time. This is really important. It almost shouldn't be allowed to leave a review if somebody didn't see it on the big screen ;).To me, the first Blade Runner was a little bit more mysterious, I guess most were very surprised that Deckard was a replicant too. 2049 puts you much more into the position of trying to find out what is happening and why. Matter of taste whether you prefer this style or the other of Blade Runner 1, where you were more in passive mode as a viewer.Blade Runner 1: far ahead of its time, great and surprising ending, great visuals and sound, left you thinking about what consciousness is..2049: unbelievable and absolutely unmatched visuals and sound, more active thinking about the whys during the movie.. I guess, the first movie had such a big impact because of the questions it raised.. 2049 raises similar questions, but the questions couldn't be accompanied by better visuals and sound. It's crazy. For almost 3 hours, I really felt like I was in the future.",10,5,16,15 October 2017
