Marie Antoinette," Disappointment...
","A few things to point out:Plus: + Beautiful wardrobe + Beautiful buildings and sceneryMinus: All the audio: - The music: The movie has today's music, but the movie is set in the 1700s. That's actually the first thing I thought when I started watching it. I was thinking 'what the heck is with the music'?! - The spoken language: It was a mixture of American English, British English and French. It was weird that Marie spoke American English even though she was from Austria where people speak German. They could have made her speak with an accent or something to make it more believable. Same with the other characters.",3,0,1,22 March 2007
Stardust," I absolutely loved this film!
","This movie is magical, beautiful and funny. It has the elements I like about a movie. Surely this is not action sci-fi, but I bet a lot of guys would still like it. If you're considering seeing it, you should. I wasn't sure if I really wanted to see it at first, but I'm so glad I did! It became one of my favorite movies of all time :)So the movie itself is about a young man who goes on a hunt for a fallen star to give to his loved one, so that she would marry him. He has one week, otherwise she will marry another man. On this journey, the man does find the star, but the star is actually a young woman. They fall in love, and the star shows him what real love is.",10,0,0,8 January 2008
A Walk to Remember," Very good!
","This movie was surprisingly good. I thought it would be a teenage movie (I'm 26...) but it really is great for everybody. I don't know anything about Mandy Moore except she sings, but now I know she can act, too. Anyway, this movie was very good. Jamie (Mandy) is a daughter of a 'priest' who falls in love with Landon (Shane), 'the bad boy', after they start learning an act together. This movie was beautiful and heartfelt, deep. Towards the end you find out that she has a leukemia which she dies from in the end after she gets married to Landon. The reason I gave 9 stars out of 10 is because of the sad ending (otherwise 10 stars). And the last 30 minutes of the movie really keeps your eyes wet, at least mine, and I don't cry that easy. Well, you just have to see this movie if you like to reach out for tissues.",9,1,2,4 February 2006
