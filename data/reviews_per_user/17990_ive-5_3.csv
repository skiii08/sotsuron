Ali," Mann does the impossible in the best possible way
","Mann has tried to do the impossible: to make a bio pic about one of the most charismatic people of the last century. This enterprise, everybody will agree, could have utterly failed so easily. In my opinion, Mann has done the impossible in the best possible way. Mann's movie is flawed, of course. But could anyone have done a better job ? I doubt it.Will Smith is not Ali, but he does an amazingly fine acting job. He does not ooze Ali's mesmerizing charisma - how could he ? -, but he does bring depth to the role. Michael Mann remains undisputably a director of genius. It does not show for the whole length of the film, but it does in many parts. The cinematography is, as one would expect, magnificent and the boxing scenes are the best I have ever seen. This is a moving tribute to a remarkable man. Make sure you see it. My score: 9/10",9,0,0,12 March 2002
Pi," What's pi got to do with it ?
","Boring, confused and badly paced. Shallow intellectual basis (and  there is supposed to be one). What's pi got to do with it? Nice camera work, but that is just about it. Rating: not even approximating Pi, I'm afraid.",2,4,6,4 August 1999
The Insider," The Mann is Mozart (well, almost)
","No need to dispute what many have written. True, the performances are first rate - as one would expect from people like Pacino, Crowe en Plummer (though Crowe deserved special mention.)True, the movie is longish (but feels fast paced nevertheless.)What has not come out in many reviews is that Mann really succeeds in submerging the audience in the sinister force field that is out to destroy the Wigand character. Mann really pulls it off to make the spectator feel part of the drama - as a spectator, but one residing within the movie as it were. The brilliantly creative camera work and editing are reinforced by a restrained but effective soundtrack. As in Heat, Mann shows once again that he is close to being a cinematographic Mozart.",10,0,0,29 March 2000
