Marie Antoinette," Equal Pros & Cons
","Although it moved quite slow (okay - very slow), I loved the sets, costumes, and mood in general. I would like to see it again after I've re-read some of the stats and general story on Marie Antoinette. I think I might appreciate the movie more. I'm a little rusty on my Antoinette history. There were subtle comedic parts as well as very dramatic moments, but I found myself sighing during much of the movie. I recall a moment where we're watching characters walking up the lawn steps to the castle, and this moment seemed to drag on forever. Also, the anticipation of a hot steamy love scene ended in a disappointment for me.",5,0,0,27 October 2006
