Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Please let me be cool!
","Tarantino was the kid at school nobody liked and he desperately wanted to be cool. His movies reek of this desperation.Some parts are cool and some parts are very contrived, this movie was mainly contrived. I thought the visual effects were decent but they lacked credibility. Its hard to believe a skinny Uma Thurman is going to chop up all those people with one sword. Or that she can defy the laws of physics and escape being buried alive.The acting was nonchalant, nobody seemed to care that much - but I understood that that was the point. But then I didn't really like anybody, they were all so two dimensional who cared if they died? Nice try Tarantino - haven't seen a movie out of you for a while. Hope your sabbatical is indefinite.",1,7,12,14 September 2008
Meet the Fockers," Pointless sequel to 2nd rate movie
","There really was no point in trying to milk the cash from this cow. It dried up with the desperate attempts of Stiller to create a movie with a few memorable scenes. His career may depend on 3 scenes per movie, but do I have to wade through the effluent to get to them? Are they ever worth it? The humor was bland, so Stiller was at his finest. Being the 'likeable' guy what an amazing twist for one of his characters. Nobody came out of this movie with even a mediocre performance. I wish somebody benefited from this movie, I really do. Spiritually or intellectually - because it failed so dismally in the creative stakes - somebody had to have been possessed by some force other than greed to make this 2nd rate baby snot.",1,4,5,26 September 2008
School of Rock," Jack Black plays Jack Black - again!
","Woohoo! I cant believe my luck! I get to see Jack Black play the same annoying humorless limpet as he always does. Maybe this time he will actually 'act' or maybe tell a 'joke' or set up a humorous 'scene'. But no. It was not forthcoming. I was patient, I waited through the whole movie and still nothing.Did middle America make this movie? It was conservative, stuffy and lacked creativity. I didn't see a single unexpected twist or clever line or even a decent performance (most of the actors were children - so Jack had the advantage of experience).Please stop Jack Black from making anymore movies about his rock and roll exploits, if he wants to be a funny musician then he can team up with Jankovich or stick with Tenacious D - the movie format doesn't work with the lameness of Jack's humour. He needs a radio spot I reckon - just keep him away from a camera. Please.",1,12,34,14 September 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Revenge of the CGI software!
","Take a beautiful idea, add tons of CGI with a little dry acting and forced melodrama and sell it like a cheap bicycle at a flea market. Thats Revenge of the Sith.If you like CGI then you will not be disappointed, but I've played computer games - I know what CGI looks like - FAKE. So it doesn't belong in movies to the extent that 80% is CGI. Why bother making a movie with people if so much is CGI? Make an animation and be done with it.The acting was below par, I expected more but the shoddy storyline didn't demand too much (battle over evil etc. etc.) I was very disappointed with everything in this movie. George Lucas needs to take a look at himself as a human being.",2,11,21,14 September 2008
