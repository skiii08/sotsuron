The Ring," I have not been this scared since I was 6.
","The most terrifying moment of this film was the scene involving the 1st victim of the video. I experienced every frightening moment with the girl as she opened that door. When she saw what was inside I felt like having a heart attack, right along with her. The most incredible scene in this movie was showing the first victim in the closet. I can not get the profane image of her head rolling to the side and that blank stare. In fact, I can not get to sleep at all because of it. Tonight all the lights in the house are off. It is hard to think of this as a movie and not an urban myth that might come true in the real world. The ending was also a surprise. By far the best movie out this month, and I guarantee this will be a new cult classic.",10,0,0,19 October 2002
