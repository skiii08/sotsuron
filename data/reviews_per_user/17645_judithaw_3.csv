The Finest Hours," Unrealistic to the point of laughable.
","This should have been a good film. There was an interesting and action packed tale that could have been told. Alas, it was not to be. It wasn't terrible but it could have been so much better. The romantic storyline with Holliday Grainger should have been a minor detail, not taken up a third of the film. Her character was so annoying and wimpy, you just wanted to give her a shake and tell her to shut up. What really killed it for me, though, was the lack of realism with a lot of the scenes at sea. For the most part, the coastguard boat was sailing along as if it was in smooth seas. Despite this being a massive storm, they hardly moved. As a sailor, this drove me nuts - even in moderate seas, boats move back and forward. And in storms, they move a lot. The crew of both vessels involved would have been getting thrown around not calmly staying upright. It wouldn't have been hard for the filmmakers to have made this a bit more believable. Save this one for a rainy day, when you've nothing better to watch.",4,0,0,15 January 2020
2012," Why the low ratings?
","I don't get why so many people hate this movie so much. I just watched this on Netflix for the first time since it's release in 2009. I liked it back then and and, yet again, thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was - a rollicking good yarn, with great special effects that kept you on the edge of your seat. Come on folks, lighten up, this isn't high art and doesn't claim to be.",8,4,7,30 December 2018
Mama," I'm glad I didn't pay to see this!
","I saw this on TV as my mother has a box office feature as part of her TV package and I'm so glad I didn't waste my money and time going to see it in the cinema. It's not the worst attempt at a horror film I've ever seen but for me it was mediocre at best.The special effects were pretty bad. The entity that was 'Mama' looked so fake I almost laughed out loud and I actually did laugh during a dream sequence where the girls' father appears from beyond the grave appealing to their uncle to save them.The film got off to a very slow start and didn't really speed up much. The acting was alright but the actors had a pretty dire story to try and bring to life. To be fair, there were a few creepy 'it's behind you' moments but I won't be looking over my shoulder anytime soon. Without giving away the ending, I was left asking myself how they were going to explain away the carnage to social services the following day!We rented this movie because of the Guillermo del Toro connection and I'm still scratching my head wondering what that was exactly. The only mention of him seemed to be the 'Guillermo del Toro presents...' heading at the start of the opening credits.My advice... save your money and wait till it comes on TV if you really want to watch it.",3,1,4,1 July 2013
