United 93," Documentary at beginning.... but the end...
","Before we get inside the cinema , everybody who just saw it came out crying. We were like ... what happened here? We knew its a sad movie but never realized it could have such an impact on me or my mother.This is a documentary based on the happening on September 11. There is none one second of bore-hood in this movie and everybody watched it in silence. As seeing the real documentary on Discovery channel we already knew a lot of things. But the director did something out of imagination. The last 5 minutes where so intense in the movie that i almost started to cry. But when the people got inside the pilot cabin , somebody yelled : 'Get he's hand off the wheel' and we saw that he pointed the plane toward the ground.... i simply burst-ed out crying... so hard that i was ashamed at a point that the other ppl in the theater might see me but when i glanced offer is saw that literally every single one was crying. Then it was over. Not a soul moved for several minutes.This is by far the best Documentary/Movie ever created based on a true story.Go... watch this... and think...10/10 Paul Greengrass you rule and there are some people who judge you by making money from a tragedy but the people must know what happened there and you managed to put it in the most original way.",10,2,4,4 October 2006
