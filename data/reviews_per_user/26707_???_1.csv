The Blair Witch Project," UNREAL!!!
","This movie wasn't so scary as I watched it as it was afterwards. I was on edge during the show, but afterwards I was staying at a friends place and I was the last of us to fall asleep and I was freaked. I think the effect of seeing the movie at a midnight showing also helped scare me. It wouldn't have been the same had I left the theater and it was still light outside. I loved this movie and I want to see it again. It is worth it spending 10 bucks to see. And guys it's worth paying 20 if you like to have your girlfriends grab onto you during a movie, this will do it for sure.",9,0,0,9 August 1999
