Marie Antoinette," A really, really long music video
","There may be 10 pages of dialogue in this picture, but I wouldn't lay money on it. It works best when approached as a sumptuous, very long music video. The editors do a fabulous job of saturating the eyes with gorgeous colors and shapes while mixing an almost unbroken soundtrack of '80s Goth and New Wave hits along with opera and incidental music. The successful mixing of these elements is the only saving grace of this otherwise historically inaccurate and ultimately dull film.While the insane pressure of 'getting an heir' is adequately explored, the rest of Marie Antoinette's life is left relatively untouched. We get glimpses of set pieces in her country house or on the stage, but none of it is put into any context. By film's end, anyone without an intimate history of her tragic end will be left relatively cold.Buy the soundtrack. Skip the film.",2,1,2,21 September 2008
The Fifth Element," So promising; so disappointing
","It would be wonderful to see the same cast do the same film under different direction and with a somewhat improved script. There is so much potential here that it's positively maddening to see it wasted.The actors do a wonderful job overall, though Gary Oldman is so comic book character that it's almost embarrassing. Poor Chris Rock is stuck with screeching, 'Oh my god!' about eight thousand times -- certainly someone could've come up with something more interesting than that to liven it up?Milla Jojovich is completely likable and does a great job shifting through the various shade of her character. Bruce Willis -- well, he's Bruce Willis. Ian Holm is brilliant, of course.Note to big-time movie makers: putting the bad guys in big rubber suits is not particularly intimidating for the viewer. It's distracting and downright silly at times.As high on my wish list: never ever ever cast a non-musician in a musician's role. The poor woman trying to play the diva was utterly ridiculous in her attempt to look like she was producing the exquisite tones coming out of her mouth. In addition, for all the hype about the diva, it was only a letdown when the makeup and costuming effects were so-so and her phenomenal voice was augmented, not by incredible and imaginative visuals, but by silly hand movements and very un-diva-like she-bopping.The sets were eye-poppingly real and then suddenly cartoonish. Big ideas walked right alongside trite ones, constantly bringing the picture down. Entirely too much time was spent on the opening sequence, and other pacing issues bog the film down. Unexpected plot surprises kept piquing my interest, only to disappear in completely predictable good guy/bad guy set-ups. Please, someone, remake this film with a coherent message and the ability to make it all hang together.",3,13,29,6 April 2008
Brokeback Mountain," WHAT a letdown
","After all the years of hype, I finally decided to see this film, even though it's a Western (I generally hate Westerns). Ang Lee did indeed create some gorgeous cinematography, and the acting is out of this world, particularly Heath Ledger's phenomenal characterization.Regrettably, I found the movie as a whole totally boring and ultimately frustrating. It's supposed to be some fabulous love story -- where's the love? I get the passion and the strong, undying physical attraction, but that's a small piece of what love is. Love isn't about periodic idyllic getaways with a lover -- that's a vacation. It's easy. Love is the everyday slog. Every day, re-forging your commitment and somehow making it play out. Both men were complete failures in that regard, perhaps because they were with the wrong spouses, perhaps because they weren't with each other. The fundamental problem with the picture is that it doesn't make that clear.The men lead two completely separate lives -- one where they're with their families, and one where they're together. Perhaps if Lee had shown some overlap, the love aspect would've been more believable. Perhaps if there had been more conflict and more tenderness in the men's time together rather than just companionable silence or awkward sex, it would've demonstrated what a real love relationship was like.Ennis' terror of discovery was completely believable and real. Yet that terror doesn't excuse the lack of love demonstrated on screen. His affection for his eldest daughter was more apparent than his love for Jack, even when he and Jack were sharing private moments.I was greatly disappointed in the film. It was lovely but too slow, and ultimately torpedoed by its glaring omission of real love.",2,2,23,12 February 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Flow chart, anyone?
","The Good:GREAT cast. Some nice costumes (though I've honestly seen better on Xena). Good score. Great bloopers. Moments (fleeting) of genuine interest and/or pathos.The Bad:What was UP with the plot??? I spent most of my time totally confused. Characters deviated massively from previous direction. Depp's characterizations (I hesitate to call it 'acting') were less energetic, focused, and purposeful than previous versions. Too. Many. Freaking. Explosions. We have seen it, seen it, seen it. Likewise 'sticky' sound effects and 'gross-out' humor. The absolutely pointless folderal of making Elizabeth the pirate king and then having her turn all her power over to men and then -- what? Pirate king? No idea what you're talking about (the plot devise disappeared). The ending -- pick whichever one you like, it was emotionally unsatisfying.The picture showed some promise by taking a much darker turn than the first two, but the plot was so impossibly & ludicrously tangled that it sank under its own weight. And after all the time we've invested in the various characters, to have so many killed off or otherwise sidelined, not to mention the ridiculous fate of Will -- I just don't even have the words. A betrayal of the audience. These are supposed to be old-fashioned adventure flicks, not Wuthering Heights, for pete's sake.Take Frank Capra's advice and cut the third reel. Focus on tight plot and development of characters along pre-existing arcs. Have some strong, compelling over-arching value that the plot is connected to. (The value could've easily been 'freedom' but it became 'freedom from this confusing mass of explosions.') SHOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF ACTIONS. Elizabeth's near non-reaction to her father's death, and the fact that it had zero impact on her relationship with Will, was one of only a bajillion examples of plot grenades launched at the audience.A good pair of scissors, or perhaps a flow-chart of Current Betrayals on the left side of the screen, could have made all the difference.",6,3,4,31 August 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Great film; I'll never watch again
","This was a fabulous picture with some slow-moving spots (hence the 7 out of 10). I wish the description of it had been more accurate. I was expecting more fantasy sequences, not so much focus on the Spanish war.What makes me not want to see it again was the brutality depicted. It was very realistically done, not sensationalized, which made it all the more difficult to watch. I had to close my eyes in parts, not due to squeamishness, but because I didn't want the images of barbarity seared into my brain.I had some difficulty relating to the movie entirely because of the subtitles, but that often happens with 'foreign' films. Overall, this is an extremely well-made picture. Not for children!",7,1,11,8 June 2009
The Bourne Identity," People like to watch people kill people
","Or at least, that's what I took away from this movie. It has all the elements of the 'spy' 'thriller' 'action' movie: the guy who can't remember his past, The Girlfriend, the inexplicable relationship between them, the rest of the cast almost exclusively white males, The Car Chase, The Heist, the use of gadgetry, the oh-so-cynical political manipulations, the relative lack of dialogue, and killing after killing after killing. We've seen it all before. All of it.Except...*how* people are killed. This picture is particularly inventive in its use of violence. I can't account for this picture's popularity aside from this one difference.Most of the time, Matt Damon looks like he's playing a Jedi -- he goes through his 'action' sequences without even seeming to breathe. He practically looks bored. Perhaps he feels the Force. I never thought I'd say this, but Tom Cruise actually looks like a talented actor in comparison. His 'Mission Impossible' was much the same flick as 'Bourne' but had far greater intensity and emotional involvement. Which brings us back to the creative use of violence. I found it ineffective, ultimately, as it seemed to wrench the viewer out of what little realism is going on. Perhaps real-world assassins are just that cool (how much black leather can you fit in one movie?) -- going out to 'do the job' and never feeling emotional or psychological consequences. Never using all their creative skills to *avoid* violence rather than revert to it as a first step.Didn't much care for this picture. Don't need to see it again.",3,1,3,18 December 2008
Dreamgirls," Hang in there for the second half
","While a huge fan of the Dreamgirls soundtrack when in high school, I never saw the stage version, so don't know how closely the movie follows the staged version.So, speaking strictly about the film, I found the first half or so to be bewildering fast and shallow, with no character development or even a pause for breath. The songs were pale imitations of real soul, Motown, R&B -- even the blues piece was weak! Since there was virtually no dialogue, there was no sense of identification with the characters. It was very difficult to know what each character was actually thinking or feeling. This was especially frustrating when the picture made reference to social issues of the time yet didn't even follow through with the characters' reactions to them.The second half of the film was much more compelling, largely due to better placement of song material, additional dialogue, far greater dramatic range and tension, and more clear character development. If this is a good adaption of stage show, I think it's a mediocre Broadway show and probably fares better on-screen where emotion can be conveyed more subtly through close-ups and long edits. Jennifer Hudson was the most consistently real character throughout the film, and burst through the role. Everyone else's performance paled in comparison. Eddie Murphy played his part easily, skimming the surface, until the very end when we suddenly saw the depth of his acting ability -- made me wonder why he wastes his time on inane comedies when he's capable of such depth!The pyrotechnics of the sets and the lavish attention to detail on period costumes and make- up helped cover the mediocre quality of many of the musical pieces. The ending was too neat, too sewn up for my tastes, but at least it was over quickly!The picture is definitely worth seeing for glimpses of the Motown story and the compromises and flat-out rip-offs that were part and parcel of the African-American music scene until recently. The trip through time visually is entertaining, even though the music and lyrics come nowhere near the accuracy of the eye candy. Fast forward through the music numbers at the beginning and then just hold out for Jennifer Hudson and the character development in the latter half of the film. It's worth seeing at least once.",5,0,1,23 May 2008
Stardust," Odd adaptation of Gaiman's story
","This picture couldn't seem to find the right bits to adapt from Neil Gaiman's original story. Gaiman's version is much more adult-oriented (showing the sex between two characters, for instance). Overall the film is 'family friendly' but it has some graphic elements and bad characterizations that I don't think are appropriate for kids.The male lead is an Orlando Bloom stand-in but does an adequate job of playing the earnest and unlikely 'hero on a quest.' Claire Danes is, well, Claire Danes. Robert De Niro does the worst acting of his career in his completely unbelievable ship captain's role.There are a few poignant moments in the picture but overall I found it oddly jumpy and unable to settle into a coherent storyline. Not one to see again.",4,2,7,14 June 2009
School of Rock," Fantastic performance by Jack Black
","So the story is tired, the characters predictable, and some of the dialogue totally lame -- who cares when Jack Black is exploding off the screen in every scene??I've never cared for Black as an actor (and I don't know why, but he's struck me as a bit of a jerk off-screen) but in this movie he gives all performers a model for what it means to be 'committed to the role.' He's so committed, so over-the-top, so genuine, that I suspect this is really Jack Black, not a character.As others have noted, the sheer exuberance of Black coupled with music that, for those of us in a certain age group, remains utterly, primally FUN is a combination that's tough to beat. Too thin to be watched often, but unexpectedly delightful all the same.",6,1,1,1 April 2008
Meet Joe Black," Great acting hampered by terrible pacing
","It's amazing that Brad Pitt, even at this young age, could hold his own with Anthony Hopkins. The fact that they make a great team is even more impressive.While Hopkins plays a pretty standard '60-something businessman,' Pitt plays death itself. This film presents a more intimate view of Death's trying to understand Life than the old flick 'Death Takes a Holiday,' so we see Death try to understand things at a very personal level. Pitt is perfect in the role, showing a charming innocence along with the necessary amount of gravitas.But the picture is severely hampered by its pace, which borders on the Jurassic (the epoch, not the epic, Jurassic). If this had been edited much more tightly, we'd move briskly through a beguiling and thought-provoking story. Instead we're treated to affected dialogue (which the actors valiantly try to overcome) and tediously long takes that give us plenty of time to lose interest.Kudos to Hopkins and Pitt; onions to the director.",3,1,3,7 February 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," If you care about democracy, see this film.
","Friends, Romans, countryfolk/cityfolk (as ye may be):Just got back from seeing 'Good Night, and Good Luck,' George Clooney's movie on Edward R. Murrow and the McCarthy era. It's one of those rare movies that leaves you speechless at the end and which poses questions so subtly that you hardly realize how provocative it is until it dawns on you how much you're thinking about it.If you care about democracy, see this film. If you also care about excellent film- making, see it on big screen. This is a work of art as well as a completely absorbing story about a time with eerie parallels to our own (though the '50s had much better fashion and soundtracks). This is not Michael Moore bash-you-over-the-head film-making -- it's taut, intelligent, moving, and visually/aurally stunning storytelling. An important work about standing up and speaking out -- and the price everyone pays.",10,1,2,2 July 2006
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Best of the series, yet still only an average film
","The Harry Potter series remains a story in search of a director. This installment is the best yet, incorporating key story elements to move the plot along and new scenes & touches to cram in some character development, but it all leads to an ultimately disappointing climax and denouement.The supporting cast is, as always, phenomenal. It is *criminal* that this much brilliant talent is assembled for only the briefest screen appearances. You can tell their talent by how much they wrench out of every second of screen time.Radcliffe has matured nicely as an actor, but Yates' emphasis on action, action, action prevents Radcliffe from holding center stage as much as one suspects he could.Rupert Grint has finally moved out of clumping 'block of wood' mode but has so few lines and action that he still comes across as a cipher. Why would anyone find Ron Weasley interesting??? What does he actually *do*? I daren't ask what he *thinks,* since he so rarely evinces evidence of that, whether in the books or on screen.Emma Watson seemed on hysterical overdrive for much of the picture, to the point where I couldn't understand her lines at times. Her outstanding prowess as a witch in the books is completely lost in this film, where she appears as just another student in Harry's class.'Order of the Phoenix' is essentially an action film, and as such, it fulfills that role to a T. Shallow characters, very short scenes, fast edits, heavy use of montage, hints at relationships rather than exploration of them, focus on high-drama pursuit of an Ultimate Goal, and then - - the inevitable falling flat. One of the great things about the Rowling books is that they make *consequences* very clear. Children are still children, no matter how brave or clever, and need caring adults to help them deal with emotional and physical bruising. The scene in the Dept of Mysteries was, in the book, a completely gripping experience as, one by one, the characters took serious blows.In the movie, however, following the convention of almost every action film I've seen since the original Die Hard, there are virtually no consequences of what is supposed to be an epic magical, emotional, and physical battle. No torn clothes, no bruises, and none of the serious injuries that made the scene so frightening in the book. It's the presence of the consequences of violence (think Sarah Connor in either Terminator movie) that makes a good action film great. We have to see that these characters are human -- which means that they are vulnerable.And, as in all the other pictures in this franchise, there is no exploration of the emotional toll such battles take. Sirius' death scene was so sanitized that it made no impression on me whatsoever, except to wonder if Yates' scene of Harry's reaction and the ensuing 15 seconds of slow-mo footage constituted plagiarism of Lord of the Rings as Frodo (far more effectively) reacts to Gandalf's death.I have my usual laundry list of minor peeves, such as poor Evanna Lynch's thin acting abilities compared to the giants around her, and especially the Christmas scenes where everyone is saying, 'Merry Christmas' -- only Mrs Weasley says the more Brit-appropriate 'Happy Christmas.' (I do detest how these films dilute the cultural specificity of the books.) The ending, like most standard action films, leaves us with a forgettable closing line that is as emotionally satisfying as a twig in a cup.Overall, I was willing to overlook the hacking and slashing of Rowling's epic (I'm used to it by now) for about 3/5 of the picture. Imelda Staunton made an outstanding, ever-present, puffy pink noose that kept tightening around the throats of our heroes. I even appreciated Yates' throwing in some lighter moments to keep the film (like the book) from getting claustrophobic. But with the total emasculation of the Weasley twins' spectacular departure (I actually cheered when I read the book; in the movie I just kept saying, 'Hunh?' and waiting for some sort of statement to be made), the picture fell into all the traditional ruts of any standard Hollywood-type action film. Special effects over substance. Superhero abilities given to our previously human characters. Predictable climax (only, in this case, add 'confusing' because it was changed so much from the book -- for the worse), and lame & unsatisfying denouement.I wish they would give these films to someone like Terry Gilliam or Baz Luhrman, who are capable of creating multi-textured stories using every tool in the filmmaker's toolbox: script, actors, sound, costuming, lights, sets, score -- all used to tell the story. Instead we're stuck with directors who think only in two dimensions and deliver 'standard' adaptations of Rowlings spectacular, visionary tales. Such a tragic waste.",3,1,2,13 July 2008
The Artist," Absolutely delightful
","If you're a fan of old movies, or even if you've been afraid of being put off by them, 'The Artist' is a great way to ease yourself into the medium. The size of the screen, the typefaces, the quality of film, the gestures, all the graphic design, the sweeping score, the dazzling acting -- all of it is pure vintage Hollywood.The lead's smile is pure Gene Kelly but his style is absolute Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Tremendous style and panache. Poppy isn't nearly so true to the art form (I was disappointed to see that no woman bit the back of her hand, the standard indication of horror, surprise, or shock in the silents!) but is still winning as George's true love. The picture is primarily delightfully comic, with even a terrier-like dog reminiscent of Asta from the 'Thin Man' movies, but has elements of pathos borrowed from 'A Star is Born.' The story bogged down a bit about two-thirds of the way through, but quickly got back on track with driving energy reaching a wonderful finale.My last point is merely a comment on what a treat it was to go to the movies and not be jolted in my seat by the sound of explosions or experience sensory overload with special effects. This picture is easy on the senses and sweet on the heart. Give it a try.",7,0,2,11 March 2012
Inside Man," great plot, bad direction
","First, this film is not a 'thriller.' Neither is it 'gripping, taut.' It might have been so based on the script, but the direction's slow pace makes it difficult to get into.The plot itself is very interesting and ingenious. Unfortunately, we only get a sense of *how* ingenious after the picture is over. That leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with music playing over them punctuated by some action scenes that don't grab the viewer, and 'cunning vixen' scenes that inject a little more overt intelligence.I wish this had been the fast-paced thriller the box promised. It would've been an outstanding film. Instead, Spike Lee made it plod along through the end.",4,1,5,17 July 2009
The Holiday," Standard romantic comedy with above average prettiness
","Lovely sets, some interesting lines and concepts, and a few good acting turns. But overall your standard romantic comedy. The only real surprise is an all-too-unusual setting for Jude Law's character.In the DVD extras, the director commented that Cameron Diaz reminded her of Carole Lombard. It was a connection I'd not made before, but it was immediate obvious once heard. But perhaps Diaz's occasionally gleefully spastic performance was due to the director's pushing her in the Lombard direction.The cast was outstanding but under-utilized with a 'so close but not quite' script and average direction. Everything seemed to move towards a resolution or breakthrough but then stop short for no apparent reason. Overall, absolutely average -- fluff for a brainless day. The eye candy of sets and actors help it along. Would be wonderful to see the same cast on a film with a better script and director.",6,1,3,21 May 2008
Love Actually," Wild ride of emotions & situations
","How I view this film depends on what mood I'm in when I watch it. The first time I viewed it on DVD was during an extremely lonely holiday break, and I was devastated and drowning in Kleenex before the opening credits were finished. My most recent viewing found my reactions sliding all over the scale as the various story lines unfolded.Each storyline is a different type of romantic genre -- everything from 'Beavis and Butthead' humor to painfully exquisite, understated drama (perfected by Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman). One of the strengths of this approach is that, if you don't like one style, another will be coming along presently. This is also a weakness.Each vignette has its own strengths and weaknesses, but the majority of the threads are strong. All the characters, no matter how outrageous, are likable. Weaving the stories together takes a very deft touch, and this is where the director missteps most often, with forced transitions that are jolting and confusing. For instance, the story opens with a tight focus on a black man; I'm pleasantly surprised to see so many people of color on screen. But it's not until the end of the picture that the character reappears (after a wild ride of story lines and emotions), and the shocking realization that we've been watching white people almost exclusively for the rest of the picture intrudes on the storyline. The opening and ending shots of Heathrow are extremely compelling because they show love manifesting in *people* -- not just trim, glamorous, white 30-40-somethings. It would've been nice to see that theme carried through the film with more diverse casting. Not just to make a more universal story, but to help ease the plot challenge of interweaving the many characters and story lines.As others have commented, the nudity in the picture was often a hindrance. While it did work to contrast our notions of 'sordid porn' with the downright 'aw, shucks' innocence of the characters playing it, the clash of vulgarity and innocence was often too powerful to be anything but distracting and sometimes offensive. It was certainly gratuitous.This is not standard 'let's shut off our brains Sunday evening and just veg out to a brainless romantic comedy' fare. If you've just gone through a break-up, don't watch it. But if you want to contemplate the many manifestations of love, or just have a technical exercise in different forms of romantic genres, enjoy an evening with this.",7,2,3,27 July 2008
300," This *so* wanted to be Gladiator
","I think this picture is best watched on fast forward. Lots and lots of slow-motion battle/blood sequences and 'vista' shots, punctuated by dramatic narration and occasional bits of dialogue. It was nice to see Miller translated to the screen, and I really enjoyed seeing so much of Spartan history restored, but overall the picture is about visuals derived from Gladiator and (less so) The Matrix.Where they went wrong on history, they *really* went wrong, such as implying that only the Greeks (Athenians) practiced pederasty. It was actually part of Spartan training. And this whole idea that Spartans were free and democratic while everyone else was a slave is just plain wrong.I *loved* the queen and thought they got the role of Spartan women more accurate than most historical films do. Unfortunately, they did fall quite short of reality. The whole 'come back with your shield or on it' is true but overall, Spartan women were much more tough than portrayed in the film and just as comfortable in their bodies as men. Athenians were scandalized at Spartan women's assertiveness, flashy dancing, and short skirts (legs were apparently more scandalous than cleavage).The problem with pictures that try to base everything on a single historical event where there isn't much documentation is that they have to come up with something to 'build up the padding,' so to speak. Like so many before it, 300 fails miserably in this regard, with thin, predictable, and even bizarre minor story threads. 'Troy' (Brad Pitt version) had the same problem.A special effects extravaganza -- a study in set/costume design & cinematic technique straight from Gladiator -- a *lot* of frames filled with wheat -- these are not things to tempt me. The standard 'oh-so-decadent' Persian court was just ridiculous. Pretty much everything about the Persians was ridiculous. You'd think an empire that gobbled up much of the ancient world would have more going for it.Anyway, I'm glad to have watched it so I know what all the fuss was about, but it's not one to see again.",4,0,1,1 July 2008
