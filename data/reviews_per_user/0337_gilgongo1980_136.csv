Alien 3," Bad horror in the dark.
","I have seen the longest version (Special 'Assembly Cut' Edition).
It was terribly bad and boring compared to the other ALIEN movies.

The science fiction was completely missing, the horror scenes were rather weak.

The Equalizer," Overly unrealistic, just like 'John Wick'.
","As I said, the story is too unrealistic for me.
A man against the entire Russian mafia.
And he got away with only two small wounds.
This can only be a fantasy film. The plot was action-packed.

Alien: Resurrection," A little better than the last predecessors, but still weak
","For Aliens (1986) and Alien3 (1992) science fiction has been scarce.

But I didn't like killing of poor birds.
Overall a good movie.",7,1,3,16 January 2020
The Hateful Eight," Disappointing
","The story is weak because there is a lack of substance, it could be formulated in a few sentences. In my opinion, the 'real' plot starts from minute 100.
Before that comes superfluous and boring chatting.
That's not enough for a good movie.
That was a very poor performance by Quentin Tarantino.
But if you cut the movie properly, it could become a good short film.",3,1,3,29 January 2020
Alien," I've seen Prometheus and Alien:Covenant before this movie.
","I know that in 1979 the technology was not as advanced as it is today, so the horror scenes are still OK and the story/plot was OK, too. I hoped for more.

I only saw the film because it won several Oscars.

It was little better than OK, but a second time I'm certainly not going to watch the movie.",6,0,1,5 February 2020
Pitch Black," Weak performance
","A spaceship crashes on a planet. There live hungry aliens. The survivors of the spaceship are partially killed by the aliens. In the end, few survivors can escape from the planet. More does not happen.

Avatar," I understand why this movie was so successful
","The movie includes sci fi, action, adventure, drama, fantasy, war and romance with a happy end and nice music. So it's versatile and appeals to a very large audience. The film is from 2009 and is visually appealing, but the quality of CGI is not as good as, for example, 'The Lord of the Rings' of 2001.
I saw the theatrical version (162 minutes) and I liked the movie, but not very much. The last 40 minutes I could not concentrate anymore, which is why the movie was too long for me.I'm a science fiction fan and the focus here is on fantasy.",6,1,1,8 November 2019

","The movie plays when Godzilla occurs always in the rain and in the dark, so that you could see little. Other films like 'Jurassic World (2015)' have shown that you can make good and decent CGI in daylight. Why does the action take place only in rain and in darkness? Did not the budget suffice?
It is also often shot, but that is a minor matter. Because a gigantic cockroach threatens the city and Godzilla fights against these and for the people.

Cube," A really interesting story.
","This movie shows that you can produce good films even on a low budget.
The plot could have been more exciting. That's why 7/10.",7,0,0,6 December 2019
The Hangover Part III," It didn't hit my taste
","A so-called 'comedy' where I didn't laugh. It just wasn't funny.
A small group of stupid men talk a lot and make nonsense.
It didn't hit my taste.",2,0,0,14 May 2020
Minions," good entertainment for children
","The film was silly, childish and funny, just the right thing for kids.
Adults will probably get bored, like me.",4,0,0,20 May 2020
Gangs of New York," The movie was good, but too long
","The story is interesting, the plot good, the fighting brutal and the actors have played convincingly. But you could have shortened the movie to half the length, almost 3 hours is too much.",7,0,5,24 October 2019
The Cabin in the Woods," Weak performance in the dark
","The story that ritual murders are part of a horror reality show was new and interesting to me.
But in the plot, I had the impression that the film was meant to be a comedy.
But it wasn't funny and even as a horror the film was rather weak and even bad.
I can't give more than 4/10 because the movie didn't entertain me.",4,1,6,25 March 2020
Moon," I am really disappointed
","I like science fiction, but this is superficially a drama (about a cloned man) with a bit of science fiction in the background. This low budget movie was mostly boring but I stuck it through to the end.",3,1,4,28 September 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," mediocre entertainment

The Breakfast Club," nice little teen movie
",Cute little teen movie about the realization that no one is perfect and everyone has problems in puberty.,5,0,0,24 April 2020
Gladiator," The film was mediocre, but too long.
","I saw the Extended Edition.
The story is OK and very similar to 'Braveheart'.
The plot had good fight scenes and was just OK.
But at 171 minutes, the film was too long.
I almost fell asleep several times.
I liked Braveheart a lot better.",5,0,3,23 January 2020
Contact," good performance
","The movie is largely intelligent and emotionally (interpersonal).
To my taste, the sci-fi was not present enough.
As a sci-fi fan I really liked the journey through wormholes.",7,0,1,8 December 2019
Donnie Darko," This is not science fiction, but fantasy
","At the theatrical version you can not understand the story of the movie. Only the Directors Cut provides excerpts from the book 'The Philosophy of Time Travel', which allows you to understand the movie. There is a Chosen One, a parallel universe created by a wormhole when a metallic object passes through. The whole story has absolutely no relation to the physics of our reality, they are fictitious constructs that count towards fantasy.
The music was better than the story. Seriously the soundtrack was outstanding good. I like sci-fi, but that was fantasy.Who wants to see a good sci-fi movie should watch Interstellar (2014) with Matthew McConaughey.",6,1,1,11 November 2019
Born on the Fourth of July," good performance, also by Tom Cruise.
","The story was interesting and is about an important topic in U.S. history.
The plot was a bit boring probably because of the length.",6,1,3,26 April 2020
The Social Network," weak performance
","The story is weak and not worth making a movie about it.
The plot was boring throughout.",3,1,3,28 April 2020
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," good performance
","The story was interesting and the plot exciting.
A classic that offers good entertainment.",9,0,0,13 February 2020
Warm Bodies," Not very good, but also not bad

Overall, the film was OK, so 5/10.",5,0,1,3 May 2020
Beetlejuice," funny fantasy movie
","I laughed a few times, just because of the good performance of Michael Keaton, he saved the movie.",6,1,1,20 May 2020
Alien: Covenant," Successful continuation of Prometheus
","I like good Science Fiction movies and that's also a good horror.
Whereby the focus was on the horror. Prometheus was focused on science fiction.
Apart from Prometheus, Covenant is the best of the ALIEN film series.",7,1,2,30 October 2019
Evil Dead II," The sequel is better than the original (first part)
","The movie is made more complex and better, which is related to the much higher budget. The first part was a bad B-movie for me. But this movie is a good and funny horror.
I liked the idea of time travel through a wormhole.",6,1,1,14 November 2019
Law Abiding Citizen," disappointing ending
","The movie about a badly injured man which was abandoned by the judiciary and who takes revenge on the responsible persons. Apart from the end, I actually liked the movie. But I do not give high ratings for movies with no happy end.",4,0,0,11 October 2019
