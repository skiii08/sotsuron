Frost_Nixon," best film of 2008
","i watched this not really knowing a great deal about the subject matter, however i have to say regardless of how much you know of watergate or nixon, you will enjoy this film. The plot, if you can call it that, dramatisation, is probably more fitting, is so well written, and carried out in outstanding fashion by fantastic acting, in particular Frank Lagella and Kevin Bacon.i would be extremely surprised if both actors do not receive at least one of the big awards for best actor and supporting actor. the production values as ever in a ron howard film are top notch. And the big revelation frost manages to attain from nixon in the final interview leaves you on the edge of your seat with your fist in your mouth, it even leaves you feeling sorry for nixon at the end.
