The Monuments Men," I expected a LOOOT more
","Before I start writing I'd like to advise you not to spend money on this movie. It was a disaster if you ask me. If you really like to know why I think that way, take 2 minutes of your time to read this and you'll know.First I must say that I watched the trailer a few times and even then I knew it wasn't going to be something great, but I was hoping it would turn out to be a decent movie. So I started watching it. But what did I saw?I saw extremely bad introduction and a chaotic scene order. I really didn't know what I was watching. The scenes were short and superficial. I thought I should give it some time so it gets better but no. It just got worse. There were many USELESS scenes, which I don't know why they were put into the movie. I don't even know if there was any introduction at all. The whole movie was made with the same tempo and in the same way. It was bad mixture of comedy adventure and drama.The scenario was below average and the directing was awful. Even though there are actors like Clooney, Damon, Blanchett, Bill Murray etc, I wasn't impressed by the acting at all. I must say that the whole point of the movie was a mistake. It was very unrealistic because most of the scenes were rubbish. I mean who would leave 1000 tons of gold and 16 thousand artistic pieces unguarded in an abandoned mine? How is it possible that there is no one on the streets of Bruge the night before the German withdrawal of the town? And there were many more scenes like this..The story was very chaotic. The scenes were not connected one to each other at all. And what angered me the most was the end of the movie, when the anti Russian propaganda was shown. I mean it was one of the worst movies I've seen in a year or more..",3,48,85,13 February 2014
American Hustle," The actors made the film.
","I'll be honest with you and say that I expected more from this movie. It was a classic crime drama that I have seen before. The scenario was good but it wasn't special. What made this movie good was the acting. I am big fan of Christian Bale and I am very happy with how he dealt with this role. He was perfect in it. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence were both great too. I was a little bit disappointed with Bradley Cooper because he didn't quite fit into the role he played, but that is from my point of view.Anyway the film is good. But I expected more of it. 7 is the most it can get.",7,0,3,12 February 2014
