Requiem for a Dream," this is what awesome film-making and acting looks like.
","thoughtful in every possible manner, no punches are pulled. when the camera is dutch, it means something. when you see the actor's key light on the wrong side, it's for a reason. this a rare film with the BALLS to actually execute it's intention to the fullest. it just gets better with each viewing. i certainly recommend the directors cut DVD to those who unfortunately missed in on the big screen. cheers...",10,0,1,1 March 2002
