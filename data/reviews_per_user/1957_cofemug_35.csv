The Blair Witch Project," Great movie, not for the weak-stomached
","I really liked this movie even though it made me sick to my stomach.  No, it is not from the gore.  It was from the camera work.  Do not see this movie is you are easily susceptible to motion sickness.  I don't know if Dramamine will work but it sure could not hurt.  The camera work makes you think that you are walking and running with the people, but you are standing still, so you get sick.  Trust me, this actually happens.I have heard, however, that if you rent it the effect will not happen. However, the movie itself was great.  It was kind of creepy and it had an overall real effect, plus the ending just kicks.Plot:  Three kids making a documentery dissappear, and then their footage is found.  Basically you watch their documentary.  The movie is, although I have heard that it resembles The Last Broadcast, which I have not seen, is unlike any other movie I have ever seen.  It feels like a documentary.  If you become creeped out, just think that it is only a movie. 
Acting:  Resembled the actual downfall of human thinking.  It was superb and realistic.  You actually feel that the people are reacting to what is around them.  You will know these people and what makes them tick by the end of the movie.  It will feel like they are your friends.  In fact, their personalities are quite common.This movie was a genuinely creepy movie, and I highly recommend it to everyone, with Dramamine.  Or just wait for video.  But, if you can get past it, see it with everyone else at the theater.  You will be shocked with everyone else.  Although not a jumpy movie, it will freak you out of your mind.---------9",9,0,0,8 August 1999
Scarface," Definately a cult movie
","First of all, Brian DePalma cannot direct that well.  He major successes have been Carrie and the Untouchables.  Carrie was a classic because it was penned by Steven King, and everybody could relate to it.  Many I know (not me) hate the high school scene.  He also did Mission: impossible.  Yuck. Now, this movie which is decent.This movie should have been in the hands of a more competent director. DePalma directs this like it was a mediocre movie.  It had alot of potential, but it just did not match up.  It was pointlessly fancy, and extremely long.  However, it did work in 1 really intriguing hour into its works.  That would be the middle hour, or Tony's rise, and just over the crest.  The montage which just about finished the good part of the movie was the longest montage with some of the longest scenes that I have ever seen. It was very excessive.  In many ways, the excess helped the movie, and in many ways it killed it.  It helped in the violence department.  It destroyed in the length department.  The running time of over 2.5 hours for an overly simple story evaporates interest in the story.  By the end, I wanted the movie to end so badly.  Was I supposed to feel sorry for Tony?  or not? 
Either way, it was entertaining, and people should see it to see the memorable violent scenes and quotes.  'Say hello to my little friend'  Other than that this was a throw away movie exploring themes better than that.Part of the problem, and I think that the movie would have been much more entertaining if it was fixed, was the music.  In fact that was the worst music in a mainstream movie I have ever heard.  I was just waiting for Buckaroo Banzai to jump into the movie and save everybody.  It never happened, and the movie died. 5/10",5,4,8,1 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Rehashed drivel that has very good parts.
","First, let me say that I have at least taken a few days to mull this movie over and make my opinions clear to myself.  I am not a deep thinker, and so do not have that many deep thoughts about this movie.  'Natural Born Killers,' 'Star Wars, 4' and anything by Kubrick cause me to have naturally deep thoughts.  I liked the fourth episode, simply because of the story. I am 17, and therefore, am jaded to technologies.  I thought that this movie had the technologies, but lacked anything else.I was bored by this movie.  It seemed longer than 'Titanic.'  I thought that the whole movie would end with the pod race.  The effects were the best thing about this movie, and in my opinion, Lucas indulged himself with them. He is much like Joel Schumacher making 'Batman and Robin.'  They are both fasciated with what they can do with technologies, sets, and effects. Lucas puts everything into the effects and forgets that he is making atwo hour movie until at least 90 minutes into it.I enjoyed the pod race, simply because I thought that the snipers were hilarious.  Uh Oh another problem.  The war at the end was visually breathtaking, but essentially mind-numbing.  The droids were boring, and they did not kill off the one character that really needed it, Jar Jar.  I think that if they killed him off, the kids would have cried, but every ingle guy over the age of 13 would have stood up and cheered.  That scene would have gotten a standing ovation.  The fight scene was very cool.The Phantom Menace seems to refer to Ani, much like Luke was A new hope. So, the story remains the same.  The only defense is that all wars are essentially the same, and so history is repeating itself.  Or, if you want to get technical, repeated itself already.  In the next one, I think Ani will find out his father really is Darth sidious, and Obi-Wan will be frozen.  He will also find out that the Queen is really his sister.  In other words, this movie is exactly the same as the old one, except that a Darth dies in this one.  The story, therefore, moved really slowly until it stood still.  This movie lacked any real soul, or imagination.  The fourth episode was all heart and you actually rooted for the good guy.  It was a tale that we all could relate to. We did not nor were not able to relate to this story until Anakin left his mother, and that was about the only point that we could.  It was cold, and sterile.So, in other words, see this movie in the biggest screen that the theater has, and maked sure that it is THXed because the only good part is the sound and big effects.  I do not think it would look the same on a small screen. I would really hate the movie then.  I think Lucas should have tried a little harder with this one.  Don't forget to throw popcorn at Jar Jar, its what the theaters want.---6",6,0,1,26 May 1999
Alien: Resurrection," actually...liked it
","It seems that many people have been ignoring the reason that I think this movie is so good.  It is FUNNY.  This is an all-out campy throw-back to the days when a horror movie had no substance, and KNEW IT.  There were gallons and gallons of icky, gooey, gross-out slime and sludge.  The sets were the only serious things about this movie.  I could not help but enjoy myself. For example, as revenge for getting frozen at with a button, the alien puts a guy into the room and pushes the button.  They are almost like the 'intelligent' dinosaurs of Jurassic Park.  I laughed in that movie too. And, in the underwater scene, I timed it, they were moving extremely fast for almost three minutes of movie time.  However, this was cut and edited for time reasons, and if it was featured in real-time, it probably would have been 5-7 minutes, while blood pumping and racing, working hard.  Not done in real world.  The images of Ripley's predecessors of clones were funny (teeth on the side of the mouth), and the comment afterwards gave you the signal to be offended and laugh (What a waste of ammo.  Must be a chick thing.)Now for the comparison: I love the Alien series.  However, I am probably the only one who feels that they could almost be independent of each other. They are all on the same level.  Alien was more of the true horror film that it was.  Aliens was more sci-fi and action, Terminator-like, also Cameron. I loved Alien 3, if you do not realize that it is an Alien movie.  It is a great moody suspense movie.  It is the darkest, moodiest movie ever.  It has more drama than all of the others combined.  Alien R. is the campiest movie off the series, because the other genres are worn out.  It is funny and good.  All are different, and should be regarded as completely independent.Since I love this movie for being bad------------6",Null,0,0,9 May 1999
The 13th Warrior," The number of warriors should have remained at twelve.
","This movie totally sucked.  I mean it was one of the worst this year.  If I wasn't with four other people, I would have left long before the movie was over.  The only redeeming quality to the movie was the graphic depictions of beheadings, and other such violence.  I almost fell asleep.  This is coming from a person who tries to find something to like in every movie, especially aggressive movies.  (Check my list all the good movies are aggressive toward something from social values to just plain tension, plus they are semi-unique.)Plot:  The reluctant dragon strikes again.  Bandaras falls in love with a shiek's mistress and then is banished.  He finds the Huns(?) and must fight with them because the 13th warrior cannot be one of them.  How stupid is that.  The beginning is very circumstantial.  How convenient that he arrives the night before the messenger for help does.  How convenient that the 13th must not be one of them.  Then they fight eaters of the dead.  They look like bears, but they ride horses, and are really people. 
Violence:  Awesome.  The best part of the whole movie.  It has several graphic beheadings.  I would like to make a montage of the fighting scenes, and skip the rest of the movie.  Blood spurts from necks and heads are carried off.  I sat on the edge of my seat for those parts.  My mind slept for the rest of the movie.  Script:  Awful.  I have seen better dialogue written on bathroom stalls. The best lines are in the previews, and they are not even that good.  I could not believe that audacity of the film-makers to make this bad of a movie.  Plus, who would be able to pick up a whole new language without a dictionary or knowing one single word.  It is quite impossible.Acting:  As bad as the script.  I guess I should not have gone to this movie considering that Antonio has not made a good movie yet!!  Desperado was overdone, Assassins was overlong.  Everybody else was bad too.This movie was not even entertaining.  Beware, do not go see this.  You will suffer.  Anything with this many coincidences cannot be good.  Go see the Sixth Sense.  Rent a classic.  Hell, go see an Adam Sandler movie, but do not see this movie...Unless very small amounts of completely graphic violence can hold our attention.  3/10",3,0,4,1 September 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Great movie, not for everyone. esp. kids
","I saw this movie and laughed and laughed and laughed.  I was shocked and offended.  It was one of the bravest movies of the year, nevertheless decade, or history.  It was definitely bigger and longer.  It certainly seemed uncut, even though it wasn't.  See June 29 studio brief.  It was hilarious.Plot: The movie had a great plot.  I won't give it all away, but it is definitely big.  It starts with Stan, Cartman, Kyle, Kenny, and Kyle's little brother sneaking into the Terrance Phillip movie, 'A**es of Fire,' which has been rated R.  They learn all kinds of swear words and use them at all times.  The rest of South Park kids see it also, and by the next school day, the parents find out and totally hate the movie.  They form a group against the movie.  It goes out from there.  There is also a plot with Kenny going to hell, and finding Saddam Hussein and Satan in love.  Saddam is a hornball.  And Satan regrets the whole relationship.Crudity:  Definitely for adults only.  It probably has the most swear words than any other movie this year.  It has cartoon nudity.  It has breasts and wriggling penises.  All cartoon, of course.  It has violence galore by the end.  Do not take your kids to see this, or be prepared to feel uncomfortable.  All theaters must enforce the carding laws for this one. However, if none of this will offend you to the point of hatred, do not see this.  It also has racism, sexism, and offends every group out there from the Gays to the MPAA to the parents.As a whole:  The funniest movie so far of 1999.  I laughed so hard.  I found it only mildly offensive personally, but then I also love the movie 'Pink Flamingos.'  I cannot recommend this movie to everyone.  I can recommend it to those who are not offended easily.  This does not include the people who feel brave because they survived 'There's Something About Mary.'  Parents will not like this movie unless they are completely open-minded, and I recommend not seeing it with your children.  However, it is wonderful.  I loved the musical format that they chose.  Everywhere there is a song. Also stay past the credits, there is an after-scene.  It is trying to be a 'Pink Flamingos.' I love it but can only recommend it to the group from 17-30, male.----------------------------10",10,56,77,30 June 1999
Blade," Oh boy.
","This was a movie that I laughed at.  I know that it wasn't meant to be a total comedy but I couldn't help it.  This was a movie where I was scared I was going to get kicked out of.  I ended up watching this like it was a movie for Mystery Science Theater 3000.I was expecting a lot from this film.  I was expecting a dark, brooding film with many great action sequences.  At least I got one of those expectations fulfilled.  I loved the action sequences.  There were a few, but not as many as I had hoped.  Either that or there were too few for the length of the film. The special effects was the stuff that made the movie...funny.  I laughed at the computerized gore and the thing that looked like Jabba the Hutt.  It was so funny.  And the gore looked like it came from a video game that wasn't meant to be explicit.Also some of the things that they came up with and stole the other things made me die laughing.  The scene stolen from Ray-Ban sunglasses, and the sunblock commercial were hilarious. The best scene was the rave scene.  It had a freak-out feeling to it, and I thought it was magnificent.  The strobes and the raining blood were cool. The soundtrack kicked butt and I would buy it in a heartbeat, if I had the money.Finally go see it, but don't expect anything more than a kid's movie with a R rating.",Null,0,2,29 August 1998
The Mummy," Decent waste of 2.5 hours
","I have to recommend this movie because I enjoyed myself, even though this movie has nothing of any value to it.  It seems like a send-up of an Indiana Jones movie, and, although the only Indy movie I liked was 'Temple of Doom,' which this movie is more like than the others, I liked this one.  It has creepy crawlys, weird, strange fx, nonsense, implausibility, and everything else.  I found myself enjoying it, even though it did not click with me. I like adventure movies with gadgets, 007 has Q, Inspector Gadget, etc. But, I must recommend this movie, and see it on the big screen, the FX are worth it, and would look dinky on anything but.---------7",7,0,0,13 May 1999
Catch-22," As a movie, it works, as an adaptation, it doesn't
","OK, a friend told me not to compare the book with the movie.  So, I will only say that the book was the hardest book in the world to adapt, and this was an ambitious film for trying it.  The movie works.  It also doesn't work.  (Catch-22)  The reason that the movie itself doesn't work is that it works all too well.  It gathered the style of being a catch-22, and made itself stressful, muddled, and confused.  Stream of conciousness does not really work in a movie.  But on a second viewing, you begin to realize that this is the purpose of the movie.  So, it in essence doesn't work because it works all too well.  The movie is funny, but by the time you laugh a new scene has started.  The scenes last about one min. each, because Henry tried to cram as much from the book into the movie.  But he left out individual favorite scenes that have nothing to do with the movie.  Maybe this would work if it became the length of a miniseries, and included every aspect of the book, but that would be a monstrosity and too big.  The book is impossible to transform to a movie.  I hope Hollywood reads this, and maybe give it a secod chance, but for now we are left with a movie that you don't know what to say about it.     ?/10",Null,2,10,31 May 2000
Crash," ...And Burn
","I wrote this as a two part review. Part two has spoilers.Part 1: No, this isn't that one about the sex with car accidents. This is the one about racism in L.A. You know, the one where everybody is a racist, and race is the topic on everybody's mind at all times. Race.Its like the movie has a form of turrets syndrome where race is the constant theme. Race. Racist. Racism. Race Relations. Relay race.Paul Haggis made a movie which took the structure of Magnolia, which was used to show the disconnect of people who are tangentially connected, and then screwed it into a 1'53' mental vomit about racism in America. RACE. In the 24 hour period we have 7 stories running parallel all connected and about race. The first hour, people say ridiculous stuff and do absurd things in an effort to be real about racism in America.For example, the story with Ludicrous and Larenz Tate provides the comic relief. Too bad, the first half of their story is lifted straight from The Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction. RACISM. Their section is the Quentin Tarantino section where, instead of being cool and talking about foot massages and religion, the characters talk about race and racism. CONSTANTLY. The other good thing about it is the Mexican story when the Mexican guy is talking to his daughter. He gives her his invisible impenetrable cloak to protect her from bullets. Decent writing, but that's only because the writers have had daughters and know what they would say in his place.The rest of the stories are extremely ludicrous. The Hindi does not act in any semblance of realism. The scene where he's trying to get the lock fixed and the Mexican tells him he needs a new door is abbreviated and stupid. Why would anybody act like that? Is it realistic? NOOO. It reminds me more of the convenience store clerk from The Doom Generation. 'Six Dollar Sixty Six Cents girly.' If i ever watch the second half of the movie, I hope his head is shot off and his bodiless head starts coughing up relish.I haven't mentioned race in over a paragraph. RACE. RACISM. RACE FOR THE SUN. Better. Then, there is the black guy who wants to be white, Matt Dillon who has a chip on his shoulder against blacks, Ryan Phillippe who looks beautiful and does nothing, and various other bad actors acting badly with bad dialog. When Matt Dillon molests the black producers wife, could I help it if I was cracking up? When Philippe is second guessing his writing up of his partner for racism, can I help but crack up? The movie is so funny when it is being racist. Racist. RACIST I tell you.Now, mind you, this movie was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Editing, besides a nod to Matt Dillon who actually did attempt to do a decent job. Who was paid off for that one, I have no clue.Don't see it unless you feel like being preached at about the racism in society through a bad and unrealistic script from 2 white men over fifty who have no semblance of reality or interaction with real society in any way shape or form.D- Part 2:The second half of Crash takes any and all story lines in the first half...and spews them back out in a sort of redemptive, conclusionary, the world is a big coincidence kind of way. And it is in fact one of the worst ways to do it.Take 1999's Magnolia. People weren't conveniently tied together over and over again. They were just connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. You know somebody who knows somebody who did something that you knew somebody else was also involved in. Crash takes this wrapping into a serious extreme.The stories are lined up so everybody meets again. Are there only 5 on the LAPD force? Aren't these people working weird shifts? Dillon and Philippe were a late shift then an early one the next day? And, why did Tate have to be the murdered hitchhiker? Wouldn't it have had more emotional tension, as well as realism, if it had been somebody we had not been following all day long? Like Phillippe just picks up a random hitchhiker and then freaks out. Everybody'd be freaking out.Eventually, in the second half, the touching invisible cloak scene is used to get the Hindi to shoot the daughter. It ticked me off and made me feel dirty. Not that the Hindi shot the daughter, but that they created a beautiful touching scene and then had it be the direct cause of people tearing up. It really ticked me off. At the writers, not the scene.The whole movie is fake and totally uncalled for. The coincidences are far too many and they require an extreme suspension of disbelief. Unlike Magnolia which was connected mildly, this had connections upon connections upon connections which were just so over-the-top. The only good part in the second half was when Sandra Bullock falls down the stairs. She doesn't die though. She should have. I cheered when she fell.The worst part about the movie is it pulls a Magnolia. Not just in structure, but it has a montage over the song In the Deep where you see everybody being depressed. Magnolia took this and had post-modern commentary on it by having all of the characters singing along to Aimee Mann's Wise Up. Unfortunately, Magnolia came out in 1999, while Crash came out in 2005. Its hard to make commentary on a movie which won't be made for another 6 years, but it happened. Somehow.Utter waste of my time.First half: D-; Second half: lowest grade ever; Overall: F---",1,167,278,27 February 2006
MASH," Moderately Funny
","I am a person who grew up, and grew sick of, the CBS tv-hit series.  It was always on in my house, even in reruns.  This movies seems to be like a series of racier tv episodes.  It kind of does not flow like normal Altman movies (if you can call them normal).  This seems like a string of jokes strung together by the same characters with nothing in between to glue the characters together.  Every other Altman movie has a minor connection between decently sized stories, or at least one good story.  So, much of the humor was lost in that.  Plus, I also read, and saw the lesser movie of, Catch-22.  This movie, although based on a different book, seems like it was trying to capture the essence of Catch-22 by making it chaotic and dark.  At times it works, and at times it doesn't.  Don't get me wrong, these are just reasons I did not think that this is a great movie.  However, I did like it.  The jokes in it were pretty funny, and the theme song had me laughing for a while.  I wish that they used lyrics to the theme song for the TV shows' credits.  The suicide scene was funny, as well as the trip to Japan.  But, it just did not seem to have any flow or reason for disjunction.  At least in Catch-22, the reason for jerkiness was to make it seem like a look back that all blurs together. This seems like you are there but pass out for lengths of a time.  But, it made me laugh for awhile, but it had its slow parts.  I really liked how it ended.  7/10P.S.  Contrary to a below comment, it does swear in the movie.  How it passed for a PG rating, I'll never know.  But this was the earliest instance I have seen of a non-R rated movie with the 'f'-word in it.  Check the football game, right between music.  A player says to watch your head, or i'll rip it off, or something like that with an f word in there.  So Ha!",7,6,13,26 February 2000
"Monsters, Inc."," cool beans
","Hey, I know I'm the type who loves those evil rated 'R' movies that ask for NC-17s, but I love this movie too.  In fact, I love Pixar.  They haven't made a bad movie yet (although I didn't care as much for 'A Bug's Life'), and this movie is no exception.  This movie has a sophisticated sense of humor, and is just as satirical as it is endearing.  Sure, you know the plot of the movie and the final result around 10 minutes (I'm guessing, i didn't look at my watch at all during the movie), but who cares?  The movie is full of humor and great graphics.  Unlike 'Shrek,' which I noticed somebody liked better, this movie wears its heart on its sleeve.  'Shrek' tried to make itself out to be an attack on Disney (and it was good for the first 20 minutes), but then it turns into an overly-sappy movie worthy of Disney. This movie never pretends to be bitter and mean, but is a bit tongue-in-cheek.  *Possible Spoilers* This is a movie which makes monsters in the closet friendly.  They collect screams to power their city.  But, the kids don't scare as easily, and there is a power shortage.  By way of an evil plan, a closet gateway (read Door) is left around for Sully to find, and the kid terrorizes the monsters.  The evil plan is to kidnap the kids and steal their screams to power the city. Sully and his partner Mike try to put the girl back, and eventually succeed, but not before being exiled, returning, and such. *End spoilers*Well, this movie fully understands subtle humor, and the college crowd (that's all that was there pretty much when I saw it) loved the movie.  Even the gay joke is innocent, and subtle.  The monsters are cuddly and friendly, and everything in this movie seems to work for the best.  It gets a little sappy in a few spots, but it never pretended to be anything but happy, not to mention the kids probably love it.  So, check out this movie...especially if you loved 'Toy Story.'

10 Things I Hate About You," The best teenage movie of recent times (late '90s)
","I LOVED this movie.  This is everything a teenage movie should be and more. It takes 'The Taming of the Shrew,' and modernizes it, and also places it in a situation that is more suitable to kids.  'Cruel Intentions' stunk because it was kids being like adults.  This movie avoided the total stereotypes, and showed that everyone has reasons for being the way they are.  It also shows that most people have more than one side to them and that most people are not all smart or all dumb.The acting was some of the greatest acting for teen movie in years.  They were so believable, and the characters were not over done.  I'll admit, Cameron and his sidekick were a little cheesy, but isn't teen life?  My favorite characters, Kat and Petruchio (now, Patrick) both remained as mean as ever.  I walked out of this movie with a smile on my face from acting alone.The plot was different but the same from 'The Taming of the Shrew.'  They had to change the plot because what happened in 'The Taming of the Shrew' would not fly in modern times, especially in only dating situations.  I was happy with the changes.  At least they came up with plausible reasons for the occurrences, and the reason for why the taming worked.  They did not over-exaggerate anything in the movie.  Everything was played as it should have been.  I laughed my butt off.Run don't walk to this movie, and see it often.  That is how much I liked this movie.  It is great for teenagers, and I think that everybody, including adults, should see this movie.  It is not bubble-gum, you're-a-moronic-teenager, let's-see how dumb-you-are movie, this is a great movie.  I highly recommend it.  However, those of you who do not like drastic changes to the classics, stick with the Elisabeth Taylor, Richard Burton version of 'The Taming of the Shrew.'  For the teenagers out there, I hope this inspires you to read the play.  Read as much Shakespeare as you can, he rocks.  Take it from me, I have read six of his plays this year already.---------10",10,1,2,2 April 1999
Pitch Black," One of the worst EVER
","I saw this movie thinking it was going to be either really bad or really good.  Both would have been entertaining.  But it is just plain bad, and boring.  I saw this movie at the 8:00 showing, and fell asleep.  The first half was sooooo boring.  I caught just enough of it to catch the plot.  Then stayed awake for the second half, which made me want to leave the theater. 
The special effects were decent, but nothing really spectacular.  I could probably do that with several million dollars and a computer.  The coolest parts of the film was when you see through Diesel's eyes, and the monsters' eyes.  Although I have done the special effect of the monsters' vision with Paint Shop Pro, I have not seen it on the movie screen.  In fact, it looked like they just used PSP to get all of their visual effects. 
The rest of the movie was shoddy.  The one-liners were not that great (sometimes movies have some real winners, which this movie did not have), the plot sucked, the sub-plots were pretentious, and the story has been done.  It could have been such a cool movie if it had better directing, writing, editing, cinematography, visuals, etc.  In fact, I would not wish this movie on my worst enemy (although I could stomach forcing them to watch Deep Impact or Kazaam or Leonard Part 6 until they died) simply because it was so painful.  I kept hoping for a good ending, but it never came. 
Also, why were the day time visuals so washed out?  Was it just to create a contrast to the dark?  It was so pointless.  At least in Three Kings, the visuals were meant to look like a Xerox copy because of the news prints, and such.  This did not have a reason to look like that except it was a bad Xerox copy of other better movies.  Vin Diesal had potential in his role, but it was never reached.  Also, I should have drank some of the alcohol that they burned for fuel to get through this movie.  Snore!----------------------------1/10",1,6,13,28 February 2000
Little Miss Sunshine," Contrived but fun
","I went to this sneak preview really wanting to like the movie. I really like Alan Arkin, Toni Collette, and Steve Carell. The plot was deliciously dark: a dysfunctional family goes on a road trip so the young daughter can participate in a beauty pageant. But, the problem is that the movie screamed 'I'm an indie flick.' From the poster to the commercials, I should have been warned that it would fall into the traps that these independent films generally do. But, I had high hopes.Nevertheless they were somewhat dashed. Little Miss Sunshine is indeed a darkish comedy of sorts, but only of the most contrived sort. The family in Little Miss Sunshine neither feels like a family nor acts like they are connected by having lived together for years. The family includes:<ul><li>Olive, the young daughter who asks all the good questions that need to be asked for the movie to develop its plot. </li></ul><ul><li>Richard, the over-talkative father who spouts self-help while calling everybody losers. He is depending on a book deal that may not come through.</li></ul><ul><li>Sheryl, the working mother who is impatient with the whole situation.</li></ul><ul><li>Dwayne, the Nitzche-reading son who has taken a vow of silence until he can get into the air force to fly jets.</li></ul><ul><li>Grandpa, the perverted old man who snorts heroin and is also Olive's coach.</li></ul><ul><li>Frank, Sheryl's homosexual brother, fresh off an attempted suicide after a failed relationship with his grad student.</li></ul>At the beginning of the movie, Olive is given the Sunnydale regional Little Miss Sunshine title due to her placing second and first place was forced to drop out. The last-minute nature of the phone call sends the family into a flurry of action leading to the decision that everybody will be in the VW van for the road trip. The road trip consists of many odd and stupid contrivances in order to set up for repeated jokes and motifs. The van's clutch drops out, which causes everybody to push it in order to drive it. Phone signals drop out at inconvenient times, and chance situations all pile on top of each other. Add to these contrivances the fact that none of the family reacts like people who have known each other for years. They act and react like characters in a cheap play. The only one who moderately pulls it off is Toni Collette. Thankfully, Toni has the timing and grace of a truly caring mother trying to hold the family together. However, the comic aspects of the rest of the performers are all spot on. The movie isn't all bad. When it is funny, it is frequently hilarious. Especially when it is believable. When the situations aren't so constructed to seem like they were written solely for laughs, Little Miss Sunshine really shines. When it isn't believable it is tiresome and stretched. Paul Dano also shines in the first half-hour of the movie when he acts like a child who is tired of the family. But, by the end, he just isn't trying nearly as hard as he was. Steve Carell and Greg Kinnear also flex their comic timing muscle in the movie as they can. They make their jokes work even when they aren't working. For the dark humor that the movie gets right, it is an enjoyable movie. It isn't bad, it just isn't great. It just doesn't click.B-",6,4,20,27 July 2006
U-571," Bring your brains, and a sense of humor.
","What?  Did you say that this wasn't supposed to be a comedy?  Oh, I am sorry, I guess that I laughed so much that I thought it was a satire of the genre without having much of the outrageousness of satires.  As you can tell, I think that this is a horrid, horrid movie. I laughed and laughed at the overall bad quality of the movie.  It was so cliched, that if you saw the preview, and have any knowledge of the genre whatsoever, you can predict every event that will happen in the movie within five minutes after the title.Plot-Cliche after cliche.  SPOilERS SPOILERS WARNING WARNING SPOILERS SPOILERS WARNING WARNING  Ok, the plot of this movie is a German U-boat has been broken by a couple of American depth charges.  The Americans find out it is in distress.  Meanwhile, McCrappahay finds out that he will not get to command a ship due to the general's lack of recommendation.  If you can't figure out the rest you are in bad shape.  He is on board for the U-boat take-over, and the American boat is torpedoed with the general on-board. Matt takes over, and the U-boat is fixed.  Then, a German destroyer finds them and a battle ensues.  As per usual, the americans win and matt gains respect.  if you haven't seen this style of movie before, send me a message. I mean it's McHales Navy meets any war movie.  minus the intentional humor. Don't forget the all-important self-sacrificeDialogue-the worst.  Matt gives such trite, scripted words of encouragement that run along the lines of 'You can do it.  Reach for that star.'  This inspires SPOILER self-sacrifice END SPOILER Keital says 'I'll set sail with you any day of the week.'  I hung my head in shame.  'Nuff said.Direction-Worse than the direction in Breakdown.  At least breakdown was moderately tense and interesting.  They had unnecessary close-ups, bad angles (and I thought that Redneck Zombies had better direction and angles), and just overall suckiness.Special effects-Good.  About the best thing of the movie, although I couldn't help but think of Titanic when the American ship sinks (in commercials).  The explosions were nice.  SPOILER why do the Germans bomb so much smarter than the Americans with depth charges?  is a torpedo really powerful enough to disintegrate a whole ship?  wouldn't it take at least two?  why does the dead body get torpedoes out of a FAULTY TUBE?  Just curious.Music-THE WORST music ever made for a movie.  I laughed so hard at what it was trying and failing miserably at accomplishing.  It was so completely awful that we all cringed at the music.So, if you are in the mood for a good comedy, go see U-571.  Or, if you can get past all of the essential plot conventions, bad dialogue, retarded music, boring movie, and awful people commenting behind you about how bad this movie is (i.e. me) then see this movie when there is nobody in the theater.  Otherwise skip this piece of trash that is worse than Redneck Zombies.-----------------------------------------2",2,0,1,14 April 2000
American Beauty," Beautiful film
","This movie is the second movie of the year to bring tears to my eyes, the first being 'The Iron Giant.'  This is a very difficult and emotional movie that I highly recommend to everybody.  The movie is more about the characters and their eccentricities than anything else.  Kevin Spacey does make the movie, though.  It is very real, funny, sad, and tangible.Acting- Top of the line.  You actually believe that Kevin Spacey is pulling himself out of the rut, and going through his mid-life crisis.  You believe that a woman like Annette Bening can be so vapid and empty, while finding her happiness.  Everybody acts the way that they are supposed to.  But, the shining star was Wes Bentley as the next-door neighbor.  Although I think that the video helps him to remember as well as to hide from the real world. Everything looks distant through a camera.  On the other side, everything is vulnerable and exposed.  Thus creating real feelings and thoughts come out.  Story-Interesting take on people's search for happiness.  The other really good one solely on the subject that I have seen is 'Happiness,' which is much much darker, and more depressing.  This movie ends up to be a beautiful movie with a beautiful ending.  No, i am not sick for thinking that, but it was fitting and realistic. The neighbor also went through his own change and transformation, which means that the movie is all inclusive in shells, and the search for happiness.All in all, i think that this is what Hollywood does best.  This is a great movie, that is only feel good once you intrepret it.  Hollywood should learn how to make movies that let you feel what you want.  People can be saddened by the movie if they want, i was cheered.  Plus, the movie was just so well done that everybody should see it.  However, do not expect anything or learn the plot.  I didn't know what it was, and loved it.-----10",10,0,0,22 September 1999
Apocalypse Now," The best war movie ever, turned mediocre
","I am so happy that this movie was re-released into theaters.  It was a joy with the sounds and the widescreen and the height and just the enormousness that the movie deserves.  However, it does not deserve the enormous running time that the redux version has.  If the majority of the added scenes weren't self-explanatory, then i wouldn't have a problem.  But, there was a reason the Plantation scene was cut (obvious and boring), there was a reason the second Playboy bunny scene was cut (it still isn't fashionable to take on women's lib, but especially in a war movie).  There is a reason why the originally works oh so much better than Redux.  As for the original, it is amazing watching the plot unfold, the characters develop, the separatism, everything man.  It was like wow.  I can't explain it, simply because it is so mysterious and aggressive that it can't' be explained.  This is a serious head trip of a war movie, with nothing really making sense, and all having a point to attack the government, the military, or society's take on war.  Watch this surreal movie for the trip it is, and you will love it.  I remember turning it on at 1:00 am, and finishing it without even noticing its 2.5 hour length.10/10 (original) 5 /10 (Redux)",Null,0,0,20 November 2001
Being John Malkovich," The best movie of 1999
","Hands down, I loved this movie better than any one that I have seen this year.  I saw it before it came out for the first time.  I went in like everybody else, not knowing what it was about.  I laughed until I cried from being so offronted with audacity.  It was funnier than anything I saw, including South Park, Election, and Go.  It was a brave new movie that challenged how all movies were made, in general.All of the actors and actresses in this movie seemed to know what Jonze was going for.  They all acted psychotic and unbelievable in a movie that was psychotic and unbelievable.  There is absolutely no realism to this movie, nor does it ever attempt to be a realistic movie.  From the surreal intro to the creepy ending, this movie never strayed from way out of left field.  It stayed its course, and everybody who hates this be damned.I really would love to spill the beans about everything in this movie, it is so wonderful...but I can't.  I can't even give away any basic plot points. I went in blind and appreciated it all the more for going in blind that I do it now with all of my movies.  I will go in blind, except knowing about performances or genres.  I almost started this paragraph spilling plot points that are basic, but I deleted them.  Go in and be surprised.However, I cannot recommend this movie to everybody.  This is a brash movie that will shock and offend some in ways that they have not imagined.  It is a black comedy, darker than most.  However, there is no death in this movie. It takes its humor from better, more intellectual sources than that.  But, it is dark, and most will hate the movie for being brash, and not having many likeable characters.  However, the rest will love this movie for being brave, brash, and unlike anything we've ever experienced before.----------------10",10,0,0,19 January 2000
Dark City," Required viewing for lovers of 'Metropolis' and 'Blade Runner'
","This is what I call a great movie.  I loved this movie when it first came out, in 1998, and I saw it again and I still love it.  This movie is visually stunning like no other movie.  The special effects were even somewhat ripped off for 'The Matrix,' which is one of the very few similarities that I can think of.  This movie is not about alternate realities like 'The Matrix' or 'Thirteenth Floor.'  This movie is about studies and science.  This is a science fiction movie WITH the science still in it.  It is a slow, thoughtful movie that will make you think about your life as a whole.  Plot:  Can't reveal the plot otherwise I will spoil everything.  However, I will also suggest that you mute the beginning voice-over because it gives way too much away.  It gives you a basis for the rest of the movie.  If you forget about the voice-over, you will be as confused as the man in the bathtub.Presentation:  The whole movie has an eerie, classic sense.  It feels more like a film noir than 'LA Confidential.'  You have the sense of the detective and almost can read what he would say in a voice over.  But you can only guess, which is part of the fun.  The sets are fabulous and dark. They seem to fit all into place.  The camera angles just look strange and twisted, which adds to the effect of the movie.  I recommend watching the DVD version with Roger Ebert's commentary, and you will notice a lot more in the movie.  Such as the quick cuts of static shots to start to confuse you, and later the camera moves more and more.  Great choice of film work.
This movie is a great movie for those who think and analyze.  If you don't like movies with intelligence, or don't like to be confused or don't like movies that have almost no brightness in them, skip this movie.  This movie is dark, and almost dreary.  It is a great movie that makes you watch and think about it.  I highly recommend this movie to all others.-------------9",9,0,1,9 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Change after 30 minutes.
","I highly recommend seeing this movie at the theatres...then seeing another movie after the first thirty minutes is over.  The first thirty minutes was all of the balls that this movie had.  After the grisly scene, Spielberg castrates this movie.  The movie was too long for its own good.First, the 20-second intro and finale.  These were the most emotional scenes of the whole movie.  They brought tears to my eyes, seeing all of the soldiers that died in the wars for this country.  That is what the crosses were, and it was in a national cemetary, probably Arlington.  These were two of the three most sad moments of the movie.Second: the thirty-minute D-day battle.  This was the other emotional moment of the movie.  This is the only time that I disagree in that I thought that the movie was very realistic.  I was depressed by it, and saddened.  Especially when one soldier picks up his arm.  The use of sound, visuals, and effects were outstanding for this portion of the movie.  It depressed me.Third: the rest of the movie.  It SUCKED.  I was bored to tears, that is why it is depressing.  I sat there, and sat there, and sat there waiting for something intellectual to come up and at least slap me.  No, I do not think that the dilemma of trying to rescue one soldier is intellectual, I think it is STUPID.  It did not show any realities, and I did not want to go along, and it just was pure crap.  This is very superficial, and I felt that I should have probably cared about the people, but I DID NOT.    This ruined the end of the movie because I was so bored, that I did not notice the violence all that much in the last scene, and was only a little moved by the crosses reappearing.I give this movie a four because it did not try.  It is just as fluffy as 'Shakespeare In Love,' which also did not deserve to win.  I must highly recommend 'The Thin Red Line' because it makes you think for yourselves, instead of trying to force you to think 'THERE.  THIS IS BAD.  CRY.  BE HAPPY.  FEEL THIS.'  My response to these movies is 'I'm not stupid, don't insult me.  Let me make my own judgement.'  If you want oscar-calibur movies go see 'Elizabeth,' or 'The Thin Red Line.'  Also, 'Life Is Beautiful' is really good.",4,1,4,7 April 1999
Coyote Ugly," Mediocre Film
","The would be a film to test my fast-forward button.  The lamest of a triple feature (also the last, but that isn't why it was lame), the movie has a see-through plot that everybody has seen before.  Country girl goes to big city with dreams, gets robbed, finds job, **Spoiler**, makes it.  So why would anybody go see this.  Because of great marketing!!  This has the best, most deceptive marketing strategy ever.  Why?  It got guys into the theater, didn't it?The bar scenes were cool, and they are the only good thing about the movie. I wanted to know how many people in the audience actually cared about the plot.  The bar scenes were limited, and the plot was overdone.  I didn't care about Violet's problems.  I wanted to see more T&A.  But, emotions overruled, and so we got stuck with a lame movie that tests the fast-forward button.  We just want to see stories around the bar.  A story centering around the bar owner, by way of Violet would have been better, in my opinion.  So, because of the plot getting in the way of my entertainment.6/10",6,0,0,12 August 2000
Mission: Impossible II," pared-down john woo
","When I first heard that John Woo was doing another movie, I thought great. When I heard that it was mission: impossible 2, I thought awesome.  When I learned on Tuesday before it came out that 40 minutes had been cut out, I became leery.  Yes, you heard me right, this is not the director's cut of the movie.  OK, maybe it is, but it is not the first cut.  Apparently the first cut was patent John Woo with more violence, going for an 'R' rating, and much less romance.  It was John Woo, but then the studio brought in a guy who cut 40 minutes out, and added some romance between the two characters.  But enough of that, the actual movie review:This is not John Woo.  It had some parts in it that were great, but the movie's pacing was sort of off, and the action scenes were a bit choppy. The rhythm that Woo generally has is absent.  See the scene in Face/Off featuring Somewhere over the rainbow for a good example of that, or the church.  But Woo is a master, and studios should not tough that.  The plot is inane, but I didn't care.  My point was that it should have been fun and more intense.  Either way, I don't think that I could sit through this again, except for if they restore it.  I can't wait for the DVD, maybe they restored the first cut, but until then see Gladiator.  I sat through that twice, and would go again.----5",5,0,0,29 May 2000
Black Hawk Down," violent, bloody, technically wonderful, but strangely off
","I really really like Ridley Scott.  I wanted him to make a great movie.  I wanted to like the movie.  I wanted another war movie to add to my likes list (currently only 3 are on it - Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, and Thin Red Line - and 2 maybe war: Crimson Tide and Hunt for Red October). This movie did not add itself to the roster.  *SPOILERS AHEAD* It had a really good intro, that was probably manipulative, but for somebody who was 11-12 when the events occurred.  So, i was hoping for something substantial.  I got a story of how everything broke down, and that was interesting.  But, there were several problems with the movie.  One big beef I had was I never got to know the characters enough to care about them. Some have already said that it was the point, but for the surgery to really work as emotion instead of gory shock, we should know and care for the soldier like his partners.  Also, there was almost a checklist of stereotypes used.  Tough and mean-spirited general, check.  Rebellious crew, check.  Humanitarian, check. There were more.  And while i am sure hat the stereotypes were at the heart of these characters, I am sure that they were more than these base characters.  Other complaints include that this is one big disjointed battle.  You never focus on any one group long enough to know them or what their situation is.What was up with the final speech?  Did he really say that?  Was my stomach churning over heartfelt words really said over a dead body?  Or was this a reshoot in our new found nationalistic obsession for heroes, and finding them in the NYFD/PD?  It seemed like a forced new scene made just for this situation.  And the whole movie was patriotic, but I guess people really are in the military.  How else could you survive if you didn't believe in your country enough to die for it?  But, it still seemed to have a bias that dying for your nation is a great thing even if it isn't for anything protective of the US.  And it even condemned us nay-sayers by putting negative words in the mouth of the 'bad guys.' *END SPOILERS*The movie could have been good, but I was just sighing and looking at my watch by the end of it.  It was boring because it was repetitive.  I guess people need war movies like old ones in this day of age, but I still would never add this movie to the top ten of my list, or even in the better half. It was a decent movie that had major flaws.  I am waiting for windtalkers, but not for either of the other two war movies coming out.

There's Something About Mary," There's something about 'There's something about mary.'
","Why do people take offense to lowbrow humor?  This was one of the only movies in which I was in tears because I was laughing so hard.  'Dumb and Dumber' was OK and 'Kingpin' was pretty good, they didn't have much substance to then.  'There's Something About Mary' had heart and gross-out humor making a genius movie.  Most movies depend on one or the other. 
Sure it was about stalkers but poltical correctness is not a good thing, and that is what this movie is against.  I know people who were offended by it big time, but still laughed at it.  I think any movie which gets you to laugh and enjoy yourself is a good movie.  Other movies are just mediocre. 
To those who hate low-brow humor and gross-out gags, why don't you get them? I say you should lighten up and enjoy yourselves.  Let loose.  Your going to be entertained and let yourselves be entertained.  Not everything has to be intellectual and make you think.  Either that, or you have no sense of humor.",10,0,0,16 August 1998
Enemy at the Gates," The most obvious propaganda
","OK, I first have o admit that I was coerced into seeing this movie.  I had heard many good things about it, and the fact that it wasn't an America vs. movie intrigued me.  I hoped that this would be an evenly told story that had no ulterior motives.  Boy was I wrong.This movie is probably one of the most obvious pieces of pro-war propaganda since John Wayne was alive.  'U-571' is a little close, but nowhere near as obvious as this.  Morals of the story: germans were bad, russians were good, sex leads to failure.  That last one could be derived from the result of one of the funniest, and most gratuitous sex scenes in film history (including Caligula).  What happened because of death?  The hero couldn't perform his duties.I liked the fact that EVERYBODY spoke English.  But, that paled in comparison to the fact that Finnes had a constant five-o-clock shadow, but was never clean shaven.  That was amusing.  The love story was lacking, the war story was lacking, about the only thing that wasn't lacking was the strange accents.  The best part of the movie was that it was about propaganda.  I don't know if that was supposed to have any sort of effect on the final shot.******SPOILERS********  The final shot was the ultra hero shot.  With Finnes looking up and to the right (with his head at the left side of the screen), and the light glowing from the right side of the screen in his face.  He's Superman!!  Bleh.  Also, the foreshadowing was obvious, the movie was put together so horribly that I found nothing intriguing about it.  Russians are going to win, Fiennes will be the result, he'll get the girl. 
If you want a good war movie, rent Full Metal Jacket, Apocolypse Now, The Thin Red Line.  Something not so obvious.  Don't rent this tripe.

Bring It On," Surprisingly good
","OK, I really liked this movie.  Yes, its a juvenile movie with lots of bad jokes, but it is a movie that isn't crude and pokes fun at itself in a childish manner.  It had a dark sense of humor without being too dark.  It poked fun at its subjects without losing all respect for them.  It kind of did not know what it was at the same time that it tried to hard to be exactly what it was, and for all of these things, it was pretty funny, if you don't expect too much.The dialogue has to be some of the funniest, self-depreciating dialogue I have ever heard.  From 'My whole cheerleading life has been a lie' to 'Don't be a cheer-tator,' this consistently brought laughs throughout the movie. Also having some great lines was Ian Roberts, who played the drill instructor in the movie, who was Antoine from Upright Citizens Brigade.  He did not lose that edge he had on everybody else.The plot was one of those ridiculously lame plots that deserved to be skewered.  The ending was the best part of it, which I will not reveal to you.  However, if you know me and my tastes, you can probably tell what the ending is.  If you don't know the plot, you should watch the trailer.The movie is a satire of sorts that has some sort of respect for the cheerleaders, and therefore, has some slower parts, but it was generally a fast paced movie.  So, I recommend this to everybody who needs a good laugh in mainstream theaters after this lame summer.8/10",8,0,0,6 September 2000
Blow," more drug analyzing
","OK, I liked this movie better than Traffic.  That insulted my intelligence and meant it too.  This movie isn't full of intelligence, but its not the director's intent.  He wants to make a crafty movie, but all he pretty much knows is schlock.  He did The Ref (Denis Leary driver).  'Nuff said.This movie had some decent roles.  Johnny Depp is in another drug movie, Ray Liotta (this is the third new movie I have seen him in this week Hannibal and The Heartbreakers were the others) is in another Goodfellas, and Penelope Cruz did decent in her manipulative female role.  The acting was as good as you could expect from this kind of movie.  Paul Rubens was, um, interesting as a homosexual drug dealer, but he was fun.  I guess that is the only thing different about this movie from every other one, is that its fun.The plot of this movie (which is a true story, and the film is 6 years in the making), is basically 2nd half of Goodfellas mixed with Requiem for a Dream.  But its the nice version of it all.  Its the all-American version as the titles so eloquently present.  Low down: Guy grows up poor, decides he wants to be rich, gets hooked up with drug dealing.  We watch as his dealing progresses through the decades.  He then is busted not once, not twice, but three times.  And the third time is supposed to be a tearjerker.  He gives up all he loves for his dream of living a peaceful life with his daughter.The editing is straight out of the Goodfellas college.  Chock full of freeze frames, pauses, and just an overall feeling of crumbling goodness, the movie owed more to Scorcese than to Demme.  The narrative, all in flashback (ala Goodfellas) is told with distinct settings for the years and obvious music throughout.  And, no, I am not the only one who remembers Goodfellas, one of the greatest movies of all time.  The big reminder is in Ray Liotta, this time father of Henry Hill.But, you may get the hint that I thought the movie was utterly worthless. I didn't. It was fun in a mindless what am I watching sort of way.  I would recommend watching Goodfellas for a mafia/drug syndicate movie, and Requiem for a drug syndicate/destruction of American dream movie.  But, if you want a sugar-coated pill, see this movie.  Not to mention the movie offers nothing new on the topics of drug trafficing (not like Traffic did either people).  But, it was mildly entertaining. 6/10",6,0,0,23 March 2001
Shrek," Hilarious comedy for adults (at least)
","OK, I admit, I didn't watch this movie looking to see it as a kid, or if it was made for kids.  Hell, I'm practically a kid myself (although from some of the movies I've seen, you never could tell).  This movie made me laugh out loud, and I loved almost every minute of it.  It was a great slaying of the traditional fairy tale, and of Disney and everything else.  And, yes, it is a dark movie in parts.  Comments have included the facts that Riverdance parodies are tired, and why the song 'All-Star?'  Well, first, Riverdance parodies may be just hitting the kid level (last year, it may have seemed tired in Scary Movie [to me], but kids shouldn't have seen that one).  Kids get things that are more popular nowadays, and they hold onto it for annoyingly longer periods of time.  Look at the phenomenon of the Nickelodeon's embrace of Baja Men's 'Who Let the Dogs Out.'  That was still being played long after I had grown tired of hearing it at frat parties.However, the best parts are in the beginning, especially.  The dark twists on every fairy tale that you know (and maybe even some I didn't), were just great.  The rest of the movie was pretty good too, but Donkey got annoying at times.  That may have been the point.  I dunno, but I highly recommend this one for adults, especially if you like your comedy slightly tainted. If you don't mind poking fun at dear things a little, and having fun.  Check this one out.8/10",Null,0,0,20 May 2001
Vanilla Sky," Damn Hollywood, damn it to HELL!
","Well, I hate hollywood, but love cinema so i have to watch these cruddy movies in theaters.  And, I was hoping Vanilla Sky would be good.  i was hoping that they would either keep the original 'Open Your Eyes' exactly the same, or they would make it their own.  Well, it happened to be a little bit of both, and it sucked.It started out good.  I love Radiohead.  I wish there was more of that. But by the end we are listening to Good Vibrations by The Beach Boys.  Talk about a wide range of suck between.  They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple others, but why oh why did they have to blare GV during the climax.  It was more annoying than confusing or blatant. Especially when it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT.  At least put some meaning behind the songs.  Kid A = primary.  Whatever.He also did a bang up job with the club scene.  That was cool.  Otherwise the movie was one big ball of arrogance.  As if audiences would get the movie.  The ones that would get it read subtitles, and the rest won't. Its as simple as that.  The motivations got all screwed up.  I didn't comprehend the Diaz motivations (hadn't they done the Chicken Soup night before?) and some of the others.  And I hate Kurt Russell.  Stay overboard.  Tom Cruise can't act (especially in these types of movie [i.e. Eyes Wide Shut]).  And the elevator.  I get it.  Anyways they tried improving the original with a crappy american rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good film print and glossy processing and it would have helped if crowe hadn't screwed it up.

The Matrix," Mindblowing!
","No, I am not quoting from a famous writer, that is what I feel! I should have been getting bored of watching movies because I saw 'Out of Sight' on Friday, 'Reefer Madness' on Saturday, 'EdTV' on Sunday, '8MM' on Monday, 'Lord of Illusions' on Tuesday, and this movie on Wednesday.  After a line up like that, generally I would be getting bored of movies, but I loved this movie.  This movie held my attention all the way through its 2 hours+Plot:  I cannot explain it.  'You'll have to see it for yourself.'  The concept is strange, and I liked it.  It explains a lot.  I could just barely follow the plot as the movie was flying by at breakneck speed (although the plot wasn't).  It is complicated, so pay attention.  If you like mind-numbing movies, wait for summer action flix to come out.Acting:  It was decent.  I mean, Keanu Reeves sucks as an actor, but Fishburne rocks.  He is one of the hottest actors of current cinema.  Don't miss 'Pulp Fiction.'  The actress is good, but good looking too.  Man was she hot in her clothes.  You can surpass the acting for the rest of the movie though.Action and Effects:Outstanding.  Easily the best effects for a long time. The bullets, and the staging were great.  The choreographed action scenes looked like they were from John Woo. The effects were all over the place. This is one of the movies where the actors don't take the back seat to the effects.  They actually work with them, and it seems to work.  The action sequences were many, and it was great.  Definitely see this movie in the theater because of the effects, and sound, and because it is wide-widescreen.  (It has a 2.33:1 ratio, whereas with formatted movies, they cut off the sides to make it 1.33:1. That is 3/7 or almost half of the screen.)The music is awesome techno; metal; rock and roll.  I will definitely buy the soundtrack.  Stay for credits when Marilyn Manson's 'Rock Is Dead' is played through movie theater-quality speakers.  Perfection.Do not miss this movie in theaters.  It is one of the best action movies since 'Face-off,' and one of the best sci-fi flicks ever, esp. since 'Alien.'  I give this movie a nine because it had some hokiness, and cliches, but all movie so anyways.------------9",9,0,0,9 April 1999
The Replacements," Thoroughly Entertaining
","Of a triple feature, this was the best one of the three.  It was the middle one.  It was really funny.  The movie is a light-hearted movie that doesn't care who it steals from, nor what happens, as long as it entertains.  And entertains it does.  I am not the type to fall for generic, run-of-the-mill type movie, yet I liked this movie.  It was a tamer version of 'Major League' football style.The Plot:  'Major League' with a dash of 'Any Given Sunday.'  The players are on strike, and the team has to come up with a winning group of losers. Next, the players have to win three out of the only four games left in the season.  In the meantime, the owner has chosen a coach that he had fired years ago.The acting: Your regular cheeze0ball comedy acting.  Nobody is going to win any Oscars for the range of emotions shown in the movie, but at least the acting was pretty good.*Spoilers Ahead**Spoilers Ahead* So, why did I like it?  The strippers as cheerleaders was stolen from the cruder 'BASEketball.'  Yet they worked to make me laugh.  The overly aggressive football player made me laugh hard.  The three fat guys getting mad at each other was funny.  The bodyguards (same people) worked, and even the overplaying of 'I Will Survive' (I saw Coyote Ugly last, and it had the song right at the beginning, what made the song get its comeback?) worked for its humor.  The movie just clicked.  Not that I would see it over and over, but it was a really funny movie that I highly recommend to anyone looking for a not-so-crude laugh (and there were some crude ones, I'm not saying that it was saintly, but next to Me Myself and Irene...), and some good escapism, see this one.8/10",8,0,1,12 August 2000
Jackie Brown," Great Movie!
","I loved this movie, but then I loved everything else Tarentino has had his hands in.  I loved True Romance and Natural Born Kilers, especially the courtroom scene, which was all his.  This movie is not typical Tarantino because it was based on a book not written by Tarantino.  It was based on a book by Elmore Leonard orginally called Rum Punch.  Elmore Leonard is another master of the dialogue, and he should be credited for much of the story and dialogue.  The movie dragged because it was a copy of the book, only missing a few scenes.  I loved the way the movie was done, and it was fabulous.  I love Elmore Leonard and Tarantino.  The dialogue between the two was almost perfect.  However, I think that Tarantino fans of his first two films should not see this expecting the same type of fare.  This is Leonard-land, and it is a glorious place.",Null,1,1,30 August 1998
True Romance," Great, sappy, romantic movie
","This movie is so awesome.  It is one of the very few romantic movies that I love.  Generally, I refuse to see movie such as City of Angels, You've Got Mail, and I hated Sleepless in Seattle and Pretty Woman.  But, this movie was the second best romantic and cliched movie I have seen.  The best was Bonnie and Clyde, and that was probably original.*****SPOILERS*****SPOILERS***** Plot: Semi-sappy plot that would generally make me gag.  Guy and Prostitute fall in love.  Guy kills pimp, and runs with cocaine stash.  They plan on selling it to big producer for money to escape.  It was mentioned before that we should hate them for being drug dealers, and I think that the general public should not like it, but who would do crazy things for a little thing called love?  Every single action in the movie is done out of love and dedication.  Their ultimate goal is to run away and have a family.Acting:  Decent.  Slater was Slater.  However, in this movie, he was somewhat toned down from his normal Nicholson-esque acting, and you could see some emotion.  You could tell that the couple were truly in love, and it works really well.  The best roles were the secondary characters (although, Arquette is, as mostly, superb).  Brad Pitt as a pothead, Walken as a drug lord, Val Kilmer as Elvis, Gary Oldman as a pimp.  All of these roles are just perfect.The whole movie is done with enough finesse that you almost, but not quite, forget about all of the cliches in the movie.  The violence is over-the-top, almost no consequences in the movie, and it is almost a fantasy world, like how people feel when in love for the first time.  Highly recommended to all romantic types as a cross-over introduction to the violent cinema, and to all violent cinema lovers as a intro to romantic movies (it may not fully change you however.9/10",7,1,2,3 September 2000
V for Vendetta," P for Provoking
","V for Vendetta (2006); Dir: James McTeigue Remember Remember the Fifth of November' is much like 'Remember the Alamo,' but, in V For Vendetta, the British rhyme is used more like Fox News Channel's constant recalling of 9/11. And, why not, as V For Vendetta has been rewritten to boldly extend the current state of the United States, and question our leadership and media coverage.If V For Vendetta makes you a bit uncomfortable in its heroic bombing of landmarks, it may have done part of its job. But, is the audience ready for a call to rebellion yet? V For Vendetta opens with a theatricality which cuts in and out of the movie, as you see Evey (Natalie Portman) getting ready for a date with Gordon Deitrich (Stephen Fry), while V dons his Phantom of the Opera mask to go out for the night. As Evey is caught after curfew and about to be molested by roaming bands of government-hired enforcers, V swoops in and rescues her from her fate. V takes the saved heroine to a rooftop to watch his late-night demolition of Old Bailey, a British landmark.Naturally, the national news station has a field day with the story. But, V takes the Government news station hostage to send his own message that in a year, there will be a revolution.You see, in this futuristic world, the British government has been taken over by a Hitler-style government leader, Adam Sutler (John Hurt) who has been broadly painted to look like Hitler and George W. Bush. It becomes at once a tale of 'What would happen if the Third Reich had become the one remaining world power' and 'What the US as the Third Reich would do.' In addition to painting Sutler equally like George W. Bush and Hitler, it also takes jabs at America and her penchant for starting wars, citing this as a leading cause of the Sutler rise to power.If the movie seems a bit confused to what it is, its probably because it tried to chew a little too much off. It at once attempts to be a combination of blockbuster action, fantasy, superhero comic book, science-fiction parable, and fairy tale. It also is, at once, Orwell's 1984 with the theatricality of The Phantom of the Opera, with a bit of Farenheit 451 thrown in for good measure. On top of all this, it becomes an indictment of America, American government, by creating its downfall, and creating an uprising resembling our current leader.V For Vendetta is a very ambitious movie for a first-time director, and its easy to tell where the Wachowski's stepped in on his style. Considering James McTeigue worked as first assistant director on all three Matrix movies, and the Wachowski brothers wrote the script for V For Vendetta, it is challenging not to make comparisons to the former movies. The Wachowskis made The Matrix by deftly weaving armchair philosophy, martial arts, science-fiction, neo-noir, and blockbuster action into a fluid cinematic tapestry the likes of which had not been seen before. Since they wrote the screenplay for V For Vendetta, and produced it, it is hard to say where their participation ended, but they were trying for a deftly woven fabric here as well.However, McTeigue may not have been up to the task. McTiegue's visual sensibilities are rather meager, and his cinematic language not deep enough to keep the movie into a single flowing unit. With a few gorgeously made sets, and the occasional brilliant frame, V For Vendetta is its own worst nightmare, as it shows brilliance in the portions of what could have been. More than a few different portions of the movie were flat and seemed rather pedestrian in the visual choice.But, the real star of the movie was not the visuals, it was the screenplay and the ideas behind it. Essentially, the Wachowski Brothers made a call to action for the ousting of our President, if not the restarting of the American government. Don't kid yourselves viewers, the transfer to Britain was mainly used as a white rabbit, and to keep the Guy Fawkes mask (who is not known by the American populace). The script goes from idea to idea, sometimes fully exploring one or two, and having a decent fixation on the plight of the homosexual.But, whether or not the audience is ready to see terrorist bombings used heroically is a challenge. Not only is it a challenge due to the fact that bombings are nasty things, it is a challenge as we associate bombings with the evil Middle Eastern Religious Fanatics. It raises the question, do those terrorists have a point to their bombings? Are they trying to get out from under the foot of an oppressive government? I think that, which I find happenstance, the movie comes out on the same weekend as Operation Swarmer makes an interesting comment on how we should be questioning our government.So, is the movie good? It depends on why you go to the movies. If you go to the movies for an easy action movie, you may have come to the wrong place. If you're looking for eye candy, there's been better. If you don't mind having your mind provoked, this is the best place to be.B+",8,2,6,19 March 2006
