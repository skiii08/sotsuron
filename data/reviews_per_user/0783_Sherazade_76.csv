Insidious: Chapter 2," The Hunter, Ninja & Bear guys ruined this one...
","part one was much scarier and much more focused, this one was all over the place even though I get why it was. How did I know they would take 'The Exorcist' approach to explain why that particular ghost singled out Josh to haunt since his childhood? I have to say I am glad this one wasn't as scary as the first because there is only so much the heart can take but that said I wish they would have dialed down the comic relief offered up by Elise's associates; Specs and what's his face? Initially, they were welcomed scene-robbers but their sch-tick got very old very quickly and they ended up settling just for being annoying additional characters. As we all suspected from the ending of part one, it wasn't Josh who came back into his body after rescuing his son Dalton from 'the further' and part two pretty much picks up from where part one left off and we get a back-story into the world that Josh's mum had suppressed when he was a child.",6,1,1,13 January 2014
The Avengers," As close as we'll ever get to perfection
","I challenge anyone who did not or does not think this was a 10/10 film to make a better version. People, especially picky ones just like to nitpick for the sake of doing so. When I saw this film, I did not even go in expecting to be blown away or anything but that happened any way and so much more. Marvel's 'Avengers Assemble' was such and ambitious project because they were tasked with not only bringing together some of the greatest superheroes every written but also making it work. Each one of these heroes (Thor, captain America, Iron man, Black widow, Hawk eye, The hulk) can helm and deliver their own action packed titular vehicle in their own right, so taming the egos (which did flare up during the course of the film) long enough to get the job done was also a commendable task that was accomplished here as was the amazing chemistry shared among all the cast members. Centering the main plot around the alien force of energy known as 'the tesseract' (which has been a subject in other Marvel flicks) was also brilliant. The sub-plots of Natasha's skill set, Loki playing up the hulk and Nick Fury and the S.H.I.E.L.D's insidious agenda for regaining 'the tesseract' were also spot on. Iron man/Tony Stark's amazing one-liners had me in stitches, he was even funnier here than he is in his own movies.",10,1,4,1 June 2014
Resident Evil: Afterlife," All a fan of the video game could ask for
","This was easily the best film of the entire series so far, in my humble opinion. I am a fan of the video game which is why I was glad to see them create a version of the film that is as close to the way things occur in the game. The way Alice would go somewhere and suddenly spot someone and that person would begin to follow her around the game until their services are needed or revealed and their skills displayed etc. etc. I especially loved all the additional characters and the plot twists and the way this film ended like just as the next installment should begin. I really have nothing bad to say, I have only given it 9/10 instead of 10/10 because in some spots the editing seemed patchy, especially in the scenes before Alice went to look for Arcadia. But other than that the film was as close to the video game and as visually stunning thus far.",9,1,4,11 April 2011
Deja Vu," It should have been called TWO Fat Agents or TWO fat Cops, I dunno but something FAT!
","Okay let's face it, I don't know if either Denzel Washington or Val Kilmer were told to gain weight for their roles either ways, they were FAT! I'm sorry to sound vain but if they had been Hollywood Actresses, more people would have pointed out this fact. I just couldn't get over how fat they had gotten and so I had to get that off of my chest. Phew! Okay, I'm good. Now on to the movie, which I didn't really like either-ways.The film centers around an ATF agent Doug Carlin (played by a FAT Denzel Washington) who one morning responds to a ferry bombing attack in downtown New Orleans and during the course of the investigation comes to realise that a young woman Claire Kuchever (played by Paula Patton) whose body washed up on the banks of the New Orleans river hours before the explosion seems to be tied to the terrorist attack. Agent Carlin, who falls in love with Kuchever's corpse then embarks on the seemingly impossible task of connecting the two crimes, in the hopes of bringing her killer to justice. Carlin is assisted by Agent Andrew Pryzwarra (played by a FAT Val Kilmer, who by the way has very little to do in this film) who introduces him to a team of surveillance investigators headed by Denny (played by a very geeky looking Adam Goldberg). This surveillance team happens to be in possession of a (okay let me put this simply) time machine that allows one to travel 4 days back in real time, hence the title: Deja Vu. If you don't get that, then I'm sorry you'll just have to go watch the movie because trust me, it took both me and Denzel's character 10 headaches and 2 tantrums to get it too. LOL! All in all, it was good entertainment but not without its faults. How Jim Caviezel thought it was okay to play such a role as he did in this film, after portraying Jesus Christ, it light years beyond me. There are some things you just don't do in life. You don't dress Hrithik Roshan up as a Priest (they did in Dhoom 2), you don't cast Brad Pitt as Jesus Christ (thank God nobody has made that Faux Pas yet, and here's hoping they never do) and you certainly DO NOT cast Jesus Christ (nor the man who played him) as a TERRORIST! I dunno who to blame, casting or Jim himself. I was too unnerved to even judge whether for versatility sake he was good or bad -- acting wise. He reminded me of Keanu Reeves in THE WATCHER -- another poor casting decision. Another thing that irked me about this film was the character Shanti (played by Erika Alexander), she was so annoying to begin with then she just had to add two Faux/forced crying scenes? Her acting in this was painful at best.",7,0,1,28 January 2007
Gravity," Impressive but I felt like I watched it while it was being edited
","things happened so fast and before I knew it, Ryan Stone was saying 'thank you' and the credits were rolling. I like movies that come to the point immediately but this one was a little too 'boom, bang, bing.' Aside from that feeling, it was a brilliant albeit not very scientifically accurate film. A group of astronauts are making repairs on a Hubble Space Telescope when they receive an emergency alert from the Houston command centre to abandon their mission and begin re-entry into the earth's atmosphere immediately. Apparently a missile strike to destroy an abandoned Russian satellite is sending speeding debris their way. Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) a medical engineer (on her first mission into space) initially hesitates to abandon her tasks but is given an order by mission commander Matthew Kowalski (George Clooney) a veteran astronaut (on his last mission into space before retirement) and she finally obliges. Stone soon realises the severity of the situation when their colleague, flight engineer Shariff (Phaldut Sharma) is momentarily struck and killed by flying debris before he can detach himself from the equipment he was working on. Soon after they lose contact with Houston mission control, Stone panics and the consequences of her reactions leaves her drifting off into space until she is rescued by Kowalski. Further panic and lack of experience on Stone's part leads to further complications in their escape plan as they proceed to investigate the impact of the damage on their ship, retrieve Shariff's body and plot a mission to reach the damaged International Space Station (ISS) in order to retrieve a shuttle to get them to the Chinese Space Station Tiangong that is slowly falling back to earth. Brilliant acting and emoting by Bullock, she pretty much owned the entire movie, Clooney was more like a supporting actor and just cake walked through his part. Definitely an achievement in cinematography.",8,1,5,6 June 2014
Wind River," Strong performances by all involved
","An incredibly difficult subject to watch and I'm sure it was just as difficult to tackle for the cast and crew as well. I found myself getting increasingly upset as the story unfolded, without giving too much away, there is just no excuse for the mistreatment indigenous people, no excuse at all.",9,6,10,18 September 2017
Iron Man 2," Very good but falls short of excellence.
","I felt the characters of Samuel L Jackson and Scarlett Johansson(I'm sure I have spelt her name wrong) were given far too little to do and in fact were under-developed especially for a person like me who does not know too much about comic books (as a matter of fact I do not remember the Iron man saga from my childhood at all, must have missed it or something). But I guess it is to be expected in such an action packed film that focuses mainly on Tony Stark aka Iron Man and his best-friends Pepper Potts and Rhody. Mickey Rourke is like a cat with nine lives, the guy just keeps giving as many comebacks as he can possibly be expected to churn out and keeps getting better with age, his Russian accent was so authentic that whenever I looked away from the screen while he was talking, he sounded exactly like my Russian co-worker. I can't wait for part 3.",9,0,1,29 September 2010
Two for the Money," Two for the swearing!
","As a Newyorker, I refuse to believe that there are people in this city who swear so much that you absolutely can hardly understand a word of what they are saying. That was the case with this film in which Al Pacino (in another shout-fest villainous role) plays a betting chief who one day rescues a former NFL champion (played by Mattew McConaughey) who was abandoned by his father, from the eternal damnation known as working in a cubicle, by flying him out to Newyork and offering him a job as sports betting main protégé. It all seems too good to be true for Brandon Lang (McConaughey) who is suspicious of everything going on around him but allows himself to be recruited anyway. He starts well and climbs up the ladder with such lightening speed that in infuriates a former protégé played by Jeremy Piven whom Brandon eventually replaces. Everything about Al Pacino's sinister Walter Abrams is a test, he tests to the point of no return and eventually does himself in when Brandon (whom Walter makes over to be this alter ego character of John something...) walks away at the top of his game. Jamie King (ever the typecast slut) makes a cameo as a, yeah, you guessed it, slut. Rene Russo, who seems to get only better and more beautiful with age co-stars as Mrs. Abrams, a woman whom Brandon can hardly resist much to the dismay of her husband. And Armand Asante makes a special appearance as a weirdo mob type dude who relieves himself on McConaughey's character! Poor Matthew, here's hoping your payday was very shiny and green! As I said before, the swearing was a little bit much for me, and I'm a Newyorker, so there you go. The film was based on true life events that occurred in the life of the real Brandon Lang, a body building former pro-gambler whom you can see in the special features section of the DVD.",6,2,2,3 July 2006
World War Z," Almost perfect
","it still earns high marks from me despite all its flaws. I was thoroughly entertained and the plot seemed decent and semi-original enough lead by a wonderful leading man and numerous fantastic supporting actors and actresses. The only things I did not like were the CGI-Zekes (or zombies) as I felt there wasn't a need to mutate them to a point whereby some of them looked completely computer generated and also the outbreak itself and what it took to contain it. When you look at some of the most epic disease-themed-disaster-flicks (Outbreak, Contagion, War of the Worlds, The Happening, Blindness & even the Resident Evil saga) they begin with mass chaos brought about by something seemingly minute and frivolous and end with something equally trite yet mind-boggling as its resolution. Granted, World War Z blew the standard wind open by not having to depend on patient zero to come up with its solution but it still had its issues one of which was if you can wrap your head around why Brad Pitt's character had to travel all the way to Israel to get the answers he needed to complete the puzzle given him by a seemingly crazy prisoner he met by chance in South Korea (I mean what if he hadn't even noticed or paid attention to that prisoner?) and why when he got to Israel and got his answers did he not speak up sooner warning the singing, shouting and chanting people that the Zekes (zombies) were attracted to loud sounds? Why would that flight attendant on that flight to Wales open the lift compartment upon hearing such a weird sound given the circumstances? Why wouldn't she try to protect herself first given all that she had seen previously in Israel and what are the odds that only Pitt's character and the female soldier would survive the plane crash? Too convenient. I have so many questions but for the sake of peace and entertainment, I'll let them go. Another thing that stood out to me while watching this was how Pitt's adventures in the film seemed in some way to eerily mirror his real life adventures of adopting children and globe-trotting and peacekeeping and problem-solving for the world but then again its his home production and he can very well do whatever the heck he feels like doing so long as he produces something entertaining and worthwhile, which he did here.",9,1,2,24 April 2014
Passengers," Entertaining
","I hadn't even ever heard of the film until I found myself watching it and I must say I was thoroughly entertained and surprised especially by Chris Pratt's (who for a great deal of the running time was alone on screen) acting skills. Jennifer Lawrence is Jennifer Lawrence, she is always going to give you that. Great chemistry, great acting, decent plot. I loved it.",8,2,2,29 October 2017
The Hunger Games," Watching as a Jennifer Lawrence fan...
","not as a fan of the books (which I intend to read having seen the first film) and was pleasantly surprised that not only was this film as imaginative as it was daunting to take in the disparity between the social classes that forms the basis of the plot and essentially plays out throughout its course, Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) truly shines even in commercial cinema. I discovered her a few years ago having seen her in a couple of small films I'm sure no one else saw ('The Burning Plain', 'The Poker House') and I'm glad that the world has now discovered her rare talent on such a monumental scale with brilliant turns in 'The X-Men', 'Silver linings Playbook' and now 'The Hunger Games' series.",8,1,6,27 May 2014
Rang De Basanti," Incredible!
","I started out not liking this film but by the end, I was in tears, I was inspired and most importantly, my life was different from they way it was before I saw the film, which I think was the director's ultimate goal. I learned two things from this movie and the first one is that things will always be the same if we all just sit down and do nothing about it, and the second thing is that we, the people who live in this day and age are a disgrace to our freedom fighters of the past. I don't just mean this for India, but for everywhere in the world where the fight for freedom has been a price selflessly paid by people just like you and I. Rang De Basanti is the story of seven friends, one of whom is a British national who comes to India to shoot a documentary based on the accounts of her grandfather who was a first hand witness to the Legend of Bhagat Singh and his friends. When she reaches India, she is shocked by the way the youth of today seems to have little or no understanding of their very recent past and how Westernised they had all become. She meets six friends, five boys and one girl of which she quickly becomes their 7th. She recruits them to star in her documentary and with this, she unites them all and makes them become aware of what is going on in their surroundings. But maybe her inspiration goes a little too far and by the end of the film, you just have to wonder if she blames herself for what happens and if so how she would live with herself. The element I liked the most about the film, was how in the end, this British girl's life is forever changed as she finds herself the 21st century updated version of the troubled person her grandfather was on those very pages she was inspired by, and those very pages that would haunt her forever.",10,1,6,18 March 2006
Star Trek Into Darkness," Good but could have been better...
","The budget for this film was 190 million???? Seriously??? Why??? I mean I know in order to make a good sci-fi flick (especially with one that already has a strong fan-following and back story which begun decades ago and also revolutionized technology for story lines as such back then) you have to go all out but seriously was spending nearly 200 million necessary? Never mind the fact that this installment of the 'Star Trek' series went so overboard with its grandiose main plots and sub-plots that ten more films and perhaps other franchises could have been spawned from the material used in just this one film. The cast was excellent (as they were in the previous film) and the visuals were remarkable but there were way too many characters fighting for screen time & acknowledgment that the writers/editors should have just stuck to the 'Khan' story line and fleshed it out instead of the slew of after-thought-like sub-plots which were so clumsily shot and poorly executed, especially towards the climax of the film.",7,2,4,10 January 2014
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," One of the best films of 2005!
","It's a portrait of cinematographic excellence!Four children are sent to live in the countryside for the duration of a war, in order to keep safe. While at the estate of their caretaker, the youngest child discovers a wardrobe that leads into an alternate world in which a prophecy holds that she and the rest of her siblings are destined to come and save the people of Narnia from the rule of an evil white witch who calls herself the queen of Narnia (and is played to perfection by the icy Tilda Swinton). Many elements in the film are very similar to Christian belief, for instance the Lion can be thought to be representative of Jesus Christ if you look within the context.The soundtrack is especially exquisite, especially that one song by Alanis Morrissette and that 'I can't take it all in' song.Jim Broadbent and Liam Neeson co-star.",10,3,5,20 June 2006
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Poor Jake, stuck in a horrid movie...
","Gemma Arteton as the princess Tamina killed the movie, in a horrible way. Every young British actress today feels like she has to shape her acting ability around the acting styles of Kate Winslet, Catherine Zeta Jones and/or Rachel Weisz. Be yourselves people!!!! I cannot stress that enough. I couldn't even buy this girl as the princess because she just looked like she was doing a confused job at aping Rachel Weisz from the Mummy movies, Kate Winslet's Rose Dewitt Bukater with a hint of Catherine Zeta Jones from the Mask of Zorro. It didn't help that the hair and makeup people seemed to share Arteton's dream of wanting to resemble CZJ. That said, I thought Jake Gyllenhaal did a fantastic job as the agile prince Dastan and his British accent was so spot on that I was beginning to think they'd dubbed it. Fortunately enough for Gyllenhaal, he has such good looks that when shown against Arteton, their chemistry just bounces of the screen and adds to their rapport. Alfred Molina is amazing as cunning Sheik Amar as is Sir Ben Kingsley in his villainous uncle Nizam role. I appreciated the nod to the video game from which the film was inspired, especially with the action sequences and scenic adventures. All in all the film is watchable (a one time watch for me because I do not think I could stomache Arteton a second time around) but there have been better films. See 'The Mummy' or even 'The Time Machine' instead.",5,0,2,23 August 2011
Billy Elliot," Okay
","A young lad (Jamie Bell) struggles with coming of age and with his true identity growing up tough and with lots of expectations almost outright demanded of him. Julie Waters (in a strong Oscar nominated role) plays his ballet teacher, who despite all odds and obstacles pushing the boy hard enough to begin believing in his dream again. His father wants to to plays tough sports like boxing or football but his heart wants him to dance. While tragedy and all sorts of dysfunction surround him on ever side, Billy manages to overcome all adversities to become one of the greatest and most talked about company dancers in history. Gary Lewis, Stuart Wells, Billy Fane and Nicola Blackwell among others lend powerful presence as hilarious and sometimes heartbreaking co-stars.",7,0,2,1 September 2006
Spice World," The worst excuse for a film I have ever seen!
","It was beyond awful but I still enjoyed it. I watched it when it came out back then (of course I was much younger and appreciated it then) but then it came on telly a few nights ago and I just cringed. How do films like this get made? I wish somebody could tell me. It's really pathetic.Anyways, it's supposed to be a film about the life of the spice girls before they became famous, on the road en route to stardom and at the height of their fame. And you wouldn't believe the amount of acting talented they wasted on this film and yet have nothing to show for it. I mean, I'm talking every British celebrity from Roger Moore to Irish Alan Cumming to cameos by Meat Loaf etc. but it all just came off as fluff.The only good thing about the film were the catchy songs, which are now dated and sound very very banal!",1,3,7,20 June 2006
Troy," The acting saved the film...
","come one guys, you have to suspend your disbelief. It's an epic and even more so it's mythology, it is virtually impossible to make a flawless film about something whose history has so many legendary versions. I didn't dive into watching Troy expecting to learn the true history about the Trojan war, heck! I heard Brad Pitt was naked in it and so I rented it (vain as that may sound LOL! it's the doggone truth).Moving along, I give the director (and perhaps the writer) major credit for keeping it all straight forward (unlike what what's his face did with Alexander --which by the way is a whole other review). Here's the story without any brain science involved (even a cave man could get it right away, LOL! Okay way too many GEICO commercials HAHA!). Paris (a measly looking and way too pretty Orlando Bloom) falls in love with Helen of Sparta (played by Diane Krueger) too bad she is already married. Okay, let me wander off for a second. First things first, off all the men in the film, why does this woman choose the wimpiest looking one to have an affair with??? Therein lays my question. Second of all, while I'm not even going to front, Diane Krueger is pretty but of all the women of the world, how did they zero in on her to play Helen of Troy, a woman whose beauty legend tells us is second only to that of Aphrodite? I just couldn't get over that, much as I tried to suspend my disbelief. I mean, okay if worst came to the worst, they could have made the ethereal Rose Byrne play dual roles (Helen & Breseis). But you know, I'm just saying.Now back to the plot, one night during a liaison, Paris decides it would be a good idea to save Helen from her woeful marriage by bringing her back to Troy with him. On the boat, he confesses to his brother Hector (played by Eric Bana who turns in one of the finest performances in the film) that he has brought along Helen and immediately, through Hector's dismay and anger we see a foreshadowing of things to come. Since Troy and Sparta have endured a hot and cold relationship for years, it is small wonder that Helen's alleged abduction becomes more of a political issue than a personal one. Nevertheless, Helen is welcomed with open arms upon her arrival in Troy and through this ceremony we get to meet new characters including Breseis(Rose Byrne) the cousin of Paris & Hector, and Andromache(Saffron Burrows) the wife of Hector.Meanwhile back in Sparta, the king and his brother have begun to assemble the largest team of soldiers to embark on the journey to not only recover Helen but to attack Troy for the insult. They have one problem though, convincing mighty warrior Achilles(Brad Pitt in an Oscarworthy performance) to come along with them. Achilles, while a legendary warrior refuses to bow to the king nor subscribe to his unscrupulous ways but is somehow convinced to come along for the war because he knows that it will be a legendary one. Achilles arrives in Troy first and wreaks his havoc before the Spartan army and in doing so, his men are able to capture a woman priestess named Breseis with whom Achilles falls in love with and ultimately loses his life for.Look for great performances by Eric Bana, Brad Pitt and Rose Byrne. I'm sorry guys, I love Orly but I just couldn't suspend my disbelief long enough to believe anything he did in this film. Oh! and the nude scenes with Brad were so tastefully done that it was almost a let down that they didn't show us more. It's either that or I got the Walmart version(LOL!). Wolfgang Petersen handled the directing well, kudos to him and the actors did their parts, props to them. If only that script hadn't been a little too shaky for comfort. All in all, it was watchable.",8,7,14,17 December 2006
Don Jon," Like a mirror on what society shamelessly calls normal...
","The best part of this film (which was brilliantly written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt who stars as the titular character) is that it doesn't propose to solve any of the issues presented here it just highlights some particularly shameless norms of society. For example, a guy meets a girl at a club, buys her a drink and dances with her and by the end of the night it's customary that he gets to sleep with her. It is also customary to refer to women as bitches or whores and use foul language to compensate for little to non-existent vocabulary. All these are part of our social norms. Another example is; a guy who is addicted to watching pornography naturally would expect the women he encounters in real life to live up to that dolled up scripted reality as would a girl who is addicted to watching Hollywood romances where the leading actor does everything for the woman he loves, would expect the same from the real life men she encounters. Or perhaps the most daunting of examples could be seen in Jon's incessant worldly ways yet he goes to Church every Sunday to confess his sins only to go out into the world and do it all over again and the cycle continues. Except for a few editing issues, it's a very good commentary society's social cesspool with shining performances by Scarlett Johansson, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Julianne Moore.",7,0,0,25 March 2014
X-Men," X-static!
","This film was awesome! It's the first installment in a series of adaptations from the classic comics to bring the beloved comic heroes to life and the director achieves this with such cinematic kudos! The film begins with the character Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman) struggling to come to terms with what he truly is, but not for long we start getting introduced to the other characters as well, at least the ones who haven't checked themselves into the Xavier school for the gifted yet. We are introduced to a young Rogue (played by Anna Paquin) who is so frightened by her special powers and what it does to the people around her that she runs away from home. Sooner than later, she meets up with Wolverine (actually she hides in the back of his truck) and he inadvertently allows her to tag along with him. The chemistry between the two is blazing but weird since Anna is so young and Hugh is very much older. Along the way, they are attacked by Sabretooth and now know that it is imperative that they find the Xavier school which they eventually do. While there the meet a slew of gifted X-men and team up with Professor Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) to help stop the evil Magnetto (Played by Sir Ian Mckellen).",10,4,6,13 March 2006
Match Point," Great cinematographically but that's about it! the script is the pits!
","Okay, this was my first Woody Allen film. I have been avoiding this man like a bad rash all my life because he just rubs me the wrong way but after all the hoopla surrounding the casting of this film (the Kate Winslet razzmatazz), I just had to go see it when it was finally shot with Scarlett Johnassen in the Nola Rice role, in place of Winslet. In case you were wondering the reason for this otherwise senseless paragraph, Winslet's my favourite actress.Okay, the premise is as follows. A young Irish man named Chris (played by Johnathan Rhys Myers) comes to England and is quickly accepted into an exclusively unique clique of rich socialites with whom he begins to have an affair with one. He is invited to come an spend sometime on the estate of the father of two of his friends (one of whom is his lover) where he meets the stunning American fiancée of his friend, a woman named Nola Rice, played to perfection by Scarlett Johanssen. Chris cannot take his eyes of her from the moment he spots her and his reactions to this great beauty impact what happens throughout the course of the rest of the film. OKAY STOP READING HERE IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED IN MY RANTINGS WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT CONTAIN WHAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ***SPOILERS!!!***If there is one thing I took away from it all, it's NOT TO GET KILLED IN THE UK!!!!!! I mean, maybe it's because I live in NYC now or whatever but, what sort of police department just takes the word of a potential suspect for it like that???? no matter how rich he/she may be!!!! 1. No autopsy was conducted on Nola or the fetus? 2. They didn't even dust either of the flats for DNA residue or prints? 3. The ring wasn't the only thing missing from the old woman's flat, why just because you found a ring on a dead drug dealer would you automatically close a case and not try and use that lead to sniff out the rest of the missing items? 4. No eyewitness reports except for the neighbour who saw Nola minutes before her demise? That couldn't have happened here in NYC! At least 20 people would have seen something, including people who weren't even there!!!!! Besides, that street looked like it housed a lot of nosy type neighbours, how is it that nobody saw Chris (an out of place socialite looking man) enter or leave the building on the day of the murders, as well as the many times he came there to see Nola? 5. As curious and as nosy as Chris's wife was, she never once caught her husband going down to the cellar to steal or replace the shotgun?6. The police didn't even bother to check phone records? 7. What about Nola's co-worker? Nobody even bothered to go interview her, and she obviously knew about the affair and pregnancy.8. With a gun as loud as that, you just have to wonder how nobody heard it go off twice is such a stuffy looking neighbourhood and not to mention the building itself. + look how long Chris had to wait for Nola to come home!!!! 9. The neighbour knocks for so long on the old lady's door but never once thinks to call the cops to tell them that it's unusual for her not to answer her door? Somebody who barely leaves the house. And how that loser was upstairs the whole time the old lady was getting killed and did not hear anything is just totally and universally beyond me!!!! 10. Don't even get me started about the diary and its contents. 11. The crime was so sloppy, that even a high school Forensic-Files-Nancy-Drew-wannabe-team of students could have solved it, yet the entire police department for that city couldn't? 12. The maid must have seen something, yet she said nothing.",6,3,5,19 June 2006
The Prestige," This one frustrated me
","one of my sister's actually said that it was probably because I love Hugh Jackman so much that I couldn't bear to see him in such an obsessive state but I beg to differ. It was well shot, very imaginative and the actors were at the top of their game, I just really didn't like this film. The Prestige and The Illusionist both arrived at the box-office within months or maybe even weeks apart from one another and sort of K-Oed each other with their similar look and plot lines. I went to see The Prestige, thinking it would be the better movie because it seemed to have the better cast but I can confirm now that this was not the case. The tale within The Prestige dealt more with obsession, revenge and the darker side of the art of magic whereas The Illusionist dealt with romance, illusions and perhaps sweet revenge or shall I say karma.Anyways, since I'm reviewing The Prestige let me keep it at that. The film revolves around two rivaling magicians: Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (played by Christian Bale). Upon the suspiciously accidental death Angier's wife Julia (played oddly by Piper Perabo) the tension between the two magicians not only intensifies (seeing how Borden was supposedly the one who tied the knot to the rope that killed Julia) it becomes a flat out tug-of-war. With Angier trying to find answers as to why his wife was killed and with Borden trying to avoid being murdered by his rival. Scarlett Johansson's Olivia shows up later to play the mediator between the two men but to no apparent avail. With either of the other trying to outdo the other with the latest magic tricks, the competition eventually turns into a fatally dangerous obsession.

Crash," Thought provoking and very in-your-face!
","You have to be prepared to watch a film like this. Unless you have no emotions, no real sense of self, and you have been isolated from popular culture. Please keep in mind that this is a young person's point of view. I came away from this film thinking two things: 1) that we as human beings are all racists in some way or form no matter if we admit it or not. 2) Art imitates life and vice versa. I am not disputing the fact that this is an excellent piece of work by Director Paul Haggis, it's just that I was not prepared for the harrowing saga that is the movie Crash. It does not pretend, it doesn't not solve anything, it does not point fingers, you look at it and you can see yourself in it, no matter what age, race, religion you are, unless you're a new born baby. It is an American film, or at least most identifiably American. The values in this film are those that we have been taught, and those that we have grabbed and assimilated along the way. The saddest part of this film, to me is that it seems to be saying that we as human beings and citizens of this earth concern ourselves mostly with the trivial things in life, and that in itself is our own downfall.",10,2,9,22 February 2006
Closer," What happens when a potential 4some orgy becomes a relationship!
","I didn't like this film. It was a very good film, but I didn't like it. Maybe as I grow older and I re-watch it in, I will understand it better and like but for now, I saw it and it was borderline silly. The film takes place in London, England. Julia Roberts plays a famous photographer who is with Clive Owen's character but their relationship is forever altered when she meets Jude Law's character and begins to sleep with him. Jude law's character is, by the way, with a new American import by way of Natalie Portman in her Oscar nominated role. Add in a few sexual situations, tons of bad language and innuendos, Natalie Portman wearing a pink wing and working as stripper whom Clive Owen's character comes on to and you've pretty much got the much hyped movie Closer.",7,0,0,27 March 2006
Shutter Island," Mind Blasting!!!
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film but I am still going to go out and get the book (God willing). So much was left out of the film it seems, I'm sure Mr. Martin Scorcese expects his audience to be an intelligent one who is adept at putting two and two together but I just need to know that I am make the right conclusions because it was a little confusing especially with the way the film ended. I know Scorcese left it open for a reason which makes all the more brilliant but I suspect the book would lean more toward one direction than the other instead of remaining neutral like the film. I gave it a 9/10 because of the opening ending, I would have rather seen several alternative endings included on the DVD but now I'm going to have to read the book to get my resolution.",9,0,2,19 July 2010
American Hustle," One of the worst films if not the worst film I have ever seen
","TEN Oscar NOMINATIONS????? Really???? How???? Honestly, if I didn't have as much respect for the Academy awards I would entertain the thought that it is possible to buy nominations if not awards from Hollywood's most prestigious and coveted accolade institution. Everything about 'American Hustle' is bad and over-the-top, even actors/actresses who you know are good are made to look like caricatures of themselves in this self-indulgent-excessive-acid-trip- hot-mess of a film. The only character worth mentioning (who did not over play her part) -- is played by Elisabeth Rohm -- who is given such little screen time that is does not even begin to put dent into making this train wreck at least tolerable. Avoid at all cost.",1,4,6,15 October 2014
Man of Steel," Brilliant but underwhelming...
","I can see that a lot of effort was put into the making of the film and the cast was great but I couldn't help feeling bored at times and unenlightened. So many scenes looked like they were blatantly copied from other films, even some dialogue seemed copies as well especially when it came to the action scenes and sequences (which is something that I've come to expect and notice from almost every Hollywood blockbuster type flick nowadays) the only impressive action scenes were the stunts done by the characters played by Russell Crowe and Antje Traue and it should be noted that these two were hardly even in the nearly three-hour-long film. In a film like this, the spectacular scenes should be shown off of the main characters not the supporting or hardly present ones. The conflict between Jor-el (Crowe) and Zod (Michael Shannon) formed the basis of the film, which was good and later on Kal (Henry Cavill) realising and carrying on his father's legacy was solid and portrayed well. The relationship between Lois and Kal shamefully was not. So much of it was clichéd and very predictable but I'm still giving the film an 8/10 because I truly appreciate the effort they put into breathing new life to the superman saga but I'm not going to lie, I expected more.",8,1,2,7 April 2014
The Village," I love M Knight because he never fails to bring it!
","This is a film that you have to separate yourself from the naysayers and the hype to watch. It will knock your socks off! I watched this film out of the goodness of my heart and my love for the director. I ignored reviews and synopsis, my ticket was bought based on M Knight's past accomplishments with films like Signs and The sixth sense. Needless to say, I love the way his films make me think and not to mention that ever present scare factor. But enough about my praises for MKS. The Village, starring Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody among others is two stories in one. The story of life one some know it and life as they have made it known to others. That's the basis of the movie, everything else is an explanation of why certain things happened the way they did etc. etc. When you see the film or if you have already seen it, my afore statements will make a lot of sense to you. Anyhow, the story takes place in the dark ages and we come to know the characters are terrified by creatures that live in a nearby forest that come in to town to terrorise and kill once their territory has been breached. Within all this chaos, two major love stories manage to exist; one between Phoenix's character and a blind childhood friend whose sister he had to rebuff, and the other (however unrequited) between Sigourney Weaver's character and the blind girl's father. Something horrific happens that forces Phoenix's lady love to venture into uncharted and unwelcome territory and the result of her journey reveals the shocking plot twist that will knock your socks off!",10,0,2,21 April 2006
21," Suspense & Drama
","A bunch of brilliant Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) students are trained by a professor with seemingly insidious agendas on the art of card counting in the hopes of beating the age old slogan 'The house always wins' by using mathematics and skill to throw games at the biggest casinos in Las Vegas and taking those high rolling money magnets for all they are worth. Each student on the team must be clever enough to hold their card counting position on the team, discrete enough to keep their craft a secret and desperate enough for funds not to want to leave the team high and dry in case they suddenly develop (ed) a conscience.

Split," Paisa Vasool!
","'Paisa Vasool' (Hindi expression often used by satisfied moviegoers exiting the theatre) means 'Money's Worth' and that's what you can expect to get from watching 'Split.' James McAvoy gives one of his career's best performance(s) and his director M. Night finally redeems himself with a much deserved and long awaited blockbuster comeback from a career slump following a string of poorly conceived & received box office under performers (The Happening, The Last Airbender, The Lady in the Water & After Earth). Finally, M. Night has returned to the beast mode he was in when he gave us (The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village & Unbreakable) and you dare not leave your brain at home for this one because there is a lot of thinking, comparing & remembering required. Special props to the attention paid to stereotypes in this film, the embodiment of those clearly defined roles and filling them was impeccable & quite remarkable. If you loved 'Identity' & 'Unbreakable' you will love 'Split.'",8,5,16,6 March 2017
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Packs some serious heat!
","This is my favourite of the trilogy (of course part 1 is the undisputed classic and part 2 was just way too scary and off target for me), but I like the fact that they used a woman this time to portray that indestructible killing machine hellbent on annihilating John and Sarah Connor. Half the job is already complete by the time Kristiana Loken takes over the task but she still manages to kick some major butt and do some amazing stunts in her or shall I say (its) pursuit of John (played now by Nick Stahl) and his unwilling tag along girlfriend (played by Claire Danes). Naturally, an aging Arnold is back as the bad guy turned good guy hell bent on protecting John come what may and he does a pretty neat job. This film is worth seeing at least once or as part of the three film marathon.",8,1,3,11 July 2006
Dreamgirls," WOW! ten times over! A++++++++
","Okay maybe by the time I've seen Dreamgirls 1000 times, I will begin to notice the faults then recall this review but right now, it's flawless to me. Don't get me wrong, trust me, I waited long enough to see it, I had been the #1 in line to deem it 'an over-hyped Beyonce commercial' and over-praised but then I saw it and wow! I take back all my preconceived notions and instead tip my hat to everyone involved with this masterpiece. Take a bow, you all deserve it.Now the part about the whole 'overhyped Beyonce commercials' does actually exist in the film but I'll explain that later in my review. Besides, what else can you expect when Beyonce's mirroring Diana Ross in the role? Anyhow, the film begins with a talent competition not unlike American Idol -- a bunch of talented people come together to perform before judges and at the end of the day, the oddest ball performer is chosen as the winner. But don't cry yet, the Dreamettes (played spectacularly by Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson, & Anika Noni Rose) who lost out in the talent competition are quickly snagged up backstage by a talent scout, Curtis (played by Jamie Foxx), who hires them on the spot to come and sing back-up for a hot act by way of Eddie Murphy who plays a heroine addicted singer named Jimmy. The starry eyed girls all agree and go along with him although only after some initial hesitation on the part of Effie White (Jennifer Hudson) the most fiery of all three girls. Thus, begins the dream that is the Dreamettes. But as you would imagine or might have pieced together from the promos hinting at the whole Diana Ross and the Supremes nature of the storyline, it isn't too long before the heavyset and self-assured egotistical beauty, Effie is sidelined and replaced as lead-singer by Deena Jones (Beyonce Knowles) and her more conventional looks and voice. This does not sit well with Effie as right before her eyes her dreams are snatched away from her, as is her man as well as her friends and everything else she held dear. Right at the brink of the Dreamettes's super stardom, Effie is cut from the group, pregnant, sick, cold and alone.Now in a Bollywood musical, the ending of that last paragraph would have led into an intermission but this being Hollywood, we are only allowed a two-second breather before the movie continues and we see Deena in the future all rich and established viewing footage of her past accomplishments and doctored memories -- specifically tailored to exclude all images of Effie. This is where the Beyonce commercial begins, as at this point in her character's life, she looks very much like, well the Beyonce Knowles the world knows and loves. And if that is not enough for you, then Jamie Foxx's Curtis adds audio to the commercial by telling his beloved wife in 'The first time I saw you' all while all sorts of supermodel shots and over-sized photos and posters of Beyonce um, I mean...Deena are being saturated on the viewer. Okay, before this begins to sound like an attack on Beyonce, let me stop. There's more, but let me stop. LOL! + IMDb is telling me that I've written enough by forcing me to go and chop down portions of my review that has become over-limit so let me just end with this: Most memorable moments in the film: Beyonce: Singing 'Listen' Jennifer: Singing 'And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going' Anika: Leaving Eddie's character Eddie: Dying Jamie: Acknowledging his daughter Danny Glover: Just being there Sharon Leal: Being third fiddle Keith Robinson: The scene with Effie @ the wake with Loretta Devine",10,1,3,20 January 2007
Spirited Away," Stunning!
","There are already 532 reviews for this film. I am not surprised that so many people had so much to say about it, I'm just shocked that they even bothered to keep writing after so many comments had already been posted. I just saw it on the Cartoon Network and thought I'd add my thoughts and comments as well! Even though I'm sure nobody will sift through 533 comments to read this! It is quite simple, an AWESOME BRILLIANT VISUALLY STUNNING BEAUTIFUL LOVELY RARE UNIQUE SPECTACULAR FILM! It's a must see for anybody who appreciates good animated movies with vivid imaginations. This film won an Oscar for best animated feature and a slew of other international awards worldwide and all very well deserved too.",10,3,6,3 February 2006
No Strings Attached," Maybe I've Seen Way Too Much of Natalie Portman Recently...
","I could barely get into the movie, let alone sit through it because I had a hard time buying Natalie Portman as the character she was playing. She's such an annoying over-achiever (and people rag on Kate Winslet for doing too much). Ashton Kutcher on his own was his usual self, not trying to out-act anyone or gun for an Oscar or anything. That coupled with the fact that this film seemed very similar to another terrible film I saw recently 'The Ugly Truth' starring Katherine Heigl and Gerald Butler. It's like we've run out of ideas and we're just coasting on the past ideas of others hoping something hits and works for the next set of coasters to come along and rehash our own copied ideas. The scary part is that this film was a hit people, so you can expect more like it coming to a theater near you sooner than you think. That said, I think Katherine Heigl should have played this role instead of Natalie Portman.",4,10,12,20 September 2011
Dirty Dancing," Predictable!
","It might have been groundbreaking in its day but watching this movie in this day and age, everything seems so predictable. Patrick Swayze plays a dance teacher who comes into the lives of a holiday camping family when their youngest daughter falls in love with him. The daughter (a young lady referred to as Baby) becomes a woman during this course of this trip, as well as discovers parts of herself that she never knew existed when she takes the place of the indisposed dancing partner of Swayze's character. It's not a musical although there are very many recognisable tunes and numbers within the film because of its heavy dancing. The film, which is centered around coming-of-age and dancing also deals with abortion and jealousy.",8,0,0,21 May 2006
Batman Begins," 206+ pages of great reviews for this film can't be wrong!
","Wow! I was blown away by this one. It's almost like somebody dared them to bring it after seeing the previous installments of the series of movies under this franchise, and they sure as heck brought it! With an Oscar-winning, Oscar-nominated cast that included the likes of: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe and Morgan Freeman you wouldn't expect any less but don't be fooled by that because the manner in which this installment was chock full of who's who names, so were the arguably disastrous 'Batman and Robin, Forever & Returns) sequels to the finer classic 'Batman.' Luckily, the writers backed up all that talent with a good story in its script and incredibly witty Dialogue. Batman Begins starts off with Bruce Wayne as a little boy, playing around with childhood friend Rachel Dawes when during hide and seek he falls down an old well shaft and is attacked by a nest of bats which frighten the heck out of him. He is rescued and nursed back to health by his parents who then treat him to a Broadway play days later. During the play, young Bruce is frightened by the thematic elements and his parents decide to ditch the show early. They leave through an alleyway where they are attacked by a homeless druggie, who upon obtaining the Wayne's wallet, shoots both parents dead. The film then picks up about 15 years later where Bruce(now played by Christian Bale) travels the world in search of ways to get rid of injustice (basically what his parents were fighting for) as well as get revenge. He meets two Samurais (played by Ken Watanabe and Liam Neeson) who train him in weird but efficient ways to face his fears and conquer his enemies. He returns to Gotham city to attend the hearing of the man who killed his parents and there he meets Rachel Dawes(now played by Katie Holmes) who is the assistant district attorney, naturally sparks fly and he is instantly smitten with her from the moment he sees her all grown up. Bruce had come prepared to shoot the killer dead when he stepped out of the courthouse, but somebody beats him to it and he finds out the set up. This leads him to go and confront the drug-lord (played by Tom Wilkinson) the killer work for and the meeting infuriates him. It is this and more that slowly turns Bruce into his alter-ego Batman and there is never a dull moment as he comes to terms with occurrences around him, his true enemies become revealed and he comes to terms with his fears. What with the intense action sequences, the high tech equipment and visuals and not to mention CGI! If you haven't seen any of the other Batman films, skip them and see Batman Begins first! You won't be sorry.",10,3,5,13 March 2006
Insidious," One of the scariest if not the scariest film I've seen in a very long time.
","After a series of initial paranormal occurrences in the home of a seemingly regular family, a child goes to sleep but forgets to wake up and after the unraveling of a dark family secret his father must enter a purgatory-like dream world called 'the further' to remind his son to wake up, all while battling 'insidious' entities that are trying to make it back into their bodies before they do. Exceptional acting by all, including the children.One of the best and perhaps the scariest thing about this movie is that it did not go the obvious route of gory spectacle, blood spilling, suggestive innuendo, profanity laced, obnoxious characters screaming their way through the majority of the film only to get killed at or towards the end and whatever other nonsense is typical of so-called 'scary' or 'horror' movies made nowadays. Instead the writer (and director) employ simple things like 'familiarity' and 'psychological terror' that would unnerve even the most tough to ruffle among us... if it could happen to them if you happen to you right? Their lives seems so routine and so safe how could such horror possibly happen to such a lovely family?",9,0,1,13 January 2014
Ghost Rider," A Hater's Worst Nightmare...Because it is so GOOD!
","Let me start with this, nobody looks like themselves in this movie, that I was initially stuck doing double takes before I could settle into the storyline. Peter Fonda playing Mephistopheles looked much like Jack Nicholson to me, Wes Bentley playing Blackheart looked very much like Joaquin Phoenix to me, plus it was so obvious that makeup was what was used to achieve the similarities between the young Roxanne Simpson & Johnny Blaze and the older ones but don't even get me started on how much Eva Mendes playing Roxanne Simpson looked and acted very much like an Uber bimbo version Jessica Simpson. Ugh!Anywho, the films begin with the audience being clued in on the legend of the ghost rider, specifically the one who out ran the devil while unwilling to deliver a contract of tortured souls. Then the storyline fast forwards to the future and we are introduced to the love story between teenagers Johnny Blaze (played by Matt Long) and Roxanne Simpson (Raquel Alessi). Both of their fathers are against the relationship, with the former thinking that his daughter is too good for Johnny and the latter thinking that his son should forget what he terms a fleeting affair. But the teenagers are in love and decide to run away together the following day. That night, while Johnny is tidying up he finds a letter in the dustbin that reveals his father, Barton Blaze (played by Brett Cullen) has cancer. This upsets him and he decides go out and work off his energy on repairing his bike, he is doing this when a man (who turns out to be Mephistopheles) appears out of no where and begins to talk to him about his father's condition. Young Johnny is intrigued and inadvertently winds up signing his soul to the devil in exchange for his father's health. The next day, when he sees his father all hale and hearty, he realises that the night before hadn't been a dream but the reality really hits him when his father dies hours later and he (Johnny) is revisited by Mephistopheles who clues him in on what is to come. In rage, Johnny ditches Roxanne and runs away on his own and this is where Nicolas Cage's character takes over. In present day, Johnny Blaze is a very famous stuntman with a dark secret that hunts him every waking moment. Roxannne Simpson (now played by Eva Mendes doing a very bad spoof of Jessica Simpson) waltzes her way back into his life when he least expects it, as does Mephistopheles to stake his claim. Now Blaze has his hands full battling his feelings for Roxanne, his disgust for Mephistopheles and not the mention the legion of demons that accompany Mephistopheles's son and nemesis Blackheart (played by Wes Bentley). Donal Logue co-stars Blaze's best-friend and manager.Watch it for the spectacular special effects, funny lines/comic relief, Cage's witty GR and Bentley's show-stopping Blackheart. I, for one doubted how they were going to bring the awesome comic book anti-hero to life but they made good on their promise to wow! us if you asked me. Only two things annoyed me in the entire film, Eve Mendes's Roxanne and the Old Ghost Rider (most of his lines were very lame) and his secret wasn't that much of a secret to me or much of the audience for that matter. That said, it's still pure entertainment, nothing more nothing less, I don't understand why people are acting as if this is the war in Iraq we're talking about here. If this film is not good enough entertainment or adaptation for you, then do us all a favour and make your own adaptation.",8,4,9,24 February 2007
The Mist," I am still in SHOCK from watching this movie....
","The acting was sub-par (except for Marcia Gay Harden and Sam Witwer) both who play religious fanatic and military man respectively and very well might I add. The premise of the film itself centers around a mist that forms over a small town carrying creatures from another world that begin to annihilate the residents. A small group of survivors are trapped in the local grocery store and in there they try to wait out the freak storm that has enveloped their town but slowly and surely with all civility out the window, they all begin to turn against one another.LOOK UP horror movie in the dictionary and you would probably find a poster of this film. It is horrific in every way imaginably. It is even horrific without the intention of being that horrific. I am still in shock by the ending. I cried for days. I just can't get over this film.",1,10,20,27 September 2009
Moulin Rouge!," Hollywood's Devdas!
","Gosh! I loved that Ewan and Niccy did their own singing and dancing in this. I just love reality and musicals! Especially reality in musicals. Anywho, for those of your not familiar with the tale of Devdas that I mentioned in my summary, well, Devdas is a sort of Bengali Indian story of Romeo and Juliet but it's completely original because it draws from true life. Boy and girl love each other but are driven apart by forces within their surroundings. Moulin Rouge is sort of like it as well, with the all star cast to boot. I mean, we're talking stellar director Baz Luhrman, actors Nicole Kidman, Ewan Mcgregor, Jim Broadbent, John Leguiziamo, singer Kylie Minogue among others. The film, about two star crossed lovers is as lush and as lavish as any epic Bollywood piece. Don't miss the stirring ballad 'Come what may' sung by Kidman and Mcgregor, and that infectious Lady Marmalade end credits/Grammy winning soundtrack song that caused the likes of Christina Aguilera, Mya, Little Kim, and Pink to come together for that party! Kidman is the most famous Moulin Rouge performer and Mcgregor is the writer who falls for her, too bad the theatre funder who Kidman is being forced to pretend she is interested in also has plans for her. Match that with tuberculosis in a day and age where it was untreatable and you know this can't end well. One of my sister's actually thought that all that coughing from Kidman's character was a result of her corset being too tight. LOL! Nice movie though, one of my favourites.",8,5,7,21 April 2006
The Illusionist," I agree with almost everyone...
","it was quite suspenseful and beautifully shot but I figured out the plot twist from the moment the illusionist(played by Edward Norton) enlightened the crown Prince (played by the always delightfully sinister Rufus Sewell) with the 'soul lives on' trick. Maybe it's because I had seen The Prestige before this, I don't know but I figured out the ending way ahead of time and that kind of ruined the rest of it all for me. The story within the film is that of a young man with the talent for magic, who falls in love with a beautiful countess(Jessica Biel) and the obstacles they face with their star-crossed love. One of the best performances in the film, comes from Paul Giametti who plays a police inspector whom at the bequest of the crown Prince is hot on the tail of the Illusionist. His job is to try and discredit the young magician and defame him because he is not only a rival to the prince but is also able to command such a strong attention of the country's people (something the crown prince is wary of). When the death of Sophie(Biel) rouses suspicion, a game of cat and mouse ensues in the quest to figure out whether the illusionist can reveal her killer. But be mindful of everything you see during the course of the film, as a key clue to the ending plays out within thirty minutes into the film.",8,0,0,30 April 2007
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Gosh there are already 57 pages of reviews!
","I needn't add mine despite all of that but I will. Having caught only the ending of part one, I relied mainly on my imagination of the video game (and Resident Evil is one of my all time favourites) to guess what had occurred up until that point. Then came part two, which sort of recapped a bit of the part one so I was able to catch up. I was feeling too lazy to rent part one in essence. Anyways, part two begins with Alice being trapped inside a lab and being studied after most of her friends and confidants had been killed off in part one. They are not only studying her, they are building her up to be this sort of super soldier without her knowledge. After a few guards and scientists are killed off in the beginning during a botched mission to go study new phenomena, there's a security breech and Alice awakes from her coma. She quickly overpowers everyone around her and begins to try and escape. She is quick to realise that the undead have overpowered Raccoon city but that's the least of her problems. She soon realises that she will have to battle the evil Nemesis (which I have to admit is not half as scary as he appears in the games). She teams up with a few survivors (which include yummy Mummmy alum Oded Fehr playing one part of a team of soldiers sent to retrieve the trapped daughter of a prominent scientist, and an unrecognisable Sienna Guillory as the major Arse kicking Jill Valentine) who are trying to make their way to the Barrier city. It's En Route there that they encounter Nemesis 'Stars! Stars!' who is hot on their tail.",8,1,2,8 April 2006
Prisoners," Almost perfect gripping drama
","Every parent's worst nightmare is losing a child in any possible way that it might happen. Here, Hugh Jackman, Elizabeth Banks, Terence Howard and Viola Davis play two pair of parents whose youngest children vanish during a thanksgiving get-together. Each pair's eldest kids then tell their parents and detectives that they have spotted a camper parked outside earlier and that their siblings tried to play on it but they stopped them and thus begins a statewide search for the two best friends. The horrific emotional toll of the two missing children pushes each parent to the brink of insanity as they stop at nothing to make sure that their children are found alive. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the lead detective hell bent on bringing the children home and his painstaking investigation as well as Jackman's vigilantism help unravel the small town's deepest darkest secrets and changes all their lives forever. At 153 minutes, you will feel the length of this film but it is with due cause that it is that long. Melissa Leo rounds out the cast of stellar performers.",9,1,2,27 March 2014
The Dark Knight," What dreams are made of...
","Okay, so I am not a big fan of the comic books, I've caught the cartoons on telly a few times and I did watch all the other Batman 'Hollywood' flicks so far but nothing comes close to achieving such cinematic excellence as the Dark Knight does. I thought Batman Begins was good and it's rare for a sequel to ever surpass its predecessor but in this case it does. The script was great, the acting was on point, especially with the late great Heath Ledger as the demented joker and might I add that his Oscar winning performance was so riveting and so haunting that it gave me nightmares. It was truly a role of a lifetime for him and he did the role justice. Christian Bale (another fine actor) has relaxed into the armor and latex as the tormented Batman and yes his kicks some major derrière here. I wasn't too sure about the replacement of Katie Holmes (Rachel) but Maggie Gyllehaal gave her essaying of the role such a twist that it's hard to decide if she was good or bad. All in all, it does not matter because the great script was there to support any character who dared falter in this action packed, take-no-names thriller adventure. A++++",10,1,9,29 March 2009
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The Most Celebrated Film of 2004 and Rightfully So!
","Stellar! Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey compliment each other as Clem and Joel, a couple who have a falling out after which the former decides to go have a procedure that would erase virtually every memory of the latter from her existence. Joel (Carrey), thinking that Clem (Winslet) has undergone the procedure is stark, raving, mad at her and decides to go have the same thing done himself. The catch is that Clem didn't actually erase the memories, she was planning to until she changed her mind, but Joel doesn't know this until after the procedure has already been started on him. Things get pretty wacky, funny, and whimsical from here on in the plot. Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Tom Wilkinson round out the superb supporting cast! A must see if you haven't seen it. Winslet received her 4th Oscar nomination for her role as Clementine Kruzensky. This film is also a part of my DVD collection.",10,2,6,6 March 2006

Thor," Thoroughly entertaining
","I can't say I was a fan of the superhero and his comics before the film, in fact I actually decided to watch this based on the cast (most of whom I am a fan of) and what a pleasant surprise it turned out to be. So the story begins with scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her crew conducting research in the middle of the desert of New Mexico when their equipment registers a strange astronomical anomaly. They race towards its ground zero to investigate, then suddenly out of nowhere a man appears and is hit by their vehicle. They team stops to see what they hit as soon as they see it's what looks like a man they quickly bundle him up into their vehicle and head for the hospital. Meanwhile, stranger things begin to happen all around them and it isn't long before they discover that their new companion is not of this earth.

","and that's about it. In this film that ended a thousand relationships, and began several! Brangelina star as a husband and wife team of assassins who don't know each other's true identity. One day, the new assignment is for them to eliminate each other, and they soon realise that the sooner they come to terms with the set up the better it is for them as they unite as a team to overcome their adversaries. But first they have to figure out if they truly love each other and why did they indeed get married. This is just an action packed adventure that capitalises on the relationship of Brangelina with utmost success, unlike Ben and J-lo in Gigli. It's sexy, it's fun, it's funny, it's intense, it's witty, action packed and kicks some major butt! A must see for anyone who genuinely loves Brad or Angelina.",7,0,2,13 March 2006
The Holiday," Even with Kate Winslet whom I absolutely love, it was annoying!
","Okay, there were just to many plot holes (would Graham's daughters actually have individual cellphones at that age? Would their aunt Iris never had visited the inside of their tent? How was the car able to return to the house to pick Amanda up when it couldn't drop her off there in the first place? Just to mention a few), too many factual errors(Cary Grant was from Bristol not Surrey, would Iris have actually told Jasper she was going on vacation? When indeed us Brits say Holiday? Amanda running in the snow with her high heels??? just to mention a few) and to add to all of that Cameron Diaz was in it. Ugh! She was so annoying! As were all her scenes. I don't know why the director even cast her in this, she totally ruined an otherwise passable film.The plot revolves two women Iris(Kate Winslet) and Amanda(a hyperactive Cameron Diaz), the former has just be jilted by her long-time mostly unrequited love Jasper (played by Winslet's one time real life boyfriend Rufus Sewell) and the latter was cheated on by her live in love (played by Ed Burns). A suicidal Iris decides that rather than killing herself, she might as well put her house up for a home swap and go wherever the lucky swapper swaps with her. Amanda, throws her cheating lover out, goes online to search for an attractive vacation packet and finds Iris's English cottage which instantly attracts her. She gets in touch with Iris and through a series of instant messages, they agree to swap houses. Iris will go to Amanda's mansion in Los Angeles and Amanda would get to go to Iris's English home in Surrey. Upon arriving in America, Iris is mesmerised by the entire atmosphere of Los Angeles and is shocked to find out that she has swapped lives with a very famous and not to mention rich woman. Amanda on the other hand is devastated when she arrives in the murky village where Iris's cottage is located and has quite an adventure getting there to begin with. The two women then begin to make the most of the two-week life swap they have just embarked on. In the process, Amanda meets Iris's brother Graham and falls in love with him, while Iris meets Amanda's co-worker Miles(played by Jack Black) with whom she falls in love. But all of this is not without trials and tribulations. Eli Wallach co-stars as the delightful Arthur, Amanda's neighbour whom Iris forges a strong friendship with.Perhaps most odd are the cameos by Lindsay Lohan and James Franco as action heroes in a movie within the movie. Blink and you'll miss a cameo by Dustin Hoffman too. Generally, this film would seriously have been cool had it not been for Cameron Diaz's over-confidence and obnoxiousness.",7,0,1,1 May 2007
Zero Dark Thirty," Get Off Your High Horses, It Was Bloody Good!!
","People keep talking about how slow paced the movie was and that just makes me want to throw my hands up in the air because it's so ironic, I mean did we watch the same film? Did you not see how many days it took to actually capture and kill Bin Laden from the time the compound was discovered? Jessica Chastain's character kept writing it on the glass wall!!!! Duh, the process was painstakingly slow-moving and that's exactly what the movie depicts.That said, if there ever was a movie to drop the 'f' bomb every five seconds it's this one. This is not for the faint-hearted, counter- terrorism is as serious as....it rhymes with muck and Kathryn Bigelow did a fantastic job bringing the story of the capture and killing of Osama Bin Landen to the big screen. She really excels at capturing the perilous drama and intensely gripping emotions involved in wartime action dramas. Chastain is a force in the fast-track lane of establishing herself as one of the finest actresses of the 21st century, it is hard to believe that she has come so far in such a short career span (thus far at least) but I guess that is testament to how truly talented she really is. She should have gotten an Oscar for this.",9,0,2,7 June 2013
War of the Worlds," A Weird mixture of Titanic, Aliens, ET, Psycho & a bunch of other classics!
","I like Steven Spielberg, I really do, but I feel he could have done better with the script especially seeing as it was a remake. He paid too much attention to the CGI stuff and whatever and seemed to have neglected this script. For instance, I'm sure I am not the only who missed the fact that the tripods et.AL. were defeated by bacteria. I thought that it was because Tom Cruise's (who plays the lead role, and a father of two in the film) character Ray took out the ring leader when he set off the grenade and therefore leading the rest of the aliens without command or what to do next. That's what I honestly thought until I watched the extra features on the DVD and found out that they were defeated by bacteria. Bacteria from what? The Blood slurpies? The film gets major +s for the scare factor, the action packed thrills and non-stop drama but as far as the script, it was weak.",6,0,1,28 February 2006
Love Actually," The Brits are trying to make a point...
","we pulled out all over top guns and then some and yet this fluff is all we could come up with. Like anybody would every believe a person like Kiera Knightley would marry a Black man. Portraying graphic sex in what should have been a family holiday movie? How classy! And those anti-American statements were just too tacky. While I don't know how true it is that an average American girl would have sex with the ugliest of Brits just because of his accent, I just found the Bill Bob Thorton president scene to be a bit much. Yeah, so Americans have stereotyped Brits for years as the villains in their films. That's not actually a stereotype y'know? You do the math. Anways, let's talk about the film if you care for my review. That stuck up Hugh Grant narrates how after 9/11 (yeah they're that tacky to use 9/11 to gain sentiments) people seem to understand that Love actually is all around us. Then the film proceeds to show all sorts of British relationships and how they all have their ups and downs. And they throw in a few Americans in negative roles just for affirmative action I guess. Who knows. The film stars Bill Nighy, Gregor Fisher, Rory MacGregor, Colin Firth, Sienna Guillory, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Lulu Popplewell, Kris Marshall, Heike Makatsch, Martin Freeman, Joanna Page, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Andrew Lincoln, Keira Knightley, Bill Bob Thorton, and Laura Linney just to mention a few. A few wise Brits like Rachel Weisz and Catherine Zeta Jones wisely avoided this canker-worm of a film like a bad rash. They couldn't get Kate Winslet (that wise darling) to come her waste her two cents in it, so they stole a scene from Titanic and put it in the film. Yes, they are that tacky! I could sit here and list everything that's wrong with this pretentious overblown, over praised and overzealous film but y'know what? I'll rather go punch a wall.",2,2,3,8 April 2006
Wedding Crashers," As long and as crappy as the worst of Bollywood's lame excuse for a comedy!
","Oh where do I begin! Even Bollywood knows better than to churn out such garbage, so naturally I was surprised to see that this crap came from Hollywood! It was an irresponsible, desperate, demeaning, far-fetched, insane, pathetic, disgraceful, sick movie with one funny scene! I laughed only once! and that was for the scene when Todd actually turned out to be gay and he climbs into bed with Vince Vaughs character. That scene was the only funny one in the whole film to me! Did anybody notice how those losers didn't bother to crash any Black people's wedding? That's because Black people are smart and would have outs-ed those losers in their game the minute they walked in. They went to an Indian wedding and blended in, how bloody well far fetched! Hello! Bite me! I am so grateful I didn't pay a single dime to see this film, I saw it for free. And that cameo by Will Ferell as Chaz was just the crowning glory of horse-poop for the film! He was so unfunny, UN-charming, unrealistic and not to mention the mother of them all UNATTRACTIVE! Funeral crashing? How low can you go? I watched the uncorked version so naturally I am more upset than the people who watched the theatrical version who got to sit through less crap! I kept think these guys must be such desperate losers to have to go through so much trouble just to 'wham, bham, thank you m'am!' Oh and Christopher Walken needs to respect himself by cutting the slew of crappy films he has been appearing in lately, it's ruining his credibility. Only in Hollywood could the general populous of women be portrayed as such floozies and only in Hollywood could men like Owen Wilson and Vince Vaugh be considered hot enough to bang! Rachel Mcadams, the one star that I am giving this film is for you darling! You were a beautiful ring in the snout of such a pig of a crappy movie!",1,9,18,8 March 2006
Burlesque," Not what I was expecting...
","that said, I was expecting the film to be much better. It all seemed so mediocre (script, line delivery, acting, editing etc.) the only thing good about it was the music and now that I have seen it I am no longer upset that it wasn't nominated for the Oscars and other prestigious awards. It just wasn't up to par like CHICAGO, DREAM GIRLS, MOULIN ROUGE or even NINE. Christina Aguilera is the undisputed star of the entire cast and her vocals were flawless, in fact her singing carried the entire film which was otherwise boring and seemed to drag on after a while. I also liked Cher but just like Alan Cumming was hopelessly underused in a genre that they practically own. The guy who played Jack, Ali's(Christina Aguilera's character) love interest needs some serious acting lessons, he was painful to watch in this film, I think his being so self conscious in front of the camera made Christian nervous as well which made their scenes seem so forced, over-rehearsed and wooden. Watch this film only if you are a fan of Christina Aguilera or Cher.",5,0,1,29 May 2011
Man on Fire," Mind-blowing!
","There is very little Denzel Washington can do to shock us anymore at this point in his career but I was stunned by his performance in this film. He plays a former assassin eager to keep his past in the past as he slowly wastes away to booze and what not in Mexico. One day, his friend and former accomplice Rayburn (played by Christopher Walker) convinces him to take up a job as a bodyguard for a rich young couple's played by Radha Mitchell (in her element) and Marc Anthony (he continues to try and show us that he can do other things besides sing well) daughter Pita (played by the heartwarming/heartbreaking Dakota Fanning). Pita, a young girl of say seven-ish or tops ten-ish develops a school girl's crush on Creasy (Washington's character) and very soon she is able to melt his heart and create a worthy enough relationship with him that is enough to tug at his heart when she is eventually kidnapped and held for ransom. That's the first part of the film, and during the whole ordeal you will feel like you're actually watching Washington in two different films. Like a 2 for 1 so to speak. The second half of the film is spent on his ultimate revenge and bringing losers to justice. The problem with kidnapping in Mexico is one of the highlights of this film and it out to bring shame on the law makers and politicians of the country.",9,2,4,2 April 2006
Sherlock Holmes," Blink and you would miss something...
","This film is action-packed, fast paced and very well acted. The chemistry between Robert Downing Jr. and Jude Law was on point and their scenes just flowed effortlessly as a result of this. The visuals were awesome, especially during the fight sequences. Rachael McAdams was horribly miscast as the femme fatale but thankfully you would not pay too much attention to her struggling to keep up with the likes of exceptional actors within the film because they all cover for her inability to handle her scenes or accent properly. Hans Matheson is always a delight to watch (he does a supporting role in the film) and Guy Ritchie has proved yet again that nobody does action-drama (especially fight scenes) better than him.",8,0,2,20 April 2010
The Queen," Incredible
","After I saw this film, the first thing I did was log on to IMDb, seek out the title to check if Dame Helen Mirren won an Oscar for this role. She did. Phew. It would have been an atrocity if she did not. All is well with the world. That said, words cannot even begin to describe the level of an emotional roller coaster this film was. Mirren just swallows up every scene she's in that you just might find yourself doing a double-take to make sure that there wasn't a hidden camera placed in the British house of royals for us to spy on them Big Brother style. The film deals with a very dark period of the lives of the British royals...the death of princess Diana. It begins with rushes of her past life up until she begins dating Dodi Al Fayed, follows Prime Minister Tony Blair's election to office, streams through the last few hours of the princess's life, the royals reaction to her death, the public's reaction to the royals and how Tony Blair helps save them from themselves.",10,0,0,16 February 2014
Vanilla Sky," Poor copy
","The problem with this film is that it's a poor scene for scene copy of the far more superior 'Abre Los Ojos' (Open your eyes) the Spanish treatment. Something was lost in translation and all the artistic part of the superior film was sucked out by the casting of Tom Cruise as the protagonist and Cameron Diaz as well. Penelope Cruz tried her best but she was 100 times better in the original version. I tried to like this film but you're gonna have to forgive me because I watched 'Abre Los Ojos' two hours before I embarked on this horrendous journey known as 'Vanilla Sky.' Rent Abre Los Ojos (Open your Eyes) instead and save yourself from one more Hollywood crap-fest film. My apologies to Cameron Crowe(in case you ever stumble upon my comments), I actually like your other stuff.",2,1,2,2 June 2010
Iron Man," Don't over-analyze it you cynics!!! It was only a movie....a very very good movie!
","It was an awesome film, brilliant script, action-packed and brilliant cast. Why can't people just accept that? I don't understand all these naggers on here. I guess you just can't please everyone.Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark, a billionaire weapons engineer who is kidnapped (during a trip to Afghanistan) to showcase his latest weapon of enemy destruction. While in captivity, with the help of a kidnapped fellow machinist, Stark is able to build a robot (his first prototype for Iron Man) to enable him annihilate his oppressors and escape. Upon his successful mission and given his 3-month stint in a hell hole, Stark decides to re-assess his priorities by changing the image of his company. That does not sit well with his investors and board of directors and Stark's obstinacy only reveals and re-opens more cans of worms as the movie progresses. Gwyneth Paltrow is along for the ride as Pepper Potts, Stark's trusty assistant as is Terrence Howard who plays Stark's best-friend. Leslie Bibb also co-stars as a pesky reporter, all under the wonderful direction by Jon Favreau who does not miss a beat. Iron man is engaging, riveting and filled with the pulse pounding fun we've come to expect from bona-fide Hollywood blockbusters such as this one. A++++",10,0,1,29 March 2009
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Okay so...
","This was half and half for me. Half good half bad and I suppose that is much better than being totally bad like many Batman films before the Chris Nolan ones. Ben Affleck thankfully passed the test, Henry Cavill was his usual awesome self as Superman the second time around and the supporting characters were apt to their tasks especially Gal Gadot as Wonder-woman and let me just say that I am happy she is getting her own standalone film because with the amount of promise she showed in this film, she was NOT done justice with the small screen-time she was given here. The worst offender to me besides the shaky script was Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, I usually love him and I think he is a fantastic actor but he was horribly miscast in the role and I believe even he knew this because his approach was to try his best to ape the late great Heath Ledger's Joker and of course that act sank faster than the Titanic....at least with me.",7,1,1,9 August 2016
Identity," A psychological drama unlike any other....
","This is an edge-of-your seat thriller/drama that requires you to watch it attentively and be prepared to be stunned at its conclusion. It's the sort of film that you cannot just watch once. The ending will send you back nitpicking.The film revolves around the lives of 10 strangers who couldn't be more different from one another. They are all trapped in a shanty motel during a rainstorm that prevents anybody from leaving even with the threat of flooding looming within the next few hours. Sometime during the night, they begin to realise that they are being killed off one by one and it then becomes a survival of the fittest as nobody wants to be the next victim. The guys are bent on finding out who the killer is and the women just try to stay alive.Like I said before, the ending will shock you, so prepare yourself for this psychological blockbuster!",10,2,6,27 March 2006
X2: X-Men United," Blows X-men out of the water!
",The entire gang is back with a few more additions and surprises along the way. The story begins with an unforeseen force attacking and killing the mutants and Professor Xavier is trying to get to the bottom of it. He joins forces with Magneto who has escaped from plastic prison and together they agree to a truce and try to find the source of these violent crimes. This leads Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to discovers the identity of his creator as well as the secret of his past. The high technology of this one is even flashier and greater than the first and the characters are sexier and pumped up for action. Rebecca De Mornay shines more in her role this time around. A must see for all the comic book fans and lovers of the first installment.,10,0,1,13 March 2006
Thor: The Dark World," Good not great
","You can tell a lot of money was spent on this sequel to Thor (2011) but unfortunately as with tradition this sequel (like most sequels) does not live up to its original film and its sad because they had a very fleshy plot to play around with plus veritable villains to boot.First things first, this is either the first film or at least the first film in my recent memory that I've seen where the main villain was given so little to do. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) the secondary villain did his part and shined doing so but Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) king of the the dark elves was just wasted in his role in spite of him seeming so sinister and ruthlessly wicked in his introduction and initial scenes.Another footfall was the level of authenticity of Jane Foster's (Natalie Portman) possession, I mean she seemed possessed but if the great power within her was as strong as it was described by Odin (Anthony Hopkins) then it should have been shown to all but consume her and she should have been given some scenes in which she went over to the dark side and wreaked so much havoc. Sure she caused the death of Frigga (Rene Russo) but it wasn't an insidious act brought about by her possession. And speaking of Frigga, her funeral was one of the most beautiful send-offs ever captured on celluloid, just wish her sons would have mourned her properly and ruthlessly avenged her death. Darcy (Kat Dennings) Jane's trusty sidekick was her usual funny self but there was something off with her acting and even her humor at times. Kenneth Branagh really did a great job in directing her in part 1 where she was on her top game but unfortunately Alan Taylor was unable to capture the essence of this funny and witty character, instead he made her look hapless.Finally, for those who haven't seen 'Marvel's The Avengers' I suggest you do before watching this because there are so many references to the film during the course of 'Thor: The Dark World' that you might find yourself lost at times or at least wondering what they are on about. Though I will say that if you stayed for until the credits of 'Thor' finished rolling, you'll get a sense of why Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) is the way he is in this film.",7,0,0,8 May 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Even better than the first
","right from the opening scene of a disturbed Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) deep in thought as she looks out over a lake during a hunt, you can tell that not only have the makers of this follow-up to 'The Hunger Games' spent more money on its production but you are also in for a more compelling and thought provoking thrill of a ride and that is exactly what was delivered. We meet Katniss as she ponders about an upcoming tour of the districts as she struggles to cope with haunting effects of post traumatic stress disorder and recurring daydreams of those she was forced to kill in order to survive. Halfway through her tour, she breaks down under stress (and pressure from the president) inadvertently causing the death of an innocent with rippling effects that consequentially lead to the rules of the upcoming ' Hunger Games' to be bent in order to punish her and any/all of her sympathizers.",9,1,15,27 May 2014
Godzilla," If its intent was not insult the intelligence of the viewer...
","it could have been better but either the screenwriter or the film's director was just hellbent on treating the film's audience like we all have intellectual disabilities. The acting by the film's woefully underused albeit supremely talented cast (Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Elizabeth Olsen, Sally Hawkins) was solid and superb but unfortunately the moderately talented ones who were thrown to the forefront just did not measure up to what could have been. You already have a legendary main villain/monster(i.e. Godzilla) now throw in one or two other veritable sidekicks and the premise just sweetens on the page but the result is gross over-ambition rather cinematographic excellence. The simple premise of a monster laying dormant for many years feeding off of nuclear energy underground/underwater and finally emerging to terrorise the populous is made complex with unnecessary twists and turns and the pointless need to show off technology that is neither revolutionary nor spectacular. We have seen it all before and done better might I add (the Jurassic Park films, Pacifim Rim, Cloverfield) just to mention a few. When asked in an interview if she enjoyed her brief but dramatic presence in the film, Juliette Binoche said this: 'I don't know how much fun you can have when you have to die in two seconds, and you're the one real woman character and you're dead in three minutes and 45 seconds.' I rest my case.",5,1,4,23 October 2014
Shall We Dance," We shall!
","Not bad, not bad at all. It's a remake of a Japanese film of the same title, and starring Jennifer Lopez, Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon. Lopez plays a dance teacher, Richard Gere plays an overworked corporate American and Susan Sarandon plays his wife. One evening, John Clark (Gere) misses his train and decides to take a walk before catching the next one when he spots a beauty(Lopez) in the window of a ballroom dancing class and decides the next day when he sees her again that he will take up dancing as a hobby. Now, you may be thinking that he is looking to have an affair, but that's far from the story. The minute John arrives at the dance studio, the audience is given an in-depth look into the lives of those who pay good money to go to such studios to learn the art of dance. Some do it because they must learn how to dance for such occasions as their wedding day, some do it to keep in shape, some do it for sanity, some do it because if they don't they might lose their sanity and others, well you know. When Beverly Clark (Sarandon) upon hearing one too many sob stories of cheating boyfriends and husbands at work, begins to notice that her husband has increasingly started to come home late, she hires a private detective, who sends out his boy, Scott(Played by a hilarious Nick Cannon) to keep an eye on John. Meanwhile, the detective has an eye for Beverly as well. John and Paulina(Lopez) get close but nothing more than friendship develops between them. When John realises the source of Paulina's pain he is inspired by it, as well as his funny co-worker played Stanley Tucci. Blink and you'll miss a cameo by pop singer Mya, she plays the bride of one of the studio's dancers. And there's also a nice song and video on the DVD entitled 'Sway' by the Pussycat Dolls.",7,0,0,11 September 2006

","Same script, different cast. I'm not sure why this film is so highly rated, I mean it had its moments and an attractive cast but haven't we seen it all before? I'm giving it 3 out of 5 stars because it could have easily been 5 out of 5 if they'd just toned down the unnecessary 'purge' violence and nonsensical objectification of the female characters. A princess is held against her will and promises sexual favours to a random guy who happens to just be by her cell and promises to open it as soon as he saves the world? Yeah right, Hollywood misogynists, go kick rocks. Better luck with part 2, which hits theatres in a few days.",4,1,1,14 September 2017
Easy A," A sheep in wolf's clothing...fast food pretending to be a gourmet meal
","Yeah it was pretty bad and hopelessly overrated too, I just watched it then came online immediately to comment. Nobody is gonna look back on this clichéd, heavily stereotyped, unfunny farce 10 years from now and say oh! wow! It's now a classic like the greater movies of the same genre from the 70s and 80s. Too much of it was far-fetched and unbelievable. That high school was more like a resort than a school and none of the kids looked like teenagers, they all looked like super-duper seniors. I respect Aly Mischalka for taking such a blink and you'll miss her role, I would be embarrassed too if I had been presented with such a lame script about nothing that addresses and resolves nothing. Pretty girl can't get dates so she pretends to be a floozy to get the attention of all the guys in her school...ugh! Okay. With so many jokes about other epic literary works, better films and stellar acting you would think that Easy A was about to take it to the next level but unfortunately it all falls flat about halfway through and follows the cliché of other similar movies rather than be the different film everybody expected it would be. Nothing new here people, same script, different cast.",4,15,25,25 June 2011
Honey," Rather Episodic but it's still a decent adaptation of real life events!
","Jessica Alba gives Jennifer Lopez a run for her money when she stars as real life choreographer Honey Daniels, a gifted club dancer who rose from Hood rags to Hollywood glory when she is discovered by a high profiled but over ambitious music video producer. The screenwriter should have paid more attention to the finer details rather than just writing overblown dance scenes that feature Alba trying her best possible to imitate the dancer she plays in the movie. There is almost no substance as we are taken to the streets of Harlem Newyork to watch where Honey was discovered, watch her humanitarian side (which takes a back seat) to her dancer side, to her meeting famed celebrities and working with them etc. etc. Joy Bryant, looking as skinny as ever plays Honey's best friend and there are many cameos from superstars like Missy Elliot, Ginuwine, Tweet, just to name a few and other co-stars include: Mekhi Pfeiffer (Honey's love interest), Romeo (one of the street kids whom Honey helps out) amongst others. Oh and if you're looking for that Christina Aguilera Song that played in the trailers of the film to be featured prominently, look again. The song is barely in the film. It's all good though.",7,0,2,26 July 2006
Sin City," It was awesome for those people who like films like this...
","Okay let me tell you about the cast first, I mean, how they were able to get all these people together to star in this film, I do not know. I am still in awe of them all. Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Alexis Bledel just to mention a few. It was great that all these people were there because I just enjoyed watching them, I didn't like the plot nor am I or have I ever been into Sin City the comic or anything like that. I went to watch to film purely based on the hype, and it delivered, to an extent. Okay, Bruce Willis plays an aging cop who suffers from angina (a heart condition) who saved a young girl once from the clutches of evil by way of the son of a tycoon (played by Nick Stahl), fast forward like 10 years later and the little White girl he saved grows up to be Jessica Alba's character, a hip swaying-lasso swinging bar dancer whom he comes face to face with much later in the film. Meanwhile, there's the character of Britney Murphy, a lousy waitress who is having an affair with Clive Owen's character behind her boyfriend's back, by the way her boyfriend is played by Benicio Del Toro. There are so many stories within the context of this one film but trust me they are all connected. Rosario Dawson (who showcases the best acting in this film) plays the leader of rebel prostitutes out to save their own necks and Josh Hartnett's character is an assassin. Oh, and Elijah Wood is also here too, in a silent and annoying role.",7,0,1,30 March 2006

I rented this because I like Gerard Butler and he owes big time with his next few movies otherwise I'm signing off of him for good.

Her," Unique, good but not great
","as much as I love Joaquin Phoenix, this was not his best work and having seen the film I am no longer upset that he got ignored by the academy and most other award giving bodies during award season because like I said, this wasn't his best work. Scarlett Johansson who doesn't even appear in the film (only her voice was used) stole the show and even she too was not up for accolade consideration so it is understandable if no other acting talent in the film got recognised. The script was unique enough; a man with mother and wife issues falls in love with his computer's operating system (voiced by Johansson) and complex issues arise there after. The main locations; Manhattan Beach, California and Shanghai China were spectacular. In fact when people pay special tribute or respect to props or locales that appear within a film, this one was/is definitely a candidate for such admiration because I felt that the scenic backdrops were as much as characters in the film as any of the humans starring in it. Rooney Mara and Amy Adams co-star. A great watch. Would I like to see it again? No but it was a visually stunning achievement in cinematography.",6,0,1,4 June 2014

I don't understand the negative reviews across the web, face it no book is ever going be adapted into a film just the way you see it in your mind and the same goes for video games or what not. The film crossed 400 million dollars on a 160 million dollar budget for a reason, it was good.

The Pursuit of Happyness," Just one off of Perfection!
","If your think you have it bad, then you need to see this film. Having seen the story of the real Chris Gardener as played out during his visit to the Oprah Winfrey show last year, I finally got to see The Pursuit of Happiness last night. It was good and I mean very good. Honestly, the promos did it no justice. I haven't gotten around to seeing Will Smith (who plays Chris Gardener here) in Ali so forgive me if I call his performance in this film the crowning performance of his career. This will be hard to top in future roles.In Pursuit, we meet Chris Gardener (as played by Will Smith) a man who is coming to terms with a bad business decision he made, while battling a nagging wife (played by a very twitchy Thandie Newton) and trying to make sure that his son (played by Smith's real life offspring Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) doesn't have the sort of childhood that he had. Slowly but surely, things begin to fall even more apart when his wife abandons him, his landlord evicts him and the IRS chomp down on his savings account for owed back taxes. Nevertheless, Gardener still manages turn his life around by switching professions, keeping his determination, finish up as a door-to-door salesman, all with his young son in tow as at this point he had become a single father.tons of kudos to Smith Jr., for as a child he acted very well and broke some major hearts in the theatre. Not much can be said for Thandie Newton though, who plays the boys mother in the film. She was horribly miscast as the American woman she plays. I mean what was up with that nervous Druggie twitch? And that default weird southern accent she always seems to fall back on whenever she plays an American. Come on now Thandie, get creative! The soundtrack was great as were the co-stars. A splendid film indeed.",9,0,0,20 January 2007
The Island," I don't understand how and why it flopped because to me it was excellent!
","The Island is the type of movie you look forward to seeing after paying $10.50 per entry at the cinemas these days. It's action packed, there's romance, there's comedy, and there's the realism to it! Could you possibly ask for more? Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor, play two genetic clones who get way ahead of themselves when they realise their true identities and go on a quest to try and right the wrongs that they and their kindred have been dealt and deluded into believing. The premise of rich people investing in human clones of themselves, being kept in an secret underground lab somewhere safe for the rainy day is not only barbaric and scandalous, it makes an excellent plot for a movie which Michael Bay snatched up and is presenting to you in this film. You can never put anything past the powers that be, especially when it comes to finding the fountain of youth. The Island is a must see for all!",10,3,7,2 March 2006
