The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Understandibly slow
","Having read the reviews that 'Mockingjay Pt1' has received till now I am forced to wonder, did anybody seriously expect anything of worth to happen in this film? It is only the first third of the book and nothing ever happens in the first third. We start as Katniss is being airlifted to District 13 where she is cajoled into becoming 'The Mockingjay' the symbol of the resistance. To do this she appears in a very bad mocked up propaganda video which fails to inspire and only gets it together when she witnesses the Capitol firebombing a hospital at which point she screams the immortal lines 'If we burn, you burn' at President Snow. The film then follows the path leading up to, we presume, the invasion of Capitol by the resistance. The film itself isn't too bad and Jennifer Lawrence, as always, gives an intense performance and while she is on the screen, the viewer is totally captivated. I am looking forward to the second half which is sure to be action packed. My only gripe is not with this movie but with the decision by Hollywood that every third book has to be split into two parts. It didn't work with 'Twilight', it didn't work with 'The Deathly Hallows', and it probably won't work with 'Mockingjay' but greed and the wish to bleed cinema goers of every last buck will probably ensure that they keep on doing it.",10,0,6,22 March 2015
The Maze Runner," Cube meets Lord of the Flies
","I actually enjoyed this movie. I was expecting a tedious boring book to film carve up like Divergent and instead got a well paced adventure with some pretty solid characters. OK, the story isn't totally original; kids put in a primitive setting left to survive or die is straight out of Lord of the Flies and the shifting maze is just like Cube but it kept up the pace and suspense just enough to hold my interest. I have just one question that maybe they didn't explain properly; what was the point of the runners? They couldn't escape through the maze, they had to return by nightfall but they got nothing out of it because their supplies came up from the pit so why run through it at all? Apart from that it wasn't a bad movie. Unlike Divergent(which was full of one dimensional pretty things) I am anticipating the sequel.",8,0,1,11 February 2015
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Poorly conceived sequel.
","I was really looking forward to this movie when it first came out. The first Terminator was and remains an absolute classic. A sequel promised more of the same with cutting edge effects, it should have been awesome. Instead, what we got was a fuzzy, cuddly terminator sent back to protect a masculine Sarah Conner and her unbelievably bratty son from the T1000 which was the only thing worth watching in this huge disappointment. The special effects WERE brilliant, I still love the sequence when the T1000 comes up through the floor but everything else about this bloated mess was over the top. Instead of the cold killer from the first movie, Arnie is almost human; certainly more so than the miserable portrayal Linda Hamilton gave. It's easy to see where Lena Headey got her inspiration from for her awful portrayal of the character. Also, are we seriously expected to believe that the nauseating, thieving little toe-rag played so badly by Edward Furlong could possibly grow up to be the saviour of humanity? Add to that the cheesy dialogue and all the silly one liners, catchphrases and explosions and what you are left with is nothing more than a Disney style movie with Michael Bay delusions. I gave this movie four and that was for the special effects, otherwise I would have given it a 1. It's a pity IMDb don't allow us to vote turkey, because this film deserved one.",4,4,18,25 January 2015
Divergent," Poor cousin
","This film could have been awesome if it wasn't so incomprehensibly silly. Obviously based on the Hunger Games (factions, teenagers fighting) this film takes all the good aspects of that film and copies them very badly. The heroine, Tris is totally unbelievable. Unlike Katniss I couldn't see her winning a game of tiddlywinks let alone a knife fight. The evil government is a one dimensional stereotype that seems to exist in all this type of film and the inevitable romance between her and Four(??) might as well have been announced in the opening, it was so obvious. I will admit that the book is a thousand times more interesting than this drivel and the main reason it fails is because unlike Maze Runner, which has solid characters, and Hunger games, which has the brilliant Jennifer Lawrence, Divergent is just a mass of clich√©s and bland performances. Do yourself a favour and give this a miss.",2,1,1,11 February 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A disappointing end to a disappointing series.
","I didn't know whether to review this film as a fantasy film or a book film adaptation, it wasn't easy. As an adaptation it failed on all levels. The basic outline of the third part of the book was there but all the content had been changed. Characters who weren't mentioned in the book (Legolas, Frodo, Radagast) characters who weren't even in the Middle Earth mythology (Alfrid, Tauriel) scenes that weren't in the book (Galadriel, Saruman and Elrond Freeing Gandalf and Radagast)I could go on. The stupid love story between an Elf and a Dwarf. The conflict between just about everyone. (Thranduil was a proud elf but this film made him out to be an all time bastard. He and Bard joined forces willingly not grudgingly and no Elf King would banish someone just for having feelings.) Thorin accusing his kin of betraying him. It was as if Jackson had taken a two minute pop song and made a full blown symphony out of it. So, to the fantasy film aspect. What a let down. The cgi (and there was far too much of it) was slapdash and not at all convincing. The battle scenes looked like fan fiction copies of the Two Towers battles, the final confrontation of Thorin and Azog was predictable, the worm things were preposterous and of course we have the daft sliding down rooftops, mudslides and whatever ludicrous ninja moves Jackson could throw at us. Also, for two people who weren't even in the book, there was an awful lot of Tauriel and Legolas. The most annoying character, however, was Alfrid. What was Jackson thinking, did he think we wanted a Jar Jar Binks? There is no doubt that Jackson did a marvellous job with the Lord Of The Rings but he should hang his head in shame for this mess, it's an insult to every true Tolkien fan.",3,11,20,25 February 2015
Lucy," Off the wall brilliance
","I was a little sceptical about watching this film as I had heard nothing good about it. Only the presence of Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman persuaded me to give it a chance. Am I glad I did. This was off the wall brilliance and one of the most original films I've seen. (Before anyone tells me there are others, I haven't seen them so can't comment) I loved the idea of Lucy being able to open her brain to encompass the world around her because of the drug seeping into her stomach. OK, the idea is preposterous and the set pieces a bit ludicrous but that didn't matter because this is science fiction and I was able to willingly suspend my disbelief, a little like Lucy suspended the bad guys in mid air. I loved the ending where she became one with the universe and met her namesake in the past. Scarlett Johansson is becoming well known for oddball films and I, for one, applaud her for it. This film will not please everyone, as is evident by some of the negative posts on here but it is a must have for my collection. Give it a try, you may be surprised.",10,11,21,27 January 2015
