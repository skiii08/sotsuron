","I admit that everything falls into place quite neatly (almost too neatly) and doesn't wrap with the same impact as say 'The Usual Suspects' but LNS is a fantastic movie. Hartnett is superb (I would say the best I have ever seen him) whilst Willis, Freeman and Kingsley never fail to deliver.From the moment I saw the trailer I knew I would enjoy this film, and I was not let down. I have seen other reviews slating it for being predictable and unoriginal - ignore them because if you are a film fan you will enjoy this. This movie is everything 'Revolver' tried to be: slick, stylish, great acting, superb script. It is at times very funny (especially Hartnett), violent but ultimately engrossing...",8,32,71,26 February 2006
