The Blair Witch Project," Great marketing, rubbish film
","How anyone was frightened by this is beyond me.  What a fabulous con trick. Sheer media hype made an undeserved fortune for this rubbish.  Imagine paying to see nothing happen in the cinema!!  It might have been fun to watch some of the audience fall for the con, but I couldn't be bothered, so I got it out on video and kept myself awake long enough to reassure myself it was exactly what I thought it was...brilliant marketing.",1,2,4,19 June 2003
