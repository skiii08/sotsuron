The Hangover," Carl the Critic: The Hangover
","Ah Todd Philips. Oh I remember when you were just beginning in the business. You've made such timeless classics as 'Road Trip,' 'Starsky and Hutch,' and of course 'Old School.' But now you have a new title, a new story, and cast of new comers who work well together on the big screen. The acting and dialogue is very clever, and the stories twist was the best twisted ending of the year. I particularly enjoyed how the drug ruffian and roof were tied in together to make the twist in the end even more spectacular than anyone could hope for. The films swearing could have been toned down a tad, and the film does drag on some scenes but then when you least expect it BOOM! out of no where there's a tiger in the bathroom. I also feel that the film's realistic style gives it a greater sense of humor (because things are funnier if they seem like they are really happening.)Keep it up, make more great films, and you are awesome!",8,1,2,10 November 2010
Citizen Kane," Carl the Critic: Citizen Kane
","I am not a big fan of Citizen Kane, it's just one of those films like The Dark Knight, where everyone says it's the greatest film ever and then you go see it with high expectations only to be disappointed. But is Citizen Kane a terrible film? Well that will all depend on what you are looking for in a film. If you are looking for a movie that makes you feel good, has a good story, and likable characters than Citizen Kane is not your movie. The movie is a Film Noir with elements of both realism and formalism that make the story dull and confusing. It is very depressing and hard to get into, and Kane, the character is a total a**h***.However for those of you who are studying film making, you need to watch this movie. Citizen Kane is what is known as a text-book film, it is long and boring but every shot in the film is perfect and these are all techniques that every inspiring film maker should watch and study. Films schools will make you watch this film anyway so why not get a head start right now. Meanwhile I'll just sit here and wait until you are done.(2 hours and 30 minutes later)Finished!? See what I mean about the story. It's dreadful, depressing, and it makes me want to kill Charles Kane... Again. But what makes this film very disappointing for me is the ending. Although well photographed it tells you that all along Kane's last words 'Rosebud,' was in reference to his sled... Are you kidding me! I had to sit here for two and a half hours watching this only to learn that the guy was talking about his freak-en' sled! Oh well, I guess I can't complain too much, it is Citizen Kane after all, the movie that made Billy Wilder movies awesome by creating a new genre of film.",5,3,8,17 November 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Carl the Critic: Kill Bill Vol. 1
","As far back as I can remember, Quentin Tarantino's movies have always failed to impress me. He is a formalist film maker, with action moves that seem to defy the laws of Physics, Probability, and the US Constitution. However I was really surprised when I saw Kill Bill Vol. 1, because it was the first time that I began to gain some respect for Tarantino. Never before have I ever enjoyed Uma Thurman in a role where she kicked so much ass before. Lucy Liu was good too, but to me it didn't make sense that she would be speaking English to a room full of people who speak Japanese. From beginning to end the film was action packed, serious, and at the same time very funny and well photographed.Don't get me wrong, I still have trouble watching Quentin Tarantino's movies, and even this one still defied the laws of physics, probability, and U.S. Constitution, but that last one doesn't really apply because the film primarily takes place in Japan, and also the film is so well done that even I as a Film Critic found it very hard not to enjoy myself. But what gets me is why doesn't Quentin Tarantino make more films like this?",8,0,2,9 November 2010
The Dark Knight," Carl the Critic: The Dark Knight
","Every where I go people always say how great the Dark Knight was, how its was such a great movie, how the film should deserve an Oscar for Best Picture! I say NO IT DOES NOT! gasp 'What!? you don't like the dark knight?' you may be asking me.'No,' I would reply, 'as a movie I did not think that it was a good movie at all, and I know no one will say this but I feel that this film was a horrible story, and the photography of the film was not that impressive.''But,' you may reply 'Heath Ledger was the best Joker ever!''True,' I would reply, 'Heath Ledger was indeed the best Joker ever, and he did deserve that Oscar for Best Actor, but he was one actor that made the movie enjoyable for me, the rest of the film was not all that impressive. Two Face should have been saved for the sequel instead of this film because it just made the film longer instead of dragging on for ever making my butt hurt in the theater.'However I must confess that the score for the film was still good, even though it was the same thing as the FIRST film, and that it is not really the worse Batman ever made. That title was given to 'Batman and Robin,' but what I'm saying is that people should not be so conformist when it comes to films such as this, people need to watch the film for more than Heath Ledger, because every time I ask people what made it good 100% of the people say Heath Ledger. He was the best Joker, but this was not the best Batman, in fact I'm thinking the film should be retitled 'The Joker,' because his role was much more significant than Batman (who still talked as if he had been smoking tobacco out of a bazooka for the past 10 years.)",7,6,11,9 November 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Carl the Critic: Sherlock Holmes
","Guy Ritchie is the British equivalent of Stephen Spielberg here in the US. He has great talent, he works with big named actors and the movies he makes are usually successful because everyone knows who he is. But unlike Spielberg, Ritchie is a film maker that is know as a formalist, where the film is all about 'does everything look good?', rather than the realistic style of film making where one would ask 'could this actually happen?' 'Sherlock Holmes' is a perfect example of this, because you don't care if the story good, (if there really was one, it just seemed too labyrinth like, and any where you turn could get you lost or going in circles.) But a movie doesn't need a story to be good, it just needs to look good (which this film does), sound good (which this film does thanks to both the sound and music departments), and have very strong and likable actors (which this film does for the most part.)But the majority of the film was about Robert Downey Jr. kicking some hardcore butt, giant explosions, very well executed sense of humor and the overall mood of the film matched perfectly with the setting (and vice versa.)Was this film like the original Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Doyle? You bet your sweet lippy it's not. Of course it is nothing like the original Sherlock Holmes, because Holmes was just an English detective, as opposed to the film where he was an English detective and at the same time an Irish Cage fighter.But that is not important! Mr. Ritchie just took Sir. Arthur's classic character and made him his own.There were a few times where I was confused, the 'story' that the film was trying to tell got a little too detailed, and I felt that scenes where Holmes shows how he was going to beat up the other guy in slow motion step-by-step before he really beat the guy up was repetitive and pointless. But besides for that, I really enjoyed the film, and Guy Ritchie has some extraordinary talent as a film maker. I just hope he doesn't screw up the sequel to this, and Mr. Ritchie I am still waiting for the release of the sequel to 'Rock and Rolla.'",8,0,0,10 November 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Carl the Critic: The Shawshank Redemption
","OH MY GOD!!! Such an amazing film! It's nice to know that Stephen King can do more than stories about Evil Spirits killing things. This film is perhaps on of the greatest films ever made! It is a movie about truth, justice, bravery, and prison rape (what more can one ask for!) Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make a perfect match for this film, and despite one or two moments of slow tension between Robbins and everyone else in the film, it is very deep, powerful,thought provoking, jaw dropping, eyes widening, and spine chilling from beginning to end. The only thing I don't understand is 'WHERE ARE THE WOMEN!?' This film is 99.9999999...9999% men and only 0.0000000...0001% women (at the very beginning having sex) but that is seriously the only complaint one can make about this film, other than the fact that it is long and depressing. The ending is down right perfect, and I had found myself in awe when I saw Andy (Tim Robbins) crawl through a 500 yard sewage pipe only to come out the other side a free man. What makes me curious about the film is why haven't people noticed that he was carving a hole behind the posters? He had changed them occasionally, there must have been some time when someone walked by and noticed a hole in the wall. The film's realism sucks you in like a vacuum cleaner to the point where you feel like you are a prisoner in Shawshank just chilling with Freeman and the gang of prisoner who bet on which prisoner is gonna cry first.",10,0,0,17 November 2010
