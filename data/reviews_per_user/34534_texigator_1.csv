United 93," Profoundly Moving
","As a previous reviewer stated, when the movie ended, the theater in which I watched it was completely and utterly silent for many moments. I think this film is very important for all Americans to watch. It deals with the reality of our times and presents the truth, to the best of our knowledge. For those who say the movie came out too soon, I would echo the sentiments of Todd Beamer's dad who said: 'It is not too soon to honor those heroes. It is not too soon to understand that we are at war.' Filmed in a style that evokes the feeling of watching a documentary, the movie is extremely well acted and paced. It provides a very emotional, very real movie experience.",10,1,3,1 May 2006
