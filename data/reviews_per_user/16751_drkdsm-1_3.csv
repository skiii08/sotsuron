Your Name.," A pure visual, auditory, mentally-satisfying, spiritual, magical, spell-binding extravaganza
","The 'anime' form has a limited niche of audience may be due to the fact that computer-generated animation appears to be an eye-candy! Well these were my thoughts before I watched this movie (in Japanese). And boy, I was so wrong! I had watched Spirited Away in English a long time back due to its such rave reviews but somehow i felt that I missed something in that movie that others could see and I could not. And that was the end of my 'anime' career. Fast forward 4 years and here I was going through a rough patch of time as I beginning to think that good movies are not being made anymore and that I have watched everything there is to watch and that creativity has limits too! Well you can always be denounced wrong if you have directors like Mr Makoto Shinkai. Hats off to this great director and the music composers Mr Youjirou Noda and the Radwumps band!!! They have produced a masterpiece. A gem of a gem! What sweet romantic love story, a perfect romcoms! Also many praises to the editor of the movie that is again Mr Shinkai... The chemistry between the two lead characters is so strong and intense that you will be spell-bound. First half was a 'feel-good' part that made me thought is this what the people all raving about? True even in first half, some of the scenes with the background song ZenZenZense were absolutely stunning like the scene with sunrise in the city and sunset in the rural area. Both are shot with absolute precision. Then the second half starts and you ate really caught off-guard. Now you will be really into the story that what is going on and what will happen further! I was on the verge of tears at 3 points in the movie and simultaneously I was pitching for the two protagonists. The comet scene with the song SPARKLE in the background provided a breath-stopping view of the beauty of the scenery. End of the movie was mentally satisfying when you are so much into the characters that any more tragedy might have made me crying my heart out. Now I admit that it took me 3 viewings to fully understand the story due to its complex plot but when you think you have seen every good story in the world then such a refreshing original story is really a big welcome. Now something about the background score and music! When you are watching a foreign language movie and there are no lyrics for the background music and even then you are perfectly in sync with the music, you get to know that the music composers, lyricist and singer have achieved a feat. Music is absolutely lovely. The end score 'Nande mo naiya' was so ear-candy that I heard it like 15 times before closing this movie off! I immediately bought the Japanese original soundtrack and kept on listening (with English lyrics of course) to it for next 2 days. Only then I got to know that there is an English version of the movie and English version of songs. And now I am writing this review I am listening to the English version of the song 'Sparkle'. I am glad that I watched the movie in Japanese. May be if I would have watched the movie 'Spirited Away' in its original language then I might have connected it to better. I am looking forward to watching more anime movies and I am really thankful to God that I got to see this movie in this lifetime. I have recommended this movie to more than 100 people till now and still counting. Please give yourself a treat, a peaceful heart-touching rest by watching this movie with your loved one. May be if you are going through a rough patch of time in your relationship then this movie might just be the thing that will rejuvenate your love! Again I can just go on boasting about this movie for eternity but before that watch it yourself and prove me correct. P.S. - The plot of this movie has a bit of resemblance with the Bollywood movie 'Haunted 3D' which was India's first 3D in-home production, a horror zoner. Indian viewers who liked that movie would feel an instant connection with this movie. This movie is remembered more for its sweet love story and melodious music rather than for acting skills or overall storyline. Watch it at your leisure for the sweet horror love story and songs that you will keep on lipping for years to come.",10,4,8,14 May 2017
The Hurt Locker," Worst day of my Hollywood movie watching career! This is no match to Avatar. Critics and Oscar Judges must apologize publicly for choosing this...
","I first watched La La Land and then the Hurt Locker today as I was in a really good mood to watch movies. Both movies are Oscar Winners and critically acclaimed. La La Land was a big disappointment from Hollywood so I thought may be I should give a try to a war movie. Hurt locker was an obvious choice. The underdog! The revenge of the Ex-wife! The Hollywood movie with least box-office collection to win an Oscar! Avatar-crushing! And what not... Naturally when you start a movie with such huge expectations, you need a visual treat or a deadly story line or a performance which blow you off. But at the end of this movie (as well as La La Land), I was cursing myself for wasting my whole day. Firstly was there any actual suspense/thrill in this story? A definite no. Was there any good action sequence? No. Was there any story-line? Yes that this person has guts, so what! Was there any inspiration or a learning point in this movie or something you will cherish a long time after? NO. Would you be able to recommend this movie to anyone? NO. Did this movie really deserved Oscar? NO. Did this movies production quality, story-line, action sequences, acting prowesses, direction, the 'wow' factor, laughability, likability, humor stood any chance against Avatar? If NO could have some even negative quality than this would have been for this movie. Did this movie would really stand the test of time? No. Would you like to re-watch this movie ever? No. Did this movie deserve such high rating on IMDb? NO. I can really go on and on and on writing negative things about this movie. The only positive thing about this movie was that it was short so wasted less of my time and that it showed skills of a bomb diffuser which was new for me. Rest i will really like the Critics and Oscar Judges to wrote a public apology to James Cameroon for choosing this movie above Avatar. This movie was penned down by critics and film festivals on initial release. It only gained momentum later on due to efforts of some really good PR skills, the sympathy factor because of Katherine Bigelow being the ex-wife of James Cameroon (the victim game), sympathy from being the only movie in Oscar history whose producer was stopped from being able to attend the Oscar ceremony (as he tried to influence the judges) and the sympathy from the fact that it was a really low-budget movie competing against the biggy that is Avatar. I request critics to be rational. IMDb is such a popular site among movie goers that people will not stop watching this movie due to its high ratings and Oscar-tag and at the end they will find them being cheated like me. P.S. - I remember saying so many 'NO's' only once when I had not prepared for the viva and my teacher was asking me all sorts of tough questions to which I had no answers. Please don't waste your time watching this movie.",3,3,6,14 May 2017
La La Land," Pure waste of time, Bollywood produces far better musical intricate love stories
","This is my first review of any film on IMDb. I saw this film as it has won multiple Oscars and the story showed some premise. I had not seen the trailer. After watching the movie, I was like why I wasted my time on this. I should have gone to watch Meri pyari bindu, heck, even OK Jaanu was way more fun and better love story than this. Bollywood really knows how to make love stories, specially the intense ones. Westerns often bash Bollywood movies for their music and dance numbers (which according to them erupt spontaneously). Then, what was in this movie! Some melodious songs, some over the top dance steps! There is recent trend in Bollywood movies to incorporate the songs with the story-line so that it is not a hindrance in the progress of the story (watch 'dangal' for example). My final words are if this movie can win Oscar than heck 25% of Bollywood movies also can. If any of you really liked this movie due to the 'music-dance-love story saga', you are gladly invited to the world of Bollywood.",3,5,8,14 May 2017
