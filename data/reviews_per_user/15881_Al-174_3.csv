Ghost," Lovely!
","Truly a recommended classic, for me that is. With some of my favorite casts like Whoopi Goldberg and Demi Moore. I also like the way the story has been built up; with laughter and tears.",Null,5,9,24 June 1999
The Fifth Element," Is Bruce Willis That Bad?
","Don't get me wrong, Willis fans. I like Bruce Willis and I love his films. But how come most critics just can't get to see how Mr. Willis work for this film. Look at Armageddon, it had been awarded as one of the worst movie of the year. But I will still like Mr. Willis.",Null,0,1,4 June 1999
Aladdin," Fascinating!
","It may seem preposterous to think that I would still like this film, but of course, I do. How much do I need to ask for? Good cast, lovely characters, melodic songs, and whatever good things that comes into your mind.",Null,1,1,24 June 1999
