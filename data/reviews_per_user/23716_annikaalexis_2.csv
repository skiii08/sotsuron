It," Not scary.
","I did not find it frightening enough. A good movie woth good, steong characters, but bad effects, therfore it wasn't believable. Plus, could've gone without some of the cheesy, badly acted scenes. 8/10!",8,1,3,21 March 2019
Joker," Overall, very good
","A very good movie. I wasn't quite prepared when I went to see it, so it did damage me quite a bit. I might have a scar where I scratched myself after the movie from the anxiety, and I give you that information because it's basically me saying you should be careful when seeing this movie. I am not actually very sensitive, in fact, the violence didn't affect me at all, but it was all too real--the political side of it.tl;dr: It was a very good movie. It was a bit slow, I felt, but well made, and Joaquin did brilliantly. But be careful. It's very realistic and can be very mentally damaging.",9,4,9,16 December 2019
