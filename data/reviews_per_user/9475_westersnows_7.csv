Casablanca," Casablanca (1942)
","I have always loved this film, and I will continue to love it indefinitely. There's nothing that I have a problem with, which is really unusual. The story is great, the atmosphere is great, and the photography is SPECTACULAR (I love the shadows and the lamps). And Bogart and Bergman are perfect. There's just enough mystery to keep it going at a steady pace. The dialogue is good too- - entertaining and witty, but it's not out of this world. I also like that the ending differs from the expected, leaving the audience intentionally disappointed that Rick doesn't go with Ilsa (in a good and necessary way, I think). Okay, I lied; there is one little thing that bothers me. I appreciate this film more from an aesthetic standpoint —I don't get much emotional connection to it.",9,2,3,26 March 2014
Chinatown," 'You can't eat the Venetian blinds. I just had them installed on Wednesday.'
","This is such a classic, and all around great film. But, I honestly think the plot was a tiny bit dry. Yes, it's a mystery with lots of twists and turns and surprises. But after a while it begins to feel a bit like a scandal within a scandal within another scandal (scandal-ception?) There was no real tension, and it seemed like they were just adding plot details to draw it out. There was also a little bit too much dialogue for my tastes. That being said, I also appreciated that it wasn't paced like a typical 'murder mystery,' and the way in which it unfolded was slightly more lifelike. What was redeeming for me was the ending (which a lot of people hate apparently). The characters have been on this wild goose chase, only to have it not play out in their favor. Which I think has to be a VERY conscious decision to do, because it's not what's expected and therefore under scrutiny. I think it fits here though, especially since the previous parts of the film didn't give you the feeling something bad was going to happen—it seemed like Jake would prevail. A lot of the time, films with an 'unhappy' ending have a pessimistic tone throughout so it's almost as if you expect it. I really love the camera and lighting work. Specifically that slightly yellowed tone (but never too yellow) with orange-y reds that appears in a bunch of films from this era. It looks as though they need to add a bit of cyan, but I'm pretty sure it was intentional. It's also rather difficult to duplicate—I've tried. It references film noir a little, but clearly has a twist to it that's more current to 1974. I believe it's called neo noir. And one more thing: the soundtrack was amazing, but it was used rather poorly, and in a way that called attention to itself. This could be intentional, but it felt unintentional.",7,0,1,29 April 2014
Gone with the Wind," After all, tomorrow is another day.
","I've seen this film once before, and I have to say I liked it much better this time around. I think that's because the first time I watched it right after reading the book, and there were so many differences that were hard to overlook. It's been a few years though, and approaching it from a cinematic standpoint changes the perspective. I absolutely love the editing, composition, lighting, set design, and color use in this film. I just cannot get over how amazing it is, and it contributes so well to that romanticized Old South feeling, and the depiction of wartime. The overall mood is so strong it's incredible. A lot of my family is from the south, and there's just something about this film that captures a certain feeling/dynamic that is still somewhat present. My one problem with it has always been Vivien Leigh. I just don't think she's Scarlett, no matter what anyone else says—book Scarlett had so much more depth. She's the one thing I cannot forgive in this adaption.",9,2,4,10 March 2014
The Graduate," 'Mrs. Robinson, if you don't mind my saying so, this conversation is getting a little strange.'
","I've waited so long to see this, and it was worth it. Dustin Hoffman is amazing, and such a versatile actor even when he was young. I could go on and on about how absolutely nothing in the film adds up correctly, but I won't because I think it somehow helps construct the odd sense of humor that's there. I will say, the one thing that bothers me the most is Ben's lack of self-motivation and reliance. He's 'drifting' and he needs to rely on another person to give him direction. But, although this personally bothers me, it works with the story, and I'd say is rather part of the point. So parts are unrealistic, yes, but it's in such a way that's absolutely hilarious to the right taste. This is another one of those films that I think people think about too seriously—it's supposed to be funny!The cinematography is great, as is the editing. There are a lot of famous examples in this film, and they don't disappoint. My personal favorite is the use of the deep space and focus when Ben is implying to Elaine that his affair was with her mother. The camera is pointed at her over Ben's shoulder, and then pulls focus to Mrs. Robinson's face and we see Elaine's realization as is comes slowly back. The editing had great continuity, as well as the more famous examples like the smooth transitions from Ben's house and pool to in bed with Mrs. Robinson. The soundtrack is wonderful.",9,0,0,29 April 2014
Singin' in the Rain," 'Hey Joe, get me a tarantula.'
","Ah, this movie. It makes me miss tap and ballroom dancing. I haven't seen it in ages, and I absolutely could have sworn that it was black and white, but I'm rather glad that it wasn't, as the color was amazing. A little over the top at some parts but, I understand that they're showing off a bit. However, I honestly don't think it'd be quite as spectacular if it weren't in color. Aside from the work of the camera around the choreography, I can't say I specifically like the filmmaking itself. But, I did enjoy the movie.It's everything a musical should be: funny, witty, universally enjoyable story, historical context, and of course great songs. That's one of the reasons that I think musicals like this are so well remembered, because of the songs. They just stick in your head. I've always had a bit of a problem with movie musicals (90% of the time I'd rather see them on stage) but there's something about the ones from the early 50s that are just great, this one included.",9,0,2,8 April 2014
Pulp Fiction," 'If my answers frighten you then you should cease asking scary questions.'
","I have waited a very long time to see this for some reason, and I am now only disappointed that I didn't watch it sooner. Rarely famous films live up to my expectations, but this one certainly did. Possibly a new favoriteSince I really have nothing to criticize, I will say a few things that I liked the best. Firstly, the lighting and camera and just overall 'look' I am totally in love with. It fits the subject matter so well, and just feels right, and kind of quirky. There's also something special about the vibrancy and colors here too. Some of the camera angles I found rather nice as well: especially the low angle shots, and the close ups on the action. I also think the fragmented plot, and 'unnecessary' dialogue makes the film what it is. I hear people complaining that it's difficult to understand what's going on in the sequence of events, but even so it's hard to imagine it working any other way. The characters are fabulously written and acted, and the compiled score is inspired.",10,0,2,8 May 2014
Psycho," ' I think I must have one of those faces you can't help believing.'
","Another favorite. I'm pretty sure this film is to blame for my early and unending love of thrillers and horror films (only the good ones though). As usual, the photography is my favorite part, as well as the editing, since both aid each other extremely well. I'm not even going to touch the shower scene, that's been analyzed to death (but I do love it). My favorite part of the photography is when she's asleep in the car, and the cop comes and talks to her through the window. The close ups in that scene are amazing. A+ acting too, perfect amount of tension. I also like when she's driving and all the bright lights are blinding her from the other side of the road. I'm so pleased they decided to film this is b&w.There are a couple other things I'd like to mention too. First, this film totally flaunts the code, right from the opening scene. I normally wouldn't have noticed it as a casual viewer but bearing in mind film history, this is the beginning of the end of the code (finally!). Second, the score is absolutely brilliant. About 90% of my music collection is film scores and I've been a fan of Bernard Herrmann since realizing he did a great number of soundtracks for Hitchcock films (North by Northwest is great, and some non Hitchcock films like Mysterious Island are good too). But wow, the Psycho score is really quite amazing. It's so unobtrusive yet brilliantly sets the mood. And I'm not talking about the screeching strings, even though they're the most famous.",10,3,4,8 April 2014
