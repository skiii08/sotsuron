3:10 to Yuma," Epic!
","'3:10 to Yuma' was fantastic, I think the actors fitted their roles perfectly, the story was epic, the characters were great. It's good to see a modern Western film that doesn't suck. The story is about a Union civil war veteran who is desperate for money and takes on the task with a few law men to escort the leader of a gang called 'Ben Wade' to a train at 3:10 to Yuma station that will take him to a prison. But all is not what it seems..Personally my favourite character is 'Charlie Prince', who is portrayed by actor Ben Foster, he is a reckless Confederate veteran who is in 'Ben Wade''s gang. I hope more epic Western action movies like this are made soon.I recommend you watch this film if you enjoy Westerns'.",9,0,2,18 February 2012
Glory," Entertaining, a solid 7/10.
","I thought 'Glory' was a good film, but it didn't explore the complete story of the war, granted it was focusing on the black soldiers, but nevertheless it should have showed more of the horrors of the American Civil War.The Confederacy weren't showed enough, they didn't have a character who was consistently in the story, they only had crowds of Confederate soldiers yelling Southern trash talk etc. How ever I do feel this film shows how a lot of Union soldier/politicians actually were. People are under the influence that all Union soldiers fought just for slavery to be abolished. That is not true, this film shows how many soldiers treated the Nigroes like they were nothing, that is the ugly truth, many soldiers went to war to preserve the Union or just to fight for their state.The story was sad and revealed the heroism of some of the Negroe(African-American) soldiers of the Union Armed Forces. Matthew Broderick's performance was brilliant, I feel his true character as an actor is of how many citizens/soldiers of the Northern states felt at the time.I'd recommend this film to someone who enjoys learning about the American Civil War and African-American heroes. I hope this review helps.",7,1,2,12 February 2012
