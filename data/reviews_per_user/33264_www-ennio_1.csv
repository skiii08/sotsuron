The Incredible Hulk," More Action, did you say..?
","Everybody said that new 'hulk' was full of action.. That's not true. I wish that they were right but not. I expected, honestly.. In my opinion, Hulk(2003) was better than this and more likely than the other comic book movies.. Not because of this opinion i din't like The Incredible Hulk but the things that expected shamefully. The Abomination disappointments me as a villain but not Tim ROTH himself. We've waited so long for 'more action' and it finished so quick. Mysteries professor for such as, 'is this a joke' i said when his role was over ridiculously. Edward NORTON was good as usual with or without any 'Betty'. William Hurt also managed his role even with a bad script. CGI is not killing you as the audience said that so. Watching The Incredible Hulk was entertaining mostly. I don't mean that this movie is bad. I'm just complaining about some disturbing details, that's all. Being full of 'more action' is not this, mustn't this, cannot be this. As a movie lover (!), i'm expecting nice movements from 'this age's cinemas'.. They don't have to be more quick, more smart, more supported with CGI or full of 'action'.. Or they don't have to be that what we like it. Maybe, i can't explain myself clearly but i just felt like something is missing in this movie and the others that i was complaining about. More more more ..",6,2,4,24 June 2008
