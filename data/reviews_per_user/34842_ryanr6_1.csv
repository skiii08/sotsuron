Resident Evil: Afterlife," Terrible
","Had the potential to be a good film I'm a fan of the games and the previous films I had some beef with but not that much but this put simply is boke and I blame Paul W.S Anderson. No plot, serious lack of character development (which is very annoying considering its Chris Redfields 1st appearance in film franchise), continuity errors galore, plot holes the size of the Grand Canyon, Hollywood jobbers IE people who have no point other than no get killed taking up excess screen time, no plot oooo and did I mention no plot. Watse of time only redeeming feature is Milla Jovovich and tbh looking at the performance I think even she said this is a waste of my time.",3,0,2,6 December 2011
