The Finest Hours," We all live or we all die.
",THE FINEST HOURS is simply one of the finest movies I have ever seen. From the opening scenes where Young Bernie Webber is pulled into a blind date by his friend and He meets the Woman that becomes his wife. To Bernie's dedication to the coast guard. Chris Pine is totally engrossing as Bernie. The Story is one of Heroism sacrifice. And Skill and courage under fire . During a Winter Storm on Feb. of 1952 Two Oil Tankers fall victim to the raging waters one of the Ships the S.S. Pendleton breaks in half. The Men trapped on the floating Stern Are forced to work together to keep the floating hulk afloat. The Head Engineer Played brilliantly by Casey Affleck has the knowledge and the skills to keep them alive until they get rescued. But so far no one knows they are out there. And The other Oil Tanker commands all the attention. When the Pendleton finally gets the message out. The picking for rescuers are slim and Bernie is ordered by his commanding officer To mount a rescue . Bernie in command picks a crew and takes out the only boat remaining. A small boat. And in those waters agitated by the storm it amounts to a Suicide mission. As Bernie tells his men. 'They tell us to go out. They don't tell us to come back'! Bernie is also working under the spectre of a failed mission in which he failed to save the lives of a sinking ship the year before. So Bernie is looking for redemption. That and the fact that Bernie is driven to save those men. All lives matter to Bernie and to him failure is not even a option they'll do it or die trying.The Special Effects are spectacular. But they pale in comparison to the acting and the story. Both are the finest kind you'll see in any movie released this year. This movie easily climbed on to the top of my favorite movie list. The style of the movie is beautiful and makes one long for the simpler times back then. And makes us believe in heroes again.,Null,2,4,16 July 2016
Ali," CHAMPION ! The champ is here !
",ALI is Michael Mann's incredible take on the life of Ali. A hard task to do. Actually It's more of a harder challenge then most even think. name one person man or woman more well known then Muhammad Ali ? you can't. Ali was known the whole world over. the man was literally in a league of his own.Ali's Story started in Louisville Kentucky He was born Cassius Clay. as a young man of 12 he had a bike his parents gave him stolen. Crying clay went to the police station to make a report. Being poor meant his parents had to sacrifice a great deal to get him that bike and he felt so ashamed that someone stole it. there a police officer named Martin took Clay to the Police gym .where he taught kids how to box . Martin figured that clay needed something. and almost from the start clay became addicted. That Gym took him to the 1960 Olympics where he won a gold medal in boxing. but upon his return home he found the gold medal meant nothing. the color line was still drawn Clay felt as if the medal made him a performing animal In trying to find backers to finance his professional career Clay found himself going hat in hand to rich white people or older fighters like Archie Moore. Clay being a unique fighter needed a unique trainer and met Angelo Dundee and began his rise to the Championship. Ali Shows us everything stripping Ali bare of his Iconic status and laying the human being bare faults and all. Will Smith gives the performance of a life time and for once he deserved a Oscar He BECAME Ali. This movie like its subject is captivating and entertaining. And like Ali it is a Champion movie.,Null,1,3,6 June 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue one The Rebels Strike back.
",Rogue one is outstanding. The story is the best of all the Backstories that needed to be told. The movie has everything going for it. The pacing is remarkably done. And the movie has a little bit of everything and after its done you are put thru the wringer. Action suspense comedy Tragic events and even a hint of romance everything has the right amount and the right touches. Even the CGI is done wonderfully . The director and story writers studied Episode 4 very well and captured its spirit. The movie comes off as a triumph and it is. It's simply a Star Wars Tale told from long ago from before the Adventures of Luke Skywalker even began. And When Han Solo was the king of the Smugglers. A quick tossed away line in episode 4 When Mon Mothma tells our heroes how they got the plans. A group of Bothan Spies died getting those plans for us she told them. Rogue one is that story. Remarkable in every way. And Not a MI's step along the way. And this is perhaps the best movie of 2016.,10,4,8,18 December 2016
Rocky V," Nature is smarter then people think. the measure of a man.
",Rocky V gets a bad rap. the fans don't like it and the critics hated it and its the only Rocky movie to LOSE money at the box office. But I love it. Actually it's my favorite rocky right after The first one. And I'll tell you why. ROCKY III and ROCKY IV took Rocky out of his elements. ROCKY III HAD to do this as it showed how success affected Rocky. ROCKY IV had too many ideas going thru it. Man VS Machine VS Steroids And political Ideas running rampant. Rocky in an American Flag basically. Rocky IV is not a bad movie but I still don't take it as a serious Rocky movie. Rocky V on the other hand takes us back.Rocky V opens as Rocky starts to feel the effects of Drago's super punches He collapses in the shower and as a frightened Adrian holds him he talks to her and he speaks to Mickey we can't see him. rocky is existing in both worlds the living and the dead. He talks about how mickey used to fight so hard that sometimes he felt like he broke something inside and how he now feels it too. They go home to a media circus where George Washington Duke A crooked promoter is trying to get rocky to defend the Heavyweight Championship against his fighter Union Cane. Rocky is tired and Adrian tells the press after this match against Drago rocky is now officially retired. a medical check up reveals brain damage from drago's punches. Putting a end to Rocky's career. then rocky finds out he's broke sending him back. It seems he had a crooked accountant that tricked Paulie into giving him power of attorney and that and the fact that he had not paid Rocky's taxes in four years leaves them penniless. the Balboa's find themselves back where it all started in Paulie's old house. Rocky finds to his amazement that Mickey had left His gym to Rocky. and Adrian has gone back to the pet shop. sometimes it seems like they never even left.then Rocky meets a young fighter named Tommy Gunn. Tommy grew up idolizing rocky and wants him to train him and manage him. rocky takes him on and soon Tommy begins a quick rise to the top. But Rocky while living thru Tommy begins to lose his family.Tommy soon falls under the influence of George Washington Duke and he turns Tommy against Rocky. Tommy Wins the Heavyweight Championship but no one takes him seriously comparing him to Rocky. forcing them into a street fight. rocky Wins and he realizes. He didn't need the money the fame and the glory/ all he needed is his friends his family and Adrian.ROCKY V ends on a happy note. rocky is in a happy place and has his family back. And to me that is Where Rocky belongs On the streets of Philly not rich not poor but doing very Well for himself and inspiring others to do their best. Like I said ROCKY IV took him the furthest away from the roots of Rocky. Rocky V returns him to them.A Good solid story. and maybe the second best one in the series. at least for me. |,10,3,3,20 June 2016
Creed," the creation of a Champion.
",Creed. Is the first Stallone Rocky movie to not be written or directed by Stallone. Creed carries the spirit of Stallone's Rocky. and the Vision of Creed's writers and its director.

Creed isn't another Rocky movie. It stands on its own and needs to be its own franchise.,10,1,4,3 May 2016
MASH," Through the early morning fog , I see visions of things to be.
","MASH was in the 70's a great accomplishment. One of the greatest comedies of its time. Based on Richard Hooker's novel MASH which details the going on's of a mobile army surgery hospital during the Korean War. Hooker's novel was brilliant and funny. a black comedy gem that also spoke to the Vietnam war. Question Authority create chaos out of horror and repeat and leave. The Movie to its credit is actually faithful to the book which I proudly own and read quite a few times. The Story follows Three Doctors as they do a tour of duty at the 4077th MASH. Hawkeye Pierce ,Duke Forrest and Trapper John . Each are at war with the army and each does their best to cope with the horrors of the war. From tormenting Major Frank Burns to rigging a football game to helping a don Juan who is convinced he is now gay because he couldn't get it up one night. Hawkeye and the gang bring quite a few laughs. But this movie was made in a Era before political correctness took over and ruined the world. Black Comedy isn't supposed to be PC. Anyways you can see where the seeds were sown for the long running M.A.S.H. series Donald Sutherland makes the best Hawkeye as far as I'm concerned. Alan Alda's Hawkeye Pierce was just too tame and almost a reversal of everything the original Hawkeye stood for but I guess 11 years can do that to a guy. Anyways if you are not too PC and not too easily offended. And want to see a true piece of history. MASH just might be your type of movie. To me it was funnier then Dr. Strangelove and any of the other anti war movies that came out.",10,3,5,27 November 2015
The Doors," No one here Get's out alive. The Legend of Jim Morrison.
",THE DOORS Is a stand out Rock bio. first class all the way. Playing right up to the myths of Jim Morrison. The Story of The Doors is a easy one to tell. The Story of Jim Morrison isn't. Oliver Stone does his best here giving us the old John Ford adage. When the legend becomes fact print the legend. Morrison's childhood wasn't an easy one. A true genius Morrison read everything he got his hands on and memorized it books became his only friends.His only true friends in school remember him as a risk taker and a practical joker. The teachers Hated him Because Morrison Had been more well read then them and always thought outside the box. I time he became a Rebel against the system testing people Always testing them. Morrison became interested in film and went to The film school at UCLA there he met Ray Manzerek a Man that became his best friend and mentor . Thru Ray Morrison met Robby Kriger and John Densmore after Morrison read his poetry to Ray on a beach in Venice California after quitting film school Morrison spent a year on a friends roof top taking drugs and writing poetry. To Ray these sounded like songs. The popular line is Ray told Jim let's start a band and make a million bucks and Morrison replied I already have a name for it THE DOORS. That part is true. Morrison was influenced by the works of Huxley and the poems of William Blake took the line if the Doors of perception were cleared everything would appear as it is infinite. Together They created a revolution that is still felt today. The Myths of Jim Morrison are great stories but they eclipse the Actual Jim Morrison. The Jim Morrison that actually was a nice guy that cared about his fans and loved his friends and had a problem in Drugs and booze. The Drugs and Booze twisted Morrison into a bizarre parody of himself. A Morrison that slept with every woman that crossed his path and caught his eye. Yet a Morrison that was hopelessly in love with Pam Courson. They had a stormy and chaotic relationship as the movie indicates. But each was the love of the other's life. Morrison was also a first rate poet and a first rate singer. A fact that gets overlooked by his looks and his body. A fact he hated which is why in his later years Morrison became fat and bearded trying to destroy the sex god image. Oliver Stone touches on all of this and he gives us the myths trying to look like facts. and he omitted a lot. But it's a two hour long movie and Stone had to omit a lot but add in Indians and Foretelling Morrison's death. But the movie itself never suffers from that. In fact the movie is a steady roller coaster ride. Going from one extreme to the next that by the time it ends you just sit back and go Wow. And man does this movie make me miss Jim Morrison. I never knew him but it makes me wonder .What heights could this man have reached If he had still been alive. The possibilities are endless. Or maybe it was a merciful act by fate to take the Lizard King so early. Either Way the movie is a powerhouse keg of dynamite. As for Val Kilmer I've just one question. How the Hell did he NOT get nominated for his portrayal of Jim Morrison ? He should have been and Won the Oscar. His portrayal is simply that powerful. A Incredible movie by any means of the imagination.,10,2,3,26 June 2016
Suicide Squad," Welcome to the Suicide Squad complete the mission or die trying.
",suicide Squad is really a excellent adaptation of the DC Comic book. They got the basics down pretty well here. And the actors plating the Squad each do a tremendous job. While Margret Robie Is fantastic Eye Candy and Her Harley Quinn is the scene stealer of the movie the focus Should be put on will Smith as Floyd Lawton AKA Deadshot. Smith gives us a Deadshot without conscience or ethics except one. The love of his daughter. after a wonderful scene where Batman arrests him Deadshot becomes the head and soul of The Squad and Harley its Heart.The plot is simple There is a menace the super heroes can't handle it as its a killing mission. Assemble a Squad of Killers Mercs Freaks and a Hard Assed Colonel to go save the world. Fail to do so They Die by getting the bombs implanted in their heads blowing. Along the way this group of psychs learn to function as a team and finally as friends. And while they refuse to admit it. They become heroes.To me as a long time reader of John Ostrander's Suicide Squad run from the mid 80s This movie takes a lot from that run . And that alone is worth the price of the ticket.nicely paced good solid acting and lots of surprises makes this the summer movie of the year.,10,1,6,21 November 2016
Doctor Strange," Journey to a dimension not of sight or sound but of mind.
",Doctor Strange debuted in Marvel comics Tales of Suspense sharing the magazine with Nick Fury Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. The First few stories were clichéd and uninspiring Then Steve Ditko and Stan Lee expanded the worlds of Doctor Strange. Ditko didn't like Lee and when Lee just handed the story /plots off to Ditko he encouraged Ditko to get inspiration and to do what he did best design strange new worlds that no body could imagine and Ditko did just that. Afterwards Gene Colan took over and expanded it further. Lee was trying to create a world within worlds and that magic was real. Dr.Strange was often described as the acid trip comic of the 60's and That's saying a lot for the 60's Doctor Strange the movie picks up and expands and improves the comic in areas that were never made clear .The Basic Story is Doctor Stephen Strange is perhaps the greatest neurosurgeon in the World and he only takes the most challenging cases. Cases that'll bring him glory or money. Then one night Strange is in a car accident and his hands are damaged. he cannot operate ever again and loses his one reason for living.until he learns of the Ancient one and travels to Tibet. He begs and pleads for her to heal him. and then he gets a rude awakening into a bigger universe. Strange learns and studies to be the best and soon he becomes good enough to stumble on a threat to our world. A former student of The Ancient one and his followers are determined to hand this world over to the master of the dark dimension The Dreaded Dormmanu. The problem is they believe Dormmanu will grant them immortality where he just wants to conquer and destroy Earth. Doctor Strange is pulled into the fight and learns there is things that are not about him. And he becomes a hero and eventual Guardian.The Story isn't bad it could have been better but its still good enough. The Effects are stunning. And the story's pacing is good and steady. The director knows what he's doing and he does it smartly. You feel the movie is progressing in its own time its not rushed and its payoff is a movie that feels natural and its a treat for the eyes.. Maybe the best Marvel has to offer and hopefully a good omen for Marvel's next phase of movies,10,1,5,19 November 2016
Interstellar," One of the most impressive films ever made.
",Interstellar is a grim what if question. What if The Earth stopped sustaining us? And we as a species faced extinction on a massive scale. and there was no way out ? Or what if there was ? would you take it ? despite the risk in never seeing your kids again? That is Christopher Nolan's Interstellar in a nutshell. Its the end of the 21st century. the Earth is dying and everyone on earth is forced to become farmers in order to survive. No more explorations no more NASA no more inventions or old ones for that matter. Everything is just turned to one end massive farming. But the earth is not co operating .Giant dust storms and earth wide famine is slowly killing off the planet. Where once there was Billions of people there may only be millions or thousands struggling to survive. Cooper is a rare breed a former test pilot for NASA he was the last great pilot to fly a rocket ship until the government shut it down to force funds into farming. Now the Earth is Dying and NASA has been restarted in secret to investigate a wormhole near Saturn that opens a gateway to 12 possible new homes. The only problem is time is running out. NASA tells Cooper they did send out 12 expeditions and now it will be up to Cooper and his team to determine which planet is the one The only trouble is they only have time to explore three and gather data. but which three and will they make it back in Earth in time ?Nolan has never written better nor has he ever directed anything better then this . Interstellar is a spectacular movie that deserves to be seen more then once. It explores ideas that has rarely looked at before. And according to the press releases . the science in this movie is accurate so it sounds very believable going into it. The acting is very god the leads are all exceptional and make this a memorable film.,Null,0,5,23 June 2015
American Sniper," Chris Kyle the most lethal sniper in U.S. Military history.
",American Sniper the book was a incredible read of action and heartbreak. and it told so much that no movie could contain it. When I saw American Sniper the movie. The basic parts of the book are in intact. Hollywood but intact. Although it glosses over Kyle's early years and it misses the point as Kyle's upbringing was not anything like that. nor was his rodeo career. Kyle had made his mind up long before any terror attacks to join the military. Kle had been badly hurt in a rodeo where a horse fell on him breaking his wrist badly which required pins. at first the navy passed on him because of this injury. but Kyle kept at it and got into the Navy S.E.A.Ls the elite and best of the best. Kyle's book goes into more in depth detail of his training then the movie does and it goes a long way to explain his actions. And his beliefs. It also explains a lot better about why he did what he did. But again since this is a movie it only has a limited time to tell the story. And it does with heart breaking accuracy. There is a lot of action and a lot of pain. As we see Chris Kyle progress from young Navy S.E.A.L to a husband and then a war vet.The movie's best parts are when he comes home between deployments and we see the toll the war is taking on him. Kyle is pushed back into the normal world where nothing seems the same anymore and the only thing keeping him sane is his family. the heart break comes at the very end when we find out about Chris Kyle's sad tragic end. My favorite part comes where we Chris at a garage after his last deployment in which he and his team rescue some marines after a intense battle and Chris meets a marine he saved. Chris is in a garage with his son getting his car fixed. The sweet bit was the interaction between Cooper and the boy playing his son that was realistic but the icing on the cake was when he meets a man he saved and his reaction to the man as he tells the boy your dad is a hero thank you for lending him to us . That part choked me up quite a bit because I am a father. and I know how hard it was for Kyle to go to war with a small family. The battle with PSTD is simply the most authentic I have ever seen and you realize just how much the war changed him. And as he realizes it. And struggles to come back to be Chris Kyle the man and the husband and father. was this a perfect movie no far from it. but it was maybe the best war movie I have seen in a long long time.,Null,15,34,2 February 2015
Rocky II," Creed VS Balboa SUPERFIGHT II
",ROCKY II is that rare sequel that not only continues from the ending of the first. But improves on the story as it goes along. Stallone not only writes but directs and he does a stellar job. After the first fight The fighters are rushed to the hospital. Tha fans cheer Rocky and the press hound both of them. Apollo realizes that Rocky had done the impossible and gone the distance with him. This angers him and prompts him to challenge Rocky to a rematch in the hospital. Rocky refuses saying he's retired. After leaving the hospital rocky and Adrian are married. and Rocky is asked to do commercials. except Rocky has a bad eye. and can't read properly which leads to him getting fired. After having a spending frenzy The fight money is all gone. Leaving Rocky and Adrian to get Jobs. Adrian is back at the pet shop and Rocky now works for mickey. times are tough. But Love gets them thru. Adrian is expecting a baby and for Rocky life seems good. he gets a job at Shamrock meats only to be laid off. As for Apollo. he can't let go. He gets hate mail from irate fans thinking he carried Rocky or he was paid off to let Rocky go the distance. Apollo Has a burning need to prove to the world that Rocky had been a freak accident a lucky bum. and that not only can he destroy him he will. Apollo begins a war of words designed to bring Rocky back into the ring. And it has the desired effect. Rocky broke and hungry agrees to go back one more time. except Adrian isn't happy. She doesn't want him fighting. and because of this Rocky's mind isn't on his training. and he's not focused. Unhappy that Adrian is unhappy and that he let down the most important person in the world to him. When Adrian has the baby a month prematurely and is in a coma Rocky is in despair. He doubts himself and is full of worry for Adrian. until she comes out of the coma and tells him to win. Rocky trains hard and this time stuns the world by beating Apollo and becoming the NEW Heavyweight Champion.The writing is top notch. Stallone has infused these characters with so much personality they actually feel like real people. the writing is top notch and it was done before it became a clichÃ©d genre all by itself. The Story is typical Hollywood magic. And Stallone makes it feel special. And it is. ROCKY II is the last really pure Rocky picture in the series because after this Rocky moves further away from what really made him and his friends truly special. ROCKY II is like a little slice of life with some really good friends. and a great time is had by all.,Null,1,1,14 June 2016
The Revenant," the Long Crawl of Hugh Glass.
",In 1823 a mountain man Named Hugh Glass was attacked by a bear. Glass was near death when the party he had been scouting for abandoned him. Glass did not die and spent six hard weeks crawling to fort Kiowa. Glass had been attacked in the middle of summer by the time he reached the fort it had turned to Fall. Glass survived and found the men that had left him and forgave them.That is the real Story of Hugh Glass. That being said. Hollywood adapted the wonderfully written novel by Michael Punke and turned Hugh Glass into a 1800's version of Rambo. The Revenant Takes the Story of Hugh Glass and shakes it up a lot. By giving him a son and a Indian wife that is killed by a ruthless Army officer. And his son is murdered by a cowardly trapper. Glass did not have a family.The film is beautifully shot. And the story is very engaging and pulls you in from the first shot. Leo finally got his Oscar for this movie and he deserved it as his was the best performance I've seen this year. It's a story basically of love loss revenge and redemption and it's beautifully told. The Story flows at a even pace and never falters. And for that it helps the film immensely. The question is Can this movie hold up under repeated viewings ? that is left to the person . Me personally I think it might hold up years from now But will it hold up to be called a classic ? the same way Casablanca and the Searchers are I think so. After all the film does show the harshness of life back then And the Mentality of the settlers and the Indians And it does so in such a stark brutal way that it's almost impossible to look away.A movie that is Very beautifully made and well written that deserves to be seen at least once.,10,1,4,28 May 2016
Bridge of Spies," This is how you do it..
",Bridge of spies is based on a true historical event. When Rudolph Abel is caught sending secrets to the Soviet Union and is found out to be a spy Abel needed a lawyer and when no one came forward to do it. One lawyer named James Donovan was appointed. Donovan formerly a criminal lawyer and had served at the Nazi war trials had settled down and became a Insurance lawyer. Donovan doesn't want it. But it becomes clear to him that the case has already been tried and Abel found guilty in a court of public opinion. Donovan decides to do his best to win by any means Legal. This makes him a target in many quarters and unpopular. In an age where anti communist feelings ran high. The case was done in a highly illegal manner and Abel found guilty. Donovan however found a way to save Abel's life by suggesting that he may be useful in the future if say a American Spy had been caught. In this Donovan was smart and foretelling the future because that is what happened. Francis Gary Powers and A young medical student are captured as spies Powers for his failed U2 flight in which he got caught shot down and Pryor for being on the wrong side of the Berlin wall. the U.S. Government wanting to secure the release of both men but not seem involved ask Donovan to work for them but Publicly Donovan works for himself his mission get Powers home. Donovan finds out about Pryor and is determined that Both men come home. Donovan is on his own. no gadgets no tools no back up a lot of handlers watching him and giving him orders which he ignores some he takes seriously but over all he refuses to give up on Powers of Pryor. both men he insists are innocent and are coming home. Alone in a strange country not speaking the language and scared Donovan does the impossible. And that is the movie in every bit of glory. This humble man that would never think of himself as a hero is one. And this man who does the impossible wants one thing to go home and get rid of his cold.This just may be the best spy movie to come out of the last 35 years . and it also is tom Hanks best. Mark Rylance shines as Abel the unworried spy who becomes a pillar of strength to Donovan in the darkest points of the trial. You're not worried Donovan asks him and his reply is a classic No should I be ? would it help if I was ?These are the things movie gold is made of.,10,1,2,25 August 2016
The Shining," Welcome to the Overlook hotel. you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave.
","Stanley Kubrick's Version of the Shining butchers Stephen King's fantastic novel. by stretching it in other ways and omitting important plot points and adding others and making changes to the Overlook itself and how the Torrance family reacts to the Hotel.That said. however Kubrick's version of the Shining is a outstanding and highly original look at King's novel. Which King hates. but Kubrick was a gifted director who knew what he was doing and he was a perfectionist which drove the cast and crew of this movie crazy. but Kubrick never lost sight of the story he wanted to tell. in the novel King explains that the Overlook is a large psychic vampire a large battery feeding off of the people there who had Psychic abilities . Making the Overlook a large battery that stores and contains the most emotional psychic moments of its existence. Happiness ,Death,Love , violence. all of these things go on and on in the Overlook . but in Kubrick's nothing about the Overlook is explained except in the barest of details .but that is more then enough. Here in the movie less is more. And while the Shining is Kubrick's movie it belongs to Jack Nicholson. while in the book the slide into madness is supposed to be subtle for Jack Torrance. In this movie he seems cheese and crackers right from the start which is fun to watch as you realize the cheese has slid off his crackers and he is dangerous . The best bit is the scene that leads to the staircase. Wendy stop swinging the bat Wendy..as he moves in to kill her in a moment of comic timing. Nicholson makes the movie his own. Jack is dangerous he is now a maniac bent of killing his family. But he has a sense of humor about it. which makes it creepy.To me the part that keeps me up at night while thinking about it is only hinted at. When we are told Delbert Grady went crazy and killed his family with a ax. And stacked them neatly in one of the rooms of the west wing like cord wood. and then shoots himself. In the novel Grady kills himself long after his family he kills himself by shotgun because he has broken his leg falling down the stairs . To me the most horror filled moment is when you think about the little girls being killed by a ax. while one little girl looks on and sees her sister being killed by her father and knowing she is next. Does she run ? does she hide ? can you imagine the horror she must have felt knowing her sister was being chopped to pieces by their father and their mother was already dead. and she was next. That's the one point in the movie that gets me every time and with every viewing. That's how you know its a great movie. film making of the finest kind. And after seeing that and letting your imagination run wild with little scenes like the one I described . You can forgive Kubrick for his butchering King's novel because he did what he sets out to do. Telling King's story from a different view point. And scaring the daylights out of us . Its a great classic and deserves to be !",Null,1,2,26 October 2015
Rocky IV," Then where do we go from here Stallion cause we sure as hell can't be born again.
",Rocky IV should be titled ROCKY THE AVENGER.It's themes are simply technology VS human achievement Man VS machine. And the main theme politics/ Or Rather us VS Them. The USA VS Russia. Stallone as gifted a writer as always writes a compelling story. About the three themes and adds a fourth. what happens to the old warriors ? The old Champions ? where do they go after the fight is over ? To me Rocky IV is a mixed bag. A great movie to watch nicely packaged and done with style. but it's also the one that Takes Rocky the furthest away from the core of what Rocky is.When the Russians toss their hat into the boxing ring The world takes notice they even offer to challenge Rocky to a exhibition bout but Rocky declines. Apollo Creed however has his own ideas about that. five years retired. Apollo misses the spotlight the adoration of the crowds. Apollo feels old out of date and worse of all he feels forgotten. Ivan Drago is the Russian Boxing Champion. he's huge strong and a walking billboard for better health thru science. The two men could not be further apart. The Russians are looking for a top contender. And Apollo asks Rocky to help him. 'Please Rocky I'm asking you as a friend. Please stand by me one more time.' Rocky agree to train Apollo. the fight becomes a bloodbath and Apollo is killed in the ring. after the Russians are leaving the USA. And Rocky has challenged Drago the Russians agree except the match Must be held in Russia. Rocky has a fight with Adrian. She tells him he can't win. Rocky just can't turn his back on this. He had watched his best friend get murdered by a Russian killing machine. And Rocky has a desire to bring him down. Stallone once said that he ran out of ideas for the movie that explains the long training scenes.The fight itself is Very good as Rocky battles Drago. a Modern David VS Goliath match. Rocky wins the big match. And the end speech is right out of the 80's when Hollywood felt they had to get political every now and then. Not bad as far as entertainment goes and I find myself still watching it even after all theses years. the Worst in the Rocky series. but still overall on it's own a damn good movie.,Null,1,1,16 June 2016
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America VS Iron man right VS wrong.
","CAPTAIN America :CIVIL WAR Is a great movie. fine acting all around. and a solid story. People are going to think this is a retelling of the Cap Vs Iron man comic book event civil war. It is not. there are similarities in the comics The Super heroes are forced to a Registration cat that forces anyone that has powers to become a government agent if you refuse they go to jail. This is done after a hero VS Bad guy conflict goes wrong and destroys a city. Cap refused to sign and Tony headed it up. Both sides did not see the wrong in their actions. The Comics took a matter of three years to resolve the aftermath of the civil war. In a series a great to less then great story arcs. This movie does not have that privilege. The story here in the movie is more or less Civil War MCU style. and it raises a lot of interesting questions.After a mission in which the Avengers are trying to stop the last of Hydra wrong. a building gets destroyed And The Scarlet witch is blamed. The Nations of the world unite to bring an accord against the Avengers the accord makes them a body under the control of the UN. Captain America disagrees. He likes having a free hand. And he does admit the actions of the Avengers has resulted in destruction of cities and loss of lives but the alternate would have been worse. 'The safest hands are still our own' Cap declares. but Tony and General Thunderbolt Ross disagree. Ross tells Cap the world owes them a huge unpayable debt but their is a percentage of the population is scared of them. they need to be reined in. Cap is scared of being turned into a weapon and being sent to places they might not want to go instead of going to places that they might need to go. then Bucky Barnes as the winter soldier reappears and complicates matter for Captain America. And once again Cap chooses right over wrong after the Avengers are ordered to being him in, But Cap finds out there is more to this then even Tony and his Avengers even knew. And it doesn't always come down to right or wrong but in loyalties and the courage of your convictions.The film is a great entry in the Captain America series but not as good as winter soldier. In looking at the movie in terms of right VS wrong for a movie that tries to show us the areas of gray. It tends to force the point. I found the villain Baron Zemo uninspired in comparing him to his comic book counter part. Zemo is simply wasted. As the Mandarin is in Iron Man III. A lot of potential ruined by a script that should have been so much more. but in what we were given the movie is more then enough. Spider-man in his first Marvel movie makes it special. tom Holland claims the role in such a way that Garfield and Mcguire never did.Of course the film ends on a sour note and in such a matter that you know it is going to be resolved in AVENGERS :INFINITY WAR or whatever the Russo's are going to call it.Civil war isn't perfect. but it delivers the goods .",10,8,18,10 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," something wicked this way comes
","The first conjuring was scary tense and original. It scared you when you least expected it and it scared you even when you expected it. the sequel However is the first time a horror movie ever gave me Goose bumps. Never has a movie ever given me goosebumps.Does that tell you something ? the direction is top rate and the acting is solid. The pacing is superb as the director lets the story unfold at it's own pace. Like the first movie. The conjuring 2 borrows from the real life case files of Ed and Lorraine Warren two real life Ghost hunters that had a knack for getting the truth out. The Film opens up in the famous Amityville Horror house and goes from that investigation which Lorraine said the evil in that house is as close to Hell as she ever wanted to get. Then the story moves to England and the house of a normal family named Hodgson and the stark horror that awaited them, The Enfield Haunting as it came to be known has the distinction of being one of the most documented cases in the area of the paranormal. Things occurred there that no one can explain. From Cops to Paranormal scientists no one could explain how it was done from scratching inside the walls to the Young girl named Janet being tortured and speaking in voices. Of course there is the people that tried hard to disprove it and only muddled the waters further. When the attacks intensify and the Catholic Church is brought into it the Church sends in Ed and Lorraine to investigate Not to get involved just observe. Lorraine is plagued by fear that if they do get involved it'll mean Ed's death. but from the moment they get there things escalate to the point that the warrens realize they can't just sit back and observe. there is danger here and Janet is targeted for death by the vengeful spirit.And so begins a struggle to find out just what it is they're dealing with a ghost Demon or hoax. That struggle is going to lead the warrens to the edge of despair and it might cost them dearly in the end.the Story is based on true events. But like the conjuring the conjuring 2 is based on the fact that the warrens investigated the haunting. they never solved it. They never had epic battles like the films suggested. but that's reality and we are looking for entertainment and as entertainment this is entertainment of the finest kind. Best money you'll ever spend at the movies this year. and best money you'll send renting or buying the DVD. In other Words Go see it.",10,38,76,12 June 2016
Room," a perfect tale of what happens After !
",ROOM much like its title is a perfect self contained story. The acting is simply flawless. and the story Chilling. The Kidnap and rape of a 17 year old girl held captive for seven years.

A stunning film and it hits every rung on the emotional ladder. And most of the credit must go to Bree Larson. Her acting is nothing short of compelling and believing that She really is Joy. A fast tight direction. the director kept a tight rein on it and steers it to where the story needs to go. this just may be one of the greatest films Holly wood has done in the last 35 years.,Null,0,2,16 July 2016
The Imitation Game," Sometimes the people no one imagines,Comes great things no one can ever imagine.
",the Imitation Game is one of those movies that surprises you and impresses you. It also has the ability to educate you about things you never knew. Or things you never learned in school. When I was in high School my science Teacher's idol was Alan Turing. He kept talking about the Turing machines and we learned about Alan Turing briefly. 30 years later I've forgotten about Alan Turing. Which is a shame because his life story really is a fascinating one. Alan Turing was a unequaled genius at codes and machines built to think . When he went to Bletchely park to get a job breaking the enigma code. Turing did not think too highly of the War. What he wanted was the challenge of smashing enigma. Turing was too great of a genius to let that code remain unbroken for long. the film details how hard life was for him. alone and with few friends.It details greatly how Turing was . And when the war ended and the team dissolved Turing turned his attentions to more machines that would work miracles. Until a break in accidentally leads to Turing's greatest secret revealed. his homosexuality. In a era where that was a Crime Alan Turing was arrested and charged with indecency. And this led to his suicide at the age of 41. The movie is powerful. subtle in ways you do not see coming. and truthful. Cumberbatch gives the performance of a lifetime and bring Alan Turing back to life . This isn't a war movie by any means . Its a movie about a lonely man struggling to find his way in the world. In a age where Autistic people where dismissed as retarded and homosexuals arrested. Alan Turing overcame all of that to become a hero and a icon for all the lonely people out there who do not fit in. Bravo to all involved with the making of this film. You have made a classic and a movie to be watched over and over .,Null,0,1,19 May 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Behold The Vision .
","AVENGERS : AGE OF ULTRON, is that rare movie in which the second movie surpasses the first in every way. Here Joss Whedon builds on the first Avengers movie and expands on it. Adding layers. The action is explosive and impressive. The Story is a beautiful love story to the Avengers 50 year history. The film opens with the Avengers smashing a HYDRA Base and regaining Loki's wand from the first one. When the Avengers throw a farewell party for Thor who plans to return the wand to Asgard. Tony Stark and Bruce Banner decide to examine it and see what makes it tick. They discover the wand has a mind of its own and use it to their Ultron protective program. a program designed to protect the world and usher in a era of peace Except, The AI sees things differently. It decides that the greatest threat to mankind is mankind. and The greatest threat to Ultron is the Avengers. The film moves at a break neck speed. The fights are mouth dropping. but that's not the only important thing here. There is a actual story that is buried underneath the action. a subtle story about man over relying on machines and the need for heroes. A major step up over the first one in every way. And Paul Bettany steals the film as The Vision a android conceived to be the ultimate weapon. And instead becomes one of the Avengers. Worth seeing more then once.",Null,0,4,18 May 2015
Selma," Nothing can stop the power of a dream if its strong enough .
",Selma is the epic story of Martin Luther King's March from Selma Alabama to the state capital of Montgomery. and all the problems he faced along the way. The Move does not white wash the truth . Times were that bad if you were black and living in the south. This movie makes you feel what it must have been like in the 60's in the south if you were black and while accepted only by whites as inferior. You were never given a reason to rise above that. When President Johnson signed the civil rights act of 54. King accused him of not going far enough. The blacks he argued were not being treated fairly and were still denied their basic rights as citizens.In order to highlight this King planned a march from Selma to Montgomery. a march that Governor George Wallace was determined to do everything to stop including murder . It took three tries and they had to fight a war first until the nation finally saw the sad conditions down south . but Martin Luther King had a dream. And nothing can stop the power of a dream if its strong enough. not even hate can do that.,Null,0,0,30 July 2015
Rocky," Nobody's ever gone the distance with Creed And if I do and I'm still standing.
",ROCKY was written in three days by Stallone . An Actor that didn't find employment too much his best roles were blink and you miss him in Woody Allen's Bananas and Robert Mitchum's shot at Phillip Marlowe in 75's Farewell my lovely. as well as Roger corman's death race 2000 as Machine Gun Joe Vitallo. Stallone wrote and starred in the Lords of Flatbush it launched a lot of careers but failed at the box office. Struggling Stallone wrote a novel and a screenplay for PARADISE ALLEY that he failed to sell then he went to the Bar to see Ali fight Chuck Wepner. Stallone became inspired. He only had 120 dollars in the bank. Inspired he wrote Rocky in a fever pitch during the course of three days. Stallone sold it but stipulated that he and only he play Rocky. A gutsy move that paid off. Rocky had the makings of a hit. The Studio didn't want Stallone as Rocky they wanted Burt Reynolds or Jon voight. but Stallone stood his ground and wonRocky is about a local club fighter Rocky balboa. rocky is broke and humble. he has a good heart loves people and tried to do his best.

Rocky III," go for It.
","Rocky III is a sleek shiny plastic cover. but that's a Good thing. it serves to prove a point. And that point is from the time Rocky became the Champion. his life turned from being about the streets. And being about one of the people to being a celebrity . Rocky hasn't sold out. He was swept up by all the fame and all the changes fame makes, More money bigger house more people knowing who you are. It feeds the Ego. And Rocky has quietly slipped into this trap, But Rocky is still fighting. Defending the Championship against ten fighters. Rocky has become a icon. the public loves him.

Rocky II was about not forgetting about what's the most important things in life are. while pursuing your dreams. Rocky III it's point is simple. Never forget who you are and never lose yourself in superficial things be honest to yourself at least.Stallone once said that Rocky III was about how fame changed him. and how people had changed around him it was as Stallone said very surreal. Like Alice falling down the Rabbit hole into Wonderland .And he captures that perfectly here. Creating a classic Rocky film that can easily take its place among the best. Someone Says Rocky and chances are you'll think of either the first Rocky but more likely you'll think of Rocky III and for good reason. It's unforgettable. and its a great time at the movies.",10,1,1,15 June 2016
The Untouchables," Eliot Ness and his small band of Untouchables.
",the Real life story of Eliot Ness reads like a adventure novel that ends on a tragic note.But it makes for a great movie. now granted Hollywood being Hollywood changed things around and added or subtracted many elements of the Real Untouchables. to start off with Eliot Ness became a prohibition agent because it was the law of the land. and he hated the wide spread corruption to him the law was the law a good law or a bad law to him it didn't matter it needed enforcing. When Ness was given the assignment to bring down Capone . he mentioned a idea of a flying squad composed of nine honest men. Ness never wanted to head it up. but the situation in Chicago was so desperate. that they never gave it any chance of success and appointed Ness the leader. and right away Ness and his men went to work attacking Capone from the streets while the Government worked at getting Capone from the business level of not paying taxes Both teams did their job very well. and Ness and his boys stole the headlines when one paper called them THE UNTOUCHABLES .When Hollywood decided to remake the classic Robert Stack Series . they went with a script that took all the truth out of it. Gone were the historical facts . There was never a older Chicago cop who mentored Ness and the other Untouchables. The Role of James Malone wonderfully played by Sean Connery is a work of fiction. And Connery steals the show as the street cop with a heart of gold turned Federal agent. The entire idea of going to the academy to get a young rookie to help would have been laughed at in the 30s. George Stone would have been seen as too big of a risk for dangerous work like this. But Depalma and Connery and Costner and Gracia make it work. And third the Governemnt never sent an accountant to Chicago to work at it from a street level. but Charles Martin Smith makes his Oscar Wallace work so well that you don't mind the historical mistake. And no member of the Untouchables was ever killed by Capone . Only one member of the Untouchables outside circle was killed as a warning. Frank Basile who was the driver for Eliot Ness and helped the Untouchables in their work that Paul Robsky one of the last Untouchables called Basile a unofficial Untouchable.But still all the inaccurate information aside. The Untouchables is as great as a epic movie that you could ever hope to find. Kevin Costner plays a very human and very moral man pushed into a unthinkable situation in which he must stop the beast by working outside the law. Sean Connery steals the Movie . his James Malone is the honest beat cop with a heart of gold who is simply after 20 years on the beat trying to stay alive. Malone is a widower. He knows too much and he keeps his mouth shut. Because saying anything to the wrong people could get him killed at a second's notice. It's Ness who gives him the courage to go out and stop the monster that's ruling Chicago.Robert De niro is in fine form in one of his greatest roles Ever. Mention Deniro and chances are the untouchables is the first second or third movie mentioned. And for good reason as well He oozes evil and madness as Capone. As well as Charm. the real life Capone was charming and Deniro shows us to how charming he could be.Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith fill out the rest of the Untouchables. and do grand work. The Story is solid and the climatic shoot out in the Train Station is a work of art. Brian De palma has every right to be proud of that scene. Its not overly long but its a complicated scene which must have been a nightmare to film. But it holds together so well.Historical real life aside. The Untouchables is as great as it gets .My only hope is that next time they decide to do one closer to the truth. but until then I'll enjoy this one.,10,4,5,29 March 2016
Whiplash," Where does Greatness come from ?
","Define Greatness ? almost everyone has a idea of who the 'Greats ' Are. In fact almost every body knows the back story of their great and who they are and how they came to be. But What is it what does it meant to be truly great ?Whiplash is a movie that struggles with that Very question. as it tells the story of Andrew a young man with a love and a driving passion for the drums. his idol is Buddy Rich and he lives for jazz. he studied Charlie Parker and simply lives to play.The most telling part takes place at a dinner party where Andrew is belittled by his family, for having a lack of friends. And Andrew Retorts that he would much rather live and die like Charlie Parker then to live Like them. When Andrew is reminded that Charlie Parker died alone and friendless with a arm full of heroin He relies that at least Charlie Parker is Remembered. And not only is Parker remembered but he is now a immortal legend. And that would be fine for him. Andrew is driven to be one of the greats .then he is selected by his university's leading music teacher a jazz musician named Terrence Fletcher.. Fletcher is as driven as Andrew is. Fletcher lives and dreams in terms of music and his one driving goal is to discover the next Charlie Parker the next Buddy Rich. And in doing so he will push Andrew to the breaking point. he will drive him to limits he never knew he possessed. and both of them will end up on a collision course with madness.Whiplash is a study in passion and the drive to be great. And what it takes to be great. Its also a study in fear. the fear of what would happen if yo failed achieving what you wanted to be great at.I was first made aware of Whiplash during the Oscars and saw the stunning footage of J.K. Simmons and I thought to myself I must see this movie . Simmons alone makes it great. the story is engaging and makes you think and its easily one of the best films to come along in a long long time that did not depend on explosions or super heroes like the Imitation game this films greatness lies in its very humanity.",10,2,4,3 June 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Where do old comic book superheroes go to die ?
","BIRDMAN Is a unique movie. And as a result it stands out from the other movies it was nominated with. Birdman simply seems to shine brighter when compared to other movies of its year. It's closest competition wold be the superb The Imitation Game. Birdman is a study in madness loss regret and failure. While struggling to redeem oneself by risking it all.Riggen Thomson is a washed up actor who is only known for playing the comic book superhero Birdman. Thomson played birdman in 3 highly successful classic movies and then lost himself to the game of fame. He quiet birdman after the third movie came out and slowly faded from public view. As he says during the Movie 'I'm a answer to a trivial pursuit question 'He struggles to make a comeback this time on stage on Broadway tackling Raymond carver's classic story what we talk about,when we talk about love. At first glance it seems like chaos. Thomson is broke one of his actors can't act and the publicity is not there. The rehearsals are not working and Thomson is starting to hear Birdman speak to him.When one of his actors is hurt. Thomson manages to replace him with a Broadway actor who is the darling of the media. the man is arrogant. A Trouble maker who finds disdain with every thing. Mike Shiner pushes Thomson to his breaking point as opening day comes close.The one constant in Thomson's chaotic life is the fact that f he said yes to birdman 4 he could write his own check. Thomson refuses to go back to a movie hero he gave up 24 years ago.Thomson wants to be seen as a actor/artist. but as the countdown comes down to the wire Thomson slowly starts to crack .Michael Keaton gives easily the single most greatest performance of his career. Emma Stone shows in this movie why she should be taken seriously now as a actress and not just given fluff roles. Stone is capable of giving great performances and this one is easily her best. Edward Norton gives a strong turn to a most unlikable person who actually ends up making you like him despite his ability to offend and insult those around him.Now that I have seen the most talked about films of last year and the ones nominated for best picture. I can honestly say birdman sparkles where other films glow. It has a certain feeling about it one that makes you want to watch it again while reaching for your copy of BATMAN 89. This film is Keaton's shining moment. I hope he has many more now that he's showed us what it is he can do. And I hope there is a Oscar waiting for him in the future.",Null,0,3,10 June 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The World's finest Team
",Batman Vs Superman Dawn of Justice is to me the best film of 2016. And perhaps like Man of Steel the most misunderstood. The film opens up as the attack on Metropolis is at its worst and Bruce Wayne arrives to see his office tower destroyed and his employees die. and injured. flash forward two years and Bruce Wayne is still as bitter. He's Forgotten what The Batman is supposed to have stood for. He's still doing the job but he's killing and torturing the criminals. And he's worried about Superman. He believes that one day Superman will turn on them and he must have a plan in place. When Superman rescues Lois Lane from a warlord in the Middle East Superman and Lois interfere in a CIA plot and people die. superman is blamed for those deaths. And its added to the destruction of Metropolis there is a senate hearing already in effect on the Superman problem. And there is the little matter of a mad man named Lex Luthor who is stirring the pot creating even greater trouble. Luthor has discovered a mineral that can kill Superman. He names it Kryptonite . The only problem is its rare. Things heat up when the capital building is destroyed and Superman is believed to be involved . Bruce Wayne finds out there are others like Superman and that Luthor has files on them. And when he tries to steal them he meets a Wonder woman named Diana Prince.the movie comes together in a big finale that is action packed energetic and wonderfully filmed. And it sets up The Justice League nicelyThe reason the movie is misunderstood is this. Batman does not kill That is wrong he does and he has killed in the comics The Martha scene. Again pretty much like the Tornado scene in Man of Steel people fail to realize that there is actually something going on inside the character's head .Martha is a word that acts as a trigger and to me that's the most realistic scene in the movie.There are other things but Synder is aiming for a realistic take and he succeeds. People compare this so much to Christopher Reeve and his movies or Adam West / Christian Bale or the comics and fail to see that this movie has nothing at all to do with any of those.This is a stand alone movie not having any ties to the other versions of Superman and Batman it's its own Earth .To me the film works because when you look at it. how else would a Superman or a Batman be precievced by the public except as Gods and Monsters .,10,8,11,1 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars Episode Seven from the adventures of Luke Skywalker
",Star Wars Episode Seven from the Adventures of Luke Skywalker. THE FORCE AWAKENS .When George Lucas first imagined Star Wars he created a trilogy that would form a saga. But as he continued to write he imagined Star Wars being a Serial like Flash Gordon. And he fleshed it out From Episode One :The Phantom menace Episode two : The Attack of the Clones Episode Three The Revenge of the Sith Episode Four : A New Hope Episode five : The Empire Strikes back Episode six : The Return of the Jedi . Lucas planned more but when Disney bought Lucasfilms they intended to tell the story their way. The Story still has The scent of Lucas in it. But that's faint. here JJ Abrams takes the story and runs with it and adds a story that makes the series proud. Its 30 years after the fall of the Empire. Han Solo and Leia have a child together . Luke Skywalker attempts to train the new Jedi Knights and the Republic is restored. then Some thing happens . A new organization calling itself the First order pulls together the remaining factions of the Empire into a military power bent on destroying the Republic and to pick up where the Empire left off. And they are ruthless. Throughout the years Han and Leia's son Ben is trained to be a Jedi Knight and falls victim to the dark side. setting off a chain of events. The first Order begins a cruel march on the galaxy to destroy the republic. And anew resistance rises up and new heroes emerge to battle the evil of the First Order.Luke Skywalker has vanished and The First order begins a search for him. A search that will awaken the Force.It felt good again to see my childhood heroes and to see the always beautiful Millennium Falcon the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.the movie is almost flawless and its not just a retelling of episode 4 Its a whole new story meant to move the series forward. And it does. Kaylo Ren is a formidable Villain and he is the bridge from the old to the new. Rey is a incredible new heroine . she's a fighter a pilot and she's a heir to the force. Rey gives us our first look at the future of the series. Its a big Galaxy and there is more to it then Han Luke and Leia . I didn't like the note the movie ended on. But I am eager to see more of the new guys Finn and Rey . As they team up with the old guys to fight the bad guys . This movie does justice to my childhood. And it made me for a second want to be a kid again and to see this thru a kid's eyes . this movie is a gift to Star Wars fans everywhere. and to all of us who love to see heroics and derring do on a epic scale.,10,3,44,16 January 2016
Deadpool," The Merc With a mouth now in his own movie.
",DEADPOOL is one of those great achievements in movies. It won't win any Oscars. But it will win cash lots of it. And it'll be well remembered as one of the best films of its time because its Fun. Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool. His delivery and comedic timing is superb. And he makes it clear. This is not a superhero movie. Deadpool is not a superhero. He's a merc for hire. he's paid to kill people. Itjust so happens that Deapool has a reason to have a conscience. He's got s soft spot for the little guy. Wade Wilson is a Mercenary who is hired out for work killing people. But He finds love with the lovely Vanessa and he feels like his life is now complete. He has love. He also has Cancer in the lungs prostrate and brain. So in order to extend his life he submits to a shady operation designed to cure him. What they want is another weapon. The operation is cruel its inhumane and its designed to create stress to activate Wade's mutant healing powers thanks to a mixture of a serum laced with Wolverine's blood. During this stress Wade becomes disfigured. And he escapes vowing to kill the people who did this to him. He's immortal but in pain. He's also got a grasp on the world few others don't. He can break the fourth wall. And he is literally insane as well. Deadpool's sense of humor tends to move towards the black parts of life. But he is funny. That sick sense of humor is what makes the movie. The story takes a turn for the worst when the thugs kidnap Vanessa and force Deadpool to come to them. With the help of Two of the X-men Deadpool goes into battle determined to kill and maim the bad guys . That's it the story in a nutshell.The Story works because of Reynolds. He is Deadpool he waited ten years to make this movie. And that was time well spent because they made a movie that is one of the best in the superhero/comic book genre. It does not take itself seriously. And avoids the clichés . Deadpool has to be seen on a movie screen to be appreciated. And watch it without kids . This is not a movie for the little ones.,10,4,15,27 February 2016

Braddock's fighting career almost came to a halt when he broke his right hand more then once and suffered career ending defeats. by the time 1933 came Braddock like many others struggled to find work and found it on the docks. With his boxing career basically over And Work hard to find Braddock held onto his pride and refused to go on government relief. There are others worse off he often said. By the end of 33 Braddock was broken to the point where he had no choice but to go on Government relief and Braddock swore to pay them back. Soon after Braddock was given a match a last minute replacement match against Corn Griffin a top ranked contender for the heavyweight Championship.

Braddock entered the underdog and no one gave him a chance. Then James J. Braddock made history by knocking out Max Baer for the Title. True to his vow Braddock paid back the relief money. And held on to the Championship for two years until he lost it to Joe Louis .Ron Howard's Telling of the Braddock Legend is an excellent example of how to tell a story. First off Russell Crowe captures the shy nature of Braddock a honest man caught in try times that made good people Evil. that is driven home when you see the conditions in which they live . And when his oldest child steals to put food on the table and Braddock makes him return the meat. That is the finest scene in the movie. The acting is so pure and you are caught up in it . The Struggles they face and the bravery they had to have. The movie itself is a time machine that lets us peer into a window and see just how terrible the depression was and how it killed people in one way or the other. And how one man gave them hope and became their Champion.,10,1,2,11 January 2016
