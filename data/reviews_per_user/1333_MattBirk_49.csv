The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A Completely Unnecessary Film
","Mockingjay Part 1 feels like nothing more than a cash grab on behalf of the studios behind the film. The movie moves at a snails pace (which would have been okay if it had strong writing to back it up), but nothing original seems to surface. The movie focuses on turning Katniss into the face of the revolution, but what was she before this then? Did we really need a whole movie showing us what we already knew was going to happen, whether or not she was going to accept such a role? The movie moved away from originality, which is what made The Hunger Games so fascinating and into a territory we have seen done before.Mockingjay Part 1 adds nothing to the story which we didn't already know, we knew Katniss would be the symbol of the people (wasn't she already?), we know President Snow is a ruthless dictator, and we know revolution is happening, everything that happens in the movie we already know. I guess the one thing we didn't fully know was the fate of those left behind, but that surely does not justify this two hour movie. On the other hand, the movie does pack a solid amount of emotion into the two hours, we saw the extent of the evil the capital is willing to take just to stay in power.But besides that, the story is not nearly strong enough to justify splitting the final book into two separate movies. Mockingjay Part 1 is all about propaganda, but that is exactly what the movie itself is, propaganda, trying to persuade us to see Part 2.",4,2,4,2 August 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," An amazing mystery thriller, undermined by its ending
","I'll get this out of the way early, I firmly believe using the word 'Cloverfield' in the title was solely to sell tickets. There was no real need to draw comparison to 2008's Cloverfield. This movie could have been its own thing (and it probably would have been better for it).As for this movie, it's pretty damn great! John Goodman is fantastic here, he's already got the body size to scare any sensible human being but his acting is certainly on point. He is a walking, talking, tension radiating, thug. At any single moment he can snap and the movie plays with this notion a lot! And to balance that out, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the likable, vulnerable damsel in distress if you will. Together the make a great duo for a very, very engrossing cat and mouse game.Outside the praise of Goodman, it is the script that shines. There are some serious 'oh my god' moments that take things to the next level. Just when you think everything has been solved, the movie throws you another curveball to keep you guessing. Once the first 'bomb' (not literally) is dropped, the movie goes from a mild thriller to a bone-shaking puzzler. It's at this point of no return that the movie is most enjoyable as we watch the characters piece together their situation and we just sit back and watch the mayhem take over. I hope I'm not over-selling anything but the movie really does keep you on your toes!10 Cloverfield Lane really came out of nowhere and that's always nice to see. It's certainly reminiscent of Joel Edgarton's The Gift. Not story wise, but both are a directorial debut featuring a mystery/thriller narrative. And they both received good reviews and critic response (eerily similar scores if you really break it down). It's really a pleasure to have modest expectations for a film, only to be blown away. This is one of those films, as long as you go into the movie knowing it's only a 'blood relative' to Cloverfield and nothing more.",8,0,2,11 March 2016
Child 44," Wasted Potential
","The main problem with Child 44 is the narrative is split into two stories. On one hand, it's the serial killer mystery (the one the trailer promised) and the other is the Russian government hunting down Tom Hardy's character (the one the trailer kept hidden). The problem being the serial killer storyline is hardly established/relevant to the movie, and the other storyline gets too much attention. From what the trailer gives us about the movie, I expected a tense mystery thriller with a pretty frightening story (a killer running rampant in Russia).Instead, the movie skimps over this story by basically using it as a backdrop for the other story of Tom Hardy's accent vs Russia. And when we finally come to a close as to who and why the killer does what he does, it makes little to no sense and couldn't be more disappointing. And before you know it that plot point is over and we're back to Tom Hardy dodging the back MGB.And like I said, the serial killer mystery is second string while the government/spy story is the main force. And that's too bad because this story just isn't at all interesting, especially when you keep waiting for the other story to take over. To put it simply, there was just too much going on for the movie to make it thrilling. The movie is based on a book and like a lot of adaptations, the book didn't translate well to film.Do not go into this movie expecting it to be anything like the (pretty damn great) trailer, Child 44 is flat out too long and extremely short on thrills. There is almost no tension to speak of (certainly none involving the serial killer storyline). Maybe I went into the movie expecting something different and that could be my fault, but what was put on screen was nothing short of disappointing. It's unfortunate, but this type of story had so much potential and completely falls flat.",4,1,5,25 August 2015
Fury," Decent War Movie with Brad Pitt
","David Ayer creates what is probably the best war movie of 2014. Fury is a gritty look at the life of a group of men confined in a single tank and their struggle for survival. Clearly a crazy life and for just about anyone it would be a very difficult life to have, but these few men make it work. Brad Pitt is definitely the highlight of the film, bring not only his men together but the garrison of other tanks during battle. While together in the tank they are a solid, fighting unit worthy of your admiration, but outside the tank 3/5 men are complete fools and it's hard to look past how obnoxious they are. So we are left with only 2 men, the new member, and Don, but Don shows his true colors when he executes an unarmed man (I completely lost faith in his character after that scene). And then the kid, unfortunately, doesn't receive enough backstory to make him seem like the 'innocence' character they want him to be portrayed as. Also, the movie would have been far more effective if it didn't go all out crazy with its climax, becoming too over the top for its own good. But outside of these flaws, the movie feels authentic and real in a sense and totally shows the horrors of war. But in the end, the movie will probably just be remembered as 'that tank movie with Brad Pitt'.",7,3,6,17 March 2016
Akira," Not only a great Anime, but a fantastic Sci-Fi Film as well
","Based on reputation alone, I expected quite a bit from Akira, and I have to say it mostly lived up to its reputation. I say mostly because I was led to believe this movie had battles similar to Dragonball Z (superpowered characters facing off against one another), but that certainly is not the case here. I guess I was expecting a bit more 1v1 battles between espers (those with psychic abilities), but instead, the movie had a deeper story to tell. Akira is a brash and dark film that takes place in a dystopian future where the government is struggling to keep secret the evolution of mankind. The concept alone was enough to hook me in and using animation was the perfect medium for this type of story to fully flourish.Everything in the movie was unique to say the least, from an animation standpoint to its bizarre conclusion. If you go into this movie thinking it will be nothing more than action or your typical 'strange' anime, you will be quite surprised at how much detail goes into the story itself. There are a ton of ideas floating around (albeit a bit too many to fully understand most of the time) but the important ones are developed quite nicely. But those larger ideas that they choose to focus on really do thrive thanks to the animation, which as I said, know no bounds except the imagination of its creator. The only downside seemed to be most of what occurs in the first half of the movie seems a tad irrelevant in the end. It was as if the creators were trying to throw in too many ideas from the manga into the movie and it became a bit convoluted. But that is where the whole idea of rewatching the movie comes into play, Akira makes a bit more sense having seen where the story goes in the end. That way, as the movie progresses you can follow what exactly characters mean when talking about past events that occurred which we are given very little detail about.But the main driving force behind Akira (for me) had to be the idea of unleashing the supremely powerful Akira. Knowing that he was powerful enough to release the energy equivalent of a hydrogen bomb was enough to suck me in for the entire runtime. It was this idea that made the movie interesting if not nerve-wracking because we don't exactly know what kind of a person Akira is, is he good or bad? Will he save the world or choose to destroy? It was this type of trepidation building throughout the entire movie which lead to the final climax of the film that worked for the most part. I have to admit, I wasn't expecting the type of ending the movie had, at first I was disappointed with how everything ended up, but as time went by, I kept thinking more and more about the ending. And eventually came to the conclusion that the ending was justified. It not only leaves the viewer in awe but more importantly, it leaves a very strong lasting impression.Looking back on the film, the actual storyline of the movie is a bit more interesting to me than what was put on film (possibly meaning the manga would be something I should look into). While I didn't necessarily love the movie like I thought I would, mostly because it seemed to have pacing issues (at least the first hour of the film), the story itself was right up my alley. That being said, I would gladly watch the second half of the movie because that's where the action picks up, the telekinesis starts to appear, the characters start coming together, and the movie dives deep into hardcore science-fiction. Assuming you have no problem with anime and can buy into the idea of telekinesis, Akira is something everyone should see based on the impact it had within the film industry.",8,1,3,27 July 2015
The Maze Runner," One of the Worst Endings in Movie History?
","Another dystopian movie with children being put through hell for 'the greater good'? No thank you. The movie raises far more questions than it answers and to make things worse, it demands you return for a sequel for 'potential' answers. Other notable movies like 'The Lord of the Rings', 'The Hunger Games', 'Harry Potter' leave questions between films, BUT they don't start a million new questions in the closing minutes of the movie, they all had some sort of closure. Aside from all the unanswered questions, most of the excitement comes from the mystery of the maze, but it is unfortunately overshadowed by the annoying struggle between the inhabitants. The fact that the inhabitants are given a CHOICE to either run the maze or stay and live their lives trapped takes away any sense of urgency. They should be all trying to solve the maze and a way out, but instead they are docile, submissive characters, accepting defeat. Characters on 'LOST' and 'Lord of the Flies' are FORCED to build a society because they have no other alternative, unlike 'The Maze Runner'. Katniss in 'The Hunger Games' is FORCED to kill and survive, which makes the movie more tense and exciting, which yet again makes 'The Maze Runner' feel less appealing. Characters in 'The Maze Runner' have the ability to potentially solve their captivity, but they basically chose not to, where's the excitement in that? In the end, the movie unfortunately solves the mystery of the maze (bittersweet in a sense) and now tells us that phase two has begun, which makes the entire movie now seem completely pointless. The driving force of the movie is the maze and now that that mystery has been solved, the future installments feel completely thin without such an obstacle based on these characters.Full Review at: http://www.simplefilmreviews.com/2014/09/the-maze-runner-2014.html",4,2,5,24 September 2014
Green Room," ''Green Room'' Cuts to the Bone!
","Some movies have over-the-top violence (The Evil Dead), some have excessive violence (Inside), and some have realistic violence, that's 'Green Room'. Following up the out-of-nowhere hit 'Blue Ruin', Saulnier returns with another tension-fueled story with crazy-realistic violence that cuts to the bone. This may not have a complex story like 'Blue Ruin', but it's definitely a step up in terms of tension and trepidation.'Green Room' isn't just the type of movie that has violence for the sake of violence, this movie earns the violence. It's doled out in small short bursts, but those small bursts are incredibly potent and shocking. Every bit a carnage shown on screen is earned.Not only does the movie present the audience with the obvious fear of death (specifically by mauling) but it also presents us with the fear of a real, competent antagonist. Patrick Stewart's character is menacing without ever doling out any violence himself, he's smart, calculating, and manipulative. It's not often you see movies where the bad guys actually outsmart the heroes multiple times. And that's the real fear factor here, a formidable bad guy.The downside of 'Green Room' are the thin characters who receive little-to-no development. I wish we were shown a bit more interactions among the band members to reinforce our emotional connection with them.Outside of the weak characters, there are plenty of obstacles the characters must go up against which only makes the movie all the more exciting. Saulnier knows exactly what he is doing and creates a ton of tension, which more than makes up for the lack of a complex story.This is one of the years must see thrillers!",8,4,13,15 May 2016
The Babadook," Best Horror Movie of 2014
","The Babadook has to be one of the best directorial debuts of all time, it's simply amazing to watch the amount of skill involved in the movie with no previous experience. This is the sort of movie that focuses on a strong story which is built on a very strong emotional foundation, which is most likely why critics are praising the film. This certainly is not your typical monster movie, it's much more deep and intellectual than that, and that is why I enjoyed it so much. There are no straightforward answers, everything is left to the viewer for interpretation. I have to admit I was expecting a different type of movie, something that featured a mysterious monster wreaking havoc inside the house walls (based on the trailer for the film), but was still not disappointed (I've been waiting for this movie for over a year!). The Babadook focuses on the relationship between a mother and her son, it's not your straightforward loving relationship either, it's much more complicated & wretched than that. I can't go too much more in depth than that without giving away too much of how the movie plays out. A lot of people have labeled this 'the scariest movie of all time', which of course immediately raises peoples expectations and when that happens, almost never will a movie live up to that title. However, the movie is absolutely scary, Jennifer Kent knows just how to manipulate the darkness in the frame and only shows us part of the villain and lets our imaginations do the rest. Plus on a technical level, I think the design of Mister Babadook is amazing, he couldn't be more intimidating, especially since we only see the outline of his true form. Nothing in the movie comes 'easy', it's almost all up for us to decide and I think that is the brilliance of the movie, everything in the movie represents some sort of a metaphor. The Babadook is easily the best horror movie of the year (given It Follows comes out in 2015), and marks the start of a very promising career for Jennifer Kent.Full Review at - www.simplefilmreviews.com",9,10,22,2 December 2014
Finding Nemo," One of the Best Animated Movies of All Time
","Finding Nemo is Pixar's crown jewel and one of the best animated movies of all time! They create an entire world under water, it looks beautiful, but it also captures the scarier things below the surface. Together, Dory and Marlin travel the Atlantic ocean in search for Nemo and along they way they run into some of the most bizarre characters imaginable! The audience is in the same position as Marlin, he is exploring the ocean for the first time, just like us as the audience, and it is intoxicating. The ocean to most people is a giant, wonderland full of mystery and you never know what you will run into, and Pixar takes full advantage of that as we meet a variety of characters. Along the way, we are given the treat of having some amazing comedy bits as characters cultures clash amongst one another. But even as we travel across the ocean and back, the core of the story never leaves us, it's a love story about a father and son and it is an emotional roller-coaster. They brilliantly take the most notorious fish movie, Jaws (which made the ocean seem terrifying), and turns it upside down, making the water now seem like a wonderful land full of amazing creatures. Finding Nemo is the epitome of Pixar's imagination and creative abilities, they have made an eternal classic here.Let's hope the sequel lives up to the first film!",10,1,2,17 March 2016
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino Brings Us a Dialog Driven Mystery
","First we had the character-drama Slow West, then the horror-western Bone Tomahawk, and finally Tarantino's The Hateful Eight. This one being the most 'grand' in scale and certainly the most well put together. This is one of the year's better movies which is a nice mix of western justice and cabin fever. You can easily see the influence The Thing (my favorite movie) had on this movie (which Tarantino had the crew watch before making the film).There is a lot to like here from strong characters to dark cynical humor, everything you expect from a Tarantino movie. The introductions are a tad slow, but once you hear everyone's story you then can start to piece together who is lying and who is telling the truth. And the action this time around is nice and swift verses other stories where violence is more of a storyteller (Kill Bill). This is what makes The Hateful Eight so foreboding, once you realize how swift the action is it really antes up the tension. Not to mention the dialog carries a lot of the weight, we get to see the characters analyze other characters based on their responses to certain situations. Which is bittersweet in my eyes, I personally would have liked more physical puzzles/clues, but with Tarantino, the puzzles are hidden within the dialog.Which brings me to my main gripe with the movie, the mystery the story presents us with. It's engrossing and intriguing but, unfortunately, too brief. The Hateful Eight builds up this idea about someone not being who they claim to be and then in an instant we are given the solution to the mystery. Just when things start to get interesting as to who killed who, boom, resolution (to the mystery, not the movie itself). The movie should have played out a bit more like Clue or Gone Girl, keeping us guessing while presenting new clues as the mystery builds to its apex. But here it is all too brief. That's not to say it ruined the movie, what we are given is still juicy enough to keep you entertained most of the time, it just could have been a bit more of a guessing game when all is said and done.Though I did like the movie quite a bit and would place it in the middle of Tarantino's filmography, I have to admit I was slightly let down. That, of course, being because I expected more of a one-by-one-they-all-die mystery. But that sure as hell didn't ruin the movie. It's fun, intriguing, and, of course, over-the-top violent when the script calls for it.",6,11,46,31 December 2015
Interstellar," Top 10 Movie of 2014....But Not The Best
","I cannot remember the last time I've been this split about a movie, the way I am with 'Interstellar'. The movie features a general plot that I absolutely love, Earth is dying and Earth's remaining survivors must send people in search for a new planet to save mankind. I've always been fascinated by space and I love how Nolan explores the unknown, such as far off galaxies, wormholes, blackholes, and gravity. The brilliance is that he is basically free to do whatever he wants with them since hardly anything is known about such anomalies. Time was at the center of the movie, it was the driving force for the main character and it was intriguing to see how time manipulated people's motives, its a force you cannot fight and win against. But on the other end of the spectrum, with a movie like this, you open up a door to a plethora of questions, which happens to be the case. There are moments where the movie just forces you to assume something with very little explanation (especially characters motives for doing certain acts). The movie also beats you over the head with constant talk about gravity and relativity, as if the entire audience had a PhD in physics. That was a huge drawback for the film, it relied so heavily on those concepts that it was hard to follow or understand as they went from one idea to the next with little explanation. You know when you have a real life physicist on the set explaining such topics to you, that the audience might be left behind scratching their heads. As for the acting department, the movie was surprisingly tame, outside of Matthew Mcconaughey, no one stood out, they just did their jobs and that was the end of it. Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, and Michael Caine were all fine, but certainly nothing to brag about. As for the ending, I still have mixed feelings about it, I really wanted a huge 'No way!' curveball thrown at me, but instead we got an overly explained ending that we knew would tie into the beginning of the film. But it was sort of bittersweet in a sense and I kind of enjoy that type of thing. But again, not enough can be said about the general ideas Nolan wanted to put on screen, they were ambitious and very intriguing to think about post film. I'm glad someone took a chance on such complicated and sought after ideas, even if they came up short (we surely will not be seeing something of this caliber in a very long time). Best movie of 2014?........sadly no. That title belongs to 'Gone Girl' or 'Snowpiercer'Full Review at : www.simplefilmreviews.com",8,0,3,9 November 2014
American Sniper," The Cost of War
","I have to admit I went into the movie expecting more of a documentary type story than a biopic/action drama. That being said, American Sniper in my eyes was a safe attempt of a controversial person that could have been something much deeper. The movie paints him as the Superman of our armed forces (which is probably true) and slowly shows the toll the war has on his personal and professional life. It's a sad story no doubt, seeing even the mightiest of heroes affected by PTSD and the cost of war, but at the same time the movie shies away from the overall impact it has. We are only shown glimpses of his personal life and each time it gets worse and worse, but this is where the movie made the mistake, it shows too much action versus not enough of his personal life. We can easily see his professional career is very decorated and impressive, the movie boasts more than enough action to make him look like the hero he is, but the movie moves away from his personal life which is where we could have really got up close and personal.Though the movie is quite fictitious from what I have read, the acting and general story are quite impressive. American Sniper is sure to be a crowd pleaser (already has a Cinemascore of 'A+'), it's a good war movie with an interesting lead, but the movie doesn't go deep enough on a personal level and tackle the numerous controversial moments of his life.",5,1,12,18 January 2015
Southpaw," About as Generic as a Boxing Movie could be!
","This will be short, Southpaw is about as straightforward as you would expect from a boxing movie. A once great fighter falls into despair only to be given another chance at redemption in some sort of title fight. This movie hit just about every single plot point you would expect it to. And that's what makes Southpaw feel so dull and unengaging, it holds too few surprises. He gets beaten down again and again only to find redemption later in the movie just as expected. This is the type of movie where if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie, period!But to no surprise, however, Jake Gyllenhaal is the saving grace of the movie (the 5/10 score would certainly be lower if he had not been in this movie). He is physically committed (looks like a complete beast), but is also able to bring the necessary emotional state the character required. If he had not been in the movie, this would have been a complete disaster. He totally fit the role of the down on his luck boxer, but more importantly hit the role of the damaged father even better. And even though we know exactly what is coming to our 'hero', the performance by Gyllenhaal makes it seem a tad more enjoyable.At the end of the day, you've seen a ton of movies like Southpaw. You could probably predict the ending of the story based on the trailers alone. Even though Jake Gyllenhaal gives it his all, the movie can't help but fail because of the extremely generic script.Instead, go watch The Wrestler again!",5,54,89,24 July 2015
Nightcrawler," Slapping our Media Obsessed Society in the Face!
","Nightcrawler is a brilliant movie with a strong premise that is led by a standout performance from Jake Gyllenhaal. I cannot stress enough the impact and intensity from Jake Gyllenhaal, his character Lou is terrifying, but not in a directly violent way, but in a way that he will stop at nothing to achieve his goals no matter what the obstacle. He is manipulative and in a sense, a genius, and that is what makes him so frightening, he's the smartest guy in the room. I loved watching him start small and then climb his way to the top by using people who are nothing more than pawns in his grand scheme of things. Aside from Lou, the plot in general is genius, it speaks volumes about today's society and our obsession with violence and media. It basically portrays the media as attention whores who will do anything for a leading story and television ratings. They lack morals & compassion, and exploit people at their most vulnerable. An industry perfectly fit for the cold and emotionless Lou, who is willing to take things one step further. But even with all these shining aspects from the film, there is one glowing problem, its abrupt ending. It wrapped up too neat and quick, it could have been either a happy ending or a dark ending for all I care, but something that would have featured more substance and story. It left the viewer with more questions and story to be told, but instead it chose to skip over all that and move on (taking the easy way out in a sense). The movie is 117 minutes long, which certainly isn't 'long', but it could have added an additional 30 minutes of story for a solid conclusion and I would have had no problem with that. But when all is said and done, Nightcrawler is one of the best movies of the year, regardless of its shortcomings. Jake Gyllenhaal has come a very long way and I absolutely love the roles he has been taking recently (especially this one in particular), hopefully he receives an Oscar nomination!Full Review at : www.simplefilmreviews.com",9,1,3,4 November 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Perfection
","Peter Jackson has created a modern day masterpiece that will surely stand the test of time and be labeled one of the great fantasy movies of all time. He has created a world that feels very real and in it, he puts some of the most authentic characters who makes the movie flourish. The use of practical effects is what makes the movie shine, the production design in the movie is perfect, everything looks authentic and magical, it's great to see him shy away from CGI when possible. The movie slowly reveals the diversity of Middle Earth and every new scene brings new wonders, it's astonishing to see the world unfold before our eyes.Fellowship is also the most personal and heartfelt of the three, seeing the Fellowship weaken and fall apart as the movie is devastating. Though the battles and storyline are the smallest and least 'epic' when compared to the second and third movies, the emotional impact here is the greatest. This is why the movie is the best of the three, the stakes are high for the group of people we care about, we just get to meet them and already they are falling apart. The character interactions between the original Fellowship is the best aspect of the movie, together there are no more than nine characters, but they are given the greatest task of Middle Earth. Not to mention to great comedy bits that take place between the hobbits and the other members of the group (the later movies move away from the comedic tones).The Lord of The Rings is easy one of the great trilogies of all time, they are all must-see movies!

28 Weeks Later," One of the better Horror Sequels out there!
","28 Weeks Later is a solid follow up to the both critically acclaimed and popular, 28 Days Later. I have to admit that I'm not very fond of the zombie genre, having felt I've seen just about everything they have to offer to the point where it's all quite similar in a sense, but 28 Weeks Later thankfully had a few surprises. The sad part is the movie gets progressively worse as the minutes roll by, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. The opening scene is great, a nice, calm setting is turned upside down on a moments notice by the most ferocious and aggressive zombies ever shown on film. Of course this can't be stated enough, the zombies in this series are by far the worst kind you could go up against; insanely fast, smart, and driven not by hunger, but by pure rage. This is probably the most appealing aspect of the series, even in small numbers they are a force to be reckoned with! But once you get past the great opening and set up, you are left with another run of the mill zombie survival movie where the characters are just traveling the apocalyptic roads with no real end in sight. It then concludes in a near pitch black tunnel, which makes no sense to me why they would choose to have the climax shot like that, nothing but disappointment there. But when comparing the two movies in the series, it's obvious the original film is the better of the two, it's well written and dark, aided by its political and social commentary. 28 Weeks Later on the other hand is more of your average, action heavy, gruesome killing sequel with a higher kill count and larger budget.",7,2,4,24 February 2015
The Thing," Best MOVIE (Not Just Horror) of All Time
","One of the greatest movies of all time, my personal favorite movie in any genre! John Carpenter created a masterpiece that stands as the crown jewel in the horror genre! Great acting, thick atmosphere, brilliant effects, and smart character decisions are just some of the things 'The Thing' offers. Speaking of the characters, this is one of the aspects where the movie stands apart from the rest, they make logical decisions for the greater good of the group. They aren't splitting up, going to into dark rooms alone, they are fighting back and using science to their advantage. Outside of strong characters, the movies special effects are unrivaled even by today's technological advancements and widening resources. The practical effects used in the movie look spectacular, over the top yes, but never too fake to the point where they become silly. The creatures many taking forms could not look any more impressive or scary! This is the standard that all horror movies should be judged, from its foreboding atmosphere, to special effects, and strong characters, this is the crown jewel in the horror department!Full Review at : http://www.simplefilmreviews.com/2014/05/the-thing-1982.html",10,0,2,1 October 2014
The Revenant," A Story so Intense that it would make Bear Gyrlls' Compassionate!
","The Revenant may be marketed as a revenge-thriller, but it's really about Hugh Glass (Leo) vs nature. Nearly the entire movie is about Glass battling Mother Earth and struggling to survive the night. And I gotta say it was both breathtaking and stressful. Day after day seeing him struggle with simple tasks and knowing the insane journey he has in front of him is taxing. The amount of punishment the man goes through is enough to make Bear Grylls compassionate.Some people might try to water this one down and say it is nothing more than a revenge flick. That may be true to some extent, but it is more to the movie than just that. It's a man vs nature and his struggle to survive for one last cause (that cause obviously being revenge). There is also a message about white men vs Indians that can't be ignored. It's something we have seen before, yes, but it doesn't make it any less sorrowful or profound.The middle of the film does get a tad repetitive as we watch Leo struggle for shelter and fight the cold again and again. This would be a major drawback if the movie didn't look this beautiful (fingers crossed for a Best Cinematography Oscar). The location mixed with the camera work seems to make the cold jump off screen. The movie might not have hundreds of characters, large-scale battles, or fantasy-like elements, but this truly is an epic.I can see how a lot of people might be turned off by the movie (a huge chunk of the movie his Glass literally wandering the wilderness day and night), I still stand by my statement that it's one of the year's best and deserves to be seen on the big screen!",9,15,38,8 January 2016
The Hills Have Eyes," A Great Action-Horror Movie (and One of the Best Horror Remakes)
","This is a review of the unrated version of the movie (the one not shown in theaters). According to sources, the unrated version has around 60 +/- seconds of addition footage (mostly violent content). Thought I'd share that tidbit in case anyone was curious!While many might have stopped reading by now because of the amount of high violent content, I have to admit I was entertained throughout the vast majority of the movie. It all sort of stems from how well you can sympathize with those being tormented. I personally found the family dynamics totally worked, siblings acted bittersweet to one another, the father was dead on (arrogant and the man with a plan), and together they felt real. Even if at times some of them were unlikable they still felt like the typical squad. Put them in a very tense situation by Mr. Aja and you have a fast-paced mutant thriller.This is an action-horror movie plan and simple. Characters fight against the mutants multiple times, they make traps, traps go off, chases ensue, one-on-one fight scenes, and many more aspects that make this an action type movie. There is little suspense to mention outside of first few scenes were the mutants move unnoticed. That being said, it was a pretty enjoyable film (as long as you can handle the violence) because of how fast paced the movie is. And by fast paced I mean once the carnage starts and the mutants make their presences known, the movie doesn't let up till the final image. This is a movie that creates its scares by visuals, from the grotesque looking mutants to the over the top gore displayed on the screen. So for me, the movie wasn't scary at all.So are you going to find this movie on a list of best horror movies of the past XX-amount years? Probably not, mostly because the movie substitutes suspense for gnarly imagery and in your face violence (which a lot of people aren't down with). That's not to say the movie is bad, but Aja (director) knows what he was going for with this one and who his target audience is (gore hounds). The Hills Have Eyes was created for those people who want visual stimuli and unrelenting violence, and the movie succeeds as such.",7,2,5,3 March 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," A Classic Summer Blockbuster!
","I'll get this out of the way early, Tom Cruise is one of the best actors in Hollywood. He is easily the most passionate about the quality of his work and it absolutely shows. And the Mission Impossible franchise is where he is able to perform at his best and craziest. Over the years he has done some out of control stunts, a knife millimeters from his eyeball, free hand rock climbing, scaling Burj Khalifa, and holding his breath for six minutes just to capture real life thrills for the audience. How can you dispute or not appreciate this in today's CGI heavy world? Tom Cruise is great.Looking at Rogue Nation, the movie features everything you have come to love from the franchise, outlandish action sequences, real stunts, great humor, and over the top hacking abilities. Everything is put together in perfect fashion and carried by a great cast. This time around Simon Pegg gets a lot more screen time which is always a plus because he is flat out hilarious. We also get a bit of background on Ethan Hunt the character which is interesting and helps drive the story. But the standout feature of the movie had to be Rebecca Ferguson, she played her part perfectly and when the story needed her to be a badass, she was more than capable. That of which is surprising because I know quite a few people (including myself) were disappointed seeing Paula Patton not returning to the franchise after Ghost Protocol. But Rebecca was a wonderful surprise, and possibly better than Patton, hopefully she returns for the next installment! Outside of that, this is the type of movie you go into expecting over the top action sequences and elaborate heists and the movie delivers on both fronts. It's a fun ride with a sound story and great characters (honestly I was glad to see Jeremy Renner take a smaller role this time around in order for Simon Pegg to get more screen time).Rogue Nation might not have the strong thematic undertones and production design of Mad Max: Fury Road, but it does have some of the best action sequences of the year. This is the epitome of the classic action summer blockbuster that the public has come to love. Great acting, real stunts, and plenty of humor makes Rogue Nation one of the best action movies of the year (and possibly the past decade). This might be the only franchise in the world where it seems like the franchise isn't slowing down and each entry is a great stand-alone movie!",7,3,7,1 August 2015
Captain America: Civil War," The Best MCU Movie to Date
","Just when you thought they couldn't make a better movie than The Avengers, the Russo brothers go and make something like this. The idea of Civil War is tricky, pitting friends against one another all the while they try to remain 'the good guys'. You might be questioning why the would turn on one another, but the script actually provides some sound reasoning per character. Guilt (and a bit of revenge) consumes those who wish to sign the accords and limit their impunity, while those opposing feel the politics behind it won't solve a thing. Captain America: Civil War (aka The Avengers 2.5) might just be the best MCU movie to date (I'm sure the general public will label it as such). While that may be up in the air, it without a doubt features the best action sequence of the entire franchise, the airport scene. Not only does it feature some new unseen heroes fighting for the first time, but it also features ample amount of humor (mostly thanks to Spiderman). It is the highlight of the movie and actually the highlight of the franchise so far. But again, the main fault in my eyes (as usual) is that we are still treading water on a cosmic level. Thanos and his minions are still plotting their schemes and have yet to make their presence known to the Avengers. I'm still hopeful to get more screen time away from Earth and get the feeling the entire universe is in peril. One can only hope.As a whole though, Civil War is a fantastic blockbuster. It features more avengers than any movie to date and gives us plenty of action pieces to make the two hour and 30 minutes run-time fly by.",8,2,6,7 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," Same Creepy Atmosphere but Ruined by another Derivative Story
","The Conjuring 2 is a mixed bag of a movie. It has some unquestionable scary scenes but it also has a ton of unnecessary jump scares where the volume goes from whisper quite to jet engine loud. I'm sure the average Joe or teenager will eat them up and proclaim the movie to be a horror classic, but to me it's not scares that makes a horror movie great. That being said, if you are someone that doesn't mind jump scares, you will most likely eat this movie up!A lot of the good ideas and moments from the first film are present here in the sequel, the likable Warrens, a standout scare scene (the painting scene), plenty of raising tension, and an eerie score. The problem, however, is that it's all dragged out over the course of two hours and ten minutes. That leaves plenty of time for boredom to set in and room for those less engaging moments (or should I say numerous, cheap jump scare scenes). It seems as though the executives or producers of the movie wanted Wan to through in as many scares as possible, ignoring pacing and runtime. Which leads to many scenes being unnecessarily long and plenty of throw away jump scares.Not only are some scare scenes tepid, but some are flat out cheesy. Anytime the girl is possessed and the evil, old man 'speaks' it's damn near laughable. Mostly because 'a man's voice coming out of a little girl' isn't anything new nor is it haunting. When all's said and done, The Conjuring 2 has the same eerie atmosphere from the first film that made it enjoyable, but also the generic storyline that plagued the first film. Amplify that story with an unbearable two hour plus runtime and you get, in my opinion, a failed sequel (even if it does have some scary scenes).",5,1,10,11 June 2016
Inside Out," Pixar returns to being the King of Animation!
","Fans can rejoice, Inside Out is the return to former glory for Pixar. This time, Pixar makes up the long absence with an ingenious idea about how the interworkings of a child's mind comes to be. The humor is great (though quite a bit is geared more towards children) and the emotional notes, of course, drive the movie. Pixar not only tells us what is important to an eleven-year-old, but they also show us why it is important.The movie really explores the odd mood swings of young adult and how all emotions are more or less unbalanced. A child is unpredictable and irrational and all of that is shown here in spades, Joy tries to remain in control, but all the other emotions fight for the spotlight. And that is part of the brilliance of Inside Out, we see how zany a child's mind can be when compared to the rational mind of an adult (who shares the controls with other emotions equally). Not only are we shown the importance of emotions, but we see the interworkings of a child's mind, from the importance of friends and family to an imaginary friend. Pixar leaves no stone unturned, everything you could imagine about the brain/mind is explored in great detail. And that is what makes the movie so magical, we have never seen something like this before. Imagination Land, long term vs short term memory, dream productions, subconscious, and so much more shine bright here. It's a marvel to see the entire 'world' within the mind played out in front of us.Inside Out will easily win the Best Animated Film Oscar this year (if not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture) and go down as the return of Pixar being the King of animation. It has everything we have come to love about Pixar films, it's funny for both kids and adults and hits an emotional cord for people of all ages. Though, this isn't the best Pixar film to date (not even in my top five), but it is certainly their most clever and imaginative yet!",8,3,24,19 June 2015
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," This isn't your Father's type of Western, and that's a Good Thing!
","You might think the title of the movie spoils the entire ride with its spoil heavy title, well I'm here to tell you you'd be dead wrong. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is one of the most thought-provoking films I've seen in a very long time. Not because the story is puzzling or complex, but rather because it gives us a different perspective than one might think based off the title. This is not a movie about Jesse James, instead, it is a drama that explores Robert Ford's relationship with Jesse before the assassination and the fallout that comes from it.One thing is for certain, this isn't your fathers type of western. There are no wild shootouts, horse chases, elaborate bank robberies, or even a hero for that matter. This is a tale of one character's rise to infamy through another character's downfall. Put bluntly, the movie is more of an epilogue than anything else. The movie is primarily told from Robert Ford's perspective which only makes things that much more poignant about the entire situation. We see the impact meeting the real Jesse James has on him and how his ideas of him become warped over time and what that means for the fate of both men. From Robert idolizing Jesse, to him thinking he is 'just a human being'.It's not easy to see who is a hero and who isn't, those lines are intentionally blurred. The beginning of the film clearly makes the case for Robert Ford being an over the top obsessive fan of Jesse James, which points him out to be the 'bad guy' as the title suggests. But as time goes by the director moves away from this notion and starts to build up the idea that Robert Ford as acting not out of pure cowardice, but perhaps out of self-defense, or so Jesse will have him believe. It's this vague line that makes the movie so intriguing, who truly was playing who? But at the same time, there is also the idea of self-promotion at play. This is an opportunity for Robert to achieve the stardom he has always wanted. Finally, Robert Ford has been given his chance at fame, but certainly not the type of fame he was looking for.The beauty comes at the end of the film when we are shown the final years of Robert's life now having to live with the fateful decision. He is given fame but at the cost of torment and public ridicule for killing a beloved figure. Interesting enough is that we don't truly see what the public thinks of Jesse James till he is gone. He is seen as a celebrity by many, but the entire movie leading up to this point keeps this aspect hidden from the viewer. As if Robert Ford himself simply believed he could replace the man himself, simply take his fame and make it his own and no one would know. It's beautifully structured so that as the movie progresses you start to actually sympathize with Robert more and more right up to the bitter end. Yes, he may have been a creepy sociopath to begin with but as his suffering unfolds before our eyes it's hard not to pity the man. The brilliance truly stems from focusing on Robert over Jesse.And as for the soundtrack, it's spectacular and more importantly moving. It helps paint the 'wild west' as a slow moving and sorrowful place, where heroes are born but also where they will eventually die. This score mixed with the stunning cinematography, which at times obscures the image, create a perfect dreamlike tone (as if the whole movie is some sort of fantasy of Roberts').I can easily say this is one of my favorite western movies ever made. It's subtle, beautiful, and moving. And as I said above, the movie is rather slow (especially the first half) but the ending is more than rewarding. It leaves you emotionally conflicted, feeling sorrow for the so-called 'coward' of the story.",10,3,4,22 December 2015
It Follows," One of the Best Horror Movies of the Millennium!
","I just want to get this out of the way, I've been patiently waiting for It Follows since Cannes 2014 and have never been more excited for a single movie in my entire life! My expectations were through the roof, I of course had read to praise from critics all over the world saying 'It Follows is one of the best horror movies of the decade'. Which of course is very high praise (the same was said about last year's The Babadook, which I found to be true, it was also one of my favorite movies of the year), but does this year's It Follows live up to the title of being labeled one of the best horror movies of the millennium? Yes, no question about it! It Follows is the embodiment of tension and anxiety that we so rarely see in movies these days. Mitchell has created a perfect atmosphere full of dread, but more importantly he is able to create a nightmare with a dreamlike quality. The camera work is what helps make this idea flourish, wide angled shots mixed with slow panning shots revealing the monster lurking in the background. It Follows gets points for being terrifyingly original and creating a new nightmare where at all times you are never truly safe.And of course enough cannot be said about the general idea of sex and what it stands for. In the movie sex is used as the tool to pass to curse from one person to another. Obviously symbolizing that sex can kill (literally), but at the same time having sex is also seen as liberating (you free yourself by passing it onto another person). This is what makes It Follows so interesting, interrupting what the monster itself represents and witnessing how different people handle said curse. The females in the film handle the situation completely different from their male counterparts. The males try to pass the curse off as fast as possible and with little remorse, whereas the females seem to feel more guilty about passing it along and struggle with their new found nightmare. Without rambling on about the subtextual layer of the movie, just know that the movie is just as creepy as it sounds. Outside of that, the high point of the film has to be the original score by Disasterpeace, it's one of the best horror soundtracks in decades! The music is what makes the movie tick, it plays over the vast majority of the film and it is played very loudly to help squeeze out the most tension possible from each scene. With a killer soundtrack, fantastic cinematography, and a terrifying premise, It Follows is easily worthy of being labeled a future horror classic!",9,85,169,28 March 2015
Gone Girl," 'I Did Not Kill My Wife'
","David Fincher has taken another fantastic novel and turned it into an engrossing spectacle. The movie may be long (nearly 2 hours and 30 minutes), but not for one single second does the excitement leave you and boredom sets in. Fincher keeps the suspense high throughout the entire movie, just when you think the movie has been solved, new obstacles arise and it couldn't be more engrossing!The first half of the movie obviously focuses on the mystery of 'Where his Nick's Wife?', but it isn't until we figure out if she is alive or dead that the real excitement kicks in. That being said, the second half of the movie focuses on Nick and his colleagues trying to figure out a way out of the mess he is now in, thanks to new evidence, this is where the movie gets wild. Unfortunately, he is always one step behind the true monster and it's exciting to see him attempting to counter and disprove 'the perfect crime' and whether or not he will come out on top. The movie starts off as simple mystery thriller and then explodes into a much larger story with plenty of intricate layers to keep you guessing at the end game; and it also challenges you as viewer and forces you to pick a side (the lesser of two evils perhaps). Of course much of the praise must go to the author of the actual book, because she has created a truly captivating story. As of right now, it is safe to say that 'Gone Girl' is the second best movie in 2014, second only to 'Snowpiercer'. This is a must see for anyone looking for a fantastic mystery movie with some of the best acting of the year!

The Mist," One of the Best Creature Features of the 21st Century
","A movie with more than one nightmare occurring at the same time, The Mist demonstrates that humans are just as brutal as the monsters that stalk us. I have to admit that this movie was a challenge to watch, not because of copious amounts of gore (which it doesn't have), but because of the religious lady who made their situation so much worse than it already was. She slowly starts unraveling the band of survivors with her constant monologues about God and the rapture, and how blood must be spilled in order for them to survive. Her character was so over the top, that she has to be considered one of the most annoying and difficult characters in movie history. But that may just be the genius behind the movie, focusing on the many people turn to religion in times of crisis no matter how ludicrous it may seem and then pitting them against rational thinking characters. This type of social and religious commentary makes the movie work on multiple levels and helps the movie avoid becoming just another creature feature with a large body count and CGI overkill.The Mist mainly focuses on the characters trapped inside the store and their tale of survival, not from the monsters outside, but the people on the inside tearing them apart internally. But don't get me wrong, there are plenty of crazy monsters lurking in the mist and we get to see plenty of them throughout the movie, and they are terrifying! The abilities or traits that certain creatures possess are terrifying, all sorts of nightmares are out there just waiting for them. This was an interesting movie, entertaining, yes, but also challenging because the movie tries to have smart characters front and center, but they are held back by not so smart characters. And I of course need not to discuss the ending, it's already been written down in movie history as one of the most shocking endings ever. The Mist certainly is one of the better horror movies of the 21st century!",8,4,7,13 March 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Not Terrible but not that good...
","Though I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me, but I find this sequel to be slightly superior to the first, mostly because the love story between Peter and Gwen and a standout villain, Electro. The character development was rich, the action was far better, and the movie 'somewhat' moves away from the horribly overdone origin storyline. The movie gives us more insight into his internal struggle between finding his path as a person and his responsibility as a superhero. That is where the phenomenal chemistry between Stone and Garfield comes into play, they are so believable it's incredible (just might be the best love story in the comic book film genre). But Amazing 2 does have plenty of faults, most notably it focuses a ton of time on Harry Osborn and in the final climax of the film we get to see him shine......for like 10 minutes (what a waste). All that build up and no payoff.The movie also carries over the dreaded parent plot line just like the original 3 Sam Raimi films which have completely been beaten dry. I don't understand why they keep attaching this sub-storyline to each film, they want it to be more important than it should be. The only redeeming quality of the film has the be Jamie Foxx's Electro, a standout villain who sadly is not given enough screen time.There are far better comic book movies out there!",5,2,5,17 March 2016
Ex Machina," A Future Sci-Fi Classic
","Ex Machina is easily one of the greatest movies to ever tackle the ideas of artificial intelligence. Everything about the movie is put together in an elegant and intelligent way, the movie tackles the ideas in a mature way. There are no elaborate human vs machine fight scenes or military overlord presence, instead Machina focuses on the ethical questions that come from 'creating life'. And though the premise might sound unoriginal or derivative, it's when they mix in the idea of sexuality that the movie becomes something different.From the moment, we arrive at Caleb's estate something seems very off-putting, he clearly is hiding something. And for the entire movie, as we explore his compound things slowly get more off-putting and stirring before boiling over during a wonderful climax. The deception between the two human characters is what makes the movie exciting, both men seem to be playing one another for unknown reasons. And as Nathan begins to understand more and more of what really is taking place in the house the tension rises and secrets unfold. Characters motives and beliefs are slowly unraveled and some seem more logical than others, but that's why the movie works, every character has sound reasons for their actions. The movie makes strong arguments for both sides of the A.I. equation.However, the movie might be too slow for most audience members, as I said this is a movie where ideas shine not action sequences. Not only do ideas shine, but the acting out of the three leads is incredible to say the least! But it's this move (moving away from action and letting ideas flourish) that makes Ex Machina shine and worthy of being labeled a future sci-fi classic!",9,193,296,25 April 2015
Evil Dead," A Solid Horror Remake that is V.I.O.L.E.N.T.
","Though Evil Dead has plenty of faults (the sounds the demons make are super lame), it is still one of the better remake/reboots out there (not sure if it's a reboot, considering that means it's becoming a series or spawning more sequels). The practical effects are fantastic and very brutal, they save the film from being another dismissive horror, gore- porn. But the movie doesn't feature any strong characters (like Ash from the original), it does its best to try and make Mia a formidable heroine (still doesn't work, however). That might be a problem with the movie right there, all the characters are quite bland.But perhaps its biggest downfall is that the movie goes for a more strictly horror approach instead of balancing the tone of the film between horror and comedy. The approach was clearly meant to be a more serious tone, but even that serious tone felt of quilter, maybe the movie would have benefited from a joke or two? So if you are looking for a horror movie with gore and lots of blood, this will definitely do, but if you want a horror movie with an actual storyline and atmosphere.....steer clear of this. Evil Dead is another unnecessary Hollywood remake of a beloved cult classic which only tarnishes the original's reputation!",6,1,3,17 March 2016
The Evil Dead," The Epitome of Cabin in the Woods Terror
","Sam Raimi has created a cult classic that has stood the test of time, The Evil Dead is a horror classic. The first of the three in Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy, The Evil Dead is campy, silly, and all around a gruesome thrill ride worthy of its cult status. It's hard to not admire the film, you can clearly tell what Raimi was going for, the limited budget and inexperience definitely shows, but that only adds to the overall charm of the film. A group of unsuspecting 20 something-year-olds unleash an ancient evil and have to fend off the foe for the sake of their souls. As the movie moves along, the tone goes from being creepy to downright chaotic as the demons taunt and torment the remaining survivors. It's hard not to laugh at the silly antics of the possessed, as well as the campy dialogue coming from most characters. But like I said, all of those silly aspects of the film only adds to the overall effect of the film, which couldn't be any more entertaining. The movie may be too campy for most people's taste, this is a movie that must be seen by any true horror fan or anyone who has a taste for extremely low budget films.It isn't until the sequel Evil Dead 2, which was made 6 years later that our hero Ash truly takes form, but this sets the stage for that. The Evil Dead may be over the top, unrelenting, and silly, but the movie is never dull nor entertaining! This is one of the best horror movies of all time, bar none!",9,1,2,2 August 2015
Jurassic World," Straight Forward Popcorn Fun
","Jurassic World is that classic summer blockbuster that we have come to love, high-concept fiction filled with spectacular special effects. It's one of those movies that you can't really hate, but you don't necessarily love. The graphics are great and the idea terrifying, so what more could you ask for from a movie about dinosaurs? There is plenty of action to go around and keep you involved and a variety of new dinosaur attractions to make the movie seem fresh. But that is not to say the movie didn't have problems, the story as a whole was average at best. But who goes into a movie about dinosaurs expecting a strong character driven thriller? There is not much to say here, this is a popcorn movie pure and simple and it exceeds as such.But the main reason holding the movie back from being considered great is that the trailers show just about everything the movie has to offer. From the trailers alone we see the Indominus Rex close up, tame raptors, the gyro-spheres, the mosasaurus (the giant alligator dinosaur), the pteranodon attacking from the sky, and the creators confirming if the tyrannosaurus rex would be in the film or not. The movie left hardly any surprises in the actual movie to make it something special. Not to mention the overall story being extremely predictable, from the downfall of the Indominus Rex, to Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard character's relationship with one another. Jurassic World is about as straightforward as you could expect.While Jurassic World isn't the best action movie of the year, it's still quite incredible and breathtaking because of the science both behind the camera (CGI) and in-front of the camera (the park design and the Indominus Rex). It's a fun movie that certainly has its faults, mostly thanks to the marketing team, but there is still something satisfying about watching dinosaurs destroy everything in their path.",6,6,18,13 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," One of the Better MCU Movies out there!
","In short, the long-awaited Avengers: Age of Ultron delivered us more or less the what we've come to expect from the MCU. Fantastic action pieces along with witty banter, to only be brought down by familiar villain characteristics. But that's not to say the movie was bad by any stretch, it was one hell of an entertaining ride and one of Marvel's best films to date. Everything from the first film was carried over and to new heights; action sequences, villain screen time, character banter, and expanded knowledge of the universe are all given more screen time. I can't see a sound reason die hard fans of the MCU would be disappointed here.The only major problem with the movie is, of course, its villain Ultron. His powers, to no surprise, have been dulled down significantly and he is now a jokester of sorts. He wasn't nearly as menacing as the trailers made him out to be. At any given moment, he throws out a one liner for no real reason, so many in fact that it becomes near tiresome. But the core of the problem has to be Ultron's plans are nothing we haven't seen before. Another villain trying to end humanity as we know it and the Avengers are nipping at his heels the whole movie. They were actually too close to his heels the whole movie, in fact, they were prevailing for too much of the movie.The only person to actually 'hurt' the Avengers was Scarlet Witch, and she switches sides, which leaves Ultron all alone. And by all alone I mean Vibranium Ultron and hundreds of easily disposable mini Ultrons. Only to be brought down in a predictable fashion and surprisingly easy fashion. It seems like the Marvel executives are saving the real destruction for future movies and Thanos, which makes these movies seem almost like place holders.But on a high note, the movie is far more action-packed than its predecessor. Not only are the action scenes better than the first film, but we actually get to see the numerous powers from all of the superheroes. Scarlet Witch's telekinesis, The Vision's density manipulation, Thor's lightning possession, and, of course, a ton of smashing from the Hulk. It's hard to argue the movie isn't entertaining as hell! Is this the comic book movie to end all comic book movies? Not even close but it's still pretty damn awesome!",6,1,6,2 May 2015
Selma," An Eye Opening Experience
","'Selma' is a good movie about a great human being. I'll admit I didn't know much about the actual events, so the movie was quite interesting. The movie focuses on a pivotal moment during the Civil Rights Movement, which focuses on Martin Luther King Jr. trying to march through Selma to Montgomery. Selma is told with with a solid amount of emotion, the events the movie portrays really gets your blood boiling because of how arrogant and hateful people could be back then. This is a powerful movie about a powerful individual who united thousands of people for one great cause and the movie itself truly captures the spirit of Dr King very well. The acting is of course phenomenal, some of the best of the year, especially when you hear David O's natural voice!But what really held 'Selma' back was the whole LBJ storyline and how they made him out as more of a bad buy more than anything else. After the movie I went and read about the events and a lot of other people out there agree (or were upset) about how the directed made him look. He was actually the one who gave MLK the idea to go to Selma and protest there, not Dr King. He also was a very strong supporter of the Civil Rights Movement and was constantly (but secretly) working on solving the situation on a legislative level. So if you are looking for a more factual movie about the events that took place, look for a documentary rather than this. Don't get me wrong, this is an eye opening movie, but it does have it's weaknesses, particularly the portrayal of LBJ and Dr King's personal life storyline, which is quite brief and doesn't really add much to the story. Outside of those complaints, the movie sends a very strong message and a great one at that. Is this movie the Best Picture of the year? No, it's a good movie with a heart at the center of the story, but it lacks to energy and gut punching ability that '12 Years a Slave' had last year to make it truly something special.",8,4,12,13 January 2015
The Descent," Strong Characters and a Terrifying Story!
","One of the best modern day horror movies ever made, as well as one of the best-reviewed horror movie of the decade. The tension is high, the characters are strong, and the atmosphere is nice and thick, The Descent does just about everything right. Of all the 'isolation' horror movies being made, this is hands down the crown jewel! The production designs of the cave system look fantastic, they were all man made of course, but it gave them room to create some truly frightening scenarios.As I said before, the real highlight of The Descent comes from the group tension between the women and their history together, which just happens to hit a rough patch during this time of crisis in the cave. They're forced to work together, even though previous drama has surfaced creating some very thick tension amongst the group. Plus, there is something else about having an all-female cast that makes the movie a bit more harrowing and interesting, probably because when you think of violence, you typically think of men committing the violence or being violently killed. But that being said, the woman certainly are up for the challenge, and the movie just would not have worked with men in this type of situation.And as a final note, the ending of The Descent is simple, yet brilliant (from what I have read, most people were expecting more), it's actually one of my personal favorite horror movie endings!",8,2,4,2 August 2015
The Witch," This is a Movie about Faith, not a Witch (You've been warned!)
","The Witch is one of those films where heading into the movie you sort of need to know what you are getting into. This IS NOT a movie about a witch, it's about a family's faith being tested and the fallout that follows...all the while a witch lurks in the woods nearby.The Witch is being touted as a movie with pure, unrelenting dread. While that is the case at times, the atmosphere dwindles during the many times the characters repent. And they repent an awful, awful lot. I understand that the movie is about a family's faith being torn apart from within, but the movie's 'entertainment value' dips during some of those scenes. The tension is killed the moment they start bickering and doubting one another. It's just as one might expect, however, the Devil (evil) is a whisper in your ear which creates doubt with one's faith. And that is just what The Witch is, it's a whisper of evil. There are swift, small build ups that tease there is evil afoot, but just when you expect something sinister to occur, nothing. The hare, the goat, the raven (all heavy symbolism of Satanism) are all present. But they are used ineffectively half the time that they feel like child's play (literally at times) rather than signs of their forthcoming damnation.I really wanted to like this movie more than I actually did and that's a pity. A case can be made that the hype got the best of me, but I was just as hyped (if not more) for It Follows and The Babadook and those two turned out to be some of the best horror movies of the decade. The Witch did have moments of tension and trepidation, but when the time came for the payoff it simply wasn't sufficient enough to justify the many teases of evil.",7,5,12,19 February 2016
Whiplash," A Top 10 Movie of 2014
","Whiplash is without question one of the best movies of the year and worthy of every single Oscar nomination it has received. The performance by J.K. Simmons is terrifying, easily the best supporting role of the year. The amount of passion he brings to the movie is incredible, even during his 'lighter' moments, his persona is none the less intimidating and frightening at all moments of the movie. He is without a doubt the heart and soul of the movie, take that with a grain of salt. It's pretty crazy to see a movie about music and instruments pack so much energy and passion, when most action movies can't deliver this kind of tension. The movie takes the classic tale of 'What are you willing to sacrifice to be the best?', and spins it around the music career of a dedicated, aspiring drummer. And the movie doesn't make it a cake walk either, Andrew, the title character must first go through emotional hell in order to achieve his dream. (I'll leave the ending a mystery, that way you'll be able to see if he comes out cleansed or not). Whiplash is one of the best movies of the year and certainly one of the most surprising (how many other movies based around music have been a hit lately?) And as I said above, J.K. Simmons deserves an Oscar for his performance, Whiplash may revolve around Andrew, but it's Simmons character who gives the movie life!Full Review at : www.simplefilmreviews.com",9,0,1,25 January 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," A Hollywood Homage with No Story
","Sadly, Hail, Caesar!, is a misfire in the eyes of this reviewer, especially given that it is a Coen Brother's film. This is one of those times where A+ quality people made a C- movie. Simply put, this is a classic case of a movie trailer being more entertaining than the actual movie itself.I understand that the movie is a satire on Hollywood and the craziness that goes on there, but it could have at-least been a bit more amusing. We are shown the craziness of random casting changes, Hollywood gossip, political intervention, director-actor relationships, and the difficulty of keeping everything together. But in doing so, the overall story meanders and never comes full circle (or all that coherent for that matter). The title character (Brolin) goes from one set to the next as we are shown elaborate dance scenes, giant sets, and behind the scenes turmoil. The problem is these scenes do nothing to advance the plot. It's a nice trip down memory lane to see old school productions, but that's it. It's all glitz and glamour and no brains.Caesar may have a ton of star power and production designs galore, but it simply lacks the most fundamental aspect a movie requires, entertainment. I wish I could say I found the movie hilarious or thought-provoking or tense, but I can't. Everything here felt half-baked and the story that seemed to be at the core felt very underdeveloped. Leading to the overall experience being rather boring (I know this is one of the worst words to describe a movie but it appropriately fits here). For a superior experience, go watch 'Trumbo' instead.",4,12,24,5 February 2016
Jaws," One of the Greatest Movies of All Time
","One of the greatest movies of all time, Steven Spielberg has created another masterpiece with his terrifying ocean thriller, Jaws. Scary and tense throughout the entire movie, this is how a true horror movie should be. The movie builds up its villain perfectly without throwing all of its cards on the table too early, which then makes the reveal so much more harrowing and intense. Spielberg takes a great, if not potentially real, storyline and spins it in a way that makes his characters shine just as much as the shark itself. The characters are strong & memorable, and add excitement to each scene as we watch them bond together while hunting the maneater. Jaws is so effective that it actually has sparked real life fear in the hearts of millions who are now overly cautious about going into the open water. You know when a movie has the ability to strike actual fear into people's lives, that the movie itself is something special, Jaws is no different. Jaws is one of the greatest movies of all time, from its fantastic acting to a terrifying theme song, this is a movie for the ages!A Must See!",10,1,2,17 March 2016
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Best of the Three, But Average At Best
","The Battle of the Five Armies marks the end of Peter Jackson's second trilogy in Middle Earth and it could not have come soon enough. This trilogy was average at best average and nothing compared to the original trilogy, Jackson seems to have lost his magic. But getting that out of the way I think Five Armies is the best from this new trilogy, it features some solid action scenes and more emotion than the previous two. Though the action went on for too long, it was still a very welcomed given the previous two films. There is something entertaining about watching a group of diverse people (elves, men, dwarfs etc) all battling it out. And of course Thorins madness and obsession with his mountain and gold was great to watch. But the movie does have quite a few faults, mainly to overuse of CGI. Too much of the scenery was fake, as well as every single character on the enemy side. There was a reason Sir Ian Mckellen broke down on set, it was because he realized he was merely talking to a green screen. Jackson completely dropped the ball here, the costume and makeup design from the first trilogy was something special and noticeable. Here, the movie comes off as too fake for its own good, even if it is top of the line CGI. As for the story aspect, the movie managed to conclude the journey on a decent note, nothing more, nothing less. Nothing to brag about, but it brought an end to character relationships and multiple story lines, some more than others (Tauriel anyone?). As for the overall experience, as I said, this was my favorite from The Hobbit Trilogy. That being said, I will most likely never watch any of these films from beginning to end, the same cannot be said about The Lord of the Rings trilogy!www.simplefilmreviews.com",6,15,30,17 December 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," 'Birdman' Flies, But it Doesn't Soar
","'Birdman' is without question a technical marvel that should be seen by anyone serious about film making. The cinematography is groundbreaking, I wouldn't be surprised if it were to spark a new wave of films trying to capture those magical moments of following actors around, while delivering lines for up to 10-15 minutes at a time. And of course the actors are completely up to the challenge, they give some very strong performances, especially Keaton (I think only Foxcatcher's Steve Carell can rival his performance for Best Actor). But while the movie had all of these fantastic technical achievements (acting, production design, and cinematography), the storyline seemed just a tad derivative for me. When I say that, I mean the classic, 'a has been is giving it one last shot at fame', but instead of the common sports story theme, its about an acting career. I think people are giddy over the fact that the movie basically describes Keaton's acting career and are giving the film slightly too much praise for that sole reason, had it been a different actor playing Riggan, the results would (in my mind) be less spectacular. When all is said and done, the movie didn't have much 'excitement' or 'thrills', it certainly had its moments, but not a strong driving force that kept me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next scene to come. And as a final thought, 'Birdman' really got me reminiscing about, 'Black Swan' and 'The Wrestler', I won't list the similarities, but there are plenty of them (especially between 'Black Swan'). I prefer both of those films when compared to 'Birdman', I think they feature stronger central characters. But my point is that i'm unsure as to whether its a good thing that 'Birdman' inspired me to recollect my thoughts of similar movies and compare the bunch, or it was an unfortunate sin, because it took my thoughts away from 'Birdman'.Full Review At: www.simplefilmreviews.com",7,2,16,3 November 2014
The Conjuring," James Wan makes a great movie out of a terribly generic script
","Even though the exorcism genre is extremely overplayed, The Conjuring stands tall among this overcrowded genre. While it doesn't add anything new to the group, it does a great job building suspense and offers a few genuine scares. The storyline is as bland as they come, a family terrorized by ghosts/demons turns to someone with psychic abilities to fight the demons and ends up needing to perform an exorcism. We've seen this time and time again, but this time James Wan adds some solid nostalgia/style and what I think stood out the most, terrifying sound effects to make the movie something special.I've said it before and I'll say it again, The Conjuring is the most polished, clichéd, horror movie ever made. It features hardly any original ideas, but it takes a generic storyline and somehow makes it shine, it's crazy to see how effective a movie can be in the hands of a good director. A certain crowd-pleaser, this will probably be the general public's favorite horror movie of recent memory, but certainly not mine.",7,0,1,17 March 2016
Lucy," The Writers ran out of ideas before Jumping the Shark
","Luc Besson has a unique idea her in Lucy, but it ultimately gets lost the further the movie goes on, just like with most movies that attempt this type of narrative. With this type of movie (becoming omnipotent), it's hard to have a profound conclusion/3rd act, and this movie is sadly no different. Everything in the first half of the movie is certainly entertaining and thought provoking, but in the end, the writers write themselves into a corner.It's intriguing to see what type of powers she possesses early in the transformation, slowly gaining new abilities and fighting off her foes. But the movie makes the cardinal sin of making her too power, too soon. Way before the movie reaches its climax, she has to powers to basically stop any type of threat opposed to her, which, of course, ruins the ride too soon. Once Lucy gets to around 60% power level she is undefeatable and all the excitement goes out the window and we just have to sit back and see where the writers want to go with this.Omnipotence is probably something writers and filmmakers should avoid for the time being, it's a tricky subject that almost never pays off. Try Besson's Leon: The Professional, for a far more enjoyable and action packed thriller!",5,1,5,17 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Retread from the original 1977 Film
","I should probably say this now, I've never been a Star Wars fan. I like certain aspects of the movies but as a whole, they are way overrated in my eyes. So it should come to no surprise I found the new movie rather tepid. Again, the movie had it's moments of great action, lightsaber battles, and uses of the force, but outside of those moments, the magic wasn't there.Nothing felt new in the sense that this was supposed to be the movie to reinvigorate the franchise. It felt like a total retread of the first movie from 1977. Yes, it had new characters and a slightly new mythos, but everything else was more of the same. The Force Awakens was trying to be nothing more than nostalgia, which is bittersweet. It succeeded as such which will please fans of the original three but at the same time, nothing new was offered, nothing except future promises. It was nice to see old characters and their introductions, but it was borderline too much. Had the movie introduced them then put them on the back burners, we could be talking about something different, but that wasn't the case. It is hard not to talk about specific beats without spoiling the movie. Even the mighty soundtrack by John Williams was borderline the exact same thing as the original, yes it is nice to see it appear once again, but this is a new generation, something new must be offered.That's not to say everything was about the movie, the young new characters seem like a great new addition. Only time will tell how well they develop and fit in within the Star Wars universe. Not to mention they are a driving force behind the great comedic moments in the movie. This was something that was unexpected yet very welcome. The movie has made promises (Mockingjay Part 1 anyone?) so only time will tell where we head from here. But as of now, all these new characters are just treading water waiting for their time to truly take over the franchise.Yes, the movie will break box office records and fans will rejoice the franchise is back. But with the promises of an unknown amount of sequels the franchise will have a difficult time maintaining the stakes at hand. So at the end of the day, it really comes down to the following, is this something I want to rewatch? Something that demands to be seen multiple times because of its greatness? The answer, sadly, is no.",6,6,14,18 December 2015
What We Do in the Shadows," Best Comedy of 2015
","Even though I really dislike the fount footage genre, What We Do in the Shadows proves there are still a few useful ideas yet to be discovered in the subgenre. The movie has been praised as one of the best comedies of the year by many critics, and it certainly lives up to that title. Shadows is a breath of fresh air in the comedy/horror department. Though I can certainly see some people having a problem with the deadpan humor, a lot of the comedy comes from the cultural differences from the extremely old vampires (some dating back to the Medieval Times) as they struggle to keep up with current times. Basically the movie will mostly likely be a bust for you if you are someone who doesn't find the general idea of a bunch of vampires struggling to fit into today's society funny. But it totally worked for me and I loved how they were stuck in the past (decor, clothing style, appliances, etc) and needed a new member to bring them up to speed. But that new member unfortunately is the weakest point of Shadows, Nick is by far the least interesting character and/or aspect of the movie. He is the one character who is there to advance the story so he's more or less necessary, which is bittersweet. But outside of that complaint, Shadows is a blast and one of the years best so far. The writers/actors really utilize the flying aspect the vampires possess and create some solid humor with it. They poke fun at just about every single vampire trope you can think of, not having a shadow, virgins, flying, vampire hunters, and many more. Not to mention the numerous jokes about todays current vampire movies, there are a few but they're pretty funny! So if you are someone (like me) who is sick of todays growing trend of vulgar and gross-out comedies, What We Do in the Shadows is just what we've been waiting for!",9,3,7,20 March 2015
Deadpool," The Perfect Deadpool Movie, but Not a Perfect Action-Comedy Movie
","I'll get this out of the way, I know very little about the character Deadpool and what I do know, doesn't really interest me all that much. I admire that he is different from the majority of comic book characters, but I personally don't enjoy him or his stories. That being said, I'm in the middle of the pack on this one, I certainly didn't love it as much as most people, but I didn't hate it. If you go into Deadpool as a Deadpool fan you will come out a bigger Deadpool fan, it's that simple.My biggest gripe is with the generic action story, it's your typical revenge movie from a story standpoint. Deadpool slices through henchmen climbing his way up the latter to the head honcho who kidnapped his girlfriend. We've seen this before and it seemed comic-book movie fatigue was setting in as he was dismembering henchmen left and right. Yes, the killings were more graphic than normal and Deadpool basically narrated while fighting, but that didn't really hit home with me. Maybe had the movie had more interesting villains and raised stakes the movie could have been great. It all felt a bit too simplistic at times, but luckily this is Deadpool we are talking about and he spices things up as he goes.Obviously, the comedy is the high point of the movie, one-liners, jabs at other superheroes, fourth wall breaks, meta-humor, etc. This is what will make the movie so popular and memorable. I found a lot of amusement with the comedy aspect of the movie, opposed to the action and actual story. Not every single joke lands (it's always rough knowing a scene was supposed to be funny but it wasn't), but based on the amount of them in the movie, there are bound to be plenty that hit home. The jabs at Reynold's past roles were great and so were the jokes involving The X-Men. It was a little refreshing getting a different movie than most comic-book based movies (even if this did have some minor similarities). And the meta humor only made things better.I would be shocked to see a comic book fan not like Deadpool. Everything I know about the character (which isn't much) seemed to be full on display. If you think the trailers to this movie looks funny, then it's almost a guarantee you will find the movie a riot. If you are on the fence like me, you could do much worse. It might not be the perfect action or comedy movie, but it's the perfect Deadpool movie.",3,4,14,13 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," An Extremely Enjoyable Spy-Thriller!
","Kingsman may just be the most exciting and fun action movie of the year, just like last year's surprise hit, Guardians of the Galaxy. The brilliance of the movie rests in the hands of the writers and their tongue in cheek jokes poking fun at the James Bond franchise, as well as American culture, it's nothing short of amazing. They basically were saying that can do everything the Americans can do (action/over the top fighting), but also while maintaining a high level of sophistication while doing so. That being said, the action in the movie looked pretty great, lots of fluid/continuous action shots with some nice choreography. Surprisingly, almost all of the great action choreography comes from the Colin Firth's character! And of course like any spy movie out there, there need to be cool gadgets for our heroes, and Kingsman is no different. Everything in this movie is 'cool', from their clothing to their weapons (bulletproof suits, bulletproof umbrellas, grenade lighters), the Kingsman are basically the new James Bond.In the end, the movie knows exactly what is is trying to do, poke fun at classic spy thrillers while at the same time maintaining a new hip attitude, something today's younger generation would appreciate. And this is not your typical mind-numbing action thriller either, though not terribly original, Kingsman has a certain amount of style and flair to make it something special (that something special might be its political commentary). Kingsman is sure to be one of the best action movies of the year, no question about it!",8,3,5,17 March 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Another Amazing Chronicle of the Nomad Known as Mad Max
","Frank Miller has created a staple in the action movie genre, Mad Max: Fury Road is one hell of a ride! Thankfully, Miller chose not to reboot the franchise starting with a dreadful origin story, instead he chose to follow along the path of 1981's The Road Warrior. The movie picks up after the death of his family where he struggles to survive on his own while he is continuously tormented by their deaths. We know just enough about Max to make the character work, but enough is left hidden to make him a cryptic warrior.The brilliance of the movie is, of course, the action sequences which were mostly done via actually stuntmen. Something about knowing/seeing real people attempting all these crazy scenes/stunts makes the movie much more exciting and authentic. Fury Road is so fast paced and loaded with action galore, you never know what Miller has up his sleeve and what he is going to throw at us next. Though there was a moment or two where the movie seemed to be in action overload and a change of pace was needed. But what really drove the movie home was how he placed all this great action in an obscure, bizarre world where tyrants reign supreme. It's interesting to see the same things that we value today carry over into the post-apocalyptic world, food, water, and, of course, fuel. The world may be a wasteland, but some things never changed, the disparity between people will forever remain.It was also great to see Max taking the backseat and letting Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and the wives lead the movie. They, along with the clan of women, kick just as much if not more ass as Max and the War Boys. Fury Road is being praised for its thoughtful representation of females in the movie, which is absolutely true. Telling this tale with women is partially what makes the movie work so damn well. At the same time, Max is represented as the nomad who is caught in a war of two different parties and is doing nothing more than surviving. The core of the movie may be about Furiosa and her reaching for freedom but at the same time this is just another chronicle of the rogue warrior, Max.Mad Max: Fury Road will EASILY go down as the best action movie of 2015, if not one of the best of the past 25 years! It's safe to say that Mad Max is here to stay, especially since Tom Hardy is signed on for THREE more films! Style and action haven't mixed this well in years!",9,4,10,16 May 2015
The Martian," Being Trapped on a Planet has never seemed so Fun
","The Martian has been one of the most anticipated movies of the year, so did it deliver? It certainly did, not only was the movie intriguing from beginning to end, but it also gave us a different perspective than we were used to for science fiction genre movies. We see the moral complications as well as the psychical complications from having to save a man stranded on Mars. Not only is the movie about surviving on Mars using some serious brain power, but his survival also resides on NASA and their abilities to rescue him. It's this coordination between the two that is the engrossing part of the movie, Mars may be tens of millions miles apart, but the movie makes it seem so much closer. That being said, what makes The Martian great is the scientific accuracy that went into the making of the movie. The movie has already been described as one of the most scientifically accurate movies of all time and you can kind of feel it throughout the movie. And being described like that only boosts your reputation for the better. We are basically shown how to survive on Mars and it's unlike anything we have seen before. If anything, it doesn't even seem all that bad, the movie spins his survival in an uplifting and optimistic way. It's this type of tone that is going to make The Martian more appealing to the masses than if it were spun in a darker, less optimistic way.But if I had to sum up what I didn't like about the movie, it would be that everything was 'too safe'. He solved his problems a bit too fast for them to feel like actual problems. The food, water, oxygen, communications, and heat problems are all (for the most part) solved quite quickly in the movie. I just didn't feel like he was in any real danger for the long term. (But that might just be the point of the movie, the solutions to the problems weren't there real danger, but rather the limited duration of those solutions). Everything was cleaned up too nice and clean, it would have been nice to see him in some actual peril or desperation where he breaks down emotional and rather than physically. But again, that might be the point of the movie (or how the book was), it's sort of like a party out there on Mars for Dr. Watney.The Martian isn't quite as raw as Moon or flourishing with bigger ideas like Interstellar, instead The Martian is a unique tale of survival where smart thinking is the focal point. Certainly one of the better movies of the year (but not quite the best), but one thing is for certain, The Martian is a definite crowd-pleaser!",8,2,58,3 October 2015
