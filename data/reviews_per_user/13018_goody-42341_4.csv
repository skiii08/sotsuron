Blade Runner 2049," Visual Feast, But Something Has Been Lost
","As a fan of the original film for 40 years ( I have three different version of Bladerunner ), you can imagine my longing to see the sequel.Was I disappointed, yes maybe, the visuals are absolutely stunning, the CGI first class, the story is acceptable, acting is a little wooden and lethargic but not a bad movie by any means. There were far too many clumsy links to the earlier movie in both supposed advertising to even the final scene with it's almost identical feel to Roys death in the rain on the roof top. Just a little bit to much of that for a film supposedly set 40 years after the first. The city scenes too were a poor imitation of Scotts first shot at the novel. All the oppressive, visuals of the dark crowded wet streets have been lost to give us , well just dark shots as a substitute. Gosling carried a long film well though at times his melancholia was a little overpowering. Leto is a pretty bland villain, his callous violence is childish and frankly fairly boring, one of the weakest parts of the movie. It seems strange but I feel I would have enjoyed this offering more had I not seen the original. The soundtrack had non of the haunting style I remember so well , just really, really loud special effects Not a bad film just a bit mnaaaaa .",7,6,14,22 October 2017
The Irishman," Way Too Long
","Sadly I have to agree with many reviewers this film is probably at least 30 minutes too long maybe even more. At times events unfold at a boring if not turgid pace. The final journey of Hoffa, the endless fish conversation, frankly was amateirish and tedious.
Pesci was stand out De Nero mmmnah not so much. His at times stolid , wooden acting seemed to slow down what little pace the movie had.
A lifetime work by Scorcese ? please tell .me no and that there is better, sharper things to come",6,11,19,2 December 2019
The Favourite," Comedy, What Comedy?
","I am like many others who found this film tedious , pretentious and completely unfunny. Why on earth this is regarded as a comedy who knows.
The sript and background music made me grind my teeth. The scene involving the dance is embarassingly bad.
A true waste of money and yet another example of ' the Emperors new clothes ' My advice forget the hype , avoid at all cost.",2,22,40,16 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," More overated rubbish from the Greatest Conman
","The movie is down to the recent levels of this directors offerings. A wandering tale, poorly told and frankly for the majority of the time pretty boring. No change that, very boring. A huge waste of acting talent highlighted by a frankly childish script. I have no idea how Tarantino has conned the American public into thinking his films are anything but B grade offerings. This is no exception. Pitt stands out but frankly Decaprio is for much of the time embarassing though no one is helped by poor make up and clumsy direction.
Naturally Tarantino closes with a laughably cheap bloodbath. What is it all about ? Not much really, a film too easily forgotten.",2,6,10,21 November 2019
