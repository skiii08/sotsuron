Deja Vu," Some Pro & teenager Critics likely disappointed
","What a fun thriller for me! Great story, just the right amount of suspense & confusion, sci-fi, romance and some laughs. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Pay no attention to Pro & adolescent reviewers that find this movie lacking to awful. I have read their reviews and have found that they tend to prefer films that are the most offensive & political. Also, it seems that often they have not even seen the movie they are reviewing. Especially on this site, reviewers comment on films they admit to have yet viewed. They pretend to care about the technical aspects of films, but they really don't. I know because I used to be a movie snob reviewer like them.",9,1,4,26 November 2006
