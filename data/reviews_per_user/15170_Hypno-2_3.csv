Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Mr.Lucas shouldn't direct......
","What can you say about phantom menace? quite frankly they're are mixed feelings on this film. i'll try to keep a balance in my review.Quite frankly like the first Star Wars film this film suffers from ego. all can be pointed to the source of Mr.Lucas brilliant yet arrogant brain. The Character depth was only achived by the actors and alot of the time you could feel the tensions of the actors wanting to imporve on lines and scenes but of course this is a big no no when it comes to Mr.Lucas.The wardrobe was fantastic as well as the special effects. Al ot of the characters don't seem to fit very well in the movie. Particularly the original droids. they seem to be thrown in the movie for simple nostalga. There are parts (like the first star wars film) where you feel the minutes go by like a turtle. Unfortuantely the best part of the movie is pretty much the end. Dark Maul is an impressive villain unfortunatly he isn't given many lines which just adds to the disappointment of the movie. You want him to say something memorable like 'I will crush your Jedi bones' or something villain like. To truly appreciate this film you have to look at it as a meal this is just a apertizer and you will get on to the main course dont rush your meal savor it. All in all this was a good film but not an awesome one. Still its star wars! keeping on with the legacy of this incredible triology. Unfortunately if Mr.Lucas could lower his incredible ego maybe this movie could have been better. A lot of characters are memroble and you can tell were the inspiration came from Jar Jar (a very annoying character i might add) race is Caribbean in root. The Jedies are just samuries and this is shown more with the music. Very cool i might add. The Senate is mostly Roman. The beginning of the film i think gives you a flash back to the old godzilla films (youll understand once you see). plus there is some christian beliefs touched in the film. Hopefully the next movie will be better i'm pretty sure of it, but when you watch this movie don't expect a mindblowing film, you'll get good movie with incredible special effects and fight scenes. Still like i said Its STAR WARS!!! what more can you ask?",Null,0,1,28 May 1999
Mulan," Disney please stop
","I have to tell you for a little kid mulan is cool for anyone else trying to learn about the culture of this movie, your being suckerd first off i found the way they handled Mulan very unrealistic theyre was only one scene were we see how males of that time view men, and its in a bad song of all things. Mulans father was done well. and Vanessa Maes influence is the only music i liked in this film that and ill make a man out of you and thats not saying much. The villan ruled the film thats pretty much the only salvable character in this film. and they way he was deafeated was very cartoony. But hell who cares kids will love it cause they dont know any better, lets see what other culture or classic can Disney viloate and butcher.",Null,0,1,26 September 1999
Contact," Nice film, but a INSULT to my culture and country
","Speaking s a native of Puerto Rico, i found the films portrayal of my country as a great insult. First of we do not have village! WHY DO YOU PEOPLE HAVE TO INSULT US JUST TO MAKE MONEY?! dear god folks were not a THIRD WORLD COUNTRY EITHER!!! while i was watching this film about half the audience walked out by these coments, you may think im overreacting but think about it for a while. You come to our land to make a movie, we kindly help in anyway we can, some of us even watch in awe at this movie making and how do you repay us? by slapping us across the face. Thats true american hospitality alright.",Null,1,3,14 November 1999
