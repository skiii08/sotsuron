Ford v Ferrari," Racing at its Best!!
","By far the best racing movie in decades!! The racing scenes are incredible and the acting is award worthy. Being a dihard car guy, I believe I noticed a slight flaw in one scene, which is the only reason I didn't give it a 10 out of 10 rating. During an early race scene (1963?) it showed several Corvettes competing, however one of them had a 1967 stinger hood. Anyway, since I'm planning on going a second time, I'll keep an eye out for it and correct my review if I was wrong =)",9,2,3,17 November 2019
