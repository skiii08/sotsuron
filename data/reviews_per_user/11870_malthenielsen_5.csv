Blade Runner 2049," Too many inconsistencies
","The original Bladerunner is one of my all time favorite movies. This one is way below average. I fear some people who see this one before the original, will now miss out on the original, as they will assume it is bad as well. Watch the original, is has nothing to do with this thing!Anyway. The strong sides of Bladerunner 2049 are: Nice visuals overall, good scenes here and there; I like the music. It is good if you like to just visuals and a story is not your thing. The pace is slow, the dialogue is very forgettable and boring, even in scenes that offer golden opportunities for memorable lines, for instance the goodbye scene after the root-hologram-robot threesome. Characters are undeveloped; they forget to build sympathy for the heroes. The rebel leader for instance; she should be designed to make you feel either positive or negative toward their cause. As it was, you really don't care if they manage with their revolution or not.K's hologram girlfriend I liked though, they should have made her the main character instead and built the movie around her. For me she was a redeeming factor.*SPOILERS* Now to a very weak part ... the many inconsistencies and illogical things.* The evil robot woman can effortlessly walk into LAPD and kill the police boss and steal forensic evidence. They apparently have no security whatsoever in the LAPD and haven't invented security cameras yet. Also she hangs out in the archives for no reason. * The evil mastermind knows that the evil mastermind from the original knew how to make robots capable of pregnancy; for unknown reasons he decides to not science it by himself, it seems to me that a scientific genius would try to do that. Instead he opts to find a robot daughter, that he has no idea is even alive or dead. His goal is to create *a lot* of robots; why having the robots get pregnant is better than just building them makes no sense and is not explained. He seemingly kills a lot of his robots himself for no reason (he offs two, but it seems to be his general habit); this maybe is the reason he does not have enough. As well, he only has ONE robot and a few goons to his dirty work for him; he seems though to have money to afford more than just ONE agent. When he catches Harrison Ford (Deckard), he gets a really dumb idea to make Deckard give up his daughter: 'Please trade me your daughter for a bad copy (wrong eye color) of your dead wife.' How anybody sane would think somebody would take this trade is beyond me. Then he decides to cart Deckard into space presumably to torture him them there because the torture in space is better than torture on Earth; why not just torture him right away on Earth? In sum, he came off more like being dumb and crazy, rather than a mastermind. * The prostitute is sent to get info on K; she settles for a 2 minute talk, and then just leaves it. Later, K's hologram girlfriend needs a prostitute and randomly call this one - how lucky for the prostitute. I think she is a terrible spy with incredible luck! * K himself is at one point saved from scavengers by missiles mysteriously appearing from the sky; he just goes 'whatever' and does not seem interested in figuring out where the came from, or if he is bugged. Some investigator. * Deckard sees K has a toy horse that belonged to Deckard's daughter; he does not seem to care where K got this from. Also: An important lead is a sock from Deckard's daughter, that K finds in a piano in Deckard's old flat. Since Ford left the apartment way before his daughter was born (in the original), he must have returned with one of his daughters socks, to stuff it into the piano. But why? Why would somebody risk life and limb to stuff a sock into a piano?At times the movie is repetitive: the toy horse figures so much it gets irritating; the effect of using real company names for future stuff is also overused. Even the cool street scenes get old, as there's too much of them.They tried getting as many things from the original into this one; a few times it worked, most of the time it is just put of place or badly done. The scene with Deckard's old police colleague is evidently there just to get the iconic origami-making policeman into the movie; if you have not seen the original this scene must seem just pointless and leave you wondering if it was about something you missed. But no; it is just pointless and should have been cut out.Overall I'd say probably do not watch it at all; you can maybe watch it at home on a rainy Wednesday evening if you have nothing else to do and then accept the story is nonsense and the characters are weak, and just enjoy the visuals. I nearly walked out of the cinema and probably would not manage to finish it at home.",2,12,23,31 October 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Just a bad movie
","Just overall badly written - down to the individual jokes not being funny, the side stories being uinteresting and the main plot also didn't work.Marvel apparently wants to reboot the MCU, by 'demoting' or changing a lot of characters. None of the 'demotions' were well done - instead of epic fights against Thanos resulting in the hero loosing his powers or getting injured, they more had them just slip our the back door. It is strange that you would miss an opportunity to have a batch of heroes killed in an epic battle, and instead srite them out the story with bad plotlines.The storyline was also a mess. The initial half hour or was it an hour before things got started could just have been cut down to five minutes, forgettable as it was. It was like the writers just gave up writing a meaningfull story from start to finish, and instead just had a main plotline patched together by coincidences (the bad guys randomly finding out what they heroes were doing), some side plots and then a big fight at the end.Even the selection of music was bad, there was hardly a scene with a really good song fitting a scene. This is something Marvel has been very good at, so it's strange they suddenly couldn't get that right.The point of the movie seems to reboot the MCU, removing a lot of characters because the actors playing them got too old for the roles - and maybe the writers had problems to create a story with a designated quota of heroes dying. I don't know what went wrong in the writing process, bur something for sure did.",4,41,64,31 July 2019
The Dark Knight," Weak movie
","Much surprised this movie is so popular. It has some top level acting performances performances, but...They used CGI for Harvey Dent's mangled face instead of makeup. The result is that he looks like a zombie from a computer game and not like a real person. I don't understand that choice. Especially when they obviously have a good make up guy on board.The action scenes are lacklustre at best. There is simply no interesting fights. Some of the action are really run-of-the mill over the top stuff. Compare this to the fight scenes in a movie like The Matrix. That is a big drawback to me, because fighting is really a big part of what Batman does.It's boring the Joker uses bombs, bombs and more bombs. Normally he used gas a lot. Heath Ledger does a great job. His character is interesting, but just not not really written like the Joker. He lacks the flamboyance and humour. There's not enough comedy themed gadgets using poison and gas. Maybe they just wanted to do something different, but this take in Joker didn't work for me.I find the script messy. The overall problem is that it intriduces characters a lot, and then doesn't do much with them. The Batman-copycats just disappear from the plotline. They are just there in the beginning. There's way too many mafia people. Cut the mafia people down to a few guys and have them share all the mafia lines; this way you can better make them become real characters. The Lau character is another character that gets 'finished with' too fast. We're never even told what happens to him?Alfred also almost disappears from the end of the movie. The Russian ballerina also needs to have a presence during the entire movie; just 2 small scenes more with her makes it feel more like she is a part of something, and not just a character that is part of a machine like plot, so she is just dumped like an unnneded cogwheel. She reacted strongly to Harvey Dent and Batman, it would make sense to say say show a soundbite interview with her on TV letting us know how she felt about the stuff that happened.Then there was a small story loop with Batman getting attacked by dogs. And the big machine they used to spy on all the phones in the city. Those two things were just boring tbh. Would much prefer Batman found the Joker in some interesting creative smart way, where you can go OO THAT WAS SO CLEVER OF BATMAN! instead of just introducing a wonder machine outta nowhere.The point with Batman beating up some SWAT-teams was really dumb. They could just call them and tell them who not to kill; they are supposed to have radios and headsets lol. Or Batman could just tell them 'hey guys, there people are not bad guys but hostages dressed up to be bad guys', seems sort of more simply that beating the bejeesus our of them all. Especially at a point where he needs help, seems to me better to cooperate with SWATs to get the bad guys, instead of beating them up :)So yes, it's well made and directed and has good actors, but the script has too many weaknesses.",3,5,11,11 February 2020
Prometheus," Characters were all off
","The movie has visuals going for it, as well as a setting that COULD have been used to make a good movie. This is why it is so frustrating it turned out so badly.Worst of all are the characters. None of them make any sense. The robot is experimenting on important crew members for no apparent reason. If he had picked one of the presumably expendable people with no name that are on the ship it would make a little sense. As for the first experiment - infecting Halloway, by making him drink alien goo - he doesn't even seem to care what the goo does to him, but looses interest in him. When he discover Halloway's girlfriend is impregnated by an alien embryo, he again for no clear reason decides to sacrifice her and keep the embryo. But when she manages to get the embryo-now-baby-monster, he simply doesn't care, and never inquires whatever happened to the embryo that was important enough to him to kill for. The baby is alive and well where he was left, but he never even goes into the room to bother to see if it's there.His actions seem more like a sick person playing tricks on people because he is bored, and who moves on to something new when the trick is finished.The biologist and geologist also just seem crazy. They freak out for no reason and leave their team - supposedly you would pick more cool headed people for such missions. After that the geologist forgets he is the map expert and has a 3D map, and the biologist tries to pet an alien snake and gets killed.Weyland, the rich man funding everything, hides for no reason in the ship. There is no rational explanation why he keeps it a secret he is on the ship. I am assuming he is paranoid that someone will kill him for no reason, or maybe he just likes to surprise people?Shaw seemingly forgets everything instantly. Her husband is out of her mind as soon as he is dead, and she never mentions to anybody that she just removed an alien embryo from her body. The only thing she remembers is her Cristian cross.Vickers seem like an aggressive sociopath, with no plan and nothing in particular she wants out of the whole space travel project, except bullying her crew mates.The two co-pilots seem strange and sort of sedated. They don't even react more vividly to being blown up for no reason.The captain is the only character that is believable and at least seem like a normal human being.The movie doesn't make sense having characters as these, as they are supposed to be an elite team of top scientists. The movie would have worked if they had adopted the 'Dirty Dozen' plot, that mental patients and convicts get a chance to get a clean slate of they volunteer for a suicide mission in space. Alternatively, this could be an internal plot in Weiland's company - his colleagues want to kill him, so they manage to get him the worst crew they possibly can, to ensure he never returns from his mission. This would have made the movie work better, it would at one stroke have explained most of the erratic behaviour of the characters, and it would have been a chilling background story. As it is, it simply does not make any sense.",1,19,27,1 June 2016
Annihilation," The Annihilation of a meaningful story
","This movie could have been good - but was terrible. Some mainstream movies have their characters behave like teenagers in slasher movies, regardless of them officially being scientists or master assassins or whatever. I see the reason for this; in horror movies, the characters need to interact with 'the dangerous thing', and if the characters act efficiently and have ressources, it turns into an action movie. So characters are dumbed down, in order to make them less efficient. The price of this, is that you get nonsensical characters, like clueless scientists.So. The US army found this alien shimmer that expands in a zone, and they think it threatens the entire world. They have zero date from the zone. There's no reason to belive the expansion will continue indefinitely; it might just stop. It is cautious to assume it will keep expanding. This is not adressed at all. The scientists just go 'it expanded yesterday, so it will keep doing so forever.' Instead of using the not neglible ressources of the US Army - nuke the alien, send in entire bataillons in Apache Helicopters, or just send teams inside the bad zone for half an hour, gather data and then retreat to return the data - just go in, grab some plants and soil samples, go out.Instead they go for the worst option imaginable; send small teams deep inside for long expeditions, thereby ensuring none will survive and bring data back. So for THREE years the US army is just watching the bad thing do it's thing and do nothing. A sane person with 10 people working for him could have gotten more information, than the US army got in three years.So. The team with the heoine on it goes inside the zone. It is an all-female team, I guess because of current tropes. They are supposedely soliders, but carry no useable military gear in the large backpacks they probably just use to show 'look it is so army-like because of the large backpacks.' They have nothing with them - booby traps, mines and such - that helps them tp secure a camp in a very hostile environment. Now who'd have thought that could have been useful, everybody else that went in died, but well, that probably means all they need is tents and guns and no mines! The team makes no sense. Why not add 10 marines to take care of them? I guess marines are so expensive: The entire world is threatened, but the US army doesn't want to waste marines on this. The team furthermore seems to have no real command structure or any routines, some team members do not know the goal of the mission, some have not bothered to look at a map of the area. At one point they sleep in a gigantic complex, potentially shot full of monsters, and do not bother to do the 'secure the area'-thing soldiers love to do. Oh and it's not like it would be useful that everybody had a map, in a place where everybody else had died! Nobody could foresee you might end up alone, having no clue where you are! At the end the team leader just leaves her team, and makes nothing out of the whole 'I am supposed to order you guys to make this mission happen', she is OK-doky that the others feel like disobeying orders. A team member is killed by a bear, no serious rescue mission is attempted, one team member afterwards wanders off alone (well why bring more people to cover you, it's better to send just one person while the others hand around and chill). They find a video with information of what is going on; they just watch it fast and then argue about what was in the video. Oh yes, it's not like it would be useful in saving your lived and such to understand the video, really, why waste 20 seconds of your life watching it a second time? Who needs information in a place where everybody dies from unknown reasons?Now let me jump to the end. The hero saves the world, yet when she gets back to base, the commanders seem angry and suspicious of her. Why are they not happy that she saved the world? Did they want to include the 'parents unfairly angry with teenager'-trope. I figure that if a soldier saves the world, this is the sort of thing that should make commanders happy, and give the soldiers medals. But in this movie, commanders get angry if you succeed. They sent her on what they thought was a suicide mission, yet appear suspicious/perplexed about the fact that her team members died? Are these commander guys like 'we send people on suicide mission, but do not understand why anybody would die on this dangerous suicide mission! Foul play!'At the end of the movie the heroine's husband is obviously an alien clone/copy of her real husband. She hides this from the commanders - because she is happy to have an alien copy of her dead husband? As a scientist, she should realize, that the alien will most likely eat her or infect her with something (that's what the aliens have been doing!), but who cares in a movie that thinks scientists = idiots. I also doubt that normal people would appreciate alien copies of their loved ones!It is interesting that older movies have handled these issies well. 'Stargate' has a scientist/military team that acts like a scientists/military team, and not as 'team confused teenager'. 'Stolen Bodies' has people reacting believable to alien clones of their loved ones. A plethora of movies has believable military debriefings. It's not hard to do these hings well, yet this movie failed.",1,18,35,19 June 2018
