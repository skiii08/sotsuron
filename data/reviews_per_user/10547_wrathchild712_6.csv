Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Possibly the funniest movie EVER
","Yes that's right folks - I'll go there. Borat is not the funniest movie of the year, of the millennium or of the past ten years - it is the funniest movie ever. I have never laughed so hard and so often as I did watching this film. Sacha Baron Cohen is a comic genius, and should be commended for his work here. Go to this movie expecting to be offended, because I simply can't think of a group here he doesn't poke fun at. Jews, gays, women - all are touched on, but in such a way that the offensive nature of the film reveals the bigoted nature of his (I can only assume) clueless co-stars. Cohen himself is orthodox Jewish, so for him the jokes are purely that - jokes. However, you'll see that such is not necessarily the case for those around him. Even if you align with a group that is targeted, if you can see the fun intended by the movie, it will keep you laughing for hours. (Being Jewish myself, I still found the Running of the Jew and 'cockroach' scenes to be among the best in the movie.) Folks, this is one movie you must see before you die. Days later I'm still quoting it with the many friends I saw it with, and am planning at least one more trip to the theaters to see it again.Easily gets a 10/10",10,11,34,6 November 2006
28 Weeks Later," Excellent second chapter for the franchise!
","Simply put, summer sequels should never work out this well. Normally, follow-ups to reasonably successful movies fall flat - it's nothing new. But this is a normal scenario; in most of these cases you'll have all of the superstars that made it's predecessor such a success coming back for more, and maybe the director if you're lucky. 28 Weeks Later, the follow-up to the brilliant 2002 flick 28 Days Later, went 0 for 2 here, losing not only visionary director Danny Boyle, but also its entire cast - which had no A-List stars but rather an infinitely more effective group of lesser-knowns. On paper, this movie was doomed to fail.But amazingly, it doesn't. New director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has created an excellent new chapter for the franchise - a success in that it maintains the style of the first film, but still manages to be its own movie.Arguably the biggest name in the movie is Robert Carlyle as a middle-aged Englishman named Don, although the film focuses primarily on the journey of his two children, Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots). We don't meet them immediately; the prologue beginning places them at refuge in Spain shortly after the first outbreak of the rage virus, setting us up for, yes - a zombie attack, and more importantly a key moment of cowardice from their father.Following this, we learn of the events that followed the initial breakout of infection. Fast forward to today, and we see an American occupation/restoration attempt (sound familiar?) of the lone secure area of London, the Isle of Dogs. If the new populace stays within the boundaries, they're safe from infection. Right...if you give a child a new toy, is he really to be expected NOT to play with it?Inevitably, Andy and Tammy's curiosity gets the better of them, and after a reunion with their father, they venture outside to explore their old home, setting off a chain of events that will introduce infection to the world again. Along the way, we meet an array of genuinely likable characters, including US Army nurse Scarlet (Rose Byrne) and the sympathetic sniper, Doyle (Jeremy Renner).From a stylistic standpoint, Fresnadillo's clearly polished up the work of Days. The tight, frenetic camera work is still present, but the film no longer has that grainy quality that was the first film's lone miscue. In other words, the franchise no longer looks as though it's being shot on a Super-8 camera, and this is a welcome change. Special effects are perfectly utilized, particularly in one specific moment of desperation that is also the film's most notable for possible political undertone. The result is a work that looks the part of the Hollywood blockbuster it's sure to become while maintaining the best qualities of its lower- budget predecessor: endearing characters and an intriguing plot.But now we're left with the vital question of whether to take the franchise a step further into 28 Months Later. Weeks sets that venture up perfectly, and with a possible return of Danny Boyle to the helm, one can only look forward to it with great anticipation.8.5/10",9,2,5,15 May 2007
Batman Begins," a stunning return to form...
","Hands down, Batman Begins is the best movie of 2005 so far. What a surprise! When I went in, I'd read about the amazing cast and had seen a trailer, so I thought it would be entertaining. At the same time though, I couldn't forget the horrendous Batman and Robin, (which had a double-take-worthy cast yet was a real stinker) so I was worried as well.But, wow...For a few minutes after I walked out, all I could say or think was 'wow...' I'm amazed at how great a job they did with this movie. Christopher Nolan's direction was perfect, and the cast completely lived up to its hype. (All except Tom Wilkinson, who in my opinion is about as believable as an Italian mobster as Stephen Hawking would be as an opera singer.) Christian Bale was perfectly cast and rivals Michael Keaton as the best Batman ever. Another favorite for me was Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon.Which leads me to another thing about this movie that I loved. It really is the starting point. Not just for Batman, but for Gordon, who when the movie starts out is just a captain or a lieutenant, (I forget what rank he was...) and for The Scarecrow (Big ups to Cillian Murphy here) and finally (though he does not actually make any appearance in the movie and his existence is only hinted at in the end) the Joker.The best thing about this movie is that it takes the Batman series and helps it rise from the depths of the Joel Schumacher era. Rather than focusing on big stars playing villains, Christopher Nolan reserved the strongest performance in this movie for the only character who should have it - Batman. But then, this movie is supposed to be about Batman...so it all fits.An easy 10 out of 10.",9,1,2,29 June 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," What a surprise!!!
","Last night, for the second time this summer, I walked into a movie that I was extremely worried about. With Batman Begins and now Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I had a really deep fear that the films would be terrible, yet that the hype was so good that I'd end up saying I liked them. With both movies, I did end up liking them, but because they were genuinely GREAT movies.With Charlie, there were so many questions. Will it be better than the original? Will it stick to the story since it is, in fact, named after the Roald Dahl book, unlike the original movie? Will Johnny Depp make us all forget about Gene Wilder? As soon as it started, I knew it would be great. Danny Elfman did the soundtrack, and brilliantly so. Whatever the scene called for, be it the orchestral arrangements in the opening few minutes, or the clever new Oompa- Loompa songs, everything fit musically.All of the members of the Bucket family were enjoyable and well played. Freddie Highmore was perfectly cast as Charlie and had that charisma that made it impossible to root against him. David Kelly was great as Grandpa Joe, and I really enjoyed Grandma Georgina's oddball irrelevance. Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter were well cast as Mr. and Mrs. Bucket. On that note I would like to say I was glad there was actually a Mr. Bucket in this movie. In the original they played with the story a bit and said he had died. They even had his toothpaste- cap-screwer job exactly as it was in the book in this movie. Well done, guys!The other children gave me mixed reactions. Augustus Gloop was not a hard act to fill. Just a fat boy who eats and eats...and eats. Nevertheless, he was entertaining. I liked the little girl that played Veruca, though I think in retrospect the girl who played her in the original was better. Anna Sophia Robb, as Violet, was my favorite of the brat kids. I did NOT like Mike Teavee at all. For the way the script was written, I guess the kid played the role well. But the problem was with the script. Mike was WAY too intense. (Though I did quite like how Johnny Depp constantly made fun of his 'mumbling')Ah yes, Johnny Depp and Deep Roy...aka Willy Wonka and the Oompa Loompas. At first I thought Depp was forcing his role a little, but I grew to like how he was so much quirkier than Gene Wilder had been in the original. For me, part of Willy was how he acted when placed around other people, when he'd alienated himself completely from the outside world. There would be a bit of weirdness in this situation, and Depp pulled it off nicely. Deep Roy was good as the Oompa Loompas. I loved their new songs, but the costumes weren't doing it for me. Plain old orange and white like in the original would have been better if you ask me. The movie LOOKED spectacular too. That's one of my favorite Tim Burton trademarks - his ability to create totally magical worlds. From the dark, odd environments of Nightmare Before Christmas to Big Fish and now Charlie, scenery is where his true talent lies. The Chocolate Room exemplifies this perfectly. When that door opens and the kids walk in, how can you not think to yourself 'Tim, you da man!'? They stayed true to the story, Johnny Depp was outstanding, and this movie was way better than the original. What more do you need?",9,3,6,7 August 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Best Potter Film Yet!!!
","This is it. At this point in the Harry Potter book series, the books get longer...and darker. Between 'Prisoner of Azkaban' and 'Goblet of Fire' you see the former having almost no mention whatsoever of the evil Lord Voldemort, whereas the latter closes with his dramatic return. While I prefer the third BOOK to the fourth BOOK, as far as the movies go, Daniel Radcliffe and Co. have, with the film version of Goblet of Fire, topped the Azkaban movie, which I never would have expected.Admittedly, it took a second or third viewing of 'Azkaban' before I could appreciate Alfonso Cuaron's masterful job. Before I saw 'Goblet,' I thought that Cuaron had set himself up better with that than Mike Newell had with Goblet - the main reason for this being that Cuaron turned a 400-odd page book into a two and a half-hour movie, while Newell had reportedly taken the 752 page 'Goblet' and put it into the same two and a half hour time frame. (This was a project that Newell reportedly, at one time, wanted to make into TWO movies.)But dammit, Newell pulled it off, and gloriously so. Obviously, some things had to be left out of the movie, (For example, Harry's vicious Dursleys are left out, as is the back story of the House-Elves) but what you need is there. You get not only the three tasks and the Yule Ball in this two and half hours, but you also get the trademark signs of adolescence in the quarrel between Harry and Ron that is quite prominent in the book.Most of the Potter regulars are back, and in fine form. Michael Gambon did not come off as well this time around as headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Dumbledore gives off a calm, cool disposition in the books - and here he seemed really on edge, and agitated. (Still, given the state of things in the movie, who wouldn't?) Newcomers Miranda Richardson (Rita Skeeter) and Brendan Gleeson (Professor Moody) are perfect additions to the series. But the best addition to this franchise was, without a doubt, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort. Despite having relatively little screen time in the film, his maliciously evil portrayal of the Dark Lord when he WAS on screen shows me that he will be invaluable as the franchise continues. The scenery and CG sequences were, as usual for this series, top notch. The three tasks of the Triwizard Tournament look, simply, outstanding. One thing I particularly liked is that Newell seemed to breath more life and color into this movie than was to be found in the Azkaban movie, despite the fact that the fourth book is considerably darker and more mature than the third.My only criticism is the lack of time Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) gets on screen. In the books, Harry and Sirius meet up several times, not just once where the two don't even interact in person. With an actor like Gary Oldman playing the role, it is almost a crime to not take the five or ten extra minutes to get him in the film more.However, it may as well be a simple misdemeanor charge, because the rest of the film more than makes up for it. I walked out stunned. This is not only the best movie in the Potter franchise, but it IS the best movie of the year. 10/10",10,0,2,19 November 2005
The Departed," Movies don't get much better than this.
","D'you know the types of movies from which you walk out after your first view knowing (not thinking, but KNOWING) that it's among your favorite movies ever? D'you know how rare it is for a movie like that to come along? A movie that strikes you like a Muhammad Ali punch, appealing in all aspects to your movie-going senses? Well, my friends, the Departed is one of those movies. I could be blunt and end this review right now by saying there's simply nothing wrong with this movie and giving it 10 stars. And while that's absolutely true, why be blunt? In the opening scene of the movie, whilst you're flying through the skyline of Boston and hearing the Rolling Stones' classic 'Gimme Shelter,' you just know this will be one hell of a movie.We've all seen mafia films, or just films focused on crime in general, where the plot focuses on the identification of a rat in the system. The rat, typically viewed as 'bad' (for lack of a better turn) by the criminals, who have the audience's sympathy, is eventually found out, eliminated and voilà! The movie ends with the criminals winning and the audiences happy. But The Departed takes it to a completely different level, having not just one - but TWO rats; one working IN the Police Department FOR the mafia and one working FOR the Police Department WITH the mafia. It is here that the movie really succeeds, because both characters, with their completely different agendas, merit your sympathies throughout the film, and you're constantly questioning who to root for in the conflict.The movie has so many solid performances that it should be illegal. Of course there are DiCaprio, Nicholson, Damon and Wahlberg to be spoken of, but even actors like Alec Baldwin (who I stopped taking seriously many years ago) Anthony Anderson (whom I've never much cared for) contributed positively to the film. My personal favorite performance was from Mark Wahlberg who, asshole that his character Dignam was, still delighted you every minute he was on screen.As mentioned earlier, the soundtrack is a pivotal contributor to the overall effect of the movie. Scorsese used more popular, mainstream music as a backdrop, rather than predictable, clichéd orchestral and Opera music. (Although the latter does make an appearance in one scene of the movie.) He compiled a soundtrack of songs that fit each scene in which they were played. The aforementioned opener, 'Gimme Shelter,' for example, gives you that cool, collected feeling while being used to depict the cool, collected nature of Frank Costello's earlier years in power. Later, the best used song in the soundtrack, Dropkick Murphys' 'I'm Shipping Up To Boston,' reminds us all that, even though it's a mafia film, all the sh*t's going down in Beantown.I'd compare the film to another Scorsese masterpiece, Taxi Driver, for one main reason. Both start out as 'solid' movies, movies that entertain you and are worth the price of admission, but then develop into true classics as the reels roll on. (Pardon the pun.) With Taxi Driver, it was Betsy's rejection of Travis Bickle that catalyzed his dramatic character change. Here, it was the first MAJOR murder. (I say major, because there are numerous smaller ones throughout the film of little to no consequence. I won't further spoil this movie in naming the murder, but once you see it, you'll know - and the movie skyrockets from that point on into sheer ecstasy.)Martin Scorsese SHOULD win the Best Director honor at the Oscars, and The Departed SHOULD win Best Picture this year. (They may or may not; you never know, given his luck with the Academy.) Regardless as to trophies and the decisions of a select group of so-called 'movie experts,' anyone who considers themselves a TRUE movie fan should see this movie. It might just be the best film Scorsese's ever made and, yes, it cracks my top 5 list.10/10",10,1,2,28 January 2007
