Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Just as good as the original!
","I knew right away i had to see Vol.2 after i saw the first half. Tarantino has created something in Kill Bill movies that is totally mind blowing. The interesting characters, the killer soundtrack and the action sequence from the swordplay to the hand to hand combat. The second half i think i enjoyed more because it seemed to explore more of the characters and what has happened to all of them. Thats why i loved the Pai Mei scenes with the bride because it gives you all the answers of how she became such a deadly d.i.v.a. Not forgetting to mention the excellent fighting sequences by Pai Mei.It's also very cool to see more of Bill a.k.a Snakecharmer,Elle Driver a.k.a Clifronia Mountain Snake and my complete favourite in the whole movie Budd a.k.a Snakecharmer played by the great Michael Madsen (who i loved in Donnie Brasco and The Getaway) they are all amazing in their violence skills and character. This is a brilliant ending to a brilliant whole movie.",Null,0,1,1 March 2005
Scarface," Pure Filmaking. This is it!
","He had accomplished the incredible in 'The Godfather' for such an early role and age,turned into a genius of acting in 'Dog Day Afternoon'and became one of the greatest living actors in the world in 'The Godfather Part 2'. But none of them can even compare to his performance in this absolutely amazing film. I have now seen 'Scarface' 23 time sand can still say it is one of the greatest films i have ever seen. Everything in it is still brilliant Brian De Palma's amazing directions, totally great story from Oliver Stone and without a doubt Pacino's best acting (and he did not get an Oscar why?). The chainsaw scene is even more chilling as it ever was and same as the infamous climax at Tony Montana's mansion at the end with that mother of a gun. A total favourite of mine!",Null,0,1,17 January 2005
Oldboy," Now this is REAL cinema!
","old boy is a fantastic exploration of the violence of how a man can be if you do the wrong things to him (say put him in a prison for 15 long years with no particular reason). The story starts with our main man Oh Dae-Su who is kidnapped and locked in a tiny room for 15 years with absolutely no contact with any of the outside world. After learning that his wife was murdered and that he is framed for it he is soon released, holding a mobile phone and a wallet full of cash with a young girl to help him on his trail for revenge to the men who took what is left of his life away from him. I don't want to go into the story too much because it is just totally incredible and almost too hard to explain.Just watch and enjoy this highly realistic,disturbing and drop dead unbelievable tale of revenge and of a man who has been wronged and in undeniable pain. Definitely one of the best foreign films ever made and a film that will stay with you forever. 10 out of 10.",Null,13,98,17 May 2005
Taxi Driver," Just completely beautiful cinema!
","I have seen Taxi Driver 18 times now and i'm only 15(obviously i should'NY be watching it but who would miss this). It's just simply one of the most precious and coolest films ever made from the the De Niro/Scorsese combo.Everything from the mass violence to the seedy street atmosphere, the pure talented direction of Scorsese (who also had an amazing cameo as the freaky ass homicidal passenger) to the chilling and incredible performance from De Niro as Travis which is without a doubt one of the best psycho's ever.Because of him i now think it is so cool just to be able to the words 'You talking to me?' this film is amazing and for crying out loud why has'NY Martin Scorsese got an Oscar yet. The man is a film genius and not one yet.",Null,0,0,25 February 2005
He Got Game," The incredible Denzel strikes again!
","I brought this film from ebay a couple of months ago as you can never find it anywhere in England. Iwatch it and i thought it was an abslute perfection from the amazing Spike Lee and far superior to a lot of his other movies at the time. I like this Lee film in particular though because it is more character driven and has more emotion to most of Lee's films. Denzel Washington has again proved he is one of the all time greatest living actors with his strong performance as Jake Shuttlesworth who makes friends in the film with a prostitute (beautifully played by Milla Jovovich). But what also surprises me about this film is the fact that the main character Jesus Shuttlesworth played by Ray Allen is not even an actor! Yet his performance is extraordinary in this is one of the best i've seen in any Spike Lee film just after Denzel's in Malcolm x and Edward Norton's in 25th Hour. All in all the stylish story, acting,cinematography and the mastery of Lee's directing this is one of my instant Spike LEE classics. Ten out of ten.",Null,1,3,27 February 2005
American History X," The most powerful movie ever made!
","I saw American History x shortly after i had seen 'Primal Fear'and i could not believe Edward Norton! He is incredible, even though Primal Fear was his first ever major movie role it was probably one of his best ever and definitely the best performance of 1996.Then i see American History x and i was mesmerised by this young mans acting capabilities in any role he takes and this has to be his most bravest and best, why he did not get an Oscar i do not know. I mean obviously the film is very strong and a right heartbrake but then again people forget that this still is what goes on sometimes in America. Racism is still often going on and fights. Thats why this is such a powerful and important picture because in some ways what you see most of the movie is probably true and it shows you what being ignorant and racist can lead to and Edward's character Derek Vinyard will soon find that out.Altogether the acting,cinematography and the story make this film an easy 10 out of 10.",Null,0,1,22 December 2004
Schindler's List," Is definitely up there with one of the most powerful films of all time!
","Some films i feel you can watch and just think there is something wrong and you don't really feel anything from it. There is nothing that shocks you whether it be the story or the acting. Schindlers list is one of those films like a lot of other Spielberg greats (Saving Private Ryan,Jaws)really grips you.This is probably the most powerful epic of any historical event ever made. Everything about it is perfection for a good movie. From the incredible performances by Liam Neeson as Oskar who i felt had deserved an academy award more than any actor alive for his performance and also for Ralph Feinnes as a terrifying Nazi and Ben Kingsleyalso gives another memorable performance as Jewish factory worker Izthak Stern right to the dazzling cinematography (the film was shot in an amazing black and white style to give it a more historical and realistic look). I think my favourite scene of the film has to be at the beginning when you see the all the Jews being evacuated and terrorised by German soldiers and then suddenly a little girl appears in a red dress which is the only coloured part of the film. That to me is shot that will go down in movie history.Many people believe that Spielberg is the kind of guy who is always going to be remembered for masterpieces like E.T,Jaws and the Indy trilogy. In my opinion this is the film where we knew that Spielberg was right next to Martin Scorsese and Spike Lee was one of todays greatest living directors.",Null,30,51,10 June 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Classic Tarantino Cinema!
","Ever since i saw 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Jackie Brown'. All my in my all time top ten favourites, all i've ever waited for is the next film from Tarantino and here it is! KIll Bill vol.1 is probably after Takeshi Kitano's 'Zatoichi'the best violent swordplay film ever made! The choreography of this film done by the magic Yeun Woo-Ping( i believe he did the Matrix movies and Jet Li movies) is some of the best ever done in an action film. The story you can tell has Tarantino's signature all over it from the characters to the dialogue to the hot soundtrack! I have to say my favourite thing about Kill Bill though is definitely the characters right from the Bride to the man from Okinawa. It was also good to see Darryl Hannah in a bad role for once as the crazy Elle Driver. My favourite scene is in fact not the end showdown but the beginning fight the bride has with Jeannie Bell a.k.a Copperhead which is brilliant and hilarious especially when she tries to shoot her through the cereal box and the bride gives her one right in the chest in front of her daughter. Maybe a lot would agree it's not as good as Dogs or Pulp Fiction but i loved it right from the start to the end of vol.2",Null,6,13,1 March 2005
Reservoir Dogs," Classic Tarantino bliss!
","We all know Quentin Tarantino's amazing masterpieces 'Pulp Fiction','Jackie Brown''True Romance','Natural born killers' and both 'Kill Bill' movies and i still don't know out of all of them which is his best. Everyone of course would say 'Pulp Fiction' and probably so would i, but every time i watch a Tarantino i always still think Dogs. Mainly because it was his debut film and for a debut it is one of the best films ever made, the characters are so colourful (not just their names) and interesting to hear talk (Tarantino's brilliant dialogue), the acting by all men is some of the best by anyone who has ever played a criminal(Keitel,Buscemi,Madsen). Michael Madsen is magnetic as Mr.Blonde who has got to be one of my all time favourite screen villains. The torture scene, i mean OH MY GOD!. An easy ten out of ten.",Null,0,1,27 February 2005
Man on Fire," The daddy of Revenge cinema!
","Before i saw this film i had already been a huge Denzel Washington fan anyway with 'Training Day' and 'He got Game' but i have to say this goes above all the rest of any of either Denzel's or Tony Scott's work. The film is outrageously cool and is one of the most compelling and realistic revenge movies ever made. Easily. Denzel gives his most frightening performance ever as John Creasy and is backed up by Chris walken and Mickey Rourke. Both in great roles. When i first heard about it i thought it was'nt going to anything special with films like 'Kill Bill'and 'Walking Tall'just coming out i thought it was just going to be your average revenge film. But its not at all. With the setting being in Mexico City which i have heard is a terrible place for any human being these days,the cracking storyline and twists which regularly pop up and an awesome realism to it it's very different from any of Scotts films and any other revenge thrillers. Altogether i thought it was terrific and was a killer to any other film you would probably see this year. So if you see only one film in 2005, make it Man On fire. You'll love it.",Null,2,4,18 May 2005
Goodfellas," What movies are made of!
","This gangster epic directed by Martin Scorsese is still a movie that every time i watch it i can never get tired of it.The story is as beautiful as it ever was, Henry Hill (magically played by Ray Liotta)grew up to observe and love the Mafia life in 1955 Brooklyn, starts doing odd jobs for them here and there,14 years later he's a wise guy and partners with Jimmy 'the gent' Conway and Tommy Devito (we get the outstanding pleasure once again by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci)but still working for Paulie Sicero (Paul Sorvino)and just living gangster fabulous with his beautiful wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco,god it goes on forever)but soon tragedy happens when Henry Hill becomes a cocaine addict,the three Goodfellas brutally kill a 'made guy' etc.The thing i have always hated about this film is when Henry goes into the witness protection program at the end of the movie and Jimmy and Paulie go to prison.(crying).Other than that the acting is incredible, the hot soundtrack and it's really just pure movie making.",Null,0,0,22 December 2004
