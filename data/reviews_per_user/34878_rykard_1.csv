Iron Man 3," Really Bad Film
","I walked out after about 15 minutes. The movie simply wasn't fun. It jumped from scene to scene without transition, and there were entirely too many characters. The music was bad. I think the worst part was the focus on Stark's PTSD. I realize that writers and directors seem to want to try and humanize movie heroes, but superheroes aren't ordinary and I at least don't want to watch them break down; no matter how triumphantly they return.From the reviews I have now read it sounds like they tried to do too much and there just wasn't enough time to do it well. I am certain many people will like this film, but it was bad enough I don't think I can ever even watch any of its predecessors again. Its an amazing piece of work that can ruin what came before.",1,20,43,3 May 2013
