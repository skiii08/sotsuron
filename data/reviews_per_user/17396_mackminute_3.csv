Skyfall," Chicken Little was Right
","Bond is back... both literally and figuratively. The first two Daniel Craig era Bond films took the franchise in a distinctly different direction. They were both good movies but somehow weren't fully Bond. Craig's Bond is a new Bond for a new age; tougher, edgier, and more serious. Bond had lost some of his charm and pretty much all of his sense of fun. Going into Skyfall I was resigned that my and my father's Bond was completely gone. It was a pleasant surprise to see I was wrong.Skyfalll hits the sweet-spot between Octopussy and Casino Royale. It preserves the energy and grittiness of the new Bond but brings back just enough of the old Bond's levity to remind the audience that Bond is supposed to be fun.Beyond the solid script and heart stopping action, Skyfall is far and away the most visually striking Bond movie yet. Whoever is is doing the location scouting and production design also deserves special recognition. Skyfall is the perfect way to celebrate 50 years of Bond. It pays homage to the storied history of 007 while pioneering a new trail for Bond to venture for years to come.Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars... and this has been The Mack Minute.

Django Unchained," Tarantino being Tarantino
","Django Unchained is a bit of a conundrum, largely in part due to it's creator Quentin Tarantino. I have had long love/hate relationship with his movies. When he debuted in 90's with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction I rode shotgun on the Tarantino bandwagon, but as time wore on and more and more of his personality came to light I started to sour. Tarantino strikes me as that kid in middle school that got crammed in a trashcan and rolled down the hill and who was rejected by cheerleaders in high school. He has spent the rest of his life trying to prove to all of us that he really is cool. That desperation for hipness bleeds through in everything he makes. This is not to say he is without talent because he does have a sharp eye and a feel for jaunty banter. He also has a encyclopedic knowledge of film history and flair for homage. That can be double edge sword though, what differentiates insightful reference and a lack of his own voice?That brings us back to Django Unchained which is Tarantino's spin on spaghetti westerns. It's Tarantino through and through. From soundtrack to visuals it all screams 'LOOK HOW COOL I AM!' and occasionally it's right. There are scenes that feature genuine humor and visual flash as well as some solid performances in particular from Sam Jackson, who steals all of his scenes. All of this is smothered in Tarantino juice and there's the rub. If you love him you'll the love movie but if you think he's a pretentious douche bag this movie won't change your opinion. So many of his conceits took me right out of the movie from his typical 'hip' soundtrack to Jamie Foxx's sunglasses.Django Unchained like most of Tarantino's movies is unapologetic in it's violence and often wanders the gray wastes of where just tasteless ends and where offensive begins. One has to question if he makes these forays for anything other then shock value. Despite all of Tarantino's efforts, he doesn't quite drive me away. Beneath it all Django Unchained is a serviceable revenge tale with several water cooler moments but beyond that? ... More shock then awe.... and this has been The Mack Minute.

Zero Dark Thirty," For God and country... Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo
","When you ask yourself 'Is this the same movie I saw ads for?' it's usually not a good sign but in this case it is. The ads sell Zero Dark Thirty as a pure action movie which it defiantly is not. The hunt for Osama Bin Laden was a long and arduous process and director Kathryn Bigelow does a remarkable job illustrating the devotion and sacrifice that was required to finally find him. It's a unflinching look at the tactics and internal politics that evolved over the years it to bring Bin Laden to justice.There is a sense of of tension and urgency that drives the movie forward from the first moments of the movie. As Maya, Jessica Chastain ably acts as the fulcrum around which a strong ensemble cast revolves. Her strong portrayal of an agent who's determination turns to obsession in her ceaseless campaign to find Bin Laden is central to the success of this movie.Bigelow has made one of 2012's best crafted films that should be in contention for much recognition (and rightfully so) during award season. A strong script, solid visuals and good performances from a talented ensemble cast make Zero Dark Thirty one of my favorite movies of the year..Rating: 4 out of 5 stars... and this has been The Mack Minute.
