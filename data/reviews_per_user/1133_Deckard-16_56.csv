The Blair Witch Project," This doesn't pass even as a student film.
","Sometimes popular opinion really sucks about a film elevating a rotten movie to cult status and if you don't like it then you obviously don't get it. This movie is one of them. The much discussed camera moves did not make me sick, but the whiny idiotic characters did. The suspense was minimal. I don't care if it was really low budget. I'm not going to grade a film on degree of difficulty. I'm sure that 'Titanic' was a very tough experience for the production crew. I don't care! It was a great movie because it had a great story and great characters and was really well put together. This movie didn't have any of those things. It telegraphed the last shot in the first 15 minutes. This is one of those rare films that made me angry that I wasted my time with it.",1,2,4,1 May 2000
Moneyball," Brad Pitt's bet pays off big.
","The fact that this film ever got made with its troubled production history is a minor miracle, but due to Brad Pitt sticking with it did get made. His faith in the material was not misplaced. This film is a major success.There hasn't been sports film this weird since 'Field Of Dreams'. Aside from the performances its pleasures lie elsewhere. The script makes numbers crunching amusing, there are jokes without punchlines, an unhurried pace which allows for potent pauses (as opposed to pregnant pauses) & a confidence in itself which is intoxicating. It also doesn't hurt to have Chris Nolan's Oscar winning cinema-photographer, Wally Pfister, adding what amounts to be almost another character to his shots.Another odd choice was Bennett Miller who brings his art house smarts to this defiantly non-mainstream material. A team of underdogs hasn't been managed/directed this well since with as much success since the '88 Dodgers or the '02 Angels (I live in SoCal).However, Brad Pitt & Philip Seymour Hoffman (he may be underused but he is great nevertheless) are certainly no underdogs. The Mickey Hatcher work here is done by Jonah Hill who soars in his first straight dramatic performance. It is understated & awkward & often very moving & funny because of its total lack of clich√©s. His execution of the role pretty much describes the whole movie.BUT make no mistake about it this is Pitt's film. His quiet confidence & ease carries this film throughout & makes it an enormous pleasure to watch.It may help you if you love baseball as much as I do or smart movie-making because 'Moneyball' is an early Oscar contender.",9,0,3,24 September 2011
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Buzzkill
","This is the 1st big dissappointment of the year. #1: I am not a Tarantino fan (I hated Pulp Fiction, but loved Resevoir Dogs)and #2 KBV1 was probably my favorite movie of '03 (although 21 Grams and Spellbound were really excellent too). What happened? This film is pretentious (whereas V1 was fun and was a MOVIE and not a FILM). This film is a western (whereas V1 was a kung fu movie). This film has a lot to say and little of it is very interesting (whereas V1 had very little to say and most of it was interesting). Much talk, little action. This film is being praised for not being drenched in blood, but it is much uglier (just one turn of a hooker's face or a few closeups of a striking snake will be enough to sell you on that). The red excess in V1 was a marvel to behold. It was Wile E. Coyote violence choreographed to its breezy extreme. The violence in V2 is not fun. And if you are claustrophobic (like me) AVOID this film (Q succeeds all too well in this category in one extended scene -- I couldn't watch it).. The good stuff: David Carradine almost steals this film from Uma (who owned the V1). Darryl Hannah is (like the V1) is fun to watch. Robert Richardson's photography is incredible (like V1). The scenes between Uma and Carradine are intense. Other than that the more I think about about this film the more I dislike it. What a buzzkill.",Null,0,1,17 April 2004
The Incredible Hulk," Much better than expected.
","Edward Norton is right & wrong. This movie could have used more of him in it (when the DVD comes out I hope they include 'his cut' if it exist), but he is wrong for not promoting this movie.This re-boot is a blast to watch. I actually liked much of Ang Lee's version but only in fits & starts. This Hulk is a much smoother machine that never drags. The FX are spectacular & sometimes inspired --every part of the production is great. The battle scenes are ferocious. I never tired of watching Mean Green do his thing, but I guess thats the point. The movie makers knew when to cut the action.However --like Iron Man-- the acting is way above average for this sort of escapism, but, come to think of it, all 3 Spideys & X-Men + Batman Begins (& Returns) also featured really fine & often great acting. AND this Hulk could've used more of it. Norton is 1 of the top 5 actors currently working. There are moments in this movie when his talent really pays off and they are all too brief. William Hurt makes a fine foe. And, so help me movie gods, Liv Tyler gives a memorable performance although she is mostly stuck saying the name 'Bruce'.Overall this movie ROCKS.And I thought all movies released b4 July 18th were just time-killers until the Dark Knight arrives. Thank you Tony Stark, Indy & Bruce Banner for proving me wrong.",8,5,8,15 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It could have been a great movie.
","I work in the TV news business so I was Star Wars-out the day it opened. I love sci-fi movies but even I waited almost 3 weeks to see and stood in line for about 15 seconds. If I had waited any longer than 30 minutes I would've been angry. Star Wars-Episode One:The Phantom Menace played really well when it played to adults. The opening intrigue as Qui-gon and Obi-wan are betrayed is captivating. Their adventures are worthy of the last 3 Star Wars movies, but unfortunately Jar Jar stinks and the kid who plays Annakin cannot act--when he was on with Jay Leno he was great. (Didn't Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard who have elicited great performances by kids and supposedly saw this movie back in April say anything to George?) However inspite of two major flaws '1' soars. Liam Neeson, Ewan MacGregor and Natalie Portman are much better than the so-called 'critics' lead me to believe. The f/x are truly breathtaking (I'm sorry but really special f/x still blow me away after 20 years of serious filmgoing)--especially the backdrops of Naboo and Corascant (sic). The light sabre battle between (an underused) Darth Maul and the 2 Jedis is spectacular. The Senate scenes are a bit talky but plot is interesting and the action scenes are awesome. Lose Jar Jar and the kid and you have a great movie.",7,0,0,24 July 1999
Sucker Punch," Sucker Punched
","The best thing I can say about this movie is that it made me appreciate '300' & 'Watchmen' that much more. ('Watchmen' is a criminally under-rated movie. It is rates w/ 'The Dark Knight' &'The Crow' as maybe the best movie based on a graphic novel ever.)Zack Snyder is a victim of his own talent here. He present us --again-- with stunning visuals, but they don't add up to anything. His 'women in peril' plot seems tired. Most critically I didn't care about any of the characters. The acting is rather by rote. I felt sorry for talents like Jena Malone & Carla Gugino for being stuck inside this candy coated empty shell. You could almost feel Snyder pulling back from delivering a knockout blow in order to deliver a PG-13 rating, but I don't think movie would've have benefited from that added freedom because it seemed so pointless.It may prove to be the biggest disappointment of the year in cinema.",3,1,5,6 August 2011
United 93," Shattering!
","Now there are 4 slots available for the Best Picture Oscar of 2006. Paul Greengrass and his crew have crafted the most nerve tingling (mangling?) thriller since THE CHINA SYNDROME. This retelling of the 9/11/01 and the imagined telling of the final minutes of the the real doomed flight United 93 is one of the most harrowing thrillers of all-time. It almost feels obscene saying that (it is an awesome thriller) because it also an incredible paean to actual real-life heroism (albeit doomed). This may be a perfect movie (as the necessary vodka shot and ale chaser flow through my system). There is not a single false move in this film. The casting is no stars perfect. The cinematography and editing are in perfect sync sometimes to my frustration. I can't believe the restraint Greengrass put on the emotions and the violence. This is very straight forward storytelling. I'm sure the kneejerk suckups at FOXNEWS and the oxycotin addled Limbaugh idiots will find fault with Greengrass's time spent on the terrorists motivations, but I think it added further power to the actions by those against them. THIS IS A GREAT FILM.",10,1,5,29 April 2006
Minority Report," The best sci-fi film since...A.I.
","Let me warn you that A.I. was my favorite film last year. It is still early but this film could very well find itself as my pick for best film of 2002. A.I. is deeply felt. Minority Report is deeply thought. It has a better plot than the classic Bladerunner and the look is just as spectacular. I won't say that is a better film than Bladerunner (yet). Spielberg has done it again by bringing some very hard edges to his style. The world's all-time best director has left warm and fuzzy far behind. His screenwriters have done a great job at staying true to Phillip K. Dick's mind-bending prose. This a plot driven movie with some very cool performances especially in the supporting (and cameo) roles. Tom Cruise is fine as the hunter turned hunted. However Samantha Morton had the most difficult job to pull off as a future telling savant and she definitely should be remembered at Oscar time. Steven Spielberg has rocketed into adulthood since Schindler's List. I still love CE3K, E.T. and Raiders, but Minority joins, Ryan and A.I. as very daring cinema that refuses a safety net. The gadgets and the the eye-candy are less obvious than A.I. but every bit as fantastic. This is a great detective story brilliantly told 52 years from now. If you like Phillip K. Dick and Spielberg rush out to see this movie, but bring your brain. I'm in awe.",10,0,0,26 June 2002
Erin Brockovich," What will next 4 films to get Best Picture nominations next year?
","The first nominees for next year's Oscars in the Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Director, Best Original or Adapted Screenplay and Best Costume Design categories have already been secured with the arrival of 'Erin Brockovich'. Julia Roberts is spectacular in the title role of a hard working single mother who stumbles on one of the biggest corporate wrongs in U.S. history. She would've stole every scene if it wasn't for her co-star Albert Finney who matches her for every point/counterpoint. He plays her reluctant and somewhat befuddled employer who finally joins her fight. Although her box office says otherwise I've always thought Roberts was way overrated as a movie star. Now I'm a believer. She is smart, sassy, foul-mouthed, fiery, sensitive, funny and, of course, very sexy. It is one of best performances I've ever seen by an actress in a lead role and for some reason it reminds me of Susan Sarandon's Annie Savoy from 'Bull Durham' in that both outstanding roles combined real intelligence with real sex appeal. (Of course Annie Savoy is purely fictional whereas Erin Brockovich is not.) I sense that her character may appeal more to men than women (her costume designer obviously had a lot fun working on this film). The reviews I've read have been excellent, but this movie exceeds them largely because the rest of the actors are great as well. Finney's work is more nuanced than Roberts' because it has to be and he provides the perfect foil for her volcanic emotions. Aaron Eckhardt deserves mention too as Roberts' good guy biker boyfriend. These performances are made possible by a superb script from Susannah Grant. Her fact-based tale of a small (hick) town poisoned by a giant utility has 'Rocky'-like satisfactions in it and they feel all earned. The fascinating tale is matched by dialogue that is often fast and furious and very funny and it is in a story that really tugs at your heart strings. Director Steven Soderbergh equals the effort that he put forth with the vastly underrated 'Out Of Sight'. This is an 'adult' movie in the very best sense of that term. 'Erin Brockovich' is definitely a big Hollywood movie with all he fun and rewards that come with it. It also proves that smart entertainment can deal with big issues and make time fly. It is the first Best Picture nominee for next year.",10,1,2,17 March 2000
Unbreakable," Night casts another fantastic spell.
","My expectations for writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's next movie after 'The Sixth Sense' were extremely high and 'Unbreakable' did not let me down. In fact, in some respects, it is a better and more self assured movie than the former. Like '6th', 'Un' is a movie that the less you know about it going in the better it is and I'll be damned if I'm gonna give anything away here. However I will say that Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson (has this guy ever given a bad performance?) are outstanding as the leads. There is not a wasted role in the movie. Shyamalan has concocted another fantastic tale set against urban reality. The spirit of Rod Serling lives in him. His direction and writing are a synergistic blend of moods and spiritualism that resonates deep within your emotions.  He is aided greatly by James Newton Howard's brilliant score and Eduardo Serra's daring cinematography. This movie takes more chances than '6th'. You either buy it or you don't. It has a dream logic that never sacrifices narrative thrust. 'Un' doesn't benefit from '6th''s shock value, but I think is a more accomplished piece overall. It and 'Erin Brokovich are clearly this year's 2 best movies.",10,0,0,12 December 2000
Star Trek," A TERRIFIC Summer movie!
","I've always liked Star Trek but never loved it (except on a few occasions: ST I, Wrath Of Khan & the 'save the whales' movie). People who speak Klingon creep me out.I gotta say that this new Trek was a blast!This re-boot rates up there with Batman Begins & Casino Royale. (It'll be interesting to see if the next Trek will bring us an excellent Dark Knight or a disappointing Quantum.)The casting is great! Zachory Quinto & Karl Urban (remember Bourne's main nemesis in Supremacy?) do a fine job at channeling Spock & McCoy. Whereas Chris Pine puts his own stamp on Kirk & it is a welcome one. It's great to have a sexy Uhura (Zoe Saldana sizzles in the role). The rest of cast is fun to watch too.I don't want to give anything away, but I was happy to see that Leonard Nimoy's presence is much more than a cameo. Eric Bana's villainous rebel Romulan is super intense & almost turns the fun faucet off at times, but I loved it!If you are a sci-fi nut then you will not find the story confusing. The action is whiz-bang & beautifully presented. There is a lot of eye-candy up on the screen.Like last year's Ironman, this is summer entertainment at its best. In fact, I like this new Trek better than Ironman (that final battle in Ironman dragged a bit).This Trek makes you wanting to take another one.",9,3,8,17 May 2009
Fight Club," A very unique and caustic take on Yuppie burnout.
","This was one of top 10 most anticipated movies of 1999 and it didn't let me down. Director David Fincher is at the top of his game for the third in a row with this violent satire  of modern life. The movie is based on a first novel by Chuck Palahniuk. I read his 2nd novel, Survivor, and based on that reading I heard a lot of the author's voice in Fight Club. Palahniuk has a really unique nihlistic world view. Imagine if Alex from Clockwork Orange became a writer then you'd have this guy. Fight Club benefits greatly from Jim Uhls adapted screenplay. It doesn't have gallows humor, it gallows hilarity. David Fincher pulls back from the overt stylism that set Seven and The Game so far apart from other movies to service a story and script that matches him. The movie has style to burn, but it is never immolated by it. Edward Norton is flat out excellent in the lead as the guy who finds salvation in pain. His escape from enervation and ennui is exhilarating and frightening in a funny sort of way. His doppelganger is played by Brad Pitt who really relishes these kind of dark roles and excels in them. Finally there is Helena Bonham Carter who is the tart from Hell and sizzles like frying bacon. This is very strong stuff and I won't blame anybody for hating it. It does drag somewhat in the 2nd half. If you are in the mood for straight shots of tequila and want a movie to match you can't go wrong with this movie.",8,0,1,17 October 1999
Argo," Another step in the right direction for Ben Affleck.
","This just a flat out enjoyable film that crackles with suspense, intrigue, intelligence (literally & figuratively) & some very sly humor. It also may be the year's best film.This outrageous tale of hostage rescue would be impossible to believe if it weren't true & that alone makes it a lot of fun to watch. However the fun is weighted down by the seriousness of what is at stake --real lives in real situations. This is first & foremost a very serious film that doesn't ignore the lunacy of its plot. I can't remember a film that had it both ways -- being both very tense & wickedly funny at times-- & gotten away with it like 'Argo' does.Chris Terrio's script will be studied in film school. Director Affleck has been really good & really really good before ('Gone Baby Gone' & 'The Town' were hugely enjoyable), but here takes another big step forward by taking a wild, woolly, huge story & making it look so easy. The movie begins with a lollapalooza hostile takeover of the U.S. embassy in Iran (a great sequence that tops even the action scenes in 'The Town') then dials that energy down a bit with never losing its tension & momentum. It also pulls off the trick that 'Apollo 13' did by keeping us on edge with a story whose outcome was decided decades ago.On top of all of this are some very good, if not, great work by the actors. Alan Arkin should be a lock for a Supporting Actor nomination & Bryan Cranston should be considered too. Both have the benefit of having some of the best lines in a screenplay full of them & make the most of them. Affleck is suitably restrained as the CIA ex-filtration agent who is the fulcrum of the heroics here. That restraint is key in making his command of the situation believable without question. John Goodman is in fine form as well.I left the theater with a lump in my throat & damp eyes. It is that kind of movie.",9,3,6,14 October 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Darker & Still A Lot Of Fun
","This new ST movie lacks the freshness & surprise factor of the franchise's reboot. (The last ST succeeded way beyond our expectations.)However, it is still a blast to watch. The characters play off each other beautifully, Burt Cumberbatch makes a great villain, the script inverts (subverts?) things in surprising & satisfying ways and there is just the right amount of sly humor to go with your popcorn.I was most surprised by how heavy & philosophical this movie got at times. Star Trek has never tried to hide its humanistic beliefs. That's what has helped make this such a viable & potent franchise over ALL of these years & virtually forced its resurrections by it fan base. (BTW: I don't call myself a Trekkie --Trekker?-- not that there is anything wrong with that.)The negative backlash is unwarranted & it definitely has a right to exist. All I know is that I got my money's worth of way above entertainment.",8,3,6,27 May 2013
Public Enemies," Strangely underwhelming
","Maybe this movie suffers from comparisons with THE HURT LOCKER which I had seen 2 days earlier, but I found this highly anticipated movie static & unmoving.How could you go wrong with putting down $7.50 seeing Michael Mann direct a period gangster piece with Johnny Depp & Christian Bale going toe to toe? (By unable to stop the constant urge to compare it to a non-stop intense movie about an Army bomb squad in Iraq?) Because this movie like his last one, Miami VICE, never really gets going. It has fine performances: Depp as Dillinger, Cotillard as his dame & Bale as G-Man Melvin Purvis are all very good. However my favorite performance was Billy Crudup who gives 'his' J. Edgar Hoover a wicked effeminate flair. (Forgive me --or not-- for not enjoying Hoover played as bit of a poofter.) Mann is not a grab you by the throat artist (like Paul Greengrass or, evidently, Kathryn Bigelow). His best films (THIEF, THE INSIDER, HEAT, COLLATERAL) seduce you. This one doesn't although it tries very hard.Like all Mann movies, PUBLIC ENEMIES, is put together with a great deal of care, informed with great intelligence (that even permeated his pulp masterpiece COLLATERAL) & has atmosphere to burn. It just doesn't quite come together as anything more than occasionally involving. Also the digital photography ruined some shots (it worked in COLLATERAL, but it didn't work in ...VICE & it doesn't work here).Mann has hit grand slams before, but this movie results in a ground rule double.",7,1,2,8 July 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," Maybe the BEST action movie ever made!
","This 3rd Bourne is the best of the 3 and I give Identity a 9/10 and SUPREMACY a 10/10.This movie starts huge and never ever lets up. It is smartly cast, beautifully performed (CAN WE GET SOME Oscar NOMS for Matt Damon and Joan Allen?), breathlessly paced, wonderfully shot/filmed and intelligently scripted and on and on and on.The Bourne movies have really separated themselves from the rest of pack (save for the last Bond film which wisely echoed a Bourne film), because we care intensely about this deeply complex man. I don't find myself exactly rooting, er, cheering (sorry Aussie film nuts), for him. He has done some very nasty things. Nevertheless Bourne is unequivocally one of the most memorable characters in cinematic history.And what new superlatives can we use to praise Paul Greengrass? His last 4 films have been BLOODY Sunday, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, last year's best movie UNITED 93 and now this one. Greengrass is at the top of his field by a clear margin. Just when you think movies can't get anymore exciting along comes ULTIMATUM and it is never at the expense of the human drama. The new DIE HARD, TRANSFORMERS and 300 had some amazing set pieces in them but this film's action slays anything in those movies. It is almost too much. I just hope Oscar finally rewards his work and his movies. 'They' really missed it last year with 93. BUT then again I don't care because I had a GREAT time watching this 3rd Bourne.THANK YOU PAUL GREENGRASS, Matt Damon and everyone else involved in the production of this movie --you too, Moby.",10,2,4,7 August 2007
Man of Steel," Super-charged, over the top, the 'S' stands for 'WOW!'
","I don't get the venom being spewed at this movie. Evidently I saw a different movie.The movie I saw is called 'Man Of Steel'. It is an intelligent & very well thought out movie that has all the hallmarks that made 'Batman Begins' such a pleasure --an 'origins story' that has never been explored in the depth that it is here.Quickly:---Henry Cavill is great in the title role -even better than Christopher Reeve. Cavill & the 2 kids who portray the young Clark never hit a false note. It'll be interesting to see how he does when he has to wear the fake glasses more as the barely glimpsed grown up Clark Kent.---Michael Shannon as Gen. Zod is ferocious & driven. I've really liked Shannon for a long time. He delivers another Shannon-esque performance.---the rest of the cast is excellent: Crowe is Crowe, Amy Adams is the best Lois Lane ever, Kevin Costner, Dianne Lane & Laurence Fishburne all have crucial moments that they matches some of the best work they've ever done.---David Goyer's screenplay from a story he conceived along with the legendary Christopher Nolan may be the best & most thought out of any of the 'super-hero movies'.---Zack Snyder brings this all together with the confidence it needed to pull it off. His visual gifts are on FULL display. There were times when I couldn't help to smile in delightful awe at the stuff his team was putting before my eyes. ('The Bourne Identity' shot that pulls back to reveal humpback whales swimming above a drifting Clark was a hoot.)---The only knock I have about this movie is that is does get a bit overwhelming more than a few times. The action scenes raise the bar for these things so high that you lose sight of the ground on a few occasions. (Maybe the 3D IMAX didn't help.) I'd rather see a movie that gives me too much rather than too little. However this movie never dragged for a single second.It isn't aimed at kids. This is Superman for adults, but it is not nearly as dark as Nolan's Batman Trilogy.If this is not the best movie of this genre then it certainly belongs in the Top 5 (along with Snyder's vastly under-appreciated 'Watchmen').",10,4,10,17 June 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," WOW! By far the best sequel to a sequel ever!
","I almost feel guilty for liking this movie so much. Who'd have thought that T3 without James Cameron's involvement could be anything slightly better than average? But T3 is not only a 10 on the 'summer escapist movie' scale it is also a 9 on any other scale unless your idea of a great movie is Moulin Rouge or The Hours. Johnathan Mostow has taken the reins from Cameron for a Mach2 gallop. This movie is funny, lighter and as muscular as ever despite its much shorter length. An early chase scene is better than anything ever seen on the big screen (sorry French Connection and Reloaded) and although it is the high point of the movie T3 maintains the steam built up by it-- which I found astonishing. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are very welcome additions to the T-mythos. Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor is almost not missed here (her fate is nicely handled) and Edward Furlong's John Connor is not missed at all. Arnold is in fine and, sometimes finer, form. Kristanna Loken doesn't have the acting chops of Robert Patrick, but her TX is an advancement over his T1000. Give everybody credit. The tech credits are as good, if not better, than the last 2 Ts. The real surprise is the story and the writing. On close analysis T3 may seem like a rehash or mismash of the T1&2 and it may not make any logical sense. So what? Count the calories in your next pizza and beer combo. Be a buzzkill. All I know is that I cared about the characters and what was happening to them. I was caught up in the story. T3 is as much fun as you'll ever have at movie.",9,1,1,6 July 2003
American Beauty," An absolutely dark and beautiful film.
","This is an amazing piece of work and it probably tops 'The Insider', 'The Sixth Sense', 'EdTV' and 'Bringing Out The Dead' as my favorite film of the year. Alan Ball's screenplay is one the modern wonders of the world and Sam Mendes's direction matches it (I can see why he bested Michael Mann as the L.A. Film Critics director of the year). Where did these guys come from? This story of an American family and the tiny slice of the world they live in is unspooled before us with the precision and fascination of a geneticist unravelling a strand of DNA through an electron microscope. This is not to suggest that the film is cold (far from it). It just felt like I was watching the characters lives from beneath their skins. Rarely have I felt like I knew an entire cast so well. This will be a hard movie to reward at Oscar time because every single performance hit exactly the right key ('L.A. Confidential' had the same problem), but obviously Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning should lead actor noms. Spacey has played laconic many times before (I can't think of a film where he hasn't been this way before), but not with the dry wit and comic timing he displays here. Even when he blows up it is dry. Benning has her best role since 'The Grifters' and makes the most it. She is a Stepford wife with real ambition. They are a married couple who long ago gave up on the American Dream but are too comfortable to give up the Amercian Facade and this is Ball's key contempt. It is a very unique view. While the adults know that they are screwed up the kids still fight to have hope. It is their rebellion. Thora Burch is outstanding as the lone child of Spacey and Benning who is getting killed by her parents' cynicism. The most frightening performance is given by Wes Bentley as the next door neighbor kid who is constantly peeping and taping other people's lives, but also finding beauty amid the ugliness and chaos in some of the film's most moving scenes (a lot people will not get the significance and meaning of the paper bag, but those who do understand the film completely --I thought is was awesome). I think he is acting as the filmakers. Finally Mena Suvari is a revelation as the smart-ass and all-knowing teenage friend who reveals a heartbreaking vulnerability. This film is very dark but like 'Bringing Out The Dead' there is a redemptive quality leaves you with hope at the end. I was floored by this. It is also a very funny film. American Beauty may be the best film of a very good year.",10,0,0,13 December 1999
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," John C and Laugh Hard
","3/4ths of this movie is some of the best movie-making you'll see all year and the 1/4th that isn't (the 3rd quarter post-Beatles part) doesn't sink it because it ends on a high note.John C. Reilly is close to spectacular in the title role. Jake Kasdan, Judd 'what-a-year-he-has-had' Apatow, the supporting cast (including a slew of great cameos) and especially the people responsible for the songs have crafted an almost too-smart-for-its-own-good satire of popular music since Bill Haley and music movie bios (which I've never been a fan of).When this comedy works it is as good as BOB ROBERTS (without the dread that some pol someday won't adopt that character as a blueprint for running a campaign someday --maybe Barack already has sans the guitar and the conservative fascism --and, please, don't tell that there is no such thing as liberal fascism --just google David Geffen) and THANK YOU FOR SMOKING (without it political acuteness).The crazy thing about this movie is that I can't wait to buy the music CD from it. The songs are superbly crafted and they are funnier than hell. 'Let's Duet' is as dirty as Springsteen's 'Pink Cadillac' and it is a bit more obvious.WARNING: this movie earns its R-rating for the right reasons.",8,4,9,25 December 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Remarkable Remake
","The novel & the Swedish movie are not great by any standards (they are pretty damn good), but the 'Girl', Lisbeth Salander & Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth are great anti-heroines.I'm not surprised that David Fincher made a better movie than the original. Fincher is at the top of his game here. 'The Social Network', 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' & 'Se7en' are better movies because the source material is better.The shock here is Rooney Mara as Salander. Rapace was electric as Salander in all 3 movies made from the Millennium trilogy. Mara is slightly better. In either incarnation you cannot tear your eyes away from the screen when Salander appears, but there something about Mara's work that runs a bit deeper than Rapace's & I'll have to see this film again to get a better handle on that.Another shock is that this 'Americanized' version is a harder 'R' than the Euro version. This ain't a date movie.Of course Daniel Craig is perfect as Blomkvist. Christopher Plummer is perfect as Vanger. Stellan Stelsgard (sic) briefly channels Joe Doe in a key scene. Steven Zallian's is more true to the novel despite a non-important tweak of the ending.Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross's music is mesmerizing meriting a 2nd Oscar for them. Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography is worthy of the best of his late father's work. The opening title sequence is sick, twisted & brilliant with Karen O's ferocious singing charging it.The movie flags a bit in the last 15 minutes, but then ends with a bittersweet & deeply felt sigh.This is very rough stuff meant only for the serious film lover who make up all of Fincher's admirers.",9,2,7,24 December 2011
Batman Begins," Nolan, Goyer and Christian Bale Batman out of Goofham.
","Having seen this film a 2nd time only confirms my initial take on it. This is an angry, ferocious, intelligent and thoroughly adult Batman. However it is a warmer film the 2nd time around. When Nolan was announced as the director to resurrect the Bat a couple of years ago I was thrilled. I knew he wouldn't screw it up. Let's face it the excellent MEMENTO and INSOMNIA weren't exactly laugh riots. The thoughtfulness that made those films what they are make BATMAN BEGINS what it is. Before we declare it the best film based on comic book character or story we must remember THE CROW. Bale is perfect as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He is brooding, tortured and deadly serious, but (like Brandon Lee as Eric Draven/The Crow) there is a real soulfulness in his work. He and Russell Crowe (from the greatly under-appreciated Cinderella MAN--the other great film of '05) dominate but never steal, the screen when they are on it. Also I loved Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldham (refreshingly playing a good guy) and Morgan Freeman. There is not a single sour note in any work here and, yes, I think Tom Wilkinson as Falcone does a fine job. This is a film for the mind and the eye. Like Cinderella MAN the riches here are very abundant. When I was 1st blown away by Frank Miller's revisionist Batman in 'The Dark Knight Returns' (and it unfairly maligned sequel), BATMAN BEGINS was how I hoped Batman would be translated to the big screen. BATMAN RETURNS came close (thanks to Keaton, Pfieffer and DeVito), but this Bat even blows that one away. This film has as much Frank Miller in it (along with some Alan Moore) as Miller's own SIN CITY. BATMAN BEGINS is astonishing. Note to Christopher Nolan and David Goyer: if you can pull off an R-rating I loved to see 'The Killing Joke'.",10,0,0,26 June 2005
Drive," Stuck in idle.
","This is a movie that aspires to be a great nilhlistic existential thrill ride into oblivion & falls well short of its aims. But maybe I'm mistaken thinking this film has any aspirations. I kept waiting for 'Drive' to rev up & it never really did. It has one pretty cool chase scene & a couple of other OK ones --stuff we've seen done much better in the 'Bourne' movies, 'The French Connection', 'To Live & Die In L.A.', etc. It's like watching 'Vanishing Point' never arriving at a point.'Drive' has none.The key problem is its lead. Ryan Gosling zombies through it all focused like a cat staring intently at some phantom object that none of us can see except this film's true believers who praise this movie like it's in the same class as 'Heat' or 'Collateral'. There is a scene in which he puts on a rubber mask that has no real facial features & it conveyed the same amount of nuances & emotions that a maskless Gosling had been sharing with us all along.A big deal has been made out of Albert Brook's turn at villainy. Like just about everything else here, Brook's is okay. (I'll take Paul Reiser's sleazeball in 'Aliens' or Robin William's chilling dryness in 'Insomnia' way over this.)I felt bad for Carey Mulligan. Her soft edges never played off Gosling's blankness the way I think they were intended to. It makes me want to watch 'Never Let Me Go' again.And a key part of the soundtrack was lifted directly from last year's Oscar winning score for 'The Social Network'.'Drive' steal from a lot of better genre films & it doesn't do it well.",Null,6,13,5 November 2011
The Bourne Legacy," If this had been the 1st Bourne...
","If any movie deserves a Medal of Valor or an 'A' for Effort this year I doubt there'll be a movie any more deserving than this one.TBL is a really cool movie that is a lot of fun to watch, really well acted & directed. The script is convoluted but so what? It's not like the other 'Bourne' films were lessons in straight ahead plotting & that is part of their appeal. You must pay attention to them.Renner is an excellent choice to carry the 'Bourne' DNA. In this movie the best plot twist is that he does it & very well. Rachell Weisz is the other best addition to the 'Bourne' mythos. She is a lot of fun to watch.The set pieces are waaay better than I thought they'd be. The sci-fi element is totally plausible & welcome.HOWEVER, Paul Greengrass & Matt Damon raised the bar so high in the 2 prior Bourne movies you had to know that it couldn't be beat. It isn't here & not due to lack of effort.There are nuances that Damon brought to character --a certain wistfulness, melancholy, doomed acceptance-- that Renner got better at capturing as this movie went on. This is Renner's best role since 'The Town' & he makes a lot of it.I guess the thing I miss most about this version of the legacy is what drives a lot of people nuts about director Paul Greengrass. I love his style of directing. His unfairly maligned visceral style really keeps me on the edge of my seat & joyfully off-balance. That jittery feeling is mostly lacking here & ergo about half of the adrenaline rush --but miraculously only half.If you can separate TBL from the other 'Bournes' then this is a movie that rates higher than the 7 stars I give it.",7,9,15,20 August 2012
The Hurt Locker," As explosive as its subject.
","Without a doubt this is the best war film since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (& I loved BLACK HAWK DOWN & FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS). It is intense & continuously involving. This is Bigelow's best film since (the classic) NEAR DARK.If the subject, Army bomb squad in Iraq, doesn't intrigue you then you probably think that 'Shakespeare In Love' really did deserve it Best Picture Oscar.The acting is excellent throughout but there is a star making performance by Jeremy Renner that will leave you stunned. It was smart to cast this film with mostly actors that you don't recognize.The movie has a documentary feel to it which adds greatly to the tension in it. DP Barry Ackroyd also shot the unnerving UNITED 93. The editing is virtually perfect. You know exactly where you are at in the rubble strewn streets where life fights like weeds in cracked concrete to take hold (again). And the shots never linger too long (or too short).Bigelow has always given us beautifully stylized scenes, but except for one very effective slo-mo shot she seems to have sacrificed that trait for the story (or shooting schedule). It doesn't look like 'a Kathryn Bigelow film'. But few films rise above their script. Mark Boal's screenplay is a lesson on how to tell a great story with a minimum of exposition. The characters are defined almost entirely by their actions. I hope the Oscars reward this movie well.I drove 112 miles to Sherman Oaks to see it & it was worth it. I can't wait to see it again.Update January 2010: This film is even better on a 2nd viewing. It is just as intense (amazingly). I noticed much more character development this time around. The acting & script retain their original luster I was wrong about it not really looking like 'a Bigelow film' because it does. There is no other film-maker that sees things quite like she does. If you missed in the cinemas don't fret; it plays just as well on a decent home screen (my 32' flat screen was just fine).",10,56,118,8 July 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Underwhelming
","Geez, I was looking forward to this movie!The Silver Surfer is as cool as Batman and Wolverine and probably cooler.The 1st F4 movie was better than I expected. It wasn't a great movie but it was fun. It was a nice departure from angst driven BATMAN BEGINS, X-MEN & SPIDER-MAN movies which I love. But it is OK to simply like something and F4 was something I liked.BUT nevertheless I was hoping that RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER would approach the excellence of BATMAN BEGINS, the X-MEN movies and all 3 SPIDEYS.It didn't.The Surfer is very cool to watch but is the ONLY reason to catch this new F4. Whatever misgivings you had about miscasting the F4 are glaringly apparent more than ever here. Jessica Alba is simply not Susan Storm (anymore than she is Nancy in SIN CITY). The guy who plays Dr. Doom should simply come with his own cue cards to flash on the screen to tell the audience what to feel.This is great stuff for 8 year olds! Period!And c'mon guys if your gonna have Galactus in the movie don't depict him as an outtake from TWISTER!If The Silver Surfer gets his own movie I'll see it only if Tim Story is too busy with adapting Sesame Street to the big screen.",5,1,3,25 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A rich, generous Christmas present to anybody who truly loves movies --their art & their power.
","('Til today I thought TDK was going to the best movie of '08.)Make no mistake about it this is David Fincher's best film! ...Button has all the power of Seven but for entirely different emotional reasons.This is a warm, thoughtful, thought-provoking, heart breaking, uplifting example of what happens when great writing meets visual artistry.The only thing I'll say about about the story is that it is about the love of Life & Death & Love. Those of you who --like me-- who were looking for the ultimate Twilight Zone episode will not be disappointed. It is a love story. It has a love of language. It is complex. It is beautifully acted. It breathes (it is nearly 3 hours long because it had to be). It uses lightning as a punchline over & over again to great effect.Fincher has always been a Michaelangelo, a Rembrandt, a DaVinci when it comes to visuals & he at the height of his powers here. If you are not seduced by what you see then Button may bore you. There are frames in this film that I could stare at for long, long minutes rather than the few seconds that they appear on screen.HOWEVERNo movie works if the story doesn't grab you. Obviously this one has it. Visuals aside, it is a delight to listen to as well as look at.The performances from a large cast lead by Brad Pitt & Cate Blanchett are wonderful.I've read some early reviews that the movie is ultimately cold --a common Fincher rap. It has Fincher's trademark intellect (if he hasn't trademarked it yet, he should). IT IS NOT COLD. It has the emotional power of a tugboat bring in a wrecked liner.Others criticize Button for being too much of a good thing & that it has too many elements & it does. And I'd rather have a film try too hard then try too little.You had to wonder why they waited until Christmas Day to release this film. The answer arrives when you see it because it is the only day they could have released it. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is Santa's (and Fincher & crew') present to people who truly love movies.",10,15,26,25 December 2008
Lincoln," Memorial worthy movie making.
","Steven Spielberg, America's greatest movie director, has made over 20 feature films. He's had a few misses, but mostly he's been very good to excellent & he's had a few outright classics & 'Lincoln' is one of those classics.Daniel Day-Lewis gives one of those very few hype-proof performances. No matter how much praise you have heard about his portrayal of the 16th President Of The United States you are still not quite prepared for it (reminding me of Heath Ledger's work as 'The Joker' in this regard). His Lincoln is very lived in, worn but not worn down, looking like the weight of the nation is upon his shoulders & looking strong enough to bear up under it. He's funny, warm, calculating, coarse, smarter than most, but wise enough to know he doesn't have all the answers. He has a code that will not break. Day-Lewis's turns in a performances that rates alongside Pacino's Michael Corleone & Ledger's villainous turn as my all-time favorite.However there are other great performances in this film, most notably by Tommy Lee Jones as a crucial ally to get the 13th Amendment passed during the final weeks of Lincoln's life that the film covers. Every key actor in this prodigious cast has a moment or two that stuns.None of this is possible without a script by Tony Kushner that may even surpass Day-Lewis's work. It features more than a few speeches written with a love of the language--of English & the English of that time-- rarely heard anywhere in America & they are often thrillingly delivered by a cast up to the challenge. It is also rich in irony (I don't think the Democratic Party during this period would've won the 'black vote'.) So all that Spielberg has to do is yell 'Action!' & 'Cut!'. Of course it's not that simple. The great gift of a great director is to know how much guidance is needed to get the job done. There are no obvious Spielberg moments here (like another Kushner scripted movie, 'Munich', that he directed), but you know that you're in the hands of a cinematic master.John Williams' score is subtle. Michael Kahn's cutting let the moments breathe without ever dragging out too long. Janusz Kaminski has said that he merely let his cinematography 'serve the story', but he's being a bit too humble. His shots are a stunning parade of shadows & natural light. They don't call attention themselves but, nevertheless, it is a beautiful movie to watch. The set design, costumes, art direction & everything else are Oscar worthy.'Lincoln' isn't a movie you 'should' see (although you should) it is a movie you'll want to see. Despite it lack of physical action it is every bit as entertaining as 'Argo' & 'The Dark Knight Rises'.",10,5,17,21 November 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Gory, ridiculous and joyous to watch.
","I avoided seeing this film because most of the critics only talked about how much blood was spilled in this movie and I'm not a Texas Chainsaw Massacre type of guy, but my friends kept telling me that this movie rocked. So I finally saw it. Screw the pinhead intellectuals Kill Bill is sick. It is the bomb. This is Quentin Tarantino's 4th and best movie. I loved Resevoir Dogs, found Pulp Fiction obese (I hated it) and can't even name his 3rd film. Any movie that opens up with a Klingon proverb announces that it not to be taken seriously. What is shocking is the passion, effort and care that is evident on the screen in making this non-serious masterpiece. There was very serious work involved here. The action scenes are way over the top but beautifully executed. They are as gory as anything I've ever seen this side of Braveheart, but it is fun. The quiet scenes are sly and the dialogue is smart. What this movie lacks in emotion is more than compensated by intrigue. You want to know know what is going to happen next. You don't want to overthink this movie because it is so much fun to watch. If Mystic River is the best film this year then Kill Bill: Vol. 1 may be the best movie of the year. I can't wait for Vol. 2.",9,0,1,2 November 2003
Mission: Impossible II," Sub-Woo effort, but better than the first one.
","Robert Towne wrote this thing? And he wrote Chinatown? What serious brain illness is he suffering from?  This is a seriously misguided effort that tries to turn Tom Cruise into James Bond. It waste the usually scene-stealing talents of Ving Rhames. After seeing Dougray Scott seethe menacingly and ineffectively I'm glad he didn't get the Wolverine role in X-Men. Only Thandie Newton breathed any fire into her role as a sexy double-dealing agent. And of course even a subpar effort by director John Woo is always interesting. There is some terrific action here, but we've seen it all before. The movie rip-offs the astonishing Face/Off and he excellent The Matrix (which rip-offed Woo for great effects). It substituted loud music for real suspense and I'm getting sick of stop/quick/slow/jagged motion editing effects. But above I didn't care who lived or died and the story sucked. Of course I'm writing this with Titanic on the tube playing on HBO for the 1000th time. MI:2 is slightly better than Broken Arrow.",2,0,0,3 June 2000
The Insider," What 'All The President's Men' was to newspaper journalism, this movie is to TV journalism.
","This film is unavoidably being compared to director Alan J. Pakula's 'All The President's Men' and for good reason, because Michael Mann's new film is every bit as good. (Anybody is the TV news biz -like me- knows that newspaper and TV news are very different animals.) 'The Insider' is a very mature film. It takes its sweet time letting the events unfold. However Mann and his team use very cinematic trick in the book to hold our attention and the editing is impeccable. But first and foremost the film features 2 virtuoso performances: one by a master we've grown accustomed to and one by a guy who may have joined his league. Of course I'm talking about Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Pacino adds another mammoth blast in his Hall of Fame collection of home run performances. His portrayal of 60 Minutes producer gives him a lot of room to use all his skills as an actor and he never ever looks like an actor acting. He vents anger and frustration better than any actor I've ever seen and he is given the chance to do so here. Now on to the 'new' guy. Anybody who has seen Russell Crowe before (especially in his Oscar-worthy effort in 'L.A. Confidential') is not surprised that he can more than hold his own against Pacino, but then again acting is not a sporting event and there is room for a lot of winners in a movie like this. Crowe's role as 'the guy' who blows the whistle on the tobacco industry is a fascinating study of a man imploding. Not since Pacino's work in 'The Godfather II' have I've seen it done so well. Like every other thing Mann has done the supporting actors are great too, but the standout here is Christopher Plummer's Mike Wallace who has to reluctantly sell out to the corporate bottom line. The story about a guy who wants to go public about a major public health crime but is abandoned by a major network is complex and difficult stuff, but Mann and co-scripter Eric Roth do a magnificent job at keeping it clear and interesting. It is riveting and important entertainment. Like the phrase 'TV journalism', 'important entertainment' may seem like a contradiction of terms, but not with this movie which is one the best films of the year.",10,0,0,7 November 1999
The Dark Knight," The Darkest Knight
","Watch out what you wish for, it might come true.I wanted another Batman that was as deadly serious as 'Batman Begins'. I wanted a Joker like the one from Frank Miller's 'The Dark Knight Returns' & Alan Moore's 'The Killing Joke'. I wanted Harvey Dent.'The Dark Knight' grants these wishes almost too well. It is a very troubling movie where our hero fights the good fight only to see the fight get bigger and murkier in every round. This is mythical stuff --Nordic myth!This film --this work of cinematic art-- set a real bad buzz in my head as I walked out of the theatre utterly silent and somewhat uncomprehending. I was depressed and still am 24 hours later (though it is wearing off).TDK gets better & better the more you think about it.The performances are universally top notch, but, of course, the performance that everybody is talking about is Heath Ledger's The Joker.Whatever you've heard & whatever you've read cannot prepare you for what you experience. If Javier Bardem can win an Oscar for his bad guy turn then Ledger's Oscar is a sure lock. It is elementary. The Joker's misanthropy is beyond --maybe, way beyond-- that of Hannibal Lecter, Alex Defarge, John Doe & Keyser Sose. Of course, he will probably not get even nominated. The tragedy of his death lies (in part) in this incendiary work. Thank You Chris & Johnathan Nolan & David Goyer and the rest of your top notch crew for the nerve to take the Batman to this very dark place.It is tough movie to watch --experience. It is almost to much of a very bad thing. BUT WOW! You (plural) have created a masterpiece!",10,2,5,21 July 2008
Into the Wild," One of the best book-to-film adapts ever!
","After finally getting around to reading the book I couldn't wait to see the movie and did so within a couple of hours.So with the astonishing book very fresh in my memory I was somewhat apprehensive about how I could enjoy the movie --if at all.And I am not one of those whiners who always complain that the book is never as good as the movie. That is BS because a lot of times the movie makers get it right (think The Dead Zone & Jaws & Clockwork Orange, All The President's Men & Eight Men Out + others). And when they get it wrong the stench can almost strangle you (think The Choirboys & Semi-Tough).That's another topic for another day.This is a deeply felt, beautifully rendered & thought-provoking movie. Emile Hirsch nails the enigmatic Chris McCandless who is, of course, the privileged son who leaves it 'all' behind to find himself in the Alaskan wilds. It is a tough role because the way his McCandless is described in the book there isn't a wide range of emotions he outwardly expresses. There is almost a blankness to him that could have vaporized into thin air, BUT it doesn't and that allows you to ponder & perhaps project your own thoughts onto his inner journey outwardly bound. The other performances are top-notch. However HaL Holbrook's work here should have got him the Oscar.Whatever you think of Sean Penn's politics should have absolutely no bearing on your thoughts about his handling of this material. He hits all the right notes as a director. Who does he think he is? Clint Eastwood?This film moves along covering a surprising amount of ground and yet I never felt short-changed. Like the book, this film is potent & introspective stuff. Both will touch your mind & your heartRead the book before or after the movie.Note to Mr. Penn: you know that there is another Krakauer book begging for proper big-screen treatment and it may take you even higher in the directors' ranks.(And I thought The Bourne Ultimatum, American Gangster, Michael Clayton, Eastern Promises & Knocked Up were the 5 best films of '07.)",10,0,2,23 December 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Still the best film of all-time.
","This was the movie that made me fall in love with movies --needless to say it also my all-time favorite. 2001 is a movie that demands that you watch it and not listen to it. It refuses to spell out what is going on although it has a perfectly coherent plot. Its ending is debatable only to those who can't make up their minds(I think it is all about Man's transcendence --as opposed to evolution-- into the next level of existence). It is a film for right-brained --i.e. non-verbal, non-linear-- thinkers. 2001 is more than 30 years old and like all classic films has the freshness of today's latest release. Even the f/x have held up over time. I think the 'Voyage Beyond Infinity' sequence ranks as one of the top 5 f/x sequences ever. I was 14 years old when I first saw it (about 5 years after it was first released) and I don't think I've ever fully returned from it. (This movie was the most powerful 'say NO to drugs' statement ever made to me.) There have only been a handful of films over years that can be classified as 'pure cinema' and 2001 is the best of them.",10,1,3,9 October 1998
Elysium," A fine & worthy follow up to 'District 9'
","The problem with Neill Blomkamp's last film was that it came from absolutely nowhere for paying people like me & floored us. Obviously. we all asked how was he going follow that act?The answer to that question is 'pretty damn well'. 'Elysium' gives him bigger stars & a bigger set of toys to work with & probably gives his buddy, Sharlto Copley, a bigger paycheck.This is a constantly entertaining BIG sci-fi film filled great visuals, interesting characters & a very satisfying story with as much political subtlety as a Michael Moore film.So what if Jodie Foster is rather one-dimensional as a villainous 'suit' (think 'Avatar's' Quaritch wearing Armani)? She makes that one dimension very entertaining. Matt Damon may not be Bourne-terrific here but he is fine form nevertheless. His 'Max' has a story we actually care about. The two standout performances here are Wagner Moura as the computer ace, Spider & Copley as the hit-man/machine/sociopath/mercenary, Kruger. Unlike the two idiot scientist who almost ruined 'Pacific Rim' for me, Moura has fun with the role without ever making fun of the role. There is hardly any humor in this movie, but that doesn't make it a downer. Copley has a voice & a way of speaking that I'm sure seems very strange to anybody living in the western half of the U.S. As he showed in 'District 9' & the terrific 'Europa Report'(his other 'E' sci-fi movie this summer) he has a unique screen presence that always holds our attention. I don't know if this makes him a particularly good actor, but he is fun to watch. Kruger is written as a scary guy & Copley makes him one.Blomkamp keeps things moving at a fast pace that never seems rushed. There is only one fight scene that seems a bit like overkill (unlike just about all the fight scenes in 'Man Of Steel' -which I otherwise loved). There is fairly bloody stuff going on throughout this movie. One scene nearly matches the infamous self-abortion in 'Prometheus'. The gore flashes in front of you quickly & never lingers. Just keep the kids home.This movie is probably not going to go over very well with people who keep their bank accounts on the Cayman Islands, but for the rest of us it is rollicking entertainment",8,2,3,20 August 2013
Avatar," James Cameron is now the 'king of another world'!
","Say what you will about AVATAR, but there is no avoiding it. It is truly one of the best & most unique movie experiences I've ever had. Of course this was the 1st time I've ever seen a movie in 3-D + IMAX combined.I still think that THE HURT LOCKER is the best film of the year only because it is THAT good. Both are (& will become) classics.AVATAR stands in a class completely by itself. More than 2 days later I'm still buzzing about it. Comparisons to the rush that STAR WARS gave you are entirely accurate.The best thing that Cameron did with the 3-D is that he never shoves it at you. He (+ the 1000 or so other magicians who worked on this movie) allows you to wander into each frame (is that word even applicable here?) & become surrounded by it. It is a totally immersive feeling. The camera movement is not content with being locked down. It moves to give you further perspective of the amazing world before you. The tech achievements are astounding & I could on & on about 'performance capture' & its success only to say that I felt that the Na'vi --the blue people-- were every bit as real as the humans.The story is somewhat predictable & there's nothing in the performances that'll rock you like Jeremey Renner's work in '...Locker' (although Stephen Lang is quite good as the hard core military guy). But the actors & the script rise enough to make you really care about what happens to them. Zoe Saldana's Na'vi beauty & spirit is quite something to marvel at (what a year she has had with this & Uhura)when you later think that she was basically digital.It may not be the 'movie of the year' but, contrarily, make no mistake about it AVATAR is the movie EVENT of the decade.",10,6,13,22 December 2009
Eyes Wide Shut," I was underwhelmed.
","Like any serious student of film for me 'Eyes Wide Shut' was easily the most anticipated film of the year and maybe the decade. Stanley Kubrick directed my favorite film of all-time, '2001', another Top 10, 'A Clockwork Orange', and all-time classics, 'Dr.Strangelove...', 'Paths Of Glory' and 'Full Metal Jacket'. But alas EWS falls far short of those dizzying high points. It begins brilliantly with a fascinating and dreamy party where the psycho-sexual landscape is set up as precisely as a chessboard and the play is engaged between Dr. Harford and his wife Alice. The opening moves are typical Kubrick and therefore masterful, but then it devolves into a game I really didn't care about. The much talked about orgy scene looks like it came from Red Shoes Diaries. There are some great looking bodies in it (even in the altered US version --which is another story in itself), but what was intended to be shocking was less adventurous than things we've seen on HBO's Real Sex series. I didn't care about Harford and his wife. Tom Cruise does well with what he can in his role but like most of Kubrick's main characters he is an icon rather than a real person. Stanley has gotten away with this more than any other director in history, but here it doesn't work. Nicole Kidman is the best thing about the movie but she dissappears in the second half of it except to come on in time to utter what will go down as one of the most memorable closing lines ever. Kubrick's death is a huge loss for film and filmgoers. His passing hit me harder far more than Di, JFK Jr. and John Lennon, but it doesn't make EWS more than a better than average movie. I would've love to have seen AI.",6,0,0,22 July 1999
The Da Vinci Code," A classy and very faithful adaptation.
","After re-reading the book a month ago, I walked into this movie a bit leery how it would be treated on screen despite my faith in Ron Howard who is 1 of my 3 favorite directors (Spielberg, of course, and Chris Nolan being the other 2). But Howard gives us another very entertaining and smart movie. Dan Brown must be very happy. He should be. This is one of the most faithful movie adaptations ever. Nothing of any importance was left out and the movie benefits by turning intriguing words and ideas words into beautiful and often emotionally moving pictures plus the performances are top notch. It is very nicely cast. Audrey Tatou is the standout here. Tom Hanks gets better and better as the movie goes along (and at over 2 and 1/2 hours it goes a long way). In fact this movie gets better as it goes along. It picks up an emotional weight near the end that the book didn't give me. The writing and the editing are superb. It is a bit talky at times, but it never dragged. Whatever you feel about the book is how you'll feel about the movie. (I would actually give the book 8/10 or slightly lower than the movie.) For Ron Howard fans this isn't APOLLO 13 or Cinderella MAN, but it is close.",9,4,7,25 May 2006
Zero Dark Thirty," All The President's Men At War
","(First off I'll say that anybody giving this film less than 7/10 is a f**king idiot although the 1st Amendment stills applies to y'all. Go back to GlenBeckistan & wait for Ahnuld's new movie.)Kathryn Bigelow/Mark Boal's follow up to their Oscar winning 'The Hurt Locker' is as tightly focused as that intense thriller but not nearly as exciting because it paints a much broader canvas over a much greater amount of time.This film reminds me of Alan J. Pakula's 1976 film 'All The President's Men'in pacing, tone & brains. ZDT is a procedural depicting digging for clues & evidence discovery. It invites the audience to go along on the process that includes trust issues & backing off & pushing on. Though it may not be as flat entertaining as the excellent 'Argo' (& 'Lincoln') it is very compelling material that Bigelow expertly depicts.I think that Jessica Chastain is fantastic as Maya who drives the whole 'hunt for Bin Laden' along at some great personal costs. Her face often captures the pain that goes along with the gain.Bigelow & Boal treat the audience as adults --smart adults-- by not spelling out everything in bold capital letters & black & white. The climatic raid that finally gets UBL plays out in very matter-of-fact manner. It seems almost slo-mo at times but it shows military expertise that has already been played out hundreds --if not, thousands-- of times in training& actual operations on the battle field. I don't remember ever seeing a climax staged in this way. It is a virtuoso effort by a director at the top of her game who is not afraid to change things up.This is a tough film to categorize. I think of it as a 'compeller' rather than a 'thriller', but I was caught up in it every single second.",10,0,6,13 January 2013
War of the Worlds," Spielberg at his peak (again)
","For sheer spectacle no filmmaker alive today (or ever)can touch Steven Spielberg (unless James Cameron ever decides to make another movie--say, Arthur C. Clarke's 'Childhood's End'?). This movie is unrelentingly grim, very horrifying, heartfelt and absolutely spectacular. Tom Cruise always rises to the level of his material and his work here makes you totally forget Katie Holmes and Scientology. Despite his riches he makes you believe that his character is a working class guy who is mostly decent, but can a jerk at times too. When he is confronted with the unspeakable horror of an alien invasion we see the fear, confusion and desperate need to take action in his eyes and in his face. Dakota Fanning is awesome too. (Is she real?) But make no mistake about it this is Steven's film. Their are veins of SCHINDLER'S LIST, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and 9/11 woven throughout David Koepp's and Josh Friedman's excellent adaptation of H.G. Well's classic novel. Strangely enough it hews pretty closely to that novel which makes me wonder if they consulted Wells who can't possibly still be alive. Spielberg shifts from the intimate moments to the grand spectacle so easily it is scary. The f/x make the Martians and their machines seem so real that you are not in the theater watching a movie you are on Eastern seaboard trying to survive their attacks. Spielberg did this with '...RYAN'. He does it again here. This movie beat me up. Finally, this is not a PG-13 movie. It is every bit the R-rating that 'SCHINDLER'S...' and '...RYAN' got.",10,3,11,2 July 2005
The Green Mile," Wow! Darabont and King have done it again.
","This is a very rich movie that takes its sweet time getting set up in its first half and then some gut wrenching and heart felt resolutions in its second half. HOWEVER the first hour and  a half is sweet and very intriguing --it is not a waste of time. Just like The Shawshank Redemption, writer-director Frank Darabont has taken a Stephen King story set primarily in a prison and made it into a faithful and thrilling movie full of heart and soul. The Green Mile is ranks closely behind American Beauty, The Sixth Sense and The Insider as my favorite movie of the year. At some point it gets ridiculous saying which one is better. All I know is that this strange wondrous tale of a very special death row inmate and the effects he has on everybody around him left me and my date stunned. It is brutal, profane, shocking, sweet, heart warming and, at the end, enigmatic. It throws you through a lot of emotions. Although I didn't read the book(s) I've read enough of King to know that his voice rang loudly in Darabont's adaptation. It is a great story. Darabont's treatment in both writing and directing must make the author ecstatic. Tom Hanks shines (once again) as the prison guard assigned to keep peace on Death Row. But when John Coffey becomes his charge he begins to wonder what inner peace is all about. Coffey is played by Michael Duncan in a performance that came as much from out of nowhere as Haley Joel Osment's act in the Sixth Sense. The rest of the cast is also excellent. The amusing meanderings of the first half prove to be essential to the revelations of the second half. It is a real stunner.",10,1,2,30 December 1999
Inception," Jedi Mind Trick
",In many respects what Christopher has accomplished with this film is nothing short of miraculous in terms of escapist entertainment.Among its stunning feats: 1) It creates a Moebius Strip/ M.C. Escher logic that is surprisingly easy to follow if you like that sort of thing. At one point the film cuts across 4 different levels of dreams & keeps everything pretty straight forward. (Editor Lee Smith should start preparing his award acceptance speeches now.) 2) It features the best hand-to-hand fight sequence ever. It recalls 'The Matrix' but blows anything in that movie away. 3) Nolan has always played with the concept of time (except with 'The Dark Knight') & the parlor trick that he brilliantly pulled off in 'Memento' looks like kids stuff compared to this film. 4) He has always been slighted as a director of action (unfairly) but here the action matches just about anything that Paul Greengrass has ever thrilled us with. The action explodes with crackling intensity. 5) Leonardo Dicaprio has never been better. He couldn't carry 'Shutter Island' or play the aging Howard Hughes in 'The Aviator. His work here makes you care about his plight because if it doesn't the movie doesn't work (despite all the pyrotechnics). And he surrounded by excellent work by an excellent cast. This facet is a trademark of a Nolan film.Some critics have said the movie left them emotionally cold. I had tears welling up in my eyes at least twice watching it. About the only rap I may have about it is that is not as weird as some people may want it to be. 'Inception' is not as 'out there' as '2001' or 'Brazil' (or 'Walkabout' or 'Koyaanisqatsi' or 'Bladerunner') despite its dream logic. Ultimately I don't think Nolan was out to create a tabula rasa piece of cinema. It's a thriller of very unusual kind.,10,3,7,24 July 2010
The Blind Side," Blind-sided by Quinton Aaron, bullish on Bullock
","Disclaimer: I often think that movie makers DO get the books right at least 50% of the time (& sometimes they actually improve upon them).This movie proved to be a really nice surprise.I love the book & 20/20 piece did a nice job on the story so I felt I had already seen the movie. (So why spend $10 on it?)The actor cast as Oher did not look intimidating enough (as he is initially portrayed in the book) to pull off the unlikely transition that is the key to this true story so I thought this would be Leigh Anne Touhy's story due to all the press about Sandra Bullock's performance in it.I was wrong. Oher is the main character & Quinton Aaron proved more than capable of portraying this complex young man as I remember him in Michael Lewis's excellent prose. BUT it is also the Touhys' family story as well & Bullock well deserves the Oscar nom she is likely to get. Unfortunately for her & the movie it may too down-home-value oriented for her to get the statue.The movie is schmaltzy, a bit corny & pushes some obvious emotional buttons (things I typically hate in a movie) but John Lee Hancock & his players never push too hard. The true story itself is incredible. The movie's makers know this & are smart enough not to over sell it --in fact they actually pull back from a scene on the football field that Lewis described in further detail when Oher finally decides enough is enough.If you liked REMEMBER THE TITANS (which pushed buttons much further & got away with it) then you'll love this movie. It is one of the best of the year, but be quiet & don't tell 'Hollywood' that.",9,1,2,7 January 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," A near perfect arc.
","It's taken me awhile to fully digest this beautiful & tension wrought epic of chaos descending & grace ascending.If Christopher Nolan hasn't topped himself with this 3rd Batman film he sure as heck has come close. Christian Bale's Wayne/Batman carries this film as much as he does the 1st of the trilogy with a haunting performance that damn well better get at least a nomination for Lead Actor.Anne Hathaway's Selina Kyle ('Catwoman' is never said here) is as much fun to watch as Michelle Pfieffer's iconic turn in the same role in 1992. She is a real kick to behold for Catwoman fans like me.Joseph Gordon-Levitt's idealistic cop Blake may be the biggest surprise here. His acting is not the surprise (this guy has already proved his chops) but the weight of his role is. I don't remember seeing Levitt with as much gravitas as he has here.Tom Hardy's Bane is truly terrifying. He delivers two of the most brutal beatings I've seen lately in film & certainly tops anything I've ever seen in this genre. Bane doesn't get under your skin like Ledger's Joker. Bane can be explained --he has a cause-- while The Joker defies explanation.Marion Cotillard is in the mystery role & is every bit as good as she was in 'Inception'.Sir Micheal Caine, Gary Oldman & Morgan Freeman are all in top form too.The movie drags a bit during the first half of the third act but then recovers with a heart-stopping &, finally, elegiac ending that moved me to tears. This maybe the most heartfelt film Nolan has ever made (although 'Inception' was pretty bloody moving). As gigantic as this movie is (Nolan has really improved as a director of action) it ends on a very wistful, beautiful & poetic note.The production values are off the scale. Try to catch this film in IMAX because it is astonishing.",10,4,11,8 August 2012
Iron Man," Who'd of thought that Ironman could be so nimble?
","First off, this is Robert Downey Jr.s show & he soars in the role. It is arguably the best performance by an actor in a 'comic book' movie next to Bale's in Batman Begins & it is 180 degrees different in tone.Gywneth Paltrow has never looked more beautiful on-screen & what could have been a thankless role crackles with life due to her skill as well as the writers & director.Hello Jon Favreau! Thank you for your touch. You obviously have great talent in front the cam (Jeff Bridges & Terrence Howard and the rest) & behind it. That said, it still takes someone to let the talent shine without it getting out of control. It looks, feels & sounds great. Not since Doug Liman directing the 1st Bourne movie has such an unlikely pairing of director & material worked so beautifully.The movie does drag a bit during it obligatory showdown, but by then it has developed too much thrust to really let you down much.When does the sequel come out?",9,3,6,6 May 2008
Blade Runner," A deep, deep film that was probably too far ahead of its time.
","This film fails on its most basic level as a suspense thriller and then succeeds brilliantly on every other level beneath it and this film has level beneath levels. Harrison Ford beautifully underplays his role as the cop chasing down his uber-prey the androids who are hellbent on changing the rules. Rutger Hauer's (sic) performance burns in your mind long after the final credits run. His villain (if you can call him a villain) is one of the most memorable in movie history. Obviously the medium is the message when you're discussing BladeRunner. The look, the sound and its style brands your cerebral cortex with memories you'll never forget. And for a film that has so much eye candy in it there is a surprising amount of dialogue and acting moments that also stand out. Einstein once said something to the effect that to be a genius is to be misunderstood and certainly this film upon its initial release was greatly misunderstood.",10,0,0,23 September 1998
Signs," Close encounters of a 3rd rate kind.
","After the great movie 'The 6th Sense' and an even better movie, 'Unbreakable', the next movie from 'the next Speilberg' (a line that Newsweek stole from me) was bound to be heavily anticipated and with 'Signs' M. Night Shyamalan stumbles. 'Signs' isn't a major misfire from this major talent, but it certainly misses its mark. This is the year's 2nd major dissappointment (Star Wars II ranking alongside of it). It is a beautifully mounted film with a great message that says that nothing is accidental. The shocks are 'Boo!' B-movie variety, the acting is constricted by the weight gloom and doom yhat pervades the movie and I wonder if the X-Files hadn't been canceled if the aliens would have been available to work on this movie. Until the very end it never involved me emotionally the way Night's previous 2 movies had. The acting is a major problem. I felt that Mel Gibson (an excellent actor and a very powerful one) and Joaquin Phoenix were straitjacketed by their director. Their was really no catharsis. The buildup was never delivered. If this movie was 'CE3K' we needed a mothership scene. If this movie was 'War Of The Worlds' we needed a major destruction set piece. In 'Unbreakable' Night pulled back from showing us a horrendous train crash, but he got a way with it because it almost began the movie. 'Signs' doesn't give the big set piece that we so desparately awaited. A lot of things that 'Unbreakable''s detractors said were wrong that movie are evident here. I also think that we needed to see Graham's wife's death in its entirety at the start of this movie rather than in flashbacks, because too late in this movie do you really feel his pain. A few months (or years) from now I think 'Signs' will be viewed like Speilberg's '1941' as not being a bad movie but also as being a not very good one either.",5,1,1,4 August 2002
The Deer Hunter," An almost too-powerful and wrenching drama.
","There are a handful of truly excellent movies that I only want to experience once and this is one of them. Michael Cimino's sweeping portrait of men drafted into war to commit atrocities against other men is harrowing. The survivors suffer more than the dead. I know a lot of knee-jerk liberals read a lot of jingoistic patriotism into Cimino's script especially when the movie ended with singing of the Star Spangled Banner (or another 'patriotic' song), but I saw it as a ironic, if not sardonic, touch. This film could have been set in any war. I didn't see it as being specifically about Vietnam and thus the hotly debated use of Russian Roulette throughout the movie was an extremely effective metaphor rather than an historical fact or fiction. (I could care less whether it actually was used as a torture technique or not --all I know is that is moved me to the depths of my soul.)I was moved to tears by it. And of course the acting was brilliant. DeNiro gives one of best performances ever (and that is saying a lot) and he is matched by an excellent supporting cast. But as powerful as DeNiro is who can ever forget Christopher Walken's shattering performance in his Oscar winning role? The effect that Man's capacity for inhumanity had on him and everybody else was as tough to to watch as anything in movie history. His death was real shocker (in a very bad sense) and I don't even like remembering it as I write this. The Deerhunter is easily one of the top 20 films I've ever seen and is probably a top 10 pick. Its Oscars were richly deserved.",10,0,0,2 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," An emotionally wracking ghost story.
","The word of mouth (WOM) on this movie has been huge and I finally got around to seeing it after 4 weeks and I'm glad I did. If you have not seen it yet DO NOT KNOW THE ENDING. I won't even hint at it here except to say it is one the best in movie history. This is easily one of the best 3 films of year (among The Matrix, EdTV and Thomas Crown). I had tears running down my cheeks about 4 different times throughout this film and all because I cared about the kid. Haley Joe Osment gives the best child performance I've ever seen (even topping those given in CE3K and ET and Sleepers) as a sweet and troubled child who sees ghost. He should be a lock for a nomination for best lead actor Oscar (but then again 'Shakespeare...' won a 'best film' Oscar last year). Bruce Willis is wonderful as a sympathetic shrink trying to treat the kid (anybody who saw 'Nobody's Fool' will not be surprised by his work here) and Toni Collette (who?) is just right as the kid's mom. Also Olivia Williams is very fine and very beautiful as Willis's wife. Writer-director M. Night Smyamalan trusts the intelligence of his audience by giving us a screenplay as heart-tugging as 'Titanic' or 'Field Of Dreams'. The scares here are creepy but not shocking. He's too smart for that and they work because we really care about the people in the movie. His direction is virtually perfect. James Newton Howard's score is his best since 'Grand Canyon' and just as memorable (I can't wait to buy it). I'd heard that it was an excellent movie, but I still wasn't prepared by how good it was. The thing that really sets it apart is that for a scary movie it is touches your heart and in that respect it reminds me of 'Ghost' (although this is much scarier) and 'Jacob's Ladder'.",10,0,0,5 September 1999
Looper," It was the best of Time & the worst of Time
","Imagine if James Ellroy, Raymond Chandler or James M.Cain had written a sci-fi movie then we'd have the 1st half of 'Looper'. Now imagine if Terence Malick had written & directed a sci-fi movie then we'd have the 2nd hour of 'Looper'.The first hour is sci-fi noir almost as visionary as 'Bladerunner'. It is sharp, nasty, thrilling, brutal & inventive. Rian Johnson does such a great job with cracking dialog, cracking visuals & sharp cuts that it almost kills me to say that when this movie goes out to pasture it just about 'buys the farm'.'The Departed' died when Nicholson's character croaked. This film almost dies when it goes into a field of bad dreams. Its pacing completely changes. A head rush becomes a marathon.The performances are well above par. Joseph Gordon-Levitt can carry a film as he proves here. (His work in 'The Dark Knight Rises' had surprising gravitas.) Bruce is Bruce. The make-up didn't distract me one bit due to the acting. To say that Jeff Daniels is under-appreciated has become a clich√©.I give this movie a 11/10 for the 1st hour & a 5/10 for its 2nd hour. The math loop adds to 16/20 = 8/10 (=4/5 for you math teachers).Mr. Johnson, can you keep the same editor for the entire movie next time?",8,1,8,4 October 2012
Heat," One of the top 10 most under-rated films ever.
","How this movie was ignored by the Oscars is totally beyond me, but then again so is 2001's best picture loss. This is a great crime epic. The big scenes and small scenes are crafted with equal care. It is just about as good as the first 2 Godfather's and just as haunting. Michael Mann wrote a cold, brutal and very moving story about two men who are predators and are lost in life because of their natures. We have Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro --two of the greatest actors of my generation (I'm 41) giving two of the greatest performances of their careers. Their legendary scene over a cup of coffee may ridiculous in real cops and robbers life but but, man (pun intended), it makes for unforgettable cinema. The action is as good as it gets (the bank robbery 'set piece' is one of the top 5 shootouts ever filmed) and never seems dramatically phony i.e. thrown in just for 'action's' sake. Like just about all great movies the supporting is wonderful. Every role is memorable. This is one of the few scripts I've ever bothered to buy. It is a long movie that is richer for its length. Earlier Mann wrote and directed a wonderful (and equally underappreciated) movie called 'Thief' with James Caan 15 years before this one and I can't help but to think that 'Heat' is the novel length version of 'Thief''s short story.",10,0,0,2 August 1999
300," '300'? More like $300million in box office domestically.
","This isn't The Godfather or Close Encounters or United 93, but it is what it is and that is (not that Bill Clinton would ever understand what 'is' is) one helluva kickass sandal, sword and splatter pic that is FUN to watch ON a BIG SCREEN.Whatever Hollywood rocket scientist decided to leave director Zack Snyder alone to make his and his marvelous crews' vision come to life GOT IT RIGHT! The only stupid thing about 300 is the rock soundtrack which is mostly lost amid all the mayhem (thank you for mostly burying it, sound editors, mixers, whatever!).The actors deliver all their lines with gusto. Gerard Butler is totally believable as King Leonidas/Leader of the Spartans (imagine if Oliver Stone had cast him as Alexander?) And the women and children characters make strong impressions as well.BUT let's face it I went to see this film for its LOOK. It looks fantastic and feels it too. (Last year's X-MEN 3 sent me out of the theatre with the same sort of good charged buzz although X3 is a better pic). The 'slow parts' are entertaining. GLADIATOR died when Russell Crowe wasn't on the screen. 300 doesn't die when Butler is off the screen which he isn't very often.The violence and gore is abundant but never gratuitous. It is so stylized and over-the-top that I never winced once from watching it. James Cameron and Paul Verhoeven and Tony Scott stage such bloodletting similarly. Snyder knows how to thrill without sickening.DEFINITELY NOT FOR KIDS. If you bring a child into 300 then you are a SICKO (go back and wallow in your Saw and Hostel and Hills Have Eyes gorno-crap and get sterilized -- please do the human race a favor)!I can't say that I loved this pic, but, WOW!, I like it lot and more than I liked THE DEPARTED.Hey Zack, will this mean they'll greenlight WATCHMEN? (Be a bit more careful with the screenplay because you got Chris Nolan's BATMAN to live up to.)",8,3,11,12 March 2007
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The richest, the darkest, the most romantic and the best of the 4.
","Every time I watch this movie in whatever format (big screen, video, letterbox or pan and scan) I am absolutely entranced by the feel of it. The opening snow battle (with those insanely elephantine Imperial Walkers) and the chase scene amidst the asteroids are as thrilling as any scenes in the 'quadrilogy'. But what especially draws me in is the heaviness that seems to imbue just about every frame and every line the actors speak. This is quite a (welcome) jolt from the whiz bang frivolity that wins over Episodes 1, 4 & 6. I don't know how much of this tonal change (if you will) was brought to the material by director Irvin Kershner or how much it had to do with the necessary downturn in the script that was pre-ordained to end in the Darth Vader's favor. Whatever or whoever was responsible added psychological muscle to an already hyperactive story. I also loved the deepening relationship between Princess Leia and Han Solo. Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford generate some real electricity, albeit confused and awkward (until the end, of course), in the middle of all the other excitement. In fact I think that one of the most romantic scenes in movie history comes when the Princess declares her love for Han just before he gets carbonized and he replies that he knows her feelings. What could have come off as terribly smart alecky and arrogant instead resonates with reciprocation and desparation the way Ford says his line. This romance is what really carries this movie for me. Finally John William's score is among his all-time best and with or without the movie absolutely soars.",10,0,0,6 March 2000
The Social Network," Bold Face(book) Type
","Like others before me when I initially heard about this project I wondered what could a director as talented as David Fincher see in a Facebook movie? (I thought this was just a project to keep him busy before his take on 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo'.)What Finch & writer Aaron Sorkin saw was an epic tale about human triumph & tragedy set in the digital age & pretty much encompassed in one man's soul. And now we see one of the very best films of the year. I rank it along with 'Se7en' & 'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button' as one of Fincher's best films.Jesse Eisenberg is spectacular as FB founder Mark Zuckerberg in the most complex performance of the year. He is an unsympathetic underdog & yet I found myself siding with him. He is not an anti-hero. I often root for anti-heroes. This guy is something different altogether. Know what? There is no small amount of Lisbeth Salander in him or his portrayal here.But other actors shine here too: Andrew Garfield & Justin Timberlake (yeah, that Timberlake) hit it out of the park as the burned partner & the Svangeli.Sorkin's script is a marvel of fast-paced dialog & is funny as hell. I never thought I'd be laughing as much as I did here. This is, by far, Fincher's funniest film.Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography carries on his father's legacy proudly. The score by Trent Reznor & co. is the most inventive since Hans Zimmer's & James Newton Howard's 'The Dark Knight'.",10,1,2,9 October 2010
Cinderella Man," Another knockout for Howard and Crowe
","As much as I love APOLLO 13 I have to say that this may be Ron Howard's best film yet. Cinderella MAN is that rare adult-aimed film that you can take your kids and grandmother to see (like APOLLO 13 for that matter). It is a warm and vibrant film that earns in heart-in-your-throat moments with some vivid depictions of The Great Depression and very exciting boxing scenes. I think Russell Crowe is the best actor working right now because he disappears into a role and becomes it like DeNiro did when he made films for art and not $$$. James Braddock's story is more compelling than Rocky Balboa's because his fairy tale was true. Crowe makes this uncomplicated good guy really interesting which is almost a miracle in itself. This a guy you honestly root for (forgive me Australia) and Crowe and Howard never telegraph their intentions. BUT they also have the talents of Paul Giamatti (better here than he ever has been) and Renee Zellweger in key supporting roles. And let's not forget Craig Bierko as Max Baer who makes a 'bad guy' 3-D. I don't really like boxing (that b-tch Tyson still owes me $35 for that Holyfield rip-off and I hope you read this you vicious thug quitter), but now Cinderella MAN comes on the heals of MILLION DOLLAR BABY (which the Oscars got right) within a year and you gotta wonder when Don Kings dies maybe the sport can revive itself like it has on screen. (At least the filmmakers are honest.)",10,0,0,26 June 2005
Up in the Air," Turbulent Skies.
","Thsi movie joins THE HURT LOCKER & AVATAR as 1 of the truly great films of the year.You gotta give writer/director Jason Reitman a lot of credit for keeping this emotional mess of a movie flying. It soars on the strength of the writing, direction & 3 excellent performances surrounded by a slew of really good ones.As much as I'd like to describe this movie I don't want to give anything away. It is as unpredictable as that 'A' movie is predictable. It could have gone wrong so many times but it doesn't.If it wasn't for MICHAEL CLAYTON this would be Clooney's best work in a career filling with outstanding efforts. He could've gotten away with slickness here & made it look easy. The pain in his eyes & forced smile are conveyed with all the discomfort of a suit that fits a bit too tight. Vera Farmiga is sexier than hell as his lover. Their chemistry matches the kind that Clooney had with J-Lo in OUT OF TIME (?). And Anna Kendrick is as much of a discovery as Jeremy Renner was from THE HURT LOCKER. She is an electric bundle of ambition, vulnerability & cuteness. All 3 are memorable.This film takes some unexpected turns & gets very murky in an emotional sense but they all add to the depth of what goes on in it. As much as I love THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, UP IN THE AIR represents a big step forward for Reitman. It is very dark stuff.",10,1,5,25 December 2009
