Captain Phillips," Nothing Personal Just Business.
","'Wolves are only what God made them,' said Bismarck of the Polish nationalists of his day, 'but we shoot them just the same.' That's pretty much the message of Captain Phillips. Starting with Phillips lamenting to his wife that the world is growing far more competitive, and that it's no longer enough just to meet the requirements of the job, the movie segues immediately to a harbor in Somalia, where warlords drive pirates to sea, idle and desperate men clamor and bribe to be recruited to a pirate crew, and issues of leadership and priorities are worked out by a good stout whack over the head with a monkey wrench. Both Phillips and Muse, the pirate captain, have crewmen who complain that this stuff is tougher than they thought it was going to be. Both have parallel problems – Hanks in figuring out how to placate and mislead the pirates while not getting killed, Muse in figuring out what to do as his plans go increasingly awry. Late in the movie, when Phillips suggests that Muse take the $30 thousand in the ship's safe, let him go, and cut his losses, the pirate replies 'I have bosses.' So does Phillips, whose bosses sent his unarmed ship ship through pirate infested waters in the first place. Everybody's got to make a living, and ransoming first world merchant ships and their crews to the insurance company for millions is a lot more lucrative than fishing, even if not much of the money trickles down to the guys in the boats who do the dirty work. The model has worked plenty of times before; Muse tells Phillips they got a $6 million ransom last week. He thinks there's no reason why it shouldn't work again. As he tells Phillips when he boards the Maersk Alabama, 'No al-Qaeda here. This is business.' But the United States doesn't do business – especially not a new half-African President elected on a peace platform who thinks he has to look tough for the American public and the rest of the world.The pirates remind me of the Penguin characters in the Madagascar movies. There are four Penguins: a captain who is forceful, always planning, and always optimistic, but nowhere near as smart or in control as he thinks; a steady, reliable guy who handles details; a hothead who wants to smash things up; and a wide-eyed rookie. So here. Muse has a steady helmsman-mechanic, a hothead increasingly eager to shoot somebody as the walls close in, and a wide-eyed rookie completely out of his depth. Like the Penguins, the pirates' dash and nerve get them into situations they can't handle, involving technology they don't understand. Muse's mantra as things spin increasingly out of control, is 'everything is going to be OK.' It's less to keep Phillips calm than to reassure himself.The driving force of the plot is shameless fraudulent concern. The unarmed Phillips tries to mislead, stall and distract the pirates not only by playing dumb but by offering them food and medical care for their wounded man. Once the Navy is on the scene, the officer in charge is told to string the hostages along with food, water and promises until the SEALs can be flown in to do the necessary shooting. If he can trick them into surrender, so much the better. If not, the SEAL commanding officer is happy to pose as the insurance company representative until his men can get the pirates in their sights. His lies are plausible because he knows the pirates' names, their home port, their clan, and their clan elders, information probably obtained through the usual channels by which ransoms were negotiated with the Somalis. We've been watching Lenny Briscoe and assorted hostage negotiators lie like this to suspects for years, so we'd know exactly what's coming even if this weren't a true story. Sometimes it doesn't work out. This time it does, even it leaves Phillips shocked and blood-soaked.Hanks does the fine job you'd expect of him, but it somehow falls short. You sympathize with the character's plight, but the man himself seems oddly unengaging. The rest of the Alabama's crew are barely sketched in, even though they played a key role in defeating the pirates' initial plan and forcing them off the ship. The Navy captain and the SEAL commander are just functions of their job. When he wants to, Greengrass can bring faces in the crowd to life with a few strokes, as he did with the passengers in United 93. I get the impression he wasn't really that interested in the American sailors. The Somalis – all played by Somali-Americans from Minneapolis – are a much more interesting lot. In particular, Barkhad Abdi, who plays Muse, comes close to stealing the picture from Hanks. He's as chewy a villain as Magua in Mann's Last of the Mohicans, as Madame Defarge, or, for that matter, as Satan in Paradise Lost. While the real Muse is doing 33 years in federal prison for piracy, it looks like Abdi might just have a future in Hollywood. Such is life.",7,1,7,14 October 2013
Mulan," An Ambivalent Message
","This is not quite the story of self realization and female empowerment that the commercial and internet reviewers are calling it. If she is a role model for the independent girl, Mulan is a very ambivalent one.Mulan does balk at being married off by the matchmaker, she does go off to war, and she does prove to be not only tough and brave but the smartest soldier in her outfit. She twice saves the life of Li Shang's, her commanding officer and love interest, and she kills the chief of the Huns. The Emperor, who says 'A girl like this doesn't come along every dynasty,' gratefully offers her a seat on the Imperial Council.Having seen the wider world at its ugliest in wartime, Mulan is uncomfortable with her newly won status. She turns down the offer because, she says, she has been away from her family too long. Prodded by the Emperor, the deeply smitten but none too swift Li Shang follows to court her. As the movie ends, it is perfectly clear that she will marry him, with the enthusiastic support of her mother and grandmother, who had despaired of ever marrying her off.Li Shang is brave, conscientious, honorable, from a good family, and not all that smart. You can see him 30 years later in his father the general, a dignified, worthy man who gets his army massacred by the Huns. He is still an excellent match for Mulan and her family, and she is an excellent match for him. He'll love and honor her in very comfortable surroundings as he pursues a career at court. She'll run the marriage and bring some brains and spirit into the Li gene pool. Their sons should do very well. Their daughters are another story. The Emperor sees Mulan as something that 'doesn't come along every dynasty,' not as an example of half the population of his realm. And Mulan turns down that seat on the Imperial Council. Her family comes first, and she's been successful enough already. She turns her back on her own exceptional quality. Mulan doesn't put on a glass slipper, but she makes her own glass ceiling. If the movie has a message for girls, it is that the wider world of men is a nasty, hard and dangerous place. Having a successful career there when you're young is good because it wins you respect and puts you in touch with a much better class of husband material when the time comes to leave your career behind, go home, and settle down with your own family. Mulan's courage, spirit and intelligence raise her out of the marriage market to which she appears foredoomed in the first reel, only to win her the one extraordinary man whom she deserves in the last.Mulan is popular entertainment shrewdly and successfully designed to appeal to an audience that favors gender equality in principle but is ambivalent about its price. While we'd like our daughters to do well in their own right, we'd also like them to mother our grandchildren. Mulan is all in favor of young women of intelligence and spirit going out to prove themselves in the world run by men, but it is equally in favor of their settling down with the right young man to carry on the family after they have gotten the career thing out of their system.",5,3,6,8 August 2014
The Hunger Games," Not Hungry Enough
","A safe, workmanlike adaptation of a much stronger book. The book was told in Katnis's interior monologue. The film had to be opened up so that it could be shown, using Ceasar and Seneca as expositors. (Seneca's death was cleverly done.) But, as many have pointed out, the story was heavily sanitized to get a PG-13 rating. Since author and co-writer Collins is an experienced screenwriter for tween TV, I assume she knew the choices she was making. Here's a partial list:Haymitch drinks a bit much but is not introduced as an apparently non-functioning alcoholic.No avoxes.As to violence, the initial melee at the Cornucopia was OK -- Katniss's own impressions were fragmentary as she grabbed the backpack and ran. Glimmer's screaming death from tracker jacker stings was ghastly enough. But Rue's death was seriously blanded down. In the book Katniss has to watch her be speared, she shoots the D1 boy in the throat, and she watches him drown in his own blood with angry satisfaction. Not in the movie -- it's quick cuts and clean wounds, and an Old Hollywood death scene. As the emotional high point of the story, it called for Private Ryan.We don't see Katniss overcoming her disgust to clean the pus out of Peeta's wound, and Peeta doesn't lose his leg.Biggest problem is no hunger. It's not just that Lawrence looked nothing like a 16 year old who's been underfed her whole life. It's that in the book food and hunger are central to Katniss's view of the world. She constantly thinks about both. At home she's glad to get a bowl of wild dog soup when she can. Bread is her first connection to Peeta. What impresses her about the Capitol is the endless supply of exquisite things to eat. She comprehends its wealth by figuring out how much time and effort it would take her to duplicate one dish. In her interview, saying that she's most impressed by the lamb stew projects her as a real country girl from the boondocks. In the arena she starts out half dead and delirious from thirst, spends most of her time hunting, and is always aware of exactly how much food she has on hand. She bonds with Rue over their shared experience of hunger back home -- Rue gets to eat a whole groosling leg for the only time in her short life. D11 thanks her for Rue's funeral with bread. None of that makes it through the adaptation. It could have, with a little more time at the Hob, some different dialog, and with gaze and reaction shots. Without the hunger, it's a much more routine adventure story than it should have been.",6,0,1,22 September 2012
The English Patient," Pretty But Politically Distatsteful
","This is just Catch-22 with romance and gorgeous scenery. Like Yossarian, Almasy sees the great sacred cow of World War Two as simply an intrusion on his individual happiness and a threat to his personal well being.When Caravaggio tells Almasy that thousands of people had died because he helped the Germans, Almasy replies 'thousands of other people would have died if I hadn't.' Whether the deaths were Allied or Axis is morally neutral to him, compared to his need to recover the body of his dead lover. We are meant to sympathize with his romantic loyalty and political indifference.Almasy is presented as an exile without country or politics, whose only homeland is his pocket Herodotus. (The historical Almasy was actually a Hungarian officer serving in the Luftwaffe and assigned to Rommel's headquarters, but that's just dramatic license.) Katherine is an instinctive Little Englander who longs to leave Egypt for a garden in Dorsetshire; she loves neither her husband nor the imperial project in which he is deeply involved. The romance between Hana and Kip is equally anti-political. She is a French Canadian, he a Sikh, both members of subject peoples serving a British Empire in which they have no stake, and they drop out of the war to make a private space for themselves.English Patient is the anti-Casablanca. It's perspective is that the problems of two little people are the only thing that amounts to a hill of beans in this crazy world, and that the intrusions of history, politics and war are simply a curse. E.M. Forester wrote that if he had to choose between betraying his friend and betraying his country, he hoped he'd have the guts to betray his country. The movie says 'Amen.'",5,2,5,7 August 2006
The Notebook," Exactly What It Purports To Be
","One of the contemporary reviews of this movie called it first class romantic schlock, which is a compliment because that's exactly what Nicholas Sparks and Nick Cassavetes set out to do. McAdams and Gosling at the outset of their career as leads have excellent chemistry as the young lovers, and Garner and Rowlands are a couple of solid old pros in the framing story. The high point is what Cher, in Clueless, would have called a 'major boinkfest' as desire long deferred is finally consummated, followed up a major confession that transforms your view of the villain of the piece. The ending is strictly by the numbers.",5,2,3,18 October 2019
Juno," Modern Capra
","I'm surprised at the vehemence of the people who dislike this movie for not making a Serious Statement about teenage pregnancy and/or abortion. Underneath the hipper than thou dialog, Juno is basically the kind of sentimental fable about decent, likable people that Frank Capra would be making if he were in his prime today. It has about as much to do with the actual consequences of pregnancy for a working class teenager as You Can't Take It With You did with unemployment during the Depression, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington with the rules of the Senate, or It's A Wonderful Life with the savings and loan business in a small town. That's pretty good company, and Juno belongs there.",7,1,10,23 January 2008
"I, Tonya"," Contemporary
","This is a perfect movie for the Age of Trump in three respects. First, as Harding says at the end of the movie, 'There is no such thing as truth; everybody has their own truth.' Second, it is the self-pitying tale of a talented prole who found the system rigged against her. Third, the central character turns her feelings of undeserved inferiority into energizing rage before she is undone by moronic underlings. Robbie's Harding is a blue collar Nixon.Superior acting; Robbie proves that she is far more than this year's blonde, and Janney does a great embittered working class authoritarian. The supporting cast of idiots from the husband on down is maybe written and played a little overbroad, but then people that dumb are walking around out there. The shot in which a man carrying a metal club nevertheless uses his head to smash a locked glass door says it all.The script claims to be based on interviews with Harding, her mother and her ex-husband. Missing from the list is her self-appointed 'bodyguard,' Shawn Eckerdt, which is why all the blame for The Incident winds up on him and his minions.",7,0,1,23 January 2018
The Book Thief," Dreadfully Saccharine
","The creators of The Book Thief have somehow managed to make a movie about World War II in which many people are killed but no one ever seems to be hurt or to suffer pain. The two leads do not age convincingly from 12 in 1938 to almost 17 in early 1943. The device of having Death do the voice-over narration trivializes what the characters are supposed to be going through; Death's slightly bored perspective is that everybody dies sooner or later, so that 15 or 85 doesn't matter in the long run. The most that can be said is that the production design is attractive and all the kids look adorable in their HJ and BDM uniforms.",3,17,38,27 November 2013
The Devil Wears Prada," Chanel Boot Camp
","This is a boot camp movie, like An Officer and A Gentleman, with Meryl Streep in the Lou Gosset, Jr. role. Trainee Anne Hathaway is given seemingly impossible assignments by this heartless, demanding mentor who is curious to see if the kid is smart enough and tough enough to learn the job and do it. Hathaway succeeds because she is smarter, tougher and more competitive than she likes to think she is. (After all, the kid didn't get to be editor in chief of her undergraduate paper simply on girlish charm and good looks). What pulls her in to Streep's world isn't really the clothes and the glamour. It's the pride in meeting impossible standards and showing the old bitch that she can take it all, get it done, and come back for more. Her reward is to know that she really is as good as the demands of the job require -- and those demands include believing in the job, not just doing it. In other words, Streep runs the same con on Hathaway that drill sergeants and law professors have been running for years, and she almost pulls it off.The movie breaks down at the end because drill sergeant Streep doesn't pull it off, and her failure doesn't ring true. Hathaway's character couldn't be both as competitive as she is and as girly-naive as she is about the consequences of competition at the highest level, where there are a lot more butts than there are chairs to sit them in. It's as if Richard Gere, after winning Gosset's approval, had said, 'Wait a minute. You mean I'll have to drop bombs on people when I'm a Navy pilot? I quit.' Until then, though, DWP provides the pleasure of watching the old story of a rookie mastering a difficult, challenging craft and learning along the way that she has a lot more resources than she thought she had.",7,3,6,5 July 2006
Rush," Everything It Should Be
","After a short framing section, this starts off with a bloody-mouthed Chris Hemsworth in half-undone racing coveralls strutting into an emergency room on a wave of testosterone like a cock into a hen house. Every female head in the place turns, and a glaze of lust falls across nurse Natalie Dormer's face. Within a minute and 4 lines of dialogue, he and she are doing the horizontal mambo on the examining table and, through a series of quick cuts, plenty of other places. In short, it looks like we're going to get a 16 year old boy's dream of being a race car driver.It turns out to be a great deal more. Director Howard and writer Morgan turn out to have a lot more empathy with the precise, earnest, űber-professional Austrian Niki Lauda (known as the Rat or the Sour Kraut) than they do with long haired, gorgeous English party animal James Hunt – there's a montage after Hunt wins the 1976 Formula 1 driving championship that subtly trivializes and belittles what he does with his victory, and a concluding tête á tête between Hunt and Lauda that makes it explicit. This isn't surprising considering the way the critics have treated Howard's body of work over the years. But along the way we're treated to a struggle between Cavalier and Roundhead, JFK and Nixon, inspiration and perspiration that is never less than captivating. The personal distaste between the two men, the contrast of styles, and the way they get into each other's heads are too intense for the subject of their rivalry, which after all is only motor racing. You feel that they were born 30 years too late, and that they should have been up in the sky a generation earlier, trying to kill each other in Spitfires and Messerschmitts instead of zipping around in McLarens and Ferraris. The gorgeous women (Dormer, Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara) are more or less along for the ride as arm candy, although Hunt gets to display some dry, malicious English wit after his supermodel wife (Wilde) dumps him for Richard Burton. The racing sequences pull you in, and the overwhelming sound design gives you a real feel for the power (and fascination) of the internal combustion engine. The climactic race is subtly different than you'd expect from a sports movie but absolutely true to the characters.This is not great art, but it is thrilling popcorn entertainment the way it's supposed to be done, and it is to racing movies like Das Boot is to submarine movies. They'll never have to make another one.",7,12,16,1 October 2013
Nightcrawler," An American Success Story
","One morning Gregor Samsa woke up to find that he had been transformed into a giant cockroach. With his crazy eyes, skeletal features, scuttling movements, and natural affinity for the night, Lou Bloom has always been a giant cockroach – trying to pass for human by living according to the self-improvement and HR-speak clichés he's learned off the internet. He joins the pantheon of American movie crazies with Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin, but his crazy is different than theirs. Lou doesn't dream of violent catharsis or celebrity. He dreams of good, old fashioned American entrepreneurial success by finding an unmet need and doing whatever it takes to fill it. The better parallel is with Fincher's fictional version of Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network.Lou is a genius at what he does, much less sophisticated than Zuckerberg but just as single minded and brilliant at his bottom feeding place on the food chain. He is uneducated, or rather self- educated, but he has plenty of native intelligence and a sharp analytical mind to go with his energy and determination. Having learned that the customer wants not reality but a certain image of reality, he sets out to provide that image by any means that come to hand. Because he's intelligent and analytical, he knows how to adjust reality to what the customer wants. Because he's inhumanly focused on the task at hand, he has no compunction about making the adjustments. And he's as talented a businessman as he is a technician. The high point of the movie is the scene where he shows the customer, an aged-out news chick who has become the night shift news director on the lowest rated station in LA, exactly how well he understands the market, his place in it, and hers too. Lou is a very fast learner indeed.Nightcrawler's third act goes a bit too far over the top. Let's just say that someone in Lou's business needs the good will, or at least the acquiescence of the police in the long run, and he does something that should get him on the LAPD's permanent blacklist. At the very least, it seems to me, the cops would have gotten a warrant to search his hard drive, but he just walks with impunity. That's not credible. Everything else is far too credible",7,0,2,4 November 2014
American Beauty," A Useless Life
","It's a sign of how good an actor Kevin Spacey is that he makes Lester Burch so appealing, because Burch is a contemptible man who deserves all the unhappiness he has. When we meet him, he shows no interest in anything or anyone outside himself. That's his misfortune, because he has no inner resources. He has no ideas and no thoughts, only feelings of loss and unfocused resentment. There is not a book in his house. He has no apparent religion and no apparent politics. He doesn't even have a hobby to give some artificial structure and meaning to his life.His present condition is the natural consequence of the youth he remembers with nostalgic longing. Lester Burch is 42 in the fall of 1998, when American Beauty begins. He is the exact contemporary of Kevin Arnold and the kids in the basement on That 70s Show. He would have graduated from high school the year Nixon resigned and from college at the bottom of the Sour Seventies. He remembers a few political catch phrases about fascism from his childhood, but he mourns the passing of no youthful ideals and no youthful ambitions. Burch describes himself as a frat boy who drank and screwed his way through college. The youthful joy whose loss he now laments is no more than the joy of a constant frat party -- life as a beer commercial. Once marriage and fatherhood ended the party, Burch drifted into his dead end job and sterile family life because he had never prepared himself for anything better. When his balls galvanize his brain into life, Burch can conceive no better rebellion than regressing to the frat boy he remembers having been. He abandons any obligation to support his wife and daughter. He gets a minimum wage, minimum effort job. He listens to the bad rock and roll of his youth. He buys the car he always wanted as a teenager. He spends the rest of his money on weed and toys. He spends the rest of his time on restoring his body to what it should have been at age 19, so that a 16 year old hottie will want to have sex with him. He takes as his model the teen-aged marijuana dealer next door, who can be fearless because he has no responsibilities to anyone but himself. He deserts his family as completely as he can without moving out of the house where he lives, rent free, on what his wife earns selling other houses.Lester Burch, in short, is a man who never grew up and who feels that the world owes him a party. He is useless to himself and others, and there is no particular reason for him to continue to take up air that somebody better could breathe. He only has one moment of redemption -- when he finally sees the 16 year old object of his fantasies as a confused, frightened, vulnerable human being instead of a sex toy, he has enough residual decency to treat her decently. That isn't enough. Burch cannot go back to 19. His daughter is about to run away and his wife to throw him out. He has boxed himself into a dead end, from which his fortuitous, though foreshadowed, murder is a convenient exit. While his death may be messy, it will be no loss to anyone once his brains are wiped off the kitchen tile.",6,2,4,6 May 2014
The White Ribbon," Those To Whom Evil Is Done
","Michael Haneke doesn't believe in solving mysteries for his audience. Apparently he does believe in the left wing Freudian analysis of Wilhelmine Germany. Between the wars, German thinkers like Reich, Marcuse, Bettelheim and Adorno all concluded that the culture of sexual repression and patriarchy had been the root cause of the First World War -- not simply the outbreak, but the dogged obedience and endurance the German people had displayed during four years of hardship, hunger and slaughter. A fortiori the same root causes applied to the German desire, epitomized by Nazism, to do the whole thing over and get it right this time. The Weimar fusion of Freudian psychiatry and Marxist politics is with us to this day. It was vulgarized during the 1960s to a slogan -- Make Love, Not War -- that assumed that fighting and sex were antitheses. It is still the conventional wisdom of middle class progressives about gender relations and child rearing.The conventional view of European life just before the catastrophe of the First World War is one of hazy nostalgia for a lost world of order and certainty. Haneke isn't having any. His little village of Eichwald, somewhere on the North German plain, is a pastoral hell of patriarchy, subordination, violent punishment, heartless religion and sexual repression, breeding envy, resentment, hatred, and self-loathing, where children's natural impulses are driven underground by force to emerge in violent cruelty towards the helpless. The social structure of Eichwald is dominated by the Baron, who owns most of the land and who most of the peasants depend on for wage labor on the estate. Representing order, learning and moral instruction are the Steward, who is a porcine and subservient brute, the Doctor, who is a self loathing sadist and pervert, and the Pastor, who coldly dispenses humiliating punishment in full 'this will hurt me more than it hurts you' mode. At the bottom of the educated elite, just above those who work with their hands, is our narrator, the ineffectual Teacher, who doubles as parish clerk and organist, and who is paid too little to afford to marry. All of these men are addressed as Sir -- Herr Baron, Herr Verwalter, Herr Artzt, Herr Pastor, and (by the children only) Herr Lehrer. The children address their fathers not merely as Father -- no Daddy here -- but as Father, Sir -- Herr Vater. The younger children are sweet and open, but by the time they're 10 to 12 the kids are hard, tight and closed. And onward to 1933-45.",8,1,3,6 March 2013
Dunkirk," A Technically Interesting Failure
","Saw it this weekend and thought it clever and well done but ultimately uninvolving despite the high level of tension it keeps up. I think it was overpraised by critics who admire Nolan as a technician, and I'd give it no more than a 6/10. It was interesting to see how Nolan converged the three time lines on a single point, but the dynamic in each timeline was very different. The one hour RAF timeline with Tom Hardy was pure action. Hardy's character makes two moral decisions, one quite unexpected, but you have to pay close attention to see them. Since I get chills whenever I see footage of a Spitfire, which Mark Rylance's character rightly calls the most beautiful airplane ever built, I was fully involved, but this action sequence didn't have the weight to carry one third of the movie. See Messerschmitt, dodge Messerschmitt, shoot Messerschmitt, da capo al fine.The most conventional segment, with the most character realization, was the one day timeline with Mark Rylance as a civilian pleasure boat owner displaying middle class stiff upper lip. His reasons aren't fully disclosed until the end, and there's a coda that, in the light of hindsight, gives you the difference between what happened and how it was reported and passed into memory. More I can't disclose without a spoiler.The one week timeline involving the troops on the beach is a failure. There simply wasn't enough social interaction among the men for the audience to relate to them as individuals or to their experience. Inarticulate fear will only take you so far, and that's all Nolan had to offer with the squaddies. It would have been more effective if 'Tommy,' whose name we never hear, were part of a small unit instead of a lone straggler-fugitive trying to attach himself to others. Then there might have been some grumbling, some mordant humor, some defeatism, or some other character developing conversation among people who already knew and trusted one another. Not here. Kenneth Branagh's character was a very heavy-handed Basil Exposition and nothing more. Nolan uses him to give a data dump and then ignores him till the next data dump is needed to orient the audience.Apparently Nolan finds the prospect of drowning while trapped under water to be particularly horrifying. He returns to that situation several times, in different settings and from different viewpoints. This contrasts with the complete absence of realistic wounds from the bombing; in that respect, the picture is as sanitized as a 1950s war movie. There are a few good throwaway lines. One that sticks in the mind is that as Tommy makes his way through a French barricade towards the beach, one of the French soldiers mordantly wishes him bon voyage.",6,12,19,24 July 2017
No Country for Old Men," Fatalism and Quietism
","The Coens have withheld the dramatic resolution that the setup promises: There is no final confrontation between Moss and Chigurh or Bell and Chigurh. Somebody else kills Moss, Chigurh evades Bell, and it isn't even completely clear, though it is hinted, whether Chigurh recovers the money. Instead, Chigurh kills an innocent because his peculiar idea of integrity requires him to, and he is himself almost undone by a random act of fate, while Bell decides that the world has simply gotten too hard for him to deal with any more. That may be how things work out in real life, but drama is supposed to impose a structure that real life lacks. The Coens willfully refuse. (Since I haven't read the novel, I don't know how much it dictates that decision. Even if it does, the Coens decided to use that novel as the material for the movie, rather than something else.)You can write anything you want on the resulting blank slate. What I put there is a terrified but emotionally distant fatalism. As Chigurh sometimes tells his victims, everything they have ever been and done has led them to the point where he kills them, without foresight or avoidance being possible. Fate, or History, or God, or the Universe, or whatever you want to call it is at best unrelenting and indifferent to our individual concerns. Worse, it may even be cruelly amused at our illusion that we know what is going on and can control events.Our age is pervaded by apocalyptic thinking. The fundamentalists are all dreaming of the End Times and the Rapture. The secular leftists are half fearful, half ecstatic over the same thing with the God part left out, either through the fatal crisis of capitalism, or through environmental catastrophe as our material civilization inflicts incurable damage on the planet, or by good old nuclear holocaust driven by events in the Middle East. Crossing all party lines is the fascination with the killer asteroid. What I think the Coens are saying is that the End is coming in one form or another, that there's nothing we can do about it, and that our individual wants and needs will be worthless and meaningless when it gets here. The only thing to do in the meantime is to live quietly, abandon the illusion of control, and cultivate our own garden for as long as we're allowed. That's a profoundly anti-American conclusion, dismissing all of our native optimism, and the culture optimism built, as a childish illusion.Bell decides to live that way. Carla Jean Moss faces death that way. She's perfectly right, of course, that the coin toss has only such meaning as Chigurh chooses to give it, and she refuses to pretend that her will has any influence on what he will do. I suppose that once you realize you're in the gas chamber at Auschwitz, all that's left you is the dignity of taking a deep breath instead of trying to claw down the bolted door.",7,2,5,3 December 2007
To Rome With Love," Spotty But Worth It
","Of the four disconnected story lines of 2RWL, the plot with the newlywed couple, the hooker and the movie star was completely dispensable, the plot with the shower singer was recycled early Allen shtick that could have been a sketch from Without Feathers 45 years ago, but the plot with Benigni's schmuck becoming a celebrity was enjoyable (and I never thought I'd want to see Benigni in anything ever again). The film is worth seeing for the plot with Baldwin, Eisenberg and Page -- a good, cynical, mildly malicious meditation on the truth that the only real male erogenous zone is the ego. Page has the guts to play a thoroughly dislikable character with real zest, and Baldwin glides gracefully as the voice of rueful experience. Like an icon that shows a saint simultaneously at several stages of being, Baldwin is at once Eisenberg's real older contemporary, the inner voice of his better judgment, the omniscient narrator and the older, successful Eisenberg looking back on the young idiot he was.Allen loves the theme of getting away with something -- murder in Crimes and Misdemeanors, Bullets over Broadway and Match Point, infidelity in Hanna and Her Sisters and Vicky Cristina. 2RWL has not one but three never detected infidelities, not to mention Benigni's more or less open dalliances that his bemused wife simply accepts as the perks of his bizarre celebrity.",6,1,3,25 September 2013
The Favourite," Good Nasty Historical Fun
","Maybe it's because I'm familiar with the history of the period, but I didn't find it as hard to follow the story as some of the mainstream critics. Churchill epitomized it thus: Godolphin managed the Parliament, Sarah managed the Queen, and Marlborough managed the war. That is, until they didn't because the bulk of the landowing class decided that England had been victorious enough that they didn't have to go on paying land tax. At that point, the Tories won the 1710 election, Sarah fell out of favor, and England abandoned its allies and negotiated peace with France. Abigail Masham, who took Sarah's place in Anne's affection, indeed had backdoor connections with Harley, the leader of the Tories.But the war and the politics are just the McGuffin for this movie. The core story is the shifting emotional relationship among the three women, which I found quite involving and fairly well grounded in history as such movies go. (It's certainly far better grounded than the egregious Mary Queen of Scots.) Anne was gouty and not too bright, and she did lose 17 children. (Her husband, Prince George of Denmark, was written out of the story as a distraction from the central triangle.) Sarah was Anne's BFF from the time they were teens, and she was the dominant one in the relationship until Anne kicked her to the curb. Anne did write Sarah some pretty steamy letters, which Sarah included in her published memoirs after Anne's death. Sarah and her husband Marlborough did embezzle public funds. Abigail Masham was accused at the time, albeit by writers in Sarah's pay, of having a lesbian relationship with Anne. The aristocratic bad behavior in this variant on All About Eve was great fun, and the performances deserve all the critical praise they've gotten.",7,2,2,25 February 2019
Gone Girl," Sardonic Black Comedy
","This is definitely value for the money. It's a black comedy of American manners, and the ending gets increasingly funny as it gets increasingly ghastly. Evelyn Waugh would have loved it. So, perhaps, would Jane Austen (who gets a shout out that is also an allusion to one of Pike's early roles), who had a sharp eye and sharper tongue for bad behavior.Of the two protagonists, Nick Dunne is all surface. What you see is what you get – a guy who tried to make a career in New York, failed, and is settling himself back into his old home town' where his shiny New York wife doesn't fit his new life, and auditioning a replacement who might. Human, but perfectly familiar.Amy Elliott Dunne is much more complicated and interesting, not simply the psycho bitch that some critics have made her out to be. The key to Amy is her parents. From their brief appearances, we can see that Amy's mother was definitely the dominant one in that marriage. She's a classic frustrated stage mother, or in modern terms a thwarted tiger mom, who – in the manner of upper middle class parents – desperately wants her child to be exceptional. Frustrated by her real daughter, she had poured her perfectionism into a fictional counterpart, Amazing Amy. It turns out that Nick Dunne is not the only character with a twin sibling. Amy Elliott is Amazing Amy's mediocre twin sister, and she has spent her whole life failing to measure up to that image of perfection. She dropped out of childhood pursuits and, we learn, misbehaved in prep school. To be sure, she got into Harvard. But, as the saying goes, everybody at Harvard got into Harvard. Real Amy didn't distinguish herself there, and she wound up in a glib and trivial New York job for superficially bright liberal arts graduates, writing personality quizzes for checkout counter magazines. She is still unmarried when her parents are about to give her perfect twin the perfect wedding.At first, it looks like she has finally matched, if not surpassed, her fictional sister by marrying Nick. When she tells him, 'We're so cute, I could punch us in the face,' she is saying that he and she look like the ideal young bourgeois bohemian married couple in what they don't know is pre-Crash Brooklyn. When they both lose their media jobs and Nick takes them to small town Missouri, Amy is enraged to find that without the trust fund Amazing Amy gave her, she is, in fact, perfectly ordinary and, though intelligent, not at all exceptional. Her plot against Nick isn't just the culmination of her rage at her downward mobility. It is her last chance to excel the Amazing Amy by pulling off a perfectly executed scheme, and she throws herself into it completely. But she fails once again, when she runs up against the kind of people she has never known, didn't plan for and has no idea how to deal with. In desperation she improvises one last, horrifying attempt at salvage. She pulls it off because of her total devotion to creating the necessary appearances and, most importantly, because of the credulous sentimental idiocy of her audience. At the end, we're looking at the opening chapter of Amazing Amy Becomes The Perfect Mom. God help the child.",7,1,9,13 October 2014
Unknown," Dull and Disappointing
","MAJOR SPOILERA good 'why is this happening to me' thriller, like North By Northwest or Frantic, is Kafka with a happy ending. A hero the audience can identify with gets caught up by mistake in a conspiracy he can't understand, but he ultimately figures it out, overcomes it, and gets his life back (along with the girl). Unknown doesn't work because the the normal life 'Martin Fletcher' has been struggling to get back to is an illusion. He's not a guy like us or an innocent victim. He's killer scum, just one of the villains suffering from traumatic amnesia, who has become a loose end the conspiracy has to tidy up. The 'wife' he thinks he loves is just one of the conspirators. Once we find that out, who cares about the McGuffin? Fletcher's efforts in the last third of the film to thwart the conspiracy are partly just petulance at his employer and partly the lingering effect of his delusion.And there's a fundamental problem with the conspirators' diabolical plan to kill a scientist while making it look like collateral damage from the assassination of someone else. Prominent scientists in the same field may not know each other personally, but they know each other's work and reputation. 'Martin Fletcher' couldn't just suddenly appear a year ago as the kind of professional colleague that the target victim would know and deal with.Neeson does the best he can with this material. January Jones is a block of wood, and I suspect that much of her performance wound up in the trim barrel because she couldn't carry off her character's more forceful aspects. There are many egregious lapses in logic and continuity, starting with the fact that the US Embassy would have a duty officer available over the Thanksgiving weekend and ending with the seamless insertion of Diane Kruger's picture into Jones's fake Canadian passport at the end. The only redeeming feature is Bruno Ganz, and his scene with Langella is a bizarre bit of nostalgia for the supposed chivalry of Cold War spies.Not even worth Netflix.",2,11,22,21 February 2011
Call Me by Your Name," Meh
","I could not get involved. The setting of well off people summering in the beautiful Italian countryside has become a tired cliche. Armie Hammer's Oliver is the most bleached out Aryan looking Jew imaginable; he looks like the epitome of every Ralph Lauren ad ever made. Timothy Chalament is a convincing Elio, but his search to find his sexual identity in this setting is truly a First World Problem. Most importantly, there simply isn't enough conflict to make the story interesting. Everyone is simply too nice and too reasonable; Michael Stuhlberg's climactic speech of reassurance not only goes on too long but sounds like it came from a textbook; it is Polonius for our time. The effort to create some tension in a young gay man's coming of age by setting the problem 35 years ago in the early 80s is ineffective, in large part because nobody seems to be aware that AIDS exists. It's well made, well performed and beautiful to look at, but it falls flat.",5,4,14,28 January 2018
The Illusionist," Hapsburg High School
","Very enjoyable for what it set out to be; well played, beautifully shot, and with a plot that hustles you over the soft spots and makes it easy to suspend disbelief. It could have been so much better with a few minor tweaks.Chief Inspector Uhl is the one thoroughly adult character, a man who thinks he is worldly wise because he has managed to get the most he can out of the system. Thanks to historical hindsight, we know he's not as shrewd as he thinks because he doesn't realize the system is doomed. All the other characters are from a teenage romantic comedy, even though they're in their late 20s or early 30s. Eisenheim/Abromowitz projects the burning resentment of a smart, talented guy who is told he'll never get what he deserves, including the girl of his dreams, because he isn't one of the right people. Duchess/Cheerleader Sophie is something of a blank slate; we don't have enough back story to understand what would make an aristocrat like her break out of her upbringing by even seeing the son of a (Jewish) cabinetmaker as an interesting human being. We just have to accept the nerd's fantasy that she'd be dazzled by his sheer talent and fall in love with him. Crown Prince Leopold is simply a stock character, the villainous macho jerk from a hundred teenage romantic comedies. In this triangle, class and sex appear to have the same relations in the Austro-Hungarian Empire as they do at John Hughes High, and The Illusionist is enjoyable as an elegant retelling of that old familiar plot.---SPOILERS BELOW ---It would have been a stronger movie if Leopold had been a less one-sided character. Take away the spiteful nastiness and make the Prince an intelligent, ambitious, aggressive man who can see that the empire he has inherited is collapsing and is desperate to make the thing work. Keep both Eisenheim's hatred of a society that has unjustly denied him his heart's desire and his need to destroy the man who symbolizes that society in order to get the happiness he deserves. Leave everything else in place. Instead of a mere happy ending, you get deeper overtones of tragedy.It would also have been a stronger movie if the last scene had been left on the cutting room floor. Let Uhl figure out the illusion, only too late, but leave the audience guessing whether he was right or not.Finally, there was one major logical flaw in the illusion of Sophie's death. She belongs to a prominent, powerful family who are Leopold's political allies. Even if she had the cooperation of the family doctor to bluff Uhl and the police out of examining her apparent corpse (and we don't know how she and Eisenheim got his help), how were her relatives tricked? In particular, what did the lover/conspirators do about the very public funeral the Duchess von Teschen would have received?",7,0,0,2 October 2006
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Kid's Do The Darndest Things
","The best way to look at this movie about an 8 year old German boy coming into contact with the fringes of the Holocaust is as an episode of Leave It To Beaver in which the Beaver gets himself into a scrape by applying a child's logic to incomplete and misunderstood information about the adult world. The first half works as a very credible child's eye view of a family in which Naziism is right, normal and taken for granted, although Grandma and Mom do have a few qualms about what Dad does at the office. The second half fails because the child prisoner whom Bruno -- the Beaver -- befriends could not have the same child's innocence that Bruno has. Bruno has no reason to understand what is going on behind the wire, but an 8 year old in the camp would know all too well. You can see the melodramatic ending coming a mile away.",5,4,10,8 February 2009
The Imitation Game," Disappointing Dull and Static
","Alan Turing was an authentic genius, and one of the fathers of the digital computer. He is also a member of the Pantheon of Gay Martyrs, along with Oscar Wilde, Matthew Sheppard, and the 1980s AIDS Victims. On both accounts, he deserves a much better movie than this one. Never mind the gross simplifications and historical inaccuracies of his role in breaking Enigma -- that's just Hollywood dramatic license. Never mind that we are shown nothing of the sex life of an unhappily closeted gay man during the age of persecution. Never mind that we aren't shown his suicide by poisoned apple. The essential point is that we don't grasp the essence of the character because we're never shown anything of what he did or how he did it. As one of Turing's colleagues says (quote approximate), 'if you're going to play the eccentric genius, you have to BE a genius.' This movie shows us only the eccentricity, and requires us to take the genius completely on faith. We are shown no trial and error, no conversations among colleagues, absolutely nothing to let us understand what the problem was, or what Turing saw that others didn't. All we get is a difficult, misunderstood individual, somewhere on the Asperger's spectrum, who turns out to be right when everybody else is wrong. Zero Dark Thirty does a much better job of presenting that kind of character precisely because it shows the thought processes involved.",5,9,19,30 December 2014
Prisoners," Americanism Through Foreign Eyes
","Writing about James Fennimore Cooper, D.H. Lawrence said, 'the essential American soul is hard, stoic, isolate and a killer. It has never yet melted.' Prisoners is a Canadian director's meditation on this passage.Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans opened with Hawkeye shooting a deer and then praying over the dead animal. Prisoners opens with Keller Dover (Jackman) saying the Lord's Prayer as his teenaged son sights in and shoots the deer that will be Thanksgiving dinner. The parallel is no accident. Dover thinks of himself as the Deerslayer. He's a self-employed, self-reliant workman with a basement full of canned goods and ammunition stored against the breakdown of society, which he expects at any time. He's a survivalist and a handloader. He lives in a nondescript former industrial town somewhere in the part of Pennsylvania that James Carville described as Alabama. His suburban house is the smallest in the neighborhood, with the siding stained dark brown, looking like a log cabin. His only vehicle is the pickup truck from his contracting business. He seems to have come down in the world from his late father, whom he revered, and he's just barely keeping up with the mortgage. Though not a political word is spoken, he's prime Tea Party material. His belief in himself and his disdain for institutions are going to be tested to the extreme when his five year old daughter and her neighborhood playmate disappear, victims of an apparent abduction, on Thanksgiving afternoon.This is a foreigner's take on the United States. The director, Denis Villeneuve, is a French-Canadian whose last movie, 2010s Incindies, was a perceptive look at the Lebanon civil war of the 70s and 80s. Villeneuve is looking at a society whose individualism, distrust of authority, and general availability of firearms are very different from Canada, and he does not take those things for granted in the same way an American director would. Prisoners makes an interesting companion to this summer's Still Mine, a Canadian story about an old fashioned self-employed individualist who falls foul of local authority in rural New Brunswick. I've long thought that the Canadians are King George's dutiful children while Americans are his rebellious ones, and the two pictures set off the contrast nicely. This is an anthropological look by a Canadian at what a very American man like Keller Dover might do when his child is kidnapped.Villeneuve uses one of the more annoying tropes in American movies to humanize Dover – the Validating Black Guy. Cousin to the Magic Negro, who puts the white protagonist in touch with deeper values, the VBG's function is simpler – to show that this white man, regardless of his other faults, is actually all right because he likes black people and they like him. Dover's neighbor, friend and one-time high school buddy Franklin Birch (Howard) and wife Nancy (Davis) are cast as black because otherwise Keller Dover would come across as a complete redneck.But the essence of the Birches is class, not race. They live in a nicer house and are much more securely in the middle class than the Dovers. Nancy's a veterinarian and Franklin looks like he has some kind of office job. Their function is to react as decent, normal middle class folks would when their daughter is abducted and when Dover goes off the rails looking for the kidnapper. The parallel with our reactions to 9/11 is pretty obvious, but that's not where the movie ultimately goes.The spousal relations break pretty clearly along class and historical lines. Nancy and Franklin Birch are a contemporary married couple of the upper middle class. They pull each other through. He confides in her, she's probably the stronger of the pair, and her moral judgments are the last word between them. The Dovers are almost 19th century. Grace Dover (an under-used Maria Bello) is passive; a pure housewife who looks to Keller as her protector and hero. She breaks completely under the strain, spending all of her time in bed under sedation. Her husband is content to have it so, keeping his activities secret and warning his son not to let his mother know what is going on.Dover's opposite number and antagonist is Detective Loki, the star of this small town police force, and apparently the only detective on the case. (I find this improbable. For a crime like the abduction of two five year old girls, a one horse police department would get overwhelming support from State Police detectives). Loki is zealous, smart, though not as smart as he thinks, and willing to fall back on shouting and violence when nothing else seems to work. He's cracked every case he ever worked on, and he expects to crack this one. He's also got the official mindset that regards Keller Dover's insistent involvement as a clear nuisance if not something worse. But he's got far more energy and drive than his police chief, a mediocre man who has learned to rationalize mediocrity with philosophical resignation.The plot is full of trap doors and red herrings, and you have to pay very close attention to the dialog to pick up what you need to know. Even if you do, I think that one key element is left unexplained. You will be completely involved in what comes next for two and one-half hours, and there will be a lot to chew on when it's over. Definitely worth it.",7,14,26,15 October 2013
Hotel Mumbai," Too Real To Be Entertaining
","Well made but ultimately disappointing because it defies the expectations for this kind of movie. John McClane never shows up, and we aren't even given the kind of desperate, suicidal resistance of the passengers in United 93. Instead, the characters with which the American audience identifies -- which is to say the rich, mostly Western, mostly white ones -- behave all too much like real life. They sneak about in fear and confusion, and when caught by the frighteningly well supplied murderers, they are either killed outright or herded about passively at gunpoint. The only act of defiance by one is late and futile. The guests who survive do so mostly by chance or by slipping out the back way pointed out by the Indian staff.The movie does make the young murderers seem human without 'humanizing' them. Through the cell phone voice of their commander safe in Pakistan, we are never in any doubt that they are driven by seething resentment and have been thoroughly taught to see all non-Muslims as subhumans to be killed without remorse. Nonetheless, small bits of business show them to be all too believable young men rather than robots. One plays a practical joke on his partner involving room service food. Another is such a puritan that, despite his commander's orders, he can't bring himself to put his hand inside the bra of a woman he has murdered in order to retrieve her identity papers. A third calls his family on the cell phone -- they are proud of what he is doing, he is concerned that they haven't yet been paid the money they were promised for him doing it. We are reminded that they are all too human.",6,5,14,29 April 2019
Up," Willingly Suspended Disbelief
","When asked if Disney's Pocahontas was historically accurate, one critic replied, 'It's got a talking raccoon, for God's sake.' So here. Old Man Fredrikson lifts his house off the ground with thousands of toy balloons. An 8 year old with a GPS navigates the house to South America, steering with a coffee grinder attached to two shower curtains. When they get there, Fredriksen meets his childhood hero from the 1930s, who is still upright and vigorous, albeit embittered and paranoid, at age 100+. Just go with the fantasy, talking dog collars and all. There's always plenty going on in a Pixar film.I'll skip over the love story, which stands out, to a couple of less conspicuous points. I loved the dogs, who spoke what we'd like to think are dog thoughts. And anyone who thinks they lowered the tone of the movie should consider the wide range of dog behavior that Pixar left out and most animation studios would have wallowed in.I also loved the contrasts between the 8 year olds: Carl and Ellie delighted with a few found objects and their imaginations, and Russell laden with every piece of gear money could buy. And the contrast between the two views of nature: Muntz, wanting to catch it and put it in a museum Teddy Roosevelt style, and Russell wanting to leave it in place. The manly hero of 70 years ago has soured into a fascistic bully by modern standards. The politics are a lot more subtle than The Incredibles or Wall-E, but they're in there just the same.",9,2,4,8 June 2009
Woman in Gold," Interesting But Could Have Been Better
","A good, solid job, no more, no less, but it could have used more focus on the flashbacks to Altman's life in Vienna before she escaped in 1939.Billy Wilder, who grew up in Vienna, once said that the Austrians were the cleverest people in the world – they had convinced everyone that Beethoven was an Austrian and Hitler was a German. After the Third Reich lost, the Austrians managed to portray the Anschluss as Hitler's first conquest and themselves as his first victim. In actuality, Hitler was welcomed with immense enthusiasm and large numbers of Austrians were devoted Nazis. That's not surprising because Hitler's view of the world was essentially Austro-German, both the belief that the Germans were the natural rulers over an empire of Slavs and the ferocious middle class anti-Semitism.Late Hapsburg and post-1918 Vienna had a large, prosperous Jewish upper middle class, prominent in finance, industry and intellectual pursuits, thoroughly assimilated to Austro-German high culture, who had been protected, if not exactly embraced, by Kaiser Franz Josef and the Hapsburg aristocracy. They were also envied and hated by the gentile craftsmen and shopkeepers of Vienna, who repeatedly elected anti- Semite Karl Lueger as mayor despite the opposition of the Kaiser and the government. Lueger was a populist reformer, a proponent of social welfare legislation, and a great builder of infrastructure, not unlike LaGuardia. A devout Catholic himself, Lueger realized that any populist mass movement in Vienna would have to be anti-Semitic to succeed, and he regularly denounced the Jews. Hitler saw him as a model, both as an anti-Semite and as a charismatic politician. Until very recently, he was memorialized in Vienna street names, and there are still statues of him there.The movie's best scenes are street scenes in Vienna in the aftermath of the Anschluss, where Jews are forced scrub anti-Nazi graffiti off the sidewalks, to paint 'Jude' on their businesses, and to have their beards and sidelocks shorn. The crowds of gentile onlookers are not merely curious; they're as excited and happy to see justice being done as crackers at a lynching. In Altman's dealings with modern Austrian bureaucrats, the movie subtly conveys the sense that, though not Nazis themselves, they are content to see the Jews gone and have no more intention of giving back the loot than Americans have of giving Texas back to the Comanches. What Altman wants from the Austrians is a confession that they are the knowing receivers of stolen goods and that their ancestors participated enthusiastically in the theft. She never gets it, which is why the Klimt now hangs in the Neue Galerie in New York.",6,24,39,6 April 2015
Enemy at the Gates," Lame Version Of A Well Known Story
","Zaitsev and Chernova are historical figures: both became Heroes of the Soviet Union. The duel between Zaitsev and the German übersniper is a well known part of the Stalingrad story, even though its authenticity is strongly disputed. David Robbins's 1999 novel War of the Rats is a much better fictional telling of the tale, and much truer to the details of the sniper's craft.The producers of Enemy at the Gates either couldn't or wouldn't buy the rights to Robbins's novel, and much of the script appears to have been written to avoid infringing the novel's characterizations and incidents. The German's death at the climax of the story suffers in particular -- it reminds me of nothing so much as the 'clever girl' scene from Jurassic Park.As written, Enemy of the Gates follows pretty closely the standard boxing movie of the 1930s and 40s. Think of Zaitsev as the Fighter, Commisar Danilov as the Scrappy Manager, Chernova as The Girl Who Comes Between Them, Khruschev as the Sinister Promoter, and the German as the Brutal Adversary In The Big Fight, and it all fits.",5,1,2,28 February 2006
The Holiday," Just What It Should Be
","What can you say about a movie where an adorable little girl looks Cameron Diaz up and down and says very gravely, in a posh English accent, 'You look like one of my Barbies.' In my opinion this is Nancy Meyers's best piece of work. She gets terrific performances from all four romantic leads, the two little girls, and Eli Wallach as a Jewish fairy godmother. Diaz and Law seem like they should obviously fall into bed together. You have to suspend a bit of disbelief at the Winslett-Black couple, but Meyers does a superb job of bringing Winslett plausibly down to Black's level, both in the writing of the character and in physical appearance. Everybody who belongs together gets together, after overcoming obstacles that are entirely within themselves. And, as usual in a Nancy Meyers movie, the interiors are gorgeous.",6,0,0,20 March 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," Animal House
","There has been a lot of argument among critics as to whether Scorsese endorses or condemns the wretched excess portrayed in this movie. It depends, I think, on the viewer's own values.More than anything else, the movie reminded me of the Samuel Johnson quote that Hunter Thompson used as the epigraph to Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas: 'He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man.' Belfort and his crew are a certain kind of American man, and their beastliness is an effort to assuage the pain of being where they are on the social scale.From watching Nancy Meyers movies, I've learned that how they consume is evidence of rich people's inner state. Money multiplies choices, and enough gives you the chance to do whatever you want. So the question becomes – what do you want? For Jordan Belfort and the (mostly) guys he recruits, the answer is life as a permanent beer commercial. All they can think of to do with the money is to buy sex, to buy drugs, and to buy stuff that shows everyone else you can afford to buy it. If you're a 23 year old lower middle class young man, as Belfort was at the beginning of the movie, the prospect may well be irresistible. For someone else, maybe not so much. I found their behavior to be grotesquely funny and Belfort, his crew and his trophy wife to be objects of disdain – the cast of Jersey Shore on steroids, who have no idea what to do with what they have, and who cannot communicate without bluster and obscenity. These are people who obscurely sense that they are looked down on by their betters, who are enraged by that fact, and who gleefully act out their rage by theft and by flash consumption. There's one scene that makes the rage clear. Belfort invites the FBI agent pursuing him down to his yacht at the World Financial Center marina. First he offers food, then drink, then financial assistance. When the FBI man quietly calls him on it, Belfort drops his cool Master of the Universe act, tells the FBI to get the f* off his boat, and ends by tossing $100 bills at him to show how rich he is. Belfort can feel the agent looking at him like pond scum, and he can't stand it.We see almost nothing of how Belfort and crew make the money. Speaking through the fourth wall, Belfort, which is to say Scorsese, repeatedly tells the audience that we don't care about how it's done, or what it means, and only want to see how it gets spent. What we are shown is the con man's contempt for the mark as someone just as greedy as he is but much, much stupider. As far as Belfort is concerned, the guy on the other end of the phone deserves to be swindled because he thinks of the stock market as a magic genie that will make him rich without effort or understanding, and because he is too stupid to know what he doesn't know.Belfort is more disconcerting than Henry Hill or Frank Costello because he's a lot closer to us. These other Scorsese protagonists are blue collar thugs who make their money through physical violence. Belfort starts out middle class, and he makes his money through a fraudulent variant on what is otherwise legitimate activity. It's a lot easier to imagine ourselves, or our kids, doing what he does, which makes the respectable upper middle class viewer uneasy.He's also more disconcerting than Irving Rosenfeld because he doesn't know his place. Rosenfeld believes in the small time con as both safe and sufficient. Belfort wants to be somebody. He's moving up the financial food chain from pump and dump to underwriting IPOs, and he wants his Long Island boiler room with the fake WASP name to be recognized as a real member of the club. He's also desperate for adulation – he walks away from a deal with the SEC because he can't stand a future without the adoration of his crew. But he never learns how to wear the mask of respectability, as Madoff did. He deliberately refuses to learn because he thinks enough money will force the establishment to accept him on his own terms, without needing the veneer of respectable manners. He is white trash rich and proud of his trashiness.",6,0,1,28 March 2014
The Good Shepherd," Heavy Handed Failure
","Ralph Rosenblum, who edited Annie Hall, writes in his memoir that one of the scenes that wound up on the cutting room floor had Woody Allen fantasizing about his parents being WASPs like the Halls instead of immigrant Brooklyn Jews. His father asks his mother for a martini, and she says, 'Of course. How would you like it, dear.' He replies, 'On white bread with mayonnaise.' That about sums up De Niro's view of the emotionally closed WASP characters in this movie. Scorsese could have made a masterpiece out of this material. De Niro is both tone deaf and resentful.The key passage is the only point in the movie that Damon's character shows any emotion or reveals what he thinks about his work. He is trying to enlists the help of an old Mafia don, played by Joe Pesci, against Castro. Pesci says to him, ' We've got family. The Irish have the homeland. The Jews have their tradition. Even the n*****s have their music. What have you people got?' Damon replies, in a cold and priggish tone, 'We have the United States of America. The rest of you people are just visiting.' That's De Niro's perspective: these arrogant snobs, who actually weren't very good at their work, believed that they owned the country as their birthright. It's too simplistic.De Niro is very clear that these gentleman spies were failures. Damon's career at the CIA is presented as a succession of blunders and blown operations, culminating in the Bay of Pigs. He is consistently manipulated and duped by his Soviet counterpart. A man who is personally and professionally suspicious of everyone, the only two people he trusts are a Soviet defector who is a plant and a British agent, modeled on Philby, who is working for the Russians. Both, of course, betray him. The movie ends in 1961 with Damon getting promoted in the post-Bay of Pigs shake up, but we the audience know that defeat in Vietnam is on its way.Regardless of its politics, the movie doesn't work as a movie. Damon doesn't age plausibly from 20 year old Yale junior to 42 year old CIA apparatchik; in the 1961 sequences he looks like a teenager costumed as Robert McNamara for Halloween. The sequence in which Angelina Jolie drags him into the woods and jumps his bones within hours of meeting him seems grossly unmotivated -- nice girls of that class simply didn't behave that way in 1940. The only plausible explanation I've heard is that she was already pregnant by an unsuitable boyfriend and needed to pin it on a marriageable dupe, but there's no support or confirmation in the movie. Too many characters rear back and make moralizing speeches. The plot unfolds with absolute predictability, and the key revelation is telegraphed. Most importantly, there is no catharsis. The crisis of the movie plays utterly flat. We get no sense of Damon's inner life and no sense that his experience has done anything but numb him. It's a long way from Michael Corleone at the lake house, and its a long, uninvolving 150 minutes.In an odd way, The Good Shepherd reminds me of The Truman Show. Damon's life is a pattern of manipulation by forces that he doesn't understand -- from his recruitment to the OSS, to his shotgun wedding, to the way his Soviet opposite number sets him up like a bowling pin. In particular, the displacement of his true love by the woman whom he must marry if he is to pursue the destiny imposed on him is an almost direct parallel to the way Laura Linney is plopped into Jim Carey's lap. Unlike Truman, he never figures it out.",4,2,6,3 January 2007
Parasite," Wow!
","That was my reaction. Parasite starts as a sardonic black comedy about the relations between a poor family and a rich one in present day Seoul before veering off in an entirely unexpected, much darker, almost surreal direction.The protagonists are the impoverished Kim family. Dad is a Micawber like optimistic fatalist, who has failed at numerous jobs but always expects something to turn up. Mom is solid and practical, a one-time high school track star, who keeps things together. The mid-20s daughter and college-age son are smart, quick, glib and nervy, willing to do whatever it takes, but they don't seem to have found their footing. They don't always agree, but they stick together.The Kims live in a cramped, squalid basement apartment in the kind of neighborhood where drunks piss in the street. The scrape up a little money folding boxes for neighborhood pizzeria, none too competently. As we meet them, they have just lost free wi-fi because the neighbor upstairs has passworded her router. Dad advises the kids to hold their phones up and move around the apartment to see if they can catch a signal. They do, up on the ledge where the toilet sits. That's Dad's strategy for life in a nutshell.Deliverance arrives in the form of Son's high school buddy Min, now in college. Min has a gig tutoring English to the 15 year old daughter of a very rich family. He's going to study abroad for a year, and he wants Son to hold his place till he gets back. Min intends to start dating the girl when she's old enough, and he figures Son will be a harmless substitute. Son did well on the English part of the college entrance exam, and Min assures him that he can bs his way through.The rich family, named Park, live in a gorgeous, spacious modern mansion on a hill, formerly the home of a renowned modern architect who has since moved on to bigger things in Paris. The father is the kind of Korean global businessman who has been the subject of an admiring profile in the New York Times. Mrs. Park is described by Min as 'slow,' which isn't quite right. She's an oblivious but nice lady, more ornamental than useful, who depends on a middle aged housekeeper and who dotes on and spoils her hyperactive 8 year old son. You might call her street dumb. The same is true of her husband, who knows his way around business but is not as worldly wise as he thinks he is.The Parks are insulated from the realities of everyday life by a thick cushion of money, and they think the world works the way it's supposed to. Park is always concerned that the family servants 'don't cross the line' into familiarity. He and his wife assume that anything American is automatically first class and, to show their sophistication, they pepper their Korean conversation with scraps of English the way Miss Piggy uses French.With the help of a diploma forged by Daughter Kim on Photoshop, Son aces his interview with Mrs. Park and gets hired to give English lessons 2 or 3 afternoons a week. In short order, he and the girl are also making out when Mom's back is turned. Son sees the boy's weird paintings pinned up on the fridge. He suggests to Mrs. Park that the boy could use art therapy and that he just happens to know an American trained art therapist. Mrs. Park swallows the bait, Daughter Kim bluffs her way through the interview with a combination of arrogance and art therapy buzz words she's picked up on the internet, and in short order she's having regular sessions with the little boy. Now that they're through the Parks' gate, the Kim kids manipulate things so that the chauffeur gets fired and is replaced by Dad, and the housekeeper gets fired and is replaced by Mom. They never let on that they're all related. The Parks don't have a clue. When the little boy notices that the new driver smells just like his art teacher, Mr. Park brushes it off because all the people who ride the subway smell the same.'At the halfway point, this has just been an amusing and quite enjoyable story of the clever, scrappy poor putting one over on the clueless, entitled rich. The Kims are making a very good living off the Parks and eating better than they have in a long time. Of course we know that the Kims will somehow screw up this honeypot and be threatened with discovery and disaster. Things do spiral out of control, but in a completely unexpected way. I can't say how without a major spoiler; let's just say that the Park mansion conceals some extraordinary secrets and that the injuries that the Kims have inflicted come back to haunt them. Their struggle to stave off detection starts as slapstick but gets more and more desperate, and it builds to a climax that you don't see coming but is completely foreshadowed and leaves you wrung out. Definitely worth it.One sidelight for American viewers. Mr. Kim and one other character have each gone broke in the 'Taiwanese Cake' business. I googled that. It turns out that there is a pattern in South Korean life of fads giving rise to a large number number of opportunistic but undercapitalized small businesses that fail when the fad runs its course. Taiwanese Cake was one of them, the equivalent of the US cupcake fad of 10 years ago.",8,1,5,15 November 2019
The Big Short," Smart Greed
","Harry Knowles once wrote a review of Das Boot that said the movie was so well made that you'd find yourself rooting for Nazi sailors trying to sink American ships. So here. You find yourself rooting for clever 'outsiders and weirdos,' as one of them puts it, who saw what nobody else wanted to see -- that an immense structure of mortgage based securities was doomed to collapse because it rested on the backs of subprime borrowers who couldn't support the weight and should never have been loaned the money. We have been taught by generations of fiction to identify with characters who are outsiders and rebels. Because these guys are smart, because they are antisocial and because they were laughed at by smug fools who believed the conventional wisdom, you identify with them, and you wait anxiously for their vindication. Then you realize that their vindication means the collapse of the American economy. They were the guys on the Titanic who knew what the iceberg meant and booked reserved seats in the lifeboats.Michael Lewis, from whose book the movie was adapted, got his training at Salomon Brothers in the mid-80s, as mortgage based securities were being invented. (There's an early shout-out to Lew Ranieri, the Salomon trader who invented them.) As anyone knows who's read Lewis's memoir of those days, Liar's Poker, the culture at Salomon was that your job was to be smarter than everybody else in the bond market, understand values better, and know what other traders were going to do before they knew it themselves. If you were smart enough, you deserved whatever you took away from somebody less smart on the other side of the trade. That's why Lewis admires his protagonists and that, despite a thick coating of moral outrage, is the heart of the movie. The guys who shorted the housing market weren't any more virtuous or less greedy than the great majority of complacent, conventionally minded bankers who believed that the trees would keep growing all the way up to the sky. They just saw more clearly and had plenty of nerve and faith in their own judgment. If they had been wrong, as shorts often are, they and their clients would have been wiped out. When they turned out right, they took the money and kept it, even if some of them felt guilty about it.I know somewhat about this area, having litigated some of the aftermath. The celebrity cameo explanations of subprime debt, collateralized debt obligations, and synthetic CDOs are not only simple but accurate -- the two involving Anthony Bourdain and Selena Gomez are downright elegant. The key concept of the credit default swap comes out nicely through the dialogue -- a chance to buy fire insurance on the house down the street just before it catches fire. There are a couple of more points that could have used the same thing, especially when people start talking about 'FICO scores.' It could also have been a little more clear that the eventual collapse was delayed because the smarter investment banks like Goldman finally woke up, saw it coming, unloaded their CDO inventory on investors who were still asleep, and cut their losses by buying swaps themselves. But this is a smart, entertaining telling of an outrageous true story. It deserves all the praise it has gotten, and maybe an Oscar for best adapted screenplay. If it teaches people without a financial background a little of what went on, it will be more than a momentary entertainment. But it will certainly entertain.",8,156,190,28 December 2015
Saving Mr. Banks," A Hollywood Seduction
","I found this as distasteful as You've Got Mail, and for much the same reasons. A powerful man with a veneer of amiability (played in both cases by Tom Hanks) attains the object of his desire by overcoming and taking possession of a female adversary through a questionably sincere appeal to her emotions.A medieval French nobleman is supposed to have said, 'Tell them anything, just get them in bed.' That's the story of this movie. Disney desperately wants the rights to Mary Poppins. Travers doesn't want to give up control and risk having her creation vulgarized. Disney tries the whole arsenal of Hollywood charm. The unbendingly British Travers is immune and impervious. Disney finally cracks her after his people find out the back story of her traumatized childhood in Australia. The scene in which he appeals to her sympathy and finally wins her trust by recounting his own childhood misery is a masterwork of fake sincerity. Once her signature is on the Disney contract, she is no longer an object of desire but a problem who must be managed lest she interfere with the marketing of the movie. She is not pleased with the result, but her objections don't matter. In sum, this is a microcosm account of the contempt with which Hollywood treats the writers of literary property that it wants to adapt to its own purposes, told not from the perspective of the embittered writer but with the smug satisfaction of the victorious studio. It is, in short, the locker room account of a conquest, and all the more distasteful for being well told.",5,5,9,20 December 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Disappointing
","I don't think this would work well as a stand alone movie for someone who hasn't read the books. It isn't the performers' fault; they give it their all, or a little bit more. There are some fundamental script problems.First,the PG-13 rating. Haymitch is a very sober drunk, and we don't see Katniss get hammered with him when the QQ is announced. No avoxes. Peeta has two good legs. Cray isn't an exploiter of young girls.Second, not enough hunger. Katniss is extremely conscious of food. The party scene works as well as it does in the book because , despite herself, she really enjoys the delicacies she's eating. That makes her revulsion over the vomit producing drink even stronger, because it stops her from being seduced by the Capitol's luxuries. In the movie it has to be spelled out.Third, the books have texture because of the way Katniss interacts with minor characters: her prep team, Cray, Darius, Madge, Hazelle, Greasy Sae, even Prim's cat that she can't stand. As in Casablanca, the bit players provide color and background that make the major characters stand out. That's missing in the script, which is why we never get a sense of the community Katniss comes from that has made her who she it. The destruction of the Hob doesn't matter because we never see it in operation, and we don't miss District 12 because we barely get to know it from a few establishing shots of industrial squalor.So we get a workmanlike portrayal of the major plot points, while the reader provides depth that isn't on the screen.",6,1,9,12 May 2014
Her," Familiar Plot, Interesting Setting
","When I first saw Jurassic Park, I said to myself, 'if they can make dinosaurs in the computer, they can make anything in the computer.' In Her, they make the Manic Pixie Dream Girl in the computer, or rather they make the computer into the Manic Pixie Dream Girl. While the outlines of the society in which Theodore Twombly lives are interestingly discomfiting, the plot is just a knockoff of 500 Days of Summer, complete with an implied consolatory rebound romance at the end.The movie illustrates the truth that the only real male erogenous zone is the ego. What Theodore loves about Samantha is that she is, or seems to be, his worshipful inferior -- not only a perfect servant, but a naive young mind eagerly open to the experience that he is going to provide. There's a kind of pedophilic teacher-student vibe until Samantha outgrows him and dumps him for maturity, not unlike Diane Keaton at the end of Annie Hall and Mariel Hemmingway at the end of Manhattan.",6,1,3,9 February 2014
The Great Gatsby," When Jazz Was New And Frightening
","This was a much better movie than the misleadingly cut trailer made it out to be. Luhrman avoided the temptation of being taken in by the glitz. The parties -- both Tom's little mud wallow with Myrtle and Gatsby's extravaganzas -- are as chaotic, as crass and as hollow as they should be. The anachronistic music make emotional sense where its used. DiCaprio is an excellent Gatsby -- a man visibly playing a part, watching himself play it, anxious about being found out, and urgently delusional about Daisy. Tobey Maguire plays Nick as a wide eyed naif from the Midwest, almost a bumpkin. Joel Edgerton is a very convincing Tom -- self assured, bullying, pedantic, proprietary, contemptuous of his inferiors, but far more intelligent than he first looks. He and DiCaprio really bring off the confrontation at the Plaza that is the story's climax. Carey Mulligan is an adequate Daisy, who is anyway mostly a projection of Gatsby's; she's petulant, bored, resentful of Tom's infidelities, ready for a fling with a lost girlhood love, but nothing more than that. Elizabeth Debicki is underused as a magnetic Jordan Baker, and Isla Fisher has great fun playing Myrtle Wilson as a working class floozy.Luhrman has made some interesting changes of emphasis. Nick is much more callow and innocent than the narrator of the novel; he seems 21 rather than almost 30. His relationship with Jordan disappears. Gatsby's father never makes an appearance after his son's death. Instead, much of the back story he tells Nick in the novel is confessed by Gatsby himself. In the novel Nick states that he had 'always disapproved' of Gatsby; the movie is much more of a bromance. The wild vulgarity of the apartment party is only implied the book, and the lunch with Wolfsheim takes place in a flamboyant speakeasy with a chorus line of highly sexualized black dancers instead of in a restaurant. In the book, Nick is fascinated, frightened and also disgusted by Wolfsheim. The movie keeps the fascination and fear but plays down the disgust. Wolfsheim never tells Nick the full story of his relationship with Gatsby, as he does in the book after Gatsby dies. Instead, we hear part of it from Tom.Luhrman's treatment of the novel makes sense when you put Gatsby in its political context and see the story through Tom Buchanan's eyes. The 1920 Census was the first one in which a majority of Americans lived in cities instead of farms and small towns. The second and third generation of Ellis Island immigrants were becoming a political force. The movies, a business conspicuously dominated by Jews, had grown from nothing to become the most popular entertainment medium in less than 20 years. Jazz had become the dominant popular music, both in its raw African-American form and as mediated by the Jews of Tin Pan Alley. The movies were feared as seductively immoral, and jazz denounced for releasing impulses that decent people never spoke of, much less acted out in public. Young people were engaging in what their elders thought was intolerable sexual license. Organized crime, the product of Prohibition, operated with an open, shameless defiance of the law never seen before. Books like Madison Grant's The Passing of the Great Race (1916) predicted that Nordic civilization would be overwhelmed and swept away by inferior races unless eugenic measures were taken to improve the breed. Small town Protestant America was in a full scale moral and demographic panic that seems very familiar today.Native white Protestant rural and small town Americans felt their country slipping away from them, and they struck back. The modern Ku Klux Klan was formed in 1915. From 1919 into the early 20s white mobs attacked black communities throughout the country. There were mass deportations of alien, mostly Jewish, radicals in 1919-20. Prohibition was enacted in 1920 through the decades long lobbying of the organized Protestant churches. The Immigration Acts of 1920 and 1924 effectively cut off the immigration of Italians, Slavs and Jews. Luhrman is trying to recapture the atmosphere of traditional America assaulted by frightening new forces. That's why he makes blacks so conspicuous, as servants, as entertainers and, once, as mysteriously prosperous revelers. Because jazz has become familiar, respectable, classical music, he uses hip-hop to recapture the fearful sense of black moral degeneracy infiltrating white society from below. Because Jews are now an accepted and highly visible part of American society, he uses an Indian actor, Amitabh Bachchan, to better communicate the exotic menace that Jewish gangster Meyer Wolfsheim had in 1922. Most importantly, that's why Luhrman puts Tom Buchanan's strident, pedantic racism front and center, when other aspects of the novel are deemphasized or cut. And it's why, at the climax of the movie, the most damning thing Tom can say about Gatsby is not just that he's a bootlegger but that he -- a real American -- is really a front for 'that kike Wolfsheim' in some mysterious financial fraud. Though that expression is true to Tom's character, it isn't in the book. Luhrman's Gatsby isn't just a self-made nouveau riche vulgar outsider, though he is all that, and he isn't just trying to 'make a rumpus' in Tom Buchanan's house and steal away his wife in the name of romance. Gatsby is the agent of subversive forces attacking the civilization that supports Tom and Daisy's place in the world. He is exposed, he fails, Daisy rejects him and Tom destroys him. But ninety years later those forces have triumphed. We are living in the world Tom Buchanan feared, and that Fitzgerald saw struggling to be born. Luhrman is trying to remind us just how contentious that birth was.",7,7,13,15 May 2013
Valkyrie," Misses The Point
","Valkyrie's account of the failed plot to kill Hitler is no more than a thriller that does not thrill. In theory, it is possible to tell a suspense story about a historical event with a known outcome. Although we know de Gaulle was never assassinated, Day of the Jackal pulls its audience along with the intricate details of how the fictional killer almost brings it off, and how the French security services thwart him at the last minute. It works as a howdunnit. But the story of the plot to kill Hitler is a whydunnit, and Valkyrie takes the why for granted. Because the Nazis give us the luxury of both hindsight and moral certainty, they make us lazy. We know they are absolutely evil, and we know they are going to lose the war. So it is easy to take for granted that Stauffenberg and the other conspirators are making the right choice. They know the regime is evil, they know the war is lost, and they want to make a statement and maybe salvage something from the wreck. It's just what we would think in their place – or so we flatter ourselves.But that reaction is superficial because we are not in their place but in our place, looking back at theirs. What Valkyrie should have done is taken the audience mentally into a world where the Nazis are the established, legitimate government and all good patriots want Germany to win the war, or at least to escape defeat. That takes more than swastika flags over every post office. It takes the creation through dialog of a social atmosphere in which Nazism is conventional and right. Without that baseline, the conspirators' decision to overthrow their own government and embrace defeat is trivial. How have these few men come to think that Hitler is evil and crazy when everyone else still follows him? What led them to choose what everyone around them thinks is wrong? Valkyrie doesn't tell us. Tom Cruise looks like pictures of Stauffenberg, but he conveys nothing of the man's inner life. Without that, Valkyrie has less point than Swing Kids.",5,0,0,25 May 2015
From Here to Eternity," Gelded By The Production Code
","This is the best book ever written about life as an enlisted man in the Regular Army, but you'd never know it from the sanitized version put on screen. James Jones's novel was both romantically cynical about the Army and deeply misogynistic. In the early 1950s it couldn't be filmed as written, for both moral and political reasons. In the book, of course, Mrs. Kipfer runs a whorehouse, not a social club, and Lorene is a whore with an eye for the main chance, not a hostess. In the book, Holmes gets away with his abuse of Prewitt, winning promotion by sucking up to his superior's superior. In the book, Maggio succeeds in getting a Section 8 psychiatric discharge. In the book, the underpaid privates are willing to flirt with wealthy homosexuals, and there is a mass 'queer investigation.' In the book, Prewitt is impressed by Jack Molloy, the working class radical he meets in the stockade. In the book, Warden rejects both a proffered commission and Karen Holmes because he would rather stay an enlisted man and amuse himself with whores than be trapped in respectable middle class domesticity. In the book, Prewitt's desire for Lorene and Warden's for Karen make them weak, stupid and vulnerable -- Warden saves himself but Prewitt does not. In the book, Lorene goes back to the mainland with the money she's saved, to get a respectable job and pass herself off as the fiancée of Lieutenant Prewitt, of the Virginia Prewitts, killed at Pearl Harbor. None of these things make it into the movie. The book ends with Warden enthusiastically getting to know a new shipment of girls at Mrs. Kipfer's. The movie ends with a tacked on coda in which Holmes is duly punished for Prewitt's suffering. The 1979 miniseries came a bit closer to what Jones was trying to accomplish. Maybe one day HBO will give us a six or eight hour From Here To Eternity as it was meant to be.",6,2,2,16 February 2014
Atonement," Imaginary Attonement
","Voltaire wrote that history is a pack of tricks that the living play upon the dead. The point of Atonement appears to be that history is a pack of tricks the living play upon themselves because it is more comforting that way. We are shown the newsreel story of Dunkirk as epic of British pluck and endurance, compared with a purportedly real account of Dunkirk as spectacular balls up. In parallel, we see Briony's fictional tidying up of the mess she has made compared with the actual unhappy and unresolvable consequences. Although she knows the truth, she is still trying to persuade herself that her fiction restored something irretrievably lost that it was beyond her power to restore in fact.",7,0,3,17 December 2007
