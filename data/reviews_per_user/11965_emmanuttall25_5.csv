Hereditary," I don't think iv ever been so terrified!!!
","My first Review I just had to with this film..... I love horror films I love getting scared I diddnt no anything about this film the acting was amazing especially from Toni Colette she had me feeling emotional on one scene. Brilliant actress. The story creeped me out I loved watching this family, it was so dark and eerie so believable, the way it made me feel was terrified not just the demon bits but just the way the family lived and what they were going through. I left this film and I said I never ever want to see this film again. I couldn't wait to get home I just wanted to feel safe. I can't think of any bad bits it was a brilliant film please go and watch it especially at the cinema as it will scare the living daylights out of you.",10,3,6,6 July 2018
The Lion King," It was alright
","I loved the Disney version growing up and I don't think Some Disney movies should be remade. As soon as the music started I started crying but that's because it took me back to my childhood and how much I loved this move. Word for word it's exactly the same as the Disney version, they look real which is probably the best bit. But for some reason I hated Beyonc√© singing on it. I don't feel the need to watch again it was just alright",6,5,5,31 August 2019

The Greatest Showman," So good I went to the cinema to watch 6 times......
","I can't express how amazing this film is, I diddnt no too much about it and I was blown away I cried laughed got goosebumps I loved every single second of it, even my husband was blown away and he hates musicals. So the next night I had to get my fix again so I begged my husband and we went to watch again, and then 2 days later. I just love everything about this film the acting the songs oh my god are the best songs to ever be written and sang. It's just a brilliant film there are no faults. Obsessed with this film and always will be",10,1,3,29 July 2018
