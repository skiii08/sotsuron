The Ring," Creepy stuff!
","The Ring is one of a few horror/suspense films that were both wonderfully crafted and genuinely creepy. The acting is very good and the direction (from Gore Verbinski who I was not impressed with since he did The Mexican) is also top notch. I recommend this film to those who can handle stuff like this, definitely not to everyone. I am suprised and quite shocked that The Ring was given a PG-13 rating in the US, I live in Australia and the rating here was MA - only for people 15 years and over unless accompanied by a parent or adult guardian. Some of the scenes in this are graphic and the rest is just plain freaky, with my only criticism being the ending. I won't give anything away of course but I thought it could've finished a few scenes earlier, it just seemed to go on and on. Despite the time issue, the concept of the ending is brilliant - alot of people have commented on how bad the ending is, but I think it's one of the best endings to a thriller I've ever seen.",Null,0,0,23 December 2002
That Thing You Do!," Tom Hanks - also a great director
","Tom Hanks has proved himself here as being a great director and writer as well as a superb actor. That Thing You Do! is a great film; with a standout soundtrack, good acting and a well told story. I have seen it many times and it is still just as good, this movie appeals to lovers of many different film genres.",8,0,0,26 April 2002
Dead Poets Society," Fantastic, don't miss this one
","Dead Poets Society is one of those movies that left me moved and shocked for a long period of time. The storyline is original and the acting is brilliant, not to mention Peter Weir's outstanding direction. It really goes to prove that Robin Williams isn't strictly a comic actor, and that in even the most serious of roles he can excel. There is, however, some comic relief in this movie from both Williams and the rest of the cast that adds to the enjoyment of this classic. For all moviegoers alike, don't miss this one - great to hear that films such as Dead Poets Society are being made by Australian directors!",Null,0,1,24 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Beautifully crafted and an overall delight to watch
","The acting is fantastic and the scenery filmed in New Zealand creates a visual feast for the audience, keeping them on the edge of their seats the whole time. Director Peter Jackson has put to screen a classic novel with style, receiving numerous Oscar nominations including best picture.
I am personally not a fan of fantasy whether it be literature or film, yet I thoroughly enjoyed The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring and I eagerly await the next two in the trilogy to appear in cinemas. It is definately a movie that must be seen on the big screen to fully appreciate what it has to offer - a wonderful tale with superb performances and visuals all round.",9,0,0,29 March 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Thoroughly enjoyable - an improvement on the original
","With a great cast and classic but still enjoyable story, Oceans Eleven is a must-see. Acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh has once again pleased audiences, with a great remake of the 1960 classic. The jazzy soundtrack is a bonus, and the special effects add to the positive elements. The remake isn't exactly the same as the original, in fact quite far from it, which is why viewers of the original Oceans Eleven won't basically be seeing the same film again if they try Soderbergh's version. It is more his interpretation, and not a frame by frame restoration like Gus Van Sant's approach to Hitchcock's Psycho. Ocean's Eleven keeps you entertained throughout the two hours, and not once swinging into boring mode.",Null,0,0,29 March 2002
Annie Hall," A genius 'intellectual comedy'
","I'm a huge fan of Woody Allen, and Annie Hall marked the beginning of my obsession. It makes me laugh every time I watch it, but it's comedy that doesn't rely on slapstick for laughs. It uses witty dialogue and surreal circumstances to achieve its purpose - and I admire Allen for pulling it off. Aside from this, Diane Keaton is a stand-out as the title character - it goes to show just how versatile her acting ability is, from The Godfather to this... Allen has been criticised in the past for using odd camera angles (such as the 'long-shots') and the like, but I think such techniques add to the enjoyment of the film. He has certainly created a trademark, even though he'd probably look back on the film full of distaste - it seems like that's the way he is.",Null,0,0,5 May 2004
A Beautiful Mind," This film should not be missed...
","Wow... Ron Howard has created such a powerful film that I will never forget. Russell Crowe plays John Nash brilliantly and I can easily see why he was nominated for Best Actor yet again. Jennifer Connelly is also in an Oscar winning performance here as Alicia Nash, and is fantastic (as are the entire cast). James Horner's soundtrack is absolutely wonderful and is yet another positive element in this cinematic masterpiece. Don't miss it....",10,0,1,29 March 2002
Love Actually," Fantastic! (actually)
","I first saw this film when it came out on the big screen and since then it has reappeared at home numerous times. I love this film! It's a brilliantly structured collage of different relationships that could prove to be subjects of effective films on their own. Richard Curtis should probably have been directing his scripts all along, because he certainly knows how to put together an enjoyable film (not to say that his previous works haven't been great as well). The top notch cast helps to deliver a film that's not only very funny, but also incredibly moving (particularly the relationship between the characters of Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman). Golden Globe nominee Bill Nighy was a stand out as Billy Mack - a has-been rock star 'trying to make a comeback'.",Null,1,5,5 May 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," One of my favourites
","Frank Darabont's film based on Steven King's story is absolutely inspirational. Great performances all round and it keeps the viewer attached throughout. The Shawshank Redemption is quite long, yet you don't notice it, instead you notice the genius that has gone into this film's creation. See this film, no matter what your movie preference.",10,0,0,30 March 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," Hello Clarice...
","What can I say? It is a classic that deserves every bit of credit it has received in the last ten years. Nobody can forget the harrowing and powerful performance by Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter, not to mention the other standout talents of Jodie Foster and Scott Glenn. If you are a horror fan or not, this film is definately a must-see - Thomas Harris's story is original and gripping and Jonathan Demme has visualised it in such a brilliant way that audiences are left shaking in their seats.",Null,0,0,24 March 2002
Trainspotting," Fantastic filmmaking
","Director Danny Boyle along with writers Irvine Welsh and John Hodge have created for us a powerful, funny and harrowing yarn about the Edinburgh drug scene. I can watch this movie many times and still enjoy it just as much. It is original and daring, with many scenes causing immense controversy after the film's release. I have no knowledge of the elements that the film is based on, yet I know enough to tell that Trainspotting is quite realistic - many say it praises drugs, but I view it does the very opposite and shows all the troubles the one goes through when in a situation like that of Mark Renton (McGregor). As a bonus, Trainspotting has a great soundtrack and the acting is superb all round. Check this one out, it won't appeal to everyone but nevertheless a great film.",Null,0,0,31 March 2002
