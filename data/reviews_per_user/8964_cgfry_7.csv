Requiem for a Dream," Ellen Burstyn is stunning
","This movie is really, really(!) depressing.  Punishing is the word another reviewer used, and that seems a good description.  I felt like someone had used a mental sledge hammer on me after watching.  I will not forget this movie for a long, long time.Considering the issues involved with 'recreational' and more serious drug use, and the real world consequences from both types, the movie is completely successful.  Ellen Burstyn is absolutely stunning and captivating:  her performance culminated in one of the most memorable, spellbinding, punishing (yeah, he was right about that!) endings I have ever seen in a movie.Jennifer Connelly's performance is riveting, and completely, depressingly, agonizingly believable.  Leto and Wayans do not detract with excellent performances.  Aronofsky provides incredible visuals with the movie.  I really enjoyed the kinetic elements involved with the drug use.  The movie has a great sound track.  Trainspotting is another absolutely riveting movie about drug use that I would compare to this.  Requiem is much more directly depressing, and especially through Burstyn and Connelly, more effective.  Watch this movie. Pick a night when you want to see something serious.  See if you can get your parents to watch it.  Make sure your older (at least the adult) children do.",9,0,1,27 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Top Ten Worst Plot Elements forced on George Lucas
","Forget the reviews suggesting Attack of the Clones is better than the Phantom Menace.  Episode II is by far the worst of the Star Wars movies. The only truly interesting aspect of Attack of the Clones is how _force_fully it proves the fact that special effects cannot make up for a poor (awful!!) story.  In this case, not only is the screenplay poorly written and the acting terrible, but the story elements themselves make absolutely no sense.  The plot failings are so strong as to spoil any assistance the special effects might have rendered.  Although I'm a big Star Wars fan, the movie is so bad that I give it only a 3 of 10 rating.Attack of the Clones should not appeal to any movie demographic, certainly not young children, who will be driven to sleep or bored desperation by the first 90 minutes of the movie.  Not to females, as the big love story is as poorly done as any in recent memory.  And not to males, as the big action scenes have been much better done in many other recent movies.  My sixteen-year-old came out of the movie saying that the most interesting part was the Matrix 2 trailer!The story is so bad that trying to laugh at it seems appropriate.  Here's my Top Ten List of Worst Plot Elements the Dark Side Forced upon George Lucas:10. One million clones.  Who ordered, who pays, who cares?9. Which deleted planet from the infallible archives is that?  Just ask your local chef.8. Can't find that deleted planet from the infallible archives?  No problem. Just fly right on in and say howdy.  They'll give you a million clones!7. Who are those guys on that deleted planet from the infallible archives? They're still nice, those Close Encounter's aliens (a Richard Dreyfuss cameo would'a helped).6. What's a once-Queen, now hugely important Senator do with her time?  No problem.  Turns out she actually doesn't have anything to do (well, she does carry her own luggage, and she takes the occasional picnic).5. How do we protect a once-Queen, now hugely important Senator?  No problem.  We'll assign a lone, ready-to-freak, not-quite-yet Jedi Knight to escort her (wouldn't want an additional armed escort to interfere with the wooden--rotten to the core--love story).4. Who's that powerful dark-side-of-the-force guy?  The name's Dooku, and don't you forget it.  Repeat three times--Dooku, Dooku, Dooku--and you'll know the dark side too.3. How good is that powerful dark-side-of-the-force guy?  Remember how Darth Vader knew when Luke was entering the edge of the same galaxy.  This Dooku guy can't sense six Jedi Knights sneaking up on him from the very next room.2. How do those wonderful, million-star-system-protecting Jedi Knights test their new recruits?  All moms must stay in slave purgatory, unvisited (no phone calls allowed!!), until they die. 1. How to bed that bored, once-Queen, now hugely important Senator?  Put up with kisses slightly better than Pinocchio's, followed by no-sex muddy rationalizations.  Go completely off your rocker, light-sabering the heads off all women and children in a close-by village.  Apologize by claiming that god-like powers will be yours.  If she rips her shirt up to show off her abs, she's yours!",2,0,0,18 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," story changes better than lacks
","There are a couple hard to understand failures with this movie.  No Elven music in Rivendell or Lothlorien?  The movie needed some, as the last 1.5 h are quite gloomy with no break.  JRR, I am certain, would not have approved! And no gifts from Galadriel except for Frodo at the parting?  Perhaps this will be corrected in the later movies (they better be!).But there are wonderful story twists.  The change for Arwen is definitely all for the better!  And I very much liked the change with the breaking of the fellowship:  more favorable for Aragorn, and combined with the changes with Arwen, make his character fuller and better defined.  The movie is so good that even with a couple flaws I rate it one of the best movies I have ever seen.",7,0,0,23 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Hugely disappointing!!
","I had some real concerns during the last half of The Fellowship of the Rings about how unrelentingly gruesome, dark, and finally tortuous the movie was. Jackson never gave us a break. Think about it: we go through Moria with Gandalf's apparent death; there's no joy in Lothlorien; and then the agonizing-to-watch death of Boromir. In the book, Tolkien had us (and the characters) relax and wonder in Lothlorien.  Then following the breakup of the fellowship, he gave us this funny scene with Sam swimming after Frodo, who'd just taken off in the canoe, even though they both knew he couldn't swim. It was a place to laugh with them at the great friendship they had. Did Jackson give Tolkien his due, as one of the greatest storywriters of all time? Would he simply use common sense, and know that the audience needed something cheerful to leave the movie with. No!! He gives us a slow-motion near-death experience with Samwise. Yuck!! So my worries kept coming back at me all year.Even so, with spectacular special effects in Moria, and some great story adjustments (with Aragorn, in particular), I was very happy overall with The Fellowship of the Ring. Unfortunately, The Two Towers shows Jackson at his worst. Not only is this movie unrelenting in being dark in appearance and in tone (Gimli provides a few--far too few--upbeat moments), but now the story 'adjustments' are way out in left field, and terribly done. As a huge Tolkien fan, I won't be able to forgive Jackson with this movie. I give the movie only 5/10; as a Tolkien fan, I can say that it is only just bearable to watch. Gollum was truly terrible. Comparisons to the BBC radio production-- Gollum is incredibly well done--leave us wondering how Andy Serkis could have landed the role in this movie.  There is very little range in his voice. The animation, perhaps predictably (can anyone say Jar Jar Binks?), does not help at all. The primary problem, as with the movie overall, is the nearly complete lack of humor in Gollum's characterization; he comes off as completely unlikable-I find it hard to believe that anyone could even feel pity for him.  Jackson seems intent on making everything as gloomy and downcast as possible.  Very slow pacing doesn't help. SPOILERS In the first movie, Ian McKellen was incredibly strong in his performance as Gandalf. Here he gets very little to work with, and Bernard Hill as Theoden is a miserable substitute. Hill's completely unnoteworthy performance was given no help with the screenplay. Theoden is written in as a very weak character, hardly a King to admire or care for.  For some reason, Jackson decided all the other main characters should show weakness as well.  Aragorn is weak, not as a warrior, but in his relationship with Arwen. In the first movie, this was somewhat acceptable as an excuse Jackson invented to explain why Aragorn had not assumed his heritage as the true king.  Aragorn's weakness there also helped in contrasting the strength of Arwen, a very nice update from Tolkien.  But in the Two Tower's, Jackson destroys all with Arwen losing faith in her own decisions and love.  So much that was positive in the first movie was destroyed here. Dada says go to the Grey Havens, being mortal will be too tough for you, and off she goes! > Faramir?!?! What the heck did Jackson think he was doing here. This whole part of the movie takes a complete departure from Tolkien. One of the main points of Tolkien's Faramir was to show that the wizard in Gandalf and the Numenor in Aragorn still existed in the men of Gondor. Faramir was a promise that although many good things might fade away, perhaps even better things can come through to the future. The depiction of Faramir in the Two Towers was a final nail in the coffin for me. If my family had not been with me, I might have gotten up and left the theater at that point. These fatal flaws in the screenplay were only compounded by some true silliness in the action.  The powerful Nazgul has a mighty flying stead (dragon-thing?) that is cowed by a single arrow, and apparently just flies away!  Please!!!  Mr. Jackson, I've read Tolkien, I _know_ Tolkien, and trust me, you are NO Tolkien!!!!  Cut the super-crappy story changes!!!!!!! Jez, I really gotta calm down... The only part of the movie that I thought was reasonably well done was Treebeard. His voice and animation were very good. But did Jackson slow down and give us a moment with Treebeard in his cave serving the Ent water to Merry and Pippin? No. That might have broken the dark, somber, unrelenting tone of the movie. And was Jackson satisfied with how Tolkein did the Entmoot and the finale at Helm's Deep? No. For no reason at all, he changed both, to the very huge detriment of his movie (it sure as heck is no longer Tolkien's in any way, shape or form!). The point of the Ents and Helm's Deep was to show us that men were not strong enough to defeat Saruman, much less Sauron.  After Helm's Deep, we _knew_ that Gondor would have no chance against Sauron; only Frodo could save the day. Instead, Jackson wants us to believe that if Gandalf can ride out and gather up a few hundred men, anything can happen (what the hey, Aragorn, Theoden, and a couple other riders can simply ride out through the gates and brush thousands of Orcs right off the battlements like a knife through butter!). Oh well. This particular fan will stay faithful to Tolkien. Jackson is no longer in that realm, and should not be forgiven. How depressing...",1,0,0,18 December 2002
The Big Blue," Pointless and Depressing
","OK, OK.  I sent in the following comment just after seeing this movie for the first time:'The summary [Stupid, Pointless, Terrible] pretty much says it all. Save yourself 2.5h of boring, hard-to-watch stupid movie. Perhaps the only conclusion about this movie is that accidents involving parents during childhood can really, really mess someone up.'I admit that I was upset, and not just a little bit.  After some relaxing and thinking, the above needs some elaboration to be useful to anyone that has not yet seen this movie.First, this could have been a very good movie; it comes close in a lot of areas, especially in the cinematography.  The Greek locations are spectacular.  But I have to say that the underwater shots left me unimpressed.**SPOILERS** More importantly, this movie _seems_ to be a movie about love:  the lead male (Jacques Mayol) is conflicted between his love of the ocean, love of his 'family' of dolphins, and love of his human partner, Johanna. 
This is where I just don't get this movie, and the almost overwhelmingly positive response to it at IMDB.  Mayol is in many respects a classic male lead:  he reminds me of Clint Eastwood in many of his westerns, and as Dirty Harry.  Does Clint portray a loving male role model in these movies?  Not in my book, and Mayol misses even more so in this movie.  Mayol doesn't communicate with anyone in a reasonable fashion, except, it seems, his dolphins.  My initial response to his adult character is that he's just a really messed up individual that never got over the abandonment of his mother and the death of his father, who was a diver for his living.Nothing I saw in the movie leads me to believe otherwise about Mayol.  One wonders why Johanna would possible stay with this guy.  He and she never have anything more than extremely tense, completely dysfunctional interactions.  Johanna tries to get him to interact with her, but other than sex, absolutely nothing happens that one could view as positive in any way. Mayol has sex with her, tells her he _thinks_ he's in love with her, and then takes off and spends the rest of the night swimming in the ocean with his dolphin friends (lovers?).  A lot is made about the 'friendship' between Mayol and his boyhood bully Enzo.  Forget it; Enzo tries his best to be friends with Mayol in their adult life, but again Mayol seems completely disinterested in this other form of human contact.  Enzo and Mayol compete in free diving, but Mayol clearly just doesn't care about the competitions, taking any real interest away from this part of the movie.Mayol is just flat nuts in the head, and the end of the movie proves that he is more seriously suicidal that Enzo.  Enzo dies trying to prove he is the best; Mayol dives away from the love and family that is offered to him with Johanna.  So my anger has to do with watching such a destructive, unhappy, dysfunctional individual not only mess his own life up, but also that of the people that need and love him.  There's some weird talk in the movie about the call of the deep blue, and mermaids that await males in the depths of the ocean 'if their love is true.'  What a load of baloney!  It would work if the movie went toward showing how Mayol was psychologically damaged by his father's death, and how Johanna (and Enzo's death) help bring him back to humanity.  But the movie goes in just the opposite direction.I found this movie utterly depressing and pointless.  It's clear a lot of other people saw something else in it.  Even as a fairytale--Mayol swims away to live as a weird human/dolphin--the movie just doesn't work.  He leaves a wife and unborn child for no justifiable reason.I finally gave the movie a 4 of 10 rating, only for the cinematography.  If you like weepy love stories, there have to be many better movies out there! This one just makes no sense at all.",5,25,51,27 August 2002
The Big Blue," Stupid, pointless, terrible
","The summary pretty much says it all.  Save yourself 2.5h of boring, hard-to-watch stupid movie.  Perhaps the only conclusion about this movie is that accidents involving parents during childhood can really, really mess someone up.",5,7,20,24 August 2002
Signs," A very odd story
","Just saw this on DVD, and wonder about the high rating it's received on IMDB.  Great acting helped very much with this slow moving piece.  But the scares are non-existent, so there really was not much build up in suspense; OK, maybe a bit with the basement scene, but with the slow pacing of the movie, it seemed to take forever to get there.  The story has some very odd twists that in the end just don't work.The most interesting parts of the movie were the religious conclusions.  I didn't expect a religious theme in this movie, and am always pleased when Hollywood chooses to deal straightforwardly with such difficult topics. Introducing aliens and combining a large series of weird character traits and actions are very odd--and certainly not straightforward--ways to surmise that 'God exists.'  I'm still not 100% certain what to think, and perhaps that's a good thing to say about a movie like Signs.  Even so, the movie mainly leaves you with that uncomfortable feeling that it could have been a lot better.",6,0,1,27 January 2003
