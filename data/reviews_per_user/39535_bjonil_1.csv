Requiem for a Dream," A true masterpiece - perfect, nothing less
","This film is just - perfect - story, the actors, the superb use of the music and of course the cinematography which is in a class of its own all mix up to a true piece of artwork which I cant recall I ever seen combine in such perfection - ever. You get hooked on from the very start and you cant let go until several days after you've seen it. I loved every minute of it - saw it 3 times in a week ( once with Director Darren Aronofsy commentary ) and I am just completely enchanted by it. Go see it now!",10,0,0,3 September 2001
