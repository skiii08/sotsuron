Skyfall," Number one is Casino Royale
","I am a very big fan of Bond films and particularly of Mr. Craig. I still believe the best Bond was Mr Connery but Craig is the best in nowadays. Still, I was very disappointed with Skyfall as in my opinion it is the worst Bond movie since Craig came! Even QofS was much better. So the resume is simple, Skyfall starts nice with Istanbul and Shanghai, Mr. Bardem is prefect, but then it somehow turns into Home Alone in Scotland (WTF)! I hope this movie was just a preparation for the next movies to come. If not, I think it is the end of the franchise! The job done by Craig was not very impressive, Dench was poor, but Bardem saved it all. I would like to know where all the money for production went? I could not see it spent for the movie!",3,13,27,10 November 2012
