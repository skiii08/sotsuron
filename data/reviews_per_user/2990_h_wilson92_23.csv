The Longest Yard," Very funny movie!
",I saw this movie last night for the first time and I was laughing my head off from the beginning to the end.IThis movie has a lot of gags and I had to run to the toilet cos I wet myself with laughter and i had to gasp for air cos i was laughing so hard.From reading the negative reviews on this site - I don't know why people hate this movie? it is so funny! it was one of my favorite movies starring Adam Sandler.I thought the best performances were from Sandler and Rock. This movie is really good but I really like the original movie better.I thought this remake was a lot more funnier than the original.If you love Adam Sandler and Chris Rock then you will love this movie.Def the most funniest movie I have seen in 2010.I also really liked the soundtrack 10/10 for a great comedy movie,10,1,3,19 January 2010
The Hangover," so funny! the comedy of 2009!
",'The Hangover' is by far the funniest movie of 2009.A person took me to the movies for my birthday last year and she suggested Hannah Montana - I was like no way see 'The Hangover'.I I had to see this movie when i saw the trailer.The whole audience cried so hard with laughter when i went to see it at the cinema All the main characters were excellent in this movie and my favorite character is Alan Garner played by Zach.I think I laughed the hardest with all the scenes he was in it.II laugh so hard I cry every time I watch this movie and I have seen it many times.It is very funny from the beginning to the end.It is definitely crude.It has a lot of random one liners.No matter how many times I will watch this movie it is never going to get old.One of the most funniest movies I have ever seen.A must see comedy.Is looking forward to 'The Hangover 2' which I wonder will it top the 'The Hangover 1'? No wonder why this is the best selling comedy DVD of all time.Definitely one of my most favorite comedy movies.10/10 is my rating,10,1,2,8 December 2010
Iron Man 2," Great sequel!
","I really enjoyed the first Iron Man movie and was looking forward to the 2nd movie when I heard that 'Iron Man 2' was coming out I knew I would have to see this one.I saw it today and initially I was worried that it wouldn't be as good as the first one but personally I thought it was better than the first one.In my opinion I think this is the best superhero movie of 2010 and also one of the best movies of 2010.It was well worth the $15.50 I paid for the movie admission.It had a great soundtrack,fantastic cast,great plot,amazing graphics,excellent director.It was very well balanced to make a great movie.It also was funny in some scenes.It was great from the beginning to the end.I recommend this movie to all.I am already looking forward to Iron Man 3.The best Marvel movie I have seen in a while.10/10 is my rating.",10,3,11,2 May 2010
Cloverfield," Surpassed all of my expectations!
","After seeing all of the trailers on the TV and hearing from word to mouth how good it was from all of the people I talked to about this movie.I decided to go and see this movie for all the fuss.The first twenty minutes started off well and then when it started to get intense I was so tense , I was on the edge of my chair in the cinema and so was everyone else.I think everyone gasped at the most intense scenes.I enjoyed this movie so much I went and saw it for the last 3 days of the week.I think this movie was very underrated and deserved a lot more hype.This is an incredible movie - the plot,action and graphics.I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves sci fi action movies.10/10 is my rating",10,1,4,5 January 2010
Megamind," Really funny!
",I thought that Megamind wasn't going to be a good movie but I was wrong.It was a lot better than I thought.It had several actors in it that I really like.Megamind (played by Will Ferrell)is a really funny character who is the movies villain and despite everything he does he cannot get anywhere.My favorite characters are Metro Man and Megamind.It was a really funny movie and is well worth the money to see it in 3D.The 3D effects are great.It has a great soundtrack.I am going to see this in 2D next time I go to the movies.I want a second serving.Best animated movie of 2010.It had a great plot with a mix of comedy and action.9/10 is my rating,9,1,2,15 December 2010
Blades of Glory," So funny !!!!!
","When I first saw the trailer for this movie - i thought that it was really funny for words and wanted to see it badly.The poster for the film is the funniest I have ever seen.I always laugh when I see this poster.When i went to see the movie at the cinema - the movie lived up to my expectations.I laughed very hard throughout the movie and I almost wet my pants.A lot of people in the cinema laughed so hard that they did exactly the same.It was very funny and the clothes they wore were hilarious.Also the plot,quotes and characters were hilarious. Some of the funniest scenes were at the icing rink and the scene where the head was chopped off by theice skating rink.The two main characters Chazz and Jimmy got off to arough start in the beginning but became friends like brothers after some teamwork Some of the scenes may be unsuitable for little kids butI thought it was a very good comedy movie.I have seen this movie 5times and hail this as my all time favorite movie.It is also in my opinion Will Ferrells best comedy.",10,2,4,23 November 2008
Step Up 2: The Streets," Disappointed
",I went to see Step Up 2 cos there was no movies I wanted to see and I thought it was really interesting! wrong! the acting was terrible and so were the actors apart from Channing Tatum who is a great actor.I didn't really like the soundtrack too.I didn't even know that it was a movie with urban music.It is definitely one of the worst movies of 2008 and one of the top 5 worst movies I have seen in my life.I personally thought that the movie was bland and was actually better than the first Step Up movie which I saw the other day and was very bland.I would give Step Up = Plot 2/10 acting 1/10 music 1/10 overall 1/10.,1,2,3,27 February 2009
The Commitments," Really boring!
",I didn't like this movie at all! I had to do it as a film study two years ago.We couldn't pick this movie so the teacher did.Everyone hated it and I could see why.The only good bits were the swearing which was used a 1000 times.The swearing bits were pretty funny but other than that it was a poor movie.I didn't really like the characters cos they were all poor coming together to join a band.Some songs were good such as the guy that sung Mustang Sally. The friendship was bad cos they treated each other like crap. 2 stars is too high for this bad movie.I don't understand how people love this movie!,2,6,32,26 January 2009
The Love Guru," Why all the hate?
","From reading many of these negative reviews on this website about The Love Guru starring Mike Myers,Jessica Alba and Justin Timberlake. I decided to watch this movie and I did last night with my family.We all loved it! I was laughing in many of the scenes.I know that many people didn't love this movie and it didn't do very well at the box office and that is considered one of the worst movies of all time but I really enjoyed it anyway despite what people thought of it and that it was a box office bomb.It wasn't the best comedy movie of all time but it was a really good movie.Also not the best Mike Myers movie of all time but it was one of his good ones.I really liked the music and characters and plot 9/10 is my rating If you love Mike Myers then you have got to see this movie.",9,2,6,20 January 2010
Mamma Mia!," Good musical
","There are not many musicals I like but this has to be one of the few ones I did enjoy.I was even recommended this movie from a couple of my friends who had seen it.After all it has been a massive success cos of ABBA and the actors.I liked this movie cos it had nice scenery,wonderful acting and a good soundtrack even though I am not an ABBA fan. I thought this movie was really funny and very happy.I did not know that Pierce Brosnan did musicals and could sing until viewing this movie ! The actors were good singers but not the best.They all had fun acting and singing.It was a good laugh all throughout the movie.I have only seen this movie once but really enjoyed it.If you like any of the actors featured in Mamma Mia! or like Abba then watch this movie 8/10 stars is my rating",10,2,5,6 April 2009
Twilight," Loved this movie!
","I don't get why people are hating on this movie - I thought it was so awesome! Everyone told me that has seen this movie that it is really good before they saw it and I wasn't really interested in it at first but there was a DVD lying around and i decided to watch it one night because there was nothing on and I was like 'this is a very cool movie' after I saw it.I really liked the plot,music and characters especially Bella (played by Kirsten Stewart) Edward (played by Robert Pattinson) and Jacob (played by Taylor Lautner).I didn't understand why people were fussing over this movie so much until i finished watching this movie and I can see why it is so popular.I have seen this movie at least 10 times and It never gets old or boring.It had a lot of action and suspense.Another great thing about this movie is that there is no profanity in it 10/10 for this movie",10,5,10,9 August 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Better than the first movie
","I am a fan of the first Twilight movie and I was worried that it wouldn't be as good as the first one as many movies aren't as good as the first one but I was wrong. This movie is really better than Twilight and everyone that is a fan of Twilight that has seen this movie says it is way better than the first one.I loved the actors and their acting,the plot, the soundtrack and everything about this movie.I thought it had more suspense and violent than the first one.It is one of the best vampire movies I have ever seen and if you like vampires then you will love this movie.I still have no idea why people hate the Twilight Saga but with every movie out there they are entitled to their own opinions.I thought they could have put this movie into 2 movies like New Moon part 1 and 2 but it is amazing that they put 600 pages of a novel into a 2 and so hours of film.10/10 for this movie",10,1,7,9 August 2010
Saw II," One of the best sequels - better than SAW 1
","I really liked the first SAW movie and decided to rent out the 2nd on DVD.I wasn't disappointed with the sequel at all.I liked this movie better than SAW 1.In fact it is one of the best sequels ever made.This movie was much more scarier,violent,brutal and gorier than the first one ( I'm very sure that they are going to get more violent by each one). It had some many memorable scenes such as the pit of syringes and a helmet that slams shut around someone's head.It is one of the most interesting and original horror movies ever made.It is very intense throughout the movie.I am already looking forward to seeing SAW III when I get the chance to see it.The acting was really good and had improved from the first movie vastly.",10,1,2,15 August 2010
The Dark Knight," Amazing movie - one of the best of 2008
","I didn't really like Batman Begins and was worried about the hype that surrounded 'The Dark Knight'. A lot of people that I knew said that TDK was the best movie they have ever seen and I didn't believe it until I saw the movie.I was really amazed by this movie - it had amazing special effects, amazing plot with many twists, amazing cast (especially Christian Bale and the late Heath Ledger) and the whole movie in general was absolutely incredible.I loved every minute of it.I really do believe that Heath Ledger deserved the Oscar for his performance in TDK.I am really disappointed that this movie didn't get nominated for Best Picture as it was the best of 2008 without a doubt.It is way way better than Batman Begins and I absolutely LOVE TDK.I recommend this movie to all people that love superhero movies.one of the best movies of the 2000 - 2009 decade 10/10 amazing movie.",10,1,5,13 May 2010
Avatar," Amazing Piece of Art
","One of the most amazing movies I have ever seen in my life.Before I went and saw Avatar I asked people what they thought about it and they said' the plot wasn't very good but the imagery is out of this world.You will love this movie'.I went and saw this movie at the movies and I was so amazed by the imagery that I was so speechless.I forgot about every problem I had for the almost 3 hours I spent in the theater and I couldn't get many of the images out of my mind for weeks.Avatar is truly James Cameron's magnum opus.It is without the doubt best movie that he has directed.I cannot have a word to describe this movie but I will put it into 2 words 'Absolutely Incredible'.This is the most stunning piece of work I have seen in a movie.Although the plot was not great, the movies images made up for the plot by a huge mile.The greatest 3D movie ever.I am not surprised this movie has grossed 2.7 billion at the box office.This is a movie you have to see at the cinema.10/10 for a genius movie.",10,3,5,13 May 2010
Saw," One of my favorite movies
",I have heard about this movie from a lot of people who really enjoyed it so I did watch it at 3am one morning in pitch black and I really enjoyed it.I had heard of it before and had planned to watch it but didn't get around to it for a long time.It had a lot of very good twists and a very good plot.I think the director did such a good job of this movie.It also scared me because it is one of the most violent I have seen.I think it is underestimated cos I know several people who despised it but I did not see why.I have seen all the 5 Saw movies I thought it was so good I bought it on DVD and have watched it half a dozen times.It is definitely my favorite Saw movie out of the five. 10/10 stars is my rating,10,0,1,27 May 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Terrible Terrible
",I was really looking forward to 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' as I really liked the first one and I was so excited for the day it came out.I went into the theater with high expectations and throughout the 2.5 hours watching this I was super disappointed! I believe this is the most successful worst movie ever made.I wondered when it was going to end! It was far too long! The only good actor in the movie was Josh Duhamel.It had far too many explosions and terrible terrible dialog.I noticed that almost every person in the feature was a guy and I guess that was cos of Megan Fox.It has everything to offer about American culture.I want back my 2.5 hours watching this and $10 i spent watching this movie.My brother thought this was great and his friends did too but I disagree with them.I agree with the 80% of critics that hated this movie.1/10 is my rating,1,5,16,8 December 2010
Inception," Excellent Excellent movie!
","In my opinion this movie is the best Christopher Nolan has directed - This movie is better than The Dark Knight in my opinion.I didn't think that any movie that Nolan would direct after The Dark Knight would get any better but it outshone it by 20 times.When I went to see this movie I definitely wasn't disappointed with it.Nolan is one of the best directors ever. I do believe without a doubt this is Nolan's masterpiece and any future movie from Nolan will be very difficult to do better than this one.It reminded me of the Matrix but much better with a mix of James Bond.It is very hard to understand unless you pay very close attention to the movie(It is very hard to describe what this movie is about), the plot was very good and had a very good concept,Leonardo DiCaprio had an amazing performance which is very worthy of Best Actor Academy Award and everyone else in the movie did almost as well.The soundtrack in the movie was breathtaking.It kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what is going to happen next.It was interesting and imaginative.The movie did very well in every part and has all the elements required to earn Best Picture at the 2011 Academy Awards and other awards, I think that not only is this the best movie of 2010 it is probably the best movie of the 2010 decade.If you haven't seen this movie yet you MUST see it.It is well worth the money.10/10 is my rating",10,2,6,17 August 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Absolutely Brilliant!
",Wihthout a doubt this is one of my all time favorite movies and is probably the best Stephen King film.I had never heard of it until i saw the IMDb top 250.Better than The Godfather.I'm super glad this is #1 on the top 250.It has an amazing plot and is a movie that sends a lot of messages one being that institutionalization has a huge effect on people that are in prison for many years and they get used to it.When they leave they want to go back to the prison as it is their home. It is a shame it didn't win any awards at the Academy Awards.If I were on the panel deciding what movie should win Best Picture Oscar I would have picked The Shawshank Redemption which would have been a hard task as 2 other masterpieces Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction were also in the nominees.1994 must have been a really outstanding year in film.I wish I could give it 11 stars.This is a movie you have to see.It truly is a film that is for watching dozens of times and is a beauty all the time10/10,10,0,1,30 August 2010
Sin City," Fantastic Movie!
",I saw this movie a few months ago and I was blown away by this movie.I am not into black and white movies but this one I got into.This movie has a lot of violence from finish to end and I think it deserved to be rated NC-17.If you don't like graphic violence then don't watch this movie.Everyone was really good in this movie and the best performances from this movie are Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen.Sin city is a fantastic movie with a fantastic plot that leaves you on the seat tense.Anyone who is a fan of the comic books for this movie will love this one as it is based on the comic book.This movie is well crafted and cleverly done.This is one of my favorite movies.Rating 10/10,10,2,4,3 January 2010
Coach Carter," Very moving movie
","Not a fan of sports movies but I really really liked this movie.This movie is about an amazing basketball coach who puts his team before him to make them successful with honor,commitment and discipline.This helped Carter's team succeed. I actually thought it was the best movie of 2005 that I saw.It was an amazing drama movie with some violence.I think that any basketball team that is struggling should watch this movie as it helped turn a struggling team into a success story.It was definitely the best sports movie I have ever seen.The plot and acting get 10 stars from me.If you haven't seen this movie and like sports movies watch this one! 10/10 overall",10,0,0,27 February 2009
The Breakfast Club," A Classic!
","Really loved this movie.It really did portray high school in the right ways which had 5 different people from 5 different stereotypes - Princess,Criminal,Geek,Outcast and Criminal which are all stereotypes found at all high schools.These 5 stereotypes joined together to know each other and they never realized that they had a lot in common because they had to sit through detention on a Saturday from 7 - 4 pm, This movie is a movie which I would watch many times because it was funny and was a real high school movie aimed at teenagers.Back in the 80s and 70s movies set in high schools draw hordes of teenagers to view these movies but nowadays with movies such as the HSM franchise they are set at 7 - 12 year old crowd.This movie had style,attitude and a good soundtrack.There is a lot of swearing in the movie and it is a very good comedy.Get it out from the local DVD store cos it is a MUST SEE!",9,0,1,10 December 2008
Semi-Pro," Funny film
","I didn't think this movie was as funny as the other Ferrell movies around such as Blades Of Glory,Tallageda Nights and Elf.I went and saw it the day it came in the theaters I did crack up laughing the minute that Will Ferrell sang at the beginning of the movie.It had a lot of coarse language and heaps of sex and sports.I did laugh in some areas but I didn't laugh in some areas.I didn't see how people cannot like this movie.It had good songs,comedy,a plot and characters.I gave this 8 stars cos I really liked it.9 or 10 stars is too high for an average movie I liked.I especially enjoyed the raunchy scenes in the movie the most.It is a good movie but I wouldn't hail it as one of the best Will Ferrell movies.",10,1,1,25 January 2009
