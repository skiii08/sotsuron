Insidious: Chapter 2," Almost as Good as The First One
","I recently saw Insidious: Chapter Two because I didn't just love the first one, it's probably one of my all time favorite horror films even if I don't find it scary. So there's no doubt I would enjoy the second installment in the Insidious series.The story was almost as shocking and nerve wrenching as the first one and can actually be shocking at times. For example, they explain some of the occurrences that happened in the first film that you didn't know were supposed to be explained. My only criticism of the story is that there was such a strong build up, but a bit of a disappointing climax.The atmosphere was just as eerie and creepy as the first one. (The Further is still creepy as hell) The acting is pretty decent, but the film also does suffer from some of the same issues that the first one did. It was all jump scares. I remember when I was younger, I thought the first film was the scariest movie ever. But now that I'm older and I analyze a bit more, there's really only jump scares which get old after a while.Insidious: Chapter Two is almost as good as the first one, but not quite. Is it a good sequel? Yes. Do I recommend you see it? Yes. It's a good horror flick that's worth at least a watch or two.",5,1,2,24 March 2014
It," Not Bad. Not Bad at All
","Unpopular opinion that will likely result in you guys sicking your dogs on me: I don't like the original It mini-series. I honestly don't. Do I hate it? No. I think the child actors did an okay job for what they're given and there are a couple decent scares here and there, but maybe it's just me, but I found it damn near impossible to take seriously. Most of the scares just bordered on unintentional comedy for me (I still find myself cracking up at the 'Kiss me, Fatboy' line) and here's another unpopular opinion that will likely result in me getting killed or maimed: I didn't like Tim Curry's Pennywise. Don't get me wrong, I like Tim Curry, but he came off as more funny than he did scary or intimidating which probably isn't a good sign if you're doing a balls-to-the- wall horror film. Maybe the film was terrifying at the time it came out, but nowadays it's just really corny and dated. I don't think it holds up nearly as well as people say it does. But enough bashing of the original. How does the new film hold up?Honestly, I think it's a marked improvement. That's not to say it doesn't have its flaws because it does. Its biggest issue is that it can be over-reliant on jump scares at times and I can't help but feel that was because the studio felt the need to try to appeal to basic movie-goers who consider a horror film sucky if it doesn't make them jump out of their seat at least once or twice. But to be fair, most of the jump scares are at least being used to utilize something we as the audience are supposed to be afraid of and they do manage to stir in a few clever and ballsy scares in there too. Hell, there's one scare in the first five minutes of the film that I'm surprised they even attempted. I won't spoil it for you, but it's pretty shocking to say the least. So I guess you can say, it appeals to both audiences in a way. It definitely feels a lot more like a horror film than the original did.Most of the performances were pretty good for the most part. Most the child actors did a pretty good job, the two best probably being Bev and the kid from Stranger Things. The only performance that didn't really work was the kid playing Stan. His performance was pretty iffy and I didn't really buy it at all. But good child acting is a rarity, so it is a pretty impressive feat that only one of the actors isn't very good as opposed to all of them. The kids themselves had pretty good chemistry as well and I had no problem believing the legitimacy of their friendship. But the scene stealer by far is Bill Skaarsgaard as Pennywise. Sure, he could be funny at times, but not once did I ever forget that he was also supposed to be scary and a legitimate threat. He managed to find a good balance unlike Tim Curry whose performance was so over-the-top, that I forgot that he was even supposed to be threatening.Some of the side characters were a little underdeveloped, but they at least had a lot more character in this film than they did in the mini-series. Henry Bowers was a little more than just a generic bully and Mike was more than just the token black kid who shows up randomly near the end of Part 1. They could be developed a lot more, sure, but there's at least SOME character there.So all in all, while I don't think it's anywhere close to being one of the best Stephen King movies, it's still an enjoyable film. It's creepy, it's funny, it's energetic, and it's effective. I see myself watching this version again a lot more than I do the Tim Curry version. From what I understand, they're making a second film about the adulthood portion. While even fans of the book and mini-series seem to agree that the adulthood portions aren't that great, I am curious to see how these filmmakers pull it off. They surprised me with this film, didn't they? So you bet, I'll be back for the sequel.",7,2,10,8 September 2017
Suicide Squad," The Most Disappointing Film of 2016 I've Seen So Far
","So, I still kept an open mind going into the theater despite the negative reviews that this film received, but I'm sorry. I can't lie to you guys or myself. This movie just wasn't that good.The plot jumped around so much that certain events in the story came off as very rushed and sloppy, most of the characters were incredibly paper thin and underutilized and were incredibly lacking in terms of chemistry, the action wasn't really anything to write home about, and the main villain I found really hard to take seriously due to both an awkward performance by Cara Delivingne and the fact that she spends most of the climax looking like a freaking luau dancer.Now it does have its pros. Like Margot Robbie was really great as Harley Quinn and Viola Davis was really great as Amanda Waller. And most of the humor, while it never had me rolling on the floor laughing, did get a few chuckles out of me. I also appreciate that it focused more on practical effects rather than overloading on computer generated effects. (The action like I said wasn't great, but I was at least able to tell what was going on during the fight scenes, unlike a previous DC film that comes to mind.) But the film's highlight was the first third, hands down, because it both established, what I thought was going to be its style, and introduced the characters wonderfully. I had pretty high hopes during that first act and I'm really ashamed that the rest of the film was just so...blah.So yeah. I was pretty disappointed by this one. Although, I couldn't help but feel that a lot of the film was cut for time given how the film jumped around so much and how the Joker had such a minimal role despite the fact that he was practically the unofficial spokesperson for most of the marketing. If they ever release a director's cut, I'd be willing to see it. But until or if that ever happens, Suicide Squad currently stands as a very uneven and mediocre flick that could've been so much more. It's by no means the worst film I've seen this year, but it is definitely the most underwhelming.4/10",4,2,4,1 November 2016
Pacific Rim," A Lot Better Than I Thought It Was Going To Be
","I remember entering the movie theater not expecting much and leaving the movie theater completely impressed. I wasn't expecting this movie to be bad, but I didn't expect it to be that great either.As we all know, the idea of humans piloting robots to fight monsters is nothing new. It's been used in several other movies, TV shows, and video games. However, this film took it to the next level with its engaging storyline, gripping action, and stellar special effects.While there are pros to this movie, there's bound to be some cons too. I didn't think the acting was that great, quite a few of the characters weren't very likable, and the writing was a bit hammy at times.But the pros outdo the cons because I still enjoyed this film. If you love science fiction and/or monster movies, then give this flick a watch.",7,1,2,19 March 2014
The Lego Movie," Surprisingly One of the Best Animated Films I've Ever Seen
","When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I face palmed and said, 'Okay. Hollywood has lost it. They've officially run out of ideas and just picked some random toy-line to make some stupid movie off of.' So as you may imagine, I avoided this film for a while. But after hearing all the good things about it and learning that even the pickiest movie critics liked it, I decided to head to the theater and see the highly anticipated Lego Movie. And I'm glad I did.First, the story was original and is probably one of the best story lines I've seen in a kid's film. The characters were memorable (Morgan Freeman's character was just hilarious and Will Arnette as Batman was classic). The humor was clever and well thought out and the animation kinda screwed with your mind. You couldn't tell if it was computer animated or stop motion. And what really surprised me, was that near the end of the movie, there's something that actually symbolizes the main protagonist and the main antagonist. And let me tell you, I didn't expect to find symbolism in a film called, The Lego Movie. This is surprisingly one of the best animated films I've ever seen. The only things I didn't like about it was the rushed ending and the overuse of the Everything is Awesome song. (I swear if I hear that song one more time, I'm gonna saw off my own ears) But both of those criticisms are blown away by this fun filled action packed adventure. Even if you never played with Legos as a kid, this is still an enjoyable film. Hell, it's enjoyable for both kids and adults. Do I recommend that you see this movie? Absolutely. Be ready to have one of the most fun experiences you've ever had at the movies.",9,1,4,23 March 2014
Non-Stop," A Decent Thriller
","I recently saw 'Non-Stop' a couple of days ago and I personally enjoyed it. It's not just a copy and paste of 'Taken' like some people seem to believe. It was unique, creative, and a good deal of fun. But is it as good as other movie thrillers? No, but that's not really a bad thing. It may not be as suspenseful as other great thrillers like 'Perfect Blue' or 'Rear Window' but it is just as entertaining. 'Non-Stop' had a few pretty silly moments and it did drag on a little longer than it really needed to, but it still did its best to keep from losing focus and keep the audience entertained. Is it an absolutely amazing movie? No. Is it a well done movie? Yes. Is it Oscar worthy? No and I don't think it's really meant to be. It's a decent thriller film that does prove to be a great time at the movies. The story is good, the action is good, most of the characters are forgettable but likable, and Liam Neeson is, well, Liam Neeson. It's just a fun movie to watch and I think it's worth at least one viewing.",7,3,6,27 March 2014
I Am Legend," Not the Best But Certainly Not the Worst
","Post apocalyptic movies have been around forever. Some hit and some miss. The film I Am Legend does a little bit of both. So, the film revolves around a scientist and his dog, as they are the only survivors of a deadly plague that has ravaged humanity. During his time alone, the scientist searches desperately to search for a cure. But the question is, is he really alone in this world gone to hell? The good: This film has a basic, but overall decent storyline. I enjoyed a good majority of the characters, and while I didn't think the actual death of the dog was sad I actually thought the way it affected Will Smith's character was sad. The special effects were pretty good, it had a decent score, and am I the only one who just loves the monsters? I don't know. Maybe I'm just a sucker for that kind of stuff.The bad: While the first half was good, the second half is where I thought the film started to slide a little bit. After the dog is infected by the zombie-like monster things (I don't know, they never make it clear) Will Smith tries to seek revenge. However, it goes horribly wrong, but he ends up being rescued by a young woman and her son. Now, the woman and her son are not bad characters. They just seemed kind of out of place to me. I don't why it's just something about them that drives me a little nuts. Maybe it's because I wish the rest of the movie just revolved around the scientist without the aid of his trusty canine friend. I actually think that would've been a little more interesting if it was done right. But I guess I'll just take it for what it is. And for what it is, it doesn't really harm the movie. The length of the film is the other bad thing, but there's not a lot I can say about that.Overall, I like this film. Is it the best post apocalyptic film? No, but it's certainly not the worst.",6,2,3,8 May 2014
The Dark Knight," I Don't Care What Avengers fans say. This is the best superhero film ever made.
","My god, I love this movie. I love its story, acting, cinematography, etc. The Dark Knight is a sequel to another great superhero film called, Batman Begins, and is one of the very few film sequels that actually surpasses the original. Christopher Nolan's direction is just perfect and Christian Bale's performance is excellent (despite the fact that his Batman voice sounds like he's gargling rocks after being diagnosed with severe throat cancer.) The biggest controversy that this film caused was who they got to play The Joker: Heath Ledger. This received a pretty polarized reaction. People either love or despise his performance. Personally, I was skeptical at first, but was then blown away. Story: 10/10 Performances: 9/10 Stunts: 10/10 Cinematography: 8/10I don't care what fans of the Avengers say. This is the best superhero movies, if not one of the best movies, ever made.",10,0,2,19 March 2014
Sausage Party," Better Than Expected, But Still Not Anything Great
","The trailer for this film broke the internet. For a while, everyone was talking about it and claiming that it was going to be the best comedy of 2016. I wasn't really in the same boat. While I thought the idea of anthropomorphic food items discovering the truth about their existence was a creative idea, I failed to see how well it would carry a feature film and felt like it would've been better off as a short on SNL or some other sketch show. But after seeing it....it was...better than expected. Although that doesn't make the movie amazing by default.Like I said earlier, the concept is pretty creative and they do surprisingly take a few advantages with it. There's some pretty creative ideas buried underneath and they try to work in some satire involving prejudice, immortality, and identity. They obviously don't go very deep in depth, but they do it decently for a film whose protagonist is a talking sausage.But the absolutely biggest flaw with this movie is the fact that it's not really that funny. By far this movie's biggest faults that bogs it down, is its jokes. While they're not necessarily terrible and there were only a few that I actually groaned at, nothing about them were really laugh out loud hilarious or even worth much more than just a small chuckle.While the film kind of fails in terms of comedy, I do at the very least give it props for its creativity. A good chunk of the satire works, it boasts a pretty imaginative concept, and the animation is actually pretty solid (despite the working condition controversy) that actually does add to the subject they're satirizing (Pixar.) So the film overall is just okay as a whole. It isn't great, but it is a lot more creative than it should be.6/10.",6,0,3,1 November 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Fans Love It. Critics Hate It. I'm Kinda In Between.
","So after several times of declaring that this movie is going to be garbage and how it's going to completely kill the relevance of the characters of Batman and Superman, I finally saw it and came to the conclusion that it was...............eh. Not as bad as the Rotten Tomatoes score has you to believe, but not as good as some of the DC fanboys have you believe.Ben Afleck was surprisingly good as Batman, even though the his character was a goddamn psychopath who killed and branded his symbol on the survivors, but I digress. Gal Gadot was good as Wonder Woman, Henry Cavill was alright as Superman, but I have no idea what the hell they were thinking casting Jesse Eisenburg as Lex Luthor. I mean I think he can be a really good actor, but man, he was just so awful in this movie. It seems like he was trying to pull off what Heath Ledger did in the Dark Knight, but it just fails so miserably. Every time he was on screen, everything felt so awkward and uncomfortable. During some of his scenes I actually heard some of the people in the audience groan. Jesse, I love ya, but you really stunk up this performance.The plot, like I expected looking at the trailers, was all over the place. The opening was strong and I was thinking to myself, 'What are the critics talking about? This is awesome.' But that moment of relief was short-lived. One minute we're focusing on the backlash Superman is getting for his actions in Man of Steel, the next we're focusing on Batman hunting a Russian arms dealer, the next we're focusing on Lex Luthor trying to create Doomsday, the next we're focusing on a drive containing information on other superheroes and yada yada yada. I felt like I was watching five movies all crammed into one.Easily the best part of the movie was focusing on Superman dealing with the backlash from the destruction of Metropolis. It felt the most realistic and it's also addressing the biggest flaw a lot of people had with Man of Steel. But it doesn't go anywhere, nor does it change the characters or plot in anyway, so it's overall just pointless. It seemed more concerned with setting up the Justice League than actually telling a coherent story. Like I said earlier, I felt like I was watching multiple movie all crammed into one. Despite all of that, it was actually cool to see heroes like the Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg, and Wonder Woman on the big screen for the first time. So that's a plus.The action was hit and miss. Some action sequences were just constant shaky cam and flashes of lightning and rain every five seconds. (What is it with Zack Snyder movies and rain? I mean does he have a really weird fetish for it? Like I'm surprised the entire city didn't completely flood by the end of Watchmen.) But some action sequences were pretty enjoyable, like when Batman and Superman finally went toe to toe, when Batman rescues Superman's mother and the final battle with the ninja turtle, I mean ninja turtle, I mean ninja turtle, I mean Doomsday.So the movie's a bit of a mixed bag for me. I can't say I enjoyed it all the way through, but I can't say it gave me nothing to enjoy either. So I guess my advice is, if you want to see some good action and some of your favorite heroes kicking ass, you'll probably get your money's worth. But if you're expecting something that's a lot more focused and coherent, then I'd recommend skipping this one.6/10",6,1,2,1 November 2016
