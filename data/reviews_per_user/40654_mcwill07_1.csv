Scarface," Scarface
","Two Cuban refugees come to Florida to capture the American dream. Tony Montana played by Al Pacino and Manny Ribera played by Steven Bauer. This film takes place in Miami where Tony and Manny are released from a refugee camp after committing a murder. Once on the outside they meet and are hired by Omar Suarez played by F. Murray Abraham. Omar hires Tony and Manny to deliver money to the Colombians but this deal goes south. Shortly after Tony meet Frank Lopez played by Robert Loggia. Frank displays the life that Tony wants to have 'The American Dream' to Tony that's money, nice things, and a hot lady. To me the theme of this movie would be money and drugs won't lead you to the American dream. Once Tony and Manny are on Frank's payroll Tony wants more he always wants more. He wants Franks women Elvira Hancock played by Michelle Pfeiffer. Tony gets what he wants, he takes control of the drug scene in Miami, he takes Franks girl, and he feels that the world his. Along this road Tony has made many enemies and will soon learn the hard way. This film was the second at the time for Al Pacino playing the role of a gangster. The first was in the Godfather. These movies both have the power, money and drugs but the story lines are different. I personally like Scarface more but both are great movies. The music and sound effects in this movie brought it to life whether it's the shower scene with the chainsaw, the night club shooting, or my personal favorite scene at the end when Tony's home is being taken over. The sounds and music that are played during these scenes make the scenes at first you know something's about to happen and that's the music helping to build up what's about to take place. As for the sound effects like the chainsaw in the bathroom of the hotel you now know that something very bad is about to happen. That's the great part of sounds",10,0,2,18 September 2012
