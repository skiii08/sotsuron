Captain Phillips," From ten minutes in, I was rigid with tension.
","Regretfully the stoic conservative in me cannot give this film a '10'. Regret because I believe it deserves it, I might then slide the mouse back up and give it a nine but ten is reserved for films with strong regard to continuity, historical accuracy, great acting, cinema-photography, pathos, excitement, exhilaration, script, soundtrack et al. What was missing then? Certainly not excitement and exhilaration blended with much tension. The historical accuracy is probably OK and I ignored the usual American made movie seeming total disregard to continuity. All that doesn't matter because most importantly I was entertained. Fabulous value for money, thank you for that and well done.",8,1,3,16 November 2013
Prometheus," The alien 'child' bursts from a stomach again. Need more?
","A friend is hoping soon to be asked to point a camera on a new Ridley Scott movie. I hope to convince them to turn the lens on Scott and get him to take a good hard look into himself. After ten minutes, no I'm being generous it wasn't that long, I knew that this film would be awful. When the crew of the good 'ship'(2093 space explorer)awake from their induced hibernation, immediately one of the drowsy travellers in the style of a gnarled gold panner with an 'overnight shadow' that the others have managed to avoid, launches into a stereotypical tirade reminiscent of class wars which surely should have been eradicated a long time before launch. Even more sure however is that such disparate characters would never have been selected to embark together. OK the special effects are good but when you have 130 million to play with why not but I reckon you could give 130 quid to a local am-dram troupe and get much better value for many.",2,3,4,16 November 2013
