Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A totally rubbish movie....
","I saw the much awaited phantom menace yesterday, and was totally apalled. The acting was abysmal,the story corny and the characters boring. The only redeeming factor about this film was the special effects (but then you wouldnt expect any less from the founder of ILM). The film as a whole, didnt even come close to meriting the hype. And i feel sorry for the people who spent weeks sleeping out side of cinemas and stuff.I'm a great fan of the previous films (a new hope,empire and jedi) but this film wasnt up to that standard. I'd give it 3/10",Null,0,1,19 September 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," 'watch this, for ye not know when the master of the house cometh'
","I first saw The Shawhank Redemption a year back and I was totally blown away. this film is perfect in EVERY sense, from acting to story to score,to costume to cinematography. in fact i think they should have made a new academy award, best feeling film or something.This film was clearly ripped off at the 1994 oscars. forrest gump IS a good flick i agree, but if u look at character development,story and acting shawshank comes out on top.If for some reason u aint seen this film watch it now... it truly IS the greatest.and remember hope is a good thing maybe the best of things.....and no good thing ever dies....and nor will shawshank.
6.58x10^96 is what i give it out of 10",Null,0,0,25 March 2000
