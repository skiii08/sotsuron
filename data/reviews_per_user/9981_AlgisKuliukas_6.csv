Requiem for a Dream," Ugly but compelling.
","Not a pleasant film but one not to miss. It leaves you depressed but grateful. Fantastic acting, fast moving. Totally compelling. You cannot take your eyes off the screen for a second. A trully brilliant film.",9,0,1,2 December 2001
Memento," Over-complicated and overrated
","I was recommended this film by someone whose opinion I value. Perhaps consequently my expectations were too high and I was left just feeling disappointed.The positive thing about the film is that it did give an insight into how confusing life must be with this kind of short-term memory disorder - but so what?, is that supposed to be entertainment?It's a novel approach to show the ending of a film first and then work backwards but it made the (otherwise very simple) plot overly complicated and more like a memory-test puzzle than a film.The acting was good enough but I think that overall this film is greatly overrated - how on earth did it get in the ImDB top 10?Algis Kuliukas",4,4,7,3 December 2001
Reservoir Dogs," Depressingly vicious story about violent criminals
","Ok, Tarrantino's films are exceptionally well made. This one too. But I have to say I didn't like it very much.Like Pulp Fiction this film has some wonderful dialog. It was the promise of that, that attracted me to it in the first place. (So, clearly I saw this second.) However, unlike Pulp Fiction, you are not left with warm and uplifting memories of delightful, witty conversations at the end, instead the movie leaves you depressed and feeling sick at having just witnessed humanity pretty close to its worst. The unnecessarily vicious scenes of violence and endless ranting of angry men screaming at each other are what you take away from this film.If that's your idea of a good night out, you'll watch this and enjoy it. For me it was too bleak, too depressing. There was just not enough positive stuff to outweigh the negative.I loved Pulp Fiction but this was just too bloody horrible to be enjoyable for meAlgis Kuliukas",6,2,4,17 March 2002
A Beautiful Mind," One of the best films of all time
","If you have any doubts about this film, my advice is to put them to one side. In particular if you think the subject matter of a mathematician winning a Nobel prize for his work on gaming theory is a bit too, shall we say, techy or academic don't worry. The film is a masterpiece. I won't give anything away here but I'd just like to say that it is truly uplifting leaves you with a million thoughts about life, the way human beings behave, madness, love and a whole lot more. Russel Crowe gives one of the best acting performances I've ever seen.I gave it 10 out of 10. I think it is one of the best films I've ever seen.",10,0,1,4 October 2002
Vanilla Sky," Interesting futuristic view of cryogenics and longevity
","Apart from a few minutes of pure jealousy induced hatred when Tom Cruise was trying to blow away Cameron Diaz in favour of Penelope Cruz (what a choice!) I thought the film was really rather good.I like scenes in films which make you question one version of reality against another and this film had them in abundance. The plot gets better on a second or third viewing - if you're as thick as I am and get confused easily. I just love the whole concept of cryogenics and the issues it raises and I thought this film brought many of those issues out in a fascinating way.I don't normally find much interesting in Tom Cruise's usual action-packed hero/rich business kid roles but somehow I warmed to him this time. Perhaps it was seeing him get his face smashed in and having to cope with being plain ugly for a change that made him seem a bit more appealing. Then again, in the story his millions left him immortal and living in a dream world with Penelope Cruz for eternity. Not a bad future for anyone, except that for Cruise even that wasn't good enough! In films, as I suspect in real life, he always seems to get an obscene amount of 'the sweet' without ever having to take very much of 'the sour'. No, damn it, I hate him! ... But it was still a good film.Algis Kuliukas",Null,0,0,9 July 2003
Final Destination," Silly, but with a great crash scene
","I thought the film started brilliantly. I love that kind of hallucination/dream switch with reality. I thought the opening crash scene was marvellously horrific.So you find yourself in a really fascinating scenario: The guy had just had a premonition about a terrible disaster and then watched it actually happen. How would everyone cope? - Him with the guilt, the others with their suspicions of how he knew.If you missed the opening fifteen minutes either re-wind the tape or don't bother watching any more.Because.. instead of exploring those things the film took us down a stupidly childish story about hocus pocus and the dreaded grim reaper choosing who would die and who wouldn't and how, no matter how you try, you can't dodge your fate.The clever young hero had worked out what 'Death' had 'intended' - including the order that the escapees were 'supposed' to die. I hate this kind of nonsense.The film just gets worse the longer it goes on and the ending sums it all up.  I gave it 4 just for the crash scene and the first fifteen minutes.",4,2,3,28 December 2001
