Your Name.," This movie would make your heart heavy and then lighten it like nothing
","This movie is so beautiful,from the eye-popping animation to it's plot is flawless.Hands down one of the best anime movie ever.People often overlook anime as action but this movie's love story better than any romeo-Juliet.The starting makes you involve it with a humor base story which eventually turns a twist that their body stop swapping because the girl who he swaps body actually died 3 years ago,I was wtf at the moment but it was covered quick with tears.Some things are unpractical but this makes the movie more beautiful, I assume the ending can never be perfect by saying ' your name ', filled with my tears. Ps:- This movie OST perfectly matches the movie which always moves you.",10,3,6,28 January 2017
