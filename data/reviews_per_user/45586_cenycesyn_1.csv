Hereditary," Finally, a brilliant horror film
",This is a great film if you're not looking for a quick teen-scare horror film. Great suspense and buildup for the ending. It perfectly depicts a torn-apart mother who is going literally insane from all of her struggles in her life. Definitely a watch in my opinion.,9,3,6,15 December 2019
