It," it's one of my ALL TIME favorite movies.
",This movie was incredible. A very good representation of the book with some differences. The movie was so good I found myself wishing it was longer. I think that is because the book is so long and I like it so much. IT is an amazing movie!,9,1,2,12 July 2019

Green Book," Good Movie
",Good movie with really strong performances from the two lead actors. Good music too and I learned something about The Don Shirley Trio that I had never heard about before.,8,1,4,12 July 2019
The Cabin in the Woods," Loved this movie.
","At first it was slow and confusing. Had some humor to it which was enjoyable, yet felt misplaced. Even about halfway through I was getting bored. The last 45 minutes the movie really comes together. All questions are answered and you finally get the suspense and horror you've been waiting for. Not my favorite film, but would definitely watch again. If anything it's worth it for the over all story line. Very creative.",8,3,4,12 July 2019
