Marie Antoinette," Classic case of a Missed opportunity!
","I waited for over a year to see this much anticipated movie! Marie Antoinette was suppose to be the last remainning gem needed to crown Sofia as one of the best current Hollywood directors , instead it may have turned out to be her 'Heaven's Gate'. The movie is just a dumbfest! Sofia tells a story about absolutely nothing! She opted to disregard any historical or cultural reference of the time that may actually be relevant to our current lives! The movie is all about mood, and costums, It doesn't try to achieve anything,and it doesn't really try to entertain either! I read somewhere that before the movie started principal photography, Francis Ford actually told Sofia to go out there and make the movie she wanted to make!It became so tedious and painful to watch that after awhile I started to look forward to the beaheading of the young queen and maybe with a little luck the French too would get the head of Sofia Coppola and the producers of this travesty! (WHishfull thinking I guess) It just sounds to me like daddys little girl from pot smoking mtv generation is pissing Hollywood's money away and missing in the process a great opportunity to educate people around the world about important historical events that may or may not have helped shape the world we live in today! Kirstin Dunst is terrific as the tittle character in spite of Sofia Coppola's shortcomings. The movie is a great music video at best!Thats probably what she should stick with! I will never see a Movied directed by Sofia Coppola ever again, even if they pay me to! I suggest to those intelligent exe at the major studios never to finance any proyect with the name Sofia Coppola attached to it, assuming they want to keep their high paying jobs!",1,17,33,10 April 2007
Deja Vu," Really Entertainning!
","Tony Scott knows how to tell a story! Beautifully shot!Great casting! Best i have seen from Denzel in a very long time! Caviezel , and the girl are both good! Val Kilmer is excellent this time! Only one tiny little detail! There is one miniature shot at the beginning of the movie that just doesn't measure up with the rest of the film! All in all, it is a really good effort from Scott! Very original and well executed.Worth watching fellas!Most entertaining action flick of 07 and 06 tooA movie kids can watch.",6,1,2,6 May 2007
Disturbia," A major plothole!
","The movie starts out in the right direction, great casting, good acting, terrific cinematography.the director manages to generate a great deal of suspense and intrigue during the first two acts. The main characters are fresh and compelling, the scenes are well executed and efficiently edited, the sets are on the money, the narrative is light and yet, solidly entertaining. how can this not be a good movie, right? Well, what started out as a promising thriller, turned, all of the sudden into a mangle of predictable scenes previously seen on other movies, yes, this director actually butchered the main climatic scene with a series of clichéd situations, and worst, looses all sense of logic on his way to the final resolution, the two kids jumped into the pool, kale asks the girl to call the police, did she call? If she did, where did the police go? Kale's parole officer was at the scene with enough time to finish his hamburger, look around, and get assasinated by the former meticulous, and methodical now turned into savage barbarian 'lets just kill the entire neighbourhood' serial killer. Thats what i like to call, a major plothole! That lack of logic is what ruins a good movie folks.....",1,11,22,25 August 2007
The Dark Knight," Flawless Cinematic Art!
","Christopher Nolan has effectively raised the bar for movie makers everywhere (Including the big American cojunas)in terms of execution, and for movie goers in terms of expectations. This film works on every single level. The cast is excellent.. Christian Bale delivers again as the best batman the franchise has ever produced.Although not perfect, Mrs Gyllenhal does a very good job as The Vigilante's love interest and not as aesthetically appealing as Katie Holms but much more credible .Aaron Eckhart comes as the dark horse of this film, who would have thought Mister cool had those types of acting chops in him? credit to the whip of Mr. Nolan.The screenplay is pure gold!The dialogue are cunning, straight, and emotionally mature.you couldn't find any clichÃ© or meaningless word in here. It is a pity this movie did no receive the academy nomination, it has been a long time since the last time i watched a movie as good as this. In true, Mr Nolan has anointed himself new king of Hollywood, This movie is indeed pure cinematic art,it has action, drama,comedy, it has everything, and it also has a great uplifting ending. Hail to the new king of movies and keep on making them!",10,3,6,25 December 2009
There Will Be Blood," Short of brilliance.
","The movie starts out really well.The casting is great, the settings are believable. The dialogue are very good, they inform you, keep you intrigued. The direction is flawless, but thats were the positives end.This is a character driven story, you take Daniel Lewis out of it and you end up with a mediocre and dark story.Dano nails his character at the beginning but overacts a bit towards the end, you don't really get to learn much about his character except that he is an avid and fanatical prophet. The story is appealing and fresh until Plainview achieves his goal of becoming a millionaire, after that it falls into a tale of unmotivated excesses, crime, and murder, and yes, blood! An epic of this scale usually offers a couple of sweeping vistas but not here, wrong address. The movie feels a bit confined throughout. It doesn't really have a clear message and it doesn't have any redeeming qualities.Still, it is a movie worth watching but as far as calling it a masterpiece, well, it isn't the case, it falls way short of achieving that goal.nevertheless, it is worth watching.",5,4,9,25 March 2008
Inception," A magnificent dream that falls short on its execution
","Christopher Nolan has undoubtedly become one of the most important names in the business of contemporary filmed entertainment.He has taken us to places we did not know existed.He singlehandedly revived a languishing cartoon franchise and placed it in the pantheon of unforgettable classics. In his new adventure he takes on the uncharted universe of the subconscious. The premise in its scope is intriguing and unconceivable ambitious.he relies on the best movie making talent only a major movie studio can buy to achieve his goal.The special effects are terrific, the acting is pretty good, and the dialogue is also good, but the journey that started as an unrestrained adventure into the realms of the human thought generating universe turned half way thru into a tale of semi confusing scenes. The story never comes anywhere near of seducing its audience. The emotional factor is completely absent.The movie is worth watching and it does stand out mostly due to lack of quality competition, but it should not be an Oscar nominee. Christopher Nolan has done better work.",4,10,17,11 January 2011
The Good Shepherd," I ended up getting a massive headache!
","This Movie starts out on the wrong note! The worst researched script I've seen in a long time! The casting selection was horrible, even De Niro casting himself as an ailing four star general is a miss! Who would believe a General of that consecuential importance portrayed by an Italian gangster looking actor? He may be able to play a credible Justice Scalia in some other movie, some other day perhaps! The movie itself is slow, pointless, and tedious mess! The worst direction I've ever seen from an a-list actor turned director! Who is going to believe a twenty year old character played by femme fatale Angelina Jolie? What about this kid who played Damon's son? Was he suppose to be gay or what? Neither the screenplay nor the director bothered much to explain to the audience the logic behind of what unfolds on this drama turned disaster, you just have to take a leapt of faith and accept everything as a matter of fact! Joe Pesci appears in one scene not to add more depth to it or to add a new dimension, He only appears so The Character played by Damon Can say 'All the foreigners are just visiting here' . Why was Damon's son in Africa hanging out with black girls? was he already working for the agency? Was he living there? Was he working for the UN? was he selling guns to Al Queda? No one knows! The truth is that no one really cared much about this particular guy in the first place! This Mess of a movie goes on forever! You keep glancing at your watch hoping for an end that never comes!The movie tries to take on too much and It doesn't really achieve anything it sets out to do! The biggest irony of all, the bonus features: loads of Deleted Scenes! Thats sickening! It will be awhile before i pay to see De Niro's face anywhere again!",1,4,9,9 April 2007
