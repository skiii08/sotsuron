Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Consistent, complete, and complimentary
","This movie was great!!  The story was well planned, and didn't contradict any of the previous movies (as some sequels or prequels sometimes do).  I was also impressed by the way that the sets, props, backgrounds, etc., were all consistent with the other movies.  Sure, it's been 16 years since the last Star Wars movie, but the look of the movies is still the same (no drastic set changes, like from Star Trek, the original series, and Star Trek, the motion picture).  The opening sequence is also consistent with the original movies.  In the movie itself, the story flows well, the action is fast-paced, and the special effects are used very well to enhance the telling of the story, not eclipsing the story.  Although this movie is a prequel, like the other Star Wars movies, this movie is complete unto itself, while still adding to the greater story.  All in all, this is yet another great achievement by George Lucas, and I expect more to come!",10,0,0,24 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Shocking, funny, and meaningful.
","Sure, the South Park movie is as raunchy as you'd expect.  Matt and Trey go all out to evoke some kind of reaction from everyone.  It's also just as funny as you've always expected.  A friend of mine was in tears from laughing so hard.  The song and dance numbers, something I don't usually enjoy in a movie, were fantastic.  And all of the twisted humor you've come to expect from South Park is here.  But there's also a commentary on society today, and how we should worry less about what's going on in society and deal more with what's going on with ourselves.  All in all, I think this movie was fantastic.",10,0,0,1 July 1999
