United 93," Too soon for this movie, you say?
","I have been reading many comments on this movie reading on how people complain, 'it is far too soon for this movie to be made' 'this is going to cause too much heartbreak' Wow.... And these movies on events such as World War II and Vietnam...you think the veterans of those wars have forgotten the pain and anguish? You think its easy for them to see movies like that? We stuck by our country for a year after September 11th...flags and other objects of our affection and pride towards this country. I hate to see that we can only show our true honor of being an American only in its time of need and when things begin to return to normal we put the pride that others can see. (Anyone understand where I'm going with this?) People...it is NOT too soon for us to make a movie about September 11th...its too soon for us to be forgetting it...",10,0,2,5 August 2006
