Spartacus," Big moments
","Overall, the film is pretty good.  Kubrick made good use of a script that could have turned out to be horrible and created one of the most epic 'Historical' pictures ever.  It's authenticity is pretty good, although the American accents and glaringly 'Hollywood-ized' dialog do hurt (as well as Jean Simmons' 'slave-girl-with-the-hour-long-makeup-job' look).  These burps are more than equaled by the spectacular battle near the end and the engrossing political games played in Rome.  As far as actors go, it's a mixed bag.  While all of the performances were good, I was never able to accept Kirk Douglas and Jean Simmons in their parts (mostly because of the above-mentioned Hollywood corruption).  Still, it's proves that while Stanley Kubrick could make thoughtful and left-of-center films, he could also make huge mainstream epic ones as well.  The film world will miss him.",Null,2,5,10 July 1999
Brokeback Mountain," Easier to admire than to enjoy
","It's going to be very hard to put forth an 'objective' opinion about this film. It has crossed over from being just a movie to a cultural milestone that is regarded and lauded as one of the best love stories out there.I'm sorry, but I don't think it is.Despite the strong acting of the leads and the stunning cinematography of Wyoming, the central story felt rushed and incomplete. There was little to no explanation or backstory on why these two felt so strongly for each other. Sure, they had sex, but as many straight and gay people can tell you, that in and of itself doesn't lead to a lengthy relationship where each party pines for the other and awaits their time together. In addition, the movie abruptly jumps forward years in time with nothing more than a cut. Then the ending pops up out of nowhere and felt like a complete tear jerking cheat. I understand what Ang Lee was trying to do, but couldn't he and the screenwriters have come up with something more original than having a character killed off? Personally, I would've found it much more devastating if both parties remained alive, but realized that their dream could not come true due to the outside forces aligned against them. All of this feels like the result of an editor that was too scissor happy. It's rare to say this, but this film needed to be longer. It needed to explore the depths of these characters more than it did.Now I'm sure that I'm going to be branded as a homophobe by some simply because I didn't think this movie was the greatest film ever, much like disliking 'The Passion of the Christ' makes you an atheist. However, I am trying to separate the film itself from the taboos and societal barriers that it broke. As a film that actually depicts a male on male relationship without resorting to stereotypes or cheap comedy, its impact is huge. It's too bad that the film itself just isn't all that great as a piece of pure cinema. I am sincerely hopeful that this film acts as a springboard for mainstream movies to deal openly with this topic. Eventually we may see a 'gay' romance movie that finds all the nuances and depth of character that 'Brokeback Mountain' missed.So, to summarize. This film's release will hopefully user in a new era where homosexual relationships are treated with the same fairness as hetero ones, and the boundary that has been placed between 'traditional' and 'progressive' morality will disappear. But as a film, and judged outside of it's societal impact, 'Brokeback Mountain' is an attractive, yet incomplete film that fails to adequately explain why these two grow to care for each other so much that it consumes them alive. It is and always will be remembered as the first mainstream 'gay romance' movie, but this historical fact is not enough to elevate the movie itself above the level of 'well meaning, but flawed'.",7,1,18,17 September 2006
Closer," Rough and bleak look at modern romance
","Closer is my kind of movie: smartly written, expertly acted, and riveting to watch even though not a single hint of action occurs.Based off a stage play, the story revolves around two couples and the interactions between them. It all starts out fairly simple, with British Dan meeting American Alice in a park and causing American Anna and Larry the doctor to meet as well. They seem like cute and normal couples, but it doesn't take long for things to unravel. By the halfway point one character essentially hops to another bed and the remainder of the film starts it slow spiral into darkness. By the time the credits roll only one relationship is left standing, and even that is revealed to be one-sided and eventually doomed to fail. This journey is realized through some extremely sharp and frequently very profane language that bears more than a passing resemblance to David Mamet(don't believe the Parent's Guide if it mentions only 'mild profanity').The acting is very well done, with Jude Law inhabiting his character with conviction. Natalie Portman finally proves that she can act, although she doesn't appear fully willing to 'inhabit' the role of a stripper (rumor has it she did film topless scenes, but they are not in the final cut so for all intents do not exist). Even Julia Roberts, the epitome of Hollywood celebrity, manages to be quite good. The real leader of this pack though is Clive Owen. His Larry is the only one that really shifts during the movie, and by the end of the film the good natured family doctor is revealed to be the most vicious and misanthropic of all the characters. His final confrontation with Dan is a perfect scene of ruthless verbal attacks, barely contained rage, and a final blow that proves he is in charge and will 'win' at all costs.Needless to say this is not a good date movie, and is something best viewed by yourself and followed by a cold shower. Spending almost 2 hours with these self centered and self destructive people will dim your view of love and humanity, but it's a ride worth taking.",8,1,1,20 October 2008
Glory," Better than 'Ryan'
","'Glory' is better than 'Saving Private Ryan'.  Where Ryan had amazing movie technology working for it, it's feeble script undermined almost everything except for the two battle sequences.  Here, on the other hand, is a movie that is interesting every step of the way.  From the opening shot of a soldier losing his head (one of the most graphic shots I've seen) to the final moment this film is filled with unforgettable images.  It's rare that I see a movie that makes me sit still for hours on end trying to digest everything I've just seen.  Even the final shot of Shaw's grave makes me choke up.  Even though the scene is guilty of some of the most brutal manipulation ever, it works because director Zwick actually knows what he's doing (as opposed to a clunky shame like 'Patch Adams').  By the way, I have to aknowledge the smart move he made by combining his beautifully shot film with James Horner's perfect score (believe it or not, it's better than Titanic).",Null,0,1,27 July 1999
Armageddon," beautiful look.....ummmm....
","At first, I watched the whole thing, now, I watch the action.  I honestly think Michael Bay is a great action movie director, but the buck stops there.  The quote 'dramatic' unquote scenes are some of the clunkiest this side of a Roland Emmerich film.  Thankfully the movie has great visual effects and fine sound effects (pain-inducing as they are).  The script is beyond dumb, it is built for the brain dead.  It wouldn't have surprised me if a 'laugh' or 'cry' caption appeared at the proper moment.  Bruce Willis isn't horrible (that little tear running down his face at the end was a nice touch), but he is far from Oscar caliber.  Liv Tyler is starting to wear out her 'pouty whiner' act, and Ben Affleck's role had me desiring to stick a shotgun up his ass and pull the trigger.  One thing that I really can't help but notice is how blatantly poor the science is, such as the mysterious phenomenon that allows India and the US to watch the asteroid explode in broad daylight (maybe the Earth really is flat...), and the infamous space station sequence.  It would have been really cool if they had gone for some accuracy and had some actors walking on the ceiling while others walk on the walls and/or floor, but that's asking a little too much.  The only way I can watch this movie now is in widescreen, with the lights off and the Pro Logic surround turned WAY WAY up.  Sadly after two hours even this approach can't save this overblown and rotten piece of eye candy.",Null,0,1,31 March 1999
Apocalypse Now," Scary
","This is one of the creepiest films I've ever seen.  What starts off as a fairly standard Vietnam war film slowly transforms into a surrealistic nightmare that makes me crawl.  When Sheen and his boys find Kurtz and his tribal home, I had trouble believing that the earlier scenes are part of the same movie.  The battle scene at the bridge is by far the most chaotic and disturbing battle scene ever made, and perfectly points out how random and hopeless war is.  I am one of the people who think Marlon Brando's requests and...immature attitude actually benefited his part.  After all the buildup in the movie, would it really make sense to film him in anything other than shadows?  His semi ad-libbed dialog also helped by giving the impression that the Colonel had to struggle to make his thought coherent enough to form a sentence.  Overall this is the most atypical war movies ever and all of it's aspects fit together perfectly.",Null,0,0,10 April 1999
Independence Day," The ultimate Big Cheese
","Okay, this movie is a mixed bag for me.  In the theater it was incredible, on video it loses quite a bit.  See, once you view it on tape, you can begin to see flaws in the special effects (the fireballs look like oil clouds with some light thrown in) and the gaping holes in the plot stick out like a sore thumb.  This movie becomes more and more of a 'Photogenic patriots play dodgeball with giant squids' type.  The saddest part of the whole ordeal is realizing that this whole movie was intended to be this way.  I have no doubt that Roland Emmerich has the potential to write a good script.  But if people continue to shower him with riches when he makes hollow firecrackers like this, it might never happen.",Null,0,0,10 November 1998
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Big budget, big mistake
","Credit the previews, They made me think this movie was going to kick ass. Whoops.  I left the theater wanting my $6.50 back.  This movie has the feel and pacing of something thrown together over a vacation to rack up some bucks.  It hardly seems like a Spielberg film at all.  The action sequences were pretty dull and a little too long.  After five plus minutes of the 'Car over the cliff' sequence, I was really getting restless.  The San Diego sequence was completely unwarranted and reeked of something tacked on at the last minute.  The only good part was the death of the dog.  I like dogs as much as the next person, but this is payback for the manipulative dog tactics of 'Volcano', 'Dante's Peak', 'Twister', and 'Independence Day'. Just about every actor was wasted in this movie, with the possible exception of Pete Postlethwaite and Jeff Goldblum.  Sadly even these characters can't rise above a completely moronic script.  And while I'm on the subject, why wouldn't an amimal expert realize that bringing a wounded baby into a trailer is just asking for a slow death.  It's the abundence of stupid coincidences like this that make Lost World a lost cause.",Null,0,1,11 November 1998
The Untouchables," Good, not great
","I can understand the hype.  But this isn't a 'Must see masterpiece.' Although I loved DeNiro's performance, I really think the Al Capone character was horribly underwritten, I hardly felt like I knew the character even at the end of the film.  Of course, Sean Connery was the best thing about this movie.  Hands down there.  I think this movie would've been much better if they'd taken more time to develop the characters and show the workings of the alcohol smuggling.  Still, all the shortcomings are almost equalled by the elaborate sets, costumes, and camerawork.  In the end it's a good movie, but it serves more as a shoot-em-up than a serious drama.",Null,0,0,19 December 1998
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," At least I can say I saw it
","Wow, what a difference 2 years can make in a franchise. The original Transformers, while not a great example of filmaking, was at least fun. Dumb and vacant, yes, but fun. Can't say the same thing about this one. I never thought I'd call a Michael Bay action pic boring, but this movie proved me wrong, and I'm not sure why. All the requisite 'Bay-isms' are there: big explosions, the fetish for military hardware, dizzying whirl-a-cam, second long shots that leave you with no sense of space, mostly naked chicks, loud thundering soundtrack, and generic music score. It should work, hell, it's worked for most of his other movies. For some reason, all of the elements fail this time around. None of the action is even remotely exciting, despite the blaring bass and immersive surround sound. In the middle of the final battle, I was reading texts on my phone instead of watching the carnage, since after 25 minutes of constant booms and bangs I just didn't care anymore.While Bay's films have rarely had 'great' scripts, also rarely has one failed on this many levels. Showing all the hallmarks of something rushed out the door, the script used to film this movie is horribly disjointed. Contrary to others I was able to figure out the 'plot' fairly well, but that doesn't mean that I liked what was going on. Each transformer comes either personality free or saddled with a juvenile ghetto stereotype (complete with a gold tooth and illiteracy, in some cases). So many outrageous coincidences happen to propel this movie forward, from the 'other primes' to the instant resurrection of Megatron, to the convenient 'death' and instant resurrection of Optimus, to the 'transformer transporter', to the 'robot gods', I could go on and on. Point is even by summer popcorn standards, this script is horrible and makes the ridiculous script from the first movie read like something from the Nolan brothers.Still, that shouldn't be a deterrence, since Bay has always been about devastation, explosions, and groundbreaking special effects. The explosions, on their own grounds, are pretty, and the destruction is technically adept. Surprisingly, I found the CGI to be a step down from the first movie. While most of the models appear to be the same, the rendering of the robots appears much more 'fake' this time around. Rarely do they take on a physical presence in the shot, and the physics violating animation of the first movie is taken to such a Loony Tunes extreme here that I never bought into what I was seeing. It's been a long time since I've seen CGI sand look as fake as it does when Devastator kicks on his vacuum.Still, despite all this I didn't hate the movie. I'm actually very ambivalent about it. I'm genuinely puzzled how it made so much money. I'm also more and more convinced that Michael Bay is turning into a modern equivalent of Ed Wood. He clearly loves the process of making films, and seems to genuinely enjoy setting up big explosions and playing with real tanks. He seems to care less and less about the end product as the years go on though, as if everything that doesn't go BANG isn't worth his time. Given how much cash this movie hauled in, I don't see that getting any better.Oh, I forgot to mention the actors. There are a few of them in the picture, and they run around and scream a lot. Then they get out of the way so another CGI cartoon can bound through the scene, cause a few over-sized explosions, and get shot at by tanks.",3,2,7,6 February 2010
The Sixth Sense," Definition of overblown
","I can't figure it out.  What's the big deal with this film?  It wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's nowhere near the top, and certianly not one I would place on a 'best picture' roster.  I'm firmly convinced that Willis is incapable of breaking out of his dull monotone, and although Osment was fairly good, several of his scenes left me with my eyes rolling. The dialog for the most part was howlingly stilted, but provided for plenty of laughs.  The supposed suprise ending was nothing of the sort, and left me thinking 'yeah, so what?'  I'm sure Shayamalan is in love with his home town, but the way he presents it is dull and uninspired and makes it look about as fun to live in as the town I'm in.  Also I can't figure out why people watch this ten times in a row.  I saw it once, got the plot (?!?!) and feel no need, or desire, to watch it again.  Every now and then a majorly hyped movie lives up to it's expectations, but this one left me with one thought: 'thank God it didn't win Best Picture'.  If it did I might have to pull the Vincent Grey routine with the Academy voters.",Null,0,0,8 April 2000
