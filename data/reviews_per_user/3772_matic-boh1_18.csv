Walk the Line," A musical legend honoured through superb acting
","One does not often come across a film of considerable length that manages to keep the audience engaged at all times, but Walk the Line does so rather effortlessly, as the film successfully captures the chronicles of the legendary country singer Johnny Cash, largely due to the magnificent acting performances that are on display. Although the writing and directing is strong, it is the superior acting abilities of both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in the leading roles that define this biopic, as the two actors shine individually while also sharing terrific on screen chemistry. Although the film may not be the most adequate musical tribute to Johnny Cash, it does successfully portray him as a man, capturing his intense and rebellious character, as well as the special bond he shared with his eventual wife June Carter. Walk the Line is a touching and passionate film that succeeds in somewhat exploring the enigma that was Johnny Cash, with perhaps the greatest testament to the film's quality being the fact that love for country music is not needed in order for one to enjoy it.",8,0,0,23 June 2014
The Monuments Men," Simply disappointing
","Although the foundation for it is a fascinating story of a group of men that aimed to rescue famous artwork from the Nazis during the Second World War, The Monuments Men fails to place its remarkable narrative in the forefront, and is rather dominated by poor writing, poor direction and overall lack of momentum. The film seems to be approached entirely in the wrong way, as its tone is often far too casual and humorous, despite it recounting a war story of great significance and interest. The audience is constantly exposed to awkward shifts between comedic and emotionally intense scenes, and due to the unflattering execution, the film is ultimately not particularly amusing nor dramatic. Perhaps its greatest appeal is an impressively star-studded cast, but as it often happens in such cases no one is able to truly shine, which results in a film that offers no outstanding performances. Overall, The Monuments Men is a film with incredibly noble intentions that lacks quality in execution, and despite its intriguing story undoubtedly deserving better, the outcome is ultimately very disappointing.",4,1,1,6 June 2014
Alien," 'sci-fi masterpiece'
","Thrilling, mysterious and gripping throughout, Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi masterpiece Alien is undoubtedly deserving of its cult status, as the film's stunning visual effects set the standard for the genre, inspiring many to follow its footsteps. Remarkably well-directed and designed, the film's outstanding feature is its ability to successfully maintain the tone of suspense and fear, as the audience follows the space crew in their struggles, trying to combat the alien that invades their ship. Although Alien offers few dynamic action scenes, it is the constant fear of the unknown and the lurking presence of the deadly creature that ultimately defines the film. Many have tried, but few have succeeded in recapturing the riveting style of Alien, both in terms of the film's groundbreaking cinematic techniques and its exhilarating storytelling approach.",8,0,1,28 May 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," An action-packed adventure
","The second installment of this superhero's film series does not disappoint, as Captain America: The Winter Soldier combines a solid story with a heavy dosage of exciting action. As any sequel should do, it offers the audience an overall improvement of the first film in all departments, with all the main characters being further developed and the action sequences also being upgraded to much higher levels of exhilaration. Although the first Captain America film proved satisfying, the continuation of the franchise is far more compelling, as the film is able to optimize its capacities, allowing Captain Steve Rodgers to truly shine, thus enabling the viewers to appreciate his role as the ultimate soldier. Along with it being well-designed and fiercely action packed, the film also manages to use a very interesting storyline to reinvigorate the Marvel Universe and the world of the Avengers. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is therefore perhaps the best Marvel film following The Avengers, surpassing the likes of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, as it sets new standards of quality, both in terms of story and execution.",7,0,1,2 June 2014
In the Name of the Father," A riveting depiction of historical injustice
","Led by magnificent acting performances and great direction, In the Name of the Father offers the audience a terrific reenactment of one of the most infamous miscarriages of justice in the history of Britain, as it portrays the story of Gerry Conlon and his father, and the false accusations made against them in regards to the Guildford pub bombings in 1974. By exploring a very controversial issue, this enthralling drama proves to be a very eye-opening and thought provoking viewing experience, one that is both politically and morally charged. Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite give extremely passionate performances, as they serve as the centerpiece for a film that strikes a strong balance between exploring the estranged father-son relationship and the surrounding political issues. In the Name of the Father therefore proves thoroughly engaging, as it has perpetual motion, both due to its powerful story, but also due to the excellent filmmaking techniques that are one display.",8,0,0,18 July 2014
The Lego Movie," Imaginative and entertaining, with a subtle message underneath
","A fun, entertaining and surprisingly clever film, The Lego Movie combines an amusing script with a terrific cast of characters, while also containing a profound and thoughtful message underneath. The exceptionally well-designed and colorful animation creates a visually very impressive film, however perhaps its best feature is the intelligent and creative writing that produces a touching story, with a plethora of comedic inputs along the way. For the most part the film relies heavily on its humorous aspect, offering numerous pop culture references and a satirical view of different genres and various notable film characters. Yet, The Lego Movie ultimately uses its imaginative approach to communicate to its audience many deep and highly significant ideas, inspiring creativity and individualism in its viewers. Overall, it is a delightful comedy adventure with a stimulating story in its core, thus making it a film well-worth watching.",7,0,1,5 June 2014
Non-Stop," A thrilling, yet somewhat absurd action film
","When an action film offers an interesting premise along with Liam Neeson as the leading man, one expects nothing short of an exciting and enjoyable experience, and Non-Stop does prove satisfying, even if somewhat nonsensical. In large part, the audience is exposed to great levels of unpredictability and very mysterious circumstances, as an air marshal attempts to save his fellow passengers on a trans-Atlantic flight from a terrorist attack. The film is gripping and thrilling throughout, with plenty of tense moments maintaining the feeling of suspense, however it certainly deserved a much more clever final act, rather than concluding as a conventional action film. Although Liam Neeson does again perform well in a leading action role, one cannot help but argue that the rest of the cast, which included such notable names as Julianne Moore, should have been utilized far better. Overall, Non-Stop comes across as an enthralling action film with a rather ludicrous storyline, which is initially well-developed but unfortunately seems to lack a fitting end.",6,1,2,28 June 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A witty and visually astounding adventure tale
","It is rare for one to come across a film which is both hilarious and touching at the same time, but The Grand Budapest Hotel manages to capture that with great ease and incredible originality. The audience is presented with a whirlwind story that shows the adventures of a legendary hotel concierge and his trusted lobby boy, which is absurd and exciting at one moment, and deeply emotional at the next. Wes Anderson proves his exceptional ability as an imaginative and creative filmmaker, as every scene is carefully detailed and flawlessly designed. The film also encompasses a stellar cast of actors, all of whom seem carefully chosen for their particular roles, which helps to create characters that are slightly peculiar, yet very interesting. Not only is The Grand Budapest Hotel visually astonishing, it is also well-paced, constantly engaging and it offers a witty and unique screenplay accompanied by outstanding music.",8,1,3,5 June 2014
Frozen," Great music combined with magical animation
","An enjoyable and exciting adventure tale for the whole family, which also includes many terrific musical numbers, Frozen successfully recaptures the magic and thrill of Disney storytelling. By uniquely placing the story in a Scandinavian setting, Disney further adds to the wide variety of films they have designed through the years, while also having the chance to showcase the truly mesmerizing animation techniques. Although the film is visually very impressive and has an extremely memorable soundtrack, with Idina Menzel's Let It Go being particularly captivating, the story itself does come across as one lacking depth and intensity. Despite the well-developed characters, the film is far less complex when compared to other notable Disney pictures, with the twist in the storyline also being somewhat predictable. All in all, however, the humorous aspect of the film and the strength of its music does ultimately prevail, making Frozen a fun and entertaining experience, thus again proving the ever-lasting magic of Disney animation.",7,3,7,30 May 2014
22 Jump Street," A worthy sequel
","Hilarious, often outrageous, but above all thoroughly entertaining, 22 Jump Street manages to recapture all the humor and audacity its successful predecessor had to offer, while also offering some new thrills and unpredictability along the way. The film strikes a unique and clever balance between exploring new comedic ideas and continuing the themes from the first installment, as it maintains its core story but also offers enough twists to create new excitement. Although the storyline is very much similar to the first film, it does seem fresh and original at the same time, which creates a sequel that can be differentiated from others, as the plot is not merely redesigned in an awkward and uninteresting way. But perhaps the film's dominant feature continues to be the strong chemistry between the two leading men, who again combine their talents to create the ultimate comedy team. Overall this comedy sequel stands out due to its ability to embrace the success of the its predecessor, as 22 Jump Street uses the power of repetition to recreate the unique comedic atmosphere, which allows the film to establish a very distinct comedy series.",7,34,58,12 June 2014
Patton," An excellent war biopic of an American hero
","A great World War Two historical drama of epic proportions which offers a highly impressive and resounding biographical portrayal of perhaps the greatest American combat general. The acting of George C. Scott is simply superb, as he captures the ruthless, unwavering and stubborn character of General Patton, a man who thrived in the disciplined military system and was a firm believer of the eternal glory of war. The film is remarkably well paced considering its length, as it flows beautifully through the different settings showing George Patton in the last two years of the war and illustrating his controversial nature, all the while also allowing the audience to develop a great deal of admiration and respect for the man. Due to the exquisite cinematography and production design all the scenes are brilliantly constructed, portraying the war in a realistic and accurate manner, which makes Patton a very interesting viewing experience, one that offers an absorbing blend of a war film and a biopic, with both aspects executed to mere perfection.",8,1,1,25 July 2014
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A mind-bending exploration of a romantic mind
","Combining very solid acting performances with an extremely clever and beautifully executed storyline, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind draws upon very imaginative writing and offers its audience a mind-boggling emotional journey through the mind and memories of a hopeless romantic, skillfully portrayed by Jim Carrey. Although the film does come across as slightly confusing in its early stages, the story does eventually come together rather seamlessly, as all the elements are expertly structured together to create a magnificent final product. The entire cast definitely deserves praise, but the film's outstanding feature is undoubtedly the brilliant editing and overall design, which successfully creates a very memorable viewing experience, one that is intriguing and touching all at the same time. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind can therefore be described as being both intellectually provocative and emotionally satisfying, a combination of qualities that few films can truly relate to.",8,0,1,3 July 2014
There Will Be Blood," Daniel Day-Lewis shines in an otherwise unexceptional period drama
","It is mainly the ferocious and commanding performance of Daniel Day-Lewis that gives value to a film where themes of family, religion and greed intertwine in portraying the merciless nature of the turn of the century oil business. There Will Be Blood proves to be a fairly intriguing film and one that explores very complex ideas, with Day-Lewis's despicable and malicious character personifying the principle of the story, as he is propelled by an untamable and maddening thirst for wealth. However, despite having a very solid and captivating opening phase, the film then loses its strong momentum and later begins to feel rather empty and flat, with only Day-Lewis's impressive acting skills ultimately capturing one's attention and carrying the story forward. Although it cannot be argued that the cinematic visuals presented by director Paul Thomas Anderson are striking and that the film's soundtrack proves powerful, the narrative of There Will Be Blood seems fractured and is unimpressive, resulting in a film which is worth viewing for Daniel Day-Lewis's towering performance, but sadly not much else.",6,1,4,25 July 2014
The Reader," An emotionally compelling exploration of post-war Germany
","Spearheaded by forceful performances, The Reader is a very well-crafted historical drama that succeeds in portraying a story that is provided by very challenging source material, as an incredibly intimate relationship is used to explore the moral and emotional issues that arose in the scope of the Holocaust and its aftermath. Kate Winslet is simply outstanding in her role, and one cannot say enough about the quality of her acting, particularly due to the fact that the character she portrays is very unsympathetic and distant. Interestingly enough, the Holocaust is not placed in the forefront, but is rather maintained as a constant backdrop to the story, which makes for an extremely powerful and riveting viewing experience. The Reader is therefore the type of film that proves very gripping as it takes its audience on an emotional journey, one that has even greater resonance due to its main subject being Germany's postwar guilt.",7,0,0,9 July 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the greatest
","Well-acted, well-directed, powerful and thought-provoking, The Shawshank Redemption encompasses all of the above, as it tells the incredibly inspiring story of friendship and hope. Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine in their roles as inmates who develop a remarkable bond during their imprisonment, facing the struggles of prison life together and ultimately finding redemption. Although it focuses on a very familiar theme, The Shawshank Redemption stands out from the rest of the films in its genre, mainly due to the extremely intimate portrayal of its characters it has to offer. The film successfully uses its prison setting as a lens for society, and manages to present the audience with important life lessons throughout the storyline. Although not designed as a film of epic proportions, its nature does have an immense emotional impact on the viewer, which makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest films of all time.",10,0,0,26 May 2014
Paths of Glory," A thought-provoking critique of the military
","Not only does one get an opportunity to appreciate brilliant directing and stunning cinematography, Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory also examines highly significant themes of morality and integrity, making it a very powerful and truly great film. By focusing on the exploits of the French army during the years of the First World War, Kubrick successfully manages to expose flaws within the military system, highlighting the immoral behavior of the commanding officers, as well as the unjust treatment of the soldiers. Kirk Douglas' terrific acting skills are on display in the leading role, as he portrays a colonel that challenges the conduct of his superior officers, thus epitomizing the ideas of justice and ethical behaviour. Due to its flawless execution, the film serves as a very thought-provoking critique of the military and again proves Kubrick's distinct ability to confront delicate themes with a simple, yet impactful approach. Paths of Glory is perhaps the most realistic cinematic portrayal of the grueling trench warfare endured by millions during the Great War, and undoubtedly one of Kubrick's finest.",8,0,1,2 June 2014
Godzilla," Nowhere near its potential, yet enjoyable
","Perhaps the most highly anticipated film of the 2014 summer season that masterfully built up suspense in the trailers leading up to it, Godzilla adds new life and excitement to the long-lasting franchise, yet one is left feeling slightly dissatisfied with the finished product. Surprisingly enough, the film places humans in the forefront, mainly focusing on character development rather than the exploits of the notorious monster. Although this approach is successfully executed, with Bryan Cranston being particularly deserving of praise and Aaron-Tyler Johnson also giving a solid performance, it does result in Godzilla becoming a character driven film, which ultimately hurts its essence. However, despite the fact that it presents the audience with an unexpected and uncharacteristic framework, the film does manage to maintain its trademark thrilling style. Godzilla is undoubtedly an enjoyable cinematic experience, and even though it offers far less action than one would anticipate, it is worth watching for the gripping visual and sound effects alone.",6,1,2,26 May 2014
Heat," A well-executed crime drama
","One could hardly ask for more than to see Al Pacino and Robert De Niro perform together in an engrossing action drama, and Heat definitely provides the thrill that is expected from a film with such a star-studded cast. Along with the two very strong leading performances, this crime drama also puts on display the terrific filmmaking abilities of Michael Mann, who manages to bring a great deal of passion and the feeling of sensation to the genre. The story is rather typical, but the unexpected emphasis on character development lifts the film, as interpersonal relationships are explored in a very compelling way. Although the film is perhaps a bit too long, and as a result feels slightly flat at times, it is carried by tremendous acting and ultimately does offer the audience a very solid ending. Heat succeeds in presenting the duality between the police and the criminals, while also providing the necessary action alongside it, which ultimately does differentiate the film from others in its genre.",7,1,3,28 June 2014
