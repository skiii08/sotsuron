Antz," So-so
","I was restless after about 30 minutes; great animation, but draggy slow pacing.  Loved the puns, and the Woody Allen persona infused in 'Z'!",6,0,0,24 October 1998
Ali," Bright spots but drags too much
","Jon Voight is superb as Howard Cosell...absolutely terrific.  The movie, overall, was worth seeing, and entertaining.  It dragged too much; during the middle some scenes were far too drawn out.  Also, it was amusing to see pay phones in the 1960's scenes that were far too modern...they had the 1980/1990 aluminum and electric blue casings...a little goof, I believe.",6,0,0,27 December 2001
Minority Report," awful film, great disappointment
","I walked out after the first hour of this film.  With the great reviews it had gotten (Ebert, et al), I was looking forward to it.  Instead, I got a vehicle for Tom Cruise, who's an okay actor, except I don't dissolve merely at his looks.  The movie quickly deteriorated into action-explosions-shooting-jetpacs-vomiting-punching-snot-strangling...you get the idea.  This was followed by more dizzying 'action.'  The basic premise of the film was fine, intriguing in fact.  But what I saw was an action film made for lonely 11 year-old boys or Tom Cruise fans.  As I left, I stopped at the popcorn counter, and the woman told me many people had also walked out.  It's amazing how this film can be called 'the best film of the year.'  By what measure?  By the amount of money spent on its promotion?  A big, big disappointment.  Read the short story, instead.",1,6,11,2 July 2002
Meet the Parents," I want my money back
","This is perhaps the worst film I have seen in ten years.  It simply was not funny...the gags were predictable (His name was 'Focker'...her middle name Martha...they marry and what's her full name???)  Awful.  Not even DeNiro can save this one.  The theater wasn't 1/3 full, and only a little red haired lady in the back would laugh now and then...I walked out it was so bad, and really would like my money back.",1,15,28,12 October 2000
Shakespeare in Love," Awfully boring
","I'm amazed that this film got such rave reviews.  To me it was one of the most boring soap operas possible.  Yes, if you like looking at handsome young guys, they're there.  But the dialogue, the accents, the music was terrible.  Ridiculous to hear Elizabeth I, the most powerful person in England in the 1580's, commiserate with women 'Yes, I know how difficult it is to make it in a man's world'  Sigh.  Tough being the most powerful person in the world.  Don't waste your money.  Watch 'Santa Barbara' or 'Secret Storm' and set it back 400 years.",1,40,75,18 January 1999
Elizabeth," Please...no more chick flicks!
","It's hard to take these films seriously, because they are so patronizing to both women and men.  Give her a brewski, put her in a Hummer, and be done with it.  I don't ask for historical accuracy, but I don't ask to be set up with an un-believable premise.",1,1,4,18 January 1999
Knocked Up," just not as funny as I thought it would be
","I just don't find people constantly screaming 'f--- you!' (or at times, omitting the 'you') very funny in itself. The characters' intensity was very draining, directed at each other, at those they loved, at perfect strangers, or at themselves. The characters had no obvious means of support, nor did they have any jobs or occupation, or family commitments. They seemed to caricature the oldest California stereotypes.But to me, what was most discomforting was the anti-Muslim 'banter' early in the film by the group of boys (men?) who had been clearly identified as being Jewish several times in the film. Maybe that was to give it a certain 'edginess' that unrelenting sexual references no longer provide? Anyway, I found the movie to be unbelievable and tedious, and I waited out the last 10 minutes in the lobby.",1,10,19,1 July 2007
Cast Away," Two-plus-hour long commercial for FedEx
","I liked the movie, although I was just overtaken with how this exemplifies product placement gone wild...this movie doesn't only feature soft drinks, coffee, sporting goods brands, but it is, in itself, one huge commercial for Federal Express...The U.S. Post Office should sue for restraint of trade or something.  Yeah, Tom Hanks was pretty good, but the movie was overly long...could've used a commercial break.",6,2,3,30 December 2000
Man on the Moon," terrific
",Jim Carrey shows what a phenomenal actor he is in this film...don't miss it. DeVito shows his acting stuff as well. Don't miss it....................... One last point:  Don't miss it.,10,0,1,26 December 1999
Dumb and Dumber," funny, mild gross out, but worth it
","Just as I said:  it's funny, mild-to-moderate gross out humor, but on the whole, a worthwhile comedy.  I really admire Jim Carrey's rubber face; he is one gifted mugger.  Jeff Daniels was excellent as well.  They worked well together.  Plus, these guys really took Curly Howard (of the 3 Stooges) and 'ran with the ball.'",7,0,2,30 September 2002
Life Is Beautiful," Magnificent
","Italian moviemakers seem to have a knack for portraying men in a positive way.  This film is a winner, particularly in showing a believable loving bond between father and son, and no less, mother, father and son.  Like the film 'The Big Night' and several others, 'Life is Beautiful' isn't afraid to show love and caring between brothers and male friends.  How refreshing given the cardboard portrayal of men on contemporary American television and film.",10,1,2,30 April 1999
The Red Violin," a worthwhile film
","This is a good film from a number of viewpoints, including intellectual, visual and emotional, and it even has an intriguing plot line.  Effective and smooth use of flashback allows the movie great latitude.  I enjoyed it and recommend it.",9,0,0,28 January 2000
Titanic," Barf.
","Anyone who has even a glimmer of an idea of language, thought, or customs of turn-of-the-century US/Britain would be repelled by this film.  I've read a number of survivor accounts, and people just didn't THINK or TALK the way they thought and spoke in the film.  Anachronisms aside, it was, I suppose, only a love story.  But there are so many better ones that have been filmed. Titanic was to me a real disappointment.",1,22,47,18 December 1998
Titanic," Awful
","A glorified sit-com, or soap opera.  This is one big hustle; I'm told it's the best movie ever...I must be from Mars.  It's an insult to 1500 who died in 1912, an insult to women, and a patronizing film in 1998.",1,8,17,18 January 1999
Love Actually," interesting slant on politics here
","Interesting movie, kind of cute, and funny at times.  Most interesting to me was the angle of the US President vs. the Prime Minister...seemed like the director/writer wanted to make a point about US-British relations, by having the PM publicly lambaste the Prez...I wonder how this part of the movie 'sat' with British viewers?  Seems like most IMDB viewers totally missed commenting on this part of the movie.  Any thoughts on it?",6,1,2,29 November 2003
Am√©lie," Fabulous film in every way
","I loved this film...it excels in so many areas.  It's very funny, very touching, very human, very weird, very sad, very very.  When I see a film like this I wonder why Hollywood does not (or cannot) produce films of its quality ('Martha Fokker' indeed).  I guess what was best about Amelie was that is was <real>; that what she did and felt was something all people could identify in themselves:  her desire for justice, but not in the tired old legal way, but in a real, human way.  Her desire for love, not simply for herself, but for others in the world, even for those who the world sees as misfits, or as somewhat undesirable in appearance or behaviour.  I loved the film, my wife loved the film (an unusual agreement!), and we're going to see it again.",10,1,3,8 January 2002
