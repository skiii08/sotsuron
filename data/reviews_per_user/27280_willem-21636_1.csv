The Lobster," The description looked promising... but it failed to work
","A man is sent to a hotel where he has to find a mate in a few weeks time. If not, he will be transformed into an animal of his choice. That was the description I read and which made me think: 'That's an interesting idea! This could be fun!' Unfortunately, that's where the fun ended.The beginning of this movie is acceptable and still made me wonder where it was heading to. However it became more apparent with every minute that this movie was heading nowhere (sorry if that's a spoiler). Especially after the escape by the main character from the hotel the thing went from bad to worse.The scene which at an early stage crashed my hopes was the first of two scenes in which the the loners in the hotel have to watch ridiculous performances of the advantages of being together instead of alone. OK, so we have some absurdism, I was prepared for that. But this scene of having grown adults watch these scenes without some of them laughing out loud or boo-ing was totally unconvincing.From that moment the thing went completely down the hill, alternating between supposedly funny moments (ahem) and shocking scenes including disgusting cruelty towards animals.I have watched movies, which ended quite sad, but still caused me to leave the cinema in a good mood, like, 'well at least they really loved each other', or 'who knows what good will happen to them in the future'. The Lobster did none of this. By the time the movie was dragging to its insufferable long ending, I had seen the message that the director wanted to give (apparently) so many times that I had gone totally numb.The most ridiculous was the scene where the loners in the wood (they are depicted like a kind of para military group in this society of couples) speak to their spy in the hotel. Suddenly they start to talk in French. It actually reminded me of Allo Allo (Michelle: 'Now listen carefully, I will say zis only whence'). It would have been funny except that at this time I was more concerned with my mobile phone keeping track of the time and waiting for the monster to end.Now I know that movies are not made to please me but honestly, this is piece of garbage. Sorry if I'm repeating myself but so does The Lobster, over and over and over again.The only reason I give it 2 stars out of 10 is the acting which is OK although I wondered why these actors lowered themselves to this level.",2,41,71,8 January 2016
