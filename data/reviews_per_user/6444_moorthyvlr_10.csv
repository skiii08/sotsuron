The Avengers," Marginally short of Extra expectation
","Compared to Captain America or Iron man the quality of suspense, heroism, the definition of a soldier is not there in this movie.Though the action element is incredible, there is noticeable lack of spirit.'Transformers' or 'The rise of cobra' or 'Battle LA' or even JL movies exhibit a thrill which would make one to feel the battle of survival. Plot is very predictable and the lack of mystery makes it even worse.For those people who have watched similar team effort crisis control by a bunch of supers as in JL there is always an extra expectation, should understand that in Avengers, except for Thor and Loki, the others are only highly skilled or enhanced human beings. Having said all this I still have given an 8 because it is still a Marvel. The visuals the combats and the policy of equal footing for all Heroes, made the movie worth its money.",8,2,6,1 May 2012
The Expendables 2," Pathetic
","This movie fails in almost everything that is there to fail. Nothing that can thought as original as everything is big mash up served to upset people. When there are too many heroes it does not mean there cannot be any co-ordinated team work. They wasted lot of film just to give entry. The story is very predictable and pretty much compromised for some petty bloody action sequences. People who might have given such high ratings would have fallen victim for the cheesy dialogs and the reminiscence of the old movie dialogs.Compared to the first movie this movie villains are duds and heroes are more or less bloody comedians.In one word this movie can never be called as action movie. It is like a parody.I only wish if they have modified the story with some original dialogs with interesting plot and a notorious evil genius as villain who treats everyone as expendables to reach his vision to be stopped by this rag bag team of mercenaries. But this was just bang,boom,slash where only heroes weapons are activated and villains are merely target practice. Even if you want to salute these old heroic actors don't waste your money on this one it will simply make them worthless. However all the above is only my opinion.",2,37,60,27 August 2012
Skyfall," Skyfall-----___Downfall
","First thing I would say is, this movie is way too lengthy. I am really surprised to see a movie whose production is estimated as 150 million dollars is this bad. There are risky action sequences, good twists and turns but the real problem is, there are plenty of loop holes in the plot. It would be great feat if one saw this entire movie as I saw many Bond lovers and normal people leave this movie in the middle. I sat and saw till the end to get the complete picture which was way below my expectations. For this plot my expectation is simply making one understand the definition of 00 status. The level of risk involved in the operation of these agents and the tough choices that their superiors had to take to keep it under control. The concentration and effort should have been given on that. This movie portrays an aged MI6 agency,their pride, ridiculous emotional bonds, sloppy bond partners, no snappy gadgets. Even the usual dialogues of name introduction or the order of the vodka martini is poorly executed. so much for minute detail. I would have given 1 star but gave it 3 stars because they tried something different.",3,14,33,5 November 2012
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Definition of Rebel
","A small single dialogue in Stars war movie 4 'The Phantom Menace' is a whole movie. Only those who have watched the star war movie series can truly understand the value of this movie. This movie is well balanced in many aspects. Even if someone who is new to star wars watches this movie, it will be intriguing to watch all the other ones. The action sequence, the story momentum is brisk till the very end. The way in which everyone and everything was connected was fantastic to watch. The chain of events the shown to achieve a success is a team play. All this was expertly interlinked and connected to sew the wonderful masterpiece. I gave it an 8 as it was close to perfection. I recommend this to ones who wanted to view very different kind of Star wars movie.",8,1,5,26 January 2017
The Adventures of Tintin," Did not reach my expectation
",I went to see this movie expecting to see the unveiling of Tintin in 3d. The visuals were fantastic. Still a lot of effort is needed to get the attention to explore the world of Tintin.Tintin is a very popular comics. They have also made animation series and few movies. In the 3d era the expectations are always high.The messed up part is the blending of other stories in the singular plot. There were some innovations but messing up with villain character is not wise.The story would have gone well if concentration was given to the basic plot and its corresponding story and made improvisation on the details.That would have been my expectation.,6,12,21,16 November 2011
Avengers: Endgame," Unsnap
","When I saw Infinity wars I knew the next movie will deal with unsnaping and the defeat of Thanos. After a year of waiting I saw the movie like everybody else.
The sense of loss and of losing someone is tremendous both aspects are very different from comic books storylines, but for a movie it is important. In this movie the action, pace, and exuberance of supers is very less and slow. The concentration was given to human emotions, hopelessness and consequent coping to hard reality. However, few things I would avoided in scripting would the way in which they solved the problem and the credibility of the description of such powerful stones. Mysterious soul stone, its layer, reason for sacrifice all has meaning except for the convenience of the plot. Time stone description in Dr.Strange has no role either. This entire movie fooled everyone by think stones have tremendous possibilities but it was just meant for the plot. That was disappointing.
However it is master piece considering the way in which it was made. If I had to analyze and nitpick all the plot holes it would be full of spoilers.
So I would say watch the movie and enjoy the epic conclusions.",8,1,2,6 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Well Scripted
","So many movies were made before this title. Connecting them all and binding them is remarkable...then to make the audience think question what happens in the next movie!...that's gold sensational...
This movie is done so well that it is plotted for its sequels...I would say the enitire movie infinty war ends like anyother movie's inmtermission phase...The difference is we have wait till they screen the sequel...Sad thing for was the way they have pictured HULK..,but it was intelligently prepared if you seen Ragnarok...Thanos the mad titan is really strongly convinced with his ideals...but his ideals is questionably stupid. Thor's character from his earlier movies of being a hot headed barbarian to the rise of godliness is well put in this movie. 
Gaurdian of Galaxy guys...the all had improtant roles to play..especially Groot and Gamora. I would recommend this movies to other but after watching a Marathon of all the movies earlier. Only that can bring out complete enjoyment of this movie.",8,1,3,13 May 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Twists
","This is not as good as the first movie but it was enjoyable. Visuals are worthy to watch in a imax 3d screen. Humour, Action, Romance, Mystery in one package. Villain character was boring, stupid....in one word a complete moron...villain are meant to be villainous, vicious, selfish to the core not like a half baked cup cake. The role of Yondu was fun and brought life to this movie. Baby Groot is a typical character whose place changed the tempo of the movie. In this movie there is not much to say about plot but they way it was expressed is what it fetched the 8 points. This movie can be enjoyed in both 2d and 3d formats. I would suggest to watch in IMAX 3d.",8,0,3,17 May 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," It is only a movie...
","'Batman Begins' is the best batman movie ever taken. It re-introduced Batman on the big screen.'The dark knight' as for me is fall, it portrayed the height of a mad villain. But Batman is ruthless and feared hero. Almost all the time he has something better under his sleeves to turn the tables.This movie 'The dark night rises' is actually portraying a sloppy Batman. The movie is wonderful but lot of snags in the storyline. On a pure entertainment basis it will score 10. But people who have taste based on the depth of the story it is still lagging.In the books of Batman no matter how tough and smart the enemy is, Batman way too smart and feared by them. I have given a 7 because it has some mind blowing action sequences. As i said before it is only a movie don't get too logical it will kill fun out of it.",7,3,7,30 July 2012
Deadpool," Dead pool...Violence
","Is this a super hero movie? Well yes in a way that Deadpool cannot be killed. Is this meant for kids? No. It is more violent with adult scenes and nasty jokes. For Super hero movie it more of super vengeance movie of a character taken from the movie 'Good,Bad and Ugly' having the traits of all the three. X-men are comedians and Deadpool is originally a human. If I were to give a presentation of the movie it will end in three slides. Slide 1 introduction, Slide 2 Romance and Terminal Disease, Slide 3 Betrayal and vengeance. But then presentation of this movie is very good. With little content they made a good movie. For me a movie should have more content with good presentation of course. I wont call this movie as bad but the expectation after seeing the trailers were very higher. In the end trailers alone was enough for this movie. If you have seen all the trailers then you don't require to see the movie to spoil your imaginations as there is nothing more impressive to it.",5,3,22,23 February 2016
