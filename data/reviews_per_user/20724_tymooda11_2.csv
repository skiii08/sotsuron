Gremlins," What a blast!
","Joe Dante's 'Gremlins' is an absolutely, amazingly fun time. The concept of the Gremlins themselves being so intriguing and fun, and face it, Gizmo is one of the cutest creatures in cinema history. While this movies first 20 minutes are a bit boring, once the story and absolute fun insanity begins you'll be having such a good time that the run time of the film will completely slip by. I have loved this film since a young age, and sure it may be nostalgia, but god do I really love this movie. I highly recommend watching this on a cold winter night, with hot chocolate, and a warm bowl of popcorn. I guarantee that you will have a fun time with this. It's not a thought provoking film, it won't change your life, but it is a fun ride , completely worth it's length",9,9,10,21 January 2017
The Wizard of Oz," Sucks bigger butt than Drake sucking Nicki Minaj
","This movie stunk of stinkers throughout the the entire film 10/10 5 stars, go watch on vinyl today. You see through out my entire life i loved the movie Jakobos Magic Mumbos, so i just knew that this movie would SUCK MAJOR Awesome, it sucked the awesome out of everything, this film is so well done i just HAVE to throw up every time i see it playing, my eyes barf as well. So as you can see this is an Excellent film directed by Micheal Phelps, and starring actors such as, George A. Romero playing the wonderful Dorothy, and Todo being played by Adam Sandman. If you want a fun time then steer clear of this travesty, train wreck of a film. This was reviewer Brucle Wonka, Have a nice day",10,2,9,7 January 2015
