The Blair Witch Project," That's It?
","I had two friends that raved about this movie. The movie theater was selling out all the shows. After seeing it and reading the reviews I have come to the conclusion that you will either love this movie or hate it.Hate is a strong word for me, but I definitely was not scared at any time. I admit, for a very low budget film and no-name actors it was done very well, but I would never call it 'the scariest movie ever' or 'a masterpiece.' It would have made an interesting rental, but I would still wonder why people raved over it.The camera work is very shaky which made my friends sick. The plot dragged on until over halfway through the movie, and even then not all that much happens. The ending leaves you saying - 'What happened?' and NOTHING is explained.I heard a lot of people boo when it was over, and others complaining as we left the theater.I was looking forward to a great scare. I probably would have got more out of seeing 'Lake Placid.'",Null,0,1,23 July 1999
The Matrix," A Stylish Shoot-Em-Up
","Don't expect deep meaning. Don't try to logically figure it out - the more you do the sillier it gets. Just sit back and enjoy this piece of visual eye-candy.Keanu Reeves actually does an adequate job, which is a lot for him. The special effects are pretty amazing. This should set the standard for the next big super-hero movie.The film makers were definitely going for a Hong Kong/Japanese look to the film, and I think that's a wise move. Today's audiences are looking for larger than life action films with some style and an edge, and the film works great on that level.So far it's my favorite movie of 1999 because it was better than I expected. It's been a while since a movie did that.",Null,0,0,23 July 1999
