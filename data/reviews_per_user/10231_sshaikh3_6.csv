The Blair Witch Project," waste
",I wonder why people are making such a big hype for this movie it's really boring and it's not scary at all and it is so difficult to understand what's going on in this movie where's the witch where's the scare one wonders after watching 39 minutes of the first movie with simply mindless dialogue of these three friends arguing with each other i almost gave up but wanted to keep watching because people said such good things about this movie i was expecting something along the lines of Eli Roth's cabin fever but this was depressing even the money and the marketing that went into this movie is a waste it's not even much of a movie or at least it's not shot in that format for those of you who don't believe me watch it for yourself it's not satisfying.,1,9,16,6 October 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," a little advancement in part on the movies
",Finished watching this movie for the first in an imax theatre or maybe they all are anyways the movie did its best to be honest to the book still steve kloves can't help but jump around as many scenes as he can even though the movie is 2 and a half hours long and the screenplay by steve kloves is good he should focus more time and effort acting was a s good as usual and of course laughs flying around the theatre whenever rupert grint would crack a funny one it also has some mature scenes of advancement such as hermione and harry dancing in the tent and when ron is trying to destroy the horcrux and in that horcrux he sees his worst fears it was definitely a good time in the theatre the movie does seem to slow down a little on certain scenes and then rush on others but im a die-hard harry potter fan and it was worth the trouble to get to see this movie,8,0,0,20 November 2010
The Usual Suspects," A movie you definitely couldn't see just once
",It truly is an amazing movie after watching it you will feel you want to watch it all over again get haunted by the same scenes understand those scenes which form this movie into a puzzle of a thriller even though this story is supposed to explain what happened on a boat it slowly turns into a story about a criminal mastermind Keyser Soze who could be behind the chaos that happened at that boat but the really great thing is that he is a legend a spook story but something that is mentioned throughout the movie with the possibility of existing Kevin Spacey is really great in his role Direction by Bryan Singer is also good most of the actors although experienced look like jokers compared to Kevin Spacey and Chazz Palminetri otherwise it is a really good movie and if you haven't seen it then you haven't seen a mive which truly is the definition of a thriller.,9,0,0,30 May 2009
The Dark Knight," A little extreme but very good
",When you watch this movie it succeeds in not disappointing you thanks mainly to Heath Ledger's performance he simply brings life to his ever acclaimed character the joker Christian Bale is also good as well as many other actors it is really the stunning script from the Nolan brothers and of course the superb direction of Christopher Nolan although I have to say this movie is too heavy in emotions and it also has one fatal flaw which apparently all successful batman movies have the inner conflict that the character the superhero faces within himself that has got to stop in these movies then it would be really good overall you have to admit there is movie like this one.,9,0,3,15 April 2009
Pulp Fiction," dunno why i didn't like this movie at first
",This in my opinion is the best Quentin Tarantino movie ever I have to admit I don't know what was wrong with me that I didn't like this movie at first really don't know what was wrong with me maybe the scenes are slowly detailed but this movie has the best dialogues a really good concept people like the simplicity of this movie that is why this is so good and it's emphasis alone on dialogues and the fact that this movie was made in a really simple time Quentin Tarantino with his best friend Roger Avary managed to do something different something new which makes this movie far better than Kill Bill Vol.1 or Reservoir Dogs those movies don't have what Pulp Fiction has that is why this movie is so good.,9,1,2,17 June 2009
Titanic," pretty good
",I saw this movie last night on tbs and I have to say I was impressedthroughout my lifetime i never gave this movie a chance I always had the DVD lying there and eventually I moved I would see my mom watching it when I was 5 years old which is when it came out I have to admit the hype around this movie is acceptable finally last night thoughi kept watching it till the end both actors Caprio and Winslethave done a great job it's even pretty touching in some parts amazinghow much money went into making this movie it was worth it thedirection the epic scenes of watching Winslet and Caprio trying to survive throughout the whole ordeal was fun to watch I highly recommend this movie to those who haven't seen it.,8,1,2,26 September 2010
