The Avengers," I expected more...
","I expected a lot more from a movie with such high ratings. First of all, right from the first scene I did not understand what was going on. Also, this movie had way, way too much talk, and I couldn't even understand or hear what they were saying. I almost yelled at the movie screen for them to speak clearly. All these random things started happening, and I began to lose track of the storyline. As a result, I fell asleep. The first movie I have ever fallen asleep during, and it was the Avengers. When I woke up, it was the last fighting scene. The same thing seemed to keep happening over and over again, so it wasn't really that exciting. The only thing I got out of that movie was some of Hulk's jokes, which were pretty funny, and Iron Man makes you laugh too sometimes. Other than that, it was only OK. Maybe it's just that I don't like super heroes that much, but I did expect a lot more.",5,3,17,8 July 2012
Despicable Me," Funny in its own charming way!
","This movie is one of my favorites of all time, even though I'm only 13 years old (I love movies; I watch at least a new one every day during the summer! Don't try that at home.). Some of the jokes are a bit childish, but I found myself laughing at those the hardest. The characters are lovable and cute, but the plot is not very original, and that is why I did not give it 10 stars. However, this movie keeps you smiling, and very few movies nowadays are able to do that. I am constantly quoting lines from this film, and searching up my favorite scenes on YouTube. An excellent lesson, cute characters, and humorous jokes are what make this movie what it is - AWESOME! And definitely worth your time!",9,1,1,13 June 2012
