Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," My long suffering has ended ...very positively !!
","Ok I gave this movie 9 / 10 .Ok I'll quickly tell you what took that little point away from  excellent. I really liked the movie fabulous ,i really was saddened when I heard TV and radios saying that the movie wasn't such a big hit. I entered the cinema hoping to spend what little cash I had with myself well enuff. At the end i was really satisfied , a really well spent time and money .I really liked Ewan McGregor's version of young Obi-wan ,and really liked Qui-gonn Jinn played by liam Neeson .Especially at the beginning when they light their sabres in a poison filled room . That shot was incredible.From then on I was really entertained , till I heard again those Incredible words that I heard when I was a kid , ' concentrate on the moment ...and let the force be with you ' . At that point had I not controlled myself I would have jumped up and screamed 'YAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEEEH' Most of the FX were really well done ( but too clean ..explain later)I liked them ( but very strangely I preferred the ones in the first trilogy ) .Then came the fighting scenes , really fabulous, I liked them more than the ones between Luke and Vader in the first trilogy , really nicely setup.Jar Jar Binks is a character who is inevitable in these movies and I'd also say quite useful to make the movie more enjoyable to a younger audience.So I'll abstain from judging him .Now comes the question of the computer grafix ( CG ) .... I did enjoy the movie ,really well done in all aspects but in the end what the first trilogy had ,but I missed in this movie, was the crudeness of the first movies which resulted to me more realistic than this very clean version.The first movie displayed ships that were visibly , imperfect  , dirty .Here everything  is perfect like the Gungan city or the underwater lifeforms.Everything a bit too perfect .Even the fighter droids looked a bit too delicate to me .The gungan race a really nice idea but still too perfect.There is this small difference still , for me, between reality and what computer grafix can accomplish .Anyway great movie , and a good way to start this new trilogy !! Recommended to everyone !!",9,7,9,23 July 1999
The Big Lebowski," One of my favorites ...all time classic to be
","Well , when i first saw it I missed many parts or little details which made this masterpiece so much funnier , the characters introduced are so unique and original I was really impressed.. Maybe because this was my first Coen/Coen movie it hit me hard.Dude Lebowski is so lazy that at certain points he can't even think what to say so he copies what George Bush says ,or writes a check for less than a dollar..?This movie in a way makes fun of Jews , Italians , Poles , Germans ,Swedes ,Greeks , Mexicans but not in a vulgar way .I really loved the attitude 'the dude ' had when someone broke into his house smashing the door while he was smoking pot in his bathtub ...' hey this is a private apartment ..' Or the fact that he drank everyday about at least 3 white russians.Then in comes Sobczak , the dude's buddy and bowl mate .This guy is absolutely played fabulously by John Goodman . He is so fixated about rules and these  'rules' have been fought for by himself and so many other ' good guys ..in Nam ' . This fixation is so strong that at a certain point he points a gun at a bowling contestant because he went ' over the line ' but claimed otherwise .Or the fact that he argues with ' autobahn ' nihilists that ' these are not the rules  ! ...without a hostage there is no ransom '.Anyway simply the idea of introducing a character like Sobczak who is a pole who was in Vietnam , lives in the states and pretends he's Jewish (because his ex-wife was ) but really is a catholic  is absolutely hilarious to me..All the characters in this movie are worth mentioning but space runs out !I'd conclude that this movie is a rare type of low budget , non-Hollywood-mega-project movie that to me is at a higher level than many action-packed , super-fx ,multimillionaire movies that are coming out these days . I'll certainly look out for more Coen movies...",10,0,1,23 July 1999
