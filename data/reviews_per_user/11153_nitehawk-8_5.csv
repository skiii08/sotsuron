The Blair Witch Project," Brilliant film-making..
","First of all, I would like to say to all the people who absolutely hated this movie and gave it a 1 out of 10, YOU HAVE NO VISION. Whoever you are... you have no creativity, and your mind is about as open as the gate to Area 51. But then again, we're all entitled to our own opinions, right? ;)This movie broke all the rules. Those who went to see it expecting chainsaws and gore or things suddenly leaping out at people are in for a surprise. I'm not saying movies like the Alien series or Scream, etc., aren't good... Blair Witch just has a completely different way of scaring you. The movie starts out humorous, with three film students setting off to research and report on a legend in a small town, and slowly grows more ominous with each passing minute. If you are actually willing to really WATCH this movie (and not immediately brush it off because of its initial appearance), you'll end up feeling more subtly disturbed afterwards than you may have thought upon going in. Most of my friends, people that have pretty much seen everything, well.... Let's just say that the average psychological disturbance for them was at least 2 days without any sleep. Same for me. The person I went with is rarely scared by anything, and he was white as a sheet during the last half of the movie (I was afraid to drive home alone after it, too!). There were a few days at work where everyone was grouchy and miserable from lack of sleep (most of us had seen it around the same time), but it was a GOOD lack of sleep... ;)So there. I've either convinced you into seeing it for its genius or scared you into NEVER seeing it (sorry)... And if I say any more, I'll totally ruin it for you!Blair Witch should at least receive an award for Original Screenplay this year, if nothing else. Good luck Mr. Myrick and Mr. Sanchez, thanks for the adrenaline-filled ride! (10/10)",10,1,2,8 September 1999

Dark City," I think Alex Proyas had a stroke of genius in the making of this movie. One of the most original dark sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time.
","John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in an eerie hotel, naked and in the bathtub, with no memories and blood on his forehead. (I couldn't imagine a more strange and frightening experience.) The ring of the hotel phone breaks the silence-- a strange man on the other end tells him he must leave because there are people looking for him. Many events such as this one unfold in Dark City, where 'man has no past... and humanity has no future'.Dark City has been passed over by so many critics it's depressing. I think that it should at least have been up for 'original screenplay' or SOMETHING at the Oscars to reward Alex Proyas for his fantastic vision. I fail to see why so many people label this movie 'noir' like it's BAD or something. Being dark and twisted is not a crime, and despite some other people's comments, this movie is NOT just for the trenchcoat-wearing masses (or if it is, maybe the rest of you can learn something from Goths). If you like sci-fi, dark plots and having reality be so well distorted that you don't realize it IS, so you will love Dark City. (People who have seen the Matrix BEFORE this movie MUST see it, it is very similar in these three respects).I gave it a 9 out of 10 ONLY because I thought the ending fight scene was a bit weak. Great for a fight scene, but because the rest of the movie focuses on John Murdoch's quest to discover his past and the eerie, ominous happenings in the city, the climax seemed hastily thrown together, as if the crew all of a sudden remembered they had a deadline to meet and could no longer continue the plot in the previous fashion.The visuals in this movie were absolutely stunning. The effects were NOT used to substitute for the plot, like other movies such as Starship Troopers, Lost in Space and Alien: Resurrection. They were used only as needed and were breathtaking. The editing is NOT as choppy as is rumored, it only lends to the power of the movie. There are some heart-stopping images in Dark City. Watch for the Strangers' clock, views of the city and John's memories.Proyas takes ideas and ambience from many other movies but integrates them all neatly into Dark City. Gotham City is clearly seen as is Metropolis and other influences such as Ed Hopper's 'Nighthawks' dominate in the diner scenes. The forty-ish era (yet strangely futuristic) city is known to be populated, and yet it is ominously empty (hence one of Hopper's main themes, isolation in large cities). (It's especially quiet at midnight, hehehehe... ;D ) This 40's era ambience together with the sci-fi fantasy undercurrent makes for a very interesting feeling while watching.I'm happy that Kiefer Sutherland, Richard O'Brien (of Rocky Horror fame) and William Hurt agreed to do this movie, it gave Dark City just that much more validation in the USA (I wish things weren't like this, but they are). Kiefer Sutherland is absolutely wonderful and convincing as the doctor/scientist Dr.Schreber, and Rufus Sewell is a properly confused yet determined John Murdoch. Many critics say that William Hurt's character, the detective, and Jennifer Connelly's Emma Murdoch could have used a little more development, but I think part of the point of Dark City was that you don't really know who people are (not to mention yourself). Richard O'Brien and his character's whole race creep me out every time I see the movie, but he's especially frightening and a strange character. I had to resist the urge to talk like a Stranger after seeing the movie a few times.Trevor Jones, one of my favorite movie composers, did the score for Dark City, and I must say it's very apropo. The deep, bass vocals and frantic themes are some of my favorite aspects, but 'Memories of Shell Beach' is a haunting, beautiful song as well. Some of my other favorite scores by him are the Dark Crystal and Last of the Mohicans.Altogether, I think Alex Proyas had a stroke of genius in the making of this movie. One of the most original dark sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time. It deserves its place with the Matrix, 12 Monkeys and others, pioneers in a field so changed (usually for the worse) since Star Wars and since earlier sci-fi classics. I hope these won't be the last of a (dare I say it?) dying race of movies that have true creativity and originality.",9,416,473,15 June 1999
The Game," Intense psychological thriller...
","This movie should have been called Paranoia Incorporated... THE GAME was an incredibly intense psychological thriller, one that keeps you guessing at what's real and what's not. Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), a wealthy investment banker but a miserable human being, receives a gift from his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) on his birthday ('for the man who has everything'). The 'game' that Van Orton becomes involved in consumes every aspect of his life and quickly starts to become nightmarish.Sparingly advertised or critiqued, this movie was very underrated, and was absolutely the best mystery/thriller I have ever seen. At once you think you know everything that is happening and that is going to happen... but you're in for quite a surprise. The reality of THE GAME changes over and over and you are put in Van Orton's place as you try to figure out what's really going on. I give this movie 9 out of 10. I bought this movie as well, and even though I know what the story is, I still like to imagine what I would do in each situation (plus, if I've invited someone over to watch it for the first time, I love to see their reaction as their predictions are repeatedly dashed to pieces). The ending is nervewracking and insane (in a good way, of course), you will be shocked by it. This is also my favorite movie starring Michael Douglas, he is wonderful in it, and all the other characters are believable and well acted. David Fincher has done well with this movie as a successor to Alien 3 and Se7en, he is the paranoia king!",10,0,1,22 June 1999
The Sixth Sense," Great acting, but see Blair Witch if you want a scare...
","I recently saw this movie after many of my friends and acquaintances showered it with compliments. Keep in mind that this is after I've already seen Blair Witch, which was incredible (not to mention terrifying).
The Sixth Sense's shining star (say that 5 times fast) was Haley Joel Osment, who played a leading role as Cole Sear. This young actor is BRILLIANT. It always gets me when certain children can grasp the rules of the stage so easily. I was stunned by his incredible performance as the troubled boy, Cole Sear, who 'sees dead people' and who is passed off as schizophrenic or delusional. He can trust no psychologist, and his paranoia has many reasons.An award-winning psychologist, however, slowly wins this boy's trust. Bruce Willis, playing Dr. Malcolm Crowe, actually surprised me in the nature of his performance. Yes, we all know Bruce Willis as the blood-and-grime-streaked action hero-- but in The Sixth Sense, he is uncharacteristically good as this very caring psychologist, who is marred by a terrible tragedy. (I cannot reveal what this is or I'd spoil an important part of the movie.)Malcolm is so dedicated to his work as a child psychologist that he begins to forget about spending time with his wife, and having a life of his own again. This may seem trite and overdone in most movies, but is a serious problem in real life and is portrayed fairly well here. Cole must convince Malcolm to help him (believing Malcolm is the only one who will be able to rid him of the ghosts) but this forces Dr. Crowe to decide between his work with Cole... or his own family.M. Night Shyamalan did well with the plot in that it hasn't been done much before, but the movie absolutely did not succeed in being scary (if that was his intent). It was so utterly obvious when something frightening was going to happen, because the music would increase in volume up until the event for somewhere around a whole minute. It wasn't even FUNNY, like in Scream. I do usually like James Newton Howard's scores; ER, The Fugitive and Flatliners are wonderful, but I guess it's not really his fault he had to do some of the things he did in Sixth Sense. This blatant, failed attempt at suspense totally brought my rating of this movie down, just because it was so overdone. There were a few tear-jerking minutes in the movie, and the ending was actually a little surprising (the ONLY suspenseful part in the movie). There's a big 'yeah, right' factor in certain parts as well, think about it if you've seen the movie. Overall though, I'd say it was a fairly good movie, especially because of young Mr. Osment. He is destined for great things... I'd rate this movie a 7 out of 10.",8,0,0,25 August 1999
