10 Cloverfield Lane," Chappy Watched: 10 Cloverfield Lane
","Before even talking about the movie, massive kudos have to go to everyone involved in the making of this film for keeping it completely secret. Just the fact that nothing at all was leaked until the release of the trailer is completely flabbergasting, all those people involved and nothing.Also to have one teaser trailer released such a short time before the movie was released in cinemas added to the shock and suspense of the film.Now about the film.It's brilliant. I originally planned to watch Cloverfield before seeing this but I didn't get around to it but after seeing this film, you don't actually need to. It's ultimately a brand name with different films under its banner.It has a brilliant cast, which shouldn't be hard considering the case consists of only three people. John Goodman absolutely steals focus and is brilliant in every scene he is in!I didn't realize until the credits started rolling, just how tense I was when I instantly felt the relief of letting myself relax. It's definitely a thriller with twists and turns up until the very end.Don't go into this film expecting a sequel to Cloverfield, you will be disappointed. This is an amazing film, maybe even one of the best of 2016!",7,2,5,28 May 2016
The Expendables 2," Chappy Watched: The Expendables Trilogy
","First of all, if you go into this film expecting anything but a slapstick look at all the old action heroes, well you will severely disappointed.You have your core group of 6 characters that are the main group (Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews and Randy Couture) and then after that, every movie, is more like a game of spot the celebrity.The highlight of celebrity appearances would by far have to be Chuck Norris, complete with his own background music – all that was missing was the tumbleweed blowing across the street!All 3 films are full of puns, quotes and jokes about some of the past works of the actors.The first Expendables has too much story and drama and not a lot of action until the end of the film. Expendables 2 was the best out of the trilogy, starts the action straight away and Expendables 3 was probably the worst out of the three.The third film seemed more like a casting video, with Stallone travelling around and getting new, younger people for his team. I also found some of the scenes, especially with Mel Gibson, didn't need to be in the movie and wasn't necessary to the storyline including his character buying art and walking up the stairs to his house.All three films are worth at least a watch once; with #2 being the only one I would watch again.",5,0,0,10 May 2016
The Maze Runner," Chappy Watched: The Maze Runner
","So I got tickets to an advanced screening of this film and I fully expected to have it full of teenagers screaming over Teen Wolf star, Dylan O'Brien.I walked in to the cinemas; the line was huge and full of teenagers. CRAP! Finally got my tickets and then found out that all these teenagers were going to see the new Step Up movie. YES!!! I had heard about the movie and when I found out that it was going to appear at WonderCon this year, I got a copy of the book. I only got about 100 pages or so in – not to any fault of the books! – and then just never picked it up again.I really, really enjoyed this movie. I had heard a lot of criticism that this was just another Hunger Games. I actually found it to be more like Lord of the Flies than Hunger Games.If you couldn't tell from the trailers or the advertising, this story pretty much revolves around Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and starts straight from the beginning of his time in 'The Glade'.The Glade is very well done, it looks like it has been built by humans with very little equipment and not made unrealistic by CGI. The Maze is also very well done, simple, built for it's purpose and looks real and doesn't try to be over creative.If anyone is going to make it out of Teen Wolf and succeed, it's going to be O'Brien. I have stopped watching the show but his character of 'Stiles' is what got me watching the show in the beginning and is what kept me watching as long as I did! The character of Stiles is, more often than not, the comedy relief of the show, with his uncoordinated movements but the character of Thomas is essentially quite the opposite.The cast was pretty awesome, not a lot of them are well known but doesn't show in this movie and while Thomas may be the headliner, the heart of the movie, even though with a smaller role would definitely have to be Chuck, played by Blake Cooper.There seems to be an inkling of a possible future romance between Thomas and Teresa, the only female sent to The Maze, but I didn't feel any chemistry between the two other than a brother/sister relationship.This movie is based on a book series and while it wraps up 'The Maze Runner' chapter, it does leave some aspects and story lines open for the future films.There better be future films!I really enjoyed this film more than I thought I would and will more than likely go see it again, probably even buy it on blu-ray when it's released.",7,0,1,28 May 2016
World War Z," Chappy Watched: World War Z
","This may very well be my favourite zombie movie.The story starts pretty much straight away, doesn't waste too much time trying to explain how and why and by the end of the movie, isn't entirely wrapped up in a pretty bow.Brad Pitt is obviously the main lead in this film and a major Hollywood actor but I didn't feel like that was thrown in our face with close-ups and flashy scenes.Aside from Brad Pitt, James Badge Dale (Iron Man 3), Peter Capaldi (Doctor Who), Ruth Negga (Raina from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D) and Mireille Enos (The Killing) round out a good cast.The two kids annoyed the crap out of me, always yelling and running away and thankfully they weren't in the movie a lot.I really liked that the zombies looked more like human than decayed brain dead meat sacks. These zombies could also run and get in things (cars and doors) instead of being slow and useless.I watched this movie with my Mum and when it got to the part of the movie where they discover that people with life-threatening illnesses are of no interest to the zombies, who only want healthy hosts, Mum turned to me and said'I wonder if MS (Multiple Sclerosis) is enough to save me. You're dead but I could survive.'My Mother, ladies and gentlemen! Feelin' the love!An awesome movie that's worth repeat viewing and even owning.",7,0,0,7 May 2016
Zootopia," Chappy Watched: Zootopia
","It has gotten to the point where I don't even really need to know what the film is about. If it's a Disney film, I feel pretty safe going to watch it.But this time, I knew about the story of Zootopia and was excited to see it. I was not let down.I love that the animation in these Disney movies is always top notch, full of detail down to the smallest things including hairs and scars, vibrant, beautiful colours and the voicing talents is always amazing; you might not know the actors but they always seem to fit the roles.The story is brilliant as usual – an entertaining buddy cop comedy with a little drama thrown in - funny and full of emotion, both for adults and for kids, something Disney seems to do with all of their movies flawlessly.If you love all the previous Disney movies, chances are you're going to love this!",8,5,9,27 June 2016

Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Chappy Watched: Captain America - The Winter Soldier
","Wow! Sh*t went down in this movie!Never really been a fan of Captain America, he would be medium to low on my ladder of Marvel characters but these movies are pretty awesome!One of the things that I love most about all these (Marvel Studios/Disney) movies is all the little name drops and hints to the Marvel Universe that are dropped all the time.Something that is always in the back of my mind when Cap is down and out, where are the Avengers? Black Widow is obviously in it and obviously you aren't going to have them all together in a non-Avengers movie but it's always this little thing nagging at the back of your mind when the lead character is in trouble.I really liked the addition of Sam Wilson aka The Falcon to the team in this movie, looking forward to seeing more of him in future Marvel movies, as well as the rest of the cast but goody two shoes Captain America was something that kind of started to get on my nerves.At this point as we head towards the end of Phase Two, I feel pretty safe and confident watching these movies. There are still levels of good and bad but even with the bad they are still good movies to watch.A great cast with a great story that will obviously have a ripple effect through the movies and TV shows.If you have watched the other part of MCU than you will probably already have seen this but if you haven't – it's definitely worth a watch.Already have my copy on its way from Amazon.",7,0,1,28 May 2016
Southpaw," Chappy Watched: Southpaw
","I was slightly interested in seeing this film but was apprehensive about seeing it in the cinemas because it looked like such a depressing movie.I did end up seeing it in the cinemas but I'm glad to say that's it not a depressing as I thought it was going to be.Don't get me wrong; there are pretty much no happy moments in this film. Something happens pretty early in the beginning, it's pretty much just a sad fest for the rest of the film.Having said that, it still is a good film. The fight scenes look authentic and real, it's brilliantly acted by some of movies biggest hitters and gets better when Forest Whitaker appears.While it is predictable, it was still an entertaining watch.CHAPPY THINKS you should strap on your boxing gloves, boys and girls, because this is going to be one hard-hitting film! (See what I did there!)",6,1,1,26 March 2016
Ant-Man," Chappy Watched: Ant-Man
","I'm still trying to decide where to place this movie in my Top 3 MCU movies but it's definitely up there with Captain America: Winter Soldier and Guardians Of The Galaxy.I knew an average amount about Ant-Man, more than I did Guardians, but I feel pretty safe with Disney/Marvel to go in relatively blind.I did not leave that cinema disappointed!Probably one of the things I love best about the MCU is that it all looks real, the costumes aren't over the top; they look practical and let's be honest; a movie about a guy who can shrink himself and telepathically control ants could have been made into a joke but it really wasn't. The size play was flawless, detailed and didn't get too much to handle.The cast was awesome but Michael Pena was a stand out for me with his hilarious retelling of the tipoffs he received and I was a little apprehensive about Paul Rudd, I thought he was going to turn the comedy stupid and go over the top but it had a nice balance of funny and serious.Loved the cameos including of course, Stan Lee, loved the mention of what happened in Avengers: Age of Ultron, little bread crumbs for future Ant-Man films and even a little nod to a certain web slinger!I would be interested to read or hear how this movie differed from Edgar Wright's version of the film but they still managed to move past all that drama and make a brilliant movie.Loved this, will see it again in the cinemas, buy it on blu-ray on Day 1 and will be eagerly waiting for, hopefully, some sequels!If you are a fan of the MCU, go see this!PLEASE NOTE: There is a mid credits scene AND an after credits scene!",9,0,1,27 March 2016
Divergent," Chappy Watched: Divergent
","This actually wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.What would have made this movie better? Getting rid of the teen romance storyline.It's a good concept but I just feel like they are forcing this romance on us, which sucks because it didn't feel like they had any chemistry at all.Kate Winslet, Ashley Judd and Maggie Q were definitely highlights of the film for me. I was excited when I learnt Maggie Q was in it but then disappointed when she was barely even in it, hopefully she will have a bigger role in the sequels.I'm undecided if I would watch the other films, if I do it definitely won't be in the cinemas.",5,0,0,27 March 2016
Ender's Game," Chappy Watched: Ender's Game
","After watching this, I'm disappointed that I left it this long to watch it!I was hooked straight from the beginning and all the way until the very end!The cast is definitely a big chunk of that. Both the older and younger cast members brought their A games and all gave awesome performances all the way through. Harrison Ford, Ben Kinsley and Viola Davis were brilliant as was Asa Butterfield.The story was another part; it was pretty much instantly captivating and had me completely absorbed and hanging on every thread. The story itself was entertaining, good for the whole family and details what happened to get where the film starts quickly without spending too much time dwelling on it.The special effects were stunning throughout and visually beautiful with a technical, and what I think, is a realistic look at what the future may entail.Without giving too much away, the ending wasn't what I expected but in a good way. It does with the feeling that there is supposed to be more but doesn't leave us hanging if there isn't – which looks to be the case.This is an amazing movie with an interesting storyline. Worth a watch.",7,0,2,29 August 2016
The Lego Movie," Chappy Watched: The Lego Movie
","When this movie was announced, I'm pretty sure the collective wails could be heard all over the world, both from our childhoods being ruined (again - I'm looking at you Michael Bay and Battleship) and for the future of movies.I have to say I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn't a horrible movie!It has a story for the adults to follow, it's hugely bright and colourful, it's funny, and the story also, while predominately funny, has heart and a range of emotions.For the kids it has Lego but it doesn't stop at ordinary Lego men and women, it has plenty of movie characters like Batman, Superman and My Little Pony.There is a huge cast of actors voicing this movie, including Anthony Daniels and Billy Dee Williams voicing the Lego versions of their Star Wars characters, and there is even some live action acting in it.Now I didn't see this in 3D so I couldn't tell you what it was like or if it's worth buying the 3D Blu-ray.The Lego Movie is definitely worth a watch, just something to sit back and switch your brain off for 90 or so minutes, or even something to own for the kids or even yourself.",6,1,3,28 May 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Chappy Watched: X-Men: Days of Future Past
","Welcome to Wolverine 6: Days Of Future Past!At this point I'm starting to get real bored with Hugh Jackman/Wolverine. Wasn't this why Wolverine got his own movies, so he could be the lead in them? The X-Men comics were published just over 50 years ago; there is a rich catalogue of characters, so let's focus on some of them, yeah?Having said that, it was really amazing that they managed to get a lot of the core actors from both X-Men movie series' back together, making this a pretty epic cast!The first two X-Men films are awesome, the third one made me want to cry with how horrible it was, the Wolverine films are okay but First Class and now DOFP have reinstalled my faith in Fox and the X-Men universe.I'm pretty disappointed Rogue's storyline was cut from the film, I'm pretty sure I could have found some scenes to cut that weren't necessary and I think it sucks that they couldn't give the filmmakers some extra time considering these films are pretty much moneymakers for the studios so what are 15 or so minutes more?I think it translated very well from the comics to the cartoon to the movie, obviously things are different in transitioning it to the big screen but it still makes for a good movie. Makes me excited for the next X-Men film.A very good movie, worth a watch if you are a fan of the comics, cartoons or the other X-Men movies. Definitely a day one purchase for me.NOTE: There is a scene after the credits.",7,1,2,28 May 2016
Inside Out," Chappy Watched: Inside Out
","Disney/Pixar is such a sure bet for me. I could not know a lot about one of their movies and will still go and see it.Yeah, they aren't always great (Cars and Cars 2) but they still manage to be entertaining.Before I talk about Inside Out, I just want to give massive kudos to the short film that was shown beforehand. 'Lava' is beautiful, moving, entertaining and just a great story that is told in 7 minutes.Now to talk about Inside Out.The thing I love most about this movie is the voice cast. Amy Poehler (Joy), Phyllis Smith (Sadness), Bill Hader (Fear), Lewis Black (Anger) and Mindy Kaling (Disgust) are all amazing in this and held your attention.The second best thing is the colour. There is so much colour in this, it's visually stunning and full of detail.This movie is entertaining to watch for both children and adults, so much detail in the animation, full of so much emotion and even a few tears (just a few!).There was a point towards the middle where I did start to lose interest but it wasn't long before I got back into the story.Will definitely be buying this and watching it again when it's released to own.",8,4,21,7 May 2016
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Chappy Watched: How To Train Your Dragon 2
","I LOVE the first movie. My favourite animated film, outside of Disney, of all time and I was worried that this might not hold up to the original.I was wrong.I'm still in two minds if it is better than the original though.One thing that astounds me is the detail. The effects are absolutely mind-blowing and very thorough. There are some shots of Toothless where you can see the detail in his scales, including sometimes dirt and scars.The original voice cast is back and still awesome, the story is amazing, the effects are jaw dropping and the score fits with the film perfectly.This movie has everything in just over 100 minutes; action, adventure, laughs, tears for every one of all ages.I just have one complaint I DON'T WANNA WAIT JUST OVER THREE YEARS FOR THE NEXT FILM!!!",9,12,17,7 May 2016
Frozen," Chappy Watched: Frozen
","It's a Disney movie so you can't really go wrong.Awesome animation with lots of detail - even down to the littlest of things, that you would expect to come from a Disney film, with a great voice cast and also a good and enjoyable story. There are some funny bits for both the kids and adults, also some jokes that the teenagers and adults will get.I've read a few things about the similarities between this and Tangled, there are some but not enough that I would be calling this the winter version of Tangled. Definitely worth a watch. Will be buying this on day of release!!!",6,3,8,7 June 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Chappy Watched: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty
","I'm not a fan of Ben Stiller, the only things of his I like are Mystery Men and Night At The Museum and even then they weren't that great.This movie is amazing. Ben Stiller and Kristen Wiig steal the show. The scenery and the movie itself are beautiful. The story is brilliant and even inspiring. I think what made this movie so good is that it's relatable. That you can see yourself in Walter. I've read a couple of comments bagging Kristen Wiig's performance of Space Oddity and as a Bowie fan, I can say that it is actually quite good. A really good movie, worth a watch and maybe even a day one purchase!",6,0,0,28 May 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," Chappy Watched: X-Men: Apocalypse
","I've loved the X-Men since I was a kid with the comics and the awesome animated series but I have a love/hate relationship with these movies. I love being in the universe but I hate the inconsistency and completely skewed timeline of these movies!First and foremost, Apocalypse looked horrendous! Absolutely 100% sh*t! The design on his face was done poorly, his voice didn't fit the character, it looked like he was always sweaty and he looked like he was painted a different colour. At least characters from Marvel Studios like Ronan and Gamora looked like they were actually that colour!Apparently Jubilee is supposed to be in this movie – could have fooled me! At no point is her name ever mentioned, she has only a couple of lines and never uses her powers! So very disappointing!I was quite disappointed in Angel/Archangel, his timeline was ruined by this movie and also Psylocke, who felt like she was just in it to look pretty – never mentioned her name and we got no story at all.Can we please just go one X-Men movie without Wolverine! All these little cameos that don't really serve much purpose.There were good moments in this film, like the new additions to the cast, and bad ones too, namely Apocalypse!It was awesome to see the Danger Room and to see the characters in costumes that seem to have gotten some inspiration from the original comic and cartoon versions.I will watch it again, probably buy it on Blu-ray but I always have to wonder; what would Marvel Studios do if they had X-Men!",6,1,6,29 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Chappy Watched: The Amazing Spider-Man 2
","It is such a difficult task to beat the sheer cinematic brilliance that was the original Spider-Man trilogy but somehow they manage.If I didn't think so in the first movie, this movie confirmed for me that Andrew Garfield is the perfect choice to play Peter Parker. The thing that captured my attention in this movie is that it doesn't feel like he is acting, it's feels like that is his actual personality and traits.The same can be said with Emma Stone. When those two share a scene together, it's like they aren't acting at all.This movie has a lot of foreshadowing to the future Spider-Man movies and the planned spin- offs and even references and small appearances by characters that may or may not live up to their comic destiny in this universe.Something I also liked was the new Green Goblin costume. This version has a sense of realism to it, something you can see an actually villain wearing, not some cartoon character costume like the William Dafoe/James Franco costume looked like.There is a scene between Peter and Aunt May that is just remarkable! Certainly shows you why Andrew Garfield is where he is now and why Sally Field has been nominated and won so many awards in her acting career!If you are a fan of comic books and/or the first Amazing Spider-Man, well you probably would have already seen this, but if you haven't than you should get on that! This will definitely be a Day 1 purchase for me.",6,2,8,28 May 2016
Big Hero 6," Chappy Watched: Big Hero 6
","Can Disney do any wrong with their animated films? They most definitely did not with this one!I'll just give a mention to the short film that played before the movie called 'Feast'. A beautiful story with plenty of heart, none of which is compromised in it's short 6 minutes.Now let's talk Big Hero 6.I actually hadn't heard a lot about this film, had only watched the trailer once but it's a Disney film so I felt pretty safe with going in without knowing a lot about it.This film was released in America on November 7th but Australia wasn't getting it in cinemas until December 26th! I was lucky enough to go to an advanced screening.After all these years, Disney sure does know how to have you laughing one minute and bawling your eyes out the next!The animation, the scenery and the colours are all beautiful. The voice cast fit the characters perfectly and the story is just amazing.There is the right amount of comedy and emotions, lovable characters and a mix of The Avengers and How To Train Your Dragon.Having said all that, Baymax, the personal healthcare robot, steals the whole show!An awesome movie that the whole family can see and watch more than once.I will 100% be purchasing this on day one!",9,1,1,7 May 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," Chappy Watched: Guardians Of The Galaxy
","I knew nothing about Guardians Of The Galaxy before the film was announced and even afterwards I still know nothing about them.So I didn't really have any expectations going into the film and was I surprised.IT WAS AMAZING! Probably my favourite Marvel film!The story was awesome, it was funny without being stupid, wasn't oversexualised and the aliens and space shots weren't overdone but still looked wicked.I was under the assumption that this film was set in like the year 3000 or something so I was quiet surprised to see that this is set in present time, just set outside and away from Earth.Loved the cast! Not too familiar with Chris Pratt but he was definitely a good fit in the film. Dave Bautista was a surprise in his role as Drax (I don't hold too much value in wrestlers as actors, although Dwayne Johnson is probably the better one out of them.)Major kudos to the creative team that they could make you fall in love and feel emotions towards two totally computer generated characters.The soundtrack to this film is equally as awesome as the movie, if not better.If you a Marvel fan, most definitely check this film out!I will most certainly be buying this on day one!!",9,0,5,28 May 2016
Jurassic World," Chappy Watched: Jurassic World
","Why the f*ck are people still going to these parks!Also, it's always the bloody scientists, rich people and just plain idiots that are the reasons these disasters happen!If these scientists are going to play around with genetics, why not make all these dinosaurs herbivores to eliminate the risk?In these types of movies, I'm always on the side of the animals/creatures and could care less about the stupid humans, especially with most of them thinking animals aren't smart and can't learn anything, and it's exactly like this in Jurassic World.Although I didn't expect much with the story, we've seen this before, it was still enjoyable to watch but still was predictable in the other story lines aside form the dinosaurs escaping; for example the side stories of some of the main characters.The movie did have an awesome cast including of course, Chris Pratt, who I'm glad that they didn't try to overuse given his popularity since Guardians of The Galaxy. Massive kudos to Bryce Dallas Howard for all the running she did in those heels.I'm actually quite surprised at the amount of references to the first Jurassic Park; I expected at least one but there were quite a few and not ones that were thrown in your face either.I'll be interested to see the story for, the inevitable, sequel because who is going to go to another park?An enjoyable, entertaining movie that I will see again in the cinemas and will definitely be an addition to my bluray collection.",8,14,23,8 April 2016
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Chappy Watched: The Avengers: Age Of Ultron
","Being a sequel, no time is wasted establishing characters, how they met and establishing teams - it just starts straight away with the story and action.I love how it seems that they have been working together on missions since we left them in the first film, the team is more unified and understand how the others members work.I really enjoy watching this cast on both the big screen and all the press they do together, from everything you see, it seems they are close friends, which translates to the screen.I loved the introduction of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I really hope we see more of them in the future.And yes, I'm well aware Quicksilver died but anything can happen in this universe and I really hope it does because I really enjoyed this Quicksilver over the one in X-Men: Days Of Future Past; the acting, the speed blur, the costume and pretty much everything!I found Ultron, voiced by James Spader, to be absolutely captivating; his voice, his quirks and mannerisms. Definitely captured my focus whenever he was on the screen.I'm glad we got to see more of the characters that don't get their own films (Black Widow, Hawkeye and The Hulk) and weren't the focus of the first Avengers film. I was convinced Hawkeye was going to die even before seeing the film but when they introduced his family, even more so and was thrilled when he wasn't!I also liked that Clint and Natasha have more of brother/sister relationship than a romantic one and that she is a part of his little secret family, which was another thing that I like about this film; not everyone had to know everything there is about him.One thing I love about all the MCU projects is the ability to be funny without losing it seriousness or without being tacky and there are so many funny moments in throughout this film.There are definitely future glimpses into the future MCU projects like Civil War, including which side some of the characters may head towards, and Black Panther.Another thing I love about the MCU is that most of it, is realistic from the costumes to the characters. As stupid as this may sound; if this was going to happen now, it would look like this - there are no stupidly over the top scenes and over the top costumes.I was happy to see the team change at the end. As much as I may like a character, it's always good to refresh a team like this in both movies and TV shows to stop the stories from getting stale and it's not like you're never going to see these characters again.If you love the Marvel Cinematic Universe then you will love this! Will not be the only time I see this in the cinemas, will probably see it at least two more times!",8,2,4,10 May 2016
Super 8," Chappy Watched: Super 8
","WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG TO WATCH THIS!!!I loved this movie. I'm a fan of J.J. Abrams and his work on TV and film and was definitely not disappointed with this.I love that the 'creature' was shrouded in secrecy for most of this film, only seeing little bits and pieces; I loved it in Godzilla, in Cloverfield too.I love the detail of the film, making it look like we are actually with them in 1979. I loved the effects, the cast, the story and pretty much everything about it.I'm absolutely blown away by the kids and their amazing acting, which is far superior to a lot of the adult actors we have these days. There are obviously adults in the film, the dad (Kyle Chandler) was a douchebag, but in the film they are somewhat background characters and even when they were on the screen, they didn't capture my focus.The train crash in the beginning was epic, something you'd expect to see in Transformers but better!An awesome film, worth a watch and even one to buy, as I now have.",7,0,3,7 May 2016
Pitch Perfect 2," Chappy Watched: Pitch Perfect 2
","I'm a fan of the first movie so I was pretty excited to see the sequel but now after seeing it, I think I prefer the original.The same cast is back with some characters getting bigger roles and some getting less. Rebel Wilson, Adam DeVine and Brittany Snow got themselves bigger parts in this movie while Sklyar Astin got a smaller and kind of useless role in the sequel.Anna Kendrick is still the standout for me with both her dry, sarcastic humour and her singing, which is a big part of the reason I saw the first movie in the first place and eventually the sequel.I liked the music better in the first movie but this did still have its catchy songs.There are funny moments throughout the movie, most them from Rebel Wilson and Adam DeVine, and it is an entertaining film to just sit back, laugh and enjoy.I will probably watch this again when it comes out on bluray and will also check out the third film when it comes out.",6,0,0,7 May 2016
Lucy," Chappy Watched: Lucy
","I didn't really know a lot about this movie but I had heard mostly bad things about it.I don't know what those people were talking about; I really liked it!There is an awesome interwoven mix of story and use of real videos in the beginning that doesn't compromise the flow of the movie.Morgan Freeman is in it and really, that should be enough! I can listen to that man read the phonebook and remain entertained.It's futuristic without overdoing it and has an interesting take on the future scientific prospects, prospects that I wouldn't be surprised that they would be working on as we speak.Scarlett Johansson is awesome in it, as is the rest of the cast. It has a good story with some pretty decent special effects and awesome action scenes.I probably will see it a couple more times and maybe even buy it when it's released. Definitely worth a watch.",6,1,2,28 May 2016
Unbroken," Chappy Watched: Unbroken
","I didn't have any interest in seeing this film, especially in the cinemas, but there wasn't a lot out so we threw caution to the wind and bought tickets.The longest two hours of my life.In my opinion, if you are thinking about the time, the movie isn't doing its job. It was probably about an hour in when I started wishing the time away.It felt as if too much time was spent on small, specific parts of his life – for example; at one point Louis Zamperini and some of his crewmates are lost at sea and it felt that the whole chapter was long and some parts unnecessary. I understand that it was a chapter in his life and part of the story of his strength and courage but still some scenes didn't need to be as long or needed altogether.Aside from being long, it's a gloomy film and just goes from one horrible event to another and so on. There are some light hearted moments in the beginning but then the rest of the film is pretty glum so much so that I had to go home and watch something happy.There aren't many well know actors, Garrett Hedlund and Jai Courtney being the only recognizable ones but lead stars, Jack O'Connell and Takamasa Ishihara, do a pretty awesome job of keeping me remotely interested in the story.I loved at the end of the film we got to see pictures of the real life Louis Zamperini after the event of the film and learn what happened to him afterwards, even a clip of him running with the Olympic torch.I'll won't be watching it again, once was more than enough.",4,0,0,7 May 2016
Godzilla," Chappy Watched: Godzilla
","Before this movie was released in cinemas, I watched all of the old Godzilla movies (including the horrible Matthew Broderick one). The first one, Gojira, was definitely the best one and after seeing this new one, Gojira is still my favourite but this new film is my second.I loved the design and look of this Godzilla, makes the film look a lot more serious than the 'lizard' from Broderick version and from the older Japanese versions.This is a lot more believable; it's something that you could see possibly happen (much like Sharknados according to Tara Reid!).There are some amazing shots throughout the film of Godzilla and just general action and scenery shots. I did like that it wasn't until later in the film that you actually got a good decent shot of Godzilla, most of the others were just headshots or were clouded in smoke.When I was in the cinema and saw Godzilla's tail start to light up wow! I'm pretty sure my fanboy sequel was heard worldwide!!I did feel that this movie didn't need the big names or even the character stories in the film. Godzilla is the star, after him all we would really need would be some little bit characters to appear every now and then, like the military.Eagerly looking forward to the second film!An awesome film, definitely one of my best of 2014, seen it 6 times already and it will still be a day one purchase for me!",8,3,6,28 May 2016
Deadpool," Chappy Watched: Deadpool
","Firstly, congratulations to 20th Century Fox for finally making a decent Marvel movie!I know next to nothing about Deadpool, just the basics, but that didn't stop me from being very interested in seeing this. Major, major kudos to the advertising department for the amazing ad work leading up to the movie!This is the role Ryan Reynolds was supposed to play instead of that horrendous disaster that was Green Lantern.It's funny, it's crude, it's VERY bloody and very violent and I loved it! It also has an amazing soundtrack featuring Salt-N-Pepa.There were some CGI scenes that looked very rubbery, quality you'd expect out of something like Sharknado.The cast and characters were very so/so. Reynolds and Karan Soni (Dopinder) were the best with Leslie Uggams (Blind Al), Brianna Hildebrand (Negasonic Teenage Warhead) and Stefan Kapicic (Colossus) rounding out the better cast and characters. The villains (Ed Skrein as Ajax and Gina Carano as Angel Dust) were very mediocre, bordering on boring, and you have to wonder if it's due to the small roster of villains Fox have or they just wanted dull villains so the major focus goes to Deadpool.If I remember correctly, Daniel Cudmore, who played Colossus in the X-Men films was asked to play the character again in the film but he turned it downÂ… Why the hell would you do that? Colossus spoke and was in more of this movie than he was in all three X-Men films!!Another thing I LOVED about this film was the constant jabs at Fox, Marvel, Green Lantern, Reynolds himself, the skewed timeline and many, many more.An entertaining film that I will most definitely be seeing again, buying when it's released and eagerly awaiting the just announced sequel!CHAPPY THINKS watching a guy in a suit turning that other guy into a f*cking kebab has never been more awesome!!",8,4,12,12 February 2016
300," Chappy Watched: 300/300: Rise Of An Empire
","I could barely remember the first movie, so I had to rewatch it before watching the sequel.If you didn't know beforehand, these movies are just action, blood, violence, sex and nudity. If you expect anything more, don't watch these movies.Both these are movies that you can turn your brain off, just sit back and enjoy.I would have to say that I preferred 300: Rise Of An Empire better than the first movie. I was under the impression that it takes place after the first movie but learnt pretty early that it takes place the same time as the first, just centering on a different person/group.It does have a heavy use on the CGI but it is based on a comic book so action scenes and deaths are heavily exaggerated, which they bring to the screen.There is also a heavy use of the spray tan, make up for the fake abs and the oil to make the muscles glisten.Both movies have a pretty good cast but Eva Green steals the show for me; she does crazy really, really well and also has some pretty awesome costumes!Some decent films, if you don't go into them expecting too much and ones you can watch multiple times.",6,1,1,10 May 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Chappy Watched: Kingsman - The Secret Service
","BEST FILM OF 2015!!I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening of this movie through work a month before it's release in Australia.This film was first brought to my attention at WonderCon when a rough first trailer was shown and I was instantly interested.The cast is absolutely brilliant with top-notch performances by newcomer Taron Egerton, Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Strong and Michael Caine.There are heaps of pop culture references throughout the film, the fight scenes are a cross between the 1960's TV show 'The Avengers' and Black Widow's fighting skills, hilariously funny and a lot more violent than I thought it was going to be (no complaints here!).I don't think I have one bad thing to say about this film and I could have easily turned back around and watched it again.I WILL be seeing this again when it's released in cinemas and it will 100% be a day one purchase, when it's released on Blu-ray!",9,4,7,7 May 2016
Minions," Chappy Watched: Minions
","These little guys were the highlights of Despicable Me films, so when I heard they were getting their own movie, I was stoked!I was not disappointed.I had a little bit of hesitancy over the fact that these guys don't speak any language known to man so how are they going to have a whole movie about them when no one can understand what the hell they are saying. Well it's mostly a combination of being narrated by Geoffrey Rush, jokes, and generally having an idea of the topic.It funny with laugh out loud moments and has jokes for adults and children, awesome voice actors (Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton and Allison Janney) and beautiful, smooth animation. Also worth a mention is the awesome soundtrack, much like the previous films.It was awesome to see them from their creation to looking for a master throughout the prehistoric ages, dark ages through to the '60s and all the different masters they had and their eventual demise.Minions is an awesome movie with 91 minutes of lighthearted fun and if you are a fan of the first two Despicable Me films, then you should watch this. I will be definitely be buying it on Blu-ray on Day 1.",8,0,0,27 March 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Chappy Watched: Mad Max - Fury Road
","I had absolutely zero interest in seeing this movie, I hadn't seen any of the previous three and had no interest in seeing this one but then I was told by a workmate that I had to watch it.That, along with the fact that I have not heard one bad thing about it, convinced me to give it a go.I understand all the hype now!It's dark and it's twisted and also apocalyptic. Those devices the breeders (Immortan Joe's Wives) had attached to them and the whole milking scene were just some weird sh*t! The scenery is absolutely beautiful, all that sand, more sand and even you guessed it more sand.The visual effects are amazing throughout the movie, especially the sand storm scene. The stunts are also worth a mention; the whole 'pole cats' scenes in the middle of a massive fight scene as well as The Doof Warrior are awesome.I also loved the design of the rig, designed with things needed for the harsh terrain. There's a scene in the film where it catches on fire before a grate is lowered into the ground to chuck sand over the fire and put it out.It has an awesome cast of big and small actors, American and Australia, but most of my attention always was drawn to Charlize Theron as Furiousa!This film is definitely worth a watch, even if you haven't seen the previous films. It would also be something I would watch again and will probably even own at some point.",8,1,4,6 February 2016
Warm Bodies," Chappy Watched: Warm Bodies
","So I'll start off by saying that this film does have Twilight themes to it but is 1000 times better and manages to tell a better film in one movie as opposed to four.The film starts straight away; there is no dwelling on how it all happened or even how far into the world it reaches.If you are expecting a Walking Dead, Dawn Of The Dead or Resident Evil level of zombie, flesh, blood and violence then you are going to be disappointed. This is a different take on zombies; they still eat flesh but it's a lot more toned down than any of the previously mentioned titles.The film is narrated by 'R', as he spends his days hanging around an abandoned airport, on the outside he is sluggish and struggles to even get one word out but he seems intellectually capable and aware in his mind. I did find it weird that these zombies are more functional than most, having the ability to open door and play records.It's also different to see that when the zombies eat a person's brain, they get their memories, feeling and emotions and there are also two types of zombies; the more human ones that can evolve or the 'bonies' that gave up on life and just become an empty shell.It has a really good cast with most of the focus on Nicholas Hoult, Teresa Palmer and Rob Corddry but with Dave Franco, John Malkovich and Analeigh Tipton rounding out a good group of actors.The soundtrack is also worth a mention with songs by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springstein, Roy Orbison, Guns N' Roses and Bon Iver.An enjoyable movie that should at least be watched once but I wouldn't be against watching it again.",5,3,4,7 May 2016
The Martian," CHAPPY WATCHED: The Martian
","I had no real interest in seeing this movie, I probably would have watched it once it was released to own but there was no immediate hurry.After the constant barrage of positive reviews and the fact that there was nothing else on, I ended up seeing it at the cinemas.THIS MOVIE IS F*CKING FANTASTIC!I left the cinema completely flabbergasted at the movie itself and how much I loved it.I knew of the impressive cast so I knew it didn't just focus on Mars but what I didn't expect was just how much of the film cut between Mars, Earth and in between and how smooth and effortlessly it was done.The story is brilliant and entertaining throughout but also a lot funnier than I thought it would be. The special fx are awesome and they don't try to overdo it with what Mars could be like.Now let's talk about the cast; this may be one of the best group of actors in a film. Each role, no matter how big or small, is perfectly acted by a range of actors. I was especially excited about my first experience at seeing Kristen Wiig in a serious role and I was not disappointed.Even the soundtrack of this movie is awesome with artists like David Bowie, Donna Summer and ABBA.Immediately after seeing this movie, it has made its way into my Top 5 of 2015 and probably also my Top 10 of all time!See this movie – it's brilliant.CHAPPY THINKS that the potatoes may have been made from sh*t but this movie wasn't!",10,6,10,3 February 2016
Furious 7," Chappy Watched: Furious 7
","I'm not a car fan. I know just enough to get me by with owning one but for some reason, I love these movies.I can't tell you what the hell they are driving but there look nice!If you watch these films and expect cinematic brilliance, then you are going to be very disappointed! It's just some mindless fun to sit back, turn your brain off for 90 or so minutes and watch some awesome action with awesome stunts!I've loved this cast from the beginning, which is probably why Tokyo Drift is my least favourite, and with every movie they just seem to get closer and closer, as both characters and actors, which translates onto the screen.You knew things were going to get to a point where they would get sad and that happened when you started to notice that it wasn't Paul Walker you were seeing. There was one scene in particular where his face was constantly obscured - be it by shadows, camera angles or just plain back of the head views.I do wonder how the film would have gone if Paul hadn't died, how much of the story changed.I'm very glad they didn't kill him off at the end, I think it would have been very cheap but the baby storyline was obviously only an inclusion due to his death because you never see anyone directly tell him and when he has a phone call with Mia and she tells him the news, he doesn't say anything about it.I can't even imagine how hard it would have been for the cast 1) to lose him but then 2) to watch his brothers have to come in and play him, especially in the final scene.An awesome movie, just something to sit back and enjoy. Will be watching again and will also be purchasing when it comes out on Blu-ray!",7,0,17,7 May 2016
