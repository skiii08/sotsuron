The Blair Witch Project," Worst ever
",I got dragged to this movie because my girlfriend's teenagers needed to be with an adult to get in. It should never have made it past the film festivals. It's like a group of middle schoolers sneaked their parents video camera out of the house and goofed around with it all weekend. If we didn't have to drive the kids home I would have walked out very early. It starts bad and it gets worse. Anybody who got scared by this must hear a lot of bumps in the night. Amateurish and definitely boring.,Null,0,1,21 February 2000
