It," Average Horror
","I have not read the book so my revue is based solely on the movie. It's not a bad story. I see George Orwell's theme of our own internals fears being used against us as a basis. It is suspense based rather than gore. However, the suspense never really hits a high point. The acting by the kids is quite good which can adversely affect a film when children are used. One thing that I found very frustrating was the poor lighting in the dark scenes. Yes I know that might sound stupid. But in a film you should be able to properly see what is going on.",5,1,4,27 May 2019
The Death of Stalin," OK Satire
","This is a witty, well acted satire based on the events that took place within the Soviet government following the death of Stalin. You may smile through the movie but don't expect to laugh. It has been criticised for being historically inaccurate. Perhaps so, but it is not a documentary it's a parody. It's a clever movie and well worth a watch.",8,0,1,21 October 2018
Inglourious Basterds," All over the place
","The acting in this film is quite good. The storyline is ok but wanders off at times to being ludicrous. It contains violence, which you would expect in a war film, but it some scenes are just gratuitous. The biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. It contains all parts of drama, war, action and black comedy. That maybe the makers intentions, however, the ongoing result is it's frustrating and annoying. It's not a bad movie but in no way deserves high scores or classic status.",4,3,8,19 May 2019
The Others," Hang in there for the end
","There is nothing wrong with a great deal of this movie. However, it does tend to move quite slowly with the story progressing very little, which is very frustrating. It is not till the final 15 minutes of the film does it all start to come together and heighten your interest. If you hang in there till the end it has an interesting finale.",5,2,5,27 January 2019
The Hateful Eight," Gratuitous Violence let's it down
","Quite simply this is a good story that is well acted all round. It should deserve a higher score and a recommendation that it be watched. However, the gratuitous over the top violence is completely unnecessary and is the film's downside.",5,1,6,31 May 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Great Story with a Powerful Finale
","This film is apparently based on fact but to what extent is unknown. However, in any event, the fact that this story has remained relatively unknown till the making of this film makes the movie intriguing and keeps the viewer interested. It is serious subject matter which is alleviated on occasion with lighter moments, but they do not detract or demean from its message. Whilst thinking it was a good film at the end, it was when it showed the real footage from the crime in Virginia in 2017 during the final credits, it made me also realise it was sending a powerful message. It is a movie you must see.",8,4,11,3 May 2019
Gone Baby Gone," End message is disgraceful
","The movie is an interesting story and a good watch. However, it throws it all away in the end. The lead character returns a missing child to her mother. In effect he states that a young child is better off with her mother, even though she is a drug addict and neglects the child and treats her badly, simply because the woman is her mother. Thus condemning the child to a horrid upbringing.",1,3,6,25 October 2018
Baby Driver," Basically a remake
","This movie basically appears to be a remake of the 1978 film 'The Driver' with Ryan O'Neal. However, instead of the drivers problem being a Police Officer, in this it is one of the other crooks. The soundtracks are pretty good but appear to be used to carry what is otherwise an average movie.",6,2,3,30 June 2018
Justice League," Just Another Superhero Movie
","If your a fan of the superhero genre then you'll probably think this ok. But the genre is now overexposed and the industry is struggling for decent storyline's. This film is an example of such. The acting, effects and action are ok. However, the story uninteresting and boring.",5,1,10,22 December 2018
28 Weeks Later," Typical Zombie Genre Movie. Nothing Special.
","This is a movie in the zombie style genre. However, it is more similar in style to the 'Residential Evil' series of movies. That being that people are crazed by a virus rather than being 'undead'. It has a number of very well known actors. Though there is no depth in their characters and their talents appear to be wasted. But they can do little to improve the film, as there are there are no surprises in this and its plot and ending are very predictable. It has obviously been intended to present this film in a different way to its contemporaries. Perhaps the movies only fresh approach to the genre is its obvious dark side. It is filmed in almost black and white and has a grittiness not seen in other movies of the same style.",3,2,3,9 January 2015
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Milking Harry Potter
","It seems like once the Harry Potter series finished some executive has tried to work out a way to continue to milk its success. Thus we have this movie. It's not that bad but it's obvious why it's been made. A bit like the Star Wars franchise, people just don't know how to finish it and leave it alone.",5,0,2,10 November 2018
1941," Slapstick Cornball
","This film had a lot of promise with a great cast, however, it fails miserably. Its humour is slapstick, very obvious,childish and lacking any sophistication. It is cringeworthy to watch.",1,1,2,13 March 2020
Caddyshack," Has not aged well
","I watched this in the 80's and thought it was hilarious. With the exception of Rodney Dangerfield who, with all due respect, is a US favourite but not liked overseas. I recently watched it again and feel that the comedy is obvious and dated. If it were not for the gopher and Bill Murray it would not rate at all",4,4,8,3 March 2019
This Is Spinal Tap," Grossly Overrated
","The story, as a mockumentary of a behind the scenes look at a British Rock band had loads of potential. However, it just falls flat. The entire script being ad lib and improvisation fails across the board at delivering any comedy, and so the film fails badly.",1,4,18,30 September 2019
Invincible," A feel good movie
","Write from the beginning you can see where this film is going. But that's Ok. This is not a film with a deep meaning or to make you think. It just makes you feel good. Both the main stars, Wahlberg and Banks seem well suited to their roles and that also includes the supporting actors. Maybe it's not entirely historically accurate but that's not the point.",8,0,0,20 November 2019
The Disaster Artist," Grossly overrated- Awful
",This is a bad movie about the making of a bad movie. Acting badly to recreate the bad acting in the original movie does not make it good acting. The script appears to be non existent and just ad lib. If the film was intended to be serious or a parody it has badly missed the mark on both counts. Excruciating to watch.,1,11,20,30 September 2018
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," No redeeming features
","This movie fails on many levels. The script is not sharp, clever, subtle or witty. What comedy there maybe in this film is blunt and in your face and more the level of 10 year olds. The main characters acting is appallingly over the top. Whilst that maybe part of the mistaken intended comedy it ends up being annoying and woeful. This film has no redeeming features",1,2,3,30 May 2020
The Good Shepherd," Romance plot ruins it
",This had all the makings of a good suspenseful spy thriller and achieves that when it's focused on that part of the story. Where the film lets itself down is when goes off on a tangent and deals with the personal life of the main character. This has created a boring back story which ultimately ruins the suspense of the main story and the movie overall.,6,2,2,15 November 2018
Black Panther," Unbelievably Overrated
","Two main aspects of this film are below average. Those being acting and storyline. However, what hurts this movie the most is the rave reviews it received across the board. These reviews are clearly unwarranted. Whilst watching the film you are constantly waiting for it to dramatically improve, only to be disappointed.",3,9,13,12 November 2018
Godzilla," Anything but Godzilla
","If you are a fan of Godzilla, this is extremely disappointing. Godzilla's appearance or relevance to this movie is almost non existent. It would seem that he is only fleetingly in the film so they could use the title.",3,0,0,25 February 2019
Incredibles 2," Agendas in a Family Movie is Not Cool
","This movie has a PG rating but it is a family movie. It has its light and witty moments which are entertaining. However, why this movie scores so badly is it is very heavy handed and clumsy with its political message.",3,3,11,5 May 2019
