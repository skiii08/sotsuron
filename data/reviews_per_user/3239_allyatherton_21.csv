The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Mesmerizing.
","Starring Irene JacobDirected by Krzysztof KieslowskiWritten by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof PiesiewiczImagine if each of us is matched somewhere in the world, by our exact double - someone to share our thoughts and dreams.I loved this one. It is quirky, different and beautifully shot. There are no car chases or murderers on the run, just a wonderfully crafted and mesmerizing movie. It's a work of art as much as it is a movie and it had me glued to the screen. This was right up my alley, it's just the kind of oddball, quirky thing that I enjoy.Brilliantly acted by Irene Jacob and she is incredibly beautiful as well. I can't praise this enough. I must watch more foreign movies, especially directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski.Mesmerizing 10/10",10,1,4,31 October 2015
Changeling," A pretty dull affair.
","A mother is reunited with her missing child but she is convinced he is an imposter.Starring Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. Written by J Michael Straczynski.Directed by Clint Eastwood.When I first read the premise of this I was drawn in. It sounded like it would be an interesting movie, especially as it was based on a true story.Sadly though I found whole thing distinctly average.The first thing that struck me was how lacklustre the acting performances were. Angelina Jolie was so robotic it felt like she was doing a terrible impression of Joan Collins all the way through the movie. And as for John Malkovich, I just wanted to poke him with a large stick to make sure he was still breathing.The whole production was dull and pretty lifeless. I wasn't surprised at all to get the to end credits to realize that it was directed and part produced by Clint Eastwood. He was a fantastic actor but maybe that doesn't always mean you will become a brilliant director? I'll have to watch more of his movies to find out.Only a few positive things I can say about Changeling.I really liked the exterior shots of LA in the twenties. I loved seeing all the old cars and trams floating about. So a big credit to whoever designed that. Also the only acting performance with any real life in it was Jason Butler Harner who sadly only appeared towards the end. His performance as Gordon Northcott was the film's saving grace. A bright light in a very dark and gloomy tunnel!6/10",6,0,3,21 November 2015
Skyfall," Best Bond film for a long time.
","I haven't been a great fan of Daniel Craig's Bond so far. He's a great actor and you can't blame him for any of the story lines but for me his first few films have been overcomplicated and unnecessarily pretentious.This is Bond back to basics though. Lots of great action sequences and a decent (not over convoluted) story line for once. The plot is good although it has a few ropey moments but that didn't detract me from my enjoyment. Every bond film has to have a few ropey plot holes, it wouldn't be Bond without them.I particularly liked the idea of Bond going back to his family home at the end of the film. It felt like we were learning a bit more about him and that's a great addition.Overall this is the best Bond film for a long time.",8,2,6,13 February 2015
The Hangover," Curl up on the couch and enjoy.
","Two days before his wedding a guy goes to Las Vegas for one last blow up.Starring Zack Galifianakis, Bradley Cooper, Justin Bartha and Ed Helms.Written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore.Directed by Todd Phillips.There's nothing not to love about this. It is hilarious and the perfect thing to watch whilst curled upon on the couch. Get yourself some popcorn and a drink of your choice and enjoy!It is silly and well acted and it is so good and easy to watch it's almost over as soon as you've pressed play.If you want to have a giggle without having to think too much, this is perfect. I want to watch it all over again!10/10",10,1,2,10 December 2015
Erin Brockovich," Look up the word average in the dictionary and you'll find Erin Brockavich
","A woman's fight against water pollutionStarring Julia Roberts, Albert Finney and Aaron EchhartWritten by Susannah GrantDirected by Steven Soderbergh.When I read the tagline for this one I wasn't overly excited and I wasn't wrong.This is average at best. Everything about it spells the word average. Average story, average acting and an overall average production. I've seen much better courtroom drama's than this and I'm not really a fan of court room dramas.The story just about kept my interest but the whole movie seemed to drag and I was literally struggling to keep my eyes open. My son went to bed.Julia Roberts was better than I thought she would be but there are no Oscar winning performances in this one. Probably the most interesting thing about this film is that it's based on a true story and I will probably google it.6.5/10",6,0,3,9 August 2016
Citizen Kane," Something completely different.
","The rise and fall of a publishing tycoon and the search for a lost word.Starring Orson Welles.Written by Herman J Mankiewicz and Orson Welles.Directed by Orson Welles.I'm guessing this was way ahead of it's time. I've seen a few old movies but none like this.I found it really annoying in the beginning and the constant use of flashbacks and news reels was pretty off-putting. It did get better as the movie progressed and it more or less kept my interest, if only to find out the meaning of Rosebud!It was well acted and the story is okay. It was quite artistic and stylish and definitely something a little bit different.Maybe it doesn't stand the test of time as well as a lot of old classics but I enjoyed it.7/10",7,0,1,11 January 2016
Coraline," Incredible. Best movie I've seen for ages.
","A girl discovers a universe where her parents treat her like a Queen but all is not as it seemsVoiced by Dakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher, Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, John Hodgman and Robert Bailey JrWritten by Neil Gaiman (Novel) Screenplay written by and also directed by Henry SelickAt last a great movie!The whole thing is just incredible from the story to the voice actors to the unbelievably good animation. Right from the beginning credits ( which are superb by the way) this movie sucks you in and it doesn't matter how old you are. Neil Gaiman is gaining a top class reputation as a writer and this has all the hallmarks of his imagination. I haven't read the book or most of his books, so I don't know how it compares to the novel, but this works brilliantly as a movie in it's own right.I am in my forties but I enjoyed this movie just as much as any kid would. In my opinion it manages to create a magical world within a magical world much better than anything I've seen from the hands of Tim Burton or anybody else.It's fun and totally hypnotizing.10/10",10,0,0,9 August 2016
The Fan," An average film carried by a great actor.
","Sometimes baseball can be more important than life itself.Starring Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes.Written by Peter Abrahams ( Book ) and Phoef Sutton ( Screenplay).Directed by Tony Scott.Sometimes a very average movie can be carried by one great acting performance.It's never been truer said than in this one. Everything else about The Fan is distinctly average. The plot has been done to death. Obsessed fan becomes a dangerous fan. Obsessed fan has newspaper clippings pinned to his walls. Obsessed fan resorts to murder.Most of the acting performances are average as well, including Wesley Snipes in what I'm guessing is one of his early acting roles. Or maybe it's more of a case of actors being miscast?I didn't buy the plot. For the first half of the film the main character is just a terrible husband that seems destined to screw up his relationship with his ex and his son. And then suddenly the movie jumps the shark and he turns into an obsessed fan with a pair of binoculars and a taste for murder. The whole production is a bit of a damp squid but Robert De Niro delivers a good performance that manages to stop the film from hurtling over the edge of a cliff.An average 6/10 but mainly because of Robert De Niro.",6,0,1,23 November 2015
About Time," Love Actually meets Groundhog Day. Good movie.
","A man discovers he can travel in time and sets out to find loveStarring Domhnall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams and Bill NighyWritten and directed by Richard CurtisWell I am a sucker for any movie that includes time travel so how could I resist this one?Okay it's more Love Actually than The Time Machine if you add a dash of Groundhog Day, but it's a really good feel good film. It's funny and witty in all the right places and it's really cleverly written. It more than keeps you interested for every scene. Normally I wouldn't really consider myself to be a rom-com kind of guy but this is an exception.Domhnall Gleeson as the lead is a little bit of a wimp and the part could easily have been played by Hugh Grant but that aside he still played a good part as did everybody else.This is one I would recommend.Enjoyed 9/10",9,2,3,22 August 2016
Cloverfield," Edge of your seat stuff.
","A group of friends in New York set out on a rescue mission but the city is under attack.Starring Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas, T.J Miller, Michael Stahl-David, Mike Vogel and Odette Annable. Written by Drew Goddard.Directed by Matt Reeves.This is a movie that I've heard about but never got round to watching.I wouldn't say it was a truly scary movie, I didn't find it too scary, I didn't even get creeped out even though I watched it alone with the lights out.But it is really good. It gripped me from the beginning and it's real edge of your seat stuff. It's more exciting and entertaining than it is scary and it's a great twist on the old monster movies. It's like King Kong or Godzilla but an up to date and darker version. You just get to know the main characters enough to keep the whole thing going without getting bogged down with back story. You don't always know what is going on or which character is which but I guess that was intended because of the chaos that develops in the plot.The whole thing is allegorical of 9/11 just like Godzilla was apparently allegorical of the Hiroshima attacks and even some of the outside shots were based on TV footage from the tragedy. For me this movie worked although it's probably not everybody's cup of tea. The monster was well designed and the cinematography was terrific.A fun movie.9/10",9,0,1,18 December 2015
Taxi Driver," I want to watch this all over again,
","A Vietnam veteran takes a job as a taxi driver and slowly becomes disillusioned with what he sees on the streets of New York.Starring Robert De Niro, Cybill Shepherd and Jodie Foster,Written by Paul Schrader.Directed by Martin Scorsese.This gripped me right from the first scene.A decent script combined with great acting and a wonderful score make this a must watch. The cinematography is excellent and although the plot isn't anything particularly clever or complicated, this movie just sucks you in.It's dark and disturbing in all the right places and Robert De Niro is at his absolute best.A real classic. I want to watch this all over again to see what I missed the first time around.9/10",9,2,4,28 December 2015
Shutter Island," Started off hating it, ended up liking it!
","Two cops visit a hospital for the criminally insane to investigate a disappearance.Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo.Written by Laeta Kalogridis ( Screenplay). Dennis Lehane (Novel).Directed by Martin Scorsese.This is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen.At first I didn't like it at all. I couldn't stand the annoyingly loud background score and the artyfarty dream sequences. And right from the beginning I couldn't take to Mark Ruffalo's character, there was just something weird about him and his accent that I couldn't put my finger on.But as the movie goes on it builds up to an amazing and shocking climax. I didn't see it coming although I had a feeling something wasn't quite right! Looking back, this one is one hell of a cleverly constructed script and I'm guessing we have the original novel to thank for that. What started out as an annoying movie actually turned out to be really good and I want to watch it all over again to (without spoiling anything) see what references I missed.I still think it was a bit too artyfarty at times and that background music was too loud and annoying and there was something about the cinematography that I didn't quite like, but overall I think it actually worked.9/10",9,2,4,21 December 2015
The Aviator," Great production but ultimately a bit too long.
","The Story of Aviator Howard Hughes.Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale.Written by John Logan.Directed by Martin Scorsese.I can see why this movie has won so many Oscars. It has all the right ingredients. Great acting, great cinematography, great photography and it is undeniably and unreservedly a Martin Scorsese movie with all of his trademark style and artistry. It's one hell of a production which I'm sure had the Oscar Nominations Board purring and salivating non-stop round the clock.It is fascinating and it is an interesting watch but for me it's too long and a little bit boring. Just because a movie wins lots of Oscars doesn't necessarily mean it's an exciting movie and this fits into that category. It reminded me of Citizen Kane and I'd go as far as saying that it's basically the same kind of thing produced for a more modern audience. And that movie was pretty boring too.This is a film I can appreciate on many levels but it's lacking a decent hook and a good dollop of excitement.7.5/10 for the acting and production values.",7,0,1,17 July 2016
Unknown," I love this movie!
","A man wakes from a coma and loses his identityStarring Liam Neeson and Diane KrugerWritten by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell ( Screenplay) Based on the novel by Didier Van CauwelaertDirected by Jaume Collet-Serra A man loses his memory and nobody recognizes him, including his wife.Does this sound familiar? Well the plot isn't new and the premise has been used in many movies. But guess what? I don't care.I love this film! It has everything that I want in a movie. Great acting, a super plot, some brilliant action scenes and lots of twists. Unlike some movies where the plot twists are difficult to keep up with, I didn't have any difficulty here. The plot is clever but it doesn't try to be too clever. I was with it all the way.It keeps you guessing all the way and I really think that is the secret to a great movie. A good plot keeps you waiting, to find out what happens next. This film suits Liam Neeson. I can't imagine anybody else playing the main lead. And he is a great actor. Not wooden at all like some people suggest.Did I tell you that love this movie?10/10 for me.",10,0,1,29 July 2016
Donnie Brasco," Goodfellas with a plot.
","An FBI undercover agent infiltrates the mob.Starring Johnny Depp and Al Pacino.Written by Joseph D Pistone (Book), Richard Woodley (Book) and Paul Attanasio (Screenplay).Directed by Mike Newell.This is the second mob movie I've seen in a row and it's basically Goodfellas with a plot.It perhaps lacks the overall polish and cinematography of Goodfellas but it makes up for it by having more plot and emotion. I didn't get to know each of the characters as much but that's probably because this is a shorter movie and based more on the relationship between the two leads as opposed to the the mob in general.Al Pacino and Johnny Depp give good lead performances and their dynamic works well. It's my third Al Pacino film and probably my favourite. Likewise I've seen a few Johnny Depp films and this is the best performance I've seen. It's another side to him and it proves what a versatile actor he is as well as having the looks. And that's something you don't always see.I still don't think Mob movies are really my thing but I'm enjoying catching a few and I have another one lined up. If anything I've learned a few things I didn't know before if the mob ever comes up in a pub quiz!Just like Goodfellas this gets an 8 out of 10 but for different reasons. On a side note I was surprised to see who the director of this was considering the previous things he has directed. That's a weird one but he has done a good job.",8,1,2,23 February 2016
The Evil Dead," My teenage self would have loved it. I didn't.
","A group of friends spend the night in a cabin in the mountains and it doesn't go well.Starring Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Richard DeManincor, Betsy Baker and Theresa Tilly.Written and directed by Sam Raimi.I think my age has a lot to answer for.I'm guessing that if I'd watched this as a teenager I would have loved it or at least enjoyed it more than I did now as an old bloke. It definitely had lots of creepy moments and funny moments.But from an old gits perspective I was actually a little bored watching this. I suppose when it was first released this movie would have been cutting edge and the ultimate horror flick. But I got that bored feeling in my stomach that I get when I'm reading a really boring book that I can't wait to finish so I can start the next one. It was all so repetitive. One demon possessed person attacks and then another and then another and then another. there was nothing new here and it's all been done before.The acting was okay but a bit hammy and the special effects ( although probably brilliant in 1981) showed their age.I'm giving it a 6/10 but my teenage self would have given it much more.",6,23,28,15 February 2016
Vanilla Sky," A movie that tries to be too clever for it's own good but fails.
","A wealthy playboy businessman is disfigured in a car accident. But all is not what it seems. Starring Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz,Written by Alejandro Amenabar, Mateo Gil and Cameron Crowe (Screenplay).Directed by Cameron Crowe.Weirdly this is one of those films I've always heard of but I always thought it was some kind of action movie involving fighter pilots. In reality it is totally not what I expected it to be.It's a very bizarre movie that starts off quite normally but then turns into a sci-fi flick. It's full of strange twists and turns and flips itself on it's head quite a lot. For me it's too bizarre and confusing for my liking. I never really got a grasp of what what going on and then the ending was pretty disappointing. It felt like a movie that was trying to be too clever for it's own good and in the end it kind of failed. Don't get me wrong I usually love twisty sci-fi movies but this wasn't my cup of tea.Tom Cruise was Tom Cruise. For me he's a good looking guy but I'm not convinced about his acting and so his performance was average. In fact there weren't really any fantastic stand out performances in this one. Penelope Cruz was hot. But Cameron Diaz was probably the pick of the bunch if I had to choose one.Overall a pretty disappointing movie that didn't rock my world.6/10",6,1,2,13 February 2016
The Deer Hunter," Superb. I finally get the Revels advert!
","One marriage, one party, one war loomingStarring Robert De Niro, John Savage and Christopher WalkenWritten by Michael Cimino, Deric Washburn, Louis Garfinkle and Quinn K RedekerDirected by Michael CiminoThis is a great film.It's pretty long at around three hours so you need to have a bit of spare time and patience, unless, like me, you watch it over a few separate sittings. And it's slow to get going so you will have to stick with it. But it's worth it.Everything about this movie is brilliant. From the acting to the story development to the cinematography. It's a clever movie with lots of hidden meanings and depth and you probably need to watch it a few times to appreciate everything it has to offer.The acting is top notch, especially Christopher Walken.Superb.On a side note I recognized the theme music from a kids TV show in the eighties ( Take Hart) and I finally get the Revels Advert from TV!10/10",10,0,2,12 August 2016
Looper," A great movie ruined by trying to be too many things.
","In a future society, time-travel exists, but it's only available to those with the means to pay for it on the black market. When the mob wants to eliminate someone, it sends the target into the past, where a hit man known as a looper lies in wait to finish the job.Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Brunt.Written and Directed by Rian Johnson.This is a great movie that is ruined by trying to be too many things.I love the premise. A bunch of gangsters in the future get their hands on time travel technology and send their victims 30 years into the past to be killed by people called loopers. It's timeywhimey, it messes with your head. It's original and keeps you guessing and the plot is unraveled as you watch.But then it all goes wrong.Bruce Willis is introduced and soon the movie turns into Die Hard and then later on unbelievably it turns into Stephen King's Carrie! There was no need for this, The plot was doing fine as it was. I can only guess that Rian Johnson was worried that the plot wasn't good enough to stand on its own two feet and panicked.Don't get me wrong there are some decent acting performances by all three of the mains, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It's just a pity that the plot tried to do too many things. It all became too unrealistic and this movie literally lost the plot.7/10",7,0,0,15 November 2015
The Breakfast Club," Probably the best high school movie of the eighties
","A bunch of high school kids spend their Saturday in detentionStarring Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall and Ally SheedyWritten and directed by John HughesThis is another one that I somehow managed to miss during the eighties. But then again I was only thirteen so it was probably a little old for me.I was expecting this to be just like St Elmo's Fire and, although I really liked that movie, this was surprisingly totally different. It really is a great movie. It's very much a typical eighties film but this one has that something extra. It's funny in all the right places but also grabs at your heart strings with a splash of drama in all the right places as well. It's surprisingly well acted and probably has to go down as one of the greatest teenage high school movies ever made.A lot of the plaudits must go down to the terrific script and direction by John Hughes.I wasn't expecting to like this film as much as I did. But it turns out I love it.10/10",10,0,0,21 August 2016
Goodfellas," Plot shy but still a decent movie.
","'As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster.' -- Henry Hill, Brooklyn, N.Y. 1955.Starring Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro.Written by Nicholas Pileggi ( Novel) and Martin Scorsese.Directed by Martin Scorsese.First of all I'll say that this isn't normally the kind of movie I watch. In fact I think ( apart from Bugsy Malone which probably really doesn't count) this is the first Mobster movie I can remember watching, It's a proper guys movie. I'm a guy but I'm not that much of a geezer. This is probably to movies what Top Gear is to TV.It's quite long but it did keep my interest all the way. The acting performances are decent without there really being any stand out performances. Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci ( is he really not related in any way to Joe Paquale?) were probably the pick of the bunch amongst this star studded cast of big nosed very Italian looking actors.Robert De Niro didn't really play a big part and for most of the movie it felt like he was just going through the motions and doing a pretty decent impression of himself, if that makes sense.The cinematography was good and there there lots of laughs, shocks, blood and twists along the way which I'd expect from a Scorsese film. The big problem from my point of view is that there isn't much of a plot. It's very artsy but there isn't much of a plot to keep me that interested. And I prefer a plot to grab hold of. That's probably because its a true story and they didn't want to make up too much stuff in case they offended the wrong people. I mean would you want to p*** off the mob?Overall this is a decent movie if you like this kind of thing. It's not really my kind of thing but it's still worthy of an 8 out of 10.",8,1,1,22 February 2016
