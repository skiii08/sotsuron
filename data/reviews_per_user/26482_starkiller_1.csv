Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Phantom Menace Recommendation
","I thought that The Phantom Menace was the best movie I have ever seen and recommend it to any Star Wars fan.  The acting was a lot better than the previous movies, even though I enjoyed them too, as was the choice of more well known actors/actress'.  Jake Lloyd was excellent in portraying the character of Anakin and seemed a lot older than he is.  Natalie Portman played the queen very well also, being able to switch from being a royal queen to a simple handmaiden very easily.  Liam Neeson played Qui-Gon Jinn so well while watching the Haunting recently could imagine him saying to Luke 'Luke drop' or pulling out his lightsaber.  Jar Jar Binks while thought by others as annoying was pretty funny especially when he got his tongue stuck in the energy binders.Overall I thought the Phantom Menace was a great movie, sticking to the original soundtrack while creating new music, a lot better acting and great special effects (especially the lightsaber fight at the end!!).",Null,0,0,8 January 2000
