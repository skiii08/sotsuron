Iron Man 3," Another Juvenile Action Flick From Marvel
","Starting with the Avengers, Marvel has distastefully aimed their movies at the minds of children under the age of 12. This movie is absolutely, not an exception. Filled with a poorly constructed plot and jokes which took too much effort to make work, the clear focus of this film is the clich√© of childish action flick: some good action and lots of explosions. Overall, quite disappointing as the first two iron man movies were quite enjoyable in my book. I don't know if Disney's involvement or Shane Black's directing is to blame and I don't care. I will say this, if marvel ever decides to make another movie with Iron Man in it, I beg of you, look towards pre-avengers movies for guidelines on how to make a movie that appeals to a mature person.Also, I cannot stress enough the annoyance I find in the absurd length of the film and the constant desperation of the screenwriters to slip in another joke. Contrary to Marvels opinion, a movie can be good AND be under 3 hours long. Also, the constant barrage of ill-though out jokes make for poor entertainment.",4,4,8,4 May 2013
