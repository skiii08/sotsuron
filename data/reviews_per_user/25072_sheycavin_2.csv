The Ring," Disturbing
","I'm not going to get into the whole thing about it being a remake and all of that.  If you're a smart person working a job and looking for a good scare, see this movie.  I grew up watching Freddy and Jason and every episode of 'Faces of Death' hundreds of times.  I've seen all of the classic horror films from 'Night of the Living Dead' to 'Exorcist.'  I even watched the original 'Ringu' as well as 'Ring', the Korean remake of 'Ringu.'  But this movie scared and disturbed me more than anything I've ever seen or read.
Maybe it was the theater environment or maybe even the mood I was in, but this movie freaked me out.  Driving home wasn't easy and I'll have to see how I do going to sleep tonight.  And like I say, I grew up on gore and violence so it's not like I'm sensitive or anything.  Get some friends, head to this movie and watch grown men scream along side thirteen year-old girls. It's a lot of fun.  9/10.PS: Notice how many people are more disturbed by what happens in the ferry scene with the horse than the fact that four teenagers died.  You can waste all of the humans you want, but don't mess with the animals.  I love Americans.",9,0,0,26 October 2002
Grindhouse," Rodriguez 1, Tarantino 0
","The popular opinion seems to be that Tarantino trumps Rodriguez in this one. I've read a lot about how Tarantino has entered that pop icon phase where he could release a film of a 4 year old's birthday party shot on super 8 and it'd be accepted as genius. On one hand I think that's unfair to artists who find themselves in that situation. On the other, Tarantino's effort here may in fact add some fuel to that fire.If 'Death Proof' is reminiscent of anything it's 'Sex and the City' with clips from a great action movie mixed in. The 20 - 30 minute discussions by the ladies (both sets) is mind numbing and, frankly, annoying. A good editor, like Rodriguez, could cut this into a fantastic film.If there's one knock I have on Tarantino it's that all women, especially black women, are the same character in his movies. They are sexy, tough, hardboiled, fast talking tom boys who could whip a man's ass any day that ends in 'y'. And four of them sitting around a table all talking at once is a bit more clich√© and sch-tick than I can stomach.I also found myself cringing several times at how repetitive Tarantino has become. 'Death Proof' contains so many samples from his earlier works that I began to wonder if he had any original ideas left at all. It's one thing to make subtle references to events and places in the worlds you've created as a director (Big Kahuna Burger for example), but it's another to rehash scenes, themes, and entire characters over and over and over.Rodriguez on the other hand shines here with an incredibly fun and entertaining zombie movie that holds its own against any horror film ever made. While being a tribute to all zombie movies that have come before, it's also very original in its story, characters and elements (see: Rose McGowan's machine gun leg). And you have to love how the end reveals the whole thing to be a result of the Iraq War and, ultimately, George Bush's fault. Very clever.Maybe Rodriguez is just better at this genre or maybe Tarantino is really out of new ideas or didn't feel like thinking of any. Regardless, 'Planet Terror' gets a solid 7/10 while 'Death Proof' squeaks out a 4/10.",5,3,5,28 May 2007
