Come and See," Ruthless
","A Soviet drama war film directed by Elem Klimov, Come and See is considered as one of the best war films ever made. Its ruthless depiction of the human actions in WW2 makes it one of the strongest anti-war anti-fascist (as Klimov said he wanted it to be) films in cinema history. In many scenes you get the feeling that Klimov is trying to say that sometimes you're better off dead.. the horrors of war are unbearable.The film opens with an ambiguous scene of a Belarusian young boy digging for something.. we know after a while that he is searching for a rifle to join the resistance against the Nazis. He then starts to witness the horrors and tragedies of war starting from the smallest incidents (such as having to switch his new shoes to old ruined ones) all the way to the massacres committed by the Nazi soldiers in Belarus.The film's accuracy in depicting what really happened in that era (illuminating the Belarusian tragedy rarely shown) is one of its most important features.. and adding to its realism the surrealistic approach used by Klimov only makes it a piece of art. The two approaches are blended in a way that evokes intensity and emotions and masterfully displays the absurdity of human actions during war. The score also is used amazingly in a way to suit the tragic story. The animals' noises, dull hums, war sounds, classical music are all mixed together drawing more and more intensity. In an early scene the protagonist goes deaf leaving us to hear what he hears from noises (strengthening the disturbing atmosphere, especially that in this period he discovers what happened to his family - where he starts acting in a sort of denial). The main subject of the film is the cottage scene in the village 'Perekhody' where the Nazi soldiers put all the villagers in the cottage and burn it. Then they start shooting it while it is burning (showing excessive brutality or maybe absurdity). Before burning it they allow some to flee the cottage but without the children (in the execution scene a Nazi soldier explains the reason - he did not want this inferior race to continue!) and so the child of a young mother that tried to run away with him was taken from her and thrown again into the cottage and she was later raped (her screams were heard but nothing was shown). The protagonist was also allowed to flee and seemed to age throughout the film (pointing out how war kills innocence and how horrifying it is). The main character was a success in this film where the viewer can easily get emotionally attached to the terrified wandering kid.The symbolic and memorable scenes in the film are many. A beautiful German soldier is seen lustily sucking food (linking lust to anger and war? or mocking the 'superior Aryan race'?) and after few scenes she is shown dead with one of her breasts visible. Another scene is the protagonist stepping on a bird's nest killing her babies still in eggs (implying that war gives birth to suffering - or that it kills innocence).. also the death of the cow (some say that Klimov was trying to show that death is sometimes incomprehensible).. the cruel Nazi commander with his unpleasant pet.. the raped young mother with her legs covered with blood and playing on a harmonica a dull and annoying music.. and above all the old peasant that was thrown out while still laying on her bed (the close ups on her face were so emotional and also symbolic). In fact all the close ups from the beginning to the end help the viewer to feel the tragedy and connect with the terrified characters.The German soldiers responsible for the burning of the cottage are then executed.. some tried to burn them to avenge the villagers but few peasants shot them quickly. The scene leaves a lot to interpret but you can feel that even though justice was obtained, nothing could really take back what happened.The best is left to the end where the protagonist for the 'first time' uses his rifle only to shoot Hitler's picture thrown in mud.. and each shot inter-cut with an archival footage of Hitler that is moving backwards. At last when the archival footage comes to a scene where he (Hitler) is a baby in his mother's arms the protagonist could no longer shoot the rifle! The film then plays a classical music with the resistance going into the woods (implying that there is still hope) and the film ends with a shot of the sky. Some assume that the director is questioning God but since the title carries a name from the book of revelation this interpretation does not seem right.. the scene is more likely to be spiritual.A masterpiece from a director that never made any film after it claiming that he did everything he could in that film (and without using even professional actors!)",10,5,6,3 December 2016
The Monuments Men," A Total Disaster.
","Based on real events, this film was a disaster! I'm writing this review while the film is still rolling... well it took me 4 days (everyday watching a bit of it) to get to the last half an hour of this film and I cannot bear watching one more second. If I was watching it in a movie theater I'd surely walk away.In the true story, a force of around 300 men chased a huge number of European art treasures to save them from the Nazis and rescue the heritage of the Western civilization. I guess that the number of men was enormously reduced in this film so that the viewer could relate and connect to the characters.. well probably I couldn't care less even if a bomb demolished them all. Some of the real events were altered to serve the dramatic portrayal and every time the film tried to look serious the scenes only seemed hilarious.The WAR COMEDY film was not funny and the war action scenes were so badly executed that they seemed like rehearsals.. For a moment there I thought that the main characters did not care about what they were doing.. as if some of them were forced to do it.. and this goes even for Cate Blanchett! I don't know how the movie managed to make her look so bad.I did not really expect something so serious, but at least a light movie that makes you laugh.. something like 'The Men Who Stare at Goats'. Yet, this movie failed at every level. I only gave it 3/10 because it is based on a true story that was historically quite important. Or else I consider it only slightly better than 'Battle of Los Angeles (2011)'.",3,10,11,11 January 2017
The Irishman," The Golden Age.. Lost again
","I know it is better to get into a movie with low expectations.. but whatever you expect from Scorsese and De Niro this movie wont match it.Many have said it but I should start with: The movie was too long with the wrong pace and missing any tune. For the first hour and a half it was like watching a huge amount of pictures one coming after the other.. I really don't know what went wrong with the directing and editing.. and all that time it felt like the narrator was just introducing the personalities involved.... it felt like nothing really is happening.From what I heard I expected to see outstanding acting.. Pesci was fine but his role was small.. the same for Romano. Al Pacino was average, overacting at some points... and for De Niro he was simply unable to perform especially in the scenes where he was supposed to be young (one example mentioned by many is the fight at the grocery store). The few good ones were when he was playing the old Frank.For such a movie there was no personality study.. the actors did not age well.. the CGI de-aging technology was annoying.. that dark funny side in Scorsese's movies was missing and a lot more to say if we continue...Many movies fail to entertain but it is only an issue when you have De Niro, Pacino, Pesci, Keitel and others coming one last time together with Scorsese to remind us of the golden age.. and disappoint.",6,5,8,1 December 2019
500 Days of Summer," Fate
","There are a lot of reviews here that summarize this romantic comedy- drama film that talks about a 'boy that meets a girl'. Many described the nonlinear style of narration in this movie where the plot goes back and forth without following the chronological order of the events.. the chemistry within the movie.. the reality in which it deals with romantic relationships.. heartbreaks and tender moments.. the life stages Tom goes through from 'summer to autumn' and the messages the movie is trying to deliver..Yet there is an important idea that I didn't observe in the reviews I read and that's what made me write this review.. I think this idea is one of the most significant ideas the movie is trying to communicate with us.. 'Fate'. Yes the movie is trying to say that not every person you meet is 'the one and only' not even if you share a lot with him/her.. not even if you fall in love! Yes the movie is trying to say that life will always provide you with opportunities for you to be happy.. that you shouldn't fall back because of a bad experience and that you shouldn't lose faith.. that you should work hard and never give up your dreams.. but the movie is also trying to say, especially in the last couple of scenes, that life is meaningful and the world we live in is not just a number of coincidences. Things happen for a reason and whether it is in a sense 'good or bad' we can always make the best of it and benefit from the experience.. and there truly you will be content with the fate life has favored you.",8,0,0,9 November 2016
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," 'Mein Fuhrer! I can walk'!
","Considered to be one of the best dark comedies and political satires ever, Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove is one of the most amusing and brilliant films I have ever seen. The plot is rather simple.. an ill-minded and psychotic United States Air Force general launches a first strike 'preemptive' nuclear attack against the Soviet Union exceeding his authority. The United States president then tries to stop the attack from the war room, communicating with the Soviets and their president to try everything possible to prevent a nuclear war that would destroy the world.One could say a lot about what makes this cold war classic among the best. The directing was ingenious with its various camera styles (Documentary, close ups, long shots - different styles for different locations)... cutting back and forth and keeping it consistent with the story... the varying pace (going faster and faster as the film gets nearer to its crazy, hilarious, and symbolic ending).The screenplay clever, innovative, and witty.. The acting superb.. Sellers, Scott, and Hayden had remarkable performances (especially for Sellers with his three distinct roles).. memorable phrases and jokes: 'Gentlemen you can't fight in here! This is the war room'. The score lovely and fit.Yet, the best thing about this movie is in its ideas, allegories, and metaphors. The film came in the mid 60s and that in itself is astonishing with what it held of its time's fears and the theories that all turned out to be true (as many critics and newspapers remarked).The film's major theory was connecting war with sexual desire. This was shown through various images (mating airplanes, spewing coke machines, 'impotent' bombs, playboy magazine..), spelled out through words and phrases ('loss of essence', 'Bodily fluids'..), hidden behind symbolic names (Jack Ripper: a killer especially of prostitutes, Merkin Muffley: female pubic area, Desadeski: perverted sexual love in the 18th century, and the same in Strangelove, Mandrake, Kissof..), and even presented in the only female character (Miss Scott) with her bathing suit or presence on the cover of a playboy magazine.Another important theme is how technology dominated human life. The film shows numerously how things are getting completely out of control and away from moralities. Also Capitalism gets its share of criticism through the memorable scene of Mandrake in the phone booth.. 'Shoot with a gun.. that's private property'. Moreover, the statement that has been used by many throughout history to justify massacres; 'Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed, but I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops, uh, depending on the breaks', was brilliantly implemented in the plot.By focusing on the relation between war and sex, the film in return shows how the human conduct is leading to a lack of love. The only woman (that is a symbol of love and affection) is presented by one character and by sexual means.. also the theory of Dr. Strangelove at the end adds to it. This leads us to talk about arguably one of the weirdest characters in the history of cinema. His Nazi approach only points out that Nazism may occur in any of our acts, whether on the governmental, corporal, personal or any other level (and it is significantly present in the act of war); 'Mein Fuhrer! I can walk'.The anti-war (which is its overall theme) film succeeded in depicting the different aspects of the cold war from its politics to the paranoiac atmosphere that controlled the minds of nearly everyone. Throughout this feature Dr. Strangelove also succeeded in bringing philosophical theories that concern the human life. A masterpiece.",10,2,3,10 December 2016
La La Land," Amusing but not great..
","A lot of reviews on IMDb thought that this movie deserved a 1/10, and more considered it a great one. And while it seems that this movie is having an undeserved rating, I wouldn't consider it really a bad one. In fact, I had fun watching it and though it is a bit long for its content, it is nevertheless amusing.Yes, movies are subjective.. but still one can judge a movie for what it has got to offer.. especially for movie lovers a set of artistic principles can be laid.I'll be quick on its positive aspects: The music (not the dancing and singing) is good. The plot is entertaining.. some of the scenes (especially between Stones and Gosling) are innovative, and others attempted to revive the classics. Chazelle also put a great deal of effort with the camera-work.Well for the negative side, the singing and dancing were not so good.. and for a musical this is really important. Some said that it was better that the singing was modest, for it appeals more to the characters. But really, a musical should introduce something beautiful for the viewer to get emotionally attached and it won't seem abnormal.. it is a musical after all. Look at West Side Story (1961) or Singin' in the Rain (1952); every song is memorable.. well and that is another issue with La La Land. I forgot the songs the minute the movie ended.The characters also seemed a bit shallow. Gosling's character was a bit deeper than Stone's, but his acting was bad. Emma made a good effort in acting to enhance her character.The script also seemed of little depth. So it is about following your dreams (an idea now overused) and the conflicts one may encounter with the person he/she loves.. and while there is nothing indeed special about this, I have to say that the execution makes it somehow dull. The dialogue is bluntly thrown at us with nothing to take hold of. At some point in the movie I remembered 'In the Mood for Love (2000); a drama/romance movie that I found much deeper and better executed.I won't say anything about the movie's last 15 or 20 minutes that would spoil the movie for you.. but I'd like to point out that it is really inconsistent with the rest of the movie. I think many had the same feeling.. and the way the movie neglected some of the details was not helpful at all.All in all, 'La La Land' is a descent movie and a fun to watch.",7,2,4,23 January 2017
Departures," The harmony between life and death
","..The Godfather, 8 1/2, Solaris, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, Paths of Glory.. etc. When it comes to the old cinema, it is easy for me to find a film that I consider a masterpiece.. that's not the case among 'new films'.However, this is not the case with 'Okuribito (2008)'.. a truly flawless movie that is simply perfect. Based on 'Coffinman', a memoir by Shinmon Aokia, the film follows the life of an untalented musician who goes back to his hometown only to find himself doing one of the oddest jobs for a living.. preparing the dead for funerals (Nokanshi).The film drags you into it from the first beginning.. the highly executed film will draw your senses and pull your feelings to where the protagonist 'Daigo' is.. you will feel his desperation, his confusion, his attempt to find himself, his place in a life that had not granted him enough talent to dig a safe place for himself as a cellist. He is lost and so he goes back to his hometown so maybe he'd find the rebirth.. he is searching for a new beginning.. for an answer.Daigo is now preparing the dead for cremation.. his wife doesn't know and he is not sure about it.. he hesitates.. he struggles with his 'repulsive' new job but keeps on doing it. After a while things really starts to change. He doesn't care about all the criticism, the social taboos, or the prejudices.. through one of the most controversial issues he now finds harmony.. through the horrid appearances he finds peace.. through pain he finds love, and through death he finds life. Now he too thinks that death is a gateway.His wife left him when she knew what his job was.. she went back to him when she knew that she was pregnant thinking that she would find him wrecked without her.. the man who is now in harmony with life, who started to rediscover his own music and the love inside him is far from being wrecked.. he could love her, love everything, and simply live against the conditions.. even the ideas and feelings he carried for his father that left him when he was a child were about to change.Every scene every shot in this masterpiece held certain significance.. The writing, editing, cinematography, acting.. every aspect of it was great. I should say I was fascinated by the character of Daigo's boss Ikuei (depicted by Tsutomu Yamazaki). The old man who has been in touch with the dead for a long time is now so wise about life in everything he does and says. Some reviews criticized the film for overt sentimentality and predictability, while simply this film is not about twists or unpredictable events.. it's a journey to the inside.. a search a quest for peace and love and therefore also its sentimentality was more than proper.. it rips your soul from your body only to find yourself questioning yourself and the life you've been leading. In its drama, romance, or humor this film was just fascinating.",10,0,1,29 October 2016
The Producers," Springtime for Hitler
","Once the King of Broadway, Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) is now a greedy, lustful, and corruptible producer that sexually manipulates old women to get some money. Upon meeting Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), the hysterical and insecure accountant, the two come up with the perfect scheme to gain a fortune. This time they have to fail (something they are both good at) by producing a flop rather than a hit.The producer (1967) was the first film to be directed by Mel Brooks. His debut film is an amusing satire with a mood that makes the viewer lightheartedly go along the wickedness and fraud shown by the main characters. The jokes are rather genuine and the performances help a lot. Many say that the characters scream a lot (especially Wilder), but I only found that to be part of what made his hysterical personality so funny. The gay characters of Roger De Bris (Hewett) and Carmen Ghia (Voutsinas) and the Nazi Franz Liebkind (Mars) added a lot to the hilarious plot. Also, I should say that some of the names and jokes used reflect a witty and culturally knowledgeable Brooks.. (Using the name Prince Myshkin from Dostoyevsky's novel 'The Idiot', or Carmen Ghia = Karmann Ghia.. etc.)The film was criticized also for depicting the two main characters Bialystock and Bloom as two Jews that are trying to cheat theatrical investors; an aspect that many found unoffensive and remarkably clever especially when added to the 'Nazi play scheme' planned for by the protagonists.Although the film was more shocking back then in the 60s (it is claimed that Peter Sellers had to intervene with the executive producer Joseph E. Levine to convince the studio to release it! And it was released on one condition that is changing the title from Springtime for Hitler to The Producers), it is in fact gaining more and more respect throughout the days. Many critics such as Roger Ebert, consider it one of the funniest movies ever. Whatever the taste of the viewer is, I recommend this movie for it is really a brilliant classic film.. the type missed nowadays.",8,1,2,9 January 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Faith in Battlefield
","Gibson's work is a biographical war film about Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector, who 'fought without a rifle' during the battle of Okinawa in WW2. Desmond Doss enlisted in the U.S. army voluntarily as a combat medic refusing then to carry a rifle or even touch it only to save 75 injured soldiers and clear them from the battlefield on his own. Doss won the highest medals in his country to become the first and only conscientious objector to receive the medal of honor in WW2.Desmond, who died in 2006, turned down many offers for books and films because he was scared that they'd portray his life inaccurately. Gibson's film on the contrary, depicts Doss's life rather accurately except for certain events such as him taking the gun out of his father's hands, the details of his first marriage, and bringing him his bible out of the battlefield directly after he was wounded. A veteran of WW2 also stated that the term 'Hacksaw Ridge' was not used back then but rather 'the escarpment'. Otherwise, the life story of Desmond down to the slightest details was depicted accurately. The same veteran even mentioned that they teased Doss a lot asking him all the time, 'What are you gonna do, Doss, if a Japanese comes around the corner and he's got a gun?'.The film starts with scenes from Desmond's childhood were he used to be violent.. then it moves to his romantic life with a bit of comic atmosphere around it.. then the dramatic struggle of Desmond with his comrades and commanders for what he believes in. This is for the first part of the movie.. the action starts with the second part when Desmond goes to Okinawa.. and while the movie starts to become more and more violent the spiritual atmosphere all around it gets stronger (implying that Desmond's faith became stronger after witnessing the battle unlike what happens in many other cases). It is important to note that Desmond in fact was religious and one of his comrades said that he maintained his strong faith even during the battle. Gibson showed in one scene a courageous soldier afraid of death after he was fatally wounded implying also that faith at such moments is vital. The humanity of Doss towards his comrades as well as his enemy was touching (the film showed him rescuing 2 or 3 Japanese soldiers).The symbols were nicely included yet I would say that it was not sentimental enough for its spiritual mood.. maybe it is about the characters' depth (I was not able to get emotionally involved as I did in 'Braveheart') or the sequence of events where I found a gap between the two parts of the film.. Or maybe the incidents shot were more of an action for the second part and comic in the first part and that didn't help in maintaining a general mood of sentimentality. The war scenes nevertheless are thrilling and turn sometimes to more of a horror genre.. and Gibson did pick up the horrors of war, yet, it did not seem as natural as it was with his 'Apocalypto'.The score was appealing but I would not say the same about acting. I'd say Hugo Weaving was the best while I wish Andrew Garfield was a bit better. Vince Vaughn, an actor that I admire, was as always really funny where he should but I cannot say that his role as sergeant Howell really suits him.All in all, Gibson directed a good movie about an interesting character that defended his beliefs in and outside the battlefield.. he stood for what he believed in, did not surrender, and the hardship he went through only made him stronger, more faithful, and more of a human.",7,2,7,27 November 2016
