Ford v Ferrari," EXHILARATING!!!
",WHAT A GREAT MOVIE!!! This is what movie theaters were made for! It grabs on & holds you until the very end. Bale & Damon are fantastic together. The sound effects engulf you. I was laughing & crying....it has something for everybody.,10,3,6,18 November 2019
Knives Out," Great flick!
","Highly entertaining, great twists & storyline, with an excellent cast. Loved it!!",10,2,11,1 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," What's Not to Love?
","Pitt & DiCaprio? Yes, bring it!! I LOVE seeing Pitt's humor in his roles. Their synergy was amazing.I honestly had no idea - going in - what the movie was about, which is probably for the best, because I clearly remember the Tate-LaBianca massacres. Even with this twist that was cleverly implemented - simply knowing there was THAT connection - probably would've prevented me from buying a ticket. But, BECAUSE of the twist, the memory of that awful step in time has been flipped into a playful win for the good guys!In true Tarantino form, it was odd & interesting, & drew me in immediately. The dirty bare feet can go though & all the smoking damn near choked me out just watching! Haha!It's so difficult to for people to grasp the hazards of smoking, but after watching a person die from COPD & hearing him wish he'd quit the habit while he was young, makes my heart go out to those who struggle. It's a nasty way to die. Bodies are not exhaust pipes!",10,9,12,9 February 2020
1917," Excellent
","I always enjoy a good war movie & 1917 delivered! It was intense. It served the human factor & emotion well. Great acting, costumes & sets.",10,0,3,20 January 2020
Joker," Good, not great. Very sad.
","JP's acting was superb, but it was overrated. Many of the scenes dragged on too long. Thankfully there was far less gore & violence than implied by advertising. Just goes to show...one can't believe all the hype.",6,0,2,11 November 2019
