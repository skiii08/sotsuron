Ford v Ferrari," Well Driven & Superbly Acted
","Just when you think that Hollywood has but strained all it can out of 'American underdog victory stories', it toots out Ford vs Ferrari. Ford is struggling and bound to shut down its production line unless someone can save its ass. The idea comes, to tackle Italian giants Ferrari at the greatest endurance race, Le Mans.Enter Shelby (Damon) and Miles (Bale). Together, whilst battling their own demons, they build and drive the one and only...Mustang. The story plays out but it's both Damon and Bale that really do excel in this film. They bounce off each other with effortlessly ease, which clearly makes this an enjoyable film.Not many sports orientated films are made that are of this calibre, but every now and then you get one that hits the bullseye.",9,3,6,20 November 2019
First Man," Chazelle does it again
","With Whiplash and La La Land under the belt, Chazelle takes us on the somewhat known journey of the story we know. Ryan Gosling is quite solid in his performance, but its Claire Foy who still can put a foot wrong in another exceptional display. Now granted if you get motion sickness you may get queasy as Chazelle tries to put the audience in the drivers seat. It does give you the sense of emotion and adrenaline of the missions both on and off the land. To bring up the egotistical and narcissism in some reviews here of not showing the American flag being placed, really who cares, you still see it there. We all know who went there. Seriously go and enjoy yourselves.",9,2,8,14 October 2018
A Star Is Born," You'll go Ga Ga over this film
","The film has been made in the past and brings with it a fresh and modern twist which does touch on ideologies not only close to Lady Gaga's heart but never would have been mentioned in the past. It's because of this, it can be considered raw and real. You might need tissues as well.It begins with the writing talents of Eric Roth with Academy recognitions in the past with Munich and Benjamin Button, and a win with Forrest Gump, he brings you into the struggle of alcohol and drugs with the everyday which is life.Cooper himself highlights the above with a touching and heavy performance. The story though of course centres around Ally (Lady Gaga) and she was exemplary, just fantastic, and ending with a climactic performance. Others supporting including Sam Elliot and Dave Chappelle carry right through this film.An incredible directorial debut from Bradley Cooper with A Star Is Born. Enjoy.",10,0,1,23 November 2018
Captain Marvel," Endgame Is Set
","People have certainly overthought and incorrectly reviewed this film. Absolutely harsh. You could easily compare this to Attack of the Clones, its merely a fill in for what's to come. The difference is, this one is good.Firstly the soundtrack was spot on, taking you back to the mid nineties when people actually played instruments. Back to the film... this is not about feminism (thats Alita), its just about a super hero like all the other marvel films.Its amazing when Peter Parker and Bruce Banner are getting used to how their power works, its fine, but when Carol does it people day its fluffing around. Storyline is far better than Aquaman.The acting is fine, Brie Larson has no problem making her character likable and truthful. With Jackson, Benning, Law and Mendolhson the acting is all good (dont listen to others). At the end of the day its all now set for the grand finale. No spoilers here, make your own mind up.",9,3,12,28 March 2019
Us," It could have achieved much more
","'Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold I will bring evil upon them, which they'll not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken onto them'. The passage is right over everywhere in this film, its up to you to figure it out.We begin in 1986 in Santa Cruz amusement park with little Adelaide confused and inquisitive about her environment, she proceeds to leave her family. The walk leads to the always hall of mirrors that gets these tales going. Move ahead 34 years, Adelaide and family go to (yes you guessed it) the woods. The usual horror/thriller etiquette takes place and well you probably know the result.The initial quote above does have relevance in the film that we can interpret what the evil may be. Is it cloning? Is it mind control?, whatever it may be, this is where its a little flat. Its more content on trying to keep the chills then the thrills. It's not a waste of time, but it's no Get Out.",6,1,2,14 April 2019
Aquaman," Better By DC
","Ok lets get this straight, Aquaman is a decent enough film. There is plenty to be excited about and its visually spectacular. Hell if we went by the first ten minutes this would be a ten. DC always does what DC does, thats take itself too seriously. Ant Man and Deadpool are perfect examples from Marvel where you practically take the piss out of yourself and still be great. DC are known for darkness are mystery, Aquaman is meant to be light hearted.
This movie in particular as stated earlier starts off excellent, character development and storyline. Also off the bat Jason Momoa is perfect for the role with his wit and general persona. The actual main plot is very thin though (even for Dolph Lundgren standards). Im by no means saying dont go, however just lower your expectations a little bit. Its overly long for what it needs to be.",7,1,5,27 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," End Of An Era
","For me this is 42 years of nine movies telling one large story. Yes its conveluted and disjointed and leaves some questions open, but it's Star Wars. Many will vent their anger and call for blood, they will blame Disney and J J Abrams, they'll give low scores. Don't listen to them.There will not be spoilers here. We do start with the continue of angst between Rey and Supreme leader Kylo Red after the death of Snoke. When you thought he was dead Empreror Palpatine returns and is determine for the Sith to rule by giving rise to the 'final order'. Kylo will wrestle with his own demons on his spiritual journey. Will Rey find out who she is? Is there Good in our Supreme leader?At the end of the day it will never be better than the three originals. As I said it doesn't matter, it's more than a fitting end to saga that has fulfilled many lives for the past and generations to come.",9,8,20,20 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Words Cannot Describe How Brilliant This Is
","In 1975 the critics described their hit song as arrogant and self indulgent. They were wrong. Now today the critics of the film are wrong again. Lets start with the unbelievable performances. Rami Malek is superb as Freddy Mercury and has every possibility for an Oscar nod or even win. Brian, Roger and John also carry their roles with breathless ease. Whether the story is fact or fiction almost becomes irrelevant as you are taken in this emotional rollercoaster as Freddy struggles internally with his love of his life vs his bisexuality. This is where Rami excels in his performance. Finally the music, its a queen dream on many levels. The scene at Wembley has to be worth the entry fee alone. So I wont stop you now, just get on your bikes and ride.",10,4,6,7 November 2018
Avengers: Endgame," The finale it deserved
","In all honesty there is no recollection of any Marvel movie that can and did deliver on the full rollercoaster of emotions. I mean yes there is the strongest of possibilities you will cry in an Avengers movie.Endgame I'm sure you don't have to be told is set after Infinity War, infact five years after, we see how the surviving gang have been impacted by the loss of their friends from the actions of Thanos. From there they take us on a journey of how they can fix their wrong. You wont even recognise that three hours have passed as it keeps you fully engaged.Without giving too much away you will see how the next adventures may transpire and why there is a Guardians 3 coming. Really if you're a fan of the franchise you're going to see this anyway, so.......
There will be no spoilers here (#dontspoilendgame).",10,2,5,4 May 2019
Toy Story 4," Yes We CANADA
","If you thought the end of Toy Story 3 made you cry, well hold my beer, you are in for a roller coaster of emotions. This is the film that didn't have to be made, but be mighty glad it was.We are taken back to nine years where Bo is given up and becomes the 'lost toy', a concept that Woody cant grasp until we transfer to Andy as a young adult passing his toy on to young girl named Bonnie. Here is where the story truly starts when she makes her first toy named 'Forky'. The story will help the understanding of the how your toys create your memories.The second part to the story takes place in an antique store aptly named second chance. We meet the doll Gabby whom i like all toys and want her own kid, Harmony. The life learning messages for children in this film kick into overdrive with this part of the film. Especially around rejection and self belief.Yes you will cry. Yes you will laugh. Yes you will enjoy.",9,1,3,9 July 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Hollywood 1 - Manson 0
","In his ninth film Tarantino still does what he does best, tell a great story. Even if you are not familiar with the Hollywood murders of 1969, the slight irregularities of fact and fiction will not stop the happenings on 10050 Cielo Drive from becoming a part of your ride.Meet Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) a stereotyped bad ass actor and his buddy and stunt double/wife killer Cliff (Brad Pitt). As luck has it Rick gets a lucky break in doing Spaghetti Westerns in Rome, meets a girl buys a condo and decides Cliff and him must part ways. This is not before a drunken bender on August 8th 1969. Intertwined in this tale we meet Gypsy, Sadie and the friends of the 'Manson Family' at their ranch as they are told to kill 'the pigs' by the leader Charlie Manson. Very little time is devoted to this but you are made aware all the same.I will not give away the twist as it has to be seen and enjoyed as its pure Tarantino. As far as the acting its Brad that takes it by the horns and gives an exceptional performance. Leo is solid too with many gripping moments. Cameos of Kurt Russell, Luke Perry and Al Pacino were also good.It was great that Tarantino gave the family and Charlie nothing and gave August 8th 1969 back to Hollywood.",10,29,47,15 August 2019
1917," Mendes Shines Again
","Twenty years ago Sam Mendes changed story telling by doing a film around a dysfunctional american suburban family winning an Oscar with American Beauty. In 2020 he may have struck Gold again with this beautifully shot and inspirational story in 1917.Done entirely in what seems to be three seperate shots (not seen to this detail since Rope) we are with our characters throughout the whole story of two British military officers charged with the operation to deliver the message to stop an assault on the German Army. The realism is there as Mendes puts you there with every heartbeat and breath felt as they feel it.The fact is, this film potentially will get best picture and deservedly so.",10,7,12,12 January 2020
Joker," If You See Only 1 Film This Year.........This Is It.
","From the moment the teaser feast our eyes you would never be mistaken to feel this movie could be almost pretentious. It couldn't be further from the truth. This hands down is a masterpiece. It's dark, mysterious and disturbing. It's brilliant and its down to the performance of one man..Joaquin Phoenix.It's unusual that a film that deals with the darkness of mental health issues makes you walk out with your mind blown, wanting more. This is because Phoenix takes you with him, deep in his conscience, you want to feel empathy, you cheer him.This is not a normal DC superhero film. It's more anti-hero. There are no spoilers here, go out and enjoy and witness potentially what Oscar material is all about.",10,1,1,10 October 2019
Jojo Rabbit," It's What Stories Should Be
","If any film or story can brilliantly define the absurdity of racism with humour and emotion, Jojo Rabbit is the bomb. Taika Waititi takes us on a spiritual journey of WWII Nazi Germany with a whipping sharp wit screenplay adapted from Christine Leunens's (Caging Skies). It will make laugh till you drop then in the same breath will have you crying as the story hits you in the heart. Taika also directs and acts which adds to how incredibly insane this film is.We meet the ten year old Jojo who is keen to be part of the Nazi party and impress his hero and 'imaginary friend' Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi). Jojo goes off to train with the Hitler Youth and Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell). Through 'funny' circumstances Jojo is injured and discharged. We meet mother (Scarlett Johannsen) who is hiding a secret, a Jewish girl Elsa (Thomasin Mckenzie). This is where the story really goes to the next level as Jojo is caught between his beliefs and life unexpectancies. The friendship that eventuates is heartfelt and memorable.All the actors are fantastic with standouts from Rockwell and Mckenzie (whom should get an award nod). We are going to witness the making of a new pioneer in cinema. You will not forget the name Taika Waititi.",10,3,6,30 December 2019
Green Book," Do yourself a favour and See this GEM
","From the man that has given you comedy gold in the past, what a 180 turn. The story inspired by true events (how true is irrelevant) takes you on a heartwarming jouney of friendship and self discovery. Scripted beautifully the rollercoaster of emotion will make you laugh and cry.Viggo is brilliant in his role as the down and out of luck Italian driver, he gives his character a more than believable warmth. It's that man Mahershala Ali again...gives yet another exceptional performance. His charecter is hilarious and yet humane. Definitely worthy of his second Oscar.Watching how all the script, direction and acting tells this story keeps you engaged and captivated to the very end. Just a great film.",10,1,5,3 March 2019
