The Expendables 2," 'That does belong to a museum.' (Stalone) 'So do we!' (Arnold)
","Wow!!!!!!!! Well nothing special about the story line which has been well used in the industry for the last years (kill, kill, kill, ...).The great thing about this film is how well integrated is the 'museum' of actors. Just about nobody was left out. FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And, of course, extremely entertaining.Some new blood to keep the mix interesting.Even Van Damme made it in.Great show!I would recommend it!",9,3,4,7 October 2012
Clash of the Titans," In my 49 years of movie watching, this was the worst remake ever.
","The best title for this movie should have been 'How to screw and distort an old story'.I was extremely disappointed with the entire movie. I watched the 2D version only.There is no comparison between the 1981 version and this one. The first one was a great work all around. This, was just a very bad taste on trying to move a story forward.Bad! Bad! Bad!The original one keeps things where they should be: the gods stay away from the 'humans'.On this one, even Zeus comes to direct contact with Perseus.Geehs! A black Pegasus? That was a real turn off!!!!!!!!!!!",1,2,3,27 April 2010
