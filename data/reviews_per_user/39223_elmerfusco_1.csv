Mission: Impossible III," only the first Mission was OK
","This is NOT 'Mission Impossible!' The original show was not just action, sickening violence and blowing things up. It had an ensemble cast and plots of suspense and clever ways of tricking the enemy. This movie was a total waste of time to watch. The television show would never have lasted more than a season with such poor writing. The only good thing about MI 2 and III is the theme song. It goes downhill from there. This is nothing but a vehicle to showcase Cruise. Please spare us and don't make another. They should have stopped with the first one, which was enjoyable. If you want to make your own action/spy movies Tom, don't misuse the 'Mission Impossible' name!",2,1,2,6 February 2007
