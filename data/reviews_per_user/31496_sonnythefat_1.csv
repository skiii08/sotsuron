Hereditary," The kind of horror 'Satanic' movie from the 1970's I hate, Guess what ? I still Hate them,
","Good acting, good soundtrack, Good visuals, There was a heap on movies like this back in the Seventies, I never liked them ,Big budget like Rosemarys Baby, To low budget like Race with the Devil, (Prequel to Drive Angry ) which I do like, Drive Angry that is, The only surprise you can do with a film like this is a Deus Ex Machina, And the more outrageous the better,",2,0,3,21 March 2019
