50 First Dates," HILARIOUS!!!!!!! Yet romantic
","As i said HILARIOUS!!!!!!! yet Romantic. It was soooooooooo funny, especially all the stunts he got up to in order to get her attention, especially when he got Ula to 'mug' him, amazing. Her brother Doug brought the movie to life. And it wouldn't have been the same without Ula, no movie is complete without Rob Schneider. Alexa and the Walrus were 2 hilarious characters that are impposible to forget. It was soooooooo sweet, all the romantic dates they went on, and how he made her fall in love with him every day; why can't all men be like that these days?! It was really sad when she said she'd brake up with him though! I cried! But it was a brilliant ending to a brilliant movie. A ten out of ten in my book. I can't stop watching it! I highly recommend it if your up for a laugh and a cry. You can't stop it for anything. Thank-you for a wonderful movie!",10,0,1,28 March 2005
