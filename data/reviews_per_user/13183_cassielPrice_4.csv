Blade Runner 2049," Horrific plot
","Thanks for wasting more than 2hrs of my time which I could spend on a better movie.
You can't simply foul peoole by decorating a hollow movie with visual effects and some fancy sexy images to make them watch this and praise it. It took me 4 days to watch this movie because it was as boring as hell. The movie was just built based on short dialogues and some good scenery, and about plot and story? I'm sorry it didn't have any. First i thought it would worth it to watch the end and I at least can watch a good ending but holy crap, the movie ended right in the climax where anyone would expect joe to fight wallace and defeat him and put an end to this world of slavery once and for all, but instead we see that deckard sees his daughter after many years. Are we so mindless to watch a movie just to see an old man seeing his daughter again? Where's the point? where's the final fight? where's the ending of what you first started the movie with? Yeah right the writer has lost his way and forgot why he even did start.
I don't want to write much all i can say is that this movie was horrific in plot and story besides it's good scenery and visual effects. And about the love story within, it was totally unrelated and broken to relate and believe. The writer should have worked more on it, other than that it was just a side story for romance lovers which totally can't satisfy them. I'm done here and i hope you look deeper to this movie and see it's flaws and don't praise it pointlessly.",1,7,12,26 March 2018
Aladdin," Completely disappointing and Changing the whole story
","1- they didn't use Anwar Jibawi as the main male character.
2- Lots of unnecessary Singing and dancing that if you cut them out from the movie nothing would change at all.
3- They Changed the ending. The genie won't lose his powers and become some human. He just gets freed and still hang out with the guy. That's what we watched as kids and teens in the series and how it is written in the books.",1,54,93,14 August 2019
Logan," Honestly it was a great ending for a superhero
","Logan, as we know, is a highly rich character in personality and background knowledge we know about him. Hugh Jackman, he has done his best in this movie I could easily believe his suffering and acting because he is drowned and became one with his role.Actually, the movie and the story had the certain smell of death since the beginning. When I was watching the first minutes of the movie the scenes and the locations also had been chosen wisely they could inform us of the death, of a dramatic ending. I could see regret in Logan's eyes he is like that's enough of heroic life just let me rest in peace I don't want to fight anymore. As a fan, I've never seen him running away from his enemies he just wanted to stay away from any stress for the rest of his life.He was hopeless until Laura came in he could barely see himself in the girl so he sacrificed himself for saving her.It's hard to describe how dramatic how beautiful the scenario was the love between a father and his daughter.This time we saw a different Logan there was no glory and fighting will in him he was calm he knew it is time for him to go.After all Marvel movies have lost a legend I don't know if its possible to bring him back on the scene because Logan is still alive in comics. I can't write more here the movie is so good that you can talk about its positive points for a whole day.",9,4,11,15 May 2017
Joker," Masterpiece
",A true work of art. Heath Leadger is proud of You Joaquin. The only Joker i admire after Heath Leadger. The DC finally gave us a man worthy of Calling JOKER. The psychological storyline and thr Oscar-Worthy performance of the main actor are brilliant.,10,2,3,12 November 2019
