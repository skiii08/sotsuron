Despicable Me 2," Likable but not as good as first. A little small minded
","This movie was a little fun. Especially when the minions are involved but honestly, I am so sick of Disney/Pixar feeling they have to turn to the 'love story' as a result for creating a plot. And the fact that this film had a 'everyone should have a mommy' sub-plot in it made me really upset for all the children out there watching it that have a single-parent house-hold (which is a lot of kids out there). The original was more positive since three girls were being adopted from an orphanage (positive and an inspiration for children in an orphanage or not-so-good-household)in which all they wanted was someone to love them (which in the end happens in the original story) but now the focus has been switched to everyone has to find love to be happy 'with a significant other'. I feel this is a step backward for people's moral values. Don't get me wrong, I saw it in 3D which I would recommend (especially at the end with the Minions!!!) but if you are expecting it to exceed the original, as far as funniness, you're wrong. Otherwise, it's a good kids movie with enjoyable parts and I would definitely rent it if you have a 3D TV.",5,1,6,27 July 2013
The Shining," Kings version WAY better
","My view is that Stephen King's version of The Shinning is a lot better than Kubrics. I have read the novel and there are several things that are in the book that when you watch Kubrics version, you just say, 'What?!?!?'. For example, the woman in room 217 (although it's, what, 237 in the film?) turns into a younger female and makes out with Jack which does not make sense at all. The woman in 217 killed herself and therefore remains an old dead ghost, there was absolutely no reason to put that in there. I really do not think you can compare the two too much. Kubric's version is way different than King's. I am a fan of Kubric, and this film, but the Kubric and King were on completely different wavelengths.",8,2,5,12 April 2007
Pearl Harbor," A view from a 15-year old (please no stereotypes)
","I saw this movie in the theaters with one of my friends who swore that it was one of the greatest movies ever. Now, when someone says 'one of the greatest movies ever' I think of film titles like 'A Clockwork Orange' or 'Silence Of The Lambs' or something near that. But, since my friend was a pop-frenzy teen who generally looked for only hot guys in a movie to classify it as good, I decided to see this wondrous film.When I came out of the theater, I was extremely disappointed. This movie was awful. The only actual good scenes were battle scenes that even then were kind of boring. I found myself yawning more than often and surprised that Cuba Gooding Jr. was in it (not one of my favorite actors but, still). Also, I thought that it was extremely...weird how so  many older people on TV. said it was fantastic. This movie, I guess, is recommended to young teens who only want to see a woman lose faith and betray Ben Affleck and also see Josh Hartnett take his shirt off. It is supposed to be a tribute to the World War 2 veterans but, instead, it is an insult.",2,0,1,17 June 2002
