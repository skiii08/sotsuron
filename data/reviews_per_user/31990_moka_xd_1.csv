Hereditary," Great job
","This movie gave me the horror feeling I haven't felt for a while in the movie industry. The movie is 0% predictable which keep the tense at all time, no need to appeal to the surprising screaming of suspense genre we have seen a lot lately in movies like The Conjuring. Photography is great, well balanced, disgusting at times, acting is great. 
The mayor issue people is saying its that it is too slow, and maybe it is if you expect to have a 2hour of screaming in sunday funday, you have to enter the movie as a family character and you will be scared the brains out.Recommend it!",9,2,5,13 August 2018
