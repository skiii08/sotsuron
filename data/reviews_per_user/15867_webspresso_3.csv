The Finest Hours," Surprisingly good film without the usual A-listers
","Rather pleasant film with Chris Pine, Casey Affleck and Eric Bana. What starts as quite a slow, sweet an meandering romance quickly ramps up as the film rolls on. Pine plays a sweet, under confident young man (very well) who grows in stature as the film progresses. Amusingly, Pine's character follows the same process ... it's almost as if the parts were written for them to show their acting prowess and emerge as heroes. It's sometimes hard to praise a movie like this - it's probably not going to win any Oscars, but it's well worth watching - some very very tense moments are portrayed with exceptional realism and finesse.Don't pass this film up ...",7,0,0,10 October 2016
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Without question Tarantino's worst ever film.
","A stunningly bad film which grotesquely twists a tragic real-life story in such bad taste it's hard to believe any of the massive stars gave it a second read. And to those who claim, 'irony', then I say 'rubbish'.No plot, no connection between the numerous gratuitous, pointless vignettes and almost no script.The only saving graces were di Caprio and Point - the former was brilliant as ever, whikst the latter played Brad Pitt really well. They get a star each, the movie itself gets none.Younger viewers will not understand the shock felt by the world at the Tate murder(s) and not comprehend just how poor taste the 'happy ever ending' really is.",2,1,3,18 August 2019
The Nice Guys," Very poor script
","2 hours wasted watching this film. Thin and obvious plot with a very poor script. Definitely NOT Crowe & Reynolds' finest hour - they are both much better than this movie. Both main actors tried to carry this film off but they're just not THAT good. A cameo appearance by a completely wooden Kim Basinger did nothing for the film except line her pockets for an expressionless performance with lines that my dog could have delivered with more passion and conviction. better. Did I mention the plot was bad?I have no idea why people have rated this movie so highly; it wasn't funny (well, maybe two scenes), it was S-L-O-W and just plain rubbish. Don't waste your time.",2,9,18,9 October 2016
