The Blair Witch Project," A movie that will scar you if you let it
","For all that have been disappointed by horror films as of late should definitely see The Blair Witch Project. As we are seeing the events unfold in the first person, as well as seeing them through Hi8 video/16MM film, the realism is increased. Not to mention that at times, the actors actually show their descent into madness with each passing day. The more strange occurrences happen, the more the actors look like they are loosing their grip on reality. This translates perfectly into the audience's perceptions, and a hushed pandemonium grips the viewers. When I saw the New York advanced screening, everyone left the theater white faced and totally drained from the culmination of the picture. I don't want to give out too much about the plot, but the tag line says it all, and the ending will be the most horrific ending that anyone has exposed on film. If you let this movie into your head, you will not be right after viewing it. Just remember; it's just a movie.",Null,1,1,29 July 1999
