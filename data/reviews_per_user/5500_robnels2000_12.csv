Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the great disappointments of my life
","There were three things wrong with this movie. The most annoying one being Jar Jar and the Gungan'sWhen I saw the opening scene and heard the first spoken words by the Trade Federation characters I was disappointed, pigeon Japanese?? Then I saw their masks, I saw better on the old Planet of the Apes 2 movie. I mean this was pathetic.But where the original three movies had a story with some special effects this movie had effects with NO STORY. To make it worse the movie that was eventually released on VHS then DVD was different from the one in the theater. That's right GL edited the movie before the video release cutting out at least 3 key scenes. The few interesting sense at the junk yard and later back on Naboo when they were taken to the Gungan sanctuary were removed.If GL felt his movie was flawed then why shouldn't we think so too?This movie was just a very sad disappointment, nothing more then a cheap attempt to make money by capitalizing on legendary movie history.",3,0,1,10 August 2008
The Sound of Music," View it as a great fictional movie based very loosely on a real family.
","This movie will always be a favorite of mine for the holidays, even though I know the facts where drastically changed from that of the real Von Trap family and their story. But even with that it is a very well done and charming story. I don't usually like musicals but this one has had my attention since I was a child and has become an annual event in my family, even if I have to watch it alone I have it on every year. I even put up with the teasing I get from my friends over liking it.Back in the 90's a saw an interview with the real Maria Von Trap and she was talking about how different the movie was from her book. I never believe Hollywood when they say based on a true story that usually means they kept some of the names and none of the facts, so I decided to get her book and get the facts behind the Hollywood facts of the movie. I found the book very well written and of course very different from the movie but it never dimmed my enjoyment of the movie. I just look at the movie as a nice piece of fiction and enjoy it separately for the real story.Besides, we all know there hasn't been an original thought in Hollywood in decades.",10,3,10,28 December 2008
Unbreakable," What message did I get from this film?
","People who read comic books are crazy!Now we all know that is NOT true but from the text at the beginning of the movie and through the story line that's the message I see it sending. This could have been a MUCH better move if it had been made by any one other then Shyamalan, this hack has never done a movie I liked, they are always so predictable you could sleep through the first half and still know the whole story line. Why do they keep giving this man money to make these turds? I will never even rent one of his movies againThis is just another movie that makes people that love the super hero genre and comic books look like the dumbest people on the planet.",1,8,13,23 May 2010
Star Trek," Is this a Joke??
","A true disappointmentI had large reservations about this movie that only became larger as the previews gave more details. I am in no way a Trekkie and I have found my share of flaws in the Star Trek movies and TV shows, but even I couldn't stand the errors in this movie.To me it was like a cross between Galaxy Quest and Starship Troopers. And what star was going supernova and endangering the whole galaxy? It would have to have been enormous millions of times larger than any star we can see to directly threaten any worlds outside its own system let alone the whole galaxy. You don't need a degree in stellar physics to know that. We have seen the effects of several stars that have gone supernova in our galaxy and in nearby galaxies and none have been anywhere near that big.None of the actors had the character they were playing right and Chris Pine seemed to think the role of Kirk was nothing but a joke, Kirk was cavalier but just plain stupid was not part of the character, he wouldn't get a job as dish washer let alone ship's captain. Scotty was nothing like in the TV shows or movies; He had little or no technical abilities and was just the joke of the scenes he was in.The only character I think they had right was Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy; Karl Urban had it perfect right down to the insults and paranoia.This was more like a Star Trek parody than anything else. Did Abrams ever watch any of the Star Trek shows or movies, I haven't been this disappointed by a Star Trek movie since Star Trek the Motion Picture.",1,278,435,9 May 2009
Spider-Man 3," Too much action not enough plot
",Too much action not enough plot I was really looking forward to this movie I really loved the first two. But when it comes down to it they totally blew it. They had lots of great CGI but you had no plot development to many bad guys and not enough story behind most of them. Add to that the sub story of the relationship problems between Peter and Mary Jane there was just too much going on in one movie to tell any kind of a good story.All through this movie I got the impression that they were planning on more movies but something happened and they won't be able to make them. So instead of throwing away the stories they decided to cram them all in to one colossal disappointment. They totally sold out the great work of the first two movies.,6,2,3,29 May 2007
Knowing," Blowing
","Have you ever watched a movie and think to yourself 'I know this story.'Well then you know how I feel after seeing KnowingThink back a few years to the Twilight zone of the late 90's They did an episode almost exactly like this accepted the aliens transformed the people of earth to be able to survive. Add a few bits and pieces from other stories and you have stolen, I mean created a script.If you have seen Deep Impact, Contact, and The Outer Limits you can save your money here.One last thing, I can believe in a life form out there with enough technology to predict a solar flare like in the movie years in advance but where in the movie did they explain the other predictions??And there was nothing to explain it once the solar flare was detected.",4,6,12,21 March 2009
Pearl Harbor," Refuting the claims of inaccuracies
","I gave this movie 6 out of 10 stars for the action but when I read the reviews about being historically inaccurate I got mad.This movie did have its bad points like the bombing of the hospital and the way the cockpit scenes showed the joystick up around the pilots chin and the way they slid all over the place when the plane turned.But to address the claims of being historically Inaccurate all I can say is do some research.Yes the love triangle was totally fiction but there was a lot of fact as well.There really was an RAF Eagles squadron that took in volunteer American airman as did the French air core of WW1. It was run by the RAF and was made up of all American pilots. When the US joined the war they reverted to the US Army Air core.As to the mention of the Flying Tigers being in England under US control made by another reviewer of this movie. They Were in China and a civilian air core up until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. When the US joined the war they reverted to the US Army Air core.As for Cuba Gooding Jr. playing a token black in this movie, LOOK IT UP he was portraying a very important person in history. Doris Miller was the first African American to receive the Navy Cross for Distinguished Service.It really bugs me when someone tells you something is inaccurate but then the 'facts' they give are even more inaccurate. Look things up before you start throwing stones.",6,0,5,29 June 2008
2012," Nothing less then 1 *? Too bad
","To start out, there is no Mayan prediction saying the world will end in 2012.Their calendar just ends on the year 2012, no disaster, other than this movie. I guess 2000 years on the calendar was enough at the time.Disaster movies and horror movies are the most predictable crap Hollywood puts out. Save your money on this movie and watch Earthquake, Poseidon Adventure (the original not the remake), Knowing or even that crappie Day after tomorrow, they are all the same, bad science and over done special effects.This movie is like every other disaster movie made since the 70s. All the stereo typical characters are here. 1. The common man hero that saves his family against all odds. 2. The cute kid that you can't help but love, and is smart beyond their years. 3. The government plan to save a select few, and of course the hero is against the idea.",1,36,73,13 November 2009
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," So now the Jedi can fly through space and control weather
","This is just the latest classics that have been remade to capitalize on the past success.Hollywood can't come up with any new ideas so they take a classic, bring back one or two original cast members only to past the story to the new kids, then they get killed off. They could have left Lea out of this completely, her character did nothing for the story.As for the story line for this movie it wasted two and a half hours, this was nothing more than a movie of the week on TV. There is zero background as to where the first order comes from, how they got so strong or why they are using all the trappings of the Empire from 30 years ago. Nothing new here at all.",1,29,42,24 March 2018
Super 8," Wow Close Encounters meets ET, mix in a little jaws. Could this look like any more of Spielberg's movies?
","Just saw the most boring movie in a long time.I had a free pass so I decided to try Super 8, even though I was warned I figured what the heck it's free.I was over charged!I was bored to sleep; I fell asleep for 15 minutes and still was able to follow this turd. I have seen slow movies but this one moved like a glacier. It wouldn't have been so bad if the story was more involved, or interesting.I don't know what was dumber the woman at the town meeting blaming the Soviets for stealing her microwaves, or that it killed most people it encountered but took 3 people and hung them upside down in its layer, were they a food supply? No explanation is ever given. I think the most predictable and most unbelievable point is the fact that 6 kids solved the mystery and their parents, along with the rest of the adult cast were to blind, or dumb, to see the resolution. I half expected to see a ship shaped like a giant Christmas tree ornament at the end.",1,21,36,25 June 2011
Inception," The thinking person's movieFor people not use to thinking
","Everyone has been telling me how this movie is so complex, so confusing. That you really need to pay attention or you'll get lost.I dosed off in the middle and still knew exactly what was happening.This movie is nothing but a cross between The Matix, Dreamscape, Mission Impossible and about 3 other movies and anime films that have been coming out since the mid 1980's. The ending was the most obvious outcome it could be, you already know he doesn't except the dream version of his wife so she would be gone. But the kidsgetting home to see their faces again, they were the real focus. If you missed that in the beginning then seeing his father-in-law pick him up at the airport should have been the final tip off.Most people I ask about that missed it all; they couldn't even tell which dream was which. I think that's what scares me the most, people think this takes real intelligence to follow.Maybe if your attention deficitOh wait I am and I still had no trouble following this over rated boring movie.I gave this movie 4 out of 10 stars for special effects only, for story line and acting I give it only 2 stars",2,38,73,1 August 2010
Signs," This movie SUCKED
","I gave this movie a 1 only because there isn't a -1,000I am usually a big fan of Mel Gibson but after this I will have to reevaluate that.I watched this movie waiting for the big finally that would turn it around and make it great, or at least funny on purpose. That didn't happen until Scary Movie 3, which is far superior to the piece of junk.No one is as dense as the characters in this movie. Every event needs to be explained to them as if they are all 3 years old.Mel should go back and make Lethal Weapon 5; it can only be an improvement.",1,3,6,18 June 2006
