It," IT IS Fun!
","Before I go into as my detail as I can possibly fathom about the insanity that is IT, I confess I must take the time to state the fact that have IBS. IBS(Irritable Bowell Syndrome) makes the possessors bowels terribly sensitive, and that possessor in this case, was me. Lets just say that I had to miss a good amount of this incredible film do to my before mentioned IBS(Irritable Bowel Syndrome.) But for the parts that I did get to check out, boy, am I excited to tell you all about it.When IT was announced, the same thought came into many of our minds, how could this possibly compare to Tim Curry's performance of the Clown from Stephen Kings horrible horror filmed Macroverse? Gladly though, this was not the same approach as the lovable mini series, but an entirely different approach all together. Not only did Bill Skarsgards performance of Pennywise the Dancing Clown hold up spectacularly well on the modern silver screen, but the children each held their own incredible performance, as well. Each character had their own personal battles that IT of course fed upon, and they did not disappoint on their reactions and overall performance. When it comes to today's Superhero filled theaters, a well written script usually fall by the way side as budgets on visual effect sky rocket. I was so happy to be taken on this ride of not only amazing Visual and Special Effects, but incredible writing, as well.Speaking of Effects, I would like to go further into detail on how beautiful the cinematography was in this film. Now, I sadly have to go back to when I mentioned I have IBS(Irritable Bowel Syndrome), leading me to have to remind you that this had me out of the theater multiple times during the overall film. But whenever I did enter back into the clean movie theater, matching my clean hands, I almost had to stop in awe at the screen, slowing me from finding my chair. No matter if the movie was currently focusing on a character development scene, a moment of pure horror or even just a funny breather(which there were many that made me giggle, thanks Mike) Andy Muschietti's direction of the camera never left an eye sore, but instead always complimented a characters action, always driving the eye and pleasing the brain.I don't see many horror films due to, again, my before mentioned IBS(Irritable Bowel Syndrome(You can imagine how this may be a problem for films of the horror genre.)) But WILL have to go again, and try to time my outings to get those several beautiful, and probably very scary, scenes I missed. Thanks for reading!-Henry",10,2,3,30 October 2017
