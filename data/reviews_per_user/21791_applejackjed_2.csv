American History X," AN ABSOLUTE POWER HOUSE OF EMOTION, AND CONTROVERSY
","Director Tony Kane's American History X not only displays the brutality of racism, but how it effects your family and the conflicts that rise from casual dinner arguments, and how hatred just drags you down and doesn't do anything at all to help you solve your problems. Instead, it just creates more problems. Edward Norton has given one of the best performances of his career. He plays a Neo Nazi Skinnhead who is sentenced to seven years in prison for a horrific act of manslaughter. During his time in the joint, he befriends an inmate who happens to be black. His friendship with the inmate changes his perspective on racism and how wrong it really is. Norton's character Derek, has a little brother named Danny (Edward Furlong) who has always looked up to Derek, starts to head down the same path his older brother once did. Having the scenes of Derek being a Skinnhead, shot in black and white was an absolutely brilliant idea. Because if there is one thing black and white cinematography does now a days is present a dark and depressing tone, which is exactly what you feel when you experience these scenes. Beverly Diangelo delivers a captivating and heartbreaking performance as a widow. It had been awhile since we've seen a performance like this. Diangelo said in an interview 'this was her first take on a dramatic role.' Well let me tell you, not bad for her first take on Drama, not bad at all. American History will perhaps go down in 'History' as one the most contraversial films ever made, and one of the most brutal, other than that, it's got an honest story, captivating performances, and an extremely emotional ending. It's got all of the qualities of a great film.Grade: A",Null,0,0,22 November 2018
