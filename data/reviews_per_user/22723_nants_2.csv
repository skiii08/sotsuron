The Avengers," Banal
","Aside from a few points of humor, this movie primarily features only endless lame fighting (A knocks down B, B gets up and knocks down A, A gets up... repeat over and over and over). Apparently delightful to Marvel fans, tedious and banal to those who seek something other than the simplistic, well-worn pathway to adolescent male fantasy. Yes, the special effects were well done, though somewhat inconsistent -- why is the Hulk so huge in some scenes, so human-scale in others? Why does the Hulk fear his monster's uncontrollability, when it seems perfectly coordinated with the other superheroes during the fighting, and perfectly peaceful afterward? Why is there no character development whatsoever? Oh, right, it's Marvel. Superheroes in stasis. Throwbacks to a stupider time. I kept waiting for it to get interesting... and then it was over. ::sigh::",3,9,29,10 May 2012
Gravity," Disappointing
","I wanted to see this movie both for it's supposed realistic depiction of the physics of space and the interaction of lots of bodies in motion, but also because I have long enjoyed Sandra Bullock and George Clooney's movies. The special effects do not disappoint. The 3D augments without overwhelming, despite the enormous potential given the subject matter - kudos on that. The visual ride is exhilarating and pleasing. While the special effects are superb, the story is anything but. I found myself becoming deeply offended by the way Sandra Bullock played her role, showing excessive weakness for an accomplished woman in her position. It felt like a throw-back to some 1950s production. The effect was further heightened by Clooney's cloying Daddy-ness, also unbelievable for a professional astronaut, who might be expected to be confident and even macho, but to play such an over-the-top patriarchal figure exceeded my ability to suspend disbelief. And for Bullock's professional woman to simply fall into his protective dominion seemed far-fetched at best. Overall, I found the stale gender stereotypes a major turn-off that ruined the film for me. Even though the heroine finds her grit, it's not enough to erase all the weakness that comes before. As a lover of old Clint Eastwood etc, I am not unable to enjoy macho men or girly girls. But this one seemed such a throwback I emerged not just disappointed, but sincerely irritated.",5,4,9,5 October 2013
