Come and See," The Greatest Anti War Movie Ever Made
","Come and See is by any definition probably the greatest anti war movie ever made. Its strips away the bravado and flag waving found in a conventional war films and shows in graphic, awful detail, the savage reality of war. This is not a film to come to lightly. Its deeply disturbing and in no small measure upsetting. What it does achieve and it does so humbly and without pretense, is to dissuade anyone from the perspective that war is something to be wanted and embraced. The acting is superb and the story is, sadly, historically accurate. You will never look at war the same way after watching this film. Ten out of ten from me.",10,5,6,18 June 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," Worthwhile thriller with a sci fi twist....
","10 Cloverfield Lane in one sense, plays on the Socratic notion of allegory of the cave. What exists beyond the confines of the bunker the key characters of this film find themselves in? Is there anything beyond the bunker, if so, how do you know?Leading on from this, can the heroine of the piece trust her apparent savior who she is forced to share the bunker with? Is he what he appears to be or is he a monster? Is it worth finding out what, if anything, exists beyond the bunker? Does this unknown risk outweigh any perceived risk, her bunker companions may present? This is premise this thriller is built upon and, indeed, for the most part, this film is more thriller, than sci fi. The tension is gradually ratcheted up, as 'what if' suspicions are raised, dropped and then raised again. This is a well acted film with solid performances by the cast but its in no way an exceptional film. 'Interesting' is a good way of describing 10 Cloverfield Lane. It engages the viewer in much the same way, as a competently directed and acted 'who dunnit'. You start asking questions and keep watching to see if you can work out where the film is going. To be honest, for the most part, this film is fairly predictable. I'd guessed quite early on what was happening but was caught out, to a degree by the final, final ending. I did not see it coming but, its unlikely anyone would. That said, it is hinted at in the film itself, so keep you ears and mind open as you watch. All in all, a worthwhile thriller with a sci fi twist. Seven out of ten from me.",7,1,5,28 March 2016
The Equalizer," Makes me miss Edward Woodward
","Edward Woodward's The Equalizer downplayed the violence that lay at the core of the character. Violence was a necessary evil but it was presented as something employed with regret and a certain analytic, constrained precision. Its a shame then that whilst this updated film attempts to convey the same sentiment it fails to follow through, taking almost boastful glee in the often ugly violence dished out by its main character played by Denzel Washington. To add insult to injury the story line is hackneyed and predictable. US arm of the Russian mob threatens young girl who they cruelly exploit as a prostitute. The result Washington's character rides in to save her. Along the way our hero uncovers corruption involving people in high places, etc, etc. In summary the original Equalizer worked because it was slick and sophisticated with understated violence that made the main character appear even more intimidating. By contract this production uses a club where a scalpel would have been more appropriate. The only bright spot being Washington himself who is as engaging and talented as ever, holding this film together in spite of its shortcomings. A five out of 10 but only just....",5,0,2,10 December 2014
It," IT's back and better than ever.....
","I would not have thought a new version of IT could much improve on the original but I was very, very wrong. The newest film iteration of the novel by Stephen King actually improves on the 90's film. It does do many of the same things but it does so in a way that's somehow fresh and has an exuberance and optimism, that inexplicably sits comfortably alongside the fear and horror that IT evokes. This is in many ways a very hopeful film about friendship with the cast of youngsters who face off against the malignant horror very much front and center. Their courage in the face of an appalling otherworldly monster, nicely captures the tone of the book. Casting for this film has been handled with great care. The chemistry between the self confessed 'losers' a small group of social outcasts could not be better. Equally, IT is even scarier. It's playful, child like nuances and mannerisms are deeply disturbing, when juxtaposed with its savagely sadistic, predatory nature. Suffice to say, IT's back and better than ever. Looks like we might be in for a sequel too. I personally can't wait! Eight out of ten from me.",8,1,3,12 October 2017
Lone Survivor," Jingoistic overtones rob this film of its anti war message
","Its lamentable that whilst Lone Survivor might be viewed as a anti war film it could just as easily be perceived as a ringing endorsement for the US military. The plot of the film is simple enough, a group of special forces soldiers are sent to Afghanistan to assassinate a militia leader with ties to the Taliban. Due to poor planning, dodgy equipment and a general lack of resources however the mission is doomed to failure. What follows is visceral, disturbing and above all very sad. Even if like me you are not from the United States you can not help but feel considerable sympathy as you watch a group of young men horrifically slaughtered as they take on an overwhelmingly larger enemy force.Whats really troubling about Lone Survivor is it stubbornly refuses to shed the jingoistic overtones that could have lifted this film above the raft of other US made war movies. Questions about the waste of human life and potential, the political validity of wars fought on foreign soil,that are inherent in this film are drowned out by the 'rah rah and hoopla' about God and country. I can not as a consequence recommend this film. Indeed I'd go so far as to say it's an irresponsible film that romanticizes war, perpetuating the myth that dying on the field of battle is something other than bloody, gruesome and ultimately pointless.",Null,15,33,31 December 2013
Fury," Horrors of war drama that falls short of the mark
","CONTAINS SPOILERS: Fury is a drama about a US tank team in war torn Europe. Brad Pitt leads a motley bunch who have managed to survive the carnage of war in spite of the stated inferiority of US armour in the face of German tank technology. Without going into too much detail what appears to be the focus of the drama, that is, showing the horrors of war, is lost due to the unlikable cast of characters and a rather absurd end scene. The tank team, with the exception of Pitt's character and that of a young recruit can, in my estimation, best be described as repellent. They are cruel, crude and a generally unsavory bunch. I suspect the reason for depicting the key characters in this manner was to show how war hardens people.Yet the reality is they could have been, I feel, better presented as human beings surrounded by the horrors of war. The lack of likability of the majority of the tank team makes it difficult to empathize with the characters when they do inevitably meet their end. For me this deadens the message the film is trying to convey about the horrors of war. The ending does the film no favours either. Pitts character stands Rambo-esque atop his immobile tank cutting down hordes of, seemingly suicidal, German soldiers. Its a 'hero moment' not I felt a reality of war scene. Indeed even when a German sniper finally shoots Pitt's character at relatively close range he turns out to be an implausibly poor shot. Its these rather glaring shortcomings and others that really rob this film of its impact which is a shame as it could have had a lot to offer with a good cast and very good locations.",5,2,10,8 December 2014
Captain Marvel," Watchable shake and bake superhero stick.....
","Captain Marvel is yet another in a long production line of what I call 'shake and bake' super hero flicks.Its not bad as such. You just have to accept going in that what you are getting is much the same formula that you will find with most other superhero franchise films.This is good guy vs bad guy stick with lots of special effects and things going 'boom'.The typical, drawn out, chocolate box, US folk-sey thing was mercifully kept to a minimum and something of a twist was thrown in. Taken together, this helped the pacing of the film and removed a little of the bland predictability normally associated with this kind of fare.There has been criticism of the acting from some quarters. I'm inclined to disagree. Action sci fi films like this one are more about exposition which tends to limit the potential for actors to really offer up stand out performances. Samuel L Jackson as always provides some welcome comic relief as did the 'cat' (watch the film and see if you don't agree with me).In short Captain Marvel is what you expect it to be and what you get is, to be fair, quite watchable. 6/10 from me.",6,13,19,26 May 2019
Passengers," Excellent....
","My wife and I sat and watched this one and we were both impressed. I have become rather jaded with regards to Hollywood productions, so I was pleasantly surprised by Passengers. Its a simple adaptation of a Robinson Crusoe style epic with a space setting and a romantic twist. Its a combination that works exceedingly well, aided by very down to earth scripting and narrative and strong characterization.Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt's chemistry is wonderful. It sparkles and bring this film to life with emotional and funny moments that work well, alongside some well timed action. All in all there is a heck of a lot to like here and little to criticize, aside from a slightly weak ending. Eight out of ten from me.",8,1,4,3 March 2017
Green Room," Pointless violence......
","In my opinion Green Room is an exercise in pointless violence. In spite of the inexplicable presence of Patrick Stewart, there's really nothing to recommend this film. From the dismal, 'low life' atmosphere, through to the pointless, often gratuitous violence and the improbable story, that feels stitched together, this is, in my opinion, a real pickled stinker of a film. Some have called this film a thriller but I'm at a loss to see how it qualifies for that title. I'd say ugly, unlikable, survival horror is probably closer to the mark. Two out of ten from me and mostly for some of the reasonable acting, in an unreasonably weak film.",2,14,34,19 July 2016
The Babadook," A metaphor for ones inner demons
","DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH MY INTERPRETATION COULD BE SAID TO CONTAIN SPOILERS. Without giving too much away the main theme of this movie is not an imaginary monster come to life. The true theme of this film is traumatic loss, how we cope or fail to cope with it and how, if possible, we somehow reconcile our inner demons. Its clear from the outset that the main character has, in fact, tragically and irrecoverably failed to deal with her personal demons. If you pay close attention I do not think this can in any way be denied. The final scene really spells out what has happened. Like the young boys magic tricks its hardly real. Its the conjuring of a fevered mind wanting to wash away the awful reality of what it has done and replace it with a beautiful, if illogical, fantasy. There is a secondary theme here too about the manner in which family, employers and authorities treat those who are under extreme pressure as a result of loss. Its damning assessment too, one that speaks stridently and honestly of indifference and selfishness. There are no happy endings in the Babadook. Its a hard, sad watch but also very compelling and emotional. There is a positive message too for those willing to listen. Don't ignore others suffering, don't turn your back, expect better from yourself personally, from those around you and your government. A timely message in an age where people seem to care less and less about one another. What more can I say. Yet another superb Australian film that employs an exceptional cast and is masterfully directed. Ten out of ten from me.",10,7,15,4 January 2015
The Irishman," Stale Fellas.....
","Stale is the kindest thing I think of to say about 'The Irishman'.The reality of producing essentially the same 'shamrock and spaghetti' gangster flicks, over and over again, is eventually, they become their own. horribly dated. cliche.Such is the case with 'The Irishman'. It offers nothing new but then how could it? Its a factual organised crime tale that's not even half as interesting as its marketed. Worse still, its doing something we have all seen from Scorsese many times before. With much the same actors to boot. Why no new talent to invigorate things, at least a little?To add to the misery, its overly long, essentially repeating the same tiresome patterns; 'rob, bribe, intimate, kill', rinse out the blood and repeat. You can only experience this a limited number of times before it becomes psychologically numbing.In short, a safe choice of actors, excessively long, repetitive and a somewhat boring.5/10 from me.",5,3,6,15 March 2020
Point Break," A shallow remake of a vastly superior classic.....
","The 2015 remake of the classic Point break is a shallow reinterpretation of the original film. The new film is bereft of the ingredients, that made the original film, starring Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves, so watchable. What is most noticeable, is the lack of chemistry between the lead characters, that was so carefully constructed, between the undercover Reeves and the thrill seeking, criminal Swayze. Just as absent, is the well developed storyline, that, in the original film moved gradually to a worthwhile climax but, in the remake, looses its momentum and fizzles out, in the closing scenes. The acting is nothing special either. For the most part, it feels like the actors are going through the motions but not really handing in anything that looks like a good let alone outstanding performance. To be fair, this is partly due, to rather bland narrative, infected with pseudo religious rite of passage, nonsense, which centers around taking extreme life threatening risks, to become one with nature.So if there an upside here? The action sequences and special effects are well handled. There is no shortage of thrills and they are, for the most part, executed in polished fashion. Sadly, that's pretty much all that's on offer here. Watch Point Break for the thrills and spills, by all means just don't expect a lot else here. Five out of ten from me.",5,0,2,25 March 2016
BlacKkKlansman," Cherry picks the facts to fit a political agenda.....
","I'll start by saying the actual film itself is very watchable and enjoyable. The acting is excellent, the story line clever and original. Its also deeply sad and at times, extremely funny, in equal measure. Its nice to see people deriving a kind of wry humour from what is a legacy of, at times, downright nasty, discrimination.Now comes the 'but'. Its unfortunate that this film doesn't let the story it tells speak for itself. Instead, it elects to stifle its powerful message by overlaying a pretty obvious political one. One that seems intent, in my opinion, on blaming one side of the political spectrum for the woes of establishment discrimination.Here's a few facts that don't fit that picture. David Duke first ran for the Democrats before switching to the Republicans (its all up on Wikipedia if you wish to fact check). It was the Republicans who voted to end slavery and both the Confederacy and the Union supported segregation and the North tacitly supported slavery. To say racial discrimination is somehow a Southern mindset, is misleading.The truth is the US has a long history of establishment support for all manner of discrimination. Social, racial, economic and philosophical (just look at 50's style McCarthyism which seems to be making a come back). To try to imply things are suddenly 'different' ignores the fact that 'nothing ever really changed' no matter which party or President was or is in office.Its such a shame too, because this film was almost, almost there, with a powerful message of hope for tolerance and understanding. What a genuine shame. 7/10 from me.",7,3,7,30 October 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Teenie Superhero Angst.....
","If your age demographic is somewhere between 13 -16 you may actually be able to relate to Spider-Man (or is that Spider-Boy) Homecoming.This film is chocked full of truly gruesome 'teenie angst' as poor little teen Spider boy moves ever so awkwardly towards spidery adulthood. The pimply clichés culled from almost any, 'coming of age' codswallop you care to mention come thick and fast, leaving this mature viewer, squirming uncomfortably in their seat. What this means, in my opinion, is this film has very narrow appeal. Its unsophisticated fare that may not even engage more switched on teens and is certainly not accessible, to mature viewers, like myself either. On the upside the acting is passable and the action scenes are competent but really those factors on their own are not enough to make this film anything other than bland fare at best. Five out of ten from me.",5,22,36,1 October 2017
Suicide Squad," Suicidal tedium.....
","It never ceases to amaze me how so much hype and money can be spent to produce something that, in my opinion, is fundamentally tedious.Suicide Squad commits harakiri early in the piece.It opens with glacial speed offering up thick slices of cynically self important, US establishment blather. The bureaucratic puffery is broken up by what I can only describe as bland, formulaic action 'spam'. Canned action sequences, made more gruesome by utterly uninteresting, often cretinous, characterizations.For me this set the tone for the whole film which limps from uninteresting scene to scene before finally and mercifully expiring, after 123 minutes.To be honest I was not going to wait that long for this thing to put a gun to its own head and walked out half way through. Perhaps the only good thing to come from this experience was to reaffirm my belief that my time is valuable. That includes my free time. My advice, take your entertainment 'seriously' and seek out worthwhile films that offer up action but also, at least, a modicum of intelligence, wit and genuine flair. Two out of ten from me.",2,0,4,17 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," May the farce be with you....
","How to rejuvenate the flagging Star Wars franchise? How about recycling the characters, ideas and the broad story line from the original films?Well that's essentially what you get. Starting with digging up the empire and its dead leader the emperor. An emperor who is there to compensate for the insipid, weenie Darth Vader knock off, Kylo Ren, whose helmet makes him look like a mildly amusing aardvark.Nothing new, nothing original, just the same old thing over and over with new less interesting characters and a few tired retreads.The only upside is the improved special effects and some decent acting. That said, this is really not enough to carry this film over the finish line.5/10.",5,9,16,30 December 2019
American Sniper," Simplistic and fraught with contradiction
","I'm not going to spend too much time on this film as in my opinion there is not a lot worth saying. This is war movie that may appeal to a specific US demographic but, based on my experience, I question whether if it will appeal to those outside the US. American Snipers simplistic jingoistic overtones combined with its shallow, sanctimonious religiosity and lack of respect for humanity in general is a caustic thread that runs the length or this dreary, depressing and at times genuinely callous film. There is also a minor but rather nasty dash of throw away misogyny offered up early on to round things out. What really stood out for me however was the glaring contradictions found throughout this flick. A US citizen defending their country is a patriot, a person from the Middle East defending their lands is a terrorist. Killing over 150 people including children is treated as somehow heroic rather than an awful consequence of war. Why? Why too is the US in the Middle East to start with and why is this a good thing? Aside from vague references to the attacks on the US on September 11th (which had virtually nothing to do with Iraq) this is not explained or justified. Why too is the key characters emotional issues that eventually result from the work he does never really examined or reconciled? In my estimation its high time Mr Eastwood put away his directors chair. Three out of ten from me and only because the acting is not totally dreadful, even if the film is.",3,120,252,8 January 2015
Ant-Man," A lot for so little....
","Its a shame so much money was spent on so little. I'm not talking about the premise of the movie, a microscopic super hero. No I'm talking about the dismal film, Ant Man, represents. This film, in spite of its budget and reasonable cast, feels a hell of a lot like a badly made B-Grade flick. The kind that goes straight to television. The acting is hammy and melodramatic, the storyline tedious and formulaic and the action badly timed and somehow, rather awkward and clumsy. In fairness, this is not easy subject matter to migrate from comic book to big screen. The notion of a super hero who can shrink in size is a tough one requiring very careful handling and timing. The fact the subject matter is tossed around like a football is the reason its such a mess. My advice, give this one a miss. Two out of ten from me.",2,48,97,24 August 2015
Justice League," A lack of imagination is Hollywood's failing......
","Justice League, for me, really underscores how unimaginative Hollywood has become. This film is yet another super hero cliche that exhaustively walks the same predictable path as any other film in the genre. Character development is more or less missing, there.'s no real personal insight, nor any attempt to offer any depth or variety of story line. The result is a forgettable, uniform experience, that begs the question; 'why bother'? We of course know the answer is no doubt profit but really why can't financial and creative imperatives sit side by side? They did once upon a time when Hollywood produced wonderful, creative films, that were fresh and imaginative and yes, profitable. In summary, watchable, wholly predictable, with a focus on exposition and action eye candy but don't expect much else or you will be disappointed. 5/10 from me.",5,1,3,26 February 2018
Split," Familiar and unfamiliar......
","Split is both familiar and unfamiliar.The most obvious film to compare Split to is Hitchcock's Psycho.That said, Split does at least one new thing, Psycho never did and does so, for the most part, with considerable deftness. Without spoiling things, the contentious psychology associated with split personalities is taken a step further and infused, with a supernatural elements. Its a clever mechanism, that lets ice cold dread slowly seep into the this film as it gradually unfolds. For the most part, you can see where this film is going but its still 'jump in your seat' terrifying, when the moment of real horror, finally arrives. I think a special mention needs to be made of the performance by James McAvoy. He's simply exceptional in the role of Kevin, a man who appears, on the surface, to have multiple personalities, when in fact its clear something far more awful is going on. Perhaps, my only criticism here, is the handling of the end of this film. Personally I felt, the physicality of the final scenes of this film, would have best been cast aside in favour of a 'less is more', approach.Seeing the victims reaction to an unseen horror, they are finally confronted with, would have offered, I believe, far more emotional impact. Not to mention being more in keeping with M. Night Shyamalan's typical approach to direction.That said, this remains an excellent film, that's really quite special. Nine out of ten from me.",9,1,10,28 January 2017
The Intouchables," Kind hearted and genuinely funny
","Every now and again you come across a film that makes you feel good to be human. Intouchables is one such film. The subject matter sounds depressing. A moneyed man who is disabled and seems very much alone in the world. A carer who seems not to care. A feral, street savvy, young black man, who the world has taught to look after number one. What blossoms between these unlikeliest of companions is a friendship that touches on the best of human emotions. Kindness, compassion, mutual care and above all a wry sense of humour in the face of adversity. Indeed, this is surprisingly, a comedy. Both of the lead characters are, at their core, a pair of rascals who enjoy having a good time. And what a time they have!I do not remember smiling or laughing so much in a very long time. Or, for that matter, being so honestly touched by this thoroughly unpretentious film. The acting is superb. The chemistry between the leads is amazing. I can not recommend this film enough. I'm only able to rate this film ten out of ten. But really saying this film is just excellent does not do it justice.",10,1,4,20 February 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Runs out of ideas early on.....
","Captain America Civil War runs out of ideas early on. This is a an action film that promises a full on civil war between the Marvel stable of action hero's but what you get instead, could best be described as a 'bit of a dust up'. The result is a action film that never really goes anywhere. Its sort of 'OK' but like so many films in this genre, its real shortcoming is a lack of imagination and a slavish adherence to a formula that's been done to death. In short, whilst this film is not utterly boring, its hardly interesting either. Its a deeply superficial watch, that relies on eye candy, a little well scripted but predictable action and a few special effect 'novelties' to carry it. Five out of ten from me.",5,7,17,19 May 2016
Avengers: Endgame," Watchable......
","The comic book hero genre is what I call 'bulk viewing'. A mass produced product that has a formula that's repeated over and over, with a few tweaks here and there, to keep the viewer coming back for more.Avengers: Endgame is yet another case in question. I knew it going in and was in no way surprised by a predictable end to a mostly predictable story.Its not bad as such. In fact, if you can accept it for what it is, its quite watchable on a superficial level. I'll add I'm not a film snob I enjoy a simple action romp from time to time and this certainly comes recommended.There's a lot of wall to wall action that's well paced and keeps kicking along. My only gripe is the overcooked ending, that's so syrupy and sentimental, you could spread it on toast.7/10 from me.",7,2,5,11 May 2019
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Mildly Amusing Comedy of Errors Horror
","Dale and Tucker is a comedy of errors that see's two harmless hillbilly's mistaken for Deliverance style serial killers by a group of vacuous college students on vacation.Its a rather interesting premise that gradually unfolds as various innocent and often benevolent actions taken by the hillbilly's are misinterpreted by the college kids. The misunderstandings build and then escalate infecting both sides, who come to believe, for different reasons, that the other group is out to get them. The result, predictably, is mayhem. The humour is of the physical kind. Set piece scenarios that lead to bloody, gruesome, if accidental deaths that intentionally pay homage to gruesome murders found in serious horror flicks. Its not terribly believable but its not supposed to be, its slapstick and proud of it. Dale and Tucker tries to emulate films such as Home Alone but with sharp teeth. This film however only ever aspires to the humor found in flicks like Home Alone. Its no where near as creative or clever in its use of slapstick violence. As a result the mounting deaths start to become rather repetitious, unnecessarily bloody and a little dull. That said Tucker and Dale isn't dreadful. Its a nice idea that would have shone with sharper execution (pardon the pun). The key hillbilly leads are very likable and carry their roles convincingly. The students suitably snooty and foolish. So take a look by all means but don't come to this flick with high comedic expectations or you will be disappointed. Six out of ten from me.",6,2,7,6 January 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," A franchise is a franchise is a franchise.....
","The biggest problem facing franchises is the fact they are a franchise. They offer up a product that looks and acts in a certain way and the net result of that, is it can be very, very hard to reinvent that proposition in a manner that's new and novel. This is precisely the dilemma I believe is inherent in Avengers:Infinity Wars. If this was the first film of its kind it would probably have gotten peoples attention for presenting an outlandish and to a degree stylish concept, that's new and fresh. Unfortunately, there is nothing new in this formula and its been a long, long time since its been fresh. The premise is effectively always much the same. Super skilled heroes versus one or more super skilled villains, with the stake being the salvation of a country, a planet, the universe. That's pretty much it. This film does deviate a little from the expected theme, with a surprise ending but that's not enough to save it from being yet another film in a franchise that looks 'all the same'. On the upside the special effects are excellent and there is some reasonable if not show stopping acting from the collected cast. That I'm afraid is it. I do sympathise with the production house, its hard to know what to do with this concept or where to take it next. I certainly have no answer. That said this film is what it is. I've seen it all before and I'd be hard pressed to want to see it all again. 5/10 from me.",5,6,12,30 July 2018
Behind The Candelabra," The loneliness behind the glitz.....
","As a child I remember Liberace popping up from time to time on TV. Somehow even back then there was something 'unsettling' about the man. It had nothing to do with his sexuality, as I child that mean't little to me. What I do remember is thinking the facade the man presented to the world hid something rather sad and empty. Behind the Candelabra, offers up an image of Liberace as a man who appears to have everything but, in fact, has nothing. Liberace as he admits himself, is a marketing product, Lee as he prefers to be called, worked very hard to create. There is too, no denying the man's musical talent or his intellect. His sharp humour and insight can not easily be dismissed. That said, for all his material success, his glitzy shows, expensive cars, overstated mansions and young paramours, Liberace was a lonely, isolated figure. Liberace is a victim of his own success and the times he lived in. He can not openly admit his sexual preferences for fear of losing his career and he can not be sure who his friends are and who is simply out to take advantage of his considerable wealth (for the large part of his time in show business he was the highest paid entertainer in the world). The result as this film ably shows, is a man who leads a strained, sad, rather superficial existence. Surrounded for the most part by quislings and hanger on's. A man so worried about his outward appearance he resorts to plastic surgery that leaves him sleeping with his eyes partly open. Indeed, even his partner Scott Thornson, is compelled to have surgery to look more like Liberace. It seems the only person Liberace can really trust in and have any measure of love for, is himself. Its a sad tale, with beautiful sets and a very camp feel to it. Michael Douglas hands in a excellent, if slightly overstated, performance as Liberace. Personally, I felt Matt Daemon was somewhat more convincing, as Liberace's partner, Scott Thorson.All in all this is an excellent, very interesting film, that explores the unglamorous reality that lurks behind the glitzy veneer of the US entertainment industry.

A Quiet Place," Silence screams
","A Quiet Place is in one sense a contradiction. Quiet infers peaceful but as we see there is nothing peaceful about this film. The pastoral farming locale where this film is shot with its green fields, corn and folksy, homely dwellings, whispers of an idyllic, gentle life. Yet as we know from the films opening scenes this is an illusion, that belies the tense reality faced by a family under siege from an inexplicable predatory enemy, that kills at the slightest sound. This is a clever piece of film making that uses silence to increasingly ratchet up the tension nerve wracking notch by nerve wracking notch. The result is the viewer is left holding their breath wondering when someone will inadvertently violate the unspoken taboo and make a sound. I loved the way the lack of spoken dialogue was compensated for by using sign language. The families familiarity with signs is convincingly explained too with the addition of a hearing impaired daughter. Her impediment without giving anything away is crafted into the films finale in a rather clever twist that turns everything on its head.Is there a downside to this film? Perhaps from a purely logical point of view the degree of acuity of the creatures who hone in on the slightest sound is a little overstated. if they could really hear this well the family would be dead the first time someone passed wind or sneezed. Putting this very minor consideration aside this is still really fantastic film making that uses subtle terror in place of the gore so often found in the horror genre. Suffice to say its a much better film for it. 8/10 from me.",8,3,8,22 May 2018
Ex Machina," Aspirational but....
","Ex Machina aspires to much but in the end achieves less than it set out to. This film is well structured, capably acted and directed. Its a polished production and its by no means a poor film. The reality, however, is its not really doing anything with its story line that has not been done more competently before. The underlying message of the threat technology poses to humanity, especially intelligent technology, is hardly new and really did not need to be reiterated. Worse still, this films somewhat clinical treatment of the relationship between a man made sentient being and its human counterparts tends to detract from the humanity of the story. The overall effect then is to lessen the psychological impact of this rather predictable tale, as it unfolds. In summary Ex Machina is 'definitely' worth your time, just don't expect the emotional connection to be found in films like Blade Runner and others similar titles in this sci fi sub genre.

","'1917' is in essence not about war but finding what is human.Its the simple moving moments of gently rendered humanity, that define this film. It is an anti war film but not one that's overtly lecturing. Instead like 'Come and See' it shows you what war does to ordinary people and lets you reach your own conclusions.In most other respects this is an uncomplicated film, with a simple story reminiscent of 'Gallipoli' from the 1980's but painted in more subdued and reverential hues, akin to the the more recent offering, 'Dunkirk'.Perhaps my only criticism, is its a little too generous to the historically callous and often incompetent senior British officer class, who squandered lives needlessly on a daily basis.That said, this remains a masterful work, that joins other great anti war films cast in a similar vein.9/10 from me.",9,1,3,12 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Hopefully the last Star Wars movie.....
","Having seen The Last Jedi I can fully appreciate why George Lucas did not want to make any more films in the Star Wars universe. The latest offering is yet more weak tea. A rehash of the original films with weaker lead characters. Most notably Kylo Wren who, whilst villainous, is far from intimidating, let alone threatening. Even though every attempt is made in this film to shore up his shortcomings with plot contradictions and more. In short, Wren remains a pale, wimpy, whiny imitation of Darth Vader. Equally Rey is a less than inspiring Luke Skywalker knock off. She seems to be in a state of constant anxiety and confusion, not helped by a hermit-like Luke Skywalker. Like the rest of us, it feels like he would rather be somewhere else. Who can blame him.All in all this film is a real dud that goes nowhere story wise. No surprise really, as this is a once wonderful franchise that's had its day and should have been left lovingly on the shelf for future generations to take down and enjoy. Instead its been rehashed endlessly with little left to offer. Four out of ten from me.",4,15,22,20 February 2018
Silence," Read from the Silence what you will......
","Silence is one of those films where what you take away from it depends on where you start from. My starting perspective is one of pragmatism and historical fact. The realities of the time saw Portugal as a world power. Much as the US is today. Its ambitions somewhat mirror those of their latter day counterparts too. Establish a strong presence in Japan with a view to exploit it for its resources. One of the key tools in that conversion was cultural assimilation. Get the locals to see things you way. One of the key tools to achieve this at the time, was religion. Religion infused every aspect of 17th century life. It offered solace in a world filled with hardship. It was used by states to keep the populace under control and compliant and that needs to be kept in mind when considering Silence. On the surface it would seem the Jesuit priests and their followers are victims of a cruelly enforced code of silence. To believe something and not be able to express it openly.This is no doubt true. Yet, whats just as true, is Christianity, at the time was just as intolerant and inflexible and used much the same methods, including torture and executions, to ensure its religion remained in control. This benefited both the state and the clergy.So what to make of Silence? Viewed as an historical document its fine. Its beautifully crafted, with stunning visuals and a great story. I would say its a little overstated at times and it would have been nice to for the film to focus a little more of its screen time on the apostate priests lives working as a religious 'customs service' for the Japanese state. Sadly, this is compressed into the final quarter of the film. Being critical I would say it could have been more balanced and at least acknowledged more directly the brutality of religion as a political too on both sides of the East/West divide.That said, this remains an excellent film. Its well directed, acted and examines a fascinating period in human history where religion was the mainstay, that held the fabric of society together. Eight out of ten from me.",8,0,2,3 February 2017
Logan," Nihilistic, violent and depressing.....
","Three words come to mind when reviewing Logan; nihilistic, violent and depressing. There's really not a lot to like here. This is a film about a nihilistic lead character and the ugly violent events, that seem to envelop his life like a dark, perpetual gloom. Indeed, what most defines this film is endless, bloody violence. So much so that the simple story of redemption that's supposed to lift the viewer up is obscured and for the most part, silenced. What you are left with, is a rather depressing film, that, sucked dry of any real sense of hope, staggers towards its inevitable demise. Four out of ten from me.",4,10,24,10 April 2017
Snowden," A real hero....
","So often, in cinema, we are presented with people who are not, in fact, hero's but instead, little more than marketing ploys for a cause. Not so with Edward Snowden. Snowden the movie, by Oliver Stone, shows us an example of a 'real' hero. I man who has everything, a promising career, a loving girlfriend and a life in paradise. A man who casts much of his this life aside, for his principles. In this case to show the world the Orwellian surveillance state, that is growing, like a cancer, not only within the USA but also beyond its boarders.Like many of Oliver Stones films, this one is beautifully crafted. Its inherently interesting material to start with certainly but its the deft screenplay, by Stone and Kieran Fitzgerald that really brings this film to life. Joseph Gorden Levitt, an actor, I have to confess I have paid little attention to, hands in a superlative performance as Edward Snowden. Indeed, all of the cast are to be commended. So without belabouring the point, this is an excellent film.Its truthful and frank and Oliver Stone is to be roundly commended for making it. Ten out of ten from me.",10,3,9,26 November 2016
Sicario," Moral ambivalence doesn't cut the mustard.....
","Sicario is yet another one of those supposedly morally ambivalent films churned out by the US, that try's and fails to stave off international criticism. For me this film, like so many others in the same vein simply doesn't cut the mustard. Interference in other countries politics, economics and justice systems is imperialism, pure and simple. Trying to justify the crapulence of the US's various arms of government, in this case, interceding in Mexico by using the argument its necessary, irrespective of whether or not its morally justified, is simply bullshit, pure and simple. Yes, apparently, if you are a sheep, you should step aside and let the wolves do their job. That would seem to be the message to take away from this film. Of course, the problem with all of this, as this film can't help but demonstrate, is that if you behave like wolves, so will those you loose them upon. Its peace and reason that changes people for the better, not mutual brutality and violence.So setting aside my dismay at the questionable tone of this film, what did think of the film itself? Its inherently interesting material, so it is watchable. The acting is of a generally good standard. The lack of morality shown in this film however, for me, simply made it look a lot like propaganda for a cause that has already failed and rightly so.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Utterly silly, utterly off beat, hippie, sci fi mash up that works.....
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 works in spite or maybe that's because of itself. This is an utterly silly, off beat, kinda hippie, psychedelic sci fi, mash up. And guess what, that's no bad thing! I had a completely engrossing and enjoyable time watching this visually clever flick that creates what can best be described as 'action mosaics', blended with weird 60's comic book throw back sci fi elements.There's a 'contained madness' and 'layered chaos' to be found in these films with wonderful, funny, over the top characterizations you can't help but like. And at times, sympathize with. Chris Pratt and Kurt Russell, for me, really steal the show. That said, this in no way detracts from the solid performances handed in by other cast members. If you have not seen the latest addition to the zany Guardians franchise, take a look. If you like your sci fi outlandish and over the top, I think you'll love it.

It Chapter Two," Enjoyed the first chapter film much more.....
","The decision to remake the original IT film as a two part proposition offers I would imagine commercial benefits. Of course, it could also provide the opportunity to deliver a longer, more comprehensive experience, in keeping with the rather long book 'IT' both films are based upon.Regrettably, that's not been my experience. Where the first film firmly had its feet on the ground and did an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere and sense of nostalgia of the book, the second chapter fumbles, awkwardly .Its chief shortcomings is it incessant need to use flash backs to make its point. As if its only by referring back to the first chapter that it can make sense of what follows. It lacks cohesion too and a well defined sense of direction, moving around listlessly and disjointedly.Suffice to say, after a wonderful first chapter film this follow up is a real disappointment.5/10 from me.",5,2,3,10 October 2019
12 Strong," Every American war film is like every American war film.....
","Every American war film, in my experience, is like every other American war film. 
Its the same basic premise, with much the same context and underlying attitude. That is an exaggerated belief in the 'righteousness' of the cause, married up to conceited obnoxious key characters who have a sense of ownership and entitlement, that puts them at odds with pretty much everyone they meet. 12 Strong is no exception. The main characters are loud, rude and generally really, really unlikable. Its hard to empathise with them or feel any genuine interest in them, especially given the historical context used yet again to justify their presence in Afghanistan. 9/11 was a led by Saudi nationals not Afghans but because the US is inextricably tied to Saudi through the petro dollar the poor Afghans drew the short straw. Of course this is never mentioned.Instead our 'hero's' go about their heroic business in formulaic style.The action scenes are predictable but well done but really there's little more on offer here. Of course, given there never seems to be any departure from the general script, that's to be expected. Take a look but don't expect anything you have not seen before. 5/10 from me.",5,0,6,5 April 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Decent action flick....
","I came to this film not expecting a great deal. I was then surprised to find a decent action flick with a subtle anti war, pro environment message.....First off this is above all else, an action flick. The fun starts from the get go and continues at a good pace throughout this film. Unlike previous Kong films, this time its humanity intruding on Kong's patch not Kong being transported back to civilization. Personally, I think this approach works far better. It allows for a world of CGI generated, larger than life creatures, like Kong to be brought to life, creating an outlandish but fun jungle style adventure.Whats also appealing is the pro environment, anti war message. Without giving too much away, the warmongers in this film really don't fare too well. Mess with nature and pay the price. Something we should all keep in mind. The acting is for the most excellent helped by well rounded, colourful characterizations, that, whilst not too realistic, fit snugly into the rather fantastical world of Skull Island.In sort, I really enjoyed Kong Skull Island and I think you will too.

The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A film that should probably not have been made
","I may be alone in my belief that the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogy should not have been made into films. The message lying at the heart of the books, reflects, for me, a deep sadness and reluctance in the face of war. Tolkien was appalled by Stalinist Communism and Hitlarian Nazism, in equal measure. He was also appalled by the indiscriminate bombing by the allies that took place during WW2. Tolkien was in many ways a moderate who had first hand experience of and an abhorrence for the horrors war inflicts on ordinary people.Regrettably but perhaps, predictably, the anti war sentiment at the heart of Tolkiens works is largely lost in the films. What we get instead amounts to visually pretty, action films. There is lots of exposition but little character development.This is in spite of an excellent cast of top shelf actors. The Battle of the Five Armies continues this trend offering large helpings of action, clever special effects and bloodshed but little else. The net result is you are left feeling rather empty. Yet another technically competent, commercially driven but ultimately soulless outing. Six out of ten from me.",Null,3,8,22 March 2015
Murder on the Orient Express," Decent remake of a classic...
",Murder on the Orient Express is a decent remake of a classic. The positives include a veteran cast and a solid script. Kenneth Branagh's Hercule Poirot is always going to attract the inevitable comparison with David Suchet's performance. Certainly the latest Poirot incarnation has a somewhat different vibe heavily emphasising the characters obsessive compulsive disorder. A little too much in my opinion but this is a minor point.The feel of this film captures the essence of Christie's thriller but shifts the story's emphasis in a way that wont appeal to all. Previous incarnations of this story have tended to focus on the 'who dunnit' aspect slowly unravelling a predictably complex story of murder. This film flattens and compacts the sleuthing to emphasise the emotional trauma and loss that in some respects is really at the heart of this story. In that sense this film is hugely successful . I have not seen a version of this tale that made as strong an emotional connection with me. Ultimately whether you prefer this film or older editions is really going to depend on your expectations. If you are a classic crime buff this interpretation may annoy and frustrate you. If on the other hand you can enjoy a tale based simply on its own merits you may come to appreciate this remake for what it is. Eight out of ten from me.,Null,0,2,29 January 2018
Wonder Woman," A re-envisioning that works.....
","I'm old enough to remember the original Wonder Woman TV series. As a kid I got a kick out Linda Carter's lasso twirling, 70's fem super hero. Carter fitted the role beautifully and I have to admit skepticism, when I heard yet another remake, of sorts, was on the way, in the form of a Wonder Woman film. I was surprised therefore, at how immediately comfortable I felt watching the latest film. Gal Gadot is a perfect choice for the role of Wonder Woman. Her looks, athleticism and the somewhat exotic accent fit well into this franchise. Better still, the story line, whilst a bit contrived, works well enough to make this a mostly enjoyable, action packed romp. Perhaps the only downside being, what I felt, was a somewhat subdued and uninteresting performance by Chris Pine. I don't mind Pine but somehow I felt he was more fizzle than burn this outing. Look forward to seeing more of him in the Star Trek franchise where he really shines. Casting this small consideration aside, there's a fair bit to like here. Don't over think it or expect anything by way of a revelation, it is comic book super hero land after all. If you are sensible enough to sit back and simply enjoy this fun action flick for what it is, you wont be disappointed. Seven out of ten from me.",7,5,14,14 July 2017
Marriage Story," Wooden Kramer vs Kramer knock off.....
","Kramer vs Kramer set the standard way back in 1979 for divorce films. It exposed the underbelly of contemporary society in the US, where a shift in individual and parental expectations, supplanted traditional family values.Simply titled 'Marriage Story' treads an all too familiar path which is no crime in itself. Where it falls down, is in its contrived approach. This is most obvious in the awkward performances, that I would mostly describe, as heavily scripted and wooden.Worse still, in my opinion it depicts contemporary US males in a less than flattering light as inconstant,incompetent and weak. I feel its a deeply unfair representation that fails to acknowledge the contribution and pressures placed on men, in modern society.I'll confess to not finishing this one. I found it irritating on a personal level and flawed, in most other respects.4/10.",4,3,9,17 December 2019
Fifty Shades of Grey," Mills and Boon does Hollywood
","Minor spoilers.I'll confess I did not watch all of this. I'll no doubt raise the ire of the feminists by saying this but what I did see, is 100% proof, 'chick flick'. Long story short ordinary, rather uninteresting girl is swept up by absurdly handsome rich guy. Its every pimply, binge dieting office secretary's daydream come true. And to make the whole thing even spicier, rich guy is a bit kinky. 'Ooooh, how delicious'. I can see why the book sold well. Its extra naughty Mills and Boon. As a film however its an absurdity. The acting is fine, the story line, by contrast, is just plain silly. I won't go into too much detail, there's no point. Suffice to say there's lots of 'naughty' expectation and a bit of whipping to churchy sounding music. Better still, frumpy girl takes revenge on the part of every overlooked, resentful spinster, by giving handsome, rich guy, the bums rush in the end. That'll teach him.

Black Panther," Action man meets the Lion King.....
","I'm really not a big fan of Marvels cartoonie flicks, so call me biased. That said, that bias had to come from somewhere and for me, its the general inanity and blandness of these kinds of films that is so off putting. Black Panther feels a lot like Action Man meets The Lion King. Its got a kind of unreal, simplistic , garishly optimistic feel to it, that is, I suspect, simply unconvincing for anyone over 14 years of age. The story is the usual basic adventure/action fare that's fraught with contradiction. Why an advanced society would embrace a medieval feudalistic model of rule based on a King makes little sense. Nor does the notion of it being hidden from the world behind a rather contrived force field. I'm sure none of the not so lucky locals, forced to live in simple huts, would be tempted to tell the world for some extra $$?The narrative is predictable. Comprised of shallow, basic dialogue and bland humour, designed to make the character's seem mildly believable.Really the action is the only place where this film shines. That, of course, is to be expected but is there any harm in injecting a little intelligence into the overall story rather than dumbing the thing down to the point where it could only really appeal to early teens?So whats left to say? Watchable on a very superficial level but really that is it. More one for the young than cynical worldly wise, old guys, like myself. 5/10 from me.",5,2,5,28 May 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman vs Superman....Dawn of Tedium
","Its amazing how much money can be shelled out to make a boring action movie. Batman vs Superman reasserts this notion, in mind numbing style.Whats really absent from this action movie is action. Instead, you get a lot of half baked introspection and hackneyed,undergraduate philosophy about the injustices of the world. The actual action, such as it is, is squeezed into the latter half of the movie, much like Ben Affleck's Batman in his ridiculous, mechanical super hero suit. Even then, what we get is uninspiring action sequences that fizzle out before they ever get off the ground. Simply put, there's not a lot to like here. My advice, give this one a pass. Three out of ten from me.",3,8,18,4 April 2016
Jojo Rabbit," Clever comedic satire......
","There's no denying Jojo Rabbit is a clever piece of cinema. It takes the hysteria surrounding Nazism in Germany in WWII and subverts it, by focusing its idiocy through a lens of everyday, 'normalcy'.Hatred of Jews with absurd caricatures and rumours. Beatles like hysteria over the Fuhrer, who is idolised by the main character to the point of becoming an imaginary friend. The bizarre rituals and militarised games played by Hitler Youth are all brought into focus. Its nutty stuff and skewed from this angle, often quite funny, as insightful satire should be.That's not to say this is entirely new. Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator did it first and in a general sense, did it better. Indeed, this film does have its shortcomings. Chief of which, is its retrospective moral outrage, over the treatment of the Jews. As my mother, who lived through WWII noted years ago, 'everyone was sorry after the fact but not sorry enough at the time, to do anything meaningful about it'.Suffice to say, it would have been better, I feel, to look more into the character of the young Jewish girl hiding in the families home, presenting her as a human being first and foremost. This would have said more, than moral angst ever could.A little disappointed too to see yet more anti Russian sentiment. The Russians did not typically execute prisoners, only those found guilty of war crimes. Many did die in captivity but that happened in US and Soviet custody.That said, what this film does demonstrate in a innocently funny but also very sad way, is how Nazism effected children. Something that is often overlooked, when visiting this period of history.Suffice to say there's a lot to like here. This films funny, sad, likeable, down to earth, and a bit zany. For me a must watch.8/10.",8,1,2,30 December 2019
Midway," A more mature remake of a classic....
","I remember as a young boy being accompanied by my father to see the original Midway. It was a polished film but even back then, the suffering and death, shocked me on a certain level.The new film does a decent job of recapturing the original but also balances the historical books, by acknowledging the suffering and courage on the part of combatants, on both sides and the price paid by Chinese who helped US servicemen downed in Japanese occupied China.It shows a maturity of story telling, rarely seen in my experience of Hollywood these days. It;s refreshingly free of politically correct posturing or revisionist history, which was nice to see too. Its a simple, tragic story, of young lives lost defending their homelands and their respective ideals.The combat scenes are well shot if a little hard to take seriously on occasion. Still it IS Hollywood, so some dramatic license is to be expected. Acting is surprisingly polished with some casting choices I would not have picked, that worked remarkably well.7/10 from me.",7,1,2,9 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," In many respects recalls the original Star Wars film.....
","The latest addition to the Star Wars stable of films, The Force Awakens, recalls the first film made way back in 1977. There's a hero who is unaware of her Jedi powers, a new, bigger Death Star and and a villain who shares the same lineage as Darth Vader and wants to be like him. This film is not really doing anything, in other words, that has not already been done. Moreover, the original achieved what it did with more class and flair. The villain in this film lacks the presence and menace, of Darth Vader. The hero comes across as a rather desperate re-run of Luke Skywalker, whilst, 'super sizing' a Death Star doesn't change the fact its still, well, a Death Star. Reintroducing some classic Star Wars actors and characters, aside from the obvious nostalgia factor, does little to lift this film either. The result is a rather ordinary flick, that is not bad, as such, but for those of us old enough to remember the original film, its not doing anything new either. Instead, The Force Awakens, looks more like a retread of a much better, earlier, envisioning from the Star Wars universe. Six out of ten from me.",6,5,11,8 May 2016
Unbroken," Falls short of the mark...
","The story of the remarkable life of Louis Zamperini as treated in Helen Hillenbrand's book Unbroken has been adapted to the screen in this film which shares the same name. Lamentably whilst this film has many of the trapping of expensive Hollywood productions, it lacks the most vital ingredient, a soul. We get to know very little about the Louis Zamperini, the man. Instead, what we are offered is a larger than life caricature, that focuses on Zamperini's Olympic achievements and his courage when faced with abuse at the hands of the Japanese as a prisoner of war. What also irritated me about this production, was the attempt to humanize and by extension reform Zamperini's abuser, Mutsuhiro Watanabe. A man occupying US authorities, not unreasonably, classified a war criminal. This film does not show the true extent of Watanabe's abuses (which perhaps is not surprising) but nonetheless showing him in a photo as a boy with his father in no way detracts from or excuses what he did to defenseless, weakened men. All in all, for me, this film falls short of the mark. Its not dreadful but it would have benefited greatly from taking more time to let us get to know the not just Zamperini but the other men who served alongside him.

Life," Attack of the Martian Octopus......
","This film could just have easily been called Attack of the Martian Octopus.Sorry if that initial description sounds depreciating but there's really not a lot to this film. Its a fundamentally simple premise that, in a basic way, is akin to the likes of Alien, just not as exciting.The acting is reasonable but this is not a film run by narrative, for the most part. Its an exposition driven affair, that is action focused. To be fair too, there's a good amount of action but the nature of the film is restricted by the narrow confines of the space station, in which it takes place.I'd say not a bad film as such but not doing anything terribly innovative . A few more risks and maybe a more expansive setting, would have added some depth. Six out of ten from me.",6,6,15,31 March 2017
Deadpool," Good potential let down by questionable scripting...
","There's a lot to like about Deadpool. It has a good cast, humour and action. What is lacks, is a good script.Ryan Reynolds is perfectly cast as Deadpool. Comedy is where Reynold's shines and this film is as much a showpiece for his off the wall, politically incorrect and often ribald comedic talents, as much as it is an action film. The jokes can be crude but they are well timed and often, rather clever. The action scenes are not half bad either.They also mix in gallows humour that works well in the context of this film. Where Deadpool suffers, is in the scripting/storytelling department. The incessant oscillation between past and present, disrupts the natural flow established early in the film. The result is an annoying experience, where you start to buy into the storyline only to have it broken again and again by uncomfortable segues into Deadpools past. Worse still, the background scenes presented are often emotionally sugary, drawn out and frankly, at times, rather boring. This film, would have been much better served by getting the background out of the way, up front and in a more abbreviated fashion. The Deadpool franchise shows promise. It would be nice to see a second film that's more focused on Reynolds humour and the jokery action scenes, as these elements really define the Deadpool, anti-hero character. I rate the first Deadpool cinematic outing a six out of ten and mostly, for Reynolds chuckle worthy performance.",6,4,15,11 March 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Dubious 007 pot boiler....
","The Kingsman is a rather dubious proposition for so many reasons. The key character, a young working class lad, is taken under the wing of a super secretive organisation that has a knights of the round table meets 007 thing going on. In spite of unconvincing protests to the contrary, the only way the working class lad can make good is by aping his upper crust 'betters'. Transformed from a working class nobody surrounded by dodgy, listless criminal types, into a Savile row suited snob with a weaponized umbrella. Oh and to prove your upper crust, psychopathic character, apparently thinking you are killing a beloved pet is the way to go ('ugh'). Its ugly, judgmental stuff and the nastiness doesn't end there.Environmentalists also take a jolly good thrashing, as does any bounder who thinks the anachronistic, Royal establishment, is a worn out symbol of inequality, that's had its day. If you don't delve too deeply Kingsman is moderately entertaining, 007 knock off. If, on the other hand, like me, you can't help but take a closer look, this flick is actually a pretty nasty, negative piece of work, that reinforces toxic social and political norms.

John Wick: Chapter 2," Light Wick and stand back.....
","John Wick Chapter two is an explosion of violence. Case of light Wick and stand back. Everything is a weapon, cars, guns, hand to hand, knives and even pencils. This movies flows well, along with an endless stream of blood. Its a well worn formula that really should not work but for some reason, it does. I think the key reason it does work is its variety, polish and Keanu Reeves. Reeves is clearly not a martial artist (although it appears some time has been invested in giving him some general Ju Jitsu style training). This lack of martial expertise is compensated for by cleverly using everything as a weapon in quick succession. Reeves also suits this kind of dead eyed killer role well. Who would have thought Ted from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure would travel so well in the action genre. This is implausible stuff but its done so well this hardly matters.

Annihilation," What am I?
","You know something is very wrong when your first reaction is 'what am I?' Annihilation is just like the game where you try to guess what the other person is but in this case there is simply no working it out. 'Am I a sci fi, am I a horror, am I a personal introspective?' 'Well, maybe.'This film could have fulfilled any of those themes had it not run out of cinematic space before it could happen. The result is a deeply felt sense of pervading incompleteness, not helped by a mildly clever but predictably anti climatic, ending. 5/10 from me.",5,1,4,3 April 2018
Spectre," James Bland.....
","Spectre is the latest in the James Bond series of films and its well named. This film is a ghostly shadow of films that have gone before it. It tries all too hard to recapture the essence of older films with set pieces using furniture, locations, clothing, weapons and vehicles that recall the 60's Bond era. The key problem is there is little on offer in the way of original storytelling. Indeed, the story that is offered up looks more like its been modeled to accommodate the chic Bond 60's revival feel of the film. The result is a disjointed proposition that ambles from dispirit location to location with very little to bind the whole thing together. The action is of the typical over the top Bond variety but somehow the villains feel a little dull and lifeless. Again rather than being original they feel like quickly assembled caricatures from past films. Worse still some of the action makes little sense. If you pay attention you will see things blow up for no obvious reason and hand guns, in particular, seem to have developed a range, accuracy and power no hand gun ever had. Suspension of disbelief is simply taken a little too far. Perhaps the last thing that really kills of this film is the noticeable absence of classic bond presence. Daniel Craig's Bond is, for the most part, a rather dead pan character who lacks the classic Bond rascally wit and charm. The end result of all of this is a film that's no terribly engaging or especially exciting. It simply lacks the style, humour and charisma of past Bond outings.

Mad Max: Fury Road," Petrol heads meet heavy metal....
","Mad Max Fury Road takes elements you might expect to find in any rock concert that utilities lots of heavy metal props and tricks and marries it up to a hard core, petrol head driven world of ordered, mechanized, post apocalyptic chaos.This is a highly visual film. There is an economy of dialogue. Instead, the actions of the key protagonists tell the story that needs to be told. As such, its hard to offer up much insight into the quality of acting, as there is not really a lot of acting, as such, on offer. That said, this films works well because it adheres to its action formula. Its exciting and the pace builds and builds right through to the closing scenes. Perhaps the only downside is the rather anti climatic confrontation with the films key villain.In summary this is an quality film. Its entertaining throughout and never dull.

Hacksaw Ridge," A war film smothered between thick coatings of religious rhetoric....
","I came to Hacksaw Ridge hoping for an interesting and realistic portrayal of the life of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector, who saved the lives of countless battlefield wounded, as a medic.What you get instead is saccharine, hero stick, smothered beneath thick coatings of religious rhetoric. Its painful stuff, that had me squirming in my seat within the first five minutes of the film's opening scenes. Just as bothersome is the assumption its 'OK' to be a behave like a nihilistic, cruel drunk (the father character) because 'hey, he served in the war'. This is such a common excuse, in US made war films and television that really does not hold up to close scrutiny.The war scenes in this film are well shot (it does come with a huge budget) and the acting is of a good caliber. That said, there's little of substance on offer here, aside from romanticizing brutal and awful events, that, in my mind, deserve a more somber, down to earth treatment.

13 Hours," This is not America....
","One thing needs to be kept in mind when watching any war film that portrays the US's military misfortunes in recent years; this is 'not' America. The cold hard facts are the US administration and its allies invaded Libya and overthrew its government. This triggered a factional war between rivals groups vying for power. No one officially asked the US government and its European pals to do what they did and their reasons for doing so, are, to say the least, questionable. The film itself is well directed, the action scenes capably executed and the material is inherently interesting. That said, this film is also very one sided. It fails to acknowledge any culpability on the part of the US government, for the misery and chaos, their role, in what I would describe as adventurism, has caused the Libyan people. So whilst I felt a degree of sympathy for the those on the ground, the realty is, this is yet another place in the world where the US simply should not be.

Alien: Covenant," Marred by incomplete conceptualizations and themes....
","Alien Covenant is marred by incomplete conceptualizations and themes. Like Prometheus, this film fails to gel the concepts found in the early Aliens films. The result is a film that offers up incomplete, dis-articulated themes. You have segues into the world of the creators, the aliens but like the hasty back story that tries to explain the whole proposition, its all too brief and sketchy to amount to anything, as a whole. For viewers like myself, looking for some semblance of an epiphany of sorts, the result is deflation and frustration in equal measure. Is there an upside? The acting is good and the special effects are decent. Scott does know how to create a very believable futuristic setting but sadly whilst the table is well set, the plates are empty. All in all, yet another film in the Aliens trilogy that's wholly unremarkable and given it offers nothing of substance, instantly forgettable. Five out of ten from me.",5,1,8,28 May 2017
The Martian," Lets feel good about NASA......
","Poor old NASA, no ones heard a whole lot from them lately. Indeed, it seems the Chinese are getting more attention. Not to worry, The Martian, offers up a few spoonfuls of feel good, cinematic hope, for forlorn US astro-nuts out there. The film presents a very optimistic view of a high tech, future NASA. A NASA populated by super science types, like Matt Daemons character, who can solve all problems and overcome any situation. Even being stranded, Robinson Crusoe style, on planet Mars. This film is over the top but, for all that, quite entertaining. Daemon is his pleasant, laid back, jokery, folksy self, fitting like a homemade spacesuit into this role. What is surprising, is how the writers and director, Ridley Scott, managed to make, what is on the surface, a not so exciting premise, a guy stranded on a barren planet, quite engaging and enjoyable. On that basis, this film is to be commended. That said, this film has, in my opinion, been chronically over hyped, especially in the pre-release marketing and as such, has created an expectation, I feel, it could never really live up to. The Martian is a good film. Its well cast, employs engaging and amusing narrative and surprisingly, given what appears initially, to be, bland material, its never boring. Just keep in mind, its not the super, fantastic, life changing, inspiring, proposition its sold as, either. Seven out of ten from me.",7,2,4,29 March 2016
