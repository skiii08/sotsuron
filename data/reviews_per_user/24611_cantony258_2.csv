The King's Speech," The next Shawshank Redemption?
","I've said this before and I'll say it again. The best stories in life (and film) have simple plots and complicated, inspiring and intriguing characters.The plot of the King's Speech is simple. When King Edward VIII of England abdicates his throne for hedonistic reasons, his younger brother, George VI is forced to step into the monarchy and responsibly lead the kingdom through a war brought on them by an unmoralistic and aggressive Hitler. That's it. Simple.What makes the story remarkable is the development and building of the characters and their relationships.The story gives us a touching look into the struggles faced by George VI ('Bertie') as he works with his crushing stutter. As an adult, he and his wife, Elizabeth, go from therapist to therapist in the quest to bandage the problem, but to no avail. After all hope is lost, Elizabeth seeks out an Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue, known for his unorthodox methods. The therapy with Lionel had a shaky start, but eventually Bertie and Lionel developed a trusting relationship, with sessions filled with humor and pathos. Bertie can't remember a time he didn't stutter. Logue insists from the beginning of the therapy that no infant is born with a stammer, it is developed as a child. Gradually, Bertie reveals that underneath the adult speech impediment lies an inferiority complex from suppressed childhood memories of a larger-than-life brother, perpetual negative reinforcement from a dominant father and a cold, unaffectionate mother. Over time, the therapist-patient relationship develops into an unlikely friendship of two men from extremely different worlds.In the background to this relationship is the abdication crisis. The relationship between Edward and Bertie is most fruitful. Here is a clash between hedonism and responsibility, fulfilling your quest for happiness versus overcoming your fears so that you meet your responsibilities. You can't help but be amazed at the courage of both men. That's right. Both men. While Edward can be seen as being a hedonistic fool, he can also be seen as a courageous man giving up crown for love. Talk about a different point of view! Bertie's bravery is the core of the story. It exemplifies Shakespeare's famous quote from Twelfth Night, 'Be not afraid of greatness: some men are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.' Bertie has greatness thrust upon him. He overcomes his fears and his weaknesses and leads the nation through a war with inspiring speeches.And behind every great man is a great woman. Throughout the journey, Elizabeth was always supportive, giving him time and space to be the man he is and gently nudging Bertie when he needed it. As her own woman, she carries herself gracefully, respects all people, and stands up for herself and her husband as needed.What makes this remarkable story into a movie masterpiece is the casting, direction, writing... and most of all the performance and delivery. Everything about this movie is perfect. The casting all around was on point. And the actors casted gave a phenomenal performance. If Colin Firth does not get the Academy Award for this performance, I will lose all respect for the award. He nailed the crushing stammer. That, in and of itself, was masterful. But to also fully develop the character with kindness, courage, and vulnerabilities is pure magnificence! Geoffrey Rush gave Lionel Logue spunk and life, but not too much to overwhelm the relationship with Colin Firth. The chemistry between the Firth and Rush was terrific, with Lionel Logue amusingly bouncing his eccentricities off an often-flustered King George. Helena Bonham-Carter's was understated and graceful with the good balance of gumption. Guy Pearce is excellent as the womanizing Edward VII.This movie moved at a good pace from the opening minutes to the very end. In the journey, you laugh, you cry, you find yourself holding your breath. And you're treated to masterful acting. What's not to love about this movie? The Kings Speech in the same realm of The Shawshank Redemption. Can it be compared to The Godfather? This jury is still out on that conviction.",10,1,3,24 February 2011
The Fighter," How many boxing movies do we need? Apparently, never enough!
","How many boxing movies do we need? Apparently, never enough! And is every boxing movie an Oscar contender? It seems so. Some have compared The Fighter to Rocky and Cinderella Man. Boxing and the underdog overcoming obstacles would be the two themes that run common between the three movies. I've also heard it's similar to Raging Bull, but I can't say anything on that as I haven't seen the particular film.The Fighter has a simple plot. Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) wants a boxing title.Micky Ward always stood in the shadows of his older brother Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale). Dickie was once a title contender, who's moment of fame was knocking out Sugar Ray Leonard, but has since become a crack-addict. Though 15 years have passed since that knock-out, Dickie lives daily in that story's repetition and the dream of having a come-back. A camera crew is following Dickie to chronicle the effects of cocaine, but Dickie and his family believes the documentary is about his comeback. Dickie played such a strong role, I didn't realize Micky was the main character of the movie for the first hour or so! Between Dickie and their Mom (Melissa Leo), Micky was submissively suffocating in the shadows, all the while allowing himself to be used in the selfish gains of his Mom and brother. With the help of his girlfriend, Charlene (Amy Adams), Micky develops some backbone and finds clarity to his life. He pulls himself away from his overwhelming, tight-knit and crazy family and starts training. Getting to that point of growing a backbone and standing up for himself was quite the internal struggle for Micky, which the movie does a very good job of depicting.Behind every great man is a great woman. The mother is a great woman gone bad. You know that she means well. She really loves her family and wants to keep the family together. The desire of seeing her boys rise to fame started as selfless devotion but turned into selfish self-fulfillment. It blinds her from truth and reality. She turns a blind eye to Dickie's drug addiction and failures and refuses to face the truth that a real manager could provide better opportunity for Micky. But her character brings the meat to the movie - the story of family, commitment and tenacity. Charlene, on the other hand, is a great woman. She really supports Micky and wants what is good for him. At one point, she started going down that path of ruin that the mother started on at some point, but with the help of Dickie (suprise!), she comes back to her senses.Marl Wahlberg gave an acceptable performance. Perhaps it would seem more impressive if Christian Bale hadn't dominated the screen. He completely owned his character. I'm not a fan of him as a person, but I can't help but be amazed by his passion and skill for acting. He dropped a lot of weight to the point that he looks morosely ill with thin balding hair and brown teeth. The way he talked, walked, ran, interacted... I had to keep reminding myself that this was Christian Bale I was watching, much like how I keep reminding myself that I'm watching Marlon Brando in the Godfather. Yes, that's right. I'm comparing Bale's performance to Brando. Only in this instance, though. You realize fully what a superb job Bale did when you see the real Dickie during the closing credits. Bale is my horse for that Oscar race. Amy Adams did a very believable performance. She was gumption and grit with a good dose of sexy.I was impressed with the direction of this film. Every scene had such life, grit and realism to it. Very commendable, to say the least. The cackle of sisters and family life brought a good touch of humor to the otherwise serious movie.While The Fighter is generally categorized as a boxing movie, there's so much more to it than the sport. It portrayed the life of a working-class/poor family's struggles; the good, the bad and the ugly of a tight knit family; and how far tenacious determination can really take you.",8,2,4,24 February 2011
