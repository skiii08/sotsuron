"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," a must-be-seen for all gay icons lovers'
","The plot isn't so exciting, but the actors are really 3 stars! Surrounded by a beautiful soundtrack, wonderful dresses and a lot of typical 'trans' humor, the movie has to be seen and to be 'experienced' as a greatest hits for all the gay icons, from Abba to Village People... I saw it in Italian and in English, but I must say that the translated version doesn't differ much in quality from the original one. The jokes are as much as amusing and the voices of the characters are really suitable!",9,1,2,25 April 2000
