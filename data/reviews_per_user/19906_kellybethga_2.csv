Black Swan," Let's Put It Plainly - This was HORRIBLE
","At least I watched this on HBO for free; I'd be highly upset if I paid money for movie tickets. I love Natalie Portman and think she's a fine actress. However, it was like there was a competition for 'artsy film of the year that wins critics' reviews' vs. an actual interesting film, and artsy won. The darkness was too well hidden and just didn't make sense, IMHO. It was also a little shocking to see how skinny Ms. Portman got to portray this role - you may not want to let your impressionable daughters watch this. Ribs, spines, pelvic and collar bones are prominent. Realistic to the industry, I know, but not something I want my daughter exposed to if I can help it.",1,5,10,18 January 2012

",This was so highly reviewed I thought I had a winner for sure. Paid rental fee to xfinity without pause. And then I was very disappointed. I love Toni Collette and she was the one carrying the whole movie. It wasn't scary....just WEIRD.,4,1,3,6 October 2018
