Hereditary," Wow, really bad
","I am very affected by horror movies and cannot see them in theaters because they bother me for weeks after. I have to watch on small screen. But, this was possibly the WORST horror movie I've ever seen. Simply awful. I was laughing at each of the 'horror' moments and thinking this just couldn't get worse, but it did. The premise is not well explained and so you come away thinking what the hell was this? As in no purpose nor relevance. It got such raves from critics but I am now sure those people were paid shills because this was completely stupid and NOT scary, visially or mentally.",1,1,5,10 October 2018
The Irishman," Oh hey, ANOTHER gangster movie
","Just when I thought we'd be through with these never-ending Deniro, Scorsese, Pacino, Pesci mob movies, we get one more.It feels like another one of these annual, stupid Diane Keaton attempts to make a movie.Y'all are too old, too trapped in your stale characters, and no longer interesting to watch.
It isn't cute.Deniro plays his only character he's always played, which is tired and worse now that he's so darn old and feeble. Pesci is the same charter as any movie he's done. Pacino as well but he is the most believable via CGI.This 'story' has been filmed about 50 times.
When is it enough??!
We get it - there were a lot of shady losers in our east coast history.
Dear Hollywood and Scorsese, the rest of America is tired of these stupid NJ/NY gang movies. Find another genre and leave this one to its death, puh-lease.",2,9,15,22 December 2019
Cloud Atlas," Take a bad novel and make a bad movie
","If this is what we have to look forward to in various lives, it's a complete downer. Give up now. Apparently, any one can write a take on reincarnation/karma these days.Some items that really blew it for me: Far too much unneeded violence in this attempt to make a poorly executed point about 'being here for each other'.The composer/man whore shoots himself instead of finding his happiness with his love - when there was nothing keeping him from it but his irrational/idiotic self.The heroine spouts nonsense and that is supposed to cause people to rise up and find their true purpose/meaning/reason for being? In seeing the later generations, it didn't reach an effect.Poor revision of Soylent Green.A number of anachronisms throughout.'Intellectuals' dump on Ayn Rand, but her writings are far superior to this nonsense.There was no conclusion on whether any effort in any life is useful. That alone makes it a poor narrative.The old sage character says that Halle's character is the best thing that happened to him, ever. That completely dismisses his former love who bore him a child. Terrible continuity.Apparently, the goal of all these lives is to end up with a LA-style, beach front bungalow dressed up for a party none of your community/humanity you fought so hard for will be going to.",6,8,20,2 November 2012
