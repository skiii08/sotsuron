Casablanca," Casablanca Overview
","After going on Walt Disney World's Hollywood Studios 'The Great Movie Ride' I knew that Casablanca needed to be next on my watch list. Perhaps one of the most beloved movies of all time, Michael Cortiz's 'Casablanca' (1942) takes place during World War II in unoccupied Africa. Truly a timeless film, it has absolutely superb casting starting with Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Isla Lund. Filled with romance, personal tragedy and war, it covers anything any man or woman would want to see and stays with you for far longer than most movies. In my opinion, while it is an exceptionally well written show with dialog people are still quoting today, it is the acting that really makes it stand apart from others. It has a great story line but every single person involved with this film seems to have consumed themselves in a way that is not often found. They inhabit the role they are portraying and it just makes everything seem that much more real and that much easier to relate to!",Null,1,2,10 May 2013
Chinatown," The water from Chinatown
","Considered to be one of the greatest movies of it's era, Roman Polanski's Chinatown (1974) stars Jack Nicholson in the role of J.J. Gittes, a private investigator in Los Angeles in the 1930's. Don't get too excited though! Gittes' largest client base consists of those who believe that their significant other is cheating on the. That certainly was the case for Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) when she came stumbling into his office, sure that her husband, Hollis, is cheating on her. But as Gittes goes digging, he realizes that it's a whole lot more than that when a bunch of the city's water goes missing and Hollis turns up dead. As Gittes investigates further, he's intrigued to find that his trail leads him to Noah Cross, a businessman and Evelyn's father. Can Gittes step out of his comfort zone and solve a case that is more than just an affair? Or will he get in over his head and down in the missing water? An interesting movie with a neat plot line. A bit slow at times but good over all!",Null,0,1,10 May 2013
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane
","Opening with a scene of a dying man inside his castle-like estate peering into the winter scene of a snow globe until he drops and and you hear him utter, 'Rosebud...' Now, jumping back and forth between flashbacks and present day, reporters are trying to figure out what the last words of the late Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper baron and perhaps the richest man in the world, Orson Welles Citizen Kane (1941) is perhaps one of the most famous movies of all time. Even if you know nothing about the storyline you'll be hard pressed to find someone who hasn't at least heard of Citizen Kane. Through the series of flashbacks, the audience learns how Charles Foster Kane became the richest man in the world, and how he turned his life around after his rise to power basically made him lose himself. One of the greatest artistic works of all time, Citizen Kane is a classic that everyone should see at least once.",8,1,2,10 May 2013
The Grapes of Wrath," The Grapes of Wrath - Emotional & Historical
","Although 'The Grapes of Wrath' was released in the wake of John Steinbeck's award winning novel, and had big shoes to fill, Ford (the movie's director) accurately depicted the emotional and historic significance that Steinbeck had done the previous year. The viewers follow the Joad family as they battle the effects of The Dust Bowl and struggle with the economic hardships that plagued many families during the Great Depression. Tom Joad returns home from jail (where he spent 4 years serving a murder charge) to find his family's farm destroyed and desolate, and his family facing eviction the next day. The family begin their trek to California only to arrive in a place with a starving job market. During their time in California Tom seems to do the family more harm than good with his justice-seeking attitude that send the family to multiple new locations before Tom's final departure from the family. This film draws out the high-levels of emotion that many encounter when they reflect on this historical time in U.S. history. This film is a must see for anybody who is looking for a great plot with historical significance!",8,0,1,10 May 2013
Annie Hall," Annie Hall
","While I was watching this movie, I felt like I was living in my crazy and neurotic aunt's diary during her brief stint as an artist in New York City. BUT! That's not to say I didn't enjoy the film, in fact, I thought it was brilliant. Lately, there have been way too many 'rom-coms' that are telling the same sort of love story with different actors and actresses, and 'Annie Hall' was a nice break from the. Woody Allen, crafts a love story that creatively plays with time and stream of consciousness. The viewers hear about the relationship between Alvy Singer (played by Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (played by Diane Keaton), through Allen's mind, and direct communication with the audience. I feel as if this directness that Allen uses grounds viewers and reminds them that love is bittersweet, but doesn't have to be irrational. If you're looking for a romance movie, but you're sick of all the hokey stuff that today's movies have, 'Annie Hall' is a perfect choice!",8,0,0,10 May 2013
The Graduate," Comedy?
","The first thing I thought after watching this movie was: 'why is this a comedy?', maybe it's just me, but if I'm wondering why a movie is considered a certain genre, it's probably not a good thing. I was disappointed that I didn't pee my pants because laughter (not actually), but I was expecting a good laugh, and I didn't get it. Besides the fact that I didn't consider the movie a 'comedy', it still had a pretty good plot. Ben Braddock (played by Dustin Hoffman), the new graduate and the character that the movie's title is based off of, finds his way into a very eccentric love affair with his father's business partner's wife, Mrs. Robinson (played by Anne Bancroft), but eventually ends up falling in love with her daughter, Elaine Robinson (played by Katherine Ross). It is a very bizarre story, but ultimately, it was pretty entertaining, despite the fact I never got my good laugh!",6,0,1,10 May 2013
Singin' in the Rain," An Overview
","Gene Kelly's 'Singin' in the Rain' (1952) has incredible cinematography, especially considering how early in the color era it was made. The whole movie has a very smooth, unedited feel, with long, smooth takes, especially in the dance numbers. It's almost as though the scenes were done in one take, as you would expect for a life-stage production of a musical! The acting by Jean Hagen (Lina) and Debbie Reynolds (Kathy) are my favorite parts of the film, however. They play such contrasting characters and each made their part so their own it's really something to see. Then you throw in the famous songs, 'Singin' in the Rain', 'Moses Supposes' and 'Good Morning', this musical is just fun waiting to be watched.",10,0,2,10 May 2013
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction break down
","Made with an All-Star cast of John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Amanda Plummer, Eric Stoltz, Eric Stoltz, Maria de Medeiros and Bruce Willis, 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) is quite unlike any movie I've ever seen before. Focusing on the lives of two hit-men, Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) on a mission to get back s stolen suitcase for their boss, mobster Marsellus Wallace. In the process, Marseuuls asks Vincent to take out his wife, Mia, while he is out of town. Unfortunately, like everything in this movie, things get a little out of hand when it comes to Mia. Pulp Fiction everything from sex to drug overdoses to ketchup jokes",Null,0,2,10 May 2013
