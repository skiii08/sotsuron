The Blair Witch Project," If you go down to the woods today you'll be sure of a big surprise!!
","The Blair Witch Project does not use much blood or gore and there are not any murders to be actually seen the film but is still mortifying and could be somewhat exciting for those who like being put in the victims shoes as it makes you imagine being lost (in the woods) as we have all been at some point in life. The build up to the lost scenes are well done as it gives us a hint of what is to come but it also distorts what is to come by not telling us a single clear insight into what is to come which keeps us wondering what could the horror ahead really be. It makes a simple thing of walking through a lot of trees seem much more scary and makes you feel more vulnerable because of it. Even the scenes of daytime are unnerving and the reasonably wide spaces between the trees gives a sense of universal space from help and the daytime makes it worse because of the fact that they cannot see any signs of humanity. The only flaw to the film is the sense of direct action, the fact that there is not anything very explicit apart from the fingers shown it makes us wonder whether if a bit more money had been spent on the film it could have been a bit better and also if the murderer had had more involvement or made an appearance. However, the film is still a very horrific and also very thrilling film. The way it has been filmed contributes significantly to the horror and realism of the film as it feels like we are one of the victims as it puts us in the driving seat to nowhere.",8,0,1,7 November 2006
