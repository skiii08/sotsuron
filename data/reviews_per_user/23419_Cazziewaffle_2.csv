The Blair Witch Project," That was meant to be one of the scariest films ever?? I don't think so!
","Three teenagers disappear in the woods of Burkittesville, Maryland whilst filming a documentary about the legend of the 'Blair Witch'. A year later their footage is found.It's hard to know how to review this film, because the only reason it was thought to be so unbelievably scary is the great advertising idea advertise it as if it was real! If I had watched it believing it was real, I would have been freakin terrified. I would have felt the terror of the actors; I would have felt the frustration and the anger; I would have heard every tiny noise they heard and I'd have probably been hoping that they got out there alive, even though I knew they had been missing for a year, so it wasn't really likely and I would have loved (well, be left wondering by) the ending! But I didn't. I saw it knowing it was false and I felt.. not much. From the beginning the characters were already annoying me, and they just got worse as the film went so it was hard to feel anything for them; I laughed in disbelief at the ridiculous things they did (One of them purposefully kicked the map into the river when they were already lost (???)); and the repetition of them running around the woods screaming at each other and then sitting in the tents terrified of the noises they could hear outside, yet still trying to capture what it was on film, got a little tiring.And then there is the famous ending not so great after all! But again, would have been effective if you believed it. The only thing that still works though is the use of the idea that it's scarier when you can't see what is out there. This was used to good effect... up to a point. There are a lot of shots where it's all just pitch black and all you can hear is their frantic whispering about what the hell it is that is out there, or, in some cases, just silence and you're just waiting to see if something passes by, but this is used to often and it got too routine by the end.And I have to say I loved the hand held camera style of filming, very effective and I have to give credit to the actors they were great! I would have believed them! But it doesn't leave any real affect on you, so my advice: don't watch it expecting much.",4,4,9,7 January 2006
The Island," Not your average action movie!
","Michael Bay's 'The Island' seemed to be everything you'd expect from your average, typical, Hollywood type summer blockbuster the attractive actors, in this case, Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor; a hell of a lot of over-the-top action and a seemingly incoherent plot Definitely your typical cheesy-type popcorn blockbuster! But, is that really all there is to this movie? Set in the not-so-far future, the year 2019, the world, as we know it, has apparently been contaminated and all the survivors are kept in a carefully controlled, contamination-free environment. The only thing keeping any of them going is the idea that they maybe chosen to be sent to 'The Island', the last contamination free zone on the planet. Lincoln Six-Echo (McGregor) questions his existence, and rightly so, as he discovers that they're all actually human clones, and he escapes taking his best friend Jordan Two-Delta (Johansson) with him, and they run for their lives as they are pursued by the scientists behind their existence.Compared to other not-so-great Michael Bay movies such as 'Armageddon' (you can't get a more typical Hollywood summer blockbuster!) and 'Pearl Harbor' (ok, I wouldn't really call that your typical action movie, but it's definitely typically Hollywood!), 'The Island' is actually quite good.For one, they seemed to put more effort into the story. Yes it is set in the future, but only 14 years ahead so they could have some futuristic elements (some awesome looking trains and your expected advanced technology) but it was nicely mixed with the present day, so it wasn't too far detached from the world as we know it, which made the whole prospect seem a lot more real and actually quite unsettling. And they threw some interesting thoughts of morality in them, which helps edge the film towards being thought provoking! The cast do well in their parts. Better than expected, as I never really expect anything from actors in action movies. But it does help that you have a cast that have proved to actually be able to act slightly better than your average actor. McGregor and Johansson had the chemistry needed, and they definitely could hold the film. But the supporting cast definitely stood out too. Steve Buscemi was great at giving the comic relief needed; Sean Bean was extremely convincing as the sinister scientist behind it all, and Djimon Hounsou brings some unexpected depth to his character, the guy hunting the clones. In fact, all the cast bring some depth to their characters, which I found unexpected and refreshing to see in an action movie.The action was your usual over-the-top action; car chases, explosions, and stunts you can't believe anyone survives. It's nothing you haven't seen before, and these were the parts in which the movie dragged and definitely helped make it your average action movie.So, for once, it was the story and the cast that made the movie more interesting and not a complete waste of your time! I'd say see it if you're a big fan of the action, and if you like sci-fi.. or if you'd just like to see an above average action movie!",Null,4,7,16 August 2005
