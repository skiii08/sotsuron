Hereditary," The Loneliness of Loss
","It is quite rare that you get a horror film that is both scary and complex. One that takes a deep look into human emotions and then shifts it into a tense thrill ride. This rarity has arrived just this year. Its name: Hereditary.This diamond in the rough film centers on the character of Annie (played by Toni Collette), a mother who finds it hard to cope with the loss of her mother and another family member. She is accompanied by her son Peter (played by Alex Wolff), a regular stoner teen, and his dad, Steve (played by Gabriel Byrne), who has trouble dealing with his wife's questionable behavior. From this, I cannot give too much away. I will say that this film is in fact quite scary, with many of its supernatural moments destined to get a scream out of audience members. I will also say that it includes many themes of loss all communicated with immense creativity, as it infests the story metaphorically in various different ways.Starting off, one obvious pro of this film is its acting. It is incredibly life like, making all the supernatural moments all the more disturbing to sit through. Definitely the stand out in this film is that of Toni Collette. She goes through a wide variety of emotions, all of which to the greatest extreme, including depression, happiness, hopefulness, and insanity. Each is done with such precision, that it feels similar to watching a dancer pull off an incredibly complex dance, hitting each move perfectly. Another standoff performance would have to be that of Alex Wolff who plays Peter. From the beginning he does an exploratory job of manifesting the stoner teen, but it's when the film continues, and he is introduced to more and more of the horrors that this film has to offer, that he is allowed to truly shine. Alex himself has even stated in an interview for Goldderby, 'I have never been this vulnerable; if someone touched me I would bleed.'.What compelled me most when it came to this film's scares was simply how unconventionally it dealt with it. For example: around Â¼ of the way into this film a character, while in a car, gets decapitated. While most R rated horror films from here would have its focus be the gore, how the body looks and how much blood there is, Hereditary instead focuses completely on the character driving the car. The camera lingers on his shock ridden face and his shaky hands, holding there for about a minute, simply letting the actor portray everything about the character in that moment. Not only is this scene scary, but it allows viewers to take a breath with the character and try to comprehend how this action will affect everyone for the rest of the film.Yet another aspect that this film excels at is its visual style. The majority of the scenes inside the family's house is filmed from a distance, encompassing the entire room, and in the process engulfing the characters. This gives us a view as a spectator, making us feel as if they are dolls inside of a doll house. To me, this gives a whole new perspective of how the film should be viewed, giving off a paranoia that possibly we are not the only ones viewing it, that this is from the evil spirits point of view, viewing them all as inconsequential dolls that they have control over.That is only one of many interpretations, which viewers will probably have many of. This is largely due to the fact that the film is very vague with what is actually going on, leading to more questions than it does answer. This works to the film's benefit for the most part, until the last 10 minutes of the film. It is at this point that I felt as if this film was jumping the gun, leading me to question what exactly was going on, and most likely prompting many viewers to look up 'Hereditary ending explained' on Youtube.I will end on a warning: for those movie-goers expecting a horror movie that dwells on its blood, gore, and exploitation, you may not enjoy this. For those movie-goers expecting an array of jump scares from scary demons, you may not enjoy this. And finally, for those expecting a clear, fully explained story that offers many answers, you may not enjoy this. For although this film may not be any of these things, it is instead patient, complex, and one that I feel will stay in the viewers minds for quite some time.",8,0,3,21 December 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," A Near Flawless Disappointment
","This may have been the best a PG-13 commercial film about Queen could have been. I say this both with praise and disappointment. Praise because, despite a few obvious flaws, this film was incredibly entertaining. Disappointment because although the quality seems to have on the surface, it lack internally, failing to capture the true spirit of Queen, especially it's main member Freddie Mercury.
This film stars Rami Malek (known for his leading role in the TV series, Mr. Robot), playing the lead role of Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of the widely popular band Queen. It chronicles the band as it first shows when Freddie first got the part of lead singer of Queen, to the creation of their songs, to Freddie's lifestyle, which eventually led to him contracting AIDS, ending on the band's legendary performance at Band Aid in 1985.
Despite some obvious criticism that I will later get into, coming out of the theater I am still overjoyed that they decided to make Freddie Mercury's life into a biopic. He had an interesting life. Going from a pakistan teen with buck teeth to the multi millionaire icon singer is an exciting rags to riches story. His life also includes tragedy when he was first diagnosed with AIDS, which led to his death at the age of 45, showing yet another star who left us all to soon. This all adds up to an interesting story.
This film definitely has it's great aspects. Most notably, Rami Malek in the role of Freddie Mercury is electrifying! His presence is always felt on screen, through his iconic look, way of speaking, catchphrases (Darling is one), and body language. He shares the same presence on screen as Freddie did on stage, really adding depth to the character. I then find it likely that Rami Malek will be nominated, if not win, the oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role coming next Oscar season.
The film also includes a fair share of comedic moments, mostly coming from the dialogue. The characters in this film always seem to have something to say at always the right time. Look at this set of dialogue for an example:Brian May: That's a nice fancy dress, Fred.
Freddie Mercury: I've got to make an impression, darling!
Brian May: You look like an angry lizard!It's the light hearted dialogue like this that helps make the film entertaining and enjoyable to all.
Yet another aspect that really made this film stand out as something great was how it portrayed the live performances from Queen. It's in these concerts that all the elements come together and work. Almost magically these concerts communicate, triumphs for the characters, humor, powerful emotions, and all let's the camera work truly pop. Being this is a biopic of as popular of a band as Queen, the film has a wide variety of great music to use, and how creatively did they use it! The music always seem to heighten all the elements to create real movie magic.
Despite how many things this film gets right, and I do admit this to be a well made movie, there are some considerable flaws. One being the pace. For a film dealing with decades of strong detailed material, two hours and fifteen minutes seems almost too short. This definitely shows, as the film seems to jump around from highlight to highlight in the band's career, never going in depth into the events. Another major flaw with this movie, is the fact that it is a PG-13 commercial film. This majoraly hinders the film, as it seems to gloss over all the sex and drugs that had an impact on Freddies life. I then find it quite interesting when considering that this film was originally meant to star Sacha Baron Cohen (Famous for portraying the raunchy character Borat) and that it was meant to have a hard R rating. Some people however feel that this kind of biopic would be problematic and not have nearly the amount of wonder as this film did. Although that is certainly possible, I feel that by actually portraying Freddie Mercury how he was it would have humanized all the more, giving more weight when it affects his life, and add depth to where it was lacking before.
I can't help but think back to a scene in this film where the song Bohemian Rhapsody was first shown to a music producer. The dialogue was as follows:Ray Foster: It goes on forever, six bloody minutes!
Freddie Mercury: I pity your wife if you think six minutes is forever.Somehow I feel as if the same situation happened with many of the producers of this film, rejecting anything risky that could affect how much money this film made. Instead of doing something daring and exciting, like all of Queen's music did, filmmakers decided then to stick with something much more conventional and in the process did not encapsulate the spirit of Queen.",8,2,2,11 November 2018
The Greatest Showman," The Essence of P. T. Barnum
","From the beginning, cinema has always been about the magic of entertainment. Telling living stories, they are able portray events, moments, people, and show so many things that can never be seen anywhere else. This in essence was everything P.T. Barnum could have wished for.Now, I'm writing this review mainly do to the recent divisiveness this movie created among critics (Look no further than the 53% rating on Rotten Tomatoes) with the main critique among them all being the portrayal of the main character himself P.T. Barnum. They claim the showman to be a watered down version of the real Barnum and say even more so that the film glosses over much of the real life events that show him to be a much more complicated figure, than seen in the movie. Now this is a fair critique, character is portrayal is one of the key aspects when making a biographical picture, but in this case I think a more cheerful watered down version may have benefited it. Now I hate to sound condensing, knowing that I am not a professional critic myself, but I feel many of whom have missed the point. Barnum would not have wanted a serious, 60 year old, dialogue heavy portrayal of himself, if anything he would have loved Hugh Jackman's performance. He's excitable, happy, energetic and just like his ideas you could even call him magical. Same with the rest of the characters (Many of whom did not exist in real life) like the Anne Wheeler, the trapeze artist played by Zendaya, who has to deal with racism along with bigotry do to a romance. She too is in love with performance and has the same magical quality to her. Characters like these capture the scope of Barnum's ideas along with the imagination. If portraying real life versions of some the characters the movie (As Barnum would have hated) would have become grounded in realism taking away much of the wonder that Barnum thought was necessary for entertainment. 
The movie also goes for a stylistic choreographed style seen in many musicals. This style is especially apparent during the musical numbers, full of lights, stunts dancing and complex camera movement. The movie looks great during these scenes and even when there isn't music or dancing it's still present by having great set design and mesmerizing colors. Everybody behind the scenes must have worked incredibly hard and it it really shows. This is movie reliant on these set pieces in which it definitely holds up. There is a part in the movie where someone tries to convince him that drama/plays are a definitive form of entertainment, in which (From what I remember) Barnum says something along the lines of 'Who would want to watch people talk for 2 hours'. Views such of these from Barnum is why I believe the filmmakers decided to make the movie such a flashy, cinematic, musical instead of a drama it could have easily been. This I believe captures what his shows meant and exactly the way Barnum would have wanted a adaptation such as this to be.In conclusion, this movie did a great a great job capturing Barnum, not in sense of character, but more of sense of spirit and gives a grand cinematic retelling of his life. The movie is not perfect, it can be cliche at time and it's fast pacing can seem a bit sudden many times. However, this movie entertained me and memorized me many time and I would recommend a viewing (Especially while it still is in theaters). But be warned if you don't like musicals I doubt you'll like this.",8,12,24,14 January 2018
