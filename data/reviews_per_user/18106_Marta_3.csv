Hereditary," Don't waste your time or money
","I'm upset I spent money to see this repugnant, repellent junk. If this had been just a drama, it would have been great; a family seemingly under a curse, careening out of control like a family in an ancient Greek play, such as 'Orestia'. In that, Clytemnestra kills her returning husband, Agamemnon, in revenge for his ritual killing of their daughter, Iphigenia, which kicked off the voyage of the Greeks to rescue Helen, at the start of Trojan War.The addition of the witchcraft angle was unnecessary. It ruined the bones of a good movie, and it was telegraphed far too early and they filmmakers showed far too much. A mother, rotten to the core, who ruined her daughter's life and that of her kids, doesn't need the witchcraft to be scary.Toni Collette was wonderful, as was Alex Wolff, but their performances were stuck in a noisome film. There were no scares, there was no nuance, in this film; the theatre I saw it in was silent through the entire running time, and no one was scared. They had Gabriel Byrne, an actor that can rip apart the mesh of a movie at the drop of a hat and make it better, and had him play a man who had no emotions. Horrible film, and horrible use of the actors.",1,4,9,14 June 2018
Prometheus," I don't have the words for how bad this is...
","Yet I'm going to try. The script was a complete mess; I would think Ridley Scott would have been embarrassed to release a film with so many plot holes. Who writes major scripts like this and worse, who would green-light such a disjointed piece of garbage? I literally felt like every other scene had been removed or thrown out, because of the way the story jumped ahead with no coherence.I found nothing to care about in any character in the film; they had no compelling dialog and were not presented to us as real people. They were stock characters put in place to build the story around, what there was of it. You could have gotten rid of 99% of them and still had the same film.What the characters did do made no sense. Seasoned space travelers freak out at the site of a decapitated body, yet they wander around inside a completely unknown space for hours. They find an unknown life form and practically pick it up and cuddle it. People seem to teem in the background, yet we have no idea of their character or motivation and are given no idea of their place in the story.Noomi Rapace has zero charisma, as did her fiancé, whomever he was. Anyone could have played Guy Pearce's role, since he wasn't allowed to act behind all that makeup. I suspect someone fell in love with the idea of a robot fascinated by Lawrence of Arabia, because there was no other reason to include it in the script; it was a completely extraneous bit of business. Michael Fassbender is a great actor but even he can't carry an entire film, though it might have been better if he had tried. Charlize Theron hardly had more than seven or eight lines.The effects were good, but without a story to support them it was all smoke and mirrors. I was upset that I'd wasted 2+ hours that I'll never get back. I certainly didn't think that after 'Alien' or 'Gladiator.' I think if Scott is going to make a sequel to this, he'd better focus on the script first and worry about the effects later, because I'm not wasting more money or time if this is the best he can do today. I definitely don't recommend anyone see this film.",1,5,8,21 October 2012
Saints and Soldiers," A must-see, small-budget gem
","In Mid-December 1944, while Hitler's army blitzkriegs through the Ardennes Forest in Belgium, American sharpshooter Corporal Nathan Greer, known as Deacon, finds himself held captive with over one hundred other soldiers in a snow covered field.As panic and confusion ensue the German soldiers open fire on the prisoners, in the historical event now known as the 'Malmedy massacre'. Greer, his friend Gordon Gunderson and a handful of others escape the massacre by hiding in the nearby woods.The small band of soldiers come across a stranded British Intelligence officer with valuable information to be delivered to Allied Forces, further upping the stakes of their already dangerous situation.With few weapons, no food and a strained camaraderie, this tiny band must take on the unforgiving winter to fight their way back to allied occupied territory.Once in awhile a small independent film can show us a large part of what Hollywood has forgotten about movie making. A lack of emotions can kill what should have been a great film.I saw Saints and Soldiers last night after a year and a half wait. An old friend from the COMBAT! Yahoo group (call sign Bayonet) convinced me to see this way back when at the first chance I'd get and I'm glad she did. The theater had all of seven people in it for a 5:45 showing.My friend Lenny and I saw the film together, and I loved this movie. Lenny's dad fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and this film brought home to him things his dad may have felt 60 years ago. Up until his parents moved into a retirement apartment, Lenny's dad had a W.W.II jeep in his garage (Perhaps he shipped home a part at a time in boxes marked kitchen utensils?) My only negative comment for 'Saints and Soldiers' is a five to ten second inaccuracy about the 'Malmedy Massacre' about five minutes into the film. It gives the impression that the US POWs were somewhat at fault for the mowing down of prisoners by machine guns fire. Had I not known about this in advance unlike many other war history buffs that went to see it, I might have been tempted to walk out right then, but we didn't and I'm glad we stayed.The film does a good job of presenting fresh ideas within a W.W.II story, even if it does remind me of small parts of other war stories in places without being a bit cliché. Surprisingly, Utah as a filming location never looked so much like Belgium before, and with mostly ' history re-en-actors' making up a large part of the cast, it looked really accurate. I'm waiting to hear from 'Dodger' or 'Web455' on how accurate the uniforms are, but I understand that collectors lent the production authentic vehicles, a very nice touch.As mentioned before the film opens to us seeing the killing ground of the massacre three weeks after the fact. An excavation of frozen bodies from under the snow is in progress. Then we flash back to the day of the event. Had this film stayed true to the facts mentioned earlier, it would have been an improvement, and that's my only complaint in the entire film (Jr's note: Dad's got a fair beef here as it's supposed to be historically accurate, so I'd be docking it too). We follow several survivors as they escape coming together and forge a bond few will ever know in real life.From now on the film rates top marks from me, but I don't want to get into spoilers and will say no more about it. This film is more about the people that just happen to be involved in a war together. It reminds us that good people & bad can be a part of the sum of any specific group. It also reminds us good people die for things that are worth dying for. And bad people can die for bad things too, and remind us that the innocent (sick, women, children, elderly, refugee, etc.) also die in wars. And finally, there's a lesson about prejudice to be found here as well. The center character of the story is a former missionary of the Church of Later Day Saints, hence the title, but other than knowing he has a bible (or prayer book) and was a missionary, there's no preaching, lecturing or religious intervention in the film to be found. It's not the blood bath of Saving Private Ryan either; it had tactfully handled blood on screen as well as the issue of death. The film also included a moving original score that helps with the gamut of emotions you will feel during the show.I rate this independently made small budget gem a 'MUST SEE IT' in the theater on the big screen. Judging by all the Best Picture awards it has racked up at the various film festivals, I think that's a safe statement. The film comes to DVD on May 31st, and it's on my buy list.",8,4,10,11 April 2005
