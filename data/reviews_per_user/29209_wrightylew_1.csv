Alien 3," Why bother?
","Alien and Aliens are two of the finest films I've ever seen. The first is a twisting thriller with a class act storyline. The second is one of the most amazing pieces of 80s action you'll see. The third is a brown, dull, wet depression which just goes from bad to worse.I hated it. I'd so much rather it've just been up to the audience to decide what happened to Ripley, Newt and Hicks. But no, they felt it needed 'clearing up'.Rubbish. This is a film that should NEVER have been made. See also: Back To The Future 3, Terminator 3 and Robocop 3. The question is 'why bother?'. The answer is obvious - money.",3,424,445,18 April 2008
