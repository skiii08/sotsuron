United 93," I love all movies...except this one.
","I had heard good things about this movie so I decided to check it out. Little did I know that I was about to witness the most boring movie I've ever been unlucky enough to sit through. This movie seems like a documentary in which nothing really interesting ever happens.If you are a fan of action movies, this is not really geared towards you. If you are fascinated by the events of 9/11, this is also not for you. If you want to learn more about what happened that day, or want to see what it was like through the eyes of people on the plane, I still wouldn't recommend this movie. Some people may disagree with this but I (a huge fan of all types of movies) just didn't find any part of this movie thrilling.In closing, I'd like to say that I've had more fun riding airplanes than watching other people riding airplanes in this failure of a documentary. Don't waste your time or money.",1,4,12,13 October 2010
