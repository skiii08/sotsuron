The New World," Best sleep I've had in weeks
","Quite possibly the most boring 'epic' ever envisioned; If you like no dialog, lots of trees, swirling random cameras, trees, grass, silence, and trees, this is the movie for you. It's a mind-numbing 2+ hours that you'll never get back. You might actually hate yourself.I'm sure the actual story of John Smith and the Native American girl (never called by her name) is somewhat interesting. This version is not. In fact, it's awful. When I could no longer take it, I killed the DVD and lo an behold - I found 'Under Siege' on the Encore Action channel (for the 47th time this month). Despite being a joke of a movie, it held my interest in a gross kind of way. And it buried 'The New World.'",1,83,142,18 June 2006

","Wow. This rancid trough of gruel may be the worst movie EVER made. Let's get right to the checklist of goods: Divorced couple/failure father/mom with new rich boyfriend/torn kids? check.Indian that constantly says 'my friend' and 'sir?' check.African-American stoic President? check.Smug, smarmy, fat, know it all, government guy? check.Secret so big that it couldn't possibly be kept a secret? check.Crazy wacky mad genius living in the woods? check.Scientist with a cane and an Einstein accent? check.Hero that can drive/sail/pilot/commandeer/ride/skate through ANY kind of danger? check.I have to stop there, because that's just the first 30 minutes - but you get the idea. How this garbage gets a green light, funded, promoted, and made is beyond me. What is worse is that people pay for it - dearly. In this case, your money is the easy part of what you lose; the brain cells destroyed will not be replaced. Awful. Terrible. As punishment, I made myself watch infomercials for 2 hours and 40 minutes - including the Shake Weight, the Sobakawa Buckwheat Pillow, and Gilbert Godfrey's Shoedini over and over again to clear my mind.I'm considering registering for a Tony Robbins seminar - so I can blow $200 that could otherwise potentially be spent within 100 yards of a movie theater in the next year. I will NOT allow this to happen ever again. This film is that bad.",1,9,13,17 July 2010
Coyote Ugly," Gloria Steinem would be proud
","Have you ever seen a a dumb chick stop a bar brawl between sailors and construction workers by singing along with a jukebox? Me either.In a buttshell: Dumb girl heads to big city to pursue pipe dream of pop star. Stranger in a strange land. Can't pay the bills. Crappy apartment in crappy part of city. Must resort to 'songwriting' on rooftop of crappy apartment building to avoid bothering neighbors. Gets job as new hot girl in sleazy cool joint. Dumb girl meets nice guy with accent in music industry. Oh enough. Puke.Featuring a blockbuster performance by someone named Piper Perabo (huh?), this film is an abysmal petri dish, complete with women using T & A to sell booze to horny patrons in NYC. The cast is stereotypical in every way, and Tyra Banks even cameos as a sassy model-type that says things like 'you go girl' and 'oh no you di'int.' The other girls include a psycho hottie, a tough boss hottie, and the other fill-in-the-blank hotties. Likewise for the men - all portrayed as beer-swilling blue collars, Jamison-swigging brokers, or tequila-shooting fratboys. How original.The biggest problem? Why would John Goodman agree to be seen in this??",1,26,48,24 December 2004
Man on Fire," Man on Dramamine
","I don't know if I'm nauseous from the another robotic performance by the overrated 'Den-ZEHL' or from the nonstop Blair Witch Project stop-n-jerk filming. Okay mr creative director - we get it: you like to mix your black and whites with pastels and you like to move the camera at neato angles every 2 seconds. Enough already.This movie was awful enough for me to proclaim it in a review. Den-ZEHL was cool in 1990 - that was the FIRST time he played the role of an emotionless dolt more than ten years ago. It's getting old. Now he plays the same character, this time named Greasy. Team him up with the charming duo of Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke and you've got a comedy - only its unintentional. The plot was horrible. Nothing was believable, starting with the family hiring a drunk has-been mercenary to watch their princess. And what's up with her? She speaks like she's 8 going on 48, and that creepy diary? Creepy! Gross! Did anyone else notice that no one was pursuing Greasy? Every explosion scene had him walking in, around or through a giant fireball to save or nab someone, all the while wearing his fancy suits and not breaking a sweat in the hot Mexican sun. And do these sprawling crowded cities in Mexico have police or at least concerned citizens? I could go on and on, but I'm seriously queasy from this cinematic garbage.",1,13,30,14 November 2004
