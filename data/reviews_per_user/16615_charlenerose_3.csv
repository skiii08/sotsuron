Vertigo," Hitchcock Blonde
","First saw this film during a film course I took in college. It was with this movie that I really developed an appreciation for film noir, and the Hitchcock Blonde. The special effects were done very well, considering the time period. I loved the psychedelic , sprilling effects to show the main characters descent into madness. This effect was reflected in the camera angle going up the spirally church stairway as well.. Not very complicated as far as special effects go, yet had a lot of punch. The story line was amazing and believable , with the history of Madeline's grandmother, and the old fashioned oil painting of Carlotta with the antique necklace, that proves to be Madeline undoing was genius.",10,1,5,27 August 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Had a Great Knight with this one..
","Christian Bale's performance was excellent in this, it was strong and not a watered down version of the last few Batman movies. The viewer went deeper into the Bat's psyche to fully understand the character. Anne Hathaways Catwoman was a perfect foil to Bales' Batman. Hathaways characterization was also a strong deviation from Pfeifer's raw version of Catwoman. However I would have liked a little more history about the background of Catwoman's character..was she a ticked off sorority girl? an abused woman? more depth would have been appreciated to get the character more.. The character of the 'rich socialite' was very interesting too, with the cool twist as to who she really was I found to be very film noir. Overall was happy with this movie and it kept my attention",10,4,10,22 August 2012
Inside Llewyn Davis," Greenwich village odyssey
","This is an amazing funny slice of life story of a struggling artist navigating the music scene of 1961 New York. Llewelyn appears to have fallen into an existential funk following the suicide of his singing partner who jumped off the George Washington bridge. A new found pal points out who jumps off the George Washington bridge? Because of course if you want to commit suicide properly, you have to jump off the Brooklyn bridge! This dry humour was a real feature of this movie- it just fit with the quirky movement of the film. The priceless look of realization when Llewelyn gazes at a movie poster for the 1960s flick 'The incredible Journey' (about a group of pets that journey across the Canadian Wilderness to go back home). Was funny on so many levels!The movie unfolds like a folk music song, with Llewelyn's disappointments, search for some kind of meaning in life and a somewhat transient / bohemian existence couch surfing with a variety of people.The subtle humour of the props of that 1960s era, the staple corduroy jacket, the smoky music agents office with the secretary pounding out on smith corona typewriters, the corn cob characters performing folksy music at the Gaslight bar provides the backdrop for this slice of New York 1960s Greenwich Village music scene. It's great when a young Bob Dylan gets on stage at the end of the movie!The soundtrack of the movie is beautiful and unique and I can't get the 'Queen Jane' song out of my head! It's sung so beautifully! If you want a great movie experience that is a great look at this amazing chapter in American folk music scene, see this movie!",10,0,3,12 January 2014
