The Sound of Music," The pinnacle of American 'Musicals'
","Almost 30 years after seeing this movie for the first time, it still captures my heart.  The choreography, the music, the panoramic scenery, just about everything you could want in a movie of its era is in this film. One of those movies that really makes me proud of my ethnic heritage.",10,1,7,25 April 2000
