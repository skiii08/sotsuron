Elizabeth," Gripping Historical Film
","This is a gripping historical film.The makers should be commented.Intelligent script, fine acting, dark atmospheric cinematography and art direction all add up to memorable film experience.The movie also has the pacing of a thriller and assassinations at the end was a great ode to Coppola's Godfather saga.",10,0,1,28 January 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Unforgettable War Movie
",This the most unforgettable war film I've ever seen.The depictions of the horror of war and what is did to our brave soldiers with always linger with me.The battle scenes were so brutally vivid that I thought the director had built a time machine and when back in time filmed the battle scenes as they happened. Profound and haunting are the adjectives that come to mind in this film and it's images will linger long in my memory.,10,0,0,24 July 1999
