Ghost," True meaning of 'love'
","I for one am not accustomed to writing or critique a movie however I feel that 'Ghost' is one movie that is well deserving of commentary.First time viewing this movie soon after it's release, opened the floodgate of tears and the memories of losing my mother at such a young age rushed at me as I watched 'Sam' (Patrick Swayze) struggle coming to terms with his untimely death and roaming his home town as a 'ghost'. Choosing to remain on Earth in search of and hold accountable the person(s) that caused his death, all in the name of protecting the love of his life, 'Molly' (Demi Moore).I, like so many others have viewed this movie over and over many, many times and each time we notice different things or segments be it quite noticeable or minute; scary or not, humorous or not, but whatever the case may be all of these I feel, we lose or miss the fundamental nature.With regards to the actors, I acknowledge Whoopi Goldberg is a 'breath of fresh air' and hilarious to watch. But I truly commend Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore - they played their roles exceptionally well, portraying the true essence of this film - 'love for one another' in every sense of the word; love in the way humans were designed to do so.And, this is captured in Sam's parting words to Molly just before he walks into the light, when he tells her about the love inside, it doesn't die, you take it with you. This in itself describes what I feel is the whole essence of this awesome movie. The music and lyrics of 'Unchained Melody' encapsulate the true essence of this story.I highly recommend to anyone who has not seen this wonderful movie to do so and receive it with an open mind and heart.",9,1,2,8 May 2007
