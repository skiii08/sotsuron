Alien 3," The Director's Cut is actually watchable
","The director's cut is substantially better than the theater release, but still lacks the 'umph' of the previous two or the fourth. Scott and Cameron's directorial presence are both sorely missed, but the story does have it's merits (albiet limited). I think that Alien Resurrection makes Alien3 more watchable since Ripley's story doesn't actually end with this chapter.I have to wonder what 20th Century was thinking by allowing a first-time to direct this installment?Overall, I think 3 does add to the overall story, but only just. Thank you Joss Whedon for scripting 4 and saving the series!",7,1,4,31 December 2005
