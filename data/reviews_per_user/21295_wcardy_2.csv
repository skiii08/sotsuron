It," I love this film
","The scares are so good in this film. Pennywise is just great in this film. The scariest scene in this film for me is with the clown dolls both of those things are my greatest fear. The kids are just great my favourite out of losers it has to be Richie he is just so funny, well done Finn Wolford from stranger things to this you did such a great job.",9,0,0,10 November 2019
It Chapter Two," Definitely not as good as the first
","I was so excited to watch this film after the first. Then I watch the It chapter 2 and I was sort of disappointed, the scares weren't as good as the first but still pretty good and you could tell it was for 3 hours. But I thought the cast was amazing they were all so funny and the kids were great with the flashback.",6,0,0,10 November 2019
