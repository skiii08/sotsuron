Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," much better the second time
","When I read the critics reviews for this movie, most of them said there was not enough plot, and the actors had nothing to do. I actually think there may have been a little too much plot. Most films, television series, books, etc. have one main plot, and other subplots spinning around it. The Phantom Menace has two distinctly different yet equally important main plots. Because equal time is spent evolving these two major plots, they end up taking away from each other, and it becomes distracting.  However, when I viewed the film the second time I was able to follow the plot developments and could spend time enjoying the amazing special effects and martial arts sequences, and didn't have to struggle to fully understand both plots. The film is truly stunning, and once you fully understand what is happening, the story line is well developed as well. It's almost as if there is too much happening all at once for you to grasp it all in one viewing.  The acting was stronger in some places than others. Liam Neeson is a terrific actor, and doesn't lose much in this role. Ewan McGregor, although a strong young actor in his own right, seems wasted in this film, as he is used almost exclusively as Neeson's sidekick.  Jake Lloyd, who plays a young Anakin Skywalker is rather annoying. He speaks in a whiney voice, although this bothered me only until I remembered Mark Hammil's whiny voice in the original trilogy. Pernillia August delivers an excellent supporting role as Anakin's mother, which is probably the best acted in the whole film, perhaps Oscar worthy. In a Star Wars scale of film, I'd rate it below 'Empire Strikes Back' but above 'A New Hope' and 'Return of the Jedi'.  If you saw it once, and didn't think it was all that great, give it another chance. I promise you, you'll enjoy it more the second time around.  Rating: 8/10",9,0,0,22 May 1999
