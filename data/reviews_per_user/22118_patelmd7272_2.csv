50 First Dates," Good film
","Not being an Adam Sandler fan, we avoided this film when it was released earlier last year. The premise sounded too much like 'Groundhog Day'. We took a chance the other night when it was shown on cable, and frankly, we found the movie entertaining. There are more laughs in this than in another, perhaps more pretentious picture, 'Punch Drunk Love'.Drew Barrymore and Mr. Sandler had worked together before to surprisingly good results. They show an easy chemistry between them that serves the movie well. The idea of making Adam Sandler an aquarium doctor offers a lot of possibilities; his scenes with the walrus are hilarious.The supporting cast plays well together. A surprise was Rob Schneider, not one of my favorite actors, either, but in here, under the direction of Peter Segal, he delivers. Sean Astin, as the lisping brother on steroids is quite effective, as well as Blake Clark, as Lucy's father. Dan Aykroyd puts an appearance as the doctor who treats the young woman who has lost her long term memory.Watch it without any preconceptions, as probably it will surprise you.",5,0,1,30 January 2012
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Wow
","Wow. I love the new direction. The style fits the movie perfectly. I also think the kids acted much better in this one. I really hope they don't get rid of Daniel Radcliff, even if he does get too broad in the shoulders. You can't swap horses mid-stream. Also, did anyone recognize the kid who played Neville at first? The biggest problem that I had was that there were a lot of things the movie didn't explain, such as 'Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.' I think that it may have been hard for those who hadn't read the book to understand. It also didn't show that Harry's Patronus was a stag, which I thought was important. And Harry's eyes aren't green (which is mentioned at least once in each book), but that's a minor thing. I felt that the style fits the book well. I go back and read the first book and think 'Wow, how young they all are, how naive.' The books age, and I think that comes out in this movie. I hope they continue to follow the same path.All in all, I loved the new direction and the movie itself. I can't wait 'till the next one comes out.",6,0,0,30 January 2012
