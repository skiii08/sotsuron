The Avengers," The Animated version is much better
","I cant believe that this film got more than 6/10 rating , to even see 8.8/10 is utterly ridiculous. The story line is just cut and paste scenes . The villain is weak.OK now pause a minute , add all of the above to a bunch of funny clips that we all watch in the extras in the DVD version, but instead these clips are placed in the middle of intense (action/in the mood to fight) battle scenes, that will completely drop your focus, I mean just when you are starting to like the film and get into the mood and into the story you get interrupted by some stupid (I guess funny) clip that we could have avoided.Other than that, if you watched transformers you are not missing anything, just some blow ups that you loose count of at the end of the film.",4,5,25,14 May 2012
Godzilla," Godzilla , high budget , low ... everything !
","Do you like shakrnado ??Do you like any of the other crap movies like monster alligators vs monster snakes ???Well you are in luck, this is exactly the kind of movie you want to watch except it is high budget !!!This movie has nothing to do with Godzilla 1998.Whole different story. whole different approach.Not to mention that if you skip the first 30 minutes of the movie, you are still okay !!!At the end , the 2 points where only for the cgi and graphics, awesome job. Godzilla was great, looked real and alive.recommendation: Rent, Not worth the movie ticket.",2,7,17,16 May 2014
