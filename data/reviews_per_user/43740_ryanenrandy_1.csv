Hereditary," A genuine story - deserves to be treated genuine
","I have not thought the direction of this review out beforehand, but I want to say a lot about this to people who have and haven't seen the movie yet. The title of my review is true, I went to a screening with the entire screening room filled. Don't even think about doing this, Go a few days later from when it starts to show... it will be worth it. People genuinely treated it like a comedy, the iconic clicking noise was made throughout and I dare to say 80-90% did not understand what happened during the movie as I spoke and overheard conversations of others afterwards. This movie is a genuine story being told, comparable (but not really) to dark (the German Netflix show) and split, which I'm sure you guys will have seen. The story takes a change before you can get a grip on it, but not a dramatic plot twist, although drama was not something this movie lacked. Another good recommendation is that you see this movie with low expectations, treat like it's a backyard movie because it deserves to be seen from that perspective as the quality stand out from major other horrors. One thing that can be considered one bigger question that I did miss in this movie, but I've only seen it once so far - and do appreciate that it does not have a cheesy profession of one of the main characters explaining it in their daily life - is why did the king possess in the first place? The intention is a little unclear to me. But it seems like an opportunity to build on for a next movie, we might see a little more of grandma, how Joan worked towards these moments etc. overall I enjoyed watching this movie a lot, heavily irritated by the uninterested, crowd who did not understand what was actually happening. So make sure you see it without too many people, do focus on the emotional and intelligent qualities and don't expect too much from it for the best effect. It's a good movie but you can be mislead. I'll write a more sophisticated review when I've seen it a second time and researched more about the king. I don't feel like this is worthy, consider it a check-list for the people who want to see it.",8,5,13,9 June 2018
