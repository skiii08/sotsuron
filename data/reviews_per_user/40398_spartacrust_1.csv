The Equalizer," surprisingly good
","This was way better than I expected, although Denzil has made some poor films in his time this was certainly not one of them. Better than the original TV series with Edward Woodward, although done on a far larger budget I thought it had Paul Greengrass written all over it until I saw the credits. The music score deserves some acknowledgement too. I Only hope the following episodes are just as gripping.",8,0,4,12 March 2017
