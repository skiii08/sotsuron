Frost_Nixon," 'Frost/Nixon' is a piece of history and a potential crowd-pleaser, all wrapped in one.
","There he is, former President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella), at the end of his political life. It has been a few months since Watergate and his resignation and he has been reduced to being a guest speaker at low-profile conferences. Cue David Frost (Michael Sheen): The British talk show host is known for interviewing the crème de la crème of Hollywood and pop music and hosting shows about escape artists. With virtually no credentials in political journalism, he still decides to take on what could be considered the most important interview of the time. It's Richard Nixon's first big post-Watergate talk. Because money talks and also because Frost seems to be a safe bet as a soft-hitting interviewer to Nixon's team, he gets the job. Frost ends up 'giving Richard Nixon the trial he never had,' as Sam Rockwell's character puts it.'Trial' is definitely the operative word here. 'Frost/Nixon,' which re-tells the story of one of the most memorable interviews in American history, plays like a cross between a boxing match and the best courtroom drama you have ever seen. It centers, of course, on the interviews themselves but also allows a glance backstage. You get to see how both parties prepare for the interviews, which is actually a bit like preparing for a boxing match, and what strain they are under. Nixon wants to rehabilitate himself. Frost needs the interviews to be spectacular, mostly because he has problems selling them to TV stations.Above all, 'Frost/Nixon' has the feel of a highly enjoyable play which after all, is where it originated. Still, it transforms seamlessly to the screen, mostly because of the excellent performances by Langella and Sheen. Even though Langella has been accused of 'overdoing' his Nixon, he succeeds in capturing the spirit of the 37th U.S. president and has rightfully earned an Oscar nomination. The difficulty of accuracy versus artistic interpretation of the material is the same here as with all biopics and 'true stories,' or even more so, seeing as everyone can go back and look at the real Frost/Nixon interviews. Director Ron Howard and screenwriter Peter Morgan, whose work includes 'The Queen,' succeed in finding a balance between realism and Hollywood-esquire appeal to audiences.",8,2,3,7 March 2009
The Reader," The movie version of Bernhard Schlink's novel delivers: Kate Winslet naked, strong story-telling, fascinating take on German history.
","Berlin, 1958. Michael is fifteen when he first meets Hanna, a woman more than twice his age. Nevertheless, they fall in lust and gradually, into some sort of love. Their relationship includes an important element. Michael regularly reads to Hanna. Together they go through the world's literature, from Schiller to Chekhov.But then, the affair ends abruptly, as Hanna disappears from her apartment. Michael is not going to see her again until ten years later, and it will be in a courtroom. She is accused of killing hundreds of people as a Nazi prison guard.Director Stephen Daldry sensitively paints a picture of a young boy who doesn't really know where he's going with an unconventional relationship and the ramifications of learning something unbelievable about someone you once loved.Kate Winslet gives the performance of a lifetime as a woman without remorse. And yet, she is not evil in the slightest. She just shut herself off from what happened, disconnecting herself from her past. 'It doesn't matter what I think. It doesn't matter what I feel. The dead are still dead,' she says. In the courtroom, she seems lost, helpless, almost pathetic. 'What would you have done?' she asks the judge, and it's not a rhetorical question.Meanwhile, Michael has to battle his own demons. He knows something, a piece of information that would exonerate his former lover but can he bring himself to disclose it? Doesn't she still deserve punishment? And who is he to decide? Those are questions that will haunt him for a long time.Yes, 'The Reader' deals with the topic of the Holocaust, but it is not a Holocaust movie. It's just as much a character study, the story of obsessive love, and a tale of coming to terms with the past, personally and collectively.",8,1,2,7 March 2009
