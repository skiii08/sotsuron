Scarface," A brilliant movie! MUST see!!
","Probably one of the best mafia movies I've ever seen. Scarface shows the life of Tony Montana (Al Pacino) and his rise to power that soon leads to his ultimate downfall. The movie is rich in story and character performance. Tony Montana, is shown as a Cuban refugee who seizes the American dream and rises to the top as a powerful drug lord. His pride which was the very tool of his rise to power turns to be his ultimate downfall which makes the character ever more interesting. The action in the movie was glorious especially the final scene as the cocaine driven Tony mows down dozens of hit men before being killed himself. A true depiction of a man drowned in power and pride.",10,2,4,19 November 2015
Prisoners," a great combination of thriller and suspense.
","This movie was quite suspenseful and dark to watch. It shows many unexpected twists that has us guessing where the girls might be and who is behind it. The story leaves us clue by clue to the answer that keeps us watching. Suspenseful and unpredictable.The movie starts out with two girls form two different families kidnapped by an unknown kidnapper which is believed to be Alex Jones (Paul Dano). Hugh Jackman, who is the father of one of the two girls is convinced that Alex is responsible and knows where they are. Meanwhile detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is head of the investigation is searching for the girls and the true kidnapper.Honestly this movie was quite terrifying for me to watch. One because of the torture that is in this movie and we never really know who is the kidnapper. This movie also connects very well with real life. I mean seriously, what would you do if someone kidnapped your child? Ultimately it is a brilliant movie, if you can take the suspense and the torture then this movie is a must see.",9,1,2,23 November 2015
The Dark Knight," A true masterpiece!
","This movie is one of a kind. The plot is beyond anything seen in other movies, and I watched it several times to fully understand it.The characters roles were very complex. The protagonist (batman) is now a symbol of vigilante justice, this is shown through copy cats of batman who use his image of wild west justice to take law and order in their own hands, resulting in vigilantes doing more harm than good. Batman must find a way to symbolize law and order as the more effective system against crime. On the other hand the Joker, played by Heath Ledger, a psychopath/anarchist fights to destroy the symbol of order through chaos making the character completely unpredictable.Excellent performances, great action scenes, as i said earlier amazing plot, a true masterpiece! if you haven't seen this movie then go see it.",10,1,3,19 November 2015
Joker," A masterpiece and life lesson on the importance of treating others with respect.
","I had high hopes for this movie given the success of the Dark Knight but my god I was amazed. This was way better than I expected. A truly powerful message and masterpiece.Throughout the movie we see the decline of Arthur Fleck and his path to becoming the Joker. The movie does not glorify his actions as some mainstream media outlets claim, what people feel is sympathy for him as throughout the film he is beaten, mocked, laughed at, abused, taken advantage of, and treated like trash. Given his mental illness he cannot do much about the injustice he is given at a day to day basis. This helps us understand his actions when he lashes back at those who wronged him. We may not agree with what he did but we understand why he did what he did. We understand what drove him to the point where he transitions into the Joker and why he enjoys it, honestly I cannot imagine anyone doing anything differently in his position.The moral of the story is treat others with respect. You don't know what they're going through, what demons they're facing. This is a reflection on how society treats its less fortunate individuals. I recommend this if you're looking for a masterpiece. Ignore what critics and mainstream media says. This movie criticizes them as well hence why they hate it to the point they put law enforcement in theatres around the country.",10,3,7,22 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A complete ripoff of the original Star Wars.
","I had high hopes for this movie given all the advertising and hype about it's release. Yet when I watched the movie at first glance it seemed all action packed and well balanced, but I soon realized this movie had the same plot as the original Star Wars, only different characters. It was nothing more than a ripoff! Many people for some reason ignore this which is clear to me given its high rating of 8.4 at the time of this review. For those of you who do not see the similarities between the two movies I'll tell you; So, both movies start out with storm troopers invading a rebel base, in which their aim is to find valuable information that is vital for the rebel alliance, given that the rebels are losing ground Leia/Poe give the information to a droid for safekeeping and the droid escapes. In both movies the main villain Darth Vader/Kylo Ren, step out onto the already defeated rebel base to interrogate the surviving rebels. Meanwhile on the same desert planet we are introduced to the main protagonist, Luke/Rey, who happen to be characters who are in search for greater purpose in life and their lives forever change when they find the droid that is carrying the vital information. The protagonists are soon embarked on a mission which forces them to flee the desert planet and deliver the information to the rebel alliance. On their way, they are captured by a ship/death star but eventually escape. Once they arrive at their destination, the protagonists and the rebels prepare for an assault on the death star/star killer base, in order from not being annihilated by the super weapon. The Rebels succeed with extreme luck and blow up the entire base. Other similarities include; In both movies the main villain was once a good Jedi turned bad. Both Rey and Luke are related to a very powerful Jedi. Both main characters later embark on a journey to find a Jedi master in order to learn the ways of the force. Both movies involve a character who was seen for 4 episodes and is later killed by the main villain. Both movies involve a planet destroying weapon which is tested onto another planet(s).In conclusion, the movie is a ripoff, although the movie had great potential and good acting, it could've gotten a 10/10 from me had the writers created something new and original. But my final decision is 3/10.",3,34,41,7 March 2016
Deadpool," Do I have to explain why this movie is so perfect?
","It's perfect, enough said. This movie is so good i can't stop watching the first scene over and over again. Just look at any other Marvel movie out there and you'll find no movie as good as this one (except for the Dark Knight). Granted it has the same plot as many other movies, revenge quest, saving your girlfriend, bla bla bla. The comedy, the constant fourth wall breaking, trashing other Marvel movies for their mistakes especially Ryan Reynolds previous performance as the Green Lantern, and of course Deadpool's characteristics that makes the whole movie so epic. Deadpool delivers a movie unlike any Marvel movie made before.",10,2,4,12 September 2017
The Martian," Brilliant movie, must see.
","Great movie, great plot! The Martian is a story about a mission on Mars gone wrong when a powerful storm hits forcing the crew to leave the planet. During the escape Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by debris and presumed dead and therefore left of the deserted planet.As it turns out, Watney is still alive and is left with two options, die, or 'get to work'. The movie shows a battle between life and death. The character's positive attitude and intelligence (as well as some humor on the side) towards the situation that keeps us motivated to keep watching. In a situation where anything can go wrong it truly had me at the edge of my seat.",10,3,8,19 November 2015
