The Hangover," More fun than I ever could imagine!
","I went into this film expecting to laugh. But I didn't expect to come out laughing as hard as I was!I couldn't imagine how much effort went into making this film as funny as it was. The story, characters, and, most importantly, the one liners, were all perfectly executed.Everyone in the cinema was laughing at every joke! To pull that off is amazing! I've never seen anything like it before. To this day my friends and I talk about how funny it was.Boundaries were pushed, a**es were laughed off, tears were cried. Absolutely brilliant film!!!!",9,1,2,22 October 2010
Ted," ...I don't get it?
","I admit that the premise of Ted is actually quite clever, but the execution of it is horrible. Sure, there are a handful of quite funny jokes in the film, but when you weigh them up against the unfunny ones it's quite hard to forget them.The large amount of pop-culture references in Ted do not work and are not funny. Sure, there are a lot more in Family Guy, but they work because it is a cartoon, which is not real. Any person who experiences real life can look at this film and think 'Who says stuff like this?' It just distracted me from the film whenever a character would say something pointless, which happens a lot.The story is predictable and I don't understand who the film's audience is. It makes references to Twitter and Katy Perry, then makes Flash Gordon jokes throughout. These things are from different generations, so that prevents your audience from understanding half the jokes in the film.Overall, a good premise is let down by poor writing. Avoid the hype.",2,20,39,18 July 2012
Avatar," Visual effects make up for weak story
","I suppose the big selling point behind this movie was the special effects, and this film doesn't shy away from getting in your face with some of the most beautiful and amazing images I have ever seen.The amount of detail and love that went into the visuals is just outstanding. The scenery, the creatures, the Navi, wow!! If you see this movie, see it for the visuals.Now if only Cameron had put the same amount of care into the scriptÂ…The plot for this movie seemed to borrow from a number of sources, the two standouts being Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas. I must defend Cameron, as it extremely hard to be 100% original these days, as most ideas have been used time and time before.Nevertheless, the plot weakened the overall viewing experience. I had a feeling I knew how the movie was going to end. And the movie went for a bit too long; unnecessary points in the plot could have saved the studios a LOT of money.But in the end, the goods outdo the bads. Avatar's visuals are a good enough reason to see this film, even if the film is more of a 'look what we can do' piece rather than a piece of storytelling.",6,2,4,22 October 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," A breath of fresh air for 3D animation (and it's not a Pixar Film!)
","With the whole 3D movie craze finally becoming a normal thing, movies need to push themselves in order to 'stand out' more than the others. How to Train Your Dragon is the latest entry into the new dimension of films.I'm starting to get annoyed by the whole 3D cash-in scheme, but this film was worth my time and money. This film boasted terrific animation, some great voice work, but the story of the town outcast appears in every kids movie, so the plot suffered a bit.There is enough humour in this film to entertain both kids and adults, thanks to some entertaining characters (some of the dragon designs are fantastic, their emotions are believable!). How to Train Your Dragon is well recommended.",8,4,6,22 October 2010
