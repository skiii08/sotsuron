Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Save your $10.00
","I saw Borat today after hearing so much about the new phenomena. I had low expectations of the movie, knowing going in that it was crass and stupid, but that's okay, crass and stupid can be funny and entertaining. To my disappointment, this was just not that funny. Several of the lines were clever and I will admit I snickered along, but to say that there was out right funny laughter, no one in the packed theater acted as if this was a funny as some reviewer like to make it. A tour of Borats' home town to set up the movie is funny, and Borats' struggle with the language barrier at times was humorous. In the end I could not wait for Borat to make his way across America in as quick a fashion as I could. I wanted to leave as quickly as Borat wanted to get to California. Movies like the Wedding Crashers and Old School can carry a movie and make it funny and entertaining. This movie is a must see when it comes out on DVD.
