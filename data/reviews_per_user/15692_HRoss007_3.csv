The Hangover," Gross Disappointment
","The Hangover is one of 5 Nominees for the Golden Globe 'Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.' I don't see how this could make it to #5 out of 5! Heather Graham as an Escort is the sweetest thing to come out of this movie - really, her character is sweet, bright and charming, unlike anything else herein. Don't expect this one to make the Oscar short list.There is some mildly funny original music, as the Dentist sits down to a piano and sings 'Stu's Song' - a summary of the plot thus far. Familiar tunes are tritely placed, and the Wedding Singer is as gross as the rest of the plot.Violence, Pain, Property Destruction, Deceptive Abusive Relationships, Injuries, Drug Abuse, Vulgarity in front of Children, Throwing Money around like it doesn't matter, Trashing a Hotel Room and Automobiles - these things make me uncomfortable, not amused.My idea of Fun is something I Can Remember and Want to Remember. Some...how, I'm hoping I DON'T Remember any more of this Film.",4,1,3,30 December 2009
Stardust," Are Stars watching Oscar or Oscar watching the Stars?
","If this film isn't worthy of a few Oscar nominations, we are in for an incredible Fall Season! I had a hard time picking a movie to see yesterday. I had already seen most of the big hype cinema, and some genre's just didn't appeal to me. So I picked Stardust, knowing only what I could read on about the first page of IMDb. A few big names in Supporting Roles, Adventure / Fantasy / Romance Genre, a setting bordering a magical realm, where a young man is going on a quest to prove himself to a pretty woman he pursues.I was not prepared for the incredible impact of this movie. And still, what was it? There are familiar plot elements from many popular movies and fantasies. Kings, Princes, and Princess, Witches and Magic, Pirates, Ghosts, Transfigurations, Adventure and Love. But is a Story Line I had never heard of, well intertwined with Action, Comedy, Peril and Yearning.Was it the Stellar Performances of Supporting Roles, like Michelle Pfeiffer, as Lamia, a desperate aging Witch losing her Youth and Beauty? Robert De Niro playing the Pirate Captain Shakespeare turned Fairy Godfather? Sienna Miller as the vain and fickle small town Victoria? Was it the Music that supports every scene, even with adaptation of the familiar Classical 'Can Can'? Was it the Role or the Actress, as the Beautiful and Talented Claire Danes, a real 'Star' named Yvaine, teaches us the difference between Love and a Crush. Or watching Charlie Cox go from Awkward Young Suitor, to becoming a Man as Tristan? What I discovered here is something far more important than watching Actors on a Stage, or a Story Line with Action and Plot Elements that can thrill us, Comic Relief that can amuse us. It's not what the Characters Feel and how well the Actors perform it. The measure of a Great Movie, is how it can make the Audience Feel. This Movie brought me along into it's magical kingdom, Anxious in Perils, and Yearning for True Love.",10,1,2,25 August 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," I-MAXimum Loved it!
","Yes, after reading all The HP Books 2 or more times, I found much to love in this 'Illustration' of the 'Order of the Phoenix'. Our Cast has developed as have their characters - From a Darker, Moodier, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, to a Rule Breaking Emma Watson as Hermione. Maggie Smith as the uptight McGonagall now turns some of her Ire Against an Authority figure (Umbridge)! I wanted MORE of Everything, except maybe more Screen. I plan to go back and see this at least one more time on a big FLAT Screen. The IMAX was great for large Outdoor shots, but distorted Indoor scenes too much. I'm sure I'll have to get the DVD when it's out. I hope it has at least a half hour worth of Deleted Scenes. The Pirates - At World's End had 168 minutes of runtime, and OotP with 138 left a Lot more story untold!I wanted MORE of the New Characters - Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood is truly a Lovable Hit! Please give her MORE Screen Time and Dialogue! Natalia Tena as Nymphodora Tonks was also great to watch, but don't expect to understand her Shape-Shifting Facial Contortions if you didn't read the book! Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal of Bellatrix Lestrange was predictably evil, as those who saw her in 'Fight Club' would know she could. Maybe it's hard to mention Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge, because it's so easy to Hate the Character from her first appearance in the Trial.I really missed a lot of scenes from the book, like St Mungo's, where we should have been introduced to Neville Longbottom's parents in a more graphic way. The Battles were Graphic, but not at all as Detailed as I had imagined, like all scenes from the Ministry of Magic. So even if you saw the Movie FIRST, you Still MUST Read the Book to get it All.I just got out of the IMAX Theatre less than an hour ago. It's amazing how much of this plot could be compacted in to 2 hours of screen time - and still leave me wanting MORE MORE MORE!",9,7,15,11 July 2007
