The Lobster," Single white male
","Last year, in Amsterdam a pop-up restaurant for singles opened its doors.I was a huge success, and the tables-for-one were filled every night. I imagine it must have looked a bit like the breakfast room in the hotel where 'The Lobster' is set. Only singles, sitting next to each other, facing the large windows and enjoying the view.'The Lobster' is a highly imaginative and original film about the way our society handles people without a partner. In the film, they are forced to find a suitable partner or they will be turned into an animal (the lead character's choice is a lobster, hence the title). But in the forests around the hotel live the loners who are just as strict, but the other way around: they refuse to find a partner, and forbid other loners to find one.The film is satirical, sometimes funny, cruel at times, often disturbing, and overall very weird. But I was less impressed by it than I was by Dogtooth, director Lanthimos's previous acclaimed film. Dogtooth was creepier and more disturbing, although it wasn't so outspoken about modern society and its issues.'The Lobster' is not an straightforward run-of-the-mill movie. But if you like films that go a bit further than usual, like 'The Voices' or 'Under The Skin', you might enjoy it.",6,1,7,20 December 2015
Blade Runner 2049," Richer, deeper and more beautiful than the original
","After having seen 'Blade Runner 2049', there are lots of things to debate. But the most important one is this: is this sequel better than the original, or is it the other way round? As things stand now (november 15th), the IMDb community has decided in favour of Denis Villeneuve's film. It is rated 8,4 versus 8,2 for Ridley Scott's original. The sequel is number 62 in the top rated movies, the original is number 147. And, after only six weeks, the sequel has almost as many user reviews as the original has accumulated in 35 years.It's clear that the sequel is already becoming a cult classic, just as the original is. That is no small accomplishment and it is entirely deserved. In a way, this film is richer, deeper and more thought provoking than the original 'Blade Runner'. Maybe it is also more beautiful. And, at the same time it is a great homage to the original. Already in the first seconds of the film, it's clear that this is not just a sequel, but in fact a modern recreation of the 1982 film. The oil refineries from the original are now huge solar installations, to mention just one updated detail.But there are also differences. Villeneuve has a lot to say about modern society. The 2022 blackout is a reference to the way we tend to organize our entire lives online or in the cloud, without realizing the possible risks. The children in the orphanage are not much different to what must be happening in modern day sweatshops in countries like Bangladesh. And the derogatory remarks the lead character has to cope with, reminded me of the racial inequality in the US.As I said: there are lots of things to debate after leaving the cinema. But above all, 'Blade Runner 2049' is a superb film from a cinematographic point of view. The world in 2049 looks frightening, but also beautiful, and never artificial. The integration of special effects and on set acting is seamless. Even if you don't care about the story, which at times takes some complicated turns, just watching what happens on screen is already a great experience.",8,4,12,15 November 2017
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Doesn't stand out
","Although most reviewers on IMDb seem to be ecstatic about 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', I don't think this film really stands out. To be honest, it didn't really move or impress me in any way. In my opinion it's a decent film, with some flaws, that could have been far better if it wasn't so mainstream. I think most of the enthusiastic reviewers are young people, who recognize themselves in this story about teenagers who choose to be different from the rest. It's a very romantic story: a melancholic teenager befriends a group of progressive/bohemian/intellectual youngsters, who differentiate themselves from the rest of the school. They introduce him to parties, drugs and music from The Smiths and David Bowie. He falls in love with one of the girls, and another girl falls in love with him. There are secrets to keep, memories to share and experiences to cherish. This could have been the cinematographic equal to Donna Tartt's novel 'The Secret History'. But it lacks the dark, mysterious, Gothic aspects of the book. There are traumas and secrets in 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', but they are implied and not clearly explained. It's clear this movie appeals to young people, who perhaps can recognize a lot about their own life in the film. But to be a good movie in its own right, it should also be attractive for viewers in other age groups. I think in that respect this movie fails.",4,105,218,7 January 2013
Skyfall," Not your average James Bond movie
","A gay villain. Almost no gadgets. A low babe-factor. 007 shedding tears. No, this is not your average James Bond movie. It's as if director Sam Mendes said: I'll do a Bond movie, but I'll do it my way. Mendes seems to make clear that the old Bond is no longer relevant. The childish gadgets from Q, the mindless cavorting with beautiful babes, the over-the-top story lines about madmen wanting to rule the world: it's over and done with. Modern intelligence is no longer about spies drinking their Martini's shaken, not stirred. It's about computers, about hacking, about whiz kids trying to outsmart each other with their programming capabilities. The references to this line of thought are numerous. The villain is a hacker, embarrassing MI6 by breaking into their computer system. M has to defend herself several times about the way MI6 is still doing things the old-fashioned way. Even parliament wants to know what's going wrong. It's all made clear by Q, himself a computer whizkid, telling Bond: 'I can do more damage on my laptop sitting in my pajamas before my first cup of Earl Grey than you can do in a year in the field.'Of course, it's impossible to make a James Bond movie about only computers, hacking and digital intelligence. 'Every now and then, a trigger has to be pulled', concedes Q. So, there are still lots of action scenes, shootouts and chases in the film. Even Sam Mendes can't ignore the Bond tradition and the commercial interests. And most action scenes are a joy to watch. The first minutes, before the credits, are an adrenalin-soaked succession of stunts, chases and spectacular actions. Who can deny that it's great fun to see motorcycle riders chasing each other on the rooftops of Istanbul's old bazaar? Or to see a moving train carriage being torn apart? Or to see a couple of VW's being crushed by a bulldozer? I can even forgive the makers for including the tired old scenes of cars racing through a crowded market and reducing fruit stalls to splinters and pulp. The new era of intelligence is also symbolized by setting some action in the most dynamic city in the world: Shanghai. These scenes are the best in the movie. The scene of Bond shadowing a hit-man on a skyscraper with the neon of the surrounding city reflected in the glass of the building, is cinematographic perfection. Here, cinematographer Roger Deakins shows that Skyfall is no run-of-the-mill Bond film. The ambition was not just to make the 23rd Bond movie, but to make a really good movie in itself. Some say Skyfall is the best Bond ever. And according to the IMDb-rating, it is. It's the only one in the top-250. It seems Mendes's message to renew the Bond-theme is commercially successful. Personally, I think the best Bond is still to be made. Skyfall does try to get rid of the more ridiculous and over-the-top aspects of most Bond movies, but there is still an excessive amount of violence (it would be interesting to do the body count), there are still crowd pleasers like a crashing Underground train and a helicopter going down. I'm waiting for the Bond movie that relies mainly on sharp dialogue, good atmosphere, tongue-in-cheek humour and a credible storyline.",6,3,9,17 November 2012
Child 44," Too many weak points
","A crime thriller, set in the Soviet Union during the Stalin era: it sounds like a good idea. And it probably is, but unfortunately 'Child 44' doesn't have what it takes to be a really good film. Some things are well done: the oppressing atmosphere of living in a police state, and the courage it takes to go against of the powers that be, are very convincing. That's partly because of the excellent cinematography, full of grey colours conveying the joyless society that Soviet Russia must have been; and partly because of Tom Hardy's convincing lead. Hardy shows exactly the right amount of tenacity to make him believable as the Russian war hero who becomes an outcast because he refuses to denounce his innocent wife, against the will of the regime. Only after he exposes the incompetence of the police force in a series of child killings, he gets rehabilitated. The weak point of the film is the script. It takes a long while before all elements of the story are clear, and the quick succession of events at the start is a bit confusing. Moreover, the story is spiced up with some action scenes that are not well executed and unnecessary. Also, the tear jerking scene at the end is at odds with the hard-boiled story. What really annoyed me (and I think I'm not alone) is the language. The actors speak English with a mock Russian accent. This half-hearted way of solving a language problem makes some dialogue almost ridiculous. Just let them speak normal English. I know, that makes the film a bit less authentic. But nobody spoke English with mock Russian accents in Soviet Russia.",6,29,53,21 April 2015
Gravity," Technically breathtaking, but a bit melodramatic
","Technically, this film is a breathtaking example of 21st century cinema. It is a showcase of modern day cinematographic technology. The seamless combination of flesh-and-blood actors with computer generated images is perfect. I was amazed when the camera moved closer and closer to the visor of an astronaut's helmet, even seemed to move into the helmet, showing the face in extreme close-up, and then turned, showing the audience what the astronaut sees when she looks out into space. Although making the film has undoubtedly been a tour-de-force, it never feels that way. The story comes first, and the technology is used to make the story possible. It's not the other way round, as is sometimes the case in other films. As a technological achievement, this film is a masterpiece. But it is not an unforgettable film. When you don't take into account the amazing technology, you're left with a rather mainstream story with an irritatingly moralizing message about never giving up and keeping hope against all odds. Essentially, this is a classic adventure film. A group of brave astronauts is hit by bad luck. Their space station is destroyed, most of them are killed, but one woman survives. After countless adventures, each of which could have killed her, she succeeds in returning safely to earth. The problem is not the scientific accuracy of these adventures. After all, this is film. And film is about the suspension of disbelief. The problem is that the story sometimes tends to be too melodramatic. When the surviving astronaut tells her colleague, who is presumed dead, to give a message to her deceased daughter ('tell her I found her red shoe'), you know this is Hollywood. As an adventure film, 'Gravity' works quite well. The action is fast-paced, going from one life- threatening situation to the other. In combination with the superb computer generated images, this is a very enjoyable movie. At least, if you're prepared to cope with some Hollywood moralizing and a predictable happy end.",7,0,1,24 November 2013
Argo," Truth is stranger than fiction
","Americans are usually very good at making films about their own historic events. Just a few examples that come to mind are 'Frost/Nixon', 'Milk', 'J. Edgar', 'A Mighty Heart' and 'The Social Network'. 'Argo' is no exception. It's a well-crafted, solid movie about a bizarre event that took place during the hostage drama at the US Embassy in Tehran. In a clear case of truth being stranger than fiction, the CIA smuggled six US Citizens out of Iran, disguising them as members of a Canadian film crew making the sci-fi movie Argo. Director Ben Affleck used this event to make a suspenseful thriller. He knows how to make a story exciting: by showing parallel developments that put the audience on the edge of their chairs. While the CIA is working on the escape route, the Iranian intelligence is assembling photo's of the six by puzzling together pieces of shredded paper. Who will be the first to succeed? Although the audience knows how the story ends, the suspense is being built up through the entire movie. Immediately after I left the cinema, I planned to find out how much of what I had seen has really happened. As it turns out: quite a lot of it is made up. Just read CIA-agent Tony Mendez's own account of the operation on the website of the CIA. (His report is titled 'A Classic Case of Deception'). He describes how the operation went 'as smooth as silk'. There was no problem whatsoever getting the six out of the country. Let alone revolutionary guards driving armored cars on the runway to stop the plane, as is shown in the movie. But of course, a feature film is not a documentary. It's okay to spice up the historic facts in order to make a better movie. Argo is very well-made, with a genuine period feel and a clever script. The only thing that bothered me a bit was the too-good-to-be-true last-minute escape against all odds. The film would have been more realistic if it wouldn't have emphasized the breath-taking thriller elements so much.",7,0,1,10 November 2012
Spotlight," An ode to slow journalism
","Watching 'Spotlight' should be mandatory for journalism school students. It's a perfect introductory course into how good journalism is done. It also shows the traps journalists can fall into: not recognizing a good news story, thinking it's already covered when there's still lots to follow up on, or thinking sources are unreliable because they have their own agenda. 'Spotlight' explains all of this, which is why it is an outstanding film.The story starts with the arrival of a new editor in chief at the Boston Globe. He is not from Boston and the newsroom fears job cuts. But the opposite happens: the new boss shows them the best news story is right in front of them: a local lawyer representing the victims of child abusing priests. The only thing they have to do, is investigate it. The journalists are not perfect heroes like Bernstein and Woodward in 'All the President's Men', but normal guys who make mistakes. The biggest mistake is that they didn't recognize the story sooner, even when they had the information. While they are working on it, they are amazed at how big the scandal really is. The uncovering itself is like a detective story: every new piece of information leads to another, until the whole story is puzzled together. At one point, an impatient reporter who wants the news to be printed, needs to be slowed down to make the story more complete. The film shows the investigation as it is: interviews, documents, court filings, and the occasional tip. The screenplay focuses on the uncovering of the scandal, and nothing else. There's nothing of the usual Hollywood sentimentality, neither is there a love story or action scenes. There's only one short shot of the sort you see in every film about newspapers: the running printing presses, the stacking machines and the transport trucks. The best thing about 'Spotlight' is that it is an ode to slow journalism, to investigative reporting, and to old fashioned printed newspapers, in a time when the internet seems to reduce news to short, fast items that are a dime a dozen.",8,2,3,6 February 2016
Juno," Oscar would be well deserved
","What I really liked about this movie is the multi-dimensional approach. Just take the characters. They turn out to be just a little different than you thought they'd be. Juno is a nice girl, but at the same time she's rather heartless. She keeps referring to her baby as 'that thing' and decides against an abortion not because she wants to save her baby's life but because she doesn't like the receptionist at the abortion clinic. Adoptive father Mark at first seems to be the cool guy who likes punk rock and slasher movies, but turns out to be a childish and immature man who'd rather pursue a hopeless career as a would-be rock star than be a responsible father. And Juno's stepmother Bren, who had hoped Juno would be on hard drugs instead of pregnant, later verbally abuses an ultrasound technician who suggests teenage pregnancies are 'poisonous' for babies. The movie doesn't take sides. Not for or against teenage pregnancies, not for or against abortion, not for or against adoption ads in the newspapers. It shows things how they are, and adds a lot of humor and witty dialog. That's refreshing, especially from a country where this kind of thing very often seems to suffer from an one-sided approach. An Oscar for this movie would be well deserved.",8,2,6,17 February 2008
Youth," Nine reasons to go watch this film
","* The parade of weird characters in the Alpine luxury resort where the entire film is set - from an obese football player with a tattoo of Karl Marx on his back to a masseuse with braces who declares she likes touching more than talking, and imitates dancing cartoon characters in her spare time. * The way Jane Fonda's character is introduced - initially filmed from the back, then showing her smile in the reflection of a mirror, and finally facing the camera, radiating maximum diva charisma. * The abundance of funny dialogue. Here's just one example: - 'Im great in bed'. - 'I know' - 'How do you know?' - 'Because you're my daughter'. * The lush cinematography, making the film a feast for the eyes. * The fact that this film is funny, dramatic and melancholic at the same time, and also surprising, entertaining, beautiful, philosophical and versatile. * Michael Caine, at 82, playing one of the best parts of his career. * The completely over-the-top video clip by Paloma Faith, which is integrated in the film as a dream sequence. * The end of the dramatic conversation between Jane Fonda and Harvey Keitel, with both faces filmed sideways in close-up, on both sides of the screen, and finally Fonda's hand on Keitel's cheek. * The overall sense of watching an extraordinary film.",8,119,169,10 October 2015
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Atmospheric, but very difficult to follow
","Atmosphere: superb. Acting: outstanding. Cinematography: wonderful. Soundtrack: very nice. Still, I didn't like this film. And that's because of its only weak point: the storyline. I have never read the book it is based on, nor seen the television series, and I completely lost track of the intricacies of the plot. I had only a vague idea of what was going on, where the story was headed and what the time perspective was (indications of the years in the flashbacks would be helpful). I watched this movie late on a Friday night after a busy working week, so maybe I wasn't as sharp as I should be. You have to be absolutely concentrated every single second to understand everything that happens in this film. Perhaps the movie was not meant to be crystal clear, and perhaps the director wants the viewer to discover all the subtleties after a second or third viewing. But then you are left with lots of scenes in which middle-aged men with stiff upper lips exchange what seems to be incomprehensible inside information. The lack of much real action might be a plus for viewers who like serious films, but it's a disadvantage when you lose track of what is actually happening.",6,3,4,11 February 2012
The Hateful Eight," Repetitive instead of provocative
","Quentin Tarantino has made so many great films that it's hard to accept he can make a weak one. Tarantino, like Hitchcock, has become one of those mythical directors who will be admired for anything they do. The standards by which their work is judged, are different form those of other, more ordinary directors.The truth is, 'The Hateful Eight' is just not as good as most of his other films. It's too long, there's not enough suspense, there's too much of Tarantino's trademark gory violence, and it just lacks the magic touch that make his other films stand out.The story is rather straightforward. Eight different tough guys are locked up in a hut during a blizzard. They distrust each other and end up shooting and killing. The characters are predictable, the shootouts made me yawn and the snappy dialogue is missing. There is only one surprising moment, with a subsequent flashback to explain it, but the buildup is just so slow and boring that this temporary source of excitement doesn't compensate for the tedious and uninteresting chapters preceding it.After eight films, we know that Tarantino can get away with anything. He doesn't have to show it one more time. The splattering brains, the sadistic violence, the abundant use of the word n****r: we've seen it all before. And now, it's boring instead of daring, repetitive instead of provocative.",5,2,9,24 January 2016
Black Mass," Impressive crime thriller
","'Black Mass' reminded me of two things.One: Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed'. Also set in South Boston, also about the ties between the Boston crime scene and law enforcement agencies, also focusing on the characters of two men. The difference is that 'The Departed' is about infiltration, and 'Black Mass' is about cooperation.Two: the so-called IRT-affair, a scandal that shocked the Netherlands in the nineties. Police forces had knowingly turned a blind eye on large scale cocaine smuggling, hoping to get information in return. After a parliamentary inquiry had uncovered the scandal, investigation methods were changed thoroughly.In 'Black Mass', the Boston branch of the FBI gets involved in a similar affair. It's based on true events, involving the close ties between FBI agent John Connolly and crime lord James 'Whitey' Bulger. Both men grew up in the streets of South Boston, developing an unwritten code of honour that served them both well.The movie shows excellently how both men are slowly stretching the limits they are prepared to cross. Connolly knows he goes too far by protecting a murderer and drugs trader, but goes on regardlessly, driven by his code of honour and above all his ego and burning ambition. Bulger, on the other hand, at first is hesitant about cooperating with the FBI, but tells himself it is alright because it is a business alliance instead of an information exchange.Some reviewers complain that this is a crime movie without crime. That's true, but that is exactly why I liked this film. It is about the psychological development of two men, who are not really friends, but use each other in their mutual interest. The film shows very convincingly how they are slowly but surely digging their own grave.The performances are great. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the ice cold psychopath and manipulator Bulger is Oscar material. But Joel Edgerton is just as impressive as the streetwise and egotistical FBI agent John Connolly.The pacing and the structure of the film are just right. There are some interesting side stories, such as Bulger's relationship with his brother, the politician Billy Bulger, and the death of his baby son. Also, the respective wives of Connolly and Bulger get some interesting screen time. But overall, the story keeps focused on the downward spiral, caused by the cooperation between the two men.Director Scott Cooper is no Scorsese, of course. But nevertheless, this film is an impressive, well-made and entertaining crime thriller.",8,2,5,4 January 2016
Life of Pi," Stunning
","Stunning. That's the only appropriate word to describe this film. Almost every minute, Ang Lee has some visual treat in store that makes you wonder: how did he do it? Already during the opening credits, with paradise-like scenes from a zoo, you know that this film is going to be a feast of spectacular images. It's not just the scenes with the boy and the tiger on the lifeboat. That in itself is a marvelous accomplishment for a film maker. But it's so much more. The way Lee uses visual effects makes this film a sort of cinematographic fairytale. Everything is colourful, bright, beautiful and a bit unreal. Of course, we know how Ang Lee did it: with computers. But the fact that a lot of what you see is computer generated, doesn't make it less impressive. Lee is able to tell a story with computer generated images that can make the audience laugh, shiver, an perhaps even cry. At the end of the film, the audience understands how Pi feels about the tiger. And that's not because of the special effects, but because of the way Lee has told the story. You could argue that it's just that: a sort of fairytale. There's no deeper meaning, no link to the real world. 'Life of Pi' is a visual showcase, not a gripping realistic drama. But that didn't bother me. I was awed by what I saw. Perhaps the film could have been more focused. The references to religion ('thank you Vishnu, for letting me know Jesus') are a bit out of place. I suppose the philosophical and religious aspects of the story are much more elaborated in the book than in the film. Also, the visit to the floating island with the meerkats could just as well have been left out, because it isn't really necessary for the story. That was the only part of the film I thought was a bit overdone. But then again, without it we would have missed some spectacular visual effects. And that's what it's all about in this film.",8,1,3,19 January 2013
Interstellar," Disappointing
","So, did I get this right? The essence of time-space relativity is that you're able to see a younger version of yourself from behind a bookcase, and shout in vain that you shouldn't do what you're about to do? Yes, that's how silly this movie is. 'Interstellar' is supposed to be a film exploring Einstein's relativity theory. It shows how space travelers enter a 'wormhole' to find new planets where they can find a future for mankind, which is suffering from heat, drought and hunger on planet Earth. By doing so, they enter a parallel time frame where one hour equals seven years on earth. The problem is that the film is tackling this subject in such a clumsy way that it makes you laugh rather than anything else. Take the robots that assist the space travelers during their voyage through time and space. Are we really to believe that thinking computers in the future would take the form of clunky metal boxes, assembled in such a way that they can walk on two legs? I would suppose an intelligent operating system for a smart phone or iPad would be much more convenient. In that respect, 'Her' was much more realistic. I could go on. How about a top scientist saying things like: 'Only love transcends time and space, so why don't we put our trust in that?' Or how about handing the command of the space ship that's supposed to save the human race to a farmer who finds the secret launching pad by coincidence? And how about the only woman in the crew being in love with another space traveler who is lost somewhere on another planet? Apart from this, there are several other things about this film I didn't like. The over-the-top soundtrack, filled with some sort of church organ music. The artificial dialogues, mostly intended to explain unexplainable things. The numerous melodramatic and tear-jerking scenes. The subtle message that love is superior to science. The countless scenes of the space ship shuddering and rattling, as if it were a Boeing flying through a patch of turbulence. I had hoped this big budget production by a talented director like Christopher Nolan could appeal to non sci-fi fans like me. But I was disappointed.",5,123,264,11 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Extremely funny film about grief, anger, revenge and violence
","It seemed that the pregnant police detective Marge Gunderson from 'Fargo' would forever be the most memorable character of Frances McDormand's acting career. But now I'm not so sure. Mildred Hayes, the heroine from 'Three Billboards', is a serious contender. This might well be her best performance ever.The part of Mildred Hayes was written with McDormand in mind. Hayes is a divorced single mother, living with her son on the outskirts of a small, remote town. She had a daughter too, but the girl was raped and killed on a quiet mountain road not far from home. Frustrated by the lack of progress of the investigation, Hayes decides to rent three dilapidated billboards, publicly accusing the local police chief of incompetence. By doing so, she attracts the attention of the media, angers almost the entire town and causes a succession of increasingly violent actions.Although the film is about grief, anger, revenge and violence, it is extremely funny. Above all because of Mildred Hayes' stubborn character and her ability to verbally humiliate people by her extremely sharp tongue. The monologue she delivers when a priest visits her house to tell her she has gone too far, is priceless.Apart from McDormand's performance, the screenplay is another great feature of this film. The story is full of unexpected twists, gradually shifting the positions of the main characters towards each other. None of the characters are one-dimensional: they all reveal surprising parts of their personalities as the story moves forward.And then there is the overall, almost Coen-esque atmosphere of a small town full of colourful characters. There is a racist cop, a friendly midget, a smart advertising guy and a pretty girl who is so dumb she doesn't know the difference between polo and polio.It is hard to mention something negative about this film. 'Three Billboards' is, from start to finish, a great movie. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it.",9,197,333,16 October 2017
American Sniper," American snafu
","As far as I can remember, this is the fifth movie I've seen about the Iraq wars, after 'Three Kings', 'Route Irish', 'The Hurt Locker' and 'Green Zone'. From those five, 'American Sniper' is the most patriotic, the most war-justifying, the most pro-US. But it's also the most shallow and the most one-dimensional. In a way, it has the same set-up as an other classic American war-movie: The Deer Hunter. Blue collar, well-meaning young guys sign up for the army because they think it's a good thing to do. In the war, they get damaged beyond repair. When they return home, it's impossible to pick up their old life. So far for the similarities. Whereas The Deer Hunter delves deep into the psyche of the soldiers, and into the way the war changes their lives, American Sniper stays on the surface of what really happens. The film only offers simple statements and easy explanations. By linking 9/11 to Iraq, the film also deliberately makes an historical error. As a Hollywood blockbuster, 'American Sniper' is entertaining and efficient. But as the historical document director Clint Eastwood probably had in mind, it's disappointing. Not because it's too patriotic, but because it underestimates its audience.",6,3,21,3 March 2015
American Hustle," The crazy half-heartedness of the seventies
","Donna Summer was hot. Microwave ovens were new. Politicians were corrupt. Marriages were breaking up. Cleavages were revealing. (But were they really that revealing?) Yes, I'm talking about the seventies. 'American Hustle' is, above all, a portrait of that decade. It's not just the music, the clothes and the hairdo's. It's the crazy half-heartedness of this decade, squeezed between the hippies of the sixties and the yuppies of the eighties, that's captured beautifully in this film. Everything seems messed up. Corrupt congressmen get busted by the FBI. The FBI gets conned by con men. The con men betray their friends to stay out of jail. Did anything go right in the seventies? Do we remember this decade for anything remarkable? Did anybody have any backbone? The answer from 'American Hustle' is clear. And it's negative. I liked the film a lot. The story is very well-structured. It centres on small time crook Irving Rosefeld, who decides to snitch on his friend, Carmine Polito, a small town mayor with mafia connections, who eagerly accepts money from an Arab sheik who in reality is part of an FBI-setup. Sounds complicated, but it isn't really. To top it all off, there are some subplots about marital infidelity and FBI-infighting which are supporting the main storyline. I liked the way how the plots intertwine, when Irving's unfaithful wife almost destroys an FBI-operation because she can't keep her mouth shut. All actors are very good, but I liked Jennifer Lawrence's performance best. She plays Irving's mindless and selfish wife Rosalyn, who refuses to divorce her husband. Her unpredictable behaviour and crazy remarks make her scenes really stand out. Ten Oscar nominations is a few too many for this film, especially considering that 'The Wolf of Wall Street' got only half that number. But I wouldn't mind if it won an Oscar or two. Let's make that Jennifer Lawrence and David O. Russell.",7,0,4,20 February 2014
Baby Driver," Slightly disappointing
","This film has plenty of scenes that put a smile on your face. The combination of an ultra-cool baby-faced hero, a killer soundtrack and a tongue-in-cheek heist theme should be the ultimate recipe for a film with maximum entertainment value. Especially when the director is not afraid to make creative use of those ingredients. The scene of lead character Baby walking down the street to the music of Bob and Earl's Harlem Shuffle, and using everything he sees as an imaginary musical instrument, is great cinema. There are many such moments in this film, which is driven (pun intended) by its soundtrack of 35 songs that are almost without exception great music.Still, I left the cinema slightly disappointed. Towards the end, this cool, stylish and original film morphs into an unimaginative succession of shootouts and car chases, not so much different from any commercial Hollywood blockbuster. By then, the multitude of screeching tires, machine guns and crashing police vehicles has become a bit tiresome. The contrast between the super exciting first five minutes of the film and the dull and boring last fifteen, couldn't have been bigger.",5,1,5,7 August 2017
The Revenant," Impressive or ridiculous?
","Watching this movie, I had a hard time deciding if it was impressive or ridiculous. But the moment Leonardo DiCaprio cut open a fresh horse corpse to crawl into it in order to protect himself from the cold, I knew it had to be the latter.It was a pity really, because after two great scenes at the beginning of the movie, I inclined towards 'impressive'. The Indians attacking Leonardo DiCaprio's camp of fur traders is a wonderful scene. Not only because of its camera work and cinematography, but also because it shows the fur traders as a bunch of scared, clueless losers. The other great scene is the bear attack, which is a truly amazing piece of cinema that makes you wonder how it's done.But after that, the exciting action scenes make way for endless landscape shots with trees reaching up to the skies, scenes of the wounded DiCaprio crawling through the snow and miraculously surviving in the harsh weather, and dreamlike flash backs of his Indian lover, accompanied by strange whispering sounds.It became harder and harder to take this film seriously, after DiCaprio's character not only survives the bear attack, but also a fall in an ice cold river, an attack by violent Indians, a snow storm which makes him fall from his horse and collapse, and a jump down a ravine that kills his horse but not him. Also remarkable is that even in a fierce snow storm his companion is able to find dry twigs to make a fire, and that in this remote and sparsely populated territory, groups of people keep bumping into each other.On the plus side: this is a beautifully filmed movie, with some very intense scenes and a unique view of the way the American wilderness was conquered. But did it have to be that long?",6,0,1,30 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Spielberg dish, seasoned with Coen spices
","Who would ever have thought that the Coen Brothers would co-write a film directed by Steven Spielberg? At first sight, it seems a very improbable combination. On the one hand the traditional Hollywood giant of blockbuster fame, and on the other hand the unruly creators of weird characters and unorthodox stories.This could have been a disaster: a terrible clash of two styles of film making. But in fact, it is a wonderful cooperation. The film is mostly made according to the standard Spielberg recipe of big drama, but seasoned with some very tasteful spices of Coen-like creativity and dry humour.I think I recognized some very clear Coen-moments in the film. At one point the hero of the story, American lawyer James Donovan, walks into the Russian embassy in Berlin hoping to meet an official called Mr Vogel, but instead is greeted by a bunch of rumpled peasants. This is, I think, typical for the Coen Brothers. One other very recognizable Coen-moment is Donovan's visit to the East German prosecutor, who picks up the wrong phone. This whole scene is filmed in the slightly surrealistic way that characterizes many Coen-films 'Bridge of Spies' is a cold war drama. It tells the true story of a righteous American lawyer who defends a Russian spy, learns to appreciate his professionalism and subsequently is asked to negotiate an exchange of prisoners in Berlin. The screenplay is very clever, with three spy stories woven into one narrative: the Russian spy in the US, an American pilot who is captured by the Russians after his plane is shot down, and an American student who happens to be in the wrong part of Berlin when the Wall is built.Sometimes Spielberg accentuates the dramatic effects a bit too much, for example when the student tries to leave the Eastern section of Berlin and sees how the last peace of concrete closes the Wall between him and the West. But on the whole this film is cinematographic craftsmanship at its very best. The screenplay keeps on introducing new, exciting story elements, the sober but effective acting by Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance is spot on, and the period sets recreate the Cold War era perfectly. It is hard not to like this film.",8,1,3,7 December 2015
Dreamgirls," The only problem is the music
","I saw this movie because I'm a Motown fan. I really enjoyed Mary Wilson's book about her life as a Supreme, which served as the inspiration for the title of this film and the Broadway musical. And, without being a true account of the Motown story, Dreamgirls really offers a lot of nice little references to the history of the famous label. (Jolly Jenkins! The record sleeves! Jimmy's woolen cap!) It's a dazzling movie, and especially in the first part, it captures the spirit and the energy of the period. The only problem I had with the movie was the music. Visually the whole film is in sixties and seventies style, even in the tiniest details. But musically it's very far removed from the chirpy, smooth Motown sound. In fact, the big band arrangements and the scream 'n' holler ballads from Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles are the complete opposite of everything Berry Gordy stood for. He made black pop tunes, no heartfelt r 'n' b. In most of his tunes, it was all about the rhythm and the melody, not about the lyrics or the emotion. It's a pity that there is not a trace of the famous Motown sound to be found in this movie.",7,0,1,2 March 2007
Dunkirk," Remarkable tour de force
","One of the most intense scenes in Christopher Nolan's war movie 'Dunkirk' doesn't feature bombs, planes or boats. It shows three soldiers, sitting on the beach, looking at the surf, waiting for help that may never come. While they're sitting there, we see another soldier behind them. He is walking over the beach towards the sea, first dropping his helmet, than his gun. He keeps walking and disappears into the sea. The three soldiers sitting on the beach know what they've seen. And so does the audience. Not a word is said, but an awful lot is shown. This scene proves that 'Dunkirk', other than some of Nolan's previous movies, is not only visual bravado. It's not just big budget film making, aimed at entertaining large audiences yearning for the ultimate cinema experience. Nolan uses his big budget to tell us something. To give us a history lesson. To show us the Dunkirk evacuation as it really happened. Never do this again, he advises us. Never again decide to send innocent teenagers into a senseless, cruel war. The film is outstanding in many respects. One: the narrative structure is a tour de force. Three different story perspectives with three different time frames are blended into one film, showing the same events from different angles. Two: technically, the film is perfect. Without many computer generated images, Nolan lets boats sink, planes go down and bombs explode. Three: it may sound strange, but in 'Dunkirk', war has an aesthetic quality. Thousands of soldiers queuing on the flat beach, waiting for boats that are nowhere to be seen, is a remarkable sight and Nolan makes the best of it. The same with the masses of identically clad soldiers, and with the impressive opening scene of soldiers catching flyers, wafting through the empty streets of Dunkirk. Four: 'Dunkirk' is an overall white-knuckle experience. Even although we know how it all ends, the suspense is always there because we don't know who will live in the end and who won't. The minimalist and extremely effective soundtrack adds even more adrenaline. At the very end of the film, the chilling observations of war cruelty are followed by sentimental British patriotism. In my view, it's the only minor flaw of this otherwise remarkable cinematographic experience.",9,3,14,24 July 2017
Dallas Buyers Club," Lust For Life
","One of the thoughts I had after seeing 'Dallas Buyers Club', is how quickly time passes. I remember those days of spreading aids panic quite well. Living in Amsterdam at the time, which prides itself on being the gay capital of the world, I witnessed the fear from close by. To me, this seems like not so long ago. But seeing the film, I realize it must be ancient history for many people. It was a time when it was normal to smoke cigarettes in hospitals. When everyone still drove big, gas-guzzling cars (at least in the US). When mobile phones were a brand new innovation. When the internet didn't exist and you had to go to a local library to get information about a new disease. When homophobia was rampant. When doctors used mouth-caps when they met HIV-positive patients. But 'Dallas Buyers Club' is more than a very good account of this crucial period in medical history. Its strength is based on the character development, as much as on the historical events. Maybe even more. Essentially this is not a film about aids, but about Ron Woodroof. He slowly transforms from a typical Texas homophobic redneck to an open-minded person who not only accepts gay persons as his friends, but even stands up for them and learns to love them in his own way. Not in a melodramatic, tear-jerking way, but naturally, without his losing his foul-mouthed and no-holds-barred lifestyle. Much has been said about Matthew McConaughey's wonderful acting in this film. But almost just as good and remarkable is Jared Leto as his gay 'partner in crime' Rayon. Both men are complete opposites, but they find each other in their will to live, and fight the disease that threatens this ambition. Woodroof is determined to take the anti-aids treatments the FDA won't allow. By selling the semi-illegal aids drugs, he is drawn closer to the gay community most of his clients belong to. The film focuses on the characters of Woodroof and Rayon, and less on the legal war between the FDA and the aids patients. Some of the legal aspects of the story remain shady. Why has the sale of the semi-illegal drugs to be organized through 'Buyers Clubs'? Why could Japanese companies only sell Japanese drugs to Japanese doctors? What exactly are the stakes of the final lawsuit between Woodroof and the FDA? The film doesn't spell out the answers to these questions, but that doesn't really matter. We understand the main problem: the FDA's procedures are not suitable for an immediately life-threatening disease like aids. The story is divided in numbered days after Woodroof's diagnosis, counting from 'day 1' tot 'day 2265' or so, when he dies after seven years instead of the thirty days the doctors had given him initially. This is a nice and smart feature: the higher the day count, the more the audience supports Woodroof and his lust for life.",8,2,2,9 February 2014
Now You See Me," Mainstream Hollywood, but in fact quite good
","I mostly watch art-house movies, but once in a while, Hollywood surprises me in a positive way. I really enjoyed watching 'Now You See Me'. Amidst the mindless violent crap and the overdose of special effects that Hollywood usually produces (I admit, perhaps I'm a bit prejudiced) this film stands out. It's a fast-paced, well-acted and original film that doesn't give you a chance to get bored. Of course, It's light-hearted entertainment and nothing more, and in some scenes the Hollywood predictability gets the upper hand. The car chase is a tired cliché, and the developing romance between two detectives is out of place in this film. I would also have appreciated a less cheesy ending. On the other hand, the start of the film is wonderful. In four short, fast scenes, the leads are introduced. Each of them is a magician and we see them performing their tricks. It's exciting, it's funny and it's spectacular. The scene introducing Woody Harrelson is the best: he is great as a mentalist who can blackmail his adulterous victim in a few seconds, while his wife is standing by. The film is essentially a traditional heist movie (think: Ocean's Eleven, Reservoir Dogs, The Italian Job) with a bunch of specialists who come together for a huge bank robbery. Only this time, the specialists are not professional bank robbers, but magicians, who call themselves The Four Horsemen. And they rob the bank while performing their show in Las Vegas. This original concept is worked out very well. The tag line 'The closer you look, the less you see' is not just a phrase, but serves in fact as the main theme throughout the film, even up to the last surprising twist. I was also pleasantly surprised by the soundtrack. For a change, it is not full of rock songs or spectacular sound effects, but has a nice, catchy orchestral theme that is being played during the magic shows of The Four Horsemen. A little detail I didn't like is the title. It's bland, forgettable and not related to the theme. Why not 'The Four Horsemen', or 'The Eye'. Something more intriguing would have fitted the theme of illusion versus reality.",7,1,4,10 August 2013
Jackie," First Lady becomes First Widow
","The assassination of JFK is one of those mythical events in American history on which an infinite number of movies can be based. 'Jackie' is at least the fourth, after JFK, Love Field and Parkland. The viewpoint is original: not so much the assassination itself is the subject, but the way Jacqueline Kennedy handles it.Pablo Larrain shows many sides of the First Lady, most of which are not very flattering. The movie jumps between different time frames: an interview with a newspaper reporter, a conversation with the family priest, the recording of a televised tour of the White House, and the period between the actual assassination and the funeral.In all of the viewpoints, Jackie Kennedy is shown mostly as a very vain, self-centred and outright unsympathetic woman. There's no doubt her grief is genuine, but you wonder if Jackie cares more about the loss of her husband or about the loss of her position as First Lady. Immediately after the events, she seems to prepare for her next image: that of the First Widow.The film shows how she starts organizing the funeral and insists on making it a huge show. Her demands drive the presidential staff crazy, she doesn't hesitate for one moment to put her children on display and her sadness doesn't prevent her to make one cynical remark after another.Sometimes you wonder how historically accurate everything is. Did Jackie really ask the ambulance driver who takes her and her dead husband to the hospital if he knows who James Garfield and William McKinley are? Are those names of murdered presidents really what bothered her, minutes after her husband was shot in the head? The film contains some very strong and chilling scenes. The close-up of a tearful Jackie slowly wiping her husband's blood from her face in front of a mirror is extremely intense. So is the scene in which she slowly removes her bloody clothes in one of the posh rooms of the White House. And the scene in which she, days after the tragic events, had to put on a happy face for her son's birthday is also very strong.One thing that makes this film really stand out is Natalie Portman's acting. Initially I thought she had overdone the accent, but after viewing the historical footage of the televised White House tour on YouTube, I know it's spot on.",7,0,1,26 February 2017
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Absurd, funny, exciting, violent and colourful
","Can a film be absurd, funny, exciting, violent and colourful at the same time? Yes. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' combines all those elements. And I didn't even mention the most important characteristic: it is visually wonderful.In this film, director Wes Anderson creates his own universe, full of colourful characters, old-world charm and witty one-liners. The nice thing about creating your own universe is that you can make it look perfect. Every shot, every little detail and every set is flawless. From lead character Gustave H.'s purple jacket to the title of the newspaper announcing the war (The Trans-Alpine Yodel) - Anderson has given thought and attention to everything.The story is not very important, because it is merely a vehicle for the stunning visuals, the dark humour and the rapid-fire dialogue. It's all about a hotel concierge, Gustave H., who is being chased by various villains for stealing a painting. All this is set against the backdrop of the Nazis invading Central Europe (although in Anderson's fantasy world they are not called Nazis of course). Some of the scenes are very funny, but there is always a darker tone because of the looming war. Anderson doesn't shy away from extreme violence, but he shows it in an offbeat and almost comical manner.My favourite scene, in which it all comes together, shows concierges in hotels all over Europe, calling each other to help Gustave H. Each of them is shown in his hotel (with a wonderful fantasy name of course), busy doing some important job like tasting the soup or giving first aid to an unconscious hotel guest, when he is being called away to the telephone. Each hands the job over to his assistant, and answers the phone. This fast succession of little scenes is done so perfectly, it's a great joy to watch.Ralph Fiennes steals the show as the sophisticated Gustave H., who never despairs, even in the most unfavourable circumstances. He is supported by a large number of star actors, who are sometimes almost unrecognizable. Because of the amount of support actors, some of them are a bit underused. Tilda Swinton gets rather little screen time, as does Harvey Keitel.The film moves forward at a breakneck speed. You have to be very alert in order not to miss something. The plot is not always very easy to follow, and the dialogue is fast. And there are the great camera angles and the wonderful detailed sets to pay attention to. I think by seeing the film a second time you can discover lots of things you didn't notice the first time.",8,408,501,15 March 2014
Gone Girl," One twist too many
","'Gone Girl' could have been an outstanding crime thriller. And watching the first part of the film, you get the impression it is. The husband of a seemingly happily married couple comes home one day to find his wife missing. The police starts an investigation, and more and more elements point in the direction of the husband being the killer. For the media, it's also clear he killed his wife. A nice start for a crime thriller, and in the capable hands of David Fincher you're soon captured by the mystery. You presume the husband hasn't done it, but what could have happened? Just when you're busy trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together, Fincher surprises by giving it all away. In a long, flash-backed monologue, the disappeared wife tells the audience what happened, why it happened and how it happened. With the mystery now completely solved, the suspense is gone and the focus shifts dramatically. The question is no longer what happened, but how the husband will prove his innocence. Other films would go awry after such a dramatic shift, but Fincher is such a good director he gets away with it. The film even gets an extra dimension: no longer is it just the husband whose life we're interested in, but also the wife. Fincher nicely knots the two sides of the story together when, after some dramatic events, husband and wife are reunited, but not happily. I think the movie could have ended at this point. I even think it would have been a better movie than it is now. The story would have a surprising end, and the film would have a clearer focus. Instead, Fincher continues and pushes the movie off the rails. Some highly improbable things happen, the police stop investigating, and the story shifts a second time, this time to morph into a psychological drama about a failed marriage. The thriller aspect is completely gone, and there is hardly any added value beyond emphasizing elements of characters we already know. I think Fincher has been too ambitious. Instead of making a very fine crime thriller, he wanted to add elements of a psychological drama. It makes the film too long and less powerful. One last word about the acting: the lead characters are adequate, but I very much liked two supporting actors: Kim Dickens as the down-to-earth police detective, who lets her own common sense prevail over the prejudiced opinions of her assistant, and Tyler Perry as the smooth talking lawyer of the husband.",7,2,11,19 October 2014
Mr. Nobody," Visually amazing, but that's about it
","Technically, visually and cinematographically, Mr Nobody is a masterpiece. The visual stunts are amazing, the colours are wonderful and the camera-work is extremely imaginative.Nevertheless, I had a few problems with this film. First of all, there are too many ideas, which is why the film lacks focus. The story of Nemo's different possible lives is a great concept, enough to make a fantastic film. Why add Mars-travels, immortality, scientific babble, tattooed doctors and time going backwards to it? Secondly, the film is all about visuals. The viewer never gets the chance to connect emotionally with the characters. Why does Nemo do what he does? What are his feelings? Does he love Jeanne? We don't know. Before Nemo gets a chance to develop his character, he is being swept away by yet another visual effect or a twist in the storyline.If you love a visual spectacle that is a feast for the eye, this is a great movie. Some scenes are really masterfully crafted. But this could have been a better movie if it contained less stunts and story elements.",5,26,69,16 January 2010
Django Unchained," Craftsmanship, boldness and originality
","Is there any director with as much cinematographic bravado as QT? I don't think so. 'Django Unchained' is, once again, a dazzling display of craftsmanship, boldness and originality. And, above all, it has this quite unique QT-touch of not taking anything too seriously. A lot of it is completely over the top, and that's exactly why it's so much fun to watch. At the same time, Tarantino doesn't make it easy for himself. The subject of slave-trading and race relations in general is sensitive. But once again, not taking yourself too seriously does the trick. Only Tarantino can pull off a scene where Samuel L. Jackson tells Leonardo Di Caprio he doesn't want a 'ni**er' like Jamie Foxx in the house. The acting in 'Django Unchained' is superb. I particularly liked Christoph Waltz as a slick gentleman bounty hunter who can talk his way out of (almost) every situation. He is extremely polite and at the same time extremely violent. Leonardo Di Caprio is also excellent as a sadistic plantation owner - supposedly the first time he plays a villain. And there is the trademark Tarantino dialogue. Witty, funny, and sometimes absurd: when one bounty hunter asks the other if he's positive that the man they're going to shoot is really the one they're looking for, it turns out he doesn't understand the meaning of the word positive. I've enjoyed watching this film from beginning to end. There are hardly any weak moments or unbalanced scenes. No one in the film business does what Tarantino does. And that's why each QT-film is a sensation. 'Django Unchained' is no exception.",9,1,3,18 February 2013
Get Out," Race relations and violent horror
","'My parents are not racist', Rose tells her boyfriend Chris when she's planning to introduce him to her mum and dad. She's not planning to tell them Chris is black. Why should she? They're not racist.Indeed, her parents seem to be more worried about his smoking habit than about his skin colour. But the fact remains that they employ two black servants, who seem rather submissive and not very talkative.The first part of this film is a clever exploration of race relations. Chris feels that something strange is going on in the household of his girlfriend's parents, but he doesn't know what.Only in the second half it becomes clear what is going on. The movie changes radically: thriller and horror elements take over. Subtlety makes way for straightforward violence, the viewer is treated to a series of bloody killings, contrasting strongly with the sophisticated observations about race relations.This is a film with two faces: intelligent drama and bloody horror. You could argue that it's clever to combine both elements, but it's also the weak point. Viewers who don't like horror (like me) are disappointed by the bloody second half, viewers who do, will find the first part boring.",6,1,3,4 June 2017
Room," The flip side of freedom
","In 'Room', there are lots of things we don't see. We don't see how the lead character, Joy, is raped by her abductor who keeps her imprisoned for more than five years with her little son Jack. We don't see how she is liberated by the police, after she manages to let her son escape. We don't see what happens to her abductor and rapist.The director doesn't show all these things, because they distract from the theme of this movie: the way mother and son cope with their freedom. The surprising thing about this film is that this freedom turns out to be rather problematic in a lot of ways. Even so much so, that Jack starts to long for the intimacy and the routine of life inside the shed he called Room.The film shows how life in Room is claustrophobic, but also intimate and familiar. There are no unexpected developments in Room, but there is a lot of love between mother and son. Once they escape Room, everything changes. For Jack, who has never known a world outside Room, this is very threatening. He has to share his mother's attention with other people, he has to get used to all sorts of impulses, he has to learn how things like a telephone work.In this film, there is only one major dramatic event: Jack's escape and the subsequent liberation of his mother Joy. The rest of the film is rather uneventful: at first we see Joy and Jack in their daily routine in Room, and afterward we see them cope with all sorts of problems in the house of Joy's parents. Still, the film is almost never boring. The psychological developments make up for the lack of real action. And although there quite some emotional scenes, the director didn't make an outright tearjerker.",7,9,18,14 March 2016
A Quiet Place," A good film for lovers of silence
","In our modern western society, silence is undervalued. It seems as if it has no right to exist. Everywhere you go, there are sounds. In shopping malls, background music is played through hidden speakers. On a beach or in a park, people carry portable radios. Car stereos accompany our travels. Runners carry music players with small earpods, in order not to be exposed to silence.'A Quiet Place' is a good film for lovers of silence, like me. Large parts of the film have no sound at all. To be clear: it is not an ode to silence. On the contrary. The silence is involuntary. The characters are silent because they can get killed by alien creatures when they make even the slightest sound. This may sound as a weird concept. But it is very effective in creating lots of suspense. The family in the film has to be permanently on alert. The slightest error, like dropping an object, can cost them their lives. This is shown very effectively in the first few minutes of the film. This very intense first scene creates the mood for the rest of the film. We see how the family copes with the silence: by using sign language, by walking barefoot over a layer of soft sand, by retreating to a waterfall where the sound of falling water is so loud that the aliens don't hear human voices. The forced silence is a great concept for a suspense thriller, just like the racism theme was for 'Get Out'. The screenplay makes good use of the concept, and the actors do a good job. The only minor flaw are some inconsistencies in the story, which can spoil a bit of the fun if you're sensitive for it. On the other hand, this film is not about the consistency of the story, but about the fear of being killed by making a sound. It's meant to make your heart rate go up, not to analyze every story detail. In such a film, some degree of inconsistency is always inevitable.'A Quiet Place' is original, exciting and well made. That's all it takes for a good film.",8,3,6,11 May 2018
Lincoln," Spielberg shows us History
","Politics is a dirty business. 'Lincoln' shows us that this has been the case for at least 150 years. Lying, scheming and lobbying were as much a part of the decision making process in Lincoln's time as they are now. Lincoln himself isn't afraid of a few dirty tricks in order to realize his great ideal: the abolition of slavery. The film portrays Lincoln as a tormented man, torn between his political goals and his democratic principles. To make matters worse, he also has family problems: his wife is not supportive at all, and his son plans to endanger his own life by joining the war that Lincoln wants to end. It seems like this is good material for a solid historical drama. Still, I didn't enjoy the movie very much. To put everything in the right historical context, there are lots of subplots and side stories that are sometimes difficult to understand for someone who isn't very familiar with Lincoln's life. Large parts of the movie consist of politicians talking about 19th century politics. And some parts are even completely incomprehensible without knowledge about the historical context, like the scene at the Appomattox courthouse. For Americans, this probably is a very famous event in the history of the Civil War. But for Europeans these events are not common knowledge. Watching the movie, it's tempting to compare with what's going on now. When a black soldier says he hopes that blacks can have the vote 'in 100 years', I couldn't help thinking that 150 years later, the US has a black president. The final scene of Lincoln giving his second inauguration speech reminded me of Obama's second inauguration speech, only a few days ago. And the scene of Lincoln and his aides sitting by some sort of telegraph machine, waiting for news about the battle at Wilmington, is very similar to the famous photograph of Obama and his entourage following the operations leading to the capturing and killing of Osama Bin Laden. Although Steven Spielberg doesn't portray Lincoln as a saint, but as a man with doubts and sorrow, it is still a very patriotic movie. One of the strongest quotes in the film comes from the speaker of the House. When one of the congressmen says it is very unusual for the speaker to cast a vote, he answers: 'This is not usual, this is history'. That's the spirit throughout the whole movie. Spielberg wants to show us History.",5,2,4,26 January 2013
The Imitation Game," Why was I not impressed?
","It is hard to say why I wasn't impressed by this movie. The story of mathematician and war hero Alan Turing is interesting enough. It's a rather little-known but decisive episode in the history of World War II. The acting is top notch: Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightly are both great, and there's a real chemistry between them. Much care has been put in reconstructing the way the war era looked, and the cinematography is well done. The problem is that is was all a bit too perfect for my taste. I know it sounds silly, but all those well-designed sets, clever conversations and carefully constructed plot developments didn't really grip me. Some scenes seemed too good to be true: did Turing really get the idea of how to break the code because of a flirtatious conversation between his colleagues? Was Joan Clarke really the only one to finish the puzzle test in less than 6 seconds, something that even Turing himself considered impossible? Did a member of Turings team really learn from the very first decoded message that his brother was about to be bombed? I couldn't help thinking that the script writers had included these scenes to spice up the story and to please a large audience. 'The Imitation Game' is a good film about an important story that needs to be told. I'm glad I've seen it. It was just that I didn't come out of the cinema saying: 'wow'.",6,0,8,19 January 2015
Prisoners," Suspense from beginning to end
","If movies were rated according to the heartbeats per minute they caused, this one would get a top score. My heart started beating after the first fifteen minutes and kept on until the very end. That's how much suspense there is in this film. The film is very long (153 minutes), but never bores or slows down. In fact, I enjoyed every new plot twist because it would make the suspense last longer. If you like intelligent thrillers, you shouldn't miss this one. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. The story is quite complicated, but during the film it turns out every piece of the puzzle fits perfectly. In fact, some elements I only figured out after returning home. The start of the movie is very strong. Two happy families, visiting each other for Thanksgiving, enjoy a nice evening until they realize that the two young daughters are missing. Both couples react differently. After the police releases the only suspect because they can't find anything against him, one of the fathers decides to take matters into his own hands. His despair makes his sense of what's right and wrong disappear. Apart from the very good script, other strong points are the cinematography, showing cold, rainy forests in shades of grey, and the acting. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the lone, tough detective Loki, who is determined to solve the case against all odds. He works alone, doesn't have a family and never smiles. Even after the case is solved and he is visited in hospital by one of the mothers, he doesn't show any emotion at all. The film contains some graphic violence, and also has some rather creepy moments. This is not a nice, easy, polished film. It has some rough edges and a dark intensity. That's why I liked it.",8,1,1,12 October 2013
Selma," Impressive history lesson
","If there's one thing Americans are really good at, it's making films about their own history. There are countless interesting films about important periods in the history of the US. This thought crossed my mind, because in 'Selma' we see both Malcolm X and J. Edgar Hoover, about whom excellent films have been made in the past, enabling me to put everything in the right context. To have the history of your country documented with excellent films, is a great thing. 'Selma' is an outstanding contribution to this tradition. It documents an important period in the civil rights movement: the march from Selma to Montgomery, a protest march to obtain legally sound voting rights for the black population in Alabama. It concentrates on a rather short period in the life of Martin Luther King, and doesn't include too many side-stories. That's a wise choice: the viewer doesn't get the chance to lose attention or to be distracted. The screenplay intelligently switches between the goings-on in Alabama, where the black population stands up against the suppression by white racists, and Washington, where King puts pressure on president Lyndon B. Johnson to start the necessary political process. David Oyelowo is impressive as Martin Luther King. He convincingly shows all aspects of King's personality: the preacher, who is able to inspire crowds with his speeches; the politician, who knows how to play power games if necessary, and the husband, who realizes he has disappointed the woman he loves. By the way: a peculiar detail is that four major parts are played by British actors: King, his wife, president Johnson and governor Wallace.",7,0,0,21 March 2015
The Artist," If you see one film this year, let it be this one
","This film is wonderful. This film is perfect. This film is a delight. Everyone should see it. It's a feel-good movie, a love story, a comedy and an interesting historical film about a crucial period in the movie business. As an homage to the silent movies of the twenties, it's extremely well done. In every small detail, it's as if you're watching one of those wonderful silent movies. But it's more than just a pastiche. In many ways, this is a movie of the 21st century. Some extremely witty gags can only have been made up in modern times (pun intended). And there are quite a few of those witty gags. One is right in the beginning of the movie and it made the audience chuckle for the first time. The Artist begins with a movie being shown in a theatre. It's a silent movie, so we only hear music. When the movie stops and the audience starts applauding, you sort of subconsciously expect to hear clapping. When there is no sound and you realize that not only the film-in-the-film is silent, but the film itself as well, you can't help but laugh. The film is full of such visual and auditive jokes, as well as subtle references to the main theme: speaking versus silence. You can spend an entire evening telling each other which funny parts you liked best. When The Artist came out, I thought of it as an art-house release for an extremely limited audience. French. Black and white. No speaking parts. A funny sort of film for movie buffs. Being a movie buff, I wanted to see it. But it left the cinemas before I had the chance to. Because of the Oscar buzz, it's re-released now on a small basis. I saw it in a packed theatre. The Artist's evolution from extremely art-house-orientated film to a multiple award winning crowd pleaser is one of the most extraordinary events of recent years in film business. It's entirely deserved and we all should be pleased that this kind of film can be appreciated by a large audience. I can only hope that The Artist will lead to a renewed interest in the wonderful silent movies of the twenties. Go see it. And after that, watch City Lights. It's on YouTube!",8,7,13,26 February 2012
La La Land," Uncomplicated joy
","Here's a confession: I am a somewhat nostalgic person. When I hear a tune by Ella Fitzgerald or Frank Sinatra, I think to myself: what happened to this kind of uplifting, well-made, wonderful music? The same goes for musicals. The pure, uncomplicated joy expressed by the classic Hollywood musicals seems to be a thing of the past. It was an expression of postwar optimism, when people yearned for escapist entertainment. In the cinema, all they wanted to see and hear were nice-sounding tunes, dazzling choreographies, colourful set designs, and happily smiling characters. Later on, as society changed, the social dramas, the war movies and the psychological thrillers made the musicals look a bit silly.The musical didn't really die, but the happy-go-lucky feeling of those classic Hollywood musicals did. Recreating it seemed impossible. Until La La Land came along.The film captures a spirit of carefree optimism that nobody expects in 2017. The title, the cinematography, the boy-meets-girl-story, the Tinseltown setting, the references to classic films: it all fits perfectly together. In this sense, La La Land is a wonderful movie.On the other hand, it is just that: a modern-day recreation of the classic Hollywood musical. It's good, really enjoyable and fun to watch, but it's not monumental, thought-provoking or deeply emotional. I enjoyed watching it, but the hype in the media and the record number of award nominations are perhaps a bit overdone.",7,1,6,2 February 2017
Snowden," Classic, clean-cut film about a fascinating subject
","Edward Snowden is one of the most fascinating Americans alive, so it's no wonder his life has been made into a movie. After the documentary Citizenfour, it's already the second film featuring the famous whistle-blower. Citizenfour focused on the days Snowden spent in a hotel room in Hong Kong, where he invited two journalists who published the news about the massive surveillance of millions of people. Oliver Stone's new film takes a different approach and shows us Snowden's back story. His life is shown in flash backs from the hotel room scenes. What made him decide to basically give up his comfortable life and spend the rest of his days in exile? Stone shows how Snowden slowly changed from a patriotic army soldier into a concerned citizen. When he and his girlfriend Lindsay discuss the war in Iraq, shortly after they have met, they disagree. He defends the war, and ridicules Lindsay's liberal views and her participation in anti-war protests. She tells him: 'America is founded on the right to question our government'. Years later, he uses those exact words to explain and defend his whistle-blowing.The relationship between Snowden and his girlfriend gets relatively much attention in the film. On the one hand because a love interest is always nice for a Hollywood film, but on the other hand also because it is important for the development of Snowden's mindset. His work for the NSA influences their relationship, not only because they have to live abroad, but also because it seems even Lindsay's e-mail and online conversations are being tracked and placed under surveillance. Is this the final straw that makes him decide to take bold actions? What bothered me about the film is that it is a bit too clean-cut. The intelligence agencies are full of giant screens and slick technology, there are some romantic scenes, and the film looks overall very smooth. It's a rather classic biopic, without much cinematographic added value. For a subject as controversial as the NSA-leaks, and a for a film maker with a reputation such as Stone, that's a little bit disappointing.",6,40,55,5 November 2016
Sicario," Violence, suspense and emotional depth
","During large parts of this movie, lead character Kate Macer doesn't have a clue what she's gotten herself into. Neither does the viewer. And that's the strength of the film: you get drawn into a shady, murky world that never becomes very clear or transparent, but never stops to fascinate.Macer is a young FBI-agent who joins a special team of law enforcers, led by an outside 'adviser' and a Mexican ex-prosecutor, formed with only one purpose: eliminating an importing drugs smuggler. She is uncomfortable with the violent methods and unorthodox procedures of the group, but she is told that everything is cleared by the political powers that be.The film contains breathtaking scenes. One shows a convoy of black SUV's, transporting the law enforcers across the Mexican border to Juarez to pick up a criminal and get him back to the US. Director Denis Villeneuve perfectly captures the fear and nervousness of the group, which can be attacked by gang members any minute. The expected violence occurs at the border control on the way back, where they engage in a shooting amidst cars waiting to enter the US.There are many scenes like this, filled with suspense and violence. The perfect execution of these scenes is what makes this film special, more so than the script, which contains some sidelines and is not always easy to follow. A stroke of genius is the choice for a scrupulous woman as the lead character, trying to stand her ground in a masculine world without many scruples. It gives the film necessary emotional depth.",7,1,4,10 November 2015
Zero Dark Thirty," Extremely suspenseful
","'Zero Dark Thirty' is extremely suspenseful, even though we know how it ends. It shows how, by combining tiny bits of information, by patience, hard work and sheer luck, the CIA succeeded in locating Osama Bin Laden's whereabouts. We know everything about the raid in which he was killed, but not very much about the decade long hunt for him. This has been a complicated affair, with bribed informants, bugged cell-phones, mistaken identities, and yes, information obtained by torture. However, I don't see 'Zero Dark Thirty' as a film tolerating torture. It merely shows torture, in a graphic way that just as well could be interpreted as criticizing it. What makes this film special, is that it is focusing on a woman. The strong point of this movie is the contrast between Jessica Chastain's pure, breathtakingly beautiful looks and the cruel, ugly world of killing and torture around her. All she wants to do is hunt down Bin Laden, and there is nothing female in the obsession she shows for her work. There is no love interest, no relaxation, no private life. Only at the very end, when the job is done, she shows the first sign of emotion. The film focuses entirely on chasing and capturing Bin Laden. There are no subplots, no psychologic insights, no sidelines. That's what makes this film so good: there are no Hollywood-like concessions to a wider commercial appeal. It would be incredible if Kathryn Bigelow would win the Oscar for Best Picture again, after 'The Hurt Locker'. But in my opinion, 'Zero Dark Thirty' is the better film. So it would be entirely deserved.",8,3,6,10 February 2013
12 Years a Slave," Intolerable cruelty
","'12 Years a Slave' hits you hard, like a powerful punch in the stomach. Director Steve McQueen shows the atrocities of the southern slave-owners without mercy. He lingers over the humiliations, the whippings, the rapes, the lynchings. There are almost no limits to the cruelty and the sadism shown. If this wasn't based on a true story, you'd think it was exaggerated. Can a society be so cruel and relentless? Yes, because everything in this film is based on the book by Solomon Northup, an ordinary citizen in 19th century New England, who was abducted and sold as a slave in Louisiana. The long takes and the explicit display of violence are Steve McQueen's trademarks. Where other directors would turn the camera away and suggest what's happening, McQueen shows it all. The scars, the blood, the pain. This is what made his earlier film 'Hunger' such a remarkable movie. McQueen showed IRA-fighter Bobby Sands' hunger strike in its purest, rawest form. This approach works just as well to show the cruelty of slavery. McQueen's long takes, his close-ups and his camera angles are great to watch and give this movie an artistic quality that's missing in most Hollywood productions. Also, the soundtrack contributes wonderfully to the terrifying atmosphere of the movie. As do the sound effects in general. When Northup is locked up for the first time, the sound of his chains is almost more harrowing than the sight of his body lying on the floor. But in spite of its many qualities, this film is essentially a very one-dimensional one. White slave-owners are sadistic (some more so than others), violent and ruthless. This is the message that McQueen keeps on repeating, in increasingly powerful scenes. Even the white women show no pity for the slaves. And the white cotton pickers, who work together with the slaves, are not to be trusted either. This is a typical good guys-bad guys film. There's nothing in between. But that's probably how it was back then.",7,0,2,26 January 2014
Whiplash," Fear and loathing in the conservatory
","There are teachers who want to be liked by their pupils. They try to be kind persons, because a teacher can get better results when there is mutual respect and positive feelings. Music teacher and band leader Terence Fletcher is not such a teacher. His authority is based on fear, humiliation and psychological warfare. That is necessary, he thinks, because it gets the best out of people. The psychological war between Fletcher and his pupil, the young drummer Andrew, is the subject of 'Whiplash'. Fletcher humiliates Andrew, but at the same time stimulates him to become the best drummer ever. Andrew dumps his girlfriend, because he doesn't have time or energy to do something else than learning how to drum. He ignores the pain caused by the bloody blisters during the long hours of practicing. When he almost comes late for an important concert, he crashes a rental car while speeding, stumbles out of the wreck and continues on foot towards the concert hall. But when he realizes that Fletcher has pushed him too far, he decides to put an end to this reign of terror. Revenge and counter-revenge is the result. The film has the characteristics of a thriller, but it is at the same time an exciting account of how far musicians can go to get the best out of themselves. The scenes in which the two protagonists confront each other, are wonderfully intense, even when there is no shouting and insulting or even drumming involved. J.K. Simmons's Oscar for his role of the ruthless maniac Fletcher is completely deserved. Some scenes towards the end feel a bit overdone, but on the other hand, people are capable of extreme acts when pushed to the limit. Afterwards, you can ponder over the questions the movie asks the viewer: how far can you go to find talents no-one knew the existence of? What is the toll you're prepared to pay to outdo yourself? Is an extraordinary accomplishment worth anything?",7,1,5,23 February 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Captivating performance and cinematographic abundance
","Question. What is this film about? Is it about greed, like the film Wall Street? Is it about exuberance, like The Great Gatsby? Is it about money, like Margin Call? Is it about white collar crime, like The Thomas Crown Affair? The way I see it, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is about conscience. Or, to be more precise, about the absence of conscience. Jordan Belfort doesn't have a conscience. He is a ruthless manipulator, who doesn't seem to care about others. He has no decency, no moral compass, no respect for anybody. He would be the perfect villain in any film. But in 'The Wolf of Wall Street' he is not the villain, but the hero. He is the guy you love to hate. Everyone secretly admires a person like Jordan Belfort. Who wouldn't want to give the rest of the world the finger, and just do whatever you feel like doing? In Belfort's case, that means getting filthy rich, by all means necessary. The stock broker you work for goes bankrupt? You start your own brokerage. You find a woman who is more sexy than the one you're married to? You file for divorce. The FBI is investigating you? You bribe them - or at least try to. And in the mean time, you are enjoying a life full of drugs, drink, women, fast cars and easy money. Even if you wouldn't want a life like that, it's fun to watch. Despite all their talk about 'not glorifying Belfort', there is no doubt that Scorsese and DiCaprio are doing just that. Take the scene in the Investor's Center, where Belfort calls a client and talks him into an investment in worthless penny stocks. The brokers around him fall silent, stand around in admiration and congratulate him on a great deal. Belfort is not shown as a despicable human being, but as a smooth operator. Even after he gets arrested and locked up, Scorsese shows him as a winner, playing tennis on the prison grounds and talking about how even there money can buy you anything. Of course, there is nothing wrong with that. Movies glorifying criminals are usually great. 'Bonnie and Clyde' is a great film. So is 'Pulp Fiction'. And so is 'Scarface'. They make the audience suspend their normal ethics about right and wrong. When Bonnie and Clyde are killed, you feel sorry for them, although you know they deserve it. The glorification of Jordan Belfort makes for a great film. Both Scorsese and DiCaprio are outstanding. The film contains so many great scenes, I don't know where to start. The restaurant scene ('Do you jerk off?') has the potential to become classic. So does the Steve Madden speech ('We should all suck your dick'). Also great is the Tarantino-esque conversation when Belfort teaches his friends how to sell stock ('I've never seen a Buddhist Amish'). But the absolute showstopper is Belfort crawling on all fours, wrecking his Ferrari and saving the life of his overdosed business partner. DiCaprio's performance is so captivating, you almost forget to pay attention to the cinematographic abundance in this film. Already in the first few minutes, Scorsese shows how movie-making is done. We see a commercial, we switch to reality, the motion stops, the image changes, we hear the lead character talking to the audience, a car changes colour - all in one fluent succession. The film continues that way. Scorsese lets Belfort break the fourth wall by talking directly into the camera, he shows dazzling tracking shots through the trading room, and he even lets people think aloud. Add to that lots of sharp, funny dialogue, excellent fast editing and a great cast, and it's clear that 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is hard to beat as the best film of the year.",9,1,5,19 January 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," Irrational exuberance
","When Alan Greenspan warned against irrational exuberance, back in '96, he was talking about the stock market. But the Coen Brothers could use the same warning. Their best films are brilliant in their simplicity. Examples: Blood Simple, Fargo, Barton Fink. The story can be summarized in a few lines, there are relatively few characters, and the cinematography is sober.'Hail, Caesar' is the complete opposite. It has an intricate story with lots of different characters. The cinematography is exuberant and sumptuous. But the result is disappointing. The deadpan jokes, the sharp edged dialogue, the mildly bizarre characters that make other Coen movies so entertaining, have made way for slapstick humor and outrageous scenes.The film is a work of skill, because the Coen Brothers are expert film makers. And the actors are good, although most have little screen time and some are overdoing it. But the film is not extremely funny, neither particularly exciting. The pastiches of classic Hollywood scenes are the best parts, but the story about a Hollywood troubleshooter running from one disaster to the other feels as if the brothers have put too many ideas and characters into a single movie.It's not the first time the Coen Brothers poke fun at Hollywood. They did the same thing when they made Barton Fink. But that film was infinitely more intelligent, funny and entertaining than this one.",6,0,1,25 February 2016
Murder on the Orient Express," Agatha Christie, 21st century style
","It sounds like a fun idea. Take a classic Agatha Christie-story which has last been made into a film more than forty years ago, put together an ensemble cast with a mix of Hollywood stars and British stage actors, and see what 21st century film making can add to that.As for that 21st century treatment: computer generated effects can certainly spice up even a traditional film like 'Murder on the Orient Express'. I was impressed by the images of the steam train moving through Istanbul as it must have looked in the 1930's. Or by the scenes in which an avalanche descends from high up in the mountains on the fast moving train in the valley below.Another modern element that director Kenneth Branagh touches upon very briefly, is the interesting question if our criminal law system is morally just. It's a pity that the screenplay doesn't give this subject more than a few remarks, because it could have added an extra dimension to this traditional film.Apart from this, the film is what you'd expect it to be. The cinematography is breathtaking: everything looks picture perfect, from early 20th century Jerusalem to the high mountains where the train gets stuck. The stars do what they are supposed to do, but in a film like this the emphasis is more on the story and the claustrophobic setting than on the acting performances. It is a pity that great actors like Judy Dench and Derek Jacobi don't get more screen time, but that is the consequence of an ensemble cast. It was nice, though, to see that Michelle Pfeiffer is still going strong. It had been a while since she was cast in a major big budget production.Of course, the screenplay demands a rather considerable suspension of disbelief. Some story elements seem to come out of the blue, and viewers have to keep very concentrated in order not to miss some detail that is essential for the crime solving process. But that's not unusual in a screen adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel.'Murder on the Orient Express' is nice entertainment, and it is good to see that Hollywood is still willing to invest considerable budgets in this kind of traditional film. But this is not a movie that will surprise the viewer.After having seen this film, there is only one mystery to be solved: will Branagh take on 'Death on the Nile' as a follow up project, as the last scene of 'Murder' suggests?",6,1,4,3 December 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Intense, intelligent, intriguing and original
","There's no denying it: 'Birdman' is pretentious, self-indulgent and very high-brow. But it's also a great movie. It's intense, intelligent, intriguing and original. It's a film about a play that's based on a short story. The characters in the film have things in common with the characters in the play. And one of them also has things in common with the real actor playing him. Michael Keaton, famous for his Batman-character, plays an actor who's famous for his Birdman-character, and this actor plays two different roles in the play based on the short story by Raymond Carver. Yes, it's complicated. And so is the film. Because I haven't mentioned yet that the Michael Keaton character also has an alter ego, heard but (at least in the beginning) not seen in the film. And as if this weren't enough, the movie is filmed as if it were one long shot. No close-ups, no cross-shots, no sudden cuts. It gives the film a real-life feeling: the audience follows the characters wherever they go, even when they move through the corridors of the Broadway theatre, or when they're walking to a bar. There are cuts, but they are very subtle. It takes a while before you find out how it all works and connects. But once you do, it's gripping. The film also keeps on surprising with cinematographic gimmicks. The one scene which mocks Hollywood blockbusters is hilarious, but so is the scene which mocks the intellectual New York theatre crowd. As a matter of fact, Raymond Carver is my favourite writer. After I came home from the cinema, I took his collected short stories from the book case and reread 'What we talk about when we talk about love', the short story the play is based on. It's a great piece of literature. And 'Birdman' is a great piece of cinema.",8,3,10,18 February 2015
The Big Short," Best movie about the financial crisis so far
","When writing a screenplay about the build-up to the financial crisis, the first thing most people would do is simplify. The financial crisis is such a complex phenomenon, that showing all its labyrinthine aspects would surely produce a box office failure. After all, the audience pays money to be entertained, not to be lectured about collateralized debt obligations, credit default swaps and securitisation of sub-prime mortgage debt.Luckily, the screenplay writers of 'The Big Short' decided to do it the hard way. They didn't shy away from the technical financial stuff, or the complicated way financial deals are structured. They included it all, but decided to make the best of it and explain everything. A stroke of genius, because the way these explanations are done makes the film much more funny and entertaining than would be the case without all the difficult stuff.The makers of the film decided to break the fourth wall in a spectacular way. Not only do the lead characters sometimes speak directly into the camera, there are also small scenes in which technical stuff is explained by characters who have nothing to do with the rest of the story. The way Selena Gomez explains how a synthetic CDO exactly works, is not only funny, but also very clear. The film makers didn't have to include this part, because synthetic CDO's are not essential to the story, but it's to their credit that they wanted to explain even this very technical part of the debt bubble that led to the financial crisis.Of course, the basis for the film is Michael Lewis's book, which in itself contains more suspense than an average crime novel. It's about a bunch of financial outcasts who decide to bet against the housing market, because they have done their homework, made their calculations, and conclude that a lot of the financial constructions are built on very shaky ground. As the introduction to the film explains: 'They looked'.That is a great dramatic story, with a big 'David vs Goliath'-appeal. Against all odds, the protagonists of the story have to convince various adversaries, including banks, colleagues and clients, that they're right and everybody else is wrong. Most of the leads are colourful characters: the slightly autistic, barefooted, death metal playing, one-eyed investor Dr. Michael Burry, played by Christian Bale, is a prime example. Brad Pitt has a similar, but less offbeat role as the bearded, disillusioned investor who has left Wall Street behind to grow vegetables in his garden. There's a great scene where he tries to offload millions of credit contracts by calling his Wall Street network from a pub in the British countryside.A lot of viewers will at one point or another get lost in the financial intricacies of the story. But that's not a big problem: it proves how complicated it all was, and how hard for even bankers to understand. That's the main message of the film: that Wall Street was going over the top in a big way.",7,0,1,2 February 2016
Son of Saul," Hard-hitting movie experience
","This movie starts completely out of focus - literally. The viewer sees only vague shapes moving around. Is this a technical error or an experiment gone wrong? Nothing of the kind. After a while, the face of lead character Saul Auslander moves close to the camera - and into focus.And it stays this way. In the first few minutes, the camera stays within a range of 50 centimeters from Saul's face. Or I should say: Saul's head - because sometimes we see only the side or the back of his head.The effect of this style of filming is no less than spectacular. All kinds of things are happening around Saul. Horrible things, we soon learn. But we never get to see them close by. We only see shapes, out of focus, at the extreme fringes of the screen, and we hear the sounds. And we keep seeing his face, in focus. He moves around, works, does things, and all the while all we see is his face.Soon we understand where he is: in a Nazi concentration camp. Saul belongs to a Sonderkommando, a group of Jews who are temporarily spared from death to do the labour the Germans don't want to do. In the midst of the terrible atrocities, it becomes his mission to bury a boy he believes is his son.This film is unique in showing the concentration camp for what is is: hell on earth. Naked dead bodies being dragged around, desperate people being shot indiscriminately, complete absence of anything humanity stands for. It is exactly this total loss of dignity that drives Saul in his hopeless quest for a way to organize a proper burial for the dead boy.Son of Saul is the complete antithesis of that other monumental Holocaust movie: Schindler's List. While Spielberg's film is made according to all the rules of good film making, Son of Saul is a claustrophobic trip, without any possible concession to commercial appeal. The dialogue is often hardly comprehensible, spoken in three languages, sometimes not louder than a whisper. Not all the acts and events are quite clear, and only after a while you understand what exactly drives Saul.This is a unique, hard-hitting movie experience. When you go see it, don't expect a well-rounded story with heroes and villains and a nice ending. But expect to be swept away.",8,59,90,11 November 2015
Moonrise Kingdom," Hilarious, romantic and absurd at the same time.
","The mere fact that the post 'Little Things That Made You Laugh' on the message board has already 70 replies (and still counting) proves that this film definitely has the potential to become a cult classic. It is hilarious, romantic and absurd at the same time. And it's so perfectly made, with so many nice little details and funny situations, that watching it is a joy right until the very end. It's hard to find anything about this movie that's not perfect. The cast, to start with, is wonderful. Not only are the leads and the supports great actors, but just seeing someone like Bruce Willis playing a goofy policeman on a remote island is great. The same goes for Tilda Swinton as an obsessed social services officer, and Harvey Keitel as a scout master. Then there's the dialogue. Mildly absurd, and extremely funny. 'I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about' is due to become a classic movie quote. And there are all those nice little details, like the Françoise Hardy record, the megaphone and the binoculars. I can imagine not everyone will like this film. It takes a certain susceptibility to appreciate this kind of movie-making. If you want a good story, or hair-raising excitement, Moonrise Kingdom is not for you. You sort of have to get it to be able to like it. But if you do, you'll have a great time.",8,1,2,31 July 2012
Cloud Atlas," So heavy it almost gets crushed under its own weight
","What happened to Tom Tykwer? Remember, this is the guy who 15 years ago directed 'Lola Rennt' ('Run Lola Run'), which became a sort of cult classic because it was a fresh, original and imaginative piece of film making. Now, Tykwer is one of three directors who made 'Cloud Atlas', which is the complete opposite of everything 'Lola Rennt' stands for. 'Cloud Atlas' is ambitious, pretentious, bloated, and so heavy it almost gets crushed under its own weight. On second thoughts: scrap the word 'almost'. 'Cloud Atlas' consists of six different stories, set in different places and time periods, each played by the same set of actors. They vary form historical drama (a slave trader turning into an abolitionist), political thriller (an investigative reporter uncovering a scandal involving a nuclear power plant), slapstick comedy (an elderly publisher getting locked up in an old people's home), love story (a gay couple in pre-war England), to science fiction (a clone-like creature being freed in 22nd century Seoul). The stories are shown in short scenes, jumping from one to the other. They are connected, but in a very minimal way. In some cases, so minimal that I didn't discover the connection watching the film, but only afterward, reading the comments on the internet. During the scenes, there are pieces of narration about universal themes like space, time, God, love, etcetera. Even Darwin turns up at one moment. It is clear that you have to watch this movie several times to really understand it. I don't know if this is a quality. It can also be an indication that the movie makers have tried to do too much, that they have put too many elements into one single film, that they have given the audience so many messages that it is inevitable that, after seeing it for the first time, you are left confused, dazed and frustrated. I think the movie would have been better with only three or four stories instead of six, and with more clear elements of how they are connected. Much can be said about the meaning of the movie. The central theme of the six stories seems to be the quest for freedom and the fight against oppression. The implied message is that the world doesn't change, and that throughout time we keep on repeating the same behaviour. The movie is open for interpretation; those who like can find plenty of political, religious and even environmental themes in it. Apart from the gimmick of getting rid of the boundaries of time and space, I didn't find 'Cloud Atlas' particularly remarkable. The six stories in themselves are rather conventional and thin. The acting is adequate - the idea of each actor playing six different roles is challenging but doesn't necessarily lead to superb acting. The cinematography is what you'd expect for a big budget film. In my opinion, this film is special for its audacious scope, but not because it's such a good watching experience.",3,2,6,30 March 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," Not one of the Coen Brothers' best films
","I hate to say it, but from all the Coen Brothers-films I've seen, I liked this one the least. It lacks some essential Coen Brothers-features, like bizarre characters, crazy plot twists and visual exuberance. 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is a rather plain film, sometimes even boring. I wouldn't have thought I would ever have to say that about a Coen Brothers-movie, but there you go. The film shows New York folk singer Llewyn Davis, who is a loser in every possible way. He has no commercial success, he has no money, he sleeps on couches at friends' and friends-of-friends' places, and he constantly quarrels with everyone he meets. This could be entertaining if it would lead to funny situations, interesting insights or dramatic developments, which it does not. There is a sort of running gag with a cat, but these jokes are very predictable and simply not very funny. The biggest problem with this film is the storyline. There is none to speak of. We see Llewyn riding the subway, walking the streets, sleeping on couches and quarreling with friends and relatives. The only time something actually happens is when he goes on a trip to Chicago, but even that turns out to be aimless. Oh yes, and we see Llewyn Davis singing. There is a lot of music in the film. That's great if you like sixties-style folk singing (men with acoustic guitars in the style of Pete Seeger or pre-electric Bob Dylan), which I don't. Even the actors don't really stand out, with the exception of John Goodman. His performance brings back the real Coen Brothers-feeling, but is rather short. This film can be appreciated as a reconstruction of the sixties folk scene in New York. The character of Llewyn Davis is inspired by Dave Van Ronk, a long-forgotten singer who was essential to the New York folk scene. I suppose there are lots of references to real-life people and events from that scene, but from the Coen Brothers I expected more than just a film for fans of sixties folk music.",4,23,43,9 November 2013
Gangs of New York," A huge disappointment
","Gangs of New York, hyped as one of the best Scorsese movies ever, was a huge disappointment for me. First reason: the story is a clichÃ©: good guys vs bad guys. The good guys have noting bad, the bad guys have nothing good. Second reason: 19th century New York looks as if it were a movie set. Of course, it is, but it shouldn't show. And all those candles that give the movie such a nice old-fashioned, warm look! Third reason: too much sidelines in the script. The love story with Cameron Diaz is unrealistic (Vallon doesn't want her because she loved his father's killer.

Her," Love story with a gimmick
","What if computer systems would become so smart that we can talk to them, rely on them, get attached to them and even love them? That is what this film is about. I expected an original and thought-provoking story with original angles - something that stimulates the mind. Instead, I saw a conventional, rather melodramatic love story with an extra gimmick: one of the lovers doesn't have a body. This is not a film about artificial intelligence, but about feelings. Theodore, the computer-owner, and Samantha, the operating system with a mind of her own, keep on talking about their feelings. How they are getting emotionally involved with each other. How she regrets not having a body. How he regrets not being able to touch her. How they have cyber sex (in spite of her not having a body). How he becomes distant when he realizes it's rather embarrassing to have a relationship with an operating system. How she becomes distant when she meets another operating system. How she 'betrays' him. And so on. This could have been a film about how we deal with artificial intelligence, with its opportunities, and its dangers. Instead, it's about how we deal with emotions. Samantha becomes so 'human', the only thing that reminds us about her being a software system is that we never see her. Only in the very beginning she says things like 'It took me 0,02 seconds to decide about my own name'. Later on, she talks just like a human being, so the aspect of her being a piece of artificial intelligence gets lost. It would be nice to know how artificially intelligent operating systems would change our society. Would they help criminals to commit the perfect crime? Would they change our educational system? Could they be helpful in eradicating poverty? Would they help novelists to write better novels? Would we need novelists at all? Would we need musicians? Architects? None of this in 'Her'. The only useful thing Samantha seems to do, apart from complaining about not having a body and telling Theodore she loves him, is find errors in Theodore's text, which is not very intelligent at all. Spell checkers are able to do that since God knows when. 'Her' could have been an intelligent film about how computers change the way we think and behave. But it turns out to be a rather conventional love story instead. I was disappointed. And I didn't have a Samantha to cheer me up.",4,2,3,24 March 2014
