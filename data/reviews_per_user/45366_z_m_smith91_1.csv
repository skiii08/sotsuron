Black Swan," A psychological thriller that doesn't keep you guessing and doesn't make you think
","If you cant figure out the end of this movie within the first 20 minutes you deserve to sit through the rest of this boring and unoriginal piece of garbage. The plot is incredibly boring, its a ballerina buckling under the pressure of being given the lead role in a major production, Natalie Portman's insanity is given away within the first 20 minutes which makes you wonder why the next hour and a half is even apart of the movie, honestly if she keeps seeing other people as herself why would you ever question whether Mila Kunis has anything to do with outcome of this movie. So after you are given away the 'twist' you get to sit through Natalie Portman practising her routine for an hour! then the last half hour thats suppose to thrilling isn't because you already know what the outcome is going to be. Awesome, sorry Aronofsky i've already seen good thrillers like David Finchers 'Fight Club' and hey even Alfred Hitchcocks 'Psycho', so i would love to see another movie about multiple personality disorder that doesn't do anything creative or original to keep the audience guessing! Yes the scenes of the movie look nice and it does make Ballet look a lot cooler than it does in real life and yes Natalie Portman does give a good performance but who cares when the plot is incredibly boring and the ending leaves the viewer wondering if the director is mocking you, if you actually want to see a good thriller trying renting the movies i mention earlier or even Nolans 'Prestige' just stay away from this movie because it will make you as angry and offended as a movie goer as i am",4,9,28,21 December 2010
