It," More Heart than Scare - Movie must
","I am not a scary/horror movie buff or even fan at that matter. The last scary movie I saw in was 'The Ring' and I was only in the seat for the opening act then called my mom to come get me. Flash forward.I had to see 'IT' (2017). From the first trailer, I was hooked. It is the CLASSIC horror flick revamped beautifully by Andr√©s Muschietti! I know and love the story of Pennywise and think the film covered his haunting backstory well. The young teen team up was hilarious to watch interact and conquer. That is where the HEART came in. I thought the movie was structured more like a coming of age film. I actually enjoyed the real-life terror of the town's seduction to Pennywise more than the audio queued jump scares. The C or D story about how the adults of the town live in a fog due to Pennywise's historic rule was my favorite aspect of the film. Still thinking that over. From one 'scaredy-cat' to the next -- if you can handle the first crazy horror moment you are golden. Great theater movie. Enjoy!",7,4,8,17 September 2017
Joker," Looking through the bleak microscope of Todd Phillips' 'JOKER'
","'JOKER' 2019 REVIEW (no spoilers)There has been memorizing buzz about the 'JOKER' 2019 ever since the Venice Film Festival praise and rumors of an eight-minute standing ovation for Joaquin Phoenix hit the press. There was no way I was going to miss this opening night! As I passed several armed Chicago police officers surveying the movie theatre lobby, it became clear to me that all the conversations revolving around this film were extremely relevant! Discussions about violence, mental health, social status, subjective comedy, crime, movements/revolutions, and the unconventional anti-hero are all woven in the fabric of Todd Phillips' Gotham.'Gotham has lost its way' - said by Thomas Wayne sparks a tear in the psyche of the city. I believe the 'JOKER' 2019 addresses what could happen... what kind of world can explain what Arthur Fleck turns into. This film is a true origin story to one of the most widely known and repeated villains. Joaquin Phoenix's performance yo-yos between unsuitability and knowing himself for the first time.I recommend this film to anyone who can stomach the violence of 'Taxi Driver' and 'You Were Never Really Here.' Both of these slow-burning character studies have been said to have influenced 'JOKER' 2019 and it shows. There are significant character chapters throughout the film bouncing back and forth cued by music, dancing and laughing offbeat.SMALL thing about the stairs... I have a small theory/observation but do not want to say anything just yet. Going down vs. going up is all I can speak on now.Cheers, I hope you go to the theatre soon!",9,1,1,4 October 2019
