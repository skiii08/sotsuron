Iron Man 3," Made for Republicans
","This movie was made for a Republican audience. Arguably better than Iron Man 2, but no where near as good as the first Iron Man.",6,0,0,29 May 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," Characters Behaved Irrationally
","It was ridiculous how many times the Avengers should've taken out Thanos. When Starkiller punches Thanos when they almost had the glove off, it ruined a lot of the movie for me.There were so many poor decisions the Avengers made that demote this movie. From not destroying the stones while they had them, to seeking out Thanos separately instead of all together, these dumb decisions made this movie unrealistic given the world.It's still one of the better Marvel movies, but it could've been better had the characters behaved more rationally.",7,6,10,5 March 2019
The Lion King," About as good as the original
","Don't listen to the criticism on here. People are blaming the lions for not having facial expressions when that's literally the point of this adaptation....they're lions, not cartoons. The screenplay is the same as the original, so naturally this is an outstanding film. It's very similar to the original with a few new lines in there for humor. The graphics and scenery are both beautiful. The only bad part was BeyoncÃ©'s acting/voiceover. It's well known she's not the best actress. But everyone else was great. Also the songs could've been sang out more instead of talked out.",9,1,5,27 July 2019
