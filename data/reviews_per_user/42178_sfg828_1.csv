United 93," Real Life is Good, Sometimes
","I often hear people say that they go to the movies to escape reality and they've no interest in seeing real life. Do not see this film, then. Paul Greengrass creates the most likely scenario of what actually happened on United 93, September 11, 2001. By using the real life people in the control towers and military personnel, he grounded a fictional representation in the truth. The camera work puts you in the action and there is no politicking. It is so real to life that he even creates mercy for the Muslim hijackers. He doesn't make it better or worse than it was, it just is. I want to thank Greengrass for making this film. It should be considered mandatory viewing for high school students. I appreciate that he waited this long to release it. Even after 5 years, the nerves around 9/11 lay open, raw, and this film provides healing.",10,0,1,17 September 2006
