Mission: Impossible III," A seemingly impossible waste of energy.. A complete lapse of reason
","Mission Impossible:3 was to me an absolutely savage treatment for any awe inspired, thrill seeking movie goer who would like nothing better than to be wowed on a Saturday night at the movies. How Laurence Fishbourne from such amazing flicks as Apocalypse Now and even forgettable ones like King of New York could agree to be totally blindsided in such worthless crap blows my mind. How JJ Abrams who was so believable with Alias, could deliver such mindless agony is the real mission impossible..Cruise needs to disappear for a long long time. The movie tries to submerge you below the 5th grade level. Halfway through the movie you can almost feel the desperation that your life may be running away from you as Cruise is running away in Shanghai. Yes Shanghai, you could almost pin it on JJ Abrams thinking this is Alias the movie instead of MI:3, but how a bunch of caucasion supermen blow up buildings and each other in Shanghai without a single Chinese character having anything to say about it was beyond even the mass Chinese audience in the theater.And never mind all that nasty stuff about the bunny foot in the vase..thats right we got that one!! The editing was hopeless, the acting soul crushing, there was no music, no sex either, no sweeping vistas, the camera shook every second of every action scene such that we completely understood nothing. The movie was boring and witless apart from a couple of phrases by Huffman and Rhames.. Dialogue delivery involved speaking into headsets and cellphones or the robotic chatter of video game consoles. If anything the movie ended abruptly in 2 hours and for that I'm thankful. We didn't really understand anything..We supposedly were in Berlin, Rome, some really long bridge in the states and Shanghai but for all that it mattered it could have been the moon such was the attention paid to detail or a lack thereof..Save your money and go rent any other movie than this one and you may still be able to forgive yourself.",Null,0,2,7 May 2006
