The Avengers," Absolutely Fantastic
",Loved every minute of it. How could you not when it has the genius Joss Whedon behind it. Would love to see him continue with some other Marvel hero movies. He is a great story teller and there was no dull moments at all. Loved the humor in it and all characters bounced off each other extremely well. They were all equal parts instead of having a main character and the others as supporting.Will definitely be buying another ticket to see it next weekend again.Mark Ruffalos Hulk was the best I have seen. Sorry Eric Bana and Edward Norton.Cannot wait for Ironman 3 and then Avengers 2.,10,2,6,6 May 2012
