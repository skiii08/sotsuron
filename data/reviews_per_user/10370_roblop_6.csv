The Mask," this movie is smmoookkkiiinnn
","Now come on!!! This film is absolutely amazing, Jim Carrey steals the show. He really is quite an actor. The way he portrays his character is second to none one of the best examples of comedy genius in todays world. He really is something special and after the truman show, liar liar, dumb and dumber, bruce almighty, lemony snickets a series of unfortunate events, me, myself and irene, ace ventura, ace ventura when nature calls, once bitten, earth girls are easy, man on the moon, pink cadillac and sooo many more we can all come to realise how this one man pertains so much talent. Jim thankyou for everything you have given to the world through laughter. We really do owe a lot to this rubber faced (no pun intended) man with all the talent money cant buy.Thanks",10,0,0,13 July 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," And so the trilogy is over...FOR NOW!!!
","Well well well, what do we have here??? Finally a trilogy in which the climax truly has been spellbinding. The actors (as was expected) were truly stunning and the introduction of Kelsey Grammar as 'Beast' proved successful in so many ways.The story continues smoothly with the help of some great scriptwriting and the characters become very key components of the overall intellectuality of the third installment of the X-Men trilogy.I am going to go out on a limb and state that this was better than its predecessors and is a must see for anyone who evenly remotely enjoyed X-Men 1 and X-Men 2. Well done to everyone involved :-)",10,5,10,25 May 2006
Saw II," A horror film the way they were intended to be!!!
","Firstly let me begin by saying that this was a lot more front on and in your face than Saw ever was. I absolutely loved Saw however Saw 2 really excelled itself.It is always hard to create a sequel that can match or even excel its predecessor but Saw 2 has done just that.I loved everything about this movie, from the acting, to the set direction as well as the script this movie had it all. The best part of it all was the way the writers tied Saw 2 into Saw. They really tied the story lines into each other well and this proved to be the strongest point in the film.Overall Saw 2 is most definitely the horror flick of the year. Nice job boys I give you two thumbs up.Well Done from Down Under",10,1,3,17 November 2005
The Da Vinci Code," An absolutely amazing film, A must see for everyone ! ! !
","After watching The Da Vinci Code I must admit that I truly was impressed simply with the great transition from book to the screen. The actors were top class and the casting truly helped to make this film a top 10 for me.I am however extremely upset by these critics and religious tycoons who state that by seeing this movie you will surely end up in hell and not to believe the lies this film is telling. To you let me say this, The Da Vinci Code IS FICTIONAL. The characters ARE FICTIONAL, the storyline IS FICTIONAL you have nothing to worry about. The Catholic Church wont lose any revenue care of The Da Vinci Code. I wont put any less into the collection plate this Sunday at church. So just back off and let everyone enjoy this film for what it truly is, a great treasure hunt adventure with truly stunning acting and great story that will keep you all on the edge of your seat.A 10/10 in every way.",10,3,6,23 May 2006
Love Actually," If you LOVE love then you'll LOVE love actually
","Let me just start by saying that I expected alot from this movie, with actors like Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Kiera Knightly, Laura Linney, Rowan Atkinson, Bill Nighy, Liam Neeson as well as the one and only Hugh Grant you can't possibly go wrong.The movie lived up to my expectations and exceeded them immensely. From start to finish this (just over two hour movie)amazing movie keeps its audience entertained with non stop laughs, tears and overall enjoyment.I must admit that since 'I am Sam' I have never left a movie feeling as happy as I did with Love Actually. It has a good, positive feeling about it which really is the centre of this masterpiece.The storylines sound confusing but really they are simple to follow and comprehend. 8 different love stories that interwine and end on an amazing climax on Christmas Eve. The actors, the story, the scenery, the overall spectacle of this brilliant film have definately added it to my top 10 list alongside The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.For a feel good, funny, dramatical masterpiece I strongly recommend it to anyone and everyone.A Solid 9/10",10,9,14,14 December 2003
Identity," Identity brings a new meaning to the term 'A Psychological thriller'
","Let me tell you that I will give away nothing about the plot in this review and no spoilers will be included.The movie is really a multi genre film. Thriller, Suspense, Horror but I would definately put it more into the mystery category.The story is hard enough to explain but trust me see the movie and you will not regret it.The acting is perfect, each character is played extremely well by their respective actors, Ray Liotta, John Cusack, Amanda Peet and many others really do make this a top notch movie and one that will keep you guessing right till the final credits.I must also state that this movie involves one of the biggest twists that I have ever seen in a movie since the sixth sense or even the others. The twist is unforgettable and is enough of a reason to go out and see this amazingly written and directed edge-of-your-seat-thriller.Let me finish by saying that I gave this movie a perfect 10, you cant beat it and for a genuine shock and thrill see this one because I know that you will enjoy it.",10,62,84,18 August 2003
