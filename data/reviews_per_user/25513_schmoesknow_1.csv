Source Code," Our Source Code Review- NO SPOILERS
","This was our opinion of the new sci fi thriller, Source Code:We saw the film last night and went in open minded. Honestly, we didn't know what to expect at all. Summit has been putting out some really entertaining stuff lately so there was no reason to shoot down the possibilities of this one being fun. There are similarities to Quantum Leap and that was a big selling point for me. (Leap was one of my favorite shows of all time and I appreciated the nod that they gave it as well.)The Schmoes joined Jake Gyllenhall on his quest to stop a train from exploding in the new thriller 'Source Code'...Would 8 minutes be enough time? What classic television show would this remind our heroes of?? Enjoy!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWPS7mhU5l8",8,0,4,31 March 2011
