The Blair Witch Project," Found Objects in the woods...
","Divine Intervention has been known to visit me every now and once in awhile. Spiritual epiphanies have come about from running away to the local Theater Troupe known as Concept East on what used to be Adams Street. There I realized through reading their books that Black People could represent all the Gods there are just as well as the Greeks and the Romans. I was at home sketching Debra Jo Fondren off the cover of Playboy magazine onto a sheet of Newsprint and found I could draw much better thereafter and with more satisfaction and enjoyment. This was a kind of deliverance to me. Idly dropping off the Livernois bus to visit Doctor Curtis' Museum of Black History while unemployed and having time on my hands, I discovered, much to my astonishment, and contrary to what was to be seen on The Science Channel and 'Through The Wormhole', that Black Folks invented as much new technology and made things better for the future as much as anyone else. Besides that, you could trace their accomplishments back through time thousands upon thousands of years.On top of that, a voice came out of nowhere one day and asked me what my Top Ten Favorite movies of all time were and to list them. I did what the voice bid me to do. At that time the voice asked me what was the common denominator to all these films that I liked so much. This took me a considerable amount of thought before I could formulate a reasonable answer.When the answer dawned upon me, I marveled at my discovery. The films that I treasured the most in my hearts of hearts despite their subject matter all contained the least amount or no Sex and Violence at all in them! I went over the list again and again, thinking this couldn't possibly be the case for such a random selection of films.But, for me, it was true.It was from this that I was able to formulate my hard and fast rule about storytelling.Sex and Violence are substitutes for Character and Plot development.That brings us to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. There is no romantic relationship or love triangle between the female lead Heather Donahue or the other male characters. There are no scenes of physical conflict between any of the leads. Therefore, a very interesting question comes to mind.How could a film made for twentynine thousand dollars plus thirty thousand dollars for promotion costs with no apparent Sex and Violence to embroider its narrative yet go on to gross over a hundred and forty million dollars worldwide? Could it be the focus of the film is on storytelling? This is a great film for Independent Filmmakers to study and treasure. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, according to my lights, is the film that truly and substantially changed the landscape of Cinema. The simplicity of the idea, the method acting techniques used to prepare the actors to improvise their lines and reactions with sophomoric verisimilitude and sincerity in carefully crafted and yet somewhat open ended situations suggests anyone could have made this film.Even you.Sure why not? Anyone could pack their gear and cameras for two or three days of hiking to some place nearby like Seneca Creek State Park to investigate the local Bogeyman legend that's supposed to have happened in the woods somewhere out there. Just take a map and mark your destination so that you don't end up off the beaten track or right back where you started and make a careful record of any suspicious items or objects found on your journey. Hopefully, curiosity won't lead you screaming and running through the woods in the dark fleeing from mysterious sounds in the night. God forbid that all the footage you shoot should end up among the found objects involved with The Blair Witch Legend; that you should end up missing and never heard from again.What a bummer, huh? But it really could happen to anyone.Even you.Sure, why not?",9,1,2,31 January 2014
The Avengers," Fanfare for the Merry Marvel Marching Society!
","Being at one time a young ten year old kid who cut his teeth on 'COWBOY SAM' books and 'JOHN HENRY AND THE DOUBLE-JOINTED STEAM DRILL' as well 'UNCLE ARTHUR'S BEDTIME STORIES', the adventures of the MARVEL UNIVERSE were a welcome introduction into what the older kids were reading and doing. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby somehow as though by divine guidance properly gauged the angst of those teenage years in the Sixties and the zeitgeist of that era. Before the Avengers battled the Space Phantom, I cannot remember when I ever encountered a Superhero like the Hulk. Basically he was a bully in diapers who did not play well with others. After the Avengers at last sent the Space Phantom back into limbo where he belonged, the Hulk related that his feelings were hurt by the remarks others made about him during the heat of battle. He gave the Avengers his walking papers and jumped off into parts unknown.This never would have happened in the JUSTICE LEAGUE.During the showing I attended, after the credits were done, there is a scene where the Avengers are sitting together in a restaurant eating. The expressions on their faces indicate that they would all rather be somewhere else. When I first saw it, it appeared a little non-sequitur and just something added-on to pique interest. But then I went to my Volume 1 of the ESSENTIAL AVENGERS which covers the first twenty four issues of their saga. I decided to use it as a reference for my remarks in this review. When I got to page two of Issue Two, there it was right at the bottom! Essentially the same scene that tagged the end of the Avengers movie. Oh, the setting was different as well as a couple of the characters present or absent, but the theme of the scene was identical to the movie. A bunch of misfits decide to get together and meet regularly in order to increase and better facilitate group cohesion and they can barely stand being in each other's presence! It's the American Experience reductio ad absurdum. It is also the Human Experience should you wish to wax philosophical about it.Reminds me of something I once heard Jesse Jackson declare during a speech and I believe he was quoting Martin Luther King; 'We have to learn to live together no matter how painful, or we'll die apart as fools.' Suffice it to say that for the Avengers working together and living together is particularly painful at times.No, Robert Downey Jr. would not have ordinarily come to mind as Tony Stark AKA IRON MAN, with his yuppie insouciance, but this is a new generation with its own issues and tastes, so there's no use asking '-where have you gone Errol Flynn and Ronald Coleman?'. They're probably having lunch with Joe DiMaggio. Downey, in his own way, does more than represent with IRON MAN.Knowing this genre intimately and well, this time I may be too close to it to effectively evaluate it. There are all kinds of things in this movie that do not fit, but that's the glory of the Marvel Universe. It is a depot for all the things that do not fit that are somehow made to achieve this transcendent irreverent harmony, rhythm and balance. As Edward G. Robinson once said in THE CINCINNATI KID, '-sort of like Life-'.Samuel L. Jackson has no real business being in the AVENGERS doing his usual scenery chewing, channeling bits of 'SHAFT' and 'HAWK' and the Black Man's angst about wanting in on the American Dream. For one thing, the original Nick Fury was a white World War Two hero who headed a squad called Sgt. Fury's Howling Commandos. He would probably be in his nineties by now, but only a time chosen few would know that. Besides, that's the beauty of this fantasy scenario. Nobody really questions what or who these super-powered characters are supposed to be avenging. Actually they're more like the FINAL GUARDIANS than AVENGERS. Anyway, you really would be missing the point pursuing this line of questioning. Here are all these odds and ends of personality and death-defying events and cultural themes somehow welded and soldered together in a kind of collage of imagination and experience and juvenile science fiction and it all works because in the end this ain't your universe. It's the MARVEL UNIVERSE and you're just living and thrilling in it. When you look at it that way, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury gets down and gets back, and redefines the American Dream as something more than that house with the little white picket fence and perhaps simply the divine right to be whatever you want to be.Joss Whedon and Zak Penn finally wised up and decided to stand on the shoulders of giants Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, instead of jumping off to do their own thing with the Marvel Universe. They have written a tale to celebrate. Joss Whedon's direction is Marvelouseque rather than a penetrating interpretation that sometimes hits and sometimes misses as in the case with Sam Rami's SPIDERMAN movies.Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, Tom Huddleston as Loki, Scarlet Johansson as the Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, all have sufficient back stories now either through prior movies or the comics for the audience to be thoroughly prepared for what they might do. They are all so very nearly the characters themselves that all that's left is to be swept up in the action that is truly our satisfaction. And yet, the thing that makes the greatest impact in the end is the characters themselves.Welcome to the Marvel Age of Comics in Cinema!",10,21,38,27 June 2012
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Action Adventure poem...
","Lots of Bogart and Gable in this version of the Saturday matin√©e adventure serial. The action is ratcheted up and for sheer speed of thrills leaves in the dust such worthy contenders as THE PROFESSIONALS with the likes of Burt Lancaster and Woody Strode, and rivals for plot twists and turns such classics as Hitchcock's THE THIRTYNINE STEPS and THE LADY VANISHES. A humorously virile tale that takes its hero through a roller coaster maze of traps and escapes recalling Clyde Beatty and Harry Houdini.There is Harrison Ford giving his Indiana Jones character a professorial panache when he's not outrunning the Hovitos cradling a Golden Idol in his arms. There is Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood channeling a little Patricia Neal and out drinking her barroom patrons before greeting the love of her life with a sock as a way of saying 'Hello'. There is Paul Freeman always on hand to take whatever Indy finds during his archaeological forays as his arch rival Rene' Belloq. Ronald Lacey gives his grinning Nazi Major Arnold Toht enough Peter Lorre to be darkly satisfying in his gruesomeness. John Rhys-Davies as the hearty Arab excavator Sallah helps Jones dig in the right place and rounds out a rich and diverse cast of characters.The pace is as breakneck as the Indianapolis 500 and leaves next to no time to grieve Marion when she's given up for dead in one of a series of teeth chattering death defying explosions. Every time the action clears the air for a little philosophical reflection we are off and running again after something Jones has lost to Nazi enemies or is on the verge of retrieving. Here we see the Fighting Male of the West as a sweaty beleaguered Academic scrambling for relics and artifacts worshiped by primitive cultures in both the East and the fascist West. Lucas provides more mythological motifs than you can shake a Joseph Campbell at, but it's all done with such zest that you barely mind being hit over the head with references to Moses and Odysseus before your breath is taken away.The sweep brings to mind TOO HOT TO HANDLE with Clark Gable and Myrna Loy, but the bump and the grind and the smashing glass and hiss and blood spatter is purely Spielbergian. It is a homage to old Hollywood and a move in the direction to a new Hollywood before you can blink an eye. This is THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE on steroids in a way; a faster paced epic about greed and how things can come to be valued over companionship and human life, but such considerations fly past faster than an arrow or a bullet or a poisoned dart. When it comes to plot pyrotechnics, this film sets the standard for action and adventure to all of the next generation to come.There is some reference to RAIDERS in most of the summer action blockbusters that now appear on the screen. Perhaps only the great Bruce Lee has been more influential with regard to the choreography of the hero adventure tale as you see his moves in everything from the AVENGERS to SHERLOCK HOLMES to THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM to THE MATRIX. But for sheer plot mechanics and acceleration of the narrative many die hard fans will make theirs Spielberg every time.",9,0,0,22 June 2017
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," 'If you listen closely, you can hear Honest Abe laughing!'
","This is a tall tale like the kind I used to tell in Music Class in elementary school. The premise is so off the wall that the onus is on the storyteller to pull the sucker off. This is the kind of story Gordie LaChance, one of the main characters in the movie 'Stand By Me', would reel off to his buddies while they sat around the campfire. The general conversation would somehow drift over to the subject of which was scarier, zombies or vampires, after a learned discussion of girls, sex, and the teachers you hated the most.At this point, the natural storyteller responds as though on cue.'Bet you didn't know Abraham Lincoln was a Vampire Hunter!'This sets off an explosion of laughter and howls of derision.'What? Like that bitch Buffy?''No, he wasn't!''You're crazy, man!'But, of course, this is where the fun begins.I do not at this point want to give you the impression that this movie is somehow a Camp comedy like Mel Brooks' 'The Producers' or 'Young Frankenstein'. Because the truth is it is played straight and not for laughs.That in itself is the wonder of it all.I remember when virtually nobody thought that 'Beetlejuice' guy Michael Keaton could possibly play a caped crusader also known as the Batman. Later on, I shook my head at how wrong I was.This now makes for the second time.I was not going to see this movie. I did not seek this movie out. The premise seemed ridiculous and in bad taste. Why make a joke out of The Great Emancipator like this?Of course it is some kind of pastiche, but I defy you not to be pleasantly surprised as I was by the time the end credits rolled around.Everyone knows how hard it is to establish and maintain a suspension of disbelief for any story; particularly for improbable subject matter. But herein lies the beauty of 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'. I think what happens here is that the Mythology of The Great Emancipator interfaces with the Mythology of The Prince of Darkness and instead of being degraded and debased by this Gothic romance, elevates and lends it dignity! Put another way, the Soul Force of Honest Abe proves to be more powerful than the Mojo of any Undead Bloodsucker.Anyway, that is my theory and I am sticking to it!This mixture of two elements or substances that seem at the outset grossly incompatible proves in actual practice to produce a compound of truth and fiction that is oddly palatable and satisfying. Something like mixing hot sauce with black-eyed peas or eating barbecued flavored potato chips with ice cream. It should not work; it should make you sick to your stomach, and yet for some odd reason as a midnight snack it just hits the spot.This also resolves what Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster once admitted was a long standing argument between themselves as to the purpose and function of Art. The long standing debate between the two friends was should Art primarily teach or should it primarily entertain. Kirk believed that Art's primary function was to entertain and life lessons learned from it were simply icing on the cake. Burt believed the exact opposite. Now I find myself leaning towards and favoring Douglas' point of view. There are many things referenced here and touched upon in passing without being explored in depth and I'll leave it to you to discover what these subjects are. I almost forgot that one of the joys of storytelling is to tell a whopper in such a convincing way that your audience goes along for the sheer thrill of the ride, even as they know full well that this never happened this way and yet if it were to happen like this, doggone, I believe it would be something like the way this is being told.I also believe this explains the appeal of 'Django Unchained', although I believe it is rated too high just as this film is rated too low. I would rate both films a seven and submit that they easily reflect and clarify each other. Plus, you don't have to worry about finding any good white people in either of these films, as was the complaint about Spike Lee's flawed masterpiece 'Malcolm X'. The races unite with heroic 'elan, particularly in 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter', to fight against a universal evil that is sucking the life and soul out of the country. This, despite the wildly improbable context, strikes a meaningful chord of realism.",7,0,1,18 January 2014
Chinatown," A little 'CHINATOWN' will do you...
","Reference Sherlock Holmes about the drawbacks of getting emotionally involved with your clients and the efficacy of police interrogation techniques after watching 'CHINATOWN'...There was this bespectacled, light-skinned little lady I knew in high school. She usually sat in the front of the class at Cass Tech. and kept to herself; never saying much. I have no doubt she collected her 'A's, got her diploma, and matriculated her way out into the real world and her rightful place in the social order. I would have to compare her to Rosa Parks in her demeanor and psychological disposition.Imagine my surprise when I sat down next to her in the back of the Crosstown bus, and on route to our destinations she starts riffing about 'CHINATOWN'! Normally, when I meet strangers, acquaintances, and friends, I dominate the conversation with my rambling free association about my experiences and events, but not so in this case. The young lady communicated to me with an uncharacteristic animation and enthusiasm that I was certain had nothing to do with my personal charm, good looks or winning personality; or perhaps lack thereof. I spent most of our ride listening to her explain in great detail about this wonderful film involving a private eye who puts all the pieces together in a murder mystery and yet still ends up mishandling it all when he gets to Chinatown.When I rang the bell to get off at my stop, I couldn't shake the uncomfortable feeling that this little woman thought this film somehow gave her a kind of special insight into me and my own experience in Life. I was a pretty popular playwright back in high school with an extensive share of performance successes and debacles. All the while we were riding over to the East Side she kept urging me that I should see this film. Being, as I said, a quiet and unassuming person, she did not press the point much beyond that. I shrugged off what she said, and despite telling her that I would have to see the film when I got a chance; it would be years before I actually did see it. But these words she uttered rang through my mind like an unanswered telephone, 'Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.'Finally, the opportunity presented itself at the Helen De Roy Auditorium on the campus of Wayne State University. I went with my sister and a good friend Nick Meyers. We sat in the darkened auditorium and when the film ended, didn't know quite what to say to each other or what to make of it. Nick had to go pick up his girl friend and my sister gave me a ride back into to Highland Park where I was working on a script for her to be aired on educational television.I have said all of the above because I feel a special personal connection to 'CHINATOWN'. It is about many things; but primarily it is about how Money and Politics and the viewpoint of a severely disturbed tycoon affects the quality of relationships and environment in Southern California. That being said, this does not begin to describe the effect that 'CHINATOWN' can have on the viewer. I think these two quotes from the screenplay might better illustrate what I mean:GITTESI'll tell you the unwritten law, you dumb sonof a bitch, you gotta be rich to kill somebody,anybody and get away with it. You think you got that kind of dough, you think you got that kindof class?MULWRAYIn case you've forgotten, gentlemen, over fivehundred lives were lost when the Vander der Lip Dam gave way. Core samples have shown that beneaththis bedrock is shale similar to the permeable shale in the Vander der Lip disaster. It couldn'twithstand that kind of pressure there.(referring to new overleaf)Now you propose yet another dirt banked terminusdam with slopes of two and one half to one, onehundred twelve feet high and a twelve thousand acre water surface. Well, it won't hold. I won't build it.It's that simple. I am not making that kind of mistaketwice. Thank you, gentlemen.There are three films I always felt could have been directed by a Satanist. They are 'THE EXORCIST', 'ROSEMARY'S BABY' and 'CHINATOWN'. Oddly enough, Roman Polanski has directed two of them. This is a comment on the darkness of the subject matter and is not meant as a pejorative statement.Even in the beginning of 'CHINATOWN' one has the feeling that one is experiencing a sick, twisted point of view. Polanski excels at creating this general air of perversity and corruption as an indefinable something you can't quite put your finger on, but which you know is there. The other thing he excels at in this movie is that sustained sense of deja vu'; that growing dread and sense of the impression that '-it's happening again-'; such as I have only felt directing performances of one-act plays, demonstrating defensive tactics in the police academy as a police cadet or having a Zorba-like inspiration about teaching the Grid Technique in the classroom only to have it all fall apart in actual practice and application.'Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.'",10,1,3,30 April 2012
Gravity," Flying Circus in Outer Space
","Gravity has all the flashy appeal of a pop-up book whose pictures you view with 3-D glasses. This is not a bad thing in respect to this film. Outer Space is a marvelous phenomena to experience, and watching Sandra Bullock soar out of the background into the foreground is a wonderful thing to behold. Especially when she is moving through such a vast area of vacuum where orientation to concepts like 'right-left', 'up-down', and 'backwards and forwards' seem profoundly negotiable.The film has a novel feel of authenticity to it, hearkening back and making one recall '2001: A Space Odyssey'. The truth is just seeing Bullock and Clooney explore the dimensions of their craft and using their tools would have probably been enough to sustain interest in this movie. That along with interaction with their fellow crew members once they returned through the airlock. But an attempt was made to give Bullock's character a back story and as such was passable as it did not detract from the suspense, but also did not really add to the storyline.These are probably the two areas where the film falls down. This could have been a film about nothing more than the human interaction of crew members in Outer Space completing routine tasks and missions on the spacecraft they were trained to service. Every now and then revealing more and more of each other's back stories as they cheerfully went along; encountering the stray problem here and there. The setting is so novel it really needed nothing more than this.Recently I read in my studies that people often think of Film as being the bastard cousin of Theater. The actual fact is it is more like the Circus with all its stunts and special effects, visual slight of hand and scenic misdirection. Be that as it may, watching GRAVITY from the very first scene reminded me of going to see 'The Great Wallendas' in Detroit at the State Fair just after that horrible accident they experienced with their impossibly complex High Wire Pyramid Act. There is that same feeling about GRAVITY watching this pair of astronauts do tasks in a highly dangerous environment where the margin for error is razor thin and you are crossing your fingers in your mind that nothing goes amiss.But, of course, something does go amiss, otherwise where would be the story? At least that would be the traditional line of thinking. We watch and when things do go wrong, they go wrong on a scale of Biblical proportions, enough to make you recall DeMille's special effects in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. Whether the orbital mechanics between the objects involved would truly permit such events would require a trained scientist to answer and so I will not venture there. But that it all looks and feels as real as you would imagine it to be I cannot deny.Here the director scores his most telling triumphs. The authentic look and feel of the environment leaves nothing to be desired. The feats of Indian Jones narrow escapes that Bullock and Clooney pull off make you catch your breath as intended to do. The disasters in Outer Space have all the awe and fury of Acts of God and look and feel like the End of the World.The film succeeds so admirably on a technical level you almost forget about things like human values. Who needs human interaction with crew members and character back story with these kinds of incredible things happening in the foreground? The strange feeling I got is that this film could have gone straight into the super technical direction or been about the drama of humans beings involved in mundane tasks servicing their spacecraft. The ride as it is proves still to be thrilling and satisfying, but just like The Great Wallendas this is a balancing act where something gets lost in the shuffle and not all the elements of the story make it to the other side safe and sound.",8,3,4,5 February 2014
Citizen Kane," The Aurora Borealis of Cinema
","Began seeing this film in snippets running in and out of the house between playing baseball in the backyard and heading back down into the basement with Cool-Aid and tuna fish sandwiches to sit on the couch and watch this thing on our black and white T.V. Sooner or later, it would be on the Bill Kennedy show and he would look into his files for newspaper footage about it. The thing that's so wonderful is how accessible this film is for being touted by some as 'the greatest of all time'. Whether or not that is so is more than I know. I've seen and enjoyed a lot of great films. Anything that I might say would barely add or subtract to what has already been said and would probably prove to be redundant at best, so I'll just make a few personal observations and let it go at that.CITIZEN KANE is like a Magic Box filled with all these independent features of interest. Barely coming in under two hours it seems much longer than that and compares favorably with other epics that require an intermission somewhere between its three hours or more length. That's the first thing I have to say about it; the way it seems to dilate time and yet is over before you know it. You don't even have to see the thing from beginning to end to enjoy it. Some years passed before I actually sat down and saw this piece in its entirety. But it didn't seem to matter. There is something ubiquitous about it; it will be there for you when you get the time to fully appreciate it. As a kid, the film noir beginning made me wonder whether or not this was a horror story or some kind of detective tale. As most people know, the truth is it is both and more than that.Agnes Moorehead never looked better in her life! Joseph Cotton along with the rest of the Mercury Theater come on strong in this tale. There are many who will compare this film to THE GODFATHER or VERTIGO and there is probably much to be gained from this, but looking at the film from the inside out you feel yourself having access to one of the most liberal minds of all time. There is a strong spirit of inventiveness here where Welles as the auteur is not adapting his tale to the strictures of Film, but rather adapting the strictures of Film to this vision of grand sweeping storytelling. This to me is what separates it from other great films that it can be compared and discussed with. For most cinematic works, technique is subservient to the story; and yet in CITIZEN KANE it feels as though technique is subservient to the inventiveness of its creator. I'm sure this is true in some Hitchcock films and of course the films of Ingmar Bergman and others, but here that sense of inventiveness is less coldly calculated as it is with Hitchcock at his best, nor is it as somber and steeped in religious and philosophical overtones as it is with Bergman at his most profound. The inventiveness of Welles here is youthful and exuberant and in a naive sort of way distinctly American. Gangway! The young Turks have come to town! Clear the floor for some hoofin' and break out the champagne!I say naive because there is something unselfconscious about this modern classic. Welles is too busy having fun to worry about posterity right now, he'll get back to you later concerning all that. I'll never forget the scene with the dance hall girls. After a bit of cinematic legerdemain where we see Kane buy off the whole staff of a rival newspaper and frame them for a news photograph, we then find his own people joining in to sing his praises. As a youngster the thing that startled me was how long this scene went on; Welles didn't seem to be doing this scene to serve the story particularly, but just for the sheer thrill of dancing with the ladies and having fun! The exhilaration of this scene was something that has stayed with me all my life. Some kind of energy seemed to spiral out of the screen and shake you by the shoulders and urge you to take one spin around yourself. Come on! There's enough booze and food for everyone! It's this scene that makes me wish that Welles had chosen the life of Babe Ruth to chronicle rather than that of William Randolph Hearst.But it doesn't stop there. When you hear Welles present Kane as an orator you are seeing a spellbinder at work; you will see this side of Welles again in MOBY DICK and perhaps more importantly, in the final scenes of the film COMPULSION. This is the energy and passion of a young man at the height of his powers. Kane for President! He'll fight for the common people and win us our rights!Eventually, due to poor choices and a marked propensity to love the power that his wealth brings him more than the people he supposedly wishes to champion, we see Kane progress towards his inevitable slide into tragedy. This is handled with sophistication and taste and we see how Kane becomes an embittered worn out old man living a shallow existence among the shadows of the things that he owns.In the end, we are given a glimpse of insight into the character of Kane that is denied all the other characters in the film. But even that is just an echo of what Everett Sloan as Bernstein tells the reporter Jerry about the girl he saw crossing over on the Ferry. Soon even this is just so much smoke drifting up above the chain link fence and the NO TRESPASSING sign in front of Xanadu...NEWS! ON THE MARCH!",10,3,4,10 July 2016
Catch-22," Paradox in the Air...
","Read the book twice and thoroughly enjoyed it. Saw the movie several times and even got stuck out in the suburbs the first time after seeing it twice and called up my High School Teacher and mentor Pierre Rener to come get me late after midnight hoping to brainstorm with him about it. I'll never forgot how he groaned over the phone, 'Oh God! Oh God!'. I was just a pimply faced teenager back then and only now as an older man do I realize how much I must have irritated the hell out of him.When I read it the first time I loved its wacky wit and snappy ending. Despite its length, for me it wasn't a hard read at all. I suppose nobody had to convince me that war was crazy as it was kind of self evident to me all along and I could kind of sense the comedic appeal of such an activity as a Theater of the Mind. The second time I brainstormed about this royally with Miss Gomez in her class 'INTRODUCTION TO THE NOVEL'. She was a die-hard Existentialist and used Sartre and Camus as a reference for her pontifications which were usually spot on. I can hear her now, '- every assertion implies a negation and every negation implies an assertion.' A beautiful, philosophical woman she was and I learned a lot from her.All this is said to report that I saw only one way to film this thing with its myriad characters and stream of consciousness narrative moving faster than chain-lightning one-liners. I even wrote a paper about it for Miss Gomez's class where I diagrammed how the structure of the novel was very nearly a flashback within a flashback or more formally a series of chain reactions composed as flashbacks. This led Miss Gomez, God Bless her, to declare before the entire class, 'Mister Boykin, you understand this novel better than I do!'Whether true or not, this is one of those stories that, like CHINATOWN, I seem to have a special affinity for because of my temperament and life experience. Paradoxes abound in Life as you surely know and - well, don't get me started about THAT. But the frenetic nature of Yossarian's mental climate as he gradually recovers from the gross traumatic incident that his mind keeps bouncing off because of the pain and horror contained therein is barely addressed or properly served in the film despite a stellar cast.This, however, is the heart and soul of the novel as it should have been with the film. The great humor of CATCH-22 comes from an inability to rationally confront and address the profound pain and horror of the wartime experience. It's this absurd dancing around the contours and the edges of something that's so abysmally hellish that gives the moral comedy of CATCH-22 its edge. Finally around Chapter Thirtynine an exhausted Yossarian realizes the dancing has to stop and he takes a walk through THE ETERNAL CITY to slow down the pace to something bordering on philosophical reflection. But even as he has slowed things down to a walk he observes that the absurdity around him continues on unabated with a will and a spirit of its own. This sense of being reluctantly forced to probe into the philosophical underpinnings of what war really is all about is remarkably absent from the film. It's a great show as was DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, but I always felt some special gravitas was missing despite the able efforts of Alan Arkin displaying all the various shades of moral outrage as Yossarian and Jon Voight offering shares for missing parachutes and chocolate covered cotton balls as 1st. Lt. Milo Minderbinder to keep his corporation afloat.The chocolate covered cotton balls are a great motif, by the way. How do you sell somebody something that nobody wants or needs and is near impossible to digest and besides offering you next to no nutrition doesn't do a damn bit of good for you? I know! We'll cover it with chocolate!The cast reads like a Who's - Who's from Saturday NIGHT LIVE and COMEDY CENTRAL. There is Richard Benjamin as Major Danby, Bob Newhart as Major Major Major, the great Orson Welles as Brigadier General Dreedle and Anthony Perkins as Chaplain Capt. A.T. Tappman. There is also Paula Prentiss as Nurse Duckett and the beautiful body of Olimpia Carlisi as Luciana for aesthetic and romantic diversion. There is even Art Garfunkel attempting to wax philosophical with a wizened old man who has seen this all a number of times before when the warriors came marching into the whorehouse.That being said, I always saw CATCH-22 as a faster paced film than this slow, ponderous elephantine thing Mike Nichols put upon the screen to convey some kind of epic movement and always sensed that the rhythms of CATCH-22 were more akin to Progressive Jazz than any type of reference to Classic Music. Just can't let go of the conviction that I could have penned a better screenplay than Buck Henry in this particular case. Although ALSO SPRACH ZARUTHUSTRA works very well when Luciana comes marching down the street.I also think one of my classmates was right about Omar Sharif. She thought it would have been interesting to see what kind of Yossarian he would have made.",8,0,1,10 July 2016
Malcolm X," Climate of Malcolm X Times
","The life of Malcolm X revolves around two of the most highly charged subjects in American consciousness. Those subjects being Sex and Race. Here in America, the strain of hypocrisy that runs throughout these issues is astonishing and makes objective analysis a formidable and daunting task.People tend to forget that all this started when a journeyman writer working for Playboy magazine landed an interview with this firebrand only then beginning to come into renown. That writer was Alex Haley who, in my opinion, later went on to be for African American History what Homer has become for Greek History. Haley explained to his audiences and me, a cocky and arrogant high school playwright at the time whom he wanted to take down a peg, how hard it was to get Malcolm to open up and speak freely about his life. At the outset, Malcolm presented himself as the proselytizer of the honorable Elijah Muhammud and prefaced many of his statements to Haley with the Spiritual Leader's name. During one of these interviews, Malcolm reminisced about his times as a Lindy Hopper in the dance halls of Harlem and apparently the memory was so vivid he got up out of his seat and started to cut a rug with a few steps. Haley recounted this incident as a breakthrough in the course of the interviews and after that, it was much easier to get Malcolm to talk about his earlier life.This series of interviews became, to a large extent, the basis for THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X, later published by Grove Press. You'll notice in the beginning of Spike Lee's MALCOLM X prominent footage is given to Malcolm X's days as a Lindy Hopper and that this is where the narrative seems to take off. The thing that is interesting to me is how Alex Haley, a paid representative of an organ spearheading the Sexual Revolution, ends up encountering a representative of the Black Cultural Revolution and the phenomena this eventually produces.There is more to the equation than this. Before Spike Lee, writers like myself loved to juxtapose the careers of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King for insights and enlightenment and fascinating parallels can be drawn between these two iconic leaders. In fact, I was surprised that the photograph of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King meeting each other that was so prominently displayed at the end of DO THE RIGHT THING didn't find its way underneath the flaming flag at the beginning of MALCOLM X. What is of interest here is how these two extraordinary individuals appeared poles apart on the issue of how to defend self determination or achieve greater human freedom and yet end up as martyrs for the cause. The theme of nation building which Elijah Muhammud was espousing on a rudimentary basis is to be found within the nexus of their relationship.Spike Lee tells the story of MALCOLM X with a sweep and a verve and a heartfelt vitality and wit. You can sense how much he loves his subject when, as playing Shorty, he asks Malcolm played by Denzel Washington, whether or not he really put a loaded pistol to his head playing Russian roulette or palmed the bullets beforehand. It is like a question he always really wanted to ask this figure and now finally gets a chance to do so in his film. This scene reeks of hero worship and yet is oddly endearing.I also would have liked to have seen an ending something like that of Hype Williams' film BELLY grafted onto the end of MALCOLM X suggesting that the time was well nigh for black men to stopping killing black men under any pretext. This, and a moment of silence, as the film faded to black with Nina Simone singing 'TO BE YOUNG, GIFTED AND BLACK' to better discharge the process of catharsis. I would have preferred this to Lee's homage to SPARTACUS with school kids chanting 'I AM MALCOLM X!'.That being said, the process of how MALCOLM X came to be made is almost as adventuresome as the life of Malcolm X himself. It is amazing how many talented people came together within the artistic community to make this particular phenomenon happen. The ensemble achieves true synergy more often than not and the chemistry between characters on all levels is real and palpable. MALCOLM X comes across as a great show despite the fact that Lee succumbs to the temptation to make white folks the Indians and black folks the Cowboys and a beautiful white woman ends up kissing a black man's dirty foot.",8,2,5,6 February 2014
The Best Years of Our Lives," World War II Redeemption...
","I must have seen this film ten times on the Bill Kennedy Show while growing up. Sometimes in snippets and often times all the way through. I have seen it over a half a dozen times on Turner Classic Movies. I remember seeing it in my high school English Literature text book. The only screenplay I ever saw in a book about serious literature. Now I finally have a DVD copy of it for my personal collection. I still can't believe it runs nearly three hours. It just never seemed that long.Strange how time is affected when you become involved in a story. CITIZEN KANE always seems longer than it really is; nearly three hours and yet it barely comes in under two hours. THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES is the exact opposite. It seems like it comes in under two hours, but runs nearly three.Go figure.This is an entirely character driven story that doesn't depend on sex and violence to carry the narrative. It could have easily degenerated into soap opera, but somehow never does. The chemistry between the three male leads; Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Fredric March as Al Stephenson is largely responsible for this. But this is still one of the greatest examples of ensemble acting in cinema because it all seems so ordinary and everyday and effortlessly true to life.The women are also a revelation. Myrna Loy as March's wife Milly Stephenson hits all the right notes as the beleaguered wife, Teresa Wright shines as their bewildered daughter, unwillingly caught in a love triangle between Fred Derry and his wife, Marie, memorably portrayed by Virginia Mayo. Cathy O'Donnell is achingly poignant as Homer Parrish's girl friend Wilma Cameron, sympathetically standin' by her man with no hands.Russell won two Oscars for his moving portrayal as Homer Parrish and I have never been more reluctant to write a spoiler. This time I'll just advise you to see for yourself what his performance is all about. Dana Andrews as Fred Derry gives one of the best interior monologues you will ever see in film and hungover Fredric March waxes eloquent about the rights of the returning veteran.Here is a great place to start dissecting that complex of relationships that make for absorbing drama. There is nothing forced or histrionic about this film. The ending I found resoundingly fitting as everything fell into place. You should easily be able to relate the experiences of your own life to what you see on the screen. Even so, this 'life as it is' version of service men returning home from war will register stirring, vivid images in your mind that will stay with you for the rest of your life.",10,4,5,25 June 2017
Ant-Man," Go to the ant, thou sluggard...
","I know Ant-Man well. I remember when he first started out in the comic book TALES TO ASTONISH, before he began popping pills to alternate between being Ant-Man and Giant Man. Much like Iron Man, Ant Man was a comic book hero not quite popular enough to merit manning an entire comic book by himself. He would share TALES TO ASTONISH with other super heroes who would come and go.The surprise is how well Iron Man and Ant-Man lend themselves to cinema. Iron Man is a perfect representative of the digital age which may yet indeed foster upon us mechanical men of all kinds and sizes. Iron Man lends himself to interesting CGI effects much more easily than almost any of the other characters with the exception of Thor and the realm of Asgard.Ant-Man is another matter entirely. An original member of the Avengers primarily as Giant Man, it was hard for me to imagine viable directions for his character to go. When the Hulk left the Avengers and later fought them to a standstill along with the Fantastic Four, it was Ant-Man and his squadrons of ants who put a stop to all the mayhem and carnage once and for all. It was admittedly a novel twist, how the smallest and supposedly least significant of creatures could stop a thundering behemoth who was the strongest thing walking the Earth; i.e., The Incredible Hulk.This film improves upon the Ant-Man myth in a number of ways. First of all, this film has the look and feel of the original comic book sans all that 'dark edge' stuff that is really designed to satisfy the sensibilities of adults who have hijacked the Comic Book medium for their own needs and agendas. This movie is an Action Comedy and feels and acts more kid friendly. Michael Douglas lends the gravitas of a great actor to the role of Hank Pym, who as the original Ant-Man becomes the mentor to the Ant-Man to be, Scott Lang, as played by Paul Rudd. Scott is no esteemed scientist, but rather a high-tech computer thief recently released from San Quentin. Therefore we have the High and the Low at work in this current adventure story.While Ant-Man goes through all his shrinking and enlarging, the plot itself goes through convolutions and permutations on smaller and larger scales and gives a subtle nod to an earlier film called THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN. I found the homage to this film, as lighthearted as it was, something that gave this ANT-MAN just that extra layer of awe and wonder making Scott Lang's Hero's Journey much more evocative in its sophistication. Baby boomers like myself could feel included in the reach of its appeal, even as ANT-MAN began its mission of putting the COMIC back in the term Comic Book Superhero. As in, this is for kids and adults...That doesn't mean ANT-MAN comes across as camp particularly. It is a snappy, fast-paced adventure reminiscent of BACK TO THE FUTURE and whizzes in and out of the realms of relativistic physics and quantum mechanics with a knowing verve and assurance that gasps and chuckles at itself. The cinematographer Russell Carpenter is to be commended for the look and the feel of the piece as is the veritable army of an Art Department that gave this film its allure. The quips and wise-cracking in the face of danger are all back and this Ant-Man is all that a Marvel Superhero should be. Corey Stoll as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket proves a particularly compelling multi-layered villain. Evangeline Lily is also attractive and exciting as the estranged daughter of Henry Pym, Hope Van Dyne, while Michael Pena and his boys bring up the rear and do street with the comic relief. So the cinema is proving to be a medium that can grant new life and viable evolution to even the most diminutive of heroes, just like it proved to be for one Dark Knight.",8,0,1,29 May 2016
Predator," 'Ten Little Indians' in the Jungle!
","This film is to me a guilty pleasure for all time. It is a classic so well camouflaged in a mix of genres, i.e., War Movie, Sci-Fi, Horror, Murder Mystery, to name a few, that it doesn't even know its a classic! This even grants the film a certain amount of humility concerning its intentions. It is an action flick with the apparent gravitas of a Sgt. Rock comic book, that upon repeated viewings inspires some truly deep thinking. It's the little action adventure movie that didn't think it could and didn't even bother trying to do anything beyond entertaining its audience that somehow lumbers beyond the limitations of genre expectations to serve up food for thought as well as grist for the gore mill. It is a film I could have easily seen Joe Kubert or Jack Kirby doing the storyboards for that is peopled with musclemen who blindly wrestle their way into an end zone of unexpected deliverance. 'Predator' rocks with enough visceral thrills for any 'action junkie' and yet is deeply satisfying intellectually in this gruff, offhand Hemingwayesque way. It made me nod with the slowly dawning realization of having finished a well-sanded project in wood shop.'Predator' is an essay on machoism in all its most laudable and cartoonish aspects and that is what makes it such satisfying storytelling. The very beginning of the movie looks like a few seconds of some unknown Sci-Fi flick spliced onto the beginning of a standard Vietnam War movie dedicated to exploits of martial valor. It almost feels like a glitch in editing, as though somebody grabbed the wrong reel. Arnold Schwarzenegger swaggers out of a landed helicopter chomping a cigar backed by a team of ace commandos. You expect Chuck Norris to arrive at any moment. He meets with Carl Weathers, also chomping a cigar, and after some playful arm wrestling as a way of saying 'Hello', then gets down to being briefed about the mission at hand.Schwarzenegger eventually finds out that Weathers has him employing his team and combat tactics under false pretenses and that the mission has different objectives from those stated by Weathers. What Weathers doesn't know is that his 'mission' is about to be preempted for the sporting pleasure of a visitor from another world. After that, it's the hunt and the chase and the fight against an unseen adversary who at times seems everywhere and yet nowhere. The beauty of this film is watching the macho postures of the various lead characters slowly deconstruct and dissolve into expressions of alarm and dread or simply screams of terror and agony when it's their turn to have their ticket punched.When Schwarzenegger finally gets some idea of what's killing off his team one member at a time, he becomes an archetypal hero that Natty Bumpo or James Fenimore Cooper would be proud to welcome into the fold. This is the film 'Conan the Barbarian' should have been, but never could be. It is about the past, present and future of manly virtue or machismo, but only as a disturbing afterthought.",9,0,2,26 December 2012
Watchmen," An Elegy to Comic Book Mythology
","THE WATCHMEN presses all the most hallowed cultural buttons with its imagery, and even takes some of the charge off having to grow up in the optimistic sixties only to be gradually disillusioned from there on out. It is brutal and violent in a way that the Comics Code would never approve of, but it leaves no doubt that it is about the death of heroes and perhaps even the deconstruction of Modern Western Mythology. These are heavy, adult themes for a medium ostensibly advertising itself from its very beginnings as being primarily for the amusement of children. You could easily say the adults have hijacked the Comic Book medium for the sole expression of their own angst and concerns and you would not be far from right.I leafed through the graphic novel by Dan Gibbons and Alan Moore, but I am afraid that the aesthetics of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee have probably prejudiced me in my view of other Comic Book universes. I found the novel dense and difficult to get through and not visually stimulating enough to compel me to make the effort. My intuitive understanding of the Comic Book medium is that the visual is the primary emotional carrier wave and the written text serves to underline and give a thought context to the action being presented. I always thought of Comic Books as storytelling on the cheap; something that was highly derivative and unashamed to borrow heavily from other mediums like film and television. But this was alright, because in it's derivative thinking it was gently pointing to deeper experiences of its subject matter once you were more mature and adult. I fondly remember the trauma of reading 'The Death of Superman' in the comic book and then discovering years later that the ending came pictorially from a movie with William Holden and Jennifer Jones entitled 'Love is a Many Splendored Thing'! Zack Snyder's film version of THE WATCHMEN is satisfying to me because it makes this constant reference between the surfaces that the medium so successfully explores, and also exploits in many cases, and the darker objectives that often manipulate the display of these surfaces for mass consumption and indoctrination. Nowhere is it written that the employment of words and images must serve the aims of Manifest Destiny or cultural domination or be used to launder the dirty activities of covert operations, but in the universe of THE WATCHMEN this is implied from the first frame onward. The heroism of THE WATCHMEN is flawed and corrupt from the outset and is shown to accrue a force that eventually eats away at itself. This is not your father's Superhero Team, and we come to find out eventually that even they were not all they were cracked up to be.I liked the ending merely because it makes the subtle suggestion that the truth is not to be found ultimately in the physical forces of this world, but in the voice that resides on the printed page and refuses to be stilled.This is still a clich√©' that I find palatable and amusing when freshly presented.",9,1,3,4 February 2014
Avengers: Endgame," Rewards for the Faithful
","I have scrolled through the reviews for this movie and been gently and mildly amused at how opinions about this film yo-yo much the same as this cinematic presentation. I could detail a whole laundry list of things I enjoyed about this movie, but I have observed that other reviewers have done this extensively and so I want to concentrate on personal impressions at this time. Later on, we can talk about scientific howlers concerning Time Travel and relativistic physics and quantum mechanics.First of all, I am a member of the group who grew up with and lived through the Marvel Age of Comics. I fully understand and remember vividly how this all started and now where it has finally arrived. I understand with absolute clarity and certainty how Darth Vader is actually an extrapolation of Doctor Doom and in the end a recapitulation of his origin story. This being true no matter what George Lucas says about the benefits he derived from his mentor Joe Campbell, which is also evidently beyond dispute.I remember idly considering while collecting DC comics how I wished there was a style of comic book writing and illustration that was more dramatic, structured around greater conflict and a bit more virile and witty. That was when I discovered Marvel Comics. I felt like life was giving me what I was dreaming about. Following the chronology and evolution of the Marvel Experience has simply affirmed and strengthened my conviction that what you imagine can actually come true.AVENGERS: ENDGAME is everything a bunch of scrappy ghetto kids cracked wise about and exulted over between games of lob baseball. This while hearing some neighborhood child from across the street tell us that our mother just said we should come home now that it was getting dark. We who started out with this experience are simply amazed and delighted with how far and wide this phenomena has expanded. We remember the cheesy fan buttons and the little red vinyl records for the Merry Marvel Marching Society and Stan's Soapbox. I remember how, reading about Doctor Strange and his redemption from his own arrogance, as well as Prince Namor: The Submariner finding his way back to his long lost Kingdom, helped fuel and catalyze my own desire to be a writer. I also remember the Pandora's Box I opened up when I first assayed to learn How To Draw Comics The Marvel Way. Through it all, Stan Lee kept promoting and building with others what is now a vast public relations machine and went on to the Great Beyond having conferred to us a profound legacy in Literature and Art along with Jack Kirby and an immense cadre of other artists and writers.I finally can say this while now in my advanced age; being willing to admit after taking Ann Wilkinson's class in Child Literature at Wayne State University that almost any good children's book is usually superior in thematic content to your average comic book. The fact that I can now say this without anyone having to wrestle me to the floor, strikes me as a major turning point in my own maturation.I watched AVENGERS: ENDGAME and felt a significant chapter of my life coming successfully to a close. The baroque ranging in Time and Space between screams and witty asides was everything I dreamed the Marvel experience could be in my youth and then some. Even the speculation of Captain America about what life would be like simply married to Sharon Carter as an ordinary Joe seemed oddly fitting in this wacky universe where anything can happen and you can hear the Mighty Thor burping over his beer belly from too much ale.I also found myself reflecting on Rob Bryanton and his ideas in IMAGINING THE TENTH DIMENSION: A NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT TIME AND SPACE as I was watching this movie. This is the spirit of the best of Juvenile Science Fiction. That it lightly touches on ideas and themes that can be explored more deeply later in a salutary way and lead to greater growth and development.When we came to the rousing finale, I felt that my conviction that life can be what you imagine it to be was finally successfully rewarded and my faith in this belief irrefutably validated.The Marvel Universe has landed, and so can yours, too.Deal with it.",10,0,5,18 May 2019
The Commitments," Where being 'Black and Proud' can take you!
","I think anyone who has ever attempted to organize and direct a group to achieve success in any artistic activity can appreciate this film.The thing I found heart-warming about this story was how a group of white teenagers from Dublin seize upon the idea to study 'Black Soul Music' as their route out of the Irish Ghetto and as a ticket to success. The notion is actually the brainchild of Jimmy Rabbitte, and having directed plays in High School and straight out of Community College, I could easily identify with what he was trying to do. He forms this motley crew of singers and musicians; some of whom can barely stand each other, all of whom can't stand the lead singer Deco Cuffe.Most stories on film will find Blacks emulating the successful actions of White people in order to achieve success in life. Sometimes they would take this too far and to their chagrin receive the censure of their peers for 'trying to act White'. This film was refreshing because you saw white kids intently studying James Brown and Otis Redding and others in order to analyze the dynamics of what makes Soul Music work. All the while with Jimmy Rabbitte exhorting them to '-say it once and say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud!'Quite a stretch for teenagers in Dublin and just when you think they've got it down and the flywheel is finally connected to the engine of their emotions and transmitting force; well, you'll see what I mean. I really enjoyed seeing them practice their lyrics while ironing clothes or practicing their moves while hanging the wash on the line. It reminded me of what it is like for working class people to struggle and claw their way up on the path towards a dream. Many of the claustrophobic interior scenes reminded me of places where I visited friends in the Projects and quite frankly, it was a revelation to me that there were White People who lived in Ghetto conditions too. This gave credence to the tagline, 'They started out with nothing, and were ready to risk it all!'. It also explains why they were even ready to grasp at the straw of 'Soul Music' for a leg up if they could get it. This is the burning desire of the poor person to raise him or herself up by any means and comes across as a universal aspiration.There is also this air of youth blooming into adulthood not quite certain what is out there for them, but ready to explore and try anything. This is the spirit that is the salvation of the Human Race and says, '-let me try this viewpoint on for awhile and see what its value is for me and what I can take from it to create a personal life expression.' Between Jimmy Rabbitte's pep talks and his father declaring that Elvis is God and two of the female backup singers berating sexy Imelda Quirke for 'prick-teasing' and Joey 'The Lips' Fagan shagging one of the ladies to Barry White or Isaac Hayes, we're happy to be their running buddies as they stroll the streets and alight from the buses of Dublin into their own version of Soul Music.I found that moment when it seems as though they have risen above the limitations of conflicting personalities and environmental pressures especially elegiac and poignant. There is that moment in the life of many a youth where it seems as though they have grasped the whole world and taken a glimpse of what is possible for them. There is that moment in this film. What was exciting was to see what each of the characters took as a Life Lesson from this particular adventure into Soul Music once the smoke cleared and the dust settled.When Jimmy Rabbitte speaks to the interviewer from the future about his inevitable success while in the bathtub or while washing his hands and looking into the Restroom mirror, I was reminded of my own attempts to sign on the dotted line the contract with myself for triumph.'The Commitments' is a great way to find out what it all means.",7,2,4,16 January 2013
Django Unchained," Freedom flows from the barrel of a gun...
","'Django Unchained' is an unusually literate outing at the movies based on sound storytelling and carefully cultivated and reticulated narrative pace. It lacks the warmhearted authenticity of the friendship between Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte in 'Buck and the Preacher' and has slightly less of the macho swagger of Mario Van Peebles' 'Posse'. But that notwithstanding, it does have something these two noted films lack.That is a good white person. The kind of good white person whose absence was so conspicuous in Spike Lee's 'Malcolm X'.The lead character Django meets a bounty hunter of dubious values who yet and still as a character is slightly more developed and intriguing than even Django himself. He mentors and guides Django in the art of killing for money and once Django acquires the requisite skills, Freedom beckons on the horizon like bright sunshine. Together they cook up a plan to rescue Django's wife from the evil castle in Candyland.So far so good.Earlier, I mentioned how it might be enlightening to compare this film with 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'. I still consider this a valid and valuable suggestion. Slavery is such an emotionally charged subject that it is easy to forget that many countless whites have advocated, agitated and even gone as far as to sacrifice their own well-being and even lives for the liberation of those kidnapped from Africa. For, commercial purposes, it is much easier to label whites as the bad guys and blacks as the good guys and play upon the latent resentments and anger of an audience that has been used to viewing itself in less than flattering and often downright demeaning ways.This film, to its credit, does not do that. It's characters are as complex as those in the original Western '3:10 to Yuma'. Unfortunately, with the exception of Broomhilda, Django's wife, they are not as sympathetic.The characters in 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' are sympathetic. Nobody could ever represent poor, redneck, hillbilly white trash better than the homely rail-splitter from Illinois and Kentucky who somehow pulled himself up by his bootstraps reading Euclid and Law books in the fields and the General store until, for whatever reasons, he finally gave his life to end slavery and preserve the Union. When you see Mary Lincoln hiking with Harriet Tubman and runaway slaves to some destination in the North, it rings emotionally true even though it probably never happened that way.'Django Unchained' has wit and intelligence; not to mention the usual uninhibited Tarantino abandon for ladling out the blood and guts a little too thick. While not exactly my cup of tea, (or should I say hot tomato soup?), it is easy to see how Tarantino has won the love of his legions of fans. But I have to admit I find his use of violence, bordering as it tends to on the pornographic, off-putting at times.",7,1,4,28 January 2014
Patton," Last Hurrah for the Fighting Male of the West
","Just saw 'Patton' with George C. Scott for Veteran's Day and thought I would comment on it while it's still a fire in my mind.Francis Ford Coppola wrote a very enlightened screenplay that thoughtfully explores the Western Male Ethos and its accruing limitations as it plays its 'civilizing influence' out across the millennia. But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing, not one little thing without the towering Shakespearean quality performance of George C. Scott. When actors speak about shadings, depths and levels, undertones and overtones in a performance this is what they are talking about.This thing of beauty that Scott creates in the persona of General Patton will explain to you on a visceral level why we still have wars and why Cronus ate his children. Why Knute Rockne felt it necessary to explain the need of any society to sublimate somehow the natural male spirit and propensity for combat and, (dare I say it?) conquest in their relationships and surroundings. When wide-eyed innocents ask you '-why is there War?', don't explain anything to them. Just sit them down to watch this film and they will also understand why there is football and the deification of Bruce Lee.It is because of this guy; the 'pure warrior' strutting about over a vast playing field creating big Hollywood effects in blood and explosions and steeling himself against the human carnage he has wrought without hardly breaking stride.It is for the glamor and the glory and the thrill and the love of POWER, baby. THAT is why males engage in such a 'preposterous way to settle a dispute' as Sherlock Holmes would comment registering his disgust while twiddling his thumbs and awaiting a 'case' that will once again have him engaged in the hunt and the chase and the fight.Scott conveys through his performance a mythic archetype who somehow takes you grudgingly into his confidence and despite all his carefully orchestrated bombast gets you to know him in subtle and intimate ways. He knows, like Alan Ladd's 'Shane', that his days are numbered. There have been way too many women and children marched naked in the parade before the conqueror's stand for him to be put up with much longer and the clamor for him to march his own way back into the dim mists of history is rising to a deafening pitch. But before he goes, he just wants to hitch up his ivory plated pistols one last time, partners, and show you turkeys how a real warmonger gets it done. That is because he honors and reveres and loves all this with a fervor approaching religious ecstasy and in a way you never will. As James Brown would exclaim, 'Everybody relax; and watch me work!' The wonder is how Scott manages to simultaneously convey General George Patton as a larger than life figure and yet as someone as real and down to Earth as that son of a bitch who keeps complaining about how your kids are always running across his lawn and what he'll do to them the next time. Seeing him in scenes with the other actors he stands out not because of the usual physical beauty of the standard leading man, but because he seems so out of place. He is indeed a walking human anachronism. This is World War II and the American Armed Forces have enough intelligence, grit, technology and will to win it. But just in case events don't go their way, they have brought Solomon Grundy back from the grave to reserve as their Ace in the hole.Karl Malden and supporting cast come across as temperate paragons of sanity next to Scott's fiery Patton. Even the Nazi officers seem like civil servants simply doing their job, as was their assertion when defending the Jewish holocaust. This film, to Scott's credit, seems all about Patton and the holy and unholy forces he has unleashed to make everybody head for the hills before all the evidence is burned and he is finally reigned in for good. Everybody else is fighting for Home and Country, but Scott's Patton is the Spirit of War plying them to accept his Faustian bargain. Thank God nobody takes him up on it.There are many other things to be said about this film. It is like encountering a beautiful woman in the Library. Later on, you try to convince yourself she wasn't all that, but upon encountering her again you realize she WAS all that and there were even more features to her beauty that only now you can appreciate.This is not 'The Best Years of Our Lives'. But should you like films that make you feel like you're part of a winning gang earning the approval of an ornery father by doing the impossible and whose portrait oddly resembles that of the dearly departed Dorian Gray, I can only recommend this poetry spouting reincarnation of the Force of War.However, when taking your girl on a date, and having a choice between seeing 'Love Story' or 'Patton', I suggest you see 'Love Story' first.",10,1,2,12 November 2014
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," O where for art thou Galactus?
","The career of Stan Lee, like that of Muhammud Ali, are two things I can proudly say I was there at the beginning to experience. Amusing to see Will Smith in rightful blatant hero worship of the man as his film 'ALI' premiered, mugging with him in photo shoots. But I remember when he started out as Cassius Clay, a loudmouth braggart everybody was just chomping at the bit to see get his comeuppance one day. I can hear my father chuckling as he glanced at me from his copy of the DETROIT FREE PRESS, 'Now you gonna see what happens when you brag too much...' This just before the first Liston fight...And what award did Stan Lee win to distinguish 'THE FANTASTIC FOUR' as 'The World's Greatest Comic Magazine'? He was about to quit the Comic Book Industry when his wife advised him to go out 'doing his own thing' and now here we are in the Twentyfirst Century commenting on the latest incarnation of 'THE FANTASTIC FOUR'. Blessed with a flair for hype and self promotion (remind you of anyone who floated like a butterfly?) and the visionary prowess of the great Jack Kirby the truth of the Marvel Universe is still marching on.What a bunch of street kids saw in mighty Marvel in between lob ball and lemonade on hot summer days racing across the grit and gravel of the Hutchinson Elementary School playground, the world would finally come to appreciate after about a fifty year communication lag. The gang fights and the rumbles with the Incredible Hulk about '-who da MAN?-' and Peter Parker trying to make an honest buck out of a spider's bite while Doctor Strange was finding out that the skill the Good Lord giveth he can just as well take away AND your penthouse too; now the rest of the world is finally getting with the program. But awww- you're all just johnny-come-latelies, so why don't you just sit down before you hurt yourselves?After all, it took the College kids ten to fifteen years before they could appreciate that they were walking around with the pulp fiction equivalent of storyboards detailing the wonders of the universe in their pockets that could not be filmed because CGI wasn't even out of its diapers yet. Meanwhile, Captain America was waking up out of a natural cryogenic sleep compliments of World War II and the Submariner as Doctor Doom planned to take over as landlord of the Baxter Building and send the Fantastic Four into outer space before their lease was up! Now the film industry is finally gearing up and starting to track with the groundwork already laid out in the Marvel Age of Comics and in many cases before present company was even born. Some are grousing that the present incarnation of the Marvel Superheroes does not measure up to original times and they have no idea how right they are. But I remember when The Amazing Spiderman had acne and flatfeet and looked like the fellow who got sand kicked in his face before Charles Atlas promised him he could be 'BIG'! I remember when there were ink spots over the pictures and the Beast walked out on the X-MEN because he was sick up to here with all the training to protect ungrateful Earthmen and left the Cyclops standing by the window looking out after him stomping away to hit the road.How right you are that the present Reed Richards doesn't look anything like Burt Lancaster whom he was originally modeled after, nor does Ben Grimm favor Jack Dempsey when he's not doing The Thing trip. Nor does Sue Storm look like the beauty queen from 'TARZAN'S GREATEST ADVENTURE', but she'll do in her own way. I would love to see what a young Michael Landon might do with the Johnny Storm character, but of course, those days are long gone.At least the Silver Surfer looks decent and moves and acts the way most everybody imagined him, but in the Marvel Age of Comics Sue Storm would have croaked in Reed Richards' arms and the real Galactus would have come stepping out of his cloud to debate with The Watcher how come Earth should not be on the menu. Everything would have faded to black just like when the Dread Dormammu sent Doctor Strange slippin' into darkness to disappear into nothing but the black ink of the last panel. There would have been a real 'THE WRATH OF KHAN' moment then, and when it came to the third installment of 'THE FANTASTIC FOUR', you would not have to say '-y'all come back now, hear?-'But guess what? This is exactly how the Marvel Age of Comics started in the sixties! Standing on shaky ground, a little anxious and unsure of itself while aliens invaded the bodies of Earth's adolescents, doing their research and drawing their plans until the age of nineteen when such members finally come of age.And it really is a gas to see the Marvel Universe finally come of age here in the Twentyfirst Century where it belongs after all its growing pains! Cudos to Tim Story and cast and crew for taking these super heroes into their latest and so far greatest evolution! Excelsior! The best is yet to come!",7,1,2,9 March 2012
Pi," Pi in the Sky
","Really enjoyed this movie because it was an intellectual thriller and quest story. Thought the music was viscerally appropriate and the herky-jerky pace riveting. No, I cannot say this movie inspired me to more thoroughly peruse my copy of 'Mathematics and the Imagination', but I can't remember when a movie ever inspired me to read a book, albeit it has often been the other way around. However, I could appreciate that this was a cautionary tale about what happens when you seek the answer to everything all by your lonesome.Max Cohen is a driven paranoiac blessed with computational altitude that he uses to impress the little Chinese girl in the Park. Naturally, you see the stereotypes at work; Jewish people and Orientals are naturally presumed to be really smart. But somehow I didn't mind. I could go with it, because I know Jewish people and Orientals who are really smart.The obsessive and compulsive nature of the narrative gets under your skin and gets you going with the protagonist. He's devoting all his time to discovering something truly important, but one gets the feeling he may end up staring at the Sun too long again with injurious consequences. The allusion to Icarus is something of a foreshadowing about what is to come.You could say Max's closest companion is his supercomputer Euclid which he built himself. He'll have nothing to do with the girl next door in his apartment building named Devi. After all, what could she offer him and his work except the care and the concern that would help relieve his migraine headaches and keep him from cracking up. Sol, the friend and mentor whom he visits from time to time, keeps trying to tell him that there's more to life than mathematics. You would think that some one with his intelligence might grasp the possibility of this simple fact. But you know what happens when you find out you're really good at something. It becomes your whole world even when it's not THE world.Max's hard work leads to his computer crashing and ejaculating before it does an odd string of numbers 216 digits long. Somehow it becomes apparent that this number might be the mathematical name for God. Once Max has this number in his head it seems to him that everybody is after him, from Hasidic Jews and Rabbis ready to prep mankind for the Messianic Age to secret agents like Marcy Dawson from Wall Street seeking to use his new found knowledge for their own ends.The thing that was fascinating was how Max appeared to be in a race against his own worsening pain. This occurring still despite his much sought after breakthrough and epiphany concerning numbers as the underlying nature of everything. More than once I thought he was really attempting to find a mathematical solution to resolve the periodic and inevitable onslaught of his own agony. It looked and felt like God was punishing him for attempting to know things without adequate preparation.I loved when his mentor Sol shared with him the anecdote about Archimedes and how his wife made him take a bath and this led to the breakthrough that made him run naked through the streets shouting 'Eureka!'. It's one of the interesting themes of this fascinating noir film. The idea that Cosmic Intelligence is not for the cloistered few but is an inclusive function and faculty of all mankind. Lone wolves plumb and probe its depths at their own risk and may be consumed by it when it becomes too late.",8,0,1,12 December 2014
Ip Man," A Martial Arts Master becomes a Teacher and Upholds the Dignity of his Culture...
","Here in the States, as in many other places, if you have knowledge that enables you to hurt someone efficiently while you yourself remain relatively unharmed, you are considered someone who really knows something. Compared with growing crops or domesticating animals for the dinner table, or designing clothes or building appropriate shelters that can withstand the challenge of the elements, the ability to hurt or maim others seems to have dubious value. However, there have been cases in History where this ability has come in handy against mad dogs, wild animals and the crazed in their campaign to victimize others.Truth be told, fighting for its own sake has always bored me, as there are other subjects and activities that more easily bring joy to the user and even generate experiences and products that others can easily enjoy. Hunting I understand, as you have to have something to eat, and self preservation against armed interlopers needs no explanation. Contest is built into the warp and woof of this universe, and I once read somewhere that Life is essentially a war between spirit and matter. A sobering thought that few would take umbrage with.The reason I like 'IP MAN' so much is because I feel it is a more accurate reflection of the true oriental mind. The exposition of the film has an almost Edenic quality to it as a martial arts master comes to visit another. Ip Man receives his guest with warm courtesy and civility. He offers his guest tea and something to eat even though it is obvious that his visitor has come to test his martial arts skills against him and would like to get on with it. There is no anger or rancor in either man. The visitor finds the tea quite good and nods to Ip Man's wife when he is offered a sweet. I believe Ip Man's son darts in and out from time to time. At this point, Ip Man and his friend are like two college professors enjoying each other's company. Outside a kite is floating in the breeze until it eventually gets caught in a tree.When the light repast is finished, the chairs are removed to the far sides of the room and the masters bow to each other. The time has come to compare techniques and review their understanding. The sparring lasts for a few minutes and the masters are careful not to break the furniture. It is obvious at this point that Ip Man holds the ascendancy, but at no point do we feel he is out to take the other man's dignity. When the sparring is done, both cheerfully bow and the visiting master exclaims that he has learned a lot. One has the impression that he will hasten to take what he has learned and share it with his students as he runs his own school.So much for the visiting martial arts master seeking counsel from a recognized expert. While they were sparring, a young man climbed into the tree to get his kite back and witnessed the entire affair. He can't wait to run back and tell his friends how Ip Man 'wiped the floor' with their master!This beginning scene hooked me on the movie. The idea that there could be a civilization where people could share ideas and knowledge without inferring 'superior' or 'inferior' status in a demeaning way was a tantalizing point plot. I could imagine Ip Man visiting the martial arts school master one day to share a new technique he had just discovered and being similarly enlightened by his friend's growing body of knowledge.Anyway, excuse this digression into Shangri-La. This opening scene makes this a different martial arts movie all together for me. It is less about martial prowess and its honor and glory and gives a substantial nod to the values of family and community. The scene where Ip Man teaches a group of factory workers techniques so that they can defend themselves from the extortion of a gang of martial artists is a revelation in and of itself. It reminds one that in many cases,the martial arts is the product of a people of smaller physical stature who wanted to end victimizing conflicts quickly and to the result of overcoming possible oppressions.Director Wilson Yip has a gem on his hands that compares favorably to the 'ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA' Trilogy and is a quantum leap beyond the revenge aesthetic of 'THE Chinese CONNECTION' or 'FIST OF FURY'! Donnie Yen's Ip Man reminds me of some of the teachers I have studied under. They could be cheerful and yet firm and were not somebody you wanted to mess around with.I think this film brings one a step further into the Soul of the Martial Arts.",10,0,0,5 March 2012
The Dark Knight," Dark Heroism and Twisted Technological Hubris...
","This is a fascinating exploration of heroism and the nature of moral conscience. This quite frankly began with Frank Miller's graphic novel THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, which examined how a childhood tragedy and trauma could twist a man's psyche well into middle age and cause him to take drastic violent measures to exorcise that pain. Pretty heavy for a 'comic book'? You bet. It is definitely not your Boy Scout's version of BATMAN.I have read many of the reviews here; including Roger Ebert's very insightful take on the merits of THE DARK KNIGHT. The opinions are wide ranging and sometimes poles apart. I also found the data from Wikepedia to be quite helpful and highly recommend that you refer to it as well. I found all of the comments about the intricacies of plot and character and certain logical inconsistencies that may have proved grating to the intellect and sentiment engaging as well. This proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that THE DARK KNIGHT is a thought provoking piece of Cinema.I grew up revering a more lighthearted spin on heroism, having watched THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, THE MARK OF ZORRO and THE CRIMSON PIRATE in my youth. I rarely dwelt upon the fact that permanently injuring or killing others is in real life a grim and dirty business to be disapproved and dismissed as one of the more unworthy activities of human pursuit. This was all make-believe, right? So let's make believe that sending the unjust to the hospital ward or Hell or Valhalla is nothing more than a simple exercise in Fantasy. After all, nobody is really getting hurt or killed here. This is all stagecraft and special effects and the actors get to laugh all the way to the bank after giving us an exciting and hopefully cathartic manipulation and massage of emotions.That is right, isn't it? That is what this is all about, right?'Well,' the parent explains to the child with a wry smile, '...yes and no...'THE DARK KNIGHT is true Comic Book Opera. Definitely not the first and original entry into this genre, but it would seem to me, when considering it attractions and limitations, a very successful one. It's a long way from Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon and even the original Batman movie serials. These were primarily for kids with little or nothing to do on a Saturday afternoon. But, I don't think anyone can deny that THE DARK KNIGHT is one of the latest incarnations of what began as children's entertainment and is a direct extension of this.I found THE DARK KNIGHT has a marvelous musical flow and faithfully obeys the logic of it's own world. There is no use pretending this is a Batman for kids. It is not. The adults have hijacked the Superhero genre and medium to use for their own emotional needs and purposes. That is particularly true with regard to the events of 9/11, which I have seen referenced in the cinematic medium until it is fast becoming a clich√©. Owing to the influence of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, this version of THE DARK KNIGHT begins with a compelling, relentless musical score that never lets up and counterpoints itself well with the action on the screen. One could argue that there is way too much violence in this current saga of Batman, but it was Bruce Wayne's idea to solve crime with punishment coming from a stiff right cross and a pair of handcuffs, so what are you going to offer as an alternative? It is good of filmmaker Chris Nolan to at least subtly contemplate this idea without abandoning the principles and cinematic techniques he knows will pack them into the theaters to munch that popcorn. The plot has all the convoluted cliffhangers of the original Batman serials; albeit presented with a high-tech sophistication that the original version of the Dark Knight could not have possibly possessed, and packed into two and a half hours so that it comes across as either a jackpot of action or somewhat cloying to other tastes.One of the reviewers here commented that he watched this epic bored out of his skull in a nearly empty theater and another reported that he could predict everything that was going to happen because he understood the formula so well. This suggests to me that the aesthetics and mechanics of the roller-coaster ride may be wearing thin and its slip is showing. Personally, I did not feel this way. There is a deft and flamboyant handling of the concept of moral dilemma, and it was interesting to see black men step forward in a couple of cases and resolve these dilemmas with decisive conscience.No, I did not miss that in a couple of scenes the true heroes were a 'common' criminal and a highly trained scientist in service to big business and high technology.At the end, the titular hero resorts to fleeing in the night with the dogs coming after him like any runaway slave, attempting to escape a mindset of violent solution that has shackled him and reduced him and his hoped for replacement to fallen idols. This is an interesting turn of events with its own dark implications. Does the solution to the end of crime lie outside the domain of revenge and the redress of injustice with vengeance and punishment?I told you this was a thought provoking movie...",8,1,2,31 May 2016
2001: A Space Odyssey," A Tale of Natural, Technological and Spiritual Reinvention...
","I saw this film with my sister in Cinerama way back in 1968. I'll never forget the completely lost look on her face as she turned to me and asked innocently, 'What's going' on?' I chuckled and said nothing.Many people have to know before they can go, but I must say I have never had a problem with this. That is not to say that there are not a vast number of things beyond the ken of my understanding, but I have always felt that if you just keep on truckin' you will arrive at the Truth sooner or later.This is a stellar film (no pun intended) and once again rivals CITIZEN KANE for its sheer inventiveness. The inventiveness here, however, is not based on spending Saturday afternoons with the cinematographer learning novel ways to set up and use the camera to frame shots; as was the case with Welles and Toland, but is based on staggering and exhaustive research within and without the Space Program and various communities of High Technology.This is actually quite a simple film to understand, as it is designed to evoke mystery, to generate questions rather than answers, to launch the viewer on his or her own personal odyssey and voyage of discovery.That's really about it. This film is about as close to pure cinema as you are likely to get; with the possible exception of THE GOLD RUSH by Charlie Chaplin or Russian ARK by Alexander Sokurov, and yes, I could share all of my associations about the film with you, but what would be the point when that's the whole point? That is, your take on this movie is as good as mine and a great jumping off point into the realms of higher dimensions where together we can learn a great many new things.I will say this. I must have seen this movie over thirty times before I finally fully comprehended the gist of what Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were attempting to express, while after reading the second of Clarke's Odyssey novels I attained full understanding in mere seconds.Once again, this is really a simple film. I agree with Kubrick that it is meant to be a nonverbal experience aimed at arousing emotions and moods of awe and sublimity and at this succeeds enormously. I also agree with Roger Ebert that this is a fable for Mankind albeit from a Western perspective or standpoint. Unlike many movies, it defies surrendering to a surface interpretation and challenges you from the outset not necessarily to agree with its open-ended conclusions but rather to explore and understand it from the inside out as Frank Lloyd Wright used to exhort us to do.This film is also the gentlest introduction into the world of abstraction that I know pertaining to the cinema. I must admit it is one of the reasons I stumbled into the Fine Arts wanting to understand how the aesthetics of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was able to affect me so profoundly. Here, the Magician works his magic and leaves it to you to ferret out his secrets.I would like to conclude by saying that you might be interested in AN IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY by Roger Ager 2008 as more food for thought. Also, at the risk of uttering ironic heresy, I have to remark that I have been surprised here and there by how well atheists like Isaac Asimov understand the Concept of God.",10,3,5,11 July 2016
The Graduate," Where does 'The Graduate' go from here?
","I actually saw this movie for the first time in Louisville, Kentucky while competing in the Optimist Oratorical Contest. I must have been sixteen at the time, and what I remember most about the film was how it woke me up. I felt energized and trotted back to our rooms filled with inspiration and pep. What I got out of 'THE GRADUATE' was that you could, in the words of Paul Simon, '-get on the bus, Gus. Make a new plan, Stan-'and somehow even without rhyme or reason rise above the Status Quo.Everything in this film revolves around the title, 'THE GRADUATE', and the irony of this appellation in reference to the title character Benjamin Braddock. He has made his parents happy, met all of society's preliminary requirements with academic and athletic success in sports and games, and yet he basks like a gooey mass in the unawareness of society's expectations of him, or even the people in his immediate surroundings. What exactly is the nature of this 'graduation' he is experiencing at this time, and is it really supposed to feel this way?We were sitting in the lunch room one day when I was substitute teaching and listening to Doctor Peoples Ph.D explain how he got started coming up from down South to Detroit, Michigan. He explained how he initially stayed with friends and relatives and cast about looking for a job. Eventually, he found one at a Gas Station and worked his way up to managing the place because people kept coming up to him asking for information and solutions to their problems with their automobiles. He related an incident where one customer would repeatedly pepper him with requests and inquiries so that at length Doctor Peoples said to him, 'Why are you asking me all this?' The customer looked at him blankly and uttered, 'You looked like the one in charge-'All of us revered Doctor Peoples as he physically resembled a cross between Coleman Young and Joe Louis, the heavyweight boxing champ, and there was about him this unstated strength that placed him above the need to prove anything to anyone. I'll never forget him relating to us how when he was working steady and had some money in the bank, the folks he was staying with asked him humbly, 'You think you can make it now?' To which Doctor Peoples replied, just as humbly, 'Yeah,... I think I can make it..'The point of that little story is that I think all young people hope at some point they will 'look like the one in charge' and be able to say, '-I think I can make it now-Let me take it from here-'. The comedy of 'THE GRADUATE' to me was that we have here this product of higher education and yet there's no sense about him being eager to take charge of his life or being able to make it from here. You would think he would have some well defined sense of his own basic purpose by now, and yet it seems totally submerged under the obligation to meet the social proprieties of his times.Being a member of the Sixties generation I remember that one of our defining assertions was that the rewards of the Status Quo were not enough. The angst of Benjamin Braddock is beautifully interpreted by Dustin Hoffman. We have in Braddock a kind of walking zombie, stuffed to gills with information where a moral center should be, and filled with a need to truly care about something deeply enough to fight for it and figure out the problems attendant to getting it.The ending is troublesome and problematic while being exhilarating all at the same time, but I felt viscerally that somehow both Elaine and Benjamin finally graduated in demonstrating a willingness and ability to defy and rise above the Staus Quo.One of the great ironies of 'THE GRADUATE' is that the ending comes across as an 'anti-graduation' and an 'un-marriage', as Elaine and Benjamin have cast themselves away from the safety nets of family, community and even the aegis of the Church, but it is anything but that. It is simply a small step for two people who are experiencing a kind of self creation on uncharted waters where anything is possible. Perhaps even a new sense of Family, a new sense of Community, and a new sense of what it means to experience religion and the Church.That's what it was like to come up in the sixties, folks...",9,1,2,2 May 2012
Pulp Fiction," A Study in Scatology
","President Regan once was quoted as saying you can't argue with success and the Honorable Elijah Muhammud was represented by Spike Lee as telling Malcolm X to keep his mouth shut about a man who has won the love of the people. This seems like sound advice to me, but the time has come at last to give my two cents about a film known as PULP FICTION. There are those who hate it and those who love it and those who shrug their shoulders not knowing quite what to make of it. I freely admit I belong to the third category. I don't revere it, I don't condemn it; and the way Quentin Tarantino bookends the movie with the beginning scene is kind of clever and interesting. But I sure don't see what all the hoopla is about. The stuff packed in between the two slices of narrative bread is not god awful or gems of shimmering brilliance, it's just standard shock-o-rama to me. I didn't mind watching it and would not mind watching it again except for all this undue emphasis on how important it is to Film Culture. I hope you will forgive me for not seeing it that way.PULP FICTION is a cultural curiosity to me. Sort of like the ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. I can think of half a dozen films I can more easily and wholeheartedly embrace and which more naturally duplicate my thoughts and feelings and deeply felt ideas. When I first saw PULP FICTION, I was hoping at the end of the roundup there would be some kind of moral resonance to the whole thing, but it was simply too shallow to produce that kind of effect. It's more like a hodgepodge of cultural references, nearly all of which veer in the direction of the scatological. Some of the references hit an emotional chord and some don't in my mind.I remember seeing LET IT BE with my friend Scott in Black Lake, Michigan. This was a documentary about the Beatles. I found the picture exhilarating because of how it recorded the incubatory introversion of the creative process the band went through before experiencing the celebratory extroversion of live performance. Scott did not think there were enough exciting parts to hold his interest. I also remember seeing Fellini's AMARCORD with Louie Whitehead and realizing while mentally comparing it to about a hundred films in a few seconds how remarkable it was that it did not focus on Sex and Violence to carry the story forward. That being so, Louie was kind of dissatisfied with it and I confessed I did not think as highly of AMARCORD as I did of Fellini's THE CLOWNS. All I can say is that different people of necessity have different tastes and sensibilities.My dissatisfaction with PULP FICTION is that unlike Kurosawa's film HIGH AND LOW there is no 'high and low'! All the characters are lowlifes, but represented as strong and resourceful while the so-called 'straight types' like the college students are represented as ineffectual and weak. PULP FICTION completes the moral and cultural inversion first presented by Francis Ford Coppola's THE GODFATHER, but this time played even more for laughs. I just don't see much value in all of this.I suppose if Ned Beatty could be sodomized in DELIVERANCE, owing to equal opportunity Ving Rhames could be sodomized in PULP FICTION, but the truth is I would rather see him play someone like A.G. Gaston, than someone like Al Capone. I enjoyed watching Bruce Willis chose between a chain-saw and a katana before rescuing Rhames' character from the pommel horse, but even he comes across as a character of dubious honor.Perhaps, I should not quibble about the Whore with the Heart of Gold now being joined by the Hit-man with the Heart of Gold. It is just that Divine Intervention for hired killers is too perverse and cruel a Cosmic Joke for me.Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta play fascinating characters as Jules and Vincent, but they seem more like supporting characters than leads. My problem with PULP FICTION is that there did not seem to be any character, except for a few moments with Bruce Willis, I could wholeheartedly relate to and embrace. All of them, one way or another, seemed to be stained with sleaze or wallowing in it. Uma Thurman gives a creditable performance as the wife of Marsellus Wallace and Christopher Walken's off-color story is hilarious, but it all comes across as a world you want to handle in a glove or a puzzle box so as not to get any of it on you. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer (bearing the name of a character in one of my three-act plays, by the way) depart a Mexican standoff against Jules and Vincent with their lives and all their ill-gotten gains, but are they really any the wiser? Leaving, they come across as an ersatz version of Adam and Eve exiting the Garden of Evil rather than Eden.Much has been made of the non-linearity of the narrative structure and no doubt something can be learned from Tarantino's musical handling of his scenes. This leads me to conclude you can get people to believe and accept anything just by making the images flow in harmony with the musical score. Once again, it seems to me I have seen non-linearity handled better in other pieces, most notably and recently in RUN, LOLA, RUN, but Tarantino does a good job with it here. It is just when it comes time to deliver the moral of the story, PULP FICTION seems to come up with insufficient funds.",7,0,1,12 February 2014
Thor," East of Eden in Asgard...
","Right now, I am looking at my accurate, true-to-scale, panoramic Picto-Map of a typical Asgard street scene, drafted by the late, great Jack Kirby and compliments of the early, here and now Stan Lee! I am mentally comparing this street scene of daily life in Odin's realm and everything appears to be in order. Here, under the MONUMENT TO THE UNKNOWN WARRIOR, I am expecting a party of twelve to help me take in the sights. Unfortunately, we will not be visiting the RAINBOW BRIDGE as we have been informed it is presently undergoing reconstruction...Cudos to the men and women of the Art Department and the Special Effects Department for taking the designs and plans of Lee and Kirby and using them as blueprints to transform what are essentially colored sketches into a living, breathing reality whose boulevards and avenues can be strolled by true to life people. This alone is worth the price of admission to 'THOR', a film directed by Kenneth Branagh and boasting a cast with the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Rene Russo, Natalie Portman, Idris Elba, and capable newcomers such as Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston. The screenplay, crafted by Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne, has ample mood and pace, and 'BABYLON FIVE' J. Michael Straczynski, along with Mark Protosevich also seem to have contributed substantially to the thematic infrastructure of this interface between Science and Technology/Dream and Mythology.'THOR' is essentially a morality tale for children about the pitfalls of Pride and how it can lead to warmongering and uncalled for destruction and the virtues of humility and how it can lead to spiritual renewal and reconciliation. It takes the concept of the Invincible Warrior of the West which has been the bane of aboriginal peoples and leavens it with the Christian Ethic of rational sacrifice for the greatest good exercising the principle of the greatest love espoused by Jesus from what many would tell you is the highest authority. It does so in such a playful and witty way that should you blink, you just might miss it.After that, it is back to Warriors and Monsters and the political intrigues fueled by sibling rivalry and infantile good intentions gone awry. The Western deification of patriarchal power bolstered by the triumph of Science and Technology plays out its idea matrix creating new divisions and spiritual unities and setting the stage for the next act of this fairy tale in progress beyond the stars.Oh, by the way, you can find that Picto-Map of Asgard in the MARVEL TREASURY EDITION of THE MIGHTY THOR Volume One, Number Three, 1974.",7,0,0,14 March 2012
12 Years a Slave," Down the Rabbit-Hole into Slavery...
","'Twelve Years a Slave' is a tightly written, well-crafted film that further explores Ingmar Bergman's assertion that Film has nothing to do with Literature, but shares greater affinities with Painting, Music and Photography. The film itself is beautiful to look at; owing to its Director Steve McQueen and its Cinematographer Sean Bobbitt as well as its Film Editor Joe Walker. While others I talked to found the film 'brutal', I found it remarkably restrained and its narrative compelling without being driven by the roller-coaster pyrotechnics of films post Indiana Jones. The film explores a set of issues with intelligence albeit going down a well-trodden road. The Three Laws of Fred Williamson are applied here for once with a subtle sophistication and a hint of profound implication rarely to be seen during the Blaxploitation Era.The subject matter being as fulsome as it is, I was not exactly foaming at the mouth to see this one. After all, nobody needed to tell me who would be playing the Masters and who would be playing the Slaves. Just as toy dogs fly well when kicked, African Americans and sundry other people of color make great victims to pivot the story around in films such as 'Spartacus' and 'The Sting'. Here in a culture that glories in violence and falls in love so easily with death projected on the silver screen, Blacks make excellent fodder for the pigs in the slaughterhouse.While I was watching 'Twelve Years a Slave', my mischievous imagination started itching me. There must be a parallel universe somewhere, I figured, where Blacks were herding Whites into waiting ships to be sent to distant lands and auctioned off for their strength, beauty and utility in a thousand and one ways as well as to be a supplementary source of energy more valuable than coal or oil. However, this was not to be that story, and 'Twelve Years a Slave' hews pretty close to the formula for this kind of fare.The twist here is that Solomon Northrup starts out a free man privy to all the amenities of his times. That is before someone can whisper in his ear that the white man speaks with a forked tongue and he then finds himself waking up in chains. This turn of events comes after a night of revelry with new-found friends, who, unbeknownst to Northrup, are looking for another slave to log into the books. At this point, the gate begins to swing wide on the horrors of the antebellum South.Chiwetel Ejiofor's Solomon Northrup is a gifted and intelligent man able to postulate his own solutions to many problems and this becomes apparent throughout the narrative. But here in Slave Country his skills and talents win him no reward or empowerment, simply the inverse of such phenomena. This is heart-wrenching to watch and makes you want to grab something hard to hit somebody with. It is the age-old conundrum. How do you reason with someone who simply wants to control and dominate you for the thrill and empowering pleasure of it? Is feeling superior to someone or something really that valuable an experience?Discuss amongst yourselves.Perhaps the most troubling character is Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey. She is a woman born and bred into slavery. You see her producing two to two and a half times as much product picking cotton as any of the other slaves male or female. Today she would probably be working her way up the ladder to running her own company and eventually rubbing elbows with Oprah Winfrey. But here in this cultural context, her exceptional production wins her abuse, disfigurement and mutilation and the choice between cultural murder of the spirit and the body by degrees at the hands of slave owners or the death wish of the suicide.I'll have to admit I was glad she won an Oscar for such an anguishing and haunting portrayal.The flashbacks to Northrup's life prior to slavery are musically handled and the scene at the end of Northrup meditating upon his misery is one of the best interior monologues I have seen in Cinema. The cast is well rounded out with veterans like Alfre Woodard, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sarah Paulson and Paul Dano holding down supporting roles. Until that film comes out where whites are walking in chains seething with self hatred, I'll have to tip my hat to the elevated craft of 'Twelve Years a Slave'.There are three additional thoughts of note that have come to mind. While I do not plan to be doing any slave owning any time soon, it seems to me Patsey's 'owners' might have been curious as to how she was outproducing all the other slaves in her party. Could it be possible she was using advanced techniques that could be shared with her other brethren, or was she simply exercising a higher level of manual dexterity due to her gender? The other thing that came to mind is that I was finally convinced due to the meditative quality of this film that the great Carter G. Woodson was right. The African mind is essentially an Oriental mind. Finally, it seems to me that 'Twelve Years a Slave' can be seen as a darker (no pun intended) version of 'Sullivan Travels'.But, unlike the Butler in 'Sullivan's Travels', I do not advise you to shun the subject of slavery even for the purposes of study.",9,1,5,12 March 2014
Bring It On," The Black and White of Ideas
","When I was rehearsing my one-act play 'The Arms of Infinity' at the Concept East Theater that used to be on Adams street here in Detroit, the great James Wheeler used to talk about how fashion designers would come here and cruise the streets intently studying what African Americans were wearing this year and that later, you would find the same designs that folks had thrown together selling for top dollar in the most fashionable salons and stores across America. I'll have to admit I didn't put much stock in this, or simply shrugged 'so what', but the movie 'Bring It On' brought this subject up again and seemed to validate my mentor's assertion and observation. The movie also reminded me of something Picasso was quoted as having said; 'You either do it first, or you do it better.''Bring It On' is a lighthearted look at how Western Culture feels privileged to appropriate ideas from other cultural milieus without making proper acknowledgement that it has done so. There was a knowing nod from me and others in the audience when vivacious Torrance is given a 'reality check' that the winning routine her cheer-leading squad is famous and renowned for actually comes from an all-black cheer-leading squad led by the beautiful Isis. This was a tiny glimmer of light emitted from raising up the lid just a degree to see what was actually cooking in our cultural melting pot. Somehow it always seems novel to me when it is revealed that African Americans, Indians, and various other peoples of the Orient such as the Japanese, the Chinese and the folks of India actually did have a better idea and are the source of successful actions that can be broadly applied for the benefit of all.When I was young, every major accomplishment or idea worthy of note owed its source to some Caucasian mind. At the time, in elementary school, I just wanted my 'A's and the sheer thrill of excelling, though I could have forgone the cookie we got when I would be invited to the Principal's office with a few other students for having made the honor roll. It rarely occurred to me to question how this could be so. That is, how History was basically a collection of success stories about White People. How they were largely responsible for the quality of life in the world, all the major inventions and advances in technology and were presently investigating and plumbing the secrets of the Universe. As long as the cookies and the punch kept coming at the end of each semester, what did I care?I loved giving reports on the lives of famous men who pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and did something with their lives. People like Theodore Roosevelt, the nerd who became a He-Man, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Daniel Boone and the various Indian Fighters. Therefore I was surprised when I did my report on Frederick Douglass at the irritated suggestion of my father asking ('-why don't you ever do any reports on Black People?'); that my teacher didn't know who he was! She stopped me in the middle of my report and called in the Assistant Principal who admitted she never heard of him either! After that, the teacher from next door was called in but she didn't have a clue. So I was told it was great I decided to do a report about somebody who was 'active in the community', but I really better sit down now.Where I am going with all this is that the one of the most closely guarded secrets is how many non-Western minds are responsible for the shape of the World as it exists today. It's a wonderful thing to investigate and opens up a new dimension on reality that is at once invigorating and exhilarating. I love finding out that Pizza and Spaghetti actually have their origins in China, that the Pilgrims were having a hard time of it through some rough winters until the Indians shared their technology with them, that George Washington Carver played a large role in developing the K-Rations for soldiers in the field, and that a fictional white Cheer-leading Squad called the Toros were best able to win when they modeled themselves after another fictional black Cheer-leading Squad called the Clovers to insure their success.We can get into the misbegotten idea that 'All Art is a Form of Cultural Theft', but let's leave that can of worms with the moneychangers for another day. All I know is that if so-called Whites can come to so-called Blacks for ideas about Cheer-leading techniques, rock and roll songs and inspiring jazz riffs, does the African and African American influence really end there? Or does it permeate and infuse other arenas of thought and Life as well?Here beginneth the adventure. Something for Quentin Tarantino to take note about when he is through applying the Three Laws of Fred Williamson.",7,0,0,16 January 2013
Black Panther," Straight Out of Wakanda...
","This is more than a film. The Black Panther movie is a cultural phenomenon. A fresh and sterling example of how it takes the whole world to help the whole world achieve a higher and more salutary plane and state of survival. This should be painfully obvious, but evidently needs restating every now and then with all the ways and means available and at our disposal.There is an understated depth and complexity to this movie that viewers and fans will be exploring and discovering and debating and enlightening themselves about for years to come. After the dust has cleared and settled from all the knee-jerk reactions and cultural shock, mine included, people will at length be done shaking their heads with a wry smile at how two Jewish Americans also members of a group persecuted throughout the millennia could somehow through a medium designed for soldiers at war and more particularly for children find themselves members among the unlikely authors of a re-genesis of African and Human Consciousness.This is essentially what Jack Kirby and Stan Lee have done. Make no mistake about it. The Black Panther is the brainchild and the product of the Marvel Universe which is the invention and result of visionary artists and writers such as Kirby and Lee who postulated it into existence.The appeal here is to the imaginative prowess of Mankind. Many writers and artists of color were so mired down in the angst of the oppression and exploitation of indigenous peoples around the world and their victimization that they were hard put to envision a place and a time where and when this would no longer be the case. Richard Wright was able to have his protagonist Bigger Thomas consider why Blacks did not have their own governments and armies in a nascent fashion, but his roadmap to Wakanda and other destinations of interest in Africa was somehow misplaced. Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Dubois were busily engaged in postulating an education for African Americans that might proof them against and preclude future involvement with slavery, but only Marcus Garvey and a few others, possessed the pluck, through whatever personal limitations, to suggest that there could be a United States of Africa or a Commonwealth of African States. We have yet to postulate a media which will celebrate the industrial, entrepreneurial, and technological triumphs of people of color in concert with the peoples of the world, bu this movie is a step in the right direction.There is more that can be said and, I'm sure, will be said. But for now, let me just say, kudos to the cast and crew. You have done a monumental thing. Perhaps one day we will consider as well the Epic of Sundiata and Gassiere's Lute as appropriate grist for the Cinema...",10,2,9,16 May 2019
The Matrix," Shadows and the Substance of Things to Come
","A perfect metaphor for Hollywood! Part of the Mass Indoctrination Machine that educates us to worship shadows and not to probe beyond the surfaces of what we see for the inner workings of it all. Now this is a film with meat on its bones both thematically and technically. What is not touched upon here? There is the interface between 'reality' and 'illusion', a very cinematic take on Plato's Allegory of the Cave, a consideration of reification versus abstraction aided by CGI imagery to nail down all the particulars.Here you have the process that must be undergone to conquer every prejudice, every narrow-minded POV that precludes the unleashing of true potential and beingness. What must be renounced and destroyed in our illusionary constructs to seize upon a new and more salutary truth? What must be accepted and embraced to be newly constructed as the rebirth of Truth? We have in this film presented in a very entertaining way a means of exploring these concepts from a fresh perspective.THE MATRIX is a perfect paradigm for the Computer and Information Age, where the energy of machines becomes a surrogate for passion and data itself is the substance of a Hell masquerading as Heaven. Keanu Reeves as the Computer Programmer/Computer Hacker Neo is a secret rebel against the Status Quo without realizing that what he is rebelling against is beyond even the range of his understanding. The legendary Morpheus comes into his life to pull his coat about what's really going on, but first must send him into the abyss of his own unreality turned inside out and back again.Because of the limitations of Cinema, no plausible utopian worlds are postulated realistically; only the idea of a universe at constant war with itself involving citizens awake and citizens still slumbering. This is all very artfully and dramatically explored, with beleaguered humanity fighting in a wasteland to reclaim a vision that long ago was co-opted by their data spewing machines.The beauty of THE MATRIX is that it fully rests on Cinema's strengths; its ability to create artifice and circus like magic tricks in a spellbinding way. It also serves up and reveals its primary weakness; its inability to pierce the skin of the apple and go to the core of experiences and ideas even when to all the world that appears to be precisely what it is doing.There is not much more I can add about this ground breaking work, rooted as it is in this new cultural mileau of ever advancing data assimilation towards a global awareness of what it takes to run a planet or even a universe populated with slaves operating as the servo-mechanisms for those sentient entities forging their chains with the stuff that dreams are made of, but it looks good and it rides good and who knows but that it might somehow lead you to read a book and create your own abstractions to reify?",8,1,2,20 March 2016
Green Book," One Odd Couple for the Road...
","This is a fine movie about what makes for friendship across cultures. At the beginning, the gruff 'Tony Lip' Vallelonga played by Viggo Mortensen seems too down with it and streetwise to meaningfully bond with the exalting Doctor Don Shirley as stirringly represented by Mahershala Ali. However, through the course of the narrative, their characters prove to have complementary angles that eventually add up to the 180 degrees needed for a stable friendship.The truth is people like Doctor Don Shirley are much more familiar to me than characters like John Shaft and Priest Youngblood. Black Folks can seem like everyday people until you sit down and talk to them and gradually find they are revealed as highly accomplished, and, more often than not, formally or informally expert in some field or another. I knew this fellow named Amos, an older gentleman I worked with when I was transporting cars around the lot at Hertz Rent-A-Car. Anyone could tell him about a major or minor problem they were having with their car, and you would swear you were listening to Sherlock Holmes, the way he could deduce from signs and symptoms what was wrong with your automobile, or less charitably, a professor at a Community College giving a lecture on Automotive Mechanics.We would hear about what happened to the John Shaft and Priest Youngblood types in anecdotes. Usually, how they had been thrown in the river or died in some kind of shootout. But the Don Shirleys of the world I more easily found myself crossing paths with in some way or another. There were the magnetic and charismatic individuals like Reverend Spahn, who would come to our house and wax rhapsodic about Gandhi, and the sense of liberation he discovered and experienced devoting himself to the service of others. There were other folks like the Reverend Tommy Butler, who wrote and directed the Pulitzer Prize caliber musical SELMA, with followers and devotees comparing him to Duke Ellington, not withstanding that he was also a third degree Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do. So running into every day people who, when you scratched the surface, were highly accomplished in one way or another, was more commonplace within the Black Community than you might imagine.Doctor Don Shirley, you could say, represents the apex of his ilk. A man who, evidently, spoke several languages and was the proud possessor of several academic degrees, while being feted around the world as a great classical and jazz pianist. He still finds himself, whether he realizes it or not, in need of serious security and the muscle of an Italian American bouncer, notwithstanding his true status as a member of intellectual and artistic royalty. He will also be depending on a guide book compiled by Victor Hugo Green as he makes his way through the Midwest and the racism of the Deep South with his concert tour.There are surprises galore as the two men evolve past their own prejudices against each other and use their wits and good will to navigate through the chauvinism of their times. The director Peter Farrelly, with a penetrating sociological and psychological insight that hits more often than it misses, drives along with this unlikely pair through the cold and the snow home to the rousing musical score of Kris Bowers. Seems we are just in time for dinner, not far from the street sign that reads LIFETIME FRIENDSHIP.I would also like to thank a beloved friend for recommending this movie to me and bringing me here as well.",9,0,0,25 March 2020
Hacksaw Ridge," AMAZING SPIDERMAN ON HACKSAW RIDGE!
","I knew of Andrew Garfield's prior portrayal as Peter Parker AKA Spiderman in the movie THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN (2012). I thought this movie was a marvelous evolution to a more adult character dealing with similar themes.What came to mind, perhaps oddly, while I was watching this movie, was the issue of THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN Comic Book #4. How one could transition out of adolescence reading that, to this more adult version of earning the respect of one's peers without sacrificing one's principles or values. This film also made me flash briefly about THE LAST ANGRY MAN (1959) with Paul Muni, another work of the cinema about an individual who could stick to his ideals.The meditations on the virtues of violence versus non-violence are presented with better balance than in the uber brutal THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST (2004), and the ending is truly exhilarating. What makes it all the more astounding is its roots in fact. The characters all seemed like people I would know in the neighborhood, facing real life issues with the intensity of inner conflicts that sometimes boil over and explode.There's no use beating around the bush about this; while I'm no particular fan of Sex and Violence in the narrative, Gibson's handling of the chaos and atrocities of war are the work of a master craftsman here. There is the sense of a growing rationale and aesthetic sensibility to his treatment of horrifics that tempts one to revisit APOCALYPTO (2006), and even THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST. There is a well-reasoned exploration of the male ethic that demands consideration in HACKSAW RIDGE.The movie is framed in the deliberations of social responsibility and romance. When it closes with the death defying heroics of an action hero, saving lives instead of taking them, it feels like the character study of Desmond Doss has come full circle to a satisfactory conclusion. Hugo Weaving shows a surprising range as the father Tom Doss, and the chemistry between Garfield and Teresa Palmer as his love interest and future wife, Dorothy Shutte, is palpable and real. The rest of the ensemble of supporting characters is nearly seamless from Vince Vaughn as Sergeant Howell to Rachel Griffiths as Desmond's mother, Bertha, among all the others.",8,0,0,13 May 2020
The Godfather," The Mystique of 'The Godfather'...
","Now I have seen 'THE GODFATHER' and its sequels a number of times and can even recite the dialog of whole scenes word for word. I took my father to see it on his birthday back in the seventies, because I thought he would get a kick out of seeing someone who, like himself didn't speak much, but when he did, made it count. I think he fell asleep here and there during the film, but then, he was just a man holding down a full time job and taking care of his family.I remember first reading the novel, which I rated as a cultural curiosity somewhere in quality between 'THE DAY OF THE JACKAL' and 'MANDINGO'. The film we enjoyed because of Brando's at that time offbeat performance and the strong ensemble cast. When I went to see 'NOTHING BUT A MAN' with my friend Donald Mack, besides him commenting to me, '-this ain't no movie, this is real-', I remember Ivan Dixon telling Gloria Foster in the movie that he was turning out to be just like his father. The manner in which Al Pacino portrays Michael Corleone you see this process of transformation rather than hear the character tell of it. Though in the original screenplay that I was fortunate to read recently, Michael does indeed tell his father, '-and now I'm just like you.'Francis Ford Coppola has made many interesting statements about this unlikely and serendipitous masterpiece he has wrought. Some of the reviewers have compared it to 'DEATH OF A SALESMAN' complete with a spaghetti dinner, and Coppola himself once compared Don Vito Corelone to King Lear, a man whose void will be hard to fill ere his Kingdom is to be kept from collapsing. Michael, as we come to discover, has the cold Machiavellian cunning, Santino has the muscular viciousness, Fredo the sweetness of a kindly sense of compassion, and Tom as the adopted son the calm deliberation for moderation, and yet not one of these individuals has all these attributes so harmoniously blended into their personality as the Don himself.And who is this Don Vito Coreleone? A man alone with his own thoughts who well realizes he could have been more than he is given an uplifting childhood environment and better circumstances. A natural leader who is even something of a statesman to hear Mario Puzo tell it in his novel, who yet and still played by Brando is a walking shell of a man able to offer his family nothing beyond their material success other than an incremental spiritual decay. Should you doubt this, review the endings of 'THE GODFATHER-II' and 'THE GODFATHER-III again. Now that I look back on it, I don't believe 'THE GODFATHER' would have become the success it is today were someone else to have acted Brando's role. There is an intelligence and a liveliness to all the portrayals from Diane Keaton to Robert Duvall to James Caan and others, but there is something haunting and understated about Brando's performance in this film that speaks to the mystery of unfulfilled human potential. Of all the performances that I revisit in this movie from time to time his is the only one that seems to have grown in stature over the years. Sure, I understand better now what a tight spot Michael was in with the death of Santino, and now sitting at his father's funeral, watching Barzini shake hands with his colleagues as though he were the heir apparent, he realizes that he is just the next item to be checked off on the list in a power struggle he inherited more than signed up to fight. That is, unless like Telemachos, he can carry out the plan he and his father designed before Don Vito went off to his grave.I know my girlfriend at the time felt cheated and disappointed with Brando's performance. She wanted more of Stanley Kowalski's animal vitality or the roaring declaiming of Brando as Mark Anthony in 'JULIUS CAESAR'! But I understood, even though I was not at first viscerally affected by it so much, what Brando was doing. The acting that Brando does in 'THE GODFATHER' is the acting of personal presence altitude. The power of his portrayal comes not from what he says or does, but from what he doesn't say or does. It is an understated performance that evokes and causes you to add your own connotations to what he is doing. Here is a self made man who somehow worked himself through material success from something to nothing and is puzzling to himself how he got there, but he is not going to let you see him doing it.I know and have read how Pacino and many others thought he should have been nominated for Best Actor honors along with Marlon Brando and whether he should have or not is more than I know. All I do know is that there were times when the action got hot and furious, and that I was tensely waiting for Don Vito Corelone to appear again, not say or do anything particularly, just appear, and somehow by just appearing stabilize the narrative and bring some kind of sense and order to his surroundings. There are people like that, you know. I remember when I would watch 'Young Abe Lincoln' there was a point in the story where Lincoln played by Henry Fonda would not be physically in the scene, and yet you could feel his shadow over the entire proceedings. Brando's Don Vito Corelone is the moral inversion of all of this. When he lays his plans with his son Michael, you glimpse the roles that Brando could have played; Socrates, Ernest Hemingway, and even Black Elk. The roles of idealism that James Coburn berated him for not playing. And who can say there wasn't time, there just wasn't time?",10,1,3,2 May 2012
