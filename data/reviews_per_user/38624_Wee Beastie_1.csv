The Blair Witch Project," Horror? Are you sure?
","It is beyond me that anyone could find this movie frightening. Totally unnecessary and over used bad language, with an ending that left me angry that I'd even bothered to watch that far. What frightened me most is the thought that there might be a sequel. Arghhh! I spoke too soon. Don't waste your time and money on this film.",1,2,4,25 May 2000
