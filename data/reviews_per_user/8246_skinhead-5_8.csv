Source Code," Mix up of films?
","A bit of a slow starter for this film but when finally gets going it's a fairly good enjoyable movie. Not too many surprises with this one though there are hints of several films and movie directions in it. Take the concept of Inception and Quantum Leap with a hint of Vantage point (you'll see this as the film moves on) and Final Destination with the repeating coffee and ticket inspector scenes.There's a bit of everything in here but although the films lacks the punch of Inception. The acting from some of the people is a bit lacklustre and revolves more around the plot. However the resulting feeling of the whole film is that you leave the cinema a bit disappointed, not quite sure about the ending. I just get the impression the writers gave up or the budget was stretched so it seemed 'cut short'. Although just as you are about to grab your coat and get up there's a bit more of it. What is a big disappointed was the capture of the Derek Frost, they could of an effort on this one instead of leaving you wanting to fill in the gaps.While the plot is implausible I didn't think for one minute it was going to be an epic with the unknowns in it, but it makes up in effects.",7,0,3,1 April 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," 10 out of 10 even after watching this film 20 times!
","I still give this film 10 of 10 even though I watched it over 20 times now. It's one of those films that you can sit down and watch and still have the excitement as the first time you saw it. You may struggle with the plot line if you haven't seen the other previous Bourne films but with a litte thought will get you into the plot.It's full on suspense, action and stunningly shot photography from the word go. It will have you on the edge of your seat even after watching it several times. Watching this film only wants to make reach for other two and start all over again.I can't see how (if he does go for a Bourne 4) they can improve on this film as the ending is so perfect. So perfect that you could make another one from it or call it a day. In any case it has to Bourne (Matt Damon) who needs to conclude or continue this series.It makes Bond look a bit 80's.",10,4,6,18 November 2010
28 Weeks Later," A plot to far
","Not as good as the original 28 Day Later, for those of us who live in London there are some mega goofs including the London City Airport bit that suddenly turns into some international airport! The general feel of the story was not as well conceived as the original and all the scary bits where only 'scary' due to the loud repeated music at certain times. It was all very predictable, zombie finds you...etc...Also what right minded person would enter a tube station, the Woolwich Foot Tunnel and other locations sub-Terra with Rage on the loose! The effects where good but the mixture of 'film' and 'digital' but in some cases this was just too hard to follow. It all got a bit lack lustre and had be reaching for my jacket before the film ended but I managed to watch all of it. What next..... 28 Years later, with a bit of luck i may be suffering Rage by then! It's worth the watch however, for those of you who love London scenes will love it even though there are some goofs along the way! A.R.",5,1,3,14 May 2007
District 9," Hidden Metaphor?
","This is one of those films that make you reach for the door of cinema or the remote control of your DVD to turn it off in the first ten minutes, but hold off.The first fifteen minutes of the film is slow and sets out the basic plot for the film even though you don't actually see the aliens arrive, they are just 'there' from the word go. This in hand there are a lot of shots in the style of 'Cloverfield' but instead of a group of amatures filming it's a TV reporter and his film crew creating what is basically going to set the scene for what is about to follow. There is some very Paul Verhoevenesque (Robocop) scenes, for instance at parts it feels like a news report on the BBC with Kate Adie somewhere in a war zone which in effect it is. It's basically Aliens lands, alien attacks (accidently) a human, humans respond by blaming aliens then so on. However I sat watching this with someone from SA and he pointed out that townships were like this, no law, gangs and lack of any form of a decent life.As you get into the film the narrative changes from the aspect of the reporter to a full on film. As the story line unfolds you cannot disguise the fact there are parallels between a South Africa from the time of apartheid with the government forcing 'blacks' out of townships. You just can't help not thinking there are some very disturbing political overtones of the story line. In fact the majority of the film is shot in townships that would not look out of place even in this day and age. It's also rare to see a film thats shot in Johannesburg yet alone anywhere in South Africa.",7,1,7,22 November 2010
The Bourne Legacy," Awful full follow on with no substance.
","Well just seen The Bourne Legacy.It really was a pile of tosh. Really awful direction, dreadful acting and a mere hint of the previous incumbents does not warrant a Bourne film. It's rather akin to a Bond film without Bond. They obviously thought by using the previous names like Bourne, Kramer and Landy it would be a success. Well, no..... Poor and lame attempt to follow on three otherwise great films. Not really worth the cinema time. Just leave to the experts! You would also think by listing Pamela Landy in the titles you think she had a big part...no she didn't. It really is The Bourne Redundancy. The first thirty minutes of the film is really yawnful and the use of previous footage is somewhat an insult as they think this just makes everything stick. Bring Back Matt Damon.",1,11,23,13 August 2012
Unknown," A Boune-ish Affair
","Before watching this film you should take a look at Neesons previous film 'Taken'. Then have a look at the last two Bourne films. You'll see the same type of production with dark, moody filming, wobbly 'hand held shots' with a documentary feeling. They even stole some Inception ideas with the slow motion car crashing off the bridge. Berlin looks good in these sort of films as the city has a backdrop of a bygone era that still exists within it's architecture.Neeson takes his role seriously and is very convincing post crash. He is not as sharp as his role in Taken but he is nether the less good with his gritty voice and dialogue. I suspect Neeson was held back some by dubious support acting and he makes the most of what he has to play with.There is something for everyone but I can gauge how good a film is if I decide to buy it on DVD or Blu-Ray. Taken I bought the Blu-Ray, this, i'll buy the DVD.",10,0,0,20 July 2011
Taken," Roller Coaster of a ride!
","This is a great film for those of you like you're films in the fast lane. The action starts almost the moment the film starts and it will have tearing at the seats and throwing the occasional punch in the air from your sofa. The locations are good as well as it shows the grim (an truthful) side of Paris. You can really a feel of what is going through his mind and the result will grip you right to the end.I won't add nothing that will ruin your viewing but get it in Blu-Ray on a big telly and enjoy. There are a few films that you will watch several times but this one of them. It's also very Bourne-ish with the music, car chases and filming style.",10,1,2,14 February 2011
National Treasure," A yomp around fantasy
","If you like a good old fashioned yarn with a basic story line of finding treasure with a couple of sub plots you'll like the film. It's a bit of a remake of Raiders of the Lost Ark, but that's no bad thing. It makes a pleasant change that you can sit down and watch a film no matter what age you are, it romps along without hardly a break keeping everyone interested until the end. Also without a plethora of 'blow em up' scenes and overdoses of CGI you and your kids can watch it with granny on a wet winters night.Take it with a punch of salt, take it for a good old yomp around fantasy land...",7,1,1,19 October 2010
