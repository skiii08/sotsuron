Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Jack Sparrow is back...'oh! there must be a captain in there somewhere'
",I saw pirates 4 last week.i enjoyed this movie a lot.this movie has plenty of action sequences..some nice camera work..good CGI..nice acting especially by the lovable Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp) and the hot chick Penelope Cruz..i did have some disappointment when i first heard that will and Elizabeth characters are missing..but surprisingly they are never missed in the film..the best part of the film were the mermaids..they are hot and beautiful...Geoffery Rush as captain Barboosa and Ian Mcshane as the evil blackbeard were all awesome..these are the positives..there are also some flaws..but allover this is a worthy summer popcorn flick..my mark is a 7 out of 10....,7,0,1,18 June 2011
Shutter Island," 'Martin-Dicaprio combo does it again'
","I saw shutter island last night.Really loved the movie.The movie starts off slowly at the beginning.But the second half is fast paced with many good twists and suspense.Martin has once again proved that he is a masterpiece in direction,also Dicaprio and Benkingsley have done a great job.The screenplay was excellent.The best part of the movie really comes in the last 30 minutes.I hope that this film will be nominated as one of the Oscar contenders for 2011.It is one of the best movies of 2010.so i give this movie a 9/10",9,1,4,20 March 2010

Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Michael bay delivers...this is the best of the series..
","hi everyone,i saw transformers 3 today.I went to this movie with huge expectations and gladly those expectations were mostly met.The film starts off on a positive note and Slightly loses its grip somewhere in the middle.then again returns back to end on a positive note..About the positives-this film has some jaw dropping mind blowing action sequences.this is a typical Michael Bay film where the tag line is explosion.Special effects are masterfully done.3D is also effectively used.I guess there are only two directors in Hollywood who know how to present a movie in 3D and they are none other than Michael Bay and James Cameron.I thought i would miss Megan FOX.But surprisingly i didn't.Rosie Huntington and Shia Lebouf shared a good chemistry.Also Frances Mcdormand deserves a special mention.Finally coming to the negatives-This film has no strong plot.The running time is overly long.First half was slow paced.Some big names like John Malkovich were terribly wasted.But anyhow on the whole,the positives outweigh the negatives.This is the best of the series.So i advice you guys to go to the cinemas,grab a popcorn and enjoy a roller coaster ride.Michael Bay rocks.......my rating 8/10",8,1,5,1 July 2011
