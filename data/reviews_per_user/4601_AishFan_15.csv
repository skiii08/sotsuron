Catch Me If You Can," Bit of a drag but still good
","This wasn't as slick as the usual Speilberg films.  Coming from such a talented director, I had extremely high expectations and was a little disappointed.  I guess I have to take into account the fact that it is based on a true story.  Overall, this was a good movie.  I just didn't find it enthralling and found some of the scenes a bit long.",6,0,3,26 December 2003
Minority Report," Brilliant work by Speilberg
","This movie is absolutely terrific.  The story is worthy of applause.  The thought of precrime and the associating technologies is very interesting. Speilberg also does a good job in depicting this futuristic world where people travel in their auto-pilot supercars and are bombarded with video ads everywhere.  In addition to all this technological brilliance, the movie has deep emotions and a touching story.  This movie is a must-see.",10,1,2,11 December 2003
Spider-Man 2," Another awesome sequel!
","After Shrek 2 ended all comparisons to its original, Spiderman 2 is a fantastic movie that has a double dose of all the great ingredients that made the first Spiderman a great film.  Everyone probably knows by now that the action scenes Are perfectly executed.  I'm still trying to figure out how they shot some of them.  There is a bigger, badder, and extremely more powerful villain as Dr. Octavius holds the 'power of the sun in the palm of his hand.'  I liked the ending of the sequel much more than the first.  It didn't seem to leave you hanging as much.  Despite being a comic-book hero action film, the movie has its emotional/romantic scenes, which are much better than the ones in the first film.  From what it seems, there's definitely going to be quite a few Spiderman flicks in the future!",8,0,1,21 July 2004
Finding Nemo," Disney's comeback!
","After a string of flicks that weren't able to lure me into the theaters or the movie store, I heard great things about Finding Nemo.  They were right! Disney has come back with a great movie.  The emotions and adult appeal that were lacking in the recent flicks was very present in Finding Nemo.  The special relationship between father and son has been depicted very lovingly. It was hilarious to see how marine biology had been incorporated in this movie to make all the jokes.  It was funny how the aquatic life were shown as having a human lifestyle.",6,0,2,23 January 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Errors, plot holes, loopholes galore - did it send the message?
","I mean, come on. I won't accept gigantic random blocks of ice as hail, and for goodness sake, how on earth did that crazy ship make sharp 90-degree turns through Manhattan's skyscrapers?!?! The list is endless, and this movie has become more of a joke than its source of intended entertainment. One could spend forever eyeing and listing errors, so I won't even bother. It seemed the makers of this movie were too concerned in using their work as a scare tactic to frighten the people into being more environmentally friendly rather than illustrating convincing facts. I guess the only question left to be asked is, Was the film an effective means to educate people about the consequences of global warming and persuade them to stop it? The answer is quite debatable. I personally think it has not made much of an effect on the daily human behaviors contributing to global warming. However, all the hype and hoopla surrounding this film did instill these frightening images in the back of everyone's minds. Today, with grass growing in Antarctica, snow in Dubai, and above all, the series of disastrous 2005 US hurricanes, particularly Katrina, people at least pause for a minute to wonder, Could this be because of global warming?",3,1,2,15 October 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," What story?
","I barely understood the first two of the trilogy series, and I think it is safe to say that I got lost in the third one.  What I did get is that there is not much of a story in this one.  The whole movie is pretty much the war. I enjoyed the action sequence in Reloaded, but this one just dragged on and on.  I was sick of seeing two million of those machine things floating all around the place, and then watching two million Agent Smiths all over the place.  The first two Matrixes were definitely much better.",2,0,0,15 November 2003
"I, Robot"," Excellent film that beautifies the human spirit
","I was expecting this to be just a really cool action film with awesome special effects, but this film has plenty more to offer. It's an extremely interesting movie that, apart from clearly illustrating how man cannot depend solely on machines, explores the definition of life. Sunny, an MS-5, had been programmed to have emotions. Why would anyone want a robot to have emotions? How can this robot be beneficial to society? Another interesting question that arises is does Sunny have a soul? Does he deserve to be treated with as much respect as any another human being? The movie does a great job of answering all these questions. The central theme of the movie is that machine can never replace man.",9,0,1,13 February 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Excellent movie
","I really liked this Harry Potter.  Of course, I don't know how credible my review is considering I've read only the first book and haven't seen the second movie.  Nontheless, I found this movie very fascinating.  The story was very captivating and kept my eyes glued to the screen.  This was much darker than the first one (could be because of the new director).  There were a lot more special and visual effects.  I strongly disliked the new Dumbledore.  He seemed like a cold-hearted, sly, cunning person compared to the warm, cozy, grandfather-like one in the first one.  Even though I haven't read the book, I still felt in a few places that something was missing and didn't make complete sense.  For example, I get why Harry saw 'his dad,' but I don't get why he saw the moose.",9,0,0,9 June 2004
Batman Begins," Great movie but Spiderman was better
","It's raining superheroes with Spiderman, Batman, and now Superman! As different as bat-phobia and web-oozing may be, the comparisons are inevitable. Batman is an awesome movie power-packed with the best action, stunts, and special effects that Hollywood has to offer. The main actor gives a great performance and is the perfect choice for this role. Batman's romantic interest also gives a good performance and has an interesting role. All in all, Batman is an awesome film. However, my main gripe about the film is that like over half of it is spent in designing Batman's costume, obtaining the Batmobile, and getting all the superhero accessories. I'm here to watch an action film, not a fashion show. Too much time is spent in showing Batman's background and childhood, explaining Gotham, etc. and the actual saving-the-day comes in much later. Personally, I think Spiderman is better in pretty much all the departments. It's a much more wholesome entertainer; it has more emotions. There are many more (and I think better) action sequences. Batman is a much darker and grimmer film. The only thing about Batman that I like more is that the actress has much more input into the movie and doesn't have a dumb role like that of Kirsten Dunst. Now that Batman's all ready to save Gotham, it looks like the sequel with Joker is going to be really awesome and much better!",6,0,1,10 August 2005
2012," Great edge-of-the-seat experience!
","A die-hard fan of natural disaster movies, I had been waiting for this one for months. You can't help but admit that all the publicity from the History and Discovery channels, astrology sites, and scientific journals added to the hype. Whether or not the events in the film are possible is a whole another debate, but as far as the watching experience goes, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat! Even an ever-so-slight, infinitely small chance of this being true in just three years is a chance big enough to make the audience anxious to see what happens in the next frame. The special effects make your eyes pop out. My favorite show of these effects occurs in one of the first scenes in California (the one in the trailers) where destruction of a city is shown. Falling skyscrapers, collapsing freeways, cars falling through the earth's crust--each pixel of the large, panoramic screen screams of havoc and destruction as the end of civilization approaches.Another aspect of this film I particularly liked is that it gives importance to the rest of the world outside of the U.S. Unlike previous movies with similar themes such as Independence Day, Armageddon, Deep Impact, etc., all disasters--natural or extraterrestrial--seem to have their eye focused on the U.S. 2012 doesn't abandon this practice completely with everything starting in California, but it definitely shows a shift in global awareness, which signals a positive trend for the future. This can also be seen with the movie's massive worldwide release on the same weekend.Of course, the unifying theme of disaster movies--perhaps the main reason I like them so much (along with adrenaline rush-inducing special effects!)--is it forces all people--rich or poor, black or white, young or old--to come together in an effort to survive.",10,3,14,22 November 2009
Shrek 2," Much better than the first!!!
","This movie was absolutely hilarious!!!  While the first one was great and had its funny parts, I was cracking up through the entire duration of the sequel!  The sequel was definitely tackled upon with a different attitude. It was much more of a parody than the first as there were numerous spoofs of Hollywood blockbusters and cliched scenes.  The characters had a lot more 'pazaaz' in them.  (Don't ask what that means.)  It had modern characters, attitudes, cultures, and even amenities in a kingdom 'far, far, away,' which was awesome.  This movie was geared more towards the adult audience.  I don't know if it's a good idea taking very little kids to watch this movie. This movie is a must-see!",10,1,2,31 May 2004
Avatar," Deep, impactive story that has been presented beautifully
","Avatar is an amazing film that shows the importance of peace, respect for other cultures, and care for the environment. The story may not be groundbreaking, but its setting and presentation makes wonders. We know the very similar story of Pocahontas, where a harmonious society was destroyed by the colonists. We know the story of the War on Terror ['We will fight terror with terror'] by an administration hungry for oil. Now, we see history repeating itself yet again, but this time on a foreign planet.There has been immense hype regarding the 3D effects. While they are good, this motion picture is not a Universal Studios attraction. I feel today's 3D effects are not eye-popping enough to lure audiences by itself. What they do, however, is further enhance the story and contribute to the realization that this horrific possibility can definitely occur. You feel as if you are in this foreign world and empathize more for the native population. Even though this movie occurs far in the future, the movie's theme needs to be applied today, where we see terror all around us, where we see Mother Earth responding to mankind's ignorance and attempts to dominate Her.Performances are great, and Horner's soundtrack is absolutely beautiful--a must have. Special effects are fantastic, and the new world and its creatures have been designed, built, and animated very creatively.",10,2,5,25 January 2010
Saw," All gore, no thrill
","This movie is absolutely disgusting! I heard that this movie is a real scare and edge-of-the-seat thriller. This movie is not scary at all. The only thrilling part was the scene where the girl had that crazy contraption on her head. Otherwise, this movie is just out-an-out a gore fare. Blood coming from here, blood coming from there, digging into another person's body--it's completely sick. The writers of this film are complete perverts! You need an extremely sick mind to come up with the torture tactics graphically shown in this movie. The violence is so grim and ghastly! I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in watching a movie where I constantly have to see blood splurting out from everywhere.",2,3,5,10 July 2005
WALL·E," Beautiful film
","Wall-e is a magnificent film that, through a comical, playful, and non-preaching tone, well communicates and illustrates how we humans are making the earth uninhabitable. Global warming, pollution, and high toxicity levels have forced all of mankind to exode to a space-station to continue civilization and our species. Ironically, it is through the people's desire/curiosity to return our home planet that the audience begins to learn and appreciate the value of our Mother Earth. Centuries may have passed, but the ever-present human qualities of sloth, greed, and corruption are just as evident on the space-station. It is very interesting to see how the soulless robots Wall-e and Eva rekindle the spirit of life.",8,2,4,23 October 2009
Shark Tale," Finding Nemo wannabe -- not even close!
","I was expecting this movie to be along the lines of Finding Nemo. (I mean, come on, another 3-D animated underwater film with talking fish. How different can it be?) Maybe you can blame my lack of imagination, but this movie crosses the limits on turning the sea world into a human world. Finding Nemo had an innocent environment with 'schools' of fish. Shark Tale had corruption, gangs, greed, seduction, a social hierarchy, racism, poverty, and even a Times Square. I'm sorry, but including all of these things in an animated children's film defeats the purpose of personifying the marina life. It's not like the story is unique either. It has the typical plot in a countless number of movies. This movie not only alienates the adult audience but conveys all the despicable aspects of our society to the kids.",4,1,6,16 February 2005
