Alien 3," Worse than Alien:Resurrection
","When Alien 3 came out, people were expecting great things, certainly not a return to the old slasher formula (and to make things worse, this one had an abysmal script and uninteresting, undeveloped prison stereotypes as characters), decreasing production value, effects quality, acting skills. The disappointment was crushing.But when Alien Resurrection came out, it was a sequel that went largely unnoticed because people had given up on this series, thanks to Alien 3. If anything, they expected another abomination, and when they got the expected result, the disappointment was much diminished.Alien Resurrection and Alien 3 were horrible movies, but A:R was far from being the huge letdown Alien 3 was. It was just another bad flick.Stay away from Alien 3. It's a terrible movie with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. They put out a so-called Assembly Edition a couple of years ago, but it offered no essential improvements. The movie is CONCEPTUALLY flawed, and can never be fixed by re-cutting.",1,107,116,13 March 2009
