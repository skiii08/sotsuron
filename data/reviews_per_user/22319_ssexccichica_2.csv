Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Without Jack Sparrow This Would Be On The Worst Movies Ever
","Captain Jack Sparrow is an amazing character, and he is the only one who makes this film bearable. The other characters were pointless and irritating, the plot never went anywhere and the world could have done without this movie. Long story short, this film is the most unguided, poorly entertaining and below average 2 and 1/2 hour thing you will ever see. There is NO point in this film. I am pretending this movie was never made and there are only 3 instalments in the POTC franchise. Wait for this movie to show up free on your t.v., only then will you not be disappointed.",3,5,10,22 May 2011
The Dark Knight," Unbelievably Amazing
","This film was by far one of the best action/superhero films ever created. The character of Batman in this film is without question the best superhero portrayed in any past marvel films. The plot has an excellent storyline that keeps you on edge from the first to last minute, and all the characters are well played and very believable. Also, the special effects of this film are outrageously stunning and breathtaking throughout the entire movie. Furthermore, Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar for his outstanding, incredible performance as the Joker, the best villain in any movie thus far created. This film is without doubt a must see that you will fall in love with the moment you watch it!!!!!",10,2,6,15 December 2008
