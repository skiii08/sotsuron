Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Blecchh!
","Let me guess, this is the greatest movie since Titanic.  Well, you know what? Titanic sucked too!  And for a lot of the same reasons.Strip away the special effects (yes the visuals were great, but the much ballyhooed sound did not come close to that of Saving Private Ryan) and you get an utter piece of crap.An immense waste of the talents of Liam Neeson, Ewan Mcgregor and Samuel Jackson.  Why doesn't George Lucas either learn to write dialogue or hire someone who can?Almost any Grade 7 student could have written this movie.  Jar Jar Binks and his whole race were an annoyance.  Darth Maul appeared only enough to find his way on to countless T-shirts and action figure aisles at Wal-Mart.  I think this is some kind of profit deal! (sarcasm).Sure, go see it.  Turn your brain off.  Enjoy it if you want to.  But don't ever try to tell me that this is a great movie.  You'd only be deluding yourself.Whew, I feel better now.",3,0,1,16 June 1999
