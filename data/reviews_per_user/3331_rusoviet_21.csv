Blade Runner 2049," The film had potential but sadly the script given to a fine....
","....ensemble of actors/actresses was 'wanting'. Mind you there was an intriguing plot line but it was strung out way too long chewing up precious minutes that could have been better served with better interaction amongst both protagonists and antagonists. I found Harrison Ford' 'Decker' poorly used and that entire final hour reeked of a director unable to have a more meaningful dialogue that would have made the final 3rd of the film worthy.Sad actually because the film had a solid start and, not a big Gosling fan, but Gosling was not the problem. The director let the intriguing start begin to meander into a slow moving slough (meaningless discussions with Robin Wright Lieut. Joshi) rather than explain much deeper the role played by the monster 'Niander Wallace' aka Jared Leto.This was the error. In fairness the director did have Leto discuss his dream of complaint 'slaves' and his demonic referral when he says 'We could storm Eden and retake her!'That was the remark that fleshed out who Niander Wallace is - Lucifer incarnate. Had the film focused more and delved deeper on how he came to consume the Tyrell Corp. and morph it into the empire it was and most importantly a deeper discussion of 'why' - this film could have been as good as the original.Acting was very very good I esp. was focused on 'Luv' aka Sylvia Hoeks. Sadly her talent was wasted in the scene as the vehicle fills with water. It was a waste of time consuming nearly 10 minutes and predictable.",7,2,4,24 May 2018
Stop-Loss," Well done as agitprop for the left....
","...i.e. surprise surprise suddenly as of January 2009 one does not find any films damning the effort in Iraq or anywhere since his majesty was inaugurated. I foolishly though this was a film about a boiler room on Wall Street - oh well next time dummy check it out first before you but it for $2.99 @ 7/11.The incessant introspection and 'angst' very heavily laden. The one thing that was true was the protagonist stating there was no declared war with which to justify use of troops. Absolutely right but again no such films since 'his nibs' took over the white house and even with the indiscriminate use of drones, there won't be.Lastly it could have been compressed into a 60 minute drama - I found the emotion boring I was fast forwarding to the final scene.",6,0,1,2 March 2013
A Star Is Born," She was xlnt....he was decent...
","...problem was we've all seen this script 3 times and we already know the ending save this version , as well as the last pathetic one, is 'hippie dippie' drug/alcohol fueled 'except', at least, there wasn't the 'progressive' idiocy agenda rammed down all out throats.Lady Gaga is such a talented singer and a truly beautiful female and Cooper was truly decent in his singing efforts....Sam Elliott was great...man I hate the left...I so truly hate how they have seized control of normal decorum.",6,0,1,13 July 2019
Wind River," A truly incredibly crafted American film and that needs to be emphasized...
","Director Taylor Sheridan reached deep into his mind to hold onto what makes us unique. A nation of such disparate backgrounds and yet when Cory Lambert (Jeremey Renner) comes upon the corpse of the raped girl he viscerally understands the monster that did this crime is indifferent towards any blowback. This is WY in 2017 and on a 'Federal Indian Reservation' to boot i.e. what could possibly happen to a perp in such an isolated place? 
Sheridan adapted Cormac McCarthy's novel 'No Country For Old Men' into a credible script for a 2+ hour film and did it masterfully. He also wrote both Sicario and Sicario 2. This I feel is his finest work because both 'Sicarios...esp. the 2nd one'...are rife with 2018 agenda driven politics. Wind River has none of that and even more it didn't have a 'romance' between 'Lambert' and Jane Banner (Elisabeth Olsen)...Sheridan understood what the fall out is per 'casual sex' as compared to a commitment.
See this film. It is a great film not because there are 'surprises' rather there is a revelation of reality that has nothing to do with some agenda driven script save respect and justice.
Lastly - there were no 'de rigeur' 'breetish actors/actresses...it was all Americans for this deep foray into what our nation is rather than a cast that, in their hearts, has np real connection to what makes us uniquely American.",10,0,4,6 July 2018
Black Mass," Excellent film far better than
","'The Departed' in every way in point of fact 'The Departed' was the hip post millenial version of 'Whitey Bulger.Depp should have gotten an AA for his performance and I say that knowing full well his lack of recent skill - this is a great performance as were all the attendant pieces esp. Julianne Nicholson and Joel Edgerton as the Connolly couple.There was nothing sentimental per Bulger - a foul human being from the get go -a loser and one committed to infecting all with his twisted psychopathic homicidal mind set.No cutsie sarcasm or 'insert the racist, ethnic or fag joke here' as Scorcese is want to do - rather a gritty dusty wind blown accounting by former associates and flunkies that did Whitey's bidding.A great film and Depp should be proud of his performance.The Departed had the hip: crew, music, director, sarcastic ridden script all of it. As time wears on that very Scorcese trait will sink it below 'Black Mass'.",9,0,1,19 March 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," An unecssary 2+ hours of horrific language as well as...
","....nearly every white man depicted as: racist, indifferent, weak and in Harrelson's case suicidal. Not one black character had anything but the usual 'To Kill A Mockingbird' cardboard cut outs of 'insight' and 'honesty'.Had that been the only issues I had with the film I would have rolled with it but what was so galling was the use of such horrible language especially used by Harrelson in front of very young girls depicting his 'daughters' in the film - unconscionable is what that director and actors alike indulged in.McDormand is full of anger and rage that would have been far better directed at herself - she lost her bum husband, her daughter wanted to move out...she thinks nothing of indulging in violence be it verbal or arson. She was not someone I had any real connection to save for the tragedy that befell her daughter....i.e. it would be hell to have her for a mother or wife in any instance.The actions by the character played by Sam Rockwell are not even credible in 2017.....throwing someone out of a 2nd story window after physically wrecking that perosn's business - what is this Bull Connors and 1963?The smaltzy ending as he and McDormand begin their trek to ID to possibly mete out justice on an alleged rapist was too hard to believe...buds now.",1,5,7,26 March 2018
The Aviator," Been a while since it was released - sad to say...
",...it has not 'aged' well. DeCaprio gives a decent performance but the scenes reminded me of Beatty's mess 'Reds'. Ex. the scene in the nightclub with Jude Law (Errol Flynn) acting foolish - there was no editing to a script from scene to scene.,2,0,0,25 April 2020
Bridge of Spies," It reminded me of a 'Hallmark Classic' then again most of....
","...Spielberg's films do.Even allowing for the time (1957/62) difference (2014), the scenes reminded me of a 'stage set' - faux walls, sky etc.. In addition the award to Rylance wasn't warranted. His script was nearly a monotone and always let Spielberg make a bolshevik/red 'human'.The historic accuracy re. the second 'captive' 'Pryor', was false - another 'trick' by Spielberg to 'add' some human/family hook.A far better script would have added after successfully negotiating the exchange for Francis Gary Powers, Donovan's negotiated the freedom of initially 1,103 but expanded to 9,703 Cuban anti-Castro men women and children.With Spielberg, as with all Hollywood leftists, there is always the kid glove treatment of the horror of the reds, even allowing for the callous machine gunning of the fleeing East Germans over the wall. In Schindler's List, Spielberg made sure he got his anti-gun message in the final scene when the Jews are surrounded by the German SS guards and tell them (the Germans) to go. In the movie no one has firearms in reality the Jews did and had them pointed at the Germans.",5,3,5,13 March 2016
Inside Out," The film got a 8+ because in the first 12 minutes.....
","....voila the heroine, upon arriving in San Francisco, has the GLBT seal of approval, aka the 'de rigeur' long-T multi-colored Jessie Jacksonska 'mo fo' acceptance attire. Even allowing for that it wasn't long before the film meandered into 'Esalen' idiocy and bluntly this mess is an agenda driven film.Boring - the animation was 'cheap' almost close to the Hanna Barbera crud of some 50 years ago - not well drawn Compare it to a great cartoon film 'Wreck It Ralph' - no agenda, no corny 'angst' a great film filled with classic one liners and actors that bring a smile to every single scene.",1,140,299,23 January 2016
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Ever noticed a perv is always 'exalted' as they are demonize....
",...by 'fascists'? The film was interesting at first but it slowly oozed into a mess due to a poor script that stilted any energy in the story. It wanted so much to be a adult version of say 'Alice In Wonderland' but the choice of roles and the numerous cameos (concierges) added to the repetitive poor attempt at humor. Nothing really dark here more of a boring tale that left the talent of a great ensemble elsewhere.The director gave us an 'All Star Team' of the Americans vs. the Euros (heavily stroked with de rigueur 'Brits').Do what I did - go to your local public library and borrow it - a loss of 90 minutes with a cutesy plot that goes no where.,3,3,6,20 February 2016
The Favourite," My sole issue with the film is what so much of the 21st Century's...
",.....'offer' of what is 'culture'. I am not that old to know few women used the 'f' word some 30+ years ago. Now it is 'de rigeur' in any 'cutting edge' drama. While that may seem 'ok' in the good ole' 'boys/girls' bull sessions I find it unconscionable that a director would permit use of that word by a women attending to the British monarch in that very palace at the beginning of the 18th Century.It is a bit slow and the ending offers a meandering 'settlement' of sorts. All three females leads are excellent but use of that word....said more than once in said scene....is what makes this a '6'.,6,0,2,30 November 2019
Legend," Hardy and Browning were great but the film was a waste of time.
",I got in to just over an hour and whatever heft the film attempted to show was sucked dry by a director (Helgeland) trying to be Tarantino. The use of the 1960's American jazz and soul sounded more like Jackie Brown than Swinging London. The gay brother's perversion as well as the old fruit who indulged in the same was proof positive the director/screenwriter hadn't much original material to begin with.It is surprising considering his body of work - the sets looked like they were all shot inside a studio instead out doors.,3,1,2,20 March 2018
Get Out," Great film!
",The 'alarm bell' rang when he Chris first drives onto the property of the girl friend and sees a black gardener and a scene later there is a black female housekeeper. In 2018 I know of no one anywhere that has African-American servants in any capacity save for 'maybe' a chauffeur. You could see Chris himself see 'know' this was strange at best.It was a nice surprise seeing the elitist left as the villains instead of the usual 'White Republican Trump' supporter. It was also to see the authenticity with said 'progressives' choice of foul language in their conversing with one another.Great film see it,9,0,3,9 July 2018
Amadeus," I have never understood why this film garnered the accolades it did.
",I was assuming this would be a study of the composer that was focused on his music - instead what I got was 'Animal House' antics by the main character - Mozart. It seems this film was from the 1970's directors mindset of Altman or Mazursky....if a critical insightful scene can be turned into slapstick then full speed ahead. As another reviewer stated save for F. Murray Abraham there wasn't another actor or actress worth a darn in this mess..Mozart was a genius and also had deep faith as noted by his final compositions - you'd never know it by this pathetic biopic just as the powers that be omitted in their biopic of Dutch Shultz in 'Billy Bathgate' his (Schultz) pleading to have someone get him a Catholic Priest to baptize and hear his confession before he died in Newark-NJ. His wish was fulfilled but Hollywood made sure that troubling fact wasn't included.,1,7,13,3 January 2019
The Last Samurai," White bread height challenged 'ganjin' saves Nippon?
","This is another in a long line of white bread saving others from themselves. Last one that stank this much was Costner in 'Dances With Wolves' Cruise gives a decent performance if he is not allowed to 'direct' i.e. attempt to be 6 feet tall by acting 'tough'. Michael Mann's brilliant 'Collateral'. Kubrick's last full effort 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Barry Levinson's 'Rainman', and Pollack's 'The Firm' but that is counter slammed by drek courtesy of directors in it for the money or unable to rein in shorty - This piece of nonsense along with: Top Gun, Mission Impossibles, far and Away, Days Of Thunder, Born on JFK's (4th of July) Grave, Losing It, 'Cocktail' well frankly this was a film right up shorty's alley and oh yeah almost forgot he playing Stauffenberg in 'Valkyrie' - short guy wants to be a mensch.This film was a pathetic mess with the 'de rigeur' natives standing back in awe as dwarf white bread has 'had enough' and lashes out against oppression.Funniest scene was watching Cruise as 'Lego Boy' and the poor Japanese girl having to stand behind him (not too close i.e. she has to be Nicole Kidman and wear flats or stand in a hollowed out box lest she bluntly show dwarf boy he is a dwarf.This is such an awful film truly awful and perfect for Scientology hero Tommie.",Null,0,0,8 January 2011
Sicario," Great acting and an engaging plot 'but'....
",....the Emily/Kate character had to be a female 'because' no male worth is salt would have ever acted as she did and the writer knew it.As such her role was meaningless save for a sounding board for explaining scene changes and plot direction.Del Turo's last statement to her was what America is fast becoming. A nation absorbing millions that have little to no connection or loyalty to the USA. Understand if I were in their situation I'd be north bound in a second- regardless the protagonists were and are the good guys (Brolin et. al.) and idiots like the 'democratic progressive purist' is the problem.The left in America is no different than ISIS save they don't have the guns loaded yet.,8,0,2,31 March 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," Another, in a long line of, comedic treatments of the 'reds'...
",".....and their talons into the heart of America. The Nazis were graphically demonstrably monsters but the 'reds' why they're just a group of misguided fools and after all, didn't we need them to win the war?Clooney was the 'seller' - the typical libtard elitist putz - contrast his 'angst' in the 'days of Trump' with his blunt desire to 'mow down' those 'Africans' outside his 'manse' on Lake Como.Sometime try doing what? I know a 'treatment' of how MNorrie Rysking, Zazu Pitts and Adolphe Menjou were 'banned' by Dore Schary at MGM...you know the 'flip side' of those saints of the left...'The Hollywood Ten'.Lenin was a born coward and a reptile...Stalin was a stooge for the Okhrana and Felix Dzershinsky was the patron saint of Poland...'No one killed as many Russians as he did!'",2,0,2,4 August 2019
Inception," What a convoluted mess this is.....
","...this is what 'Matrix' on steroids? I didn't finish watching this overrated pile of nonsense as the 'soap opera' subplot made what ever ending was planned impossible to care about.Never ending 'staccato' of guns shooting in: Tibet, Paris, Los Angeles (passing for NYC), in cars, out of cars, in buildings - on and on.Worse was the wife of DiCapprio - if one is going to write a story make it engaging.I have to say the more I 'see' 'heavies' assaulting the public through brawls, shootings, threats - the more it looks like a short career choice based on declining ability and brains. True actors actresses understand the ubiquitous chase scenes and shoot em' ups are filler because a script can't be coherently portrayed. I lost interest after one hour and pulled the disc before hour two was about to begin.",2,10,17,17 January 2011
Kingsman: The Secret Service," It was entertaining for the first 2 hours but then took a hard turn to
","the left. The scene where Firth descends and proceeds to wipe out all the congregants at the rural church in KY was rife with all the 'left coast' totems. In particular were gay marriage and abortion. Of the two it was the abortion issue that was the worst.Imagine a bunch of impressionable kids going down to the movie theater and suddenly having this propaganda that, regardless of the extreme absurdity of the script, it's meritorious to kill pro-life advocates - I can assure you that was the intent of both the director/writer Martin Vaughn and the co-writer Jane Goldman.It never ceases to amaze me those who advocate this barbarity (abortion) never ask themselves where they would be had their mother elected to abort them - no that's never in the discussion.Firth must need the money or he's another lost soul heading for an eternity of eternal regret. Even sadder was watching Michael Caine who in the original 'Alfie', which he starred in way back in 1966, at that pivotal scene he (Caine) comes face-to-face what he has forced upon his girl friend Gilda, played by Julia Foster, an abortion and the honesty in Caien's/Alfie's face as he considers the evil of the act.Now it's fast forward to 2014 a mere 48 years later and oh man is Michael Caine cool as a cucumber in this mess.",2,2,4,20 August 2017
The Thin Red Line," Decent flick (contains spoilers) the 'speeches'....
","...became weirder and weirder. Sean Penn turns in a very good performance as all do in this film. The problem is periodic 'reflections' engaged in by a number of the actors. The most egregious was when Penn begins a spiel to a soldier early on in the movie was almost court martialed for being AWOL. He's given one more chance as a stretcher bearer and, in that effort, after a brutal failed counter-attack by the Japanese, Penn begins to lecture him on the meaningless of: war, life, etc..What is galling is that you would never see this speech in any film up against the Nazis because for libs that's the only war that ever should have been fought.Mallick had better get off his back side and produce more films because his skill set is wanting - he's still resting on 'Days Of Heaven' and the 'JD Salinger' recluse act is a stretch.",5,1,4,4 July 2012
Spectre," What's with the animus? Decent film
",especially Christopher Walz as Blofeld.The film was full of over the top action but it also had a decent plot - too bad they didn't tie the 'overlook' to the current occupant of the White House - funny how whenever a 'dem' is on the throne can't ever mock the president - only when a GOP is and that's been tough sledding these past 7+ years for all of us but I digress.At least we weren't subject to the fruitopian agenda '....oh understand my need...' and that idiocy - no it was just a kick butt old school escape film. Would have liked to have seen 'C' hang for a while more but alas '...poor Yorick ... I knew him well.' The French girl was special and deliciously good looking.Maybe next time they'll have that clown Bill Ayers as the antagonist along with all his merry pranksters a jumpin' and a jivin' to the new world order.All of us know the world is sliding into a police state - yeah that anti-Christ be out there somewhere jus a waiting' to take charge but hey no one died in Benghazi 'cause a 'dem' was in charge - whenever it's a 'dem' - nuthin' ever wrong - nuthin'....and wonder why Trump is a risin'....still wunderin' fools?,7,0,2,20 March 2016
