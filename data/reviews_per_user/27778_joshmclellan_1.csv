Sucker Punch," Very rushed
","5/10 strictly for the effects. The movie tries to be a not so deep Inception. The character development just wasn't there. 3 realities happening simultaneously is a good idea on paper for Snyder but it just doesn't resonate properly in Suckerpunch. I saw this in IMAX and wished I had have waited for a bigger better flick. The acting is sub par. If you literally shut your brain off for 2 hours and just enjoy the crazy set pieces and pretty ladies, you can make it through it. The best scene in the entire film was the first fight scene and it's basically downhill from there. and complete lame ass ending. Not for chicks either, my girlfriend and didn't have even a overall good IMAX experience. It was just Bah.",5,0,3,8 June 2011
