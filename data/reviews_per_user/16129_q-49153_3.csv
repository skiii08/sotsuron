The Ring," Don't take my opinion I laugh at horror movies all the time
","It's not the movie's fault for me not being scared, it's that I'm just not scarable anymore. THe coreogrophy is good, the build up is great and you would be scared. BUT. THe script is bad and corny and generic, not all the acting is bad but some is and whenever the movie tries to scare me I just end up laughing.4/10 great comedy",4,0,4,28 March 2017
Moana," This Movie is one of the most stupid,generic,unfunny movies I've seen in a long time
","I hate this Movie. Ironnicly,as I was walking up the stairs and into my seat, I had HIGH expectations. As I sat down excitement and the movie began...I hated the first few minutes. A few minites later added to the fire of my already burning hatred for it. Add 1 hour and 47 mins to that and I'm already clawing my eyes out. I'm gonna make this sweet and short. I felt like I was watching Frozen all over again, just with even more horrendous singing and somehow an even worse script. None of the jokes made me laugh, the best character in the whole movie was the chicken with the only trait as a character is being stupid and vulnerable and the only reason I didn't leave theatre was because it was new year's eve and I had nothing else to do. Can I say this?... This movie sucks..4/20(2/10)",2,33,74,28 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," One of the most boring exepirences from watching a movie
","I can't right much... it's just so forgettable...Okay, from what I remember, I remember just sitting down on my seat and waiting for the movie to begin. 5 minutes into the movie, boring scene of Tony Stark just talking to his 'dead' friends saying it's his fault. 10 minutes in: Boring scene of Ultron and Jarvis having robot space battles(I dunno:/). 15 minutes in: I leave the theatre.2nd attempt at watching it: I fall asleep. What woke me up is the next movie on Netflix when the movie was over.Bottemline: It's boring...10/10 because I'm a Marvel Fanboy",1,3,7,28 March 2017
