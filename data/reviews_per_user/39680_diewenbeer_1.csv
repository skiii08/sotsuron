Black Swan," This Film Broke Me
","It took just about everything I had to watch this. Very few are able to translate the profundity of the human experience in a way the people involved in Black Swan have just done. I'm unable to console myself knowing the reality this film portrayed. Black Swan transcended cinema's cathartic potential, producing an anguishing authenticity in a medium so fundamentally impersonal as film most often is to me. Black Swan is a bitter taste of the darkness I witness around me, which makes it so unrelentingly sublime. I'm hurt, and in tears. Black Swan is dreadful. It's beautiful. I hope I never have to see anything like it again.",9,3,5,11 February 2011
