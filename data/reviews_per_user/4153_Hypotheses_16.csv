Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Force That Wasn't
","I went into Phantom wanting to judge this film more lightly than I usually would, but there are just too many glaring flaws in construction:(1) obvious and flat in the entire Tatooine thread(2) uninspired action sequences--e.g., pod race (Ben Hur did it much better), droid shoot outs, closing battle w/ Gungans(3) an interesting but labyrinthine political thread(4) choppy editing (refer to Qui Gon Jin-Darth Maul showdown (which I _did_ like))(5) lifeless and unconvincing character acting (with Neeson being the _only_ exception)(6) an appalling attempt to demystify the Force(7) blatant story retreads from ROTJ--e.g., (7a) Princess in white giving an award to the heroes, (7b) space battle won with two torpedoes; (7c) seemingly overmatched battle between 'savage' natives and a technologically-advanced opposing force, (7d) the insufferable Jar-Jar Binks' equivalency to Ewoks, (7e) a vanquished enemy flailing down a (seemingly) bottomless pit, etc.)(8) a weak presence of Evil (Palpatine is not made significant; Darth Maul is barely present)(9)not to mention a story that stops cold in the theatre three times.With all of that, I simply could not give Phantom more than a 'C+', and could not imagine any adult (who sees this film) being any less forgiving. To put it plainly, I found TPM neither fun nor up to snuff.",5,0,1,3 June 1999
Unbreakable," So Much for the Hype
","Unbreakable  7/10<11/27/00> I expected to rate Bounce and Unbreakable just the opposite of how I actually ended up rating them. I thought that Bounce would be this straight 'chick flick', which it was, but amazingly enough it still turned out to be decently entertaining. With Unbreakable, my expectations were way too high. The trailers, which showed the audience virtually nothing, had me eagerly anticipating something dark and mysterious, but what I got instead was slightly less than adequate schlock. I am not saying that Unbreakable was horrible; in fact, it was far from it and I would see it again. It's clearly a movie for comic book lovers, which I am, BTW, but that doesn't negate basic film analysis. It just wasn't invigorating when it clearly needed to be, had a lack of basic momentum, was too concerned with odd camera angles, wasn't very thought-provoking, and concluded with yet another cheap, gimmicky ending a la The Sixth Sense that doesn't work. That said, I still liked the film. It was brooding and dark, Twilight Zone like. Too bad general audiences will probably bad-mouth it to their friends for certain.
Still, worth a repeat viewing. 7/10",7,0,0,19 November 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Children, can you say Brilliant Satire?
","FAIR WARNING: Southpark contains over 340 obscenities, racial slights a-plenty, sacrilegous material, graphic sexual content and violence, and enough satire to make Swift raise an eye brow. Tell me that you've seen this movie! (It certainly picked me up after that abysmal EPISODE I.) If you love the show, just believe me when I say that you'll literally choke with laughter during the film. It's easily the best comedy I've seen so far this year. If I had to describe this film in two words 'Brilliant Satire' would effortlessly come to mind.My only real concern is that half of the audience will probably miss the satire and especially the film's overall important message against censorship and intolerance. That is exactly why this raunchy film should not be seen by children. (It's rated 'R' anyway.) The only thing that the kiddies will come away with is a warped-mind full of profanity. Adults, on the other hand, will be either too busy laughing at or being appalled by Southpark's nastiness, which is fine, but to do so at the exclusion of getting the point is an insult to the brutal satiric genius of this work. That said, Southpark is not for the squeamish, religious, easily offended, those impenetrable to satire--who could easily be part of the former--and especially not for young children under 17 years-old.Quibbles: Other than exploding the brains of unsuspecting children who see this film, and they _will_ see this film (not unlike the boys of the film itself!), despite being explicitly prohibited, South Park is maybe ten minutes too long. I'm sorry, but after about twenty minutes, small, rotund, and badly-animated characters spewing expletives gets ever so old, which is exactly why the movie needed either more satire or simply _had_ to be shorter. -------8/10",8,0,0,8 December 1999

Cast Away," Third act fails the movie
","CAST AWAY --01/13/01It's a great Hanks performance vehicle ruined by a seemingly tacked-on conclusion. The film could have ended with Hanks' character being either rescued or Zemeckis could have shown us those conveniently missing four weeks. Those alone could have been a movie within themselves. But all in all, I enjoyed my time with the film. Serious film-goers will note that one beach scene _obviously_ gives a nod to Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, Hanks' self-professed favorite movie and mine as well. 7.5/10",8,0,0,24 October 2001
Being John Malkovich," Exquisite Madness
","Foregoing my usual three-paragraph summation, all I can say is WOW! 'Being John Malkovich' is exquisitely controlled madness. This film has several layers of discussion-worthy material beyond that of even Fight Club! Being John Malkovich waxes hypnotic on personal identity, celebrity, control, and so much more in so completely an original and entertaining manner, that its skill somewhat masks the sad and depressing conclusions it makes. Come Hollywood pageant time, if the Academy does not nominate this for film for the Oscar, complete and utter cynicism has yet another reason for being.-----9/10 stars",10,0,1,22 November 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Kung-Fu Theatre, but with Heart
","CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON--01/13/01This Year's BestCROUCHING TIGER is the most satisfying movie I've seen in years! It is definitely on my TOP TEN LIST for 2000. I honestly haven't been this affected by a film since QUILLS, BOYS DON'T CRY, MAGNOLIA, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, FIGHT CLUB, or THE MATRIX. CROUCHING TIGER's not just incredible gut wrenching eye-popping action, but two tender love stories that made me tear up, especially at the film's end. Go see CROUCHING TIGER now. Believe me, you will be clamoring to talk to someone, anyone, about it. I am. I just it saw one-hour ago. 9.8/10",9,0,0,24 October 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Completely Laughable
","M.I.2-- 05/29/00I must say this for all of you who loved the first MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, please _do not_ waste your time with MI2. Believe you me, if you have any usable brain cells at all, you will find this film slow, slight on content, and unintentionally--I hope--hilarious (as far as the action sequences of the third act go). I mean, come on, the glowing, pearly white dove was ridiculous! The female co-star spent the entire film in career enhancing close-ups and slow motion. And the chicken scene on the motorcycles was laugh out loud funny. My friend had to hold his head down in shame once the movie was over, but I did not tease him. There was no way in the world that he could have known the depths of stupidity and hokiness that MI2 would go.
Was directoral control taken away from the Great John Woo or what? I most certainly enjoyed his THE BIG HIT (7/10) more, yet I did not even think that that was all the good either. But at least THE BIG HIT in no way took itself seriously. I found MI2 to be so obviously bad that I was ready to leave after the first ten minutes (and I never walkout on films).

From Hell," FROM HELL, Yeah right.
","FROM HELL  6/10 THESE COMMENTS CONTAIN SPOILERS. PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW SPECIFICS ABOUT THE FILMFROM HELL was better than say SLEEPY HOLLOW, but that isn't saying much. Like that other film, this was all style and no substance. What is the point of having a pretty picture when it means absolutely nothing to the viewer? This oft-told tale needs something fresh to get a jaded, *UH-HUM*, experienced viewer, such as myself interested. The Hughes brothers went to obsessive-compulsive lengths to get the historical details of the murders right and to create a unique Gothic sense of 19th century London, but they did so at the cost of involving the audience with an actual story. I don't mind the fictitious elements, in fact, I welcome them, because despite what is known about the Ripper murders, a lot remains a mystery. But what I cannot stand is the conspicuousness of someone like Heather Graham in this kind of film, much like Milla Jovovich in THE MESSENGER. I simply could not get over the incongruities of Graham's perfect white teeth and statuesque body with the absolute wretched squalor of her environs and prostitute friends. My other technical quibbles have to do with the directors themselves. Specifically, I'll certainly be glad when the Hughes brothers mature, because right now (through either naiveté or insecurity), they feel the need to use every camera shot they ever learned in film school to show how clever they are. All of that gets old very quickly.
As for the story itself, like I said, nothing new or interesting is presented in FROM HELL. The choice of the Ripper is anybody's guess and frankly does not matter. (Although, I have to admit that making the Ripper a Mason was certainly fresh and different.) The relationship between the Inspector (Johnny Depp) and Graham is surprisingly rushed, cliché, and truncated. And finally, this film just isn't gory or scary. Maybe that one's just a horrible reflection upon me or the times in which we live, but MTV-like flashes of blood and horror do not register well with me.In all, I found FROM HELL to be well-made but nothing more than that. It was certainly worth the $4.50 I paid but I strongly recommend not paying more than that.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Enchanting
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone I've never read the Harry Potter books and probably never will. But as for the movie, I found it surprisingly good. I certainly didn't expect much from Chris Columbus, the director of Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire, but his version of Harry Potter is quite a success. I must admit, however, that Columbus could hardly foul things up because the film contains about two-thirds of the book, much of Rowling's dialogue verbatim, and brilliant casting.The over 153-minute running time of the film is a result of Chris Columbus' slavish faithfulness to book. But don't misunderstand me; I barely felt it. In the opening scenes with Harry's horrible stepfamily, the pacing is a little slow, and so I did start to worry. But that was for naught. The first third of the movie is actually a kind respite doled out to those, like me, who haven't read the book. Rather, this film later hustles and bustles along at an action film's pace. (One critic, referring to the action and look of the film, called it a kind of Indiana Jones for kids.)
That leads me to one of my few quibbles with Harry Potter. I urgently wish the film had slowed down a bit more. By the film's end, I doubt that much of the non-fan audience was aware that one year had passed on screen, had it not been announced by one of the characters. Yes, we receive important visual cues, such as the jack o' lanterns for October and the snow and Christmas trees for winter, but signaling the passage of time in a film is not merely limited to those sorts of things. It's a minor point nonetheless.All the way through, I didn't feel like I was watching a painfully dreadful kid's film. Instead, I got something that was thoroughly entertaining for both adults and children. Mainly, what worked for me was the completeness of Rowling's world. It seemed as though every possible detail of her imaginary world was fully realized to point that I was convinced--within the confines of the movie theatre, of course--that Harry Potter's magical world was real--more than mere make believe. Frankly, I was enchanted.
This kind of film, of course, relies heavily on special effects. They, unfortunately, were only adequate at best. In these days of Jurassic Park realism, the bar of what's acceptable is now amazingly high. But no matter.Besides a well thought out story, Harry Potter has a wonderful cast. Of course, the excellence of the Who's Who British cast of celebrities (the adults) is a given. But the emphasis of the story is on a trio of unknowns who did a damn good job. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are superb together. Their chemistry is just right. My only worry about these three, as they stand atop a billion dollar empire, is what torture they'll have to endure while make-up and costuming try their darnedest to keep these pubes looking like innocent--well, on second thought, not-so-innocent--young wizards for at least another couple films.In all, I was surprised to no end. While shaky at first, the film showed itself to be a clear winner. Worth seeing a second time.9/10",9,0,0,19 November 2001
The Iron Giant," Surprisingly Wonderful
","THE IRON GIANT-- 11/26/99THE IRON GIANT was a total surprise. I usually skip animation at the theatre, but I made an exception on this one and I am glad that I did. I would even go so far as to put this film in my Top 10 list for 1999.
THE IRON GIANT not only had a positive message, but was funny and heart-warming too. As a guy who is totally at odds with the unduly graphic, formulaic, impersonal and dumbed-down movies of this era, it was a unique experience for me to walk out of a movie feeling good about what I just saw. For example, although FIGHT CLUB (8.5/10) is easily one of the top five movies of the year, I must admit that I did not feel particularly good when I left the theatre that day. Shocked is the word that comes to mind, but 'good' is not one of them. After thinking over the films I had seen so far this year, not unsurprisingly, almost none of them made me feel good. Oh, I may have been intellectually stimulated, but was I encased in a field of positive energy? No. If you want a big, warm fuzzy, this film, THE IRON GIANT, is certainly the one to watch.8/10",8,1,1,24 October 2001
The Matrix," I say--without hyperbole--that 'The Matrix' is the best action/sci-fi film so far this year.
","I say--without hyperbole--that 'The Matrix' is the best action/sci-fi film this year so far. Roger Ebert can kiss my proverbial a@#$! for not making his review strong enough, because I was not convinced at the time. Of course, the film has its flaws, which I will point out later, but overriding that is the film's complete ambush to the senses. I knew, for example, that once Trinity flew into the window of that building from the roof of another with such dazzling SFX accuracy, that I was going to enjoy the film with or without lousy acting.Although critically, the Wachowski brothers' previous film 'Bound' is wholly of more merit, 'Matrix' delivers for its genre. You simply check your brain at the door, let the deluge begin, and pick it back up when the lights go up. Combining, to various degrees, good acting (many exceptions), intense action, and a terrific sci-fi/fantasy story, 'The Matrix' has secured a place for itself among some of the more truly satisfying action/sci-fi films, such as Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Blade Runner, Dark City, Total Recall, GATTACA, Back to the Future, Star Wars Trilogy, X-files: Fight the Future, Aliens, Men in Black, Eve of Destruction, The Puppet Masters, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn and so on. Moreover, although the special effects are key, there must be balance. One need only remember failures such as Waterworld, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, The Postman, Virus, Starship Troopers (Sorry, I read the book), Lost in Space, Deep Rising, Johnny Mnemonic, Vitruosity and so on to know this.The brilliant special effects and action sequences carry the film, but to its detriment are cartoon characters, the trite (and almost comical) aphorisms with Biblical overtones from Morpheus, the weak lead Keanu, a truly promising story line that is never really fulfilled or elaborated upon, i.e., there is no third act, and the film's clear avoidance of the serious question that Cypher, Joe Pantaliano's character, raises. Aside from that, the effects and other elements work well to balance out these flaws.The plot, although not completely original--see Dark City--is quite surreal, dark, pulpy, and most comic book-like. There are some literate allusions to Alice in Wonderland such as follow the white rabbit and through the looking glass, but also to the Bible. Neo, for instance, is a weak Christ-like character whose name is an anagram for 'One.' Morpheus rearranges into 'Push Rome' and Agent Smith into 'I'm the Angst.' And, characters with names such as Trinity and Apoc are obvious enough. In addition, the two worlds in the film make a striking contrast. The wholly bleached, grim, and gothic city seems almost idyllic when compared with the graphic and hellish 'real world.' Nonetheless, the Gestapo agents of the Matrix practically steal the show. Hugo Weaving's ominous portrayal of Agent Smith is outright superb character acting. Last, but not least, Keanu's marital arts are unintentionally hilarious. I know you laughed, come on now.Yet, even after you combine this hodgepodge of elements, 'The Matrix' will still leave you thoroughly entertained--as much as any rollercoaster ride, but for a lot less money.",8,0,0,3 June 1999
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Lackluster
","O Brother, Where Art Thou? 6.5/10I didn't laugh out loud once. The Coen brothers should've went back to the drawing board on this one. Or, perhaps, they should have actually READ Homer's Odyssey rather than Cliff Notes, or not relied on it at all. The whole acknowledgement to Homer is just insulting. The characters were simply too weird even for a Coen brothers film. How many blind men were there? Three or four? While I admit that Clooney had the best dialogue, he was simply too handsome--or out of place--for this film. I wanted to laugh whenever he went into one of those pseudo-intellectual riffs, but I couldn't. Something was wrong about them. (The film tried to explain it away later--Everett went up for practicing law w/o a license--but I wasn't convinced. That was just way too convenient storywise.)
The only genuine thing I saw in all of O Brother was the Klan scene. When it came, I couldn't believe it. I was right at the edge of thunderous laughter, but after 2/3rds of squat, just I couldn't do it. I did, however, rewind the scene. It's probably the only thing I'll remember about the film. I'm not counting the backward trio's engaging song 'I'm a Man in Sorrow', though. While I certainly liked it, it was an obvious plot device at its introduction. Everything felt haphazard, truncated, predictable. I just couldn't get into it, which is unusual, because I'm a Coen Brother's fan. So, I don't think it was me. They (the Coen Brothers) were simply off the mark this time. Go see Blood Simple or Fargo instead. 6.5/10",6,0,2,19 November 2001
