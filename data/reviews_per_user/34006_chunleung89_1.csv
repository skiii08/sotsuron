Come and See," It is a movie that reflect the ugliest side of War
","Come and see is a tragedy movie filling with a gray tone both on the screen and the story. Via Florya and Glasha's sad experience, Elem has given audience the ruthlessness and impacts of war addressed on the Jews in WWII.To me, the relationship between Florya and Glasha is meaningless to the story because of Florya's reaction looks like there is no struggle in his when losing his love. In the movie, Florya's has been dreaming as a warrior. He met his love at the beginning of the movie. Perhaps, that relationship is not very deep. This movie, in the middle point, has created a weird feeling that Florya seem never ever hesitated to leave his love to fight back Nazi after he was under attack at the warehouse.The most impressive scene in the movie would be the burning warehouse. It shifted my anger the most via the scene showing the cruel of the Nazi army. Burning people, torturing, and raping the women have angered me. Couple with the applause and laugh after the warehouse was fully burned, the scene has greatly expressed the ugly, cruel, and the truth side of the Nazi or war. I got to admit I even was inspired to trying to get into the screen and beat them with my hands.As those soldiers were caught up at the end, they were all blaming each other and finding excuse even they all know what they have done was really wrong. The action that one of the soldiers poured the oil he was given to his teammates has impressed me the ugliness of war and immorality within those soldiers. As we are told long ago that war has no wrong or right. This movie, however, is seem giving out a message to mirror a phenomenon that war is ugly and wrong when people don't respect lives.",9,1,1,5 June 2012
