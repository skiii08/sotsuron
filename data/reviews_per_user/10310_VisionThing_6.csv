Blade Runner 2049," Visually gorgeous, emotionally bleak
","For a modern big budget film, this one was OK. However, it failed to evoke any feelings whatsoever. Dissection below.Good things first. The movie is visually brilliant. It is believably rough and dirty where it needs to be, and stunningly beautiful when the story allows more artful scenes. There are some good acting performances (Harrison Ford, Dave Bautista (!), Barkhad Abdi). The basic plot is OK, one could build a very good movie around it. I very much liked how the movie handled the theme of relationships and contemplated to what extent AI could replace a physical partner. And the direct references and links to the original Blade Runner movie were very clever and graceful, they did not feel like fan service at all but natural and integral parts of this movie.Why did it fail to evoke any emotions, then? (Disclaimer: most of the reasons are probably due to personal preferences, very subjective. Your experience may be completely different.) One issue was the editing and pacing of the film. Pacing worked very well in the beginning, but the flow was lost somewhere in the middle, and the latter half of the movie was stagnant on several occasions, losing its grip of the viewer as a result. There were also a couple of occasions where despite the tranquil pace the movie failed to present key plot developments in a clear manner -- what exactly happened, why something was done, or how did we end up in this situation from the end of the last related scene. Second issue was a combination of casting and screen writing. Ryan Gosling is a solid actor, but perhaps best suited to sympathetic heartthrob roles; in my opinion he lacks the kind of rugged charisma and screen presence that would be needed for playing this kind of role with such vast screen time. However, the role is extremely challenging -- to function as a focal point of the whole movie he should be identifiable, charismatic, memorable; on the other hand he should convincingly portray a machine without a free will whose job is to kill his own kind. Gosling makes a brave effort, but the end result is bland. The antagonists are simply trite. Jared Leto is miscast, stale at best and atrocious at worst; instead of a menacing, wildly ambitious genius he comes off as a fledgling cult leader who is practicing his first sermons. However, the actor was not given much to work with, the whole character is but a dim imitation of Dr. Eldon Tyrell from the first Blade Runner movie. Sylvia Hoeks does a good job with what she was given, but again, it was not much: the writers resorted to the cheapest B movie trope and imply that the bad guys are bad by making them use violence as the first and only solution to every problem, and Hoeks' character was not given any nuances apart from a sadistic streak that seems odd in a machine.Finally, there was the soundscape of the movie. This film is practically devoid of emotional music. Sounds consist mostly of thunderous rumbles and shrill synth sounds instead of real melodies; there is also a Shepard tone playing during one key scene. Absence of emotionally manipulative soundtrack is often nothing but a positive thing, but it also means that the movie has one less tool to convey and evoke feelings with. In this case, the drab and monotonous score enhances all the wrong qualities of the film.3/5",6,6,14,8 October 2017
The Beach," Even more boring than beaches usually
","This is one of the least interesting films I have never seen. The plot is astonishingly uninspired: a half-witted attempt to modernize childrens' adventure stories for today's teenagers, with a hasty twist pilfer from the Lord of the Flies and the most cumbersomely laid out love triangle in movie history. All characters in the movie are not only one-dimensional, but that dimension consists solely of being an utterly unlikable monkey. And pray tell, what possible purpose the stale narrator's voice is supposed serve?I would say that the first half of the movie was majestetically boring, although that leaves me no means of describing the second half, and my only positive thought considering this picture was 'thank God I never saw this at the movies'. But hey, that's only because my image of paradise does not consist of pot, beach and Leonardo DiCaprio acting out his second least ambitious role, so obviously I am not this film's target audience. 2/10",2,1,5,9 February 2004
Van Helsing," Brainless anti-fun
","I was told beforehand that this movie sucks big time. I did not believe. 'Hey, it's a summer movie -- it's not supposed to be a timeless classic, but just some brainless fun you can eat your popcorns by,' I thought. 'It has a promising leading duo and a lot of monsters, so how bad can it be?' Well, the answer turned out to be: utter crap. Two major problems: the script is awful (which should not surprise anyone, and this alone would not trouble this sort of movie at all), and the cast is horrible. Two notable exceptions are Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale: Jackman is a fine choice for the leading role, but he is not given much to work with, and Beckinsale looks nice and spicy, but she's given nothing else to do. They also seem to have absolutely no chemistry between them. The rest of the cast is so recklessly awful you'd be hard pressed to find such lack of talent in the most backward theatre of the planet.Richard Roxburgh is the worst Dracula ever, by a margin the size of the moon. Apparently his vision was that Dracula became such a loathed figure because of his loud-mouthed, goofy manners. He is a complete failure, as the performance is stupid, annoying as hell, and yet not at all funny. And it gets worse: both Kevin J. O'Connor as Igor and Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein's monster do their very best to top Roxburgh in a half-witted noisy overacting contest. AND they all are outplayed by Dracula's brides, who hiss, make faces and screech like rabid wombats.There is nothing entertaining. There is nothing scary. There is nothing funny. There is just a lot of pointless CGI and an abundance of annoyingly bad performances. This is not brainless fun, this is just brainless.3/10 (P.S. Oh, and the score which some people here seem to claim makes this movie. If you have seen more than 20 movies, you have practically heard this soundtrack, only probably a better version of it. The score is nothing else but an uninspired two-a-penny variation of the most clichéd string arrangements for spectacle-type movies. It does in no way break the film -- it is probably the closest call to a proper element this movie has -- but most definitely it also does not make this film.)",3,0,2,13 October 2005
Frozen," Could have been much better
","There are many much more thought out reviews that say the same, so just a brief summary. I'm a 35+ guy. I still love many Disney and other animated 'kids'' movies that I get to watch, they are often much better and thoroughly thought out than 'normal' movies and usually have food for thought & gags for adults as well. Frozen had promise as well, but there were weak developments throughout and the big plot twist and everything after it were insulting to a viewer's intelligence.White became black, because the plot required it. Death was revoked with no explanations,because the resolution required it. It is pretty to look at and I even did like the songs, but targeting younger audience should not be an excuse for blatantly subpar story-telling.",5,6,7,3 February 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," 90 minutes too long
","The fights are truly excellent (if you happen to dig near-realistic, ultra-violent, gore-packed screen fighting with some tasteful stylistic effects), as are the parts directly preceding the fights and the whole beginning of the movie. All in all, about 20-25 minutes.The rest of the 111 minutes consists of some lousy humor and a lot of dragging scenes as a result of awesomely bad scripting, naturally iced with Tarantino's trademarks, chapters and non-linear timeline (this time actually adding very little to the film besides the nice beginning). Animation episode is a very nice touch, but terribly realized (unimaginatively clichéd & ugly art).Most of the casting is quite satisfactory, with few excellent choices and a highly average lead. Although Uma Thurman handles the action parts very well, she just lacks the edge and presence to be anywhere near believable in her ample bravado, thus underlining the B-movie feeling of this film in an unfavorable way -- a truly charismatic lead might have been able to make the (purposefully) corny lines both hilarious and impressive, but her efforts fall flat.If you want to see ultra-violent fighting and enough blood to engulf Tokyo, watch Shogun Assassin or any other movie Tarantino (tastefully) has taken his inspiration from. The plentiful mediocre and plain bad aspects of this film easily counter and knock out the worthy fighting moments (although you might want to check them out on some medium that allows you to skip right to the beef).",4,4,8,23 October 2003
"Girl, Interrupted"," Quality movie
","'Girl, interrupted' boasts a strong script, extremely competent cast and a very believable 60's setting. It is undeniably what an uninspired critic would call a quality movie. Yet it somehow manages to come out boring -- quite an extraordinary accomplishment. Oh, and there's Whoopi Goldberg, whose female saint impersonation I just cannot bare to watch for a single second after seeing it ruin a hundred and somety movies. Pathological typecasting, if you ask me, so don't. On a bonus side, there's Angelina Jolie and a few truly memorable scenes. Plus some serious food for thoughts; 'crazy is you and me amplified', indeed.",7,1,1,9 February 2003
