The Avengers," Avengers is near excellent
","First of, make sure to see it in 2D not 3D, nice sharp picture in the lovely 2D, all thanks to digital at my Cineworld, this Thursday, not sure why us Brits get this and Battleship ahead of you.Out of the 30 plus films I've seen this year, I really enjoyed this that much that might see it again! A sheer joy from star to finish, and it's very, very funny too, which is good, and very much needed.I'm being vague as I don't want to say anything but see this film, does not matter if you like super heroes or comics, it's just plain fun.The acting, story and script by all is top, and a great villain, which really carries the film. Look forward to Amazing Spiderman now.",9,9,19,26 April 2012
Sucker Punch," simple fun cinema
","Thank the stars this was not 3d otherwise I would not of seen it, and it would of been crap 3d anyway.The story is simple, but it's the journey and how it's told is something else, quite different, very visual. Worth seeing in the cinema, yes, as this will not have the same impact on the small screen.The action is frenetic and brutal in places, and on whole, it's worth the trip as at least it's not a bloomin' sequel. Source Code is out too, see both together as it covers similar ground with the mind and how our particular hero / heroine views the world and how they deal with life and death, and refusing to bow down to who ever and whatever stands in their way.My only problem again is Sucker Punch and Source Code need a wee bit more character story and like and extra 10 minutes on them both.",8,2,6,7 April 2011
Iron Man 2," Good follow up, good characters, good fun
","First of, make sure you stay after the credits, again. Second, this seems to be a very wordy film.Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke have great dialogue and Don Cheadle replacing Terrance Howard is on form too, you get great action and great performances from all, a very good second film, but one more and that is it, at least you can see what is going on, unlike Transformers.You often wonder how they can do a next film after the first Iron Man was so good, well at least they handled the two main villains a lot better than I expected. Action is much harder than the last one, so try and get a digital showing, I saw at Vue in London on the 29 of April, so the crowd was small, no kids.An interesting super hero film, wait for third film to compare them all.",8,4,14,30 April 2010
Star Trek Into Darkness," Good Space Fun
","Another movie that the UK got ahead of the US, fine by us here, but it's another movie ruined by the fruitless needless 3D sh+t and p=ss, (not spit and polish). All of 6 people I saw went to the showing to the 3Dumb version, 2d, full house, I can see Iorn Man 3 and this doing 200 million easy, but not 300 million, because of this.The film itself, loads of fun, just too much bright lights on the command desk of the Enterprise, Benedict Cumberbatch lights up the film, and is very calm and collected in his role. Zoe Saldana, needed a bit more in reflection as Alice Eve took up the slack for the lack of female screen time in this.Next film, female villain please, no Earth, set way out exploring so they meet some new danger, like 4 legs and 4 arm lifeforms, no more humanoid crap. Action with fixing, jumping and science, not blasting and crashing, two films of that is enough.",8,4,14,14 May 2013
Suicide Squad," Good fun and the horror...
","First of, this film is good, it's been a long time when my local was packed for a first screen of a movie, and also no one walked out, so it's worth a look, the rating is high because of the elements of horror, yes, I say horror, it feels and looks like one, along with some great action, jokes.There is character development in this, but there could of been more with extra time, it's a David Ayer film with a difference, no police for one thing, and no swearing.It's all good, but the music is annoying, but it does work within the context of the film.Worth a look in the cinema.",7,1,3,7 August 2016
Tangled," The Disney 50th is brilliant
","As always I saw the non 3d, and I easily found cinemas in London showing it non 3d, so this was my next film on my list as Green Hornet is nowhere to be found in London but in sod 3d, guess that is why it is struggling at the box office and Tangled made a load off cash in America, lesson, make film available in 2d with loads of prints (no to so called 3d, full stop.) Tangled as you well know marks Disney Animation's 50 animated film, and the print I saw was beautiful, nice rich colours and dark blacks. This is just a lovely looking film visually and the story is fun and action from start to finish, minimum songs, 3 I think, were used rightly and not too long.Character design for all, but mainly for Rapunzel, her hair deserves praise. The film's colours are akin to Sleeping Beauty with lots of greens and warm reds. Voice cast is perfect, Mandy Moore should do more Disney work after this.I enjoyed this as much as Toy Story 3 and if this is up for an Oscar, I really do want it to win, as I like it more than Toy Story.My only moan is did it really cost $180 million to make??",9,2,5,5 February 2011
Oblivion," Story is king.
","This is a good solid film, just don't understand why people are not going to see this, it's good stuff, great set pieces, good acting, story is paced and flows good, top notch acting and production all round. Guess it's all Iron Man and Trek, bad timing, people saving up for these two movies, well, see them, and go see this.It takes it's time to get where has to go, which is fine, Tom Cruise, Andrea Riseborough is lovely here, and is quite excellent with Olga Kurylenko who is the opposite, a very emotional character, Morgan Freeman must of had quite a bit of fun here, and looks way cool, it builds up to the final reveal in the last acts of the film.A simple film in a way, and at least it's not ruined by 3D crap. Have a watch, worse films out there and on the way...",7,1,2,14 May 2013
Man of Steel," Very good, well made fun
","To be sure, the story on this, has been worked on, hard, forget Superman on film, TV, comic and animation, as this is very different, in a good way. Fist off, in the UK this film gets a 12a rated film, and to be sure, when this gets the blu-ray treatment in the UK, it's going to be a 15 rated and people will have to buy an imported version as I can see cuts, the action is brutal! death on large scale! The handling of Clark Kent's human and alien parents is pretty much damn good, I just wish there was a bit more on them. Also a tad bit more on the alien home worlds, see a bit more off it. Russell Crowe is splendid and fights good too, as is all the acting talent in the film, which is expected from the team of the last 3 Batman films. It looks all good, plays out fast considering the run time, so toilet break first, and don't drink anything.The 2D showing was totally packed, so grab them good seats early. A good film, no idea yet on how they will handle another Superman film, which I'm sure there will be. Look out for the Akira reference scene.",9,1,4,14 June 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," rewarding screen time
","In England, this came out July 3, so my local 2d screening of this was near full, 9 seats left. It's worth a look, not in 3d of course, but it's much better than the last Spiderman 3.Andrew Garfield is a much better Peter Parker, looking and acting much closer to the Steve Ditko classic Parker. Emma Stone is charming, and looks good as a blonde, she wears these horrid boots though! The movie is very different from the Sam Rami trio, which were top entertainment, but as a first movie, this is better. The action shots of web swinging, over head shots mood good, not tight in a certain scene with the excellent Martin Sheen, which could of been handled much better story wise, that needed more time, and the movie was quite on the short side, again, 5 to 7 minutes more to flesh out the family side of things would of sorted this out, that is my only problem with this film, just a bit short.Just why it cost $200 million is anybody's guess, but it's worth your time seeing this.",8,1,4,5 July 2012
Kick-Ass," very silly, very violent but very good
","I read the graphic novel and wondered how this would flesh out on the big screen, and it works very well, a lot more funnier than than the comic, which I didn't expect, plus the dark humour works well, for a super hero action film in this, which is rare, only Hancock managed too pull this off.At least it's not as bloody and violent as the comic itself, which is worth a read, get the hardback version. One of the films of the year as it's so crazy but it works. The costumes are accurate, simple and not really unbelievable, and plenty of guns, and weapons the like that Batman would never use.What makes this are the performances, Nicholas Cage is brilliant, his dry wit makes his character memorable, Mark Strong is topper too. We have Iron Man 2 and Prince of Persia, game to movie adaptations up next.",8,3,13,28 March 2010
Avatar," Avatar- non 3d 35mm showing
","I travelled down to the cinema the early hours of today to see the regular non 3d showing of this film. First of all, see this film, one of the best this year, and I have seen about 80 films. The actors are put through their paces by James Cameron, as always and it shows with performances which are excellent,course it looks too.Along with the story of, You forget where you are in this film, a mix of Pocahontas, The New World, but set in the future and on another planet instead of America discovered by the Conquistadors. My only disappointment is why the regular showing was not digital, is beyond me. See this film, it is a joy to seeing this.As for 3d, I went to a preview two months ago and saw the 3d trailer, which was 15 minutes, 7 minutes in, I took the damn 3d glasses of and just watched it's funny colours, but at least I could make out what was happening as appose to the crap so called 3d. No thank you, I have no idea why anyone could think a 1 year old's crayon scrawl put on screen on this or any other film could be worth sitting through or paying RAPE cinema prices for, avoid the 3d films!",9,5,11,17 December 2009
Inception," Best Nolan film, best film this year
","My favourite Chris Nolan film is still his first that I saw, Memento, but this tops all his films and anything that is out this year.It's not a sequel or remake, other that The Expendables, it's the only original film this summer. Try so pay for IMAX for this, even though I saw just a regular non digital print, which was fine, but for this, I am going to see it again, but in IMAX, it's that good.Anyone saying the story is hard to follow, well, it's not. Complex, yes, that means that it has been thought hard, and quite what research went into the story would be very interesting to find out about, save to say that since last year some research groups in American and Europe have created some prototype machines that read the electrical signals that the brain emit, so this sort of tech and new crime is really quite possible, which made me nervous while watching this film.Some years before, Avalon, by Mamoru Oshii, is quite similar too Inception, that is worth a look.In all, never listen to any hype, just see or do whatever you want to do, I was going to see Inception anyhow, it is worth your time. Anyone wanting to go into film screen writing should go.",9,3,7,21 July 2010
