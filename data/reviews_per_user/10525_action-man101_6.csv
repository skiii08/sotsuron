Skyfall," One of the Best
","Excellent. One of the best Bond films of the entire series. It captures the dark brooding brilliance of Casino Royale and marries it with the panache, humour and style of the Connery-era Bonds. Stunning pre-credit action sequence which is probably the best of all the 23 Bonds. Craig is better than ever as 007 and has truly made the role of Bond his own. Fans of the early Bond films will love certain homages which aren't forced but flow naturally into the story. Bardem is the best villain of the entire 23-film series, Judi Dench is brilliant as always as is Ben Wishaw as the new Q. Casino Royale is still my favourite but Skyfall is a close second, with Goldfinger third. The final 15 mins is just 007 heaven! ENJOY!",9,2,9,9 November 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," The Adventures of Bland Boy and his dog, Exposition.
","Dear oh dear, it seems loads of people were blown away by the film's impressive animation, and thus came away thinking it was a good film. I found it boring to say the least. I don't care how good the film looks, it was just filled with unfunny humour and exposition. My two stars are for the animation alone. It also had John Williams' worst score for a film - I had the feeling he couldn't have cared less about it. The poor script writing is what makes this film interminably dull - and we can thank Steven Moffat for that. Anyone who's ever watched Doctor Who will know that Moffat loves his exposition. He just can't help but get characters waffle on about what's happening in the film, and what will happen if they don't stop the bad guy etc etc. The whole film felt like an ordeal that had to be overcome. How can so many talented people (not including Mr Moffat) have made such a bland film?",2,5,10,1 June 2012
Watchmen," Watchmen
","Based on the cult 80's graphic novel (comic book to you and me). This is one superhero flick that is definitely not for kids, hence its 18 rating. Re-invents the genre in a film that was widely believed to be unfilmable. Set in an alternate 1985, in which America won the Vietnam war and Richard Nixon is still President, it shows us a group of sad, depressed ex-superheros known as 'Watchmen' in a world that has abandoned them - because lets face it who needs a masked weirdo running around in spandex? There is a welcome change of pace from other comic book adaptations as the 'heroes' are shown to be very human. There are also moments of dark humour such as the prison scenes and the nostalgic opening showing other masked heroes and their eventual downfall. Unfortunately the film bites off more than it can chew but the main problem is that it gives us no one to root for. The Watchmen are more like a group of sociopaths who need locking up - in one case one of them shoots dead a pregnant woman!?! Another hurdle is that for the majority of the film there isn't even a villain for them to fight - at least until the final 20 mins (which stretches credibility) and the identity of the baddie is revealed to the surprise of no one. Billy Crudup's character of Dr. Manhattan who for some reason walks around the whole film stark naked is one of the dullest characters I've ever seen in a movie of this type. He looks like a member of the Blue Man Group who decided to stop performing with his chums and become a flasher. The film is around 45 mins too long as a result of non-linear writing which results in a lot of time wasting. Plus points are the demented Roarshack who steals every scene in his ever-changing ink blot mask, and the gorgeous Malik Akerman who is a dead-ringer for Lucy Lawless. But these are few and far between.",5,6,13,7 March 2009
Prometheus," It's Alien, Jim but not as we know it.
","Ridley Scott's Alien-prequel is like a Christmas present sitting under a tree. Attractively wrapped it promises to be the present you always wanted. But come Christmas morning as you begin to unwrap it, it quickly dawns on you that you haven't received the Playstation 3 you always wanted. Sure the box says it's a Playstation but once you open it, it turns out it's another knitted jumper from Grandma. As any fan of Alien will tell you, Prometheus concerns the large humanoid, or 'Space Jockey' seen at the beginning of that film. Ever since that memorable scene fans have wondered what it was and why it was there. Well, after watching Prometheus they're still wondering. This film probably sounded better when the producers discussed it around the production table. Sadly the end result simply doesn't work. There are too many needless characters, too much bad dialogue and not nearly enough thrills or suspense that Alien and Aliens gave us in spades. Poorly written, this mishmash of ideas turns out to be a sheep in wolf's clothing. The premise (I hesitate to use the word plot as there isn't really one) concerns an expedition to a faraway world to discover the possible origins of mankind. When our explorers reach the planet of LV-223 (not LV-426 featured in Alien and revisited in Aliens) they discover several large structures in a barren wasteland. It soon becomes apparent that the giant humanoids were our ancestors (surprise surprise) and the large structures are in fact alien vessels - the doughnut shaped ship from Alien being one of them. Our intrepid explorers find out they these humanoids were wiped out by some kind of biological weapon that they created and wished to destroy the Earth with. Soon things go down the tubes and, just like in Alien, there is only one female survivor. Why the giant humanoids were planning our destruction is not explained - though we can speculate, nor is the nature of the biological weapon, which appears to be a forerunner of the alien creature. In fact several things are not explained at all and all this does is leave you with a sense of disappointment. In fact it's no better or worse than the laughable Alien v Predator films. Michael Fassbender is amusing as an effeminate robot and Charlize Theron looks smoking hot as the ice-cool corporate suit from Weyland Industres. You'd be better of watching Stargate.",4,2,5,9 June 2012
Slumdog Millionaire," excellent!
","Uniquely original fable with charm to spare. The tale of a young Muslim man from the slums of Mumbai who wins 20m rupees on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire - and the story of how and why he knew the answers. Told mostly in flashback we are shown the young Jamal and his elder brother Salim, and how they seek to escape their poverty-stricken existence after the brutal killing of their mother at the hands of religious extremists. At the beginning of the film as Jamal is being tortured by the police ,who believe he cheated on the show, we are asked how does a 'slumdog' from Mumbai know all the answers? Slowly we are shown. For all those people who believe that India is a charming, mystical place full of awe and wonder, need to watch a film like this. Mumbai is shown to be the polluted, disgusting, corrupt-ridden sinkhole it is and the treatment of the street children is heartbreaking, even to a cynical sod like me. Many of the films best scenes are in the flashback sequences as Jamal, Salim and their young female companion, Latika, struggle to survive on the streets. The performances from the young actors who portray the main characters younger selves is astonishing and one forgets that we are watching actors (as its supposed to be in movies but often isn't). If Charles Dickens were alive today he would probably be writing something like this as many of the issues that were close to Dickens' heart (poverty, street crime, family, honour) are to be found here - there is even a Fagin character as well as the gang from Oliver Twist. It also has a Bollywood-style mass dance number as the icing on the cake. A must-see film. Note to Hollywood - please don't remake this.",8,0,4,21 January 2009
Valkyrie," The Cruiser vs The Fuhrer
","Well, its finally here. For ages now much of the press has rubbed their hands with glee as they looked forward to trashing this pet-project from the Cruiser. Cruise V Hitler after all had TURKEY written all over it. Even I had a laugh as I waited to see the wee man's attempt at appealing to the greater German public after they slammed Scientology and branded it a cult. That of course is another debate all together. On to the film. Its not nearly as bad as many people had hoped or expected, some of it is rather good in fact. From what I can tell it is historically accurate in its depiction of the failed Von Stauffenberg plot to assassinate the Fuhrer in July 1944. The recreation of Hitler's Wolf's Lair and the Berghof is picture-perfect and adds much realism to the film and the direction from X-Men's Bryan Singer keeps things nicely bubbling along. The film's biggest problem though is Tom Cruise as the aristocratic Claus Von Stauffenberg. He simply fails to pull it off and comes across as a cheesed off - dare I say it, 'Little Hitler.' The role needed to reflect the Bavarian Count should've gone to someone like Liam Neeson or perhaps Christian Bale. Strange and uncomfortable casting permeates this film: the presence of Eddie Izzard as a communications officer at the Wolf's Lair is totally out of place and much of the cast also fails to convince. The best performances come from the European actors ,Thomas Kretschmann, Christian Berkel and the gorgeous Carice Van Houten who was last seen dodging more Nazis in Black Book. Sadly not enough is seen from them as the British with Cruise in-tow take centre stage. If this film had been made by the people behind Downfall it could have been so much better and as is, it remains something of a missed opportunity (no pun intended).",6,3,7,24 January 2009
