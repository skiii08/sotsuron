Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not aged well...
","This is the perfect example of a film that has not aged well. The effects are now tragically bad. Even saying they have aged, I cannot be confident they were even particularly good when this was released. They are unsubtle and just painful. A lot of the character designs are also dreadful. Many exotic alien faces, looked almost as if they had been designed by a child, then animated by one.It was inevitable this trilogy had a high bar to even come close to the level of the originals, but I fail to believe it was undoable nor that this is the best they could have achieved. As a young child I can see how I found this thrilling. Lots of flashing lights. Several action sequences. And a big loud mess. I do not share the same opinion now.It is inexcusable quite how dull this entry to the franchise is. It tactically hides how boring this is, behind a many location swaps and several side plots. Many flashy action sequences are filtered in throughout to try maintain some level of interest, they work, but that's only due to the focus being reverted towards the out dated visual effects.After many rewatches, a certain gungan has finally drawn my patients thin, and I can finally join the Jar Jar Binks repulsion bandwagon. However, no characters can be as infuriating as every character encountered on Tattooine - especially Anakin's friends!The dialog is continuously stupid, cheesy and well, laughable. It is awful, and even with the dull plot and being completely underwhelming, the laughably poor script. So much of the dialog is actually completely frustrating, it is so sloppy and appears as if a 10 year old wrote it.",5,0,1,4 January 2019
Us," 2019 horror to beat
","This second outing for director Jordan Peele has taught me many important thing about this sophomore filmmaker. This man did not get lucky with 'Get Out', he is no one hit wonder. Peele could have easily signed his name onto the list of directors who make one acclaimed film and never recreated that success and followed with several weak films. This is in no means the case. Equally as importantly he is no one trick pony. This is no 'Get Out' repeat. These are two wonderfully different films. Both at polar opposite sides of the genre. I was almost hoping to narrow down Peele's style of filmmaking from this horror, but both outings are gloriously different and completely unique, I am still as clueless as I was before. Peele is swiftly forming himself into a true master of horror and he is here to stay, so if I was you, I would sit back and watch this master at work.There is a thin line on identifying whether 'Us' is a horror or a thriller, it heavily play into both genres and is a very strategical blend of the both. On one end, the thriller aspects of the film are executed perfectly. The story itself is ingenious, somewhat predictable and unsurprising, but so well written it doesn't matter. The horror aspects are strong, and this is one of the main features that makes this so different to Peele's 2017 hit. Tension is built on superbly, throughout the second and third act it is never dropped. It has the true edge of your seat, nerve shredding tension I so harshly craved from this. One aspect to the horror side of this story I truly adored was the hard slasher vibes littered throughout the second act, it almost felt like a more tense version of 'Scream'. I was in my element.Having such a reliance of slasher themes did mean the second act did rely on gore factor. The story did take a back seat for a large proportion of these scenes. This benefits the story wildly, by fitting so much in to the story within the first half and hour and the last half and hour, it allowed for a large section for Peele to go full horror on the story, and he goes wild but remains admirably sophisticated.Relentlessly the cinematography is breath-taking along with wonderful production values. A match made in heaven and undoubtably benefits this watch even further than its exemplary story. The visuals aided the sustained tension, by getting up close and personal with characters really forced the heart pounding pressure on the audience, each and every time you can feel exactly what the characters feel. Each scene is shot beyond perfection and without a question the least critique worthy element to this film. Some shots are highly inventive and the personal feeling that's conveyed due to this is gnarly and really gets under the skin.Peele provided such richly writer characters and each and every actor in this movie does a faultless job at executed their role. Surprisingly both the younger cast members (Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex) excel and give two of the best child performances in a horror in the last decade. Duke is wonderful and Moss is wonderful. The latter is unfortunately underused, but her character is perfectly utilised within the story. No matter how much praise is worthy for the other cast members, no one compared to Lupita Nyong'o. A powerhouse of a performance, she shines and glimmers with perfection, one of her two roles transcends despair and the other is nail bitingly intimidating, both roles are played so different, the talents of Nyong'o go undoubted and leaves you with endless desire to see her take on more roles like this. This is easily comparable to Toni Colette's performance in 'Hereditary', but much like that, unfortunately will most likely go unnoticed by all major award ceremonies.Comparisons to Peele's previous endeavour can't be helped, and on the most part could be the one thing that harms the reception, however, I can firmly state and in full awareness I will be in the minority, 'Us' has the edge over 'Get Out'. With nerve shredding tension, perfectly executed character and a doubtless conformation of the formidable talents of one Jordan Peele, this is the horror film to beat in 2019.",9,3,6,4 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Overwhelmingly underwhelming...
","It has to be said, this is the only Star Wars film that can be branded as bad. Because it is, it is such trash, not even just comparing the film to the remainder of the franchise, but as a stand alone film, it is still bad.With the low standard set out by the first entry in this trilogy you'd be forgiven to assume the franchise would get better, but as this displays it can always get worse. The Phantom Menace may not be bad, but it is poor. This however, is bad.The plot is inconsistent, and for the most part does not make any sense. Any nonsensical scenes involving this romance forming being Anakin and Padme, are truly ridiculous. It is cheesy and does not belong within a million miles of a Star Wars film. Whoever thought it was a good idea, could not have been more wrong. It is a franchise low. The dialog is cringe and continuously gains laughs for being so bad. Far too much detail is paid on Anakin not liking sand. I would argue that it where the film completely lost it.Much like the first, the special effect are poor and have not aged well. The character design remained poor. The effects did improve slightly with the addition of both the clone arm and battle droids however, scenes films in a studio and on a green screen were painfully obvious.Even the action sequences are dull. The final climax battle was uninteresting and led my mind to wonder constantly. No effort was made to gain my interest which subsequently led to this being the worst Star Wars film.",4,0,1,4 January 2019
The Favourite," Another notch on Lanthimos' bed post...
","The Favourite (2019), starting the year as I mean to go on.It's awkward when one of the first films released this year, turns out being on my top 20, last year 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' and this year apparently will be no different.Yorgos Lanthimos had created himself a hefty job to top either 'The Lobster' or 'The Killing Of A Sacred Deer', but he succeeds on all fronts making a deliciously hilarious and wildly unique experience (which will most likely go missed outside of the film community).As 'The Favourite' unfolds it reveals more than meets the eye. It is simply more than two people battling it out to win the affection of the Queen. Many subplots cause ripples in this story making a thoroughly enjoyable rollercoaster.I would be kidding myself if I said the strongest aspect to Lanthimos' newest feature wasn't himself. He continuously proves himself to be an outstanding director and a more than capable film maker. His films are always aggressively unique and feature admirable storytelling methods.The performances however cannot go unnoticed. I can finally release a huge sigh of relief as I can comfortably say Olivia Colman has finally managed to break onto the big screen with a leading role, which subsequently is one of her best. Her charm and wit does all the work and carries the film leaps and bounds. It goes without saying both Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, are nothing short than exceptional also. The two share remarkable chemistry. All three leads are entrancing and deserve all the praise they seem to be getting.The structure of this, is told in almost as set of chapters, to a book, which marvellously breaks up the film and allows the scenes to have tonal and pacing variations without making it seem messy.'The Favourite' may be the first film of the year, but it may also be one of the best. Good luck to 2019 on topping this.",10,6,12,3 January 2019
Hidden Figures," Inspiring...
","I'm disgusted its taken me over 2 years too see this.Hidden Figures is quite simply heart warming and full of joy. It isn't one of those feel good films which is bitter sweet with its message - it is pure happiness and relief in the point it is trying to convey.The inspiration women portrayed in this historical drama are played perfection by the leading ladies. Taraji P Henson's best performance, without a doubt
Out of the main three, her story is executed brilliantly and fully carried by Henson. Certainly Oscar winning deserving!It feels almost unnecessary to make any comments on either Octavia Spencer or Janelle Moane as they as both always captivating, of course, neither are any different here. A special mention must go to Kirsten Dunst, her screen time is limited, but her role is pivatol, Dunst manages to make an outstanding impression in the time she had, making an impression against the remarkable leads is certainly a win for her.Unlike many films similar to this, the story focuses on the central woman and their achievements, instead of focussing on the people who knocked them back. Solid script work allows some focus on those people but does not allow it to outshine the true meaning behind it. This is what gives it such an incredibly heart warming feel.As this is a film centering around NASA, it was inevitable space scenes would be featured, however, this high of quality effects was not expected. Firmly impressed on this front.It isn't perfect though, it is unfornante but on many occasions I found Jim Parson's to be utterly infuriating. I cannot conclude whether this was intentional or whether the matter of the fact is, Parson's is suited to the smaller screen, but it just did not work.",9,0,4,3 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best of three...
","It is unquestionable that this is the best entry in this trilogy. An accomplishment which most likely was not hard to achieve considering the first two were really, not great!Unlike the last two, this entry to the franchise does not have a laughably bad script, it is nothing spectacular and it does improve as the film progresses, but it is still significantly better than the first two. An emotional factor is aimed to be gained and it is obvious, subsequently failing, but it works much better than in the first two.A huge sigh of relief is made when it becomes clear it is not dull. It has boring sections, but without a doubt utilises action sequences and keeps a fast pace throughout. At times the action sequences felt like filler to make the film more enjoyable, but it works well.No section is more improved on than the disastrous visual effects, in the few year gap between this and episode 2, Fox managed to employ some decent animators, it was much needed and frankly could've used this level of animation through the trilogy or maybe the practical effects method used in the originals would've been the smarter move?There are tonal shifts through this movie and they are painfully obvious. Towards the end it does become extremely dark including mass genocide, but it is a vast improvement over the light hearted approach of episodes 1 and 2.Which generally sums out this film as a whole. It is significantly better than Fox's previous efforts, but still falls flat when compared to the originals.",7,2,2,4 January 2019
