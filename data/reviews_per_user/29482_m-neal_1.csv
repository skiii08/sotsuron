Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Greatest Movie Ever Made
","Anyone who has a drop of adventurous blood in their veins will love the non-stop, cliff-hanging, thrill-a-minute action in this heartpounding experience.  It has everything needed for a great movie: great script, great directing, and great acting.  Then combine the great special effects to bring to life the adventures of a sometimes mild-mannered, sometimes egocentric, sometimes romantic, but always ready-for-action hero we've come to know as Indiana Jones.This movie defined all others of it's kind.  It is the standard by which all other adventures are set.  From the opening scene, which jumps at you with action you don't expect, to the ending scene which leaves you wanting more, this movie has created a generation of fedora-wearing adventure seekers.It takes place over many continents, as Professor Indiana Jones is asked by the U.S. government to attempt to recover the Lost Ark of the Covenant before Hitler's minions can find it.  Then he is off and running, from location to location across the globe, to complete his quest.  Along the way he meets an old flame who can give as good as she gets.  She is the female equal to his male bravado, and one of the few things (other than a thousand year old golden idle) to turn his head.  Together they complete a matching set to rival the evils of his antagonists: the contemptuous archaeologist-rival from his past, and the Nazi foes who have their own reasons for wanting the treasure.Together, all these people make up a grand menagerie of characters bent on obtaining their prize, with Indy at the lead. They are the Raiders of the Lost Ark.",10,0,0,12 December 2001
