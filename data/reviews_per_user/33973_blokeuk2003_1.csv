Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill 1 and 2, poor movies but good for Asian movies being made available
","After spending my life watching Chinese and Japanese movies i feel that Quentin Tarantino has done the genre some good even though these two movies were very bad remakes, or should i say ' scene borrowing ' ever.I don't pretend to be a expert at movie knowledge, but come on people, what was so good about these movies? Tarantino has been stealing scenes and idea's from other Asian movies for years and getting the credit for his own movies. Don't get me wrong, i think that it is good that he is putting his name to the likes of ' Hero ' and helping these films reach a wider audience, but he does borrow scenes and story lines.I was really looking forward to ' Kill bill 1 and 2 ' but after watching them i mights as well of just watched ' The Lady Snowblood ' films instead. Same as ' Reservoir Dogs ' which Tarantino stole from ' City on fire '.I would of probably enjoyed these movies more if i had not seen a million Asian movies before hand, but i just felt a little robbed as there is too many comparisons to a lot of other movies.But on a positive note i do think that Tarantino has done the Asian film market some good and he does admit that he is a big fan of Asian movies, so i will forgive him, lol.",3,3,6,14 October 2005
