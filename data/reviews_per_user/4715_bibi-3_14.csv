Ghost," STUPID ARGUMENT
","I can't think about another movie that was more stupid than this one.I think that the only positive thing this movie has is the romantic song: Oh my love, my darling, I hunger for your touch..Demi was fantastic in that scene.",2,4,21,26 December 1998
As Good as It Gets," AS BAD AS YOU CAN IMAGINE !!
","I don't understand what people have liked so much about this movie.I recognize that Nicholson's performance was good ( although I disliked his character so much. He was a jerk ). ( BY THE WAY, IF YOU LIKE TO SEE STUPIDS IN A REALLY EXCELLENT MOVIE, YOU SHOULD SEE 'RAIN MAN'  OR 'FORREST GUMP'  'ACE VENTURA' OR 'LIAR LIAR'; THOSE ARE PRETTY GOOD MOVIES )The whole movie is very stupid. It's an unbelievable story ( who would like to live with a person like Udall. Could anybody call this relation: LOVE ? )Helen Hunt is terrible in this movie. I think that she won the Oscar only for showing her back when the guy made a picture of her.  ( KATE WINSLET WAS DEFINITELY THE BEST )Well, I think this is AS BAD AS IT GETS... A WASTE OF TIME !!I ended totally disappointed after watching it.",1,13,39,29 December 1998
Beauty and the Beast," BEST OF ALL DISNEY'S MOVIES
","I think this is the greatest movie of all times. I've seen it more than 10 times and never get tired of it.Beautiful music and unforgettable songs, excellent story and a terrific moral.It's my favorite Disney's movie.",10,0,0,27 January 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," STUPID
","I can't understand how such a stupid argument can be praised for lots of people.The special effects are good, but it is the only thing you can recognize in this nonsense movie.For me it is Garbage and a waste of time.",1,17,112,26 December 1998
Face_Off," BEST ACTION FILM
","This is the best action film I've seen till now. Great performances, specially liked Travolta's role. he is superb !!",10,2,3,1 January 1999
Legends of the Fall," GOOD MOVIE
","This is not the best I've seen, but it's pretty good. It has a very romantic music and the most beautiful scenary you can imagine ( Montana ).The story is very sad, specially for the enemisty between brothers, but I liked this movie a lot.",Null,1,5,29 December 1998
Good Will Hunting," I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE LIKED IT
",I think that the only good thing this movie has is Robin Williams' performance.This is such a boring movie !!,4,3,8,26 December 1998
The Graduate," DID I MISS SOMETHING ?
","When I saw this movie in the top the list, I can't but question: did I miss something ?I can't understand how a movie like this, featuring the moral decadence of a society is considered a 'classic'.A boy who just finished college is having an affair with the wife of his dad's partner, doing anything else for months, instead of trying to achieve a goal in his life.Then 'falls in love' with the daugther of that woman ( can you tell me how they could fall in love after what happened in the cabaret?  Did Elaine have a brain ?  Loving him after she knew he slept with her own mother ? Going to the altar with a man she doesn't love ?Is all this representative of something ? Yes, it represents the moral decay of a society.I think that the only valuable thing of this movie is the beautiful music and Hoffman's great acting.The rest is so naugthy !!",1,57,113,15 January 1999
Mission: Impossible," MISSED IT ? IMPOSSIBLE !!
",One of the best action thrillers I've seen.Tom Cruise is great in this movie. I also liked Vanessa Redgrave a lot.I'm anxiously waiting for the sequel.,9,1,2,1 January 1999
Titanic," BRILLIANT !!
","I think this is a movie for all times. Everything is perfect: the music, the actors, the visual effects, the story...Specially liked Kate Winslet's performance ( She should have won the Oscar, not Helen Hunt ).I also loved Gloria Stuart's role, she was really convincing and deserved the Oscar as well.The biggest injustice was against Leonardo Di Caprio, one of the greatest actors of these times ( I'm not a teen girl ) and he was superb in his role as Jack Dawson.I also liked very much Kathy Bates.The final scenes are touching. I think that you can't but cry as you think what happened that night, specially watching those freezed dead bodies in the sea.I've seen the movie 9 times and don't get tired of it.It's definitely a MASTERPIECE !!  Don't miss it !!",10,1,2,26 December 1998
The Lion King," IT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL MOVIE
","I think that it is one of the greatest Disney's movies af all time. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is the best of all, I think.I enjoyed the music, all the songs and most of the characters, specially Timon and the hyenas.The only thing I didn't like in this movie is the spiritism it carries in some scenes (like Simba talking to his dead father )But in spite of all, it's a great movie.",9,0,1,27 January 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," AN EXCELLENT MASTERPIECE !!
","Great music, superb actors. It is a pity that Forrest Gump (which I consider another masterpiece ) went out the same year and got all the publicity, as well as the Oscars. It was not fair.The only reason for which I rented this movie, two years ago, was because of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. But it was a big surprise to see one of the best films ever made. ( I have seen it 6 more times since then )It is a story of COURAGE, PERSEVERANCE, TRUE FRIENDSHIP, HOPE AND REDEMPTION.IT'S A MOVIE FOR ALL TIMES, A MEMORABLE ONE. EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE IT. YOÃš WON'T REGRET.",10,4,6,26 December 1998
The Deer Hunter," A GREAT MOVIE
","I still remember the first time I watched this movie, and can still feel the emotions I had at that time ( 8 years ago ).It is a great movie about true friendship and the terrible effects of war on the people.It has a sad ending, but it's worth to see it.I specially liked a lot the music. ( Cavatina is great )",9,0,0,1 January 1999
The Truman Show," The Andrew Nicol Show
","Because HE is the real 'brain' behind this movie. (Writer) It surely is a very original movie, but an Oscar? Come on!For me it was very boring most of the time, until the final scene, which I liked very, very much. It was brilliantly done.Jim Carrey is an excellent actor; the BEST comedian in the U.S.A. (and maybe the world ). Only for watching him I could tolerate this movie. I definitely liked much more Liar, Liar (and even The Mask or Ace Ventura). But this one was different, I have to admit it.My respect to the writer.",6,0,0,15 February 1999
