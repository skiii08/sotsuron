Casablanca," The film that has everything
","Casablanca contains everything a film should have: suspense, romance, humour (even comedy), observation, charged emotion, good music and most of all superb pacing, there isn't a wasted second. As each scene elides into the next bringing twists and turns you are caught up in the swirl of an ambiguous world where money may talk but personalities talk louder. Whose side is Rick on? Was he the first anti-hero or just Humphrey Bogart's stock in trade character? The ambiguity of Rick is reflected in many of the other roles notably the young bar-girl revealed as deeply patriotic when the chips are down - for me the most charged scene in the film.No matter how many times I watch this movie it's still as fresh as the first time and the possibility of the ending being different always present.",10,2,4,31 August 2005
Dunkirk," Confusing but exceptionally well executed.
","For anyone who does not know what happened in the early years of WWII this could well come across as an exceptionally well-crafted fictional period piece. There was a short text preamble that said British and French troops had been forced back to the coast by the enemy. No mention of when or why they were there, or even who the enemy were.The film certainly has bouts of dramatic tension, and there are the expected triumphs and tragedies. There being such little dialogue has created a visual and aural masterpiece. I wonder if a cut will be made that has all the dialogue removed just leaving the soundtrack and sound effects.There are 3 narrative threads: these are sometimes sequential, at other times they overlap and sometimes they jump back and forth in the time-line - quite confusing.There are some marvellous flying sequences and I particularly appreciated (to my layman's eye) the minimalist use of CGI.With the almost faultless attention to period detail that sets this film apart from many others set in WWII it was ruined by a glaring anachronism near the end when railway carriages of 1980s/90s vintage were used, complete with Formica tables and ghastly British Rail upholstery, and not a compartment to be seen anywhere, which I believe was the norm in 1940s.I had expected more from this film.",7,1,5,1 August 2017
