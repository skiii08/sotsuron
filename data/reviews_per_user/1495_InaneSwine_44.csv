Alien 3," Problematic production leads to a problematic film - the worst in the franchise
","Let me begin by congratulating David Fincher, director of this third instalment in the Alien franchise, for enduring what he did during this production. Alien 3 was his directorial debut, and he was given a massive $50 million budget to play with, in addition to having to live up to fans' expectations after the previous two marvellous films, Alien and Aliens, directed by Ridley Scott and the unsinkable James Cameron respectively. He had to start shooting without a script, and 20th Century Fox stuck their noses in the production so many times that I'm surprised he finished the film. But he did. And after all of that, the film turned out just as one would expect with all that going on – messy.While the first Alien film finishes with Ripley shooting off into space as the lone survivor, with an unknown future ahead of her, the second film shows Ripley accompanied by two other characters (and a damaged robot). Alien 3 had so much potential to capitalise on this, and utilise Hicks and Newt to a great extent, giving Ripley a family of companions to accompany her through her battle with the creatures and The Company. But no. They are callously killed off in the opening titles, with seldom time to mourn them. This is the film's first big mistake, and is guaranteed to leave Aliens fans a little peeved.The prison story is interesting enough, as Ripley is the lone woman on a barren prison planet full of deadly convicts. Moving on to Alien 3's next big mistake: the creature itself. Quite radically re-designed, this creature seems much less deadly than in previous films, exacerbated further by the tacky special effects. Having spent much of the first two films seeing very little of the creature, which builds fear and tension superbly, this film shows you a little too much, and one realises that the little Xenomorph isn't actually all that scary.Nonetheless, the film isn't an entire disaster. Sigourney Weaver gives a naturally excellent performance, along with the rest of the cast doing a fine job as well. Furthermore, the musical score in the film is, in my opinion, the best in the Alien franchise. (This is understandable, as composer Elliot Goldenthal was given an entire year alongside David Fincher to finish the score, as opposed to the six or so weeks given to James Horner for Aliens.) And, last but not least, the film's emotional final scene is very well written, with great performances all round. The scene could (and probably should) have given a satisfying conclusion to the franchise, before the nightmarish Alien: Resurrection.Overall, while the film makes the best out of a bad situation, the problems shine through, and there are far too many flaws in the film to consider it a classic. I wouldn't go so far as to say that Alien 3 and its sequel ruin the franchise, but they most certainly put a downer on it. Alien 3 is probably the worst film of the four. But it's alright, I guess.",5,0,5,8 April 2012
United 93," Exerts an electrifying sense of tension
","The first major film about the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, this unflinching drama sets a standard of excellence and integrity which any subsequent dramas are going to struggle to match.British director Paul Greengrass adopts a documentary-style approach to the story of United Airlines flight 93, the only plane that failed to reach its target during the attacks on New York And Washington.Many of the actual air traffic control and military staff appear as themselves, while the actors playing the crew and passengers aboard the aircraft will be unfamiliar faces. Once the plane is in the air, the film unfolds in real time, ticking down the seconds until disaster, and exerts an electrifying sense of tension, even though the outcome of events is in no doubt.",Null,1,2,12 May 2007
Dawn of the Dead," Scary, gory and fun
","It contains little character development, and ignores the social commentary provided by the original and instead focuses on creating an action flick. Nonetheless, in this respect, it works. It's scary, gory and fun; and its opening sequence is one of the best and most tense opening sequences of all time.",7,1,1,3 December 2017
Alien: Resurrection," A sad testament to the poor direction the series took
","Now just what in space is this carry-on? It's a good bit of fun, if you can excuse the abysmal script and acting from the majority of the cast, particularly Razzie dodger Winona Ryder. Yet, in spite of her now ludicrous character, Sigourney Weaver still puts on a damn good show. Controversially, I actually think this film slightly surpasses Alien 3. Or it's at least as bad as it. Unlike the third film, at least you can have a bit of fun watching this one. Gore galore, sleek alien effects and a few moments of well-crafted tension make it okay to sit through. Nonetheless, the film stands as an unfortunate joke - a sad testament to the poor direction the series took.",5,0,0,18 February 2016
Shaun of the Dead," The Best Zombie Movie Ever Made
","It may well be a one-joke movie, but this hysterical spoof of Dawn of the Dead manages to stretch that joke a very long way. Relocating the story to North London, it presents a lovelorn shop assistant (Simon Pegg) and his slovenly flatmate (Nick Frost) with the task of battling an invasion of cannibal zombies.Attempting to blend horror with comedy is no simple task, but director Edgar Wright keeps both the gore and the laughs flowing freely. If the film revels in its sheer goofiness - such as the moment two protagonists attempt to stop a shambling zombie by throwing vinyl records at it - it also has moments that verge on the sublime, such as one character's description of the living dead as 'Vacant, with a hint of sadness. Like a drunk who's lost a bet.' This film is not a gross-out spoof such as 'Scary Movie', but it will have you laughing, screaming and will keep you on the edge of your seat.",9,1,2,11 June 2005
The Babadook," A terrifying experience - Jennifer Kent hits the nail on the head
","Looking through some of my reviews for more recent horror films, I seem to react with genuine surprise whenever I come across one that I've actually enjoyed. And I think that's mainly due to the fact that almost all modern horror films are the same. They don't pay much thought to character development, story or drama, and are just concerned with forcing bigger screams from its audience and making them throw their popcorn higher and higher into the air. If people leave a cinema laughing about a horror film they just saw, it has failed to deliver. If they are quiet and exhausted, then it really has frightened its audience.The Babadook, first and foremost, is a terrifying experience. Not entirely because of its supernatural elements and the villainous entity, but because of the drama and tension surrounding the unstable family unit that Amelia and Samuel inhabit. Though a single parent raising an unmanageable child may be a well trodden premise, particularly in a horror story, it is compounded by an expertly written and heartfelt script, authentic performances - Essie Davis is outstanding - and a horrifying exploration of a parent's descent into madness, the kind not executed this well in horror films since The Shining.When the supernatural elements do emerge, the third act begins to falter slightly, and the melodrama of the dialogue threatens to encroach soap opera territory. But what chilled me to the bone was watching the mother - influenced by this evil being - chasing her son around their dilapidated house, hurting him and threatening him, and realising that this is how some children live their lives, without influence of the Babadook. I'm sure this was director/writer Jennifer Kent's intention, and she's absolutely hit the nail on the head.I never did like sleep much anyway.",8,5,9,20 February 2016
The Terminator," Terrifying - a cult classic
","The explosive sci-fi thriller that turned Arnold Schwarzenegger into a superstar is now acknowledged as a cult classic, but it's certainly worth remembering that it did only modest business at the box office. Nevertheless, big Arnie hasn't gone hungry since.The plot line of an unstoppable killer robot has become one of the most overused concepts in sci-fi cinema, but director James Cameron has imbued the film with plenty of wit and a relentless sense of pace. Even with today's standards, the make-up effects and the prosthetics are just as terrifyingly effective as they were in 1984. However, this is much more than the usual guns-blazing action B-movie: at the heart of the story lies a woman's reluctance to come to terms with what she must soon face, and the tragedy of a love that can never be.",10,2,3,8 June 2009
Final Destination 2," A clone of the original - but still fun
","This exact clone of the original 'Final Destination' is less of a sequel than a remake of it, with a bit more blood and gore thrown in. The plot has scarcely developed and the parts that have are too small to notice without watching it multiple times. Nevertheless, it is quite a fun splatter movie.It's exactly one year after the Flight 180 disaster, and when a teenage girl on the road has a premonition in which she, her friends and all the other drivers die in a huge pile-up, she blocks the road and saves a handful of people. But when the pile-up does occur, the survivors begin to be picked off, one by one Perhaps six out of ten is somewhat too generous, as this film lives purely on the first film's lustre. But it is a pretty fun ride from beginning to end, and worth the watch.",6,0,0,22 February 2006
Alien," A prelude to the far superior Aliens
","I completely understand how important this film is to the horror genre. Nonetheless, the film never particularly blew me away when I watched it for the first time, and it doesn't particularly now. Where it should be building tension, it just seems to drag on sometimes.Having said that, it really is terrifying at times. The third act of the film is so tense, so excellently shot and so well performed by Weaver. It is a well put together film with a great cast and a great creature, beautifully realised by H.R. Giger. Nevertheless, today, Alien feels to me as though it serves only as a prelude to the far superior Aliens.",8,0,2,18 February 2016
Predator," A great deal more thoughtful than most of Arnie's action movies
","Predator, when you sit down and think about it, is a great deal more thoughtful than most of Arnie's brainless, all guns blazing action movies. The film is less sympathetic towards its military protagonists. Rather, it shows them up. Juxtaposing Schwarzenegger and his fellow cast spending the first half of the film measuring each other's manhoods, we spend the film's climax with an excellently designed creature seemingly built for battle. While the Predator is born to fight, humanity chooses to. Ooh. That's probably a deeper analysis than the filmmakers ever intended. Aside from all that, it's loud, quite fun and it's got lovely violence all the way through.",6,0,1,18 February 2016
Nightcrawler," Exquisitely wrought thriller
","Jake Gyllenhaal's career has always been promising - his talent shining through as early as Donnie Darko and Brokeback Mountain (maybe not Day After Tomorrow). But it seems the last couple of years have really been his time to shine, with excellent performances in the awesome Prisoners, the bizarre Enemy, and now this exquisitely wrought thriller.The film works brilliantly, not just because of its spot-on portrayal of the callousness and demented nature of American journalism, but because Dan Gilroy personifies it in the form of an actual sociopath. Gyllenhaal's haunting performance is so compelling that, in spite of his character's dreadful actions and creepy demeanour, one actually feels just a little bit pleased for him when he succeeds. In spite of the murders, accidents, attacks and other violent acts committed throughout the film, it was that little spark of sympathy for the main character that frightened me most.Nightcrawler is a superb film that boasts a talented cast, wonderfully dark twists and electrifying tension.",9,0,0,20 February 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A perfect quiet before the storm
","You'd be forgiven for questioning whether this was a Potter movie after all. No Maggie Smith, no floating candles, no Quidditch - we never even set foot inside Hogwarts. But believe me - we get a Potter movie like you've never seen.Most of the visual magic takes place in the first act, as we're treated to a batch of Polyjuice Potion, a Wizard wedding and a rather spectacular chase sequence on a flying motorbike. But for the main chunk of the film, Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 is a character study, plain and simple. Supported by beautiful landscapes and top-notch cinematography, the film focuses almost exclusively on our three heroes as they travel far and wide in their search for an answer to what is turning into a full-scale war.Deathly Hallows goes to places not previously explored, particularly given the franchise's lighter beginnings under the guidance of Chris Columbus, as we now tackle heavy issues of racism, ethnic cleansing, slavery and Rowling's magical interpretation of Nazism. The style and atmosphere is reminiscent of post-apocalyptic fiction and cosy-catastrophe concepts worthy of H.G. Wells or John Wyndham. The icing on the cake would be Ben Hibon's superbly animated 'Tale of the Three Brothers', one of the finest sequences in the entire franchise. As if that weren't enough, we also get perfectly timed blends of horror, romance and, finally, tragedy.Aside from a few niggling points that only a reader of the book could complain about - maybe Harry's farewell to the Dursleys was too rushed - the film is a wonderfully atmospheric prelude, a tight interpretation of its source material, and a perfect quiet before the storm.",10,2,5,18 February 2016
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Better than it has any right to be
","Okay, so it has neither the trashy vitality of the original Terminator movie, nor the gravitas of Judgement Day - but this belated third installment in the sci-fi action franchise is a great deal better than it has any right to be.Featuring the now adult John Connor living as a drifter, he is pursued by this film's main adversary – the Terminatrix, played with ice-cool efficiency by Kristanna Loken. While the action and chase scenes are certainly gripping – with a chase through downtown L.A. being one of the highlights – the film is initially deterred by a few questionable special effects, and its lack of what made the first two installments so memorable: the diverse plot that touched on the emotions of the characters and audience alike. In addition, the film scarcely takes itself seriously, with a collection of gags and puns that sometimes diffuse the sense of pace.Nonetheless, the tragic final act of the film is bound to pull the heartstrings of even the most die-hard action fan, and gives a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.",7,0,0,8 June 2009
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," This one looks and sounds better, and feels awesome too
","Now we're getting to the meaty stuff. Harry cops an attitude! As the children become adolescents, the filmmaking skills surrounding them mature also. Alfonso Cuarón confidently adopts and revitalises a well established cinematic world designed by Chris Columbus. The visual effects are now tighter than ever; the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking; and Radcliffe and his teenage co-stars are now steady on their feet.What shines through in this third instalment that didn't quite make it in the first two is the rich and emotional story, as Harry struggles not only with new revelations about his past, but with ordinary life as a teenage boy as well. New recruits Oldman and Thewlis are fantastic together, and Gambon's turn as Dumbledore (after Richard Harris' regrettably short run) breathes new life into the character, and it's remarkable.Looking great and sounding great was accomplished by Columbus. This one looks and sounds better, and feels awesome too.",9,0,0,27 November 2004
Aliens," The best sequel I've ever seen
","Aliens had a powerful build-up to its release. In 1979, Alien terrified audiences and is now hailed - rightly so - as one of the most important sci-fi and horror films of all time. Subsequently, in 1984, James Cameron released his powerful debut The Terminator. (If you discount his true debut, Piranha II. Eek.) While Alien proved how terrifying sci-fi can be, Terminator proved the same - but also how emotional it can be too. Aliens builds on the legacy of both its predecessor, and Cameron's own predecessor. He expertly explores the emotional back-stories of the characters that we just weren't given the time to do in Alien. But he doesn't forget what the sci-fi buffs and the horror fans want - plenty of action, plenty of screams and a grand spectacle. Aliens is, quite simply, the best sequel I've ever seen.",10,1,2,18 February 2016
Resident Evil," Highly entertaining, an intense action-thriller
","For die-hard fans of the original 'Resident Evil' video game series, this film may come as a disappointment, as the general horror and darkness that made the games so unnerving has been ditched here, in lieu of an intense action-thriller. Nonetheless, in its own right, this film is highly entertaining.Milla Jovovich puts in a superb performance as Alice, who is lead into an underground base of a multi-national corporation to do battle with a series of ghoulies and monsters, including a horde of the undead. With terrific co-star Michelle Rodriguez, there is never a dull moment, moving at a furious pace with just the right mix of dry humour, mystery that surrounds the 'Umbrella Corporation' and its motives, and impressive action sequences featuring an agile Jovovich in the dress she's barely wearing performing some remarkable stunts.",8,3,4,22 February 2010
Alien vs. Predator," Not very thoughtful, but keeps you occupied
","I saw Alien vs. Predator a lot of years ago, and I remember it leaving a bit of a non-impression on me. I remembered it as a little dull, and a bit daft. But recently, I went through both film franchises again. I decided that after the stupid Predator 2, the boring Alien 3 and, well, whatever the hell Alien 4 was, AVP couldn't get much worse. Having given it another go, I was thoroughly entertained by it.There's not much of a story, the plot is narrow and the human characters don't have much to offer. It was nice seeing the old familiar face of Lance Henriksen again, and Ewan Bremner and Tommy Flanagan are decent. As for Sanaa Lathan, she's certainly no Sigourney Weaver, but she does a fair job at holding her own as the leading lady. But after the first half, she and the rest of the cast really have very little to do. Once an hour or so is spent teasing us with slight glimpses, references and homages, the focus permanently shifts to fleshing out the history and mythology of our two titular beasts, moreover, watching them knock lumps out of each other.First of all, AVP is a welcome improvement over the pathetic CGI blob of Alien 3 and the hybrid monstrosities of its sequel. The creature designs in this one are refined, back-to-basics designs that made the first two films work so well, including a welcome back for our favourite Alien, the Queen herself. All the Aliens are scary and menacing looking. Some have criticised their scenes for being too dark, but that's their trademark, and how they should have been kept. Surrounded by darkness, barely visible, not knowing which corner they're gonna leap out of next. In this respect, Predator becomes a much more threatening villain too. Adapting to the horror tone of its counterpart, it still delivers the action thrills the Predator films are known for. Watching the two of them fight is a real treat for the eyes and ears.Nonetheless, in spite of everything it has going for it, it still doesn't leave that big an impression on me. It really doesn't make you think. But for its two hour run-time, it will keep you occupied. It's the best Alien film since James Cameron's Aliens and, dare I say, it's the best Predator film so far. I was expecting nothing more than watching the two beasts scrapping with each other and killing each other in imaginative ways. And that's exactly what I got. I'm a happy shopper.",7,1,2,18 February 2016
28 Days Later...," The most misunderstood film of the decade
","This terrific film has turned out to be the most misunderstood film of the decade. Referring to it as a 'zombie horror' is incorrect in its entirety: the creatures in the film are NOT the undead, but are in fact humans that are infected with a devastating virus that locks them into a permanent state of murderous rage; and while one could be forgiven for calling the film a horror, it is in fact a focus on human drama, as the protagonists struggle to understand and deal with their predicament.Having said that, the film does deliver a few genuinely terrifying moments, and the geysers of gore are frequent enough to keep the horror fans happy. The early scenes are the most memorable, as we see the deserted city of London explored by a formerly comatose Cillian Murphy, ignorant to the devastation that the virus has caused.Stealing the show is actor Naomi Harris, with her brilliant portrayal of Selena, while Danny Boyle's direction and John Murphy's music are close seconds.",9,6,9,12 November 2008
It Follows," May be one of the better horror films of late, but that's hardly a challenge
","It Follows really doesn't deserve the huge favourable critical reception and positive word-of-mouth that it's getting. It definitely gets some things right: its eerie 80s inspired soundtrack adds to the tension, and there's plenty of tension to be had in some of its scenes. It also has more brains than most witless demonic horror films of the last five-ish years, ever since the popularity of Paranormal Activity suggested to filmmakers that all you need to do is shake a camera and have something go thud before an actor in prosthetic make-up screams at the camera.However, what It Follows lacks is a decent story. Maika Monroe's competent performance doesn't disguise the lacklustre character she's been given to play, nor the unoriginal and sometimes laughable dialogue. In fact, the film's tension is diffused on several occasions by some unintentional - or perhaps just poorly constructed - comedy.It may be one of the better horror films to arrive of late, but that's hardly a challenge.",4,0,3,20 February 2016
I Am Legend," A touching piece, if quite flawed
","After Will Smith, who delivers a truly excellent performance as the lonely Robert Neville, New York City becomes the real star of this show, as we see the capital of consumerism abandoned and reduced to ruins ravaged by animals and monsters alike. The film gracefully explores the themes of isolation, loss and determination, and Neville's dog Sam is the most emotionally poignant companion since Wilson in Cast Away.However, the film falters in its third act, with the introduction of two human survivors who we simply aren't given the time to know or care about, and who actually spoil the tense silence that comes before it. The film's other main flaw is the monsters themselves, who are rather badly digitally produced and simply aren't very frightening. But come the final moments, Robert's story comes to a heart-rending peak, beautifully played by Smith. (I speak of the film's superior alternate ending, not the 'God loves us' fodder of the theatrical version.)I Am Legend is a taut and touching piece, if quite flawed.",7,0,0,18 February 2016
School of Rock," Easy to forgive
","Indie director Richard Linklater goes mainstream in this unpretentious comedy about a failed heavy metal guitarist (Jack Black) who poses as a substitute teacher to earn some quick cash. Stuck in a classroom full of nerdy overachievers, he decides to loosen them up by moulding them into a rock band.The film only contains a few funny lines and does not live up to the comedy genre. However, Black is his usual loveably slobbish self, Joan Cusack (Principal Mullins) plays her wound-up character well and the kids are cute, so it's easy to forgive the film for only raising a few chuckles rather than belly laughs.",7,0,0,2 August 2005
Ex Machina," Bicentennial Man 2 this is not
","The directorial debut of talented writer Alex Garland contains obvious moral lessons about mankind's ever-growing dependence on technology - but it is presented in a way that is balanced, light-handed and not at all preachy.Instead, Alicia Vikander's beautifully realised cybernetic character is used as a tool to flesh out the inner workings of the two humans, tactfully played by Gleeson and Isaac.Bicentennial Man 2 this is not, as Garland offers a much darker insight into the human condition and our relationship with technology, nature and each other.",8,1,3,20 February 2016
Shrek 2," Well worth the wait
","It was well worth the three year wait for this superb sequel to the 2001 animated comedy, which reunites Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz while introducing John Cleese, Julie Andrews, Rupert Everett and Jennifer Saunders to the flatulent green ogre.The plot is pretty simple. Shrek and his beloved wife Fiona are torn apart in a plot by a wily Fairy Godmother (Saunders) to marry the princess off to her son, Prince Charming. Nevertheless, it is just a frame on which to hang a a hilarious sequence of spoofs and gags. Stealing the show is Antonio Banderas as Puss In Boots.P.S. Look out for a direct reference to the 70's sci-fi classic 'Alien'.",8,0,1,22 December 2005
Saw II," Nowhere near as great as the marvellous original
","Although this follow-up to the marvellous 2004 thriller 'Saw' is nowhere near as great as the original, it is still a good film worth watching.The 'Jigsaw' killer plays another sick game with another unlucky group of people. They are placed in a booby-trapped house that is slowly filling up with a lethal nerve gas. They are doomed to die, unless they can find out what they have in common, complete various tasks in the house and find the antidote.Where the original film's gore could be forgiven on the account of its high logic, this lazy sequel is just gore for its own sake. The pace has been slowed down to a snail's and there are fewer scares and twists to keep the viewer as interested. Nevertheless, few viewers will have worked out the final, nasty twist, which makes it all worthwhile.",5,26,45,19 April 2006
World Trade Center," Stone makes a true story feel fictional
","You'd expect an Oliver Stone film about the attacks on the Twin Towers to be a paranoid conspiracy film, but the director of JFK has confounded expectations by coming up with a drama about two cops trapped under the rubble of the World Trade Center after the towers collapsed.The movie focuses so narrowly on the fate of the officers (Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena) and their waiting wives (Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal) that we miss the bigger picture, and it might as well be a tale of miners stranded underground.Stone's film celebrates heroism; but by restraining his usual flamboyance in favour of following the Hollywood formbook he's succeeded in making a true story feel fictional.",Null,2,5,1 October 2006
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Expertly thought out and put together
","Unpopular amongst some viewers and readers alike, Order of the Phoenix is the most politically minded film of the series, the most down to earth, and possibly the smartest. Visual effects and wondrous magical spells - while present of course - definitely take a back seat, and the focus is shifted onto the threats of corruption, power, censorship and the media, as it is revealed that the magical government is unfortunately as crooked as our own.In one of Rowling's smartest moves, her personification of everything wrong with the education system is delivered in the form of Dolores Umbridge, a character so morally bankrupt and far more threatening than Voldemort himself. Imelda Staunton is almost too good in the role, as the skin crawls and the blood boils every time she steps in front of the camera. The maturing cast continues to improve, with a breath of fresh air provided by Evanna Lynch as Luna, whose comic timing never fails to bring a smile. Also welcome back are Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson, not to mention the intensely threatening Jason Issacs and his fabulous hair.Though the important themes of the movie come first, the cinematography and the visuals must be congratulated. The pace of the film is somewhat inconsistent, and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg seems to lose his grip on the material at times, which may confuse viewers who haven't read the book. And while the final battle sequence is the most intense and brilliantly shot yet, it seems over far too quickly.In spite of its few drawbacks, Phoenix is so expertly thought out and put together, and is the first film of the franchise that really forces its Muggle audience to think about their own world.",8,0,3,18 February 2016
Drag Me to Hell," Deplorable garbage
","After directing the infamous 'The Evil Dead', a childishly ghoulish ultra-violent splatter film, Sam Raimi then moved on to more serious projects, such as 'The Gift' and the 'Spiderman' trilogy. With all that going for him, he inexplicably decided to conjure up this deplorable garbage. The perhaps unintentionally comic moments are far more effective than the cheap thrills and shocks.While 'Evil Dead' could be forgiven for its originality in the special effects department, and for the fact that there are some truly dark moments, 'Drag Me To Hell' goes far too over the top with its repulsive graphics, with several scenes revolving around vomit, blood, mucus or some other unmentionable bodily fluids.Although supporting actor Justin Long gives a remarkable performance – particularly towards the end – the rest of the cast have nothing special to offer. And with such a negligible plot, Christie's cat and a goat become the only characters that one can offer any sympathy.",3,7,18,6 June 2009
La La Land," Painfully and shamefully average
","Having waited a year since its original release before I finally saw it meant that I could watch it without the typical Oscars hype that surrounded it. And frankly, I just don't get what the hype was all about.The story is a somewhat muddled tale of a struggling actress and a jazz musician who fall in love, though they struggle to keep things together as they chase their dreams. Now, a plain story like this can usually be dressed up in a musical with flashy singing and dancing - neither of which are present here. The songs are repetitive, as it turns out that listening to the exact same chord progression repeated for two hours can become a bit tedious; and Stone and Gosling's 'singing-in-the-shower' warbles certainly didn't dazzle this viewer. In fact, their restrained musical performances are an embarrassment to the resplendent costumes and sets that surround them.What's worst, however, is that its potential did shine through. There are two or three dramatic scenes between Stone and Gosling that are so well written and brilliantly acted, they genuinely show up the mediocrity of the rest. It's not a bad film, by any standards, just very painfully and shamefully average.Finally, I watch enough Strictly Come Dancing to be irked by the poor shaping of Emma Stone's hands during her final musical number with Ryan Gosling. But that's being quite picky, isn't it?",5,0,0,3 December 2017
Saw," An amazing, slick, sick whodunnit
","Less a horror than a slick, sick whodunnit, this amazing film certainly has it all: scares, shocks and twists. Basically, photographer Leigh Whannell (who also co-wrote the script) wakes up chained by the ankle to a bathroom wall. Chained to the other end is doctor Cary Elwis. They soon realise they are playing one of the 'Jigsaw' killer's sick games, in which he teaches the victims how much life is worth.High on logic and (reasonably) low on gore, James Wan and Leigh Whannell seem to unmask the killer pretty early on in the film, before cleverly misdirecting you. Although the film is pretty low on gore, I would still only advise you to watch it if you are strong-hearted, as the atmosphere is quite harrowing.",7,0,1,8 April 2006
The Fly," Truly disturbing
","Not a lot of people realise that this is a remake of an old Vincent Price classic about a man who's head is transplanted onto a fly's and vice versa. Whilst that film was a ridiculous B-movie, this truly disturbing adaptation is something far different.An obsessive scientist decides to try out the teleportation machine he is perfecting on himself, little realising that an ordinary housefly is trapped in the transfer chamber with him. Upon reappearance, he seems to be normal. But he soon begins to slowly transform into a monstrous hybrid.While most horror fans may see this as a silly monster movie, little realise that at the heart of the story lies a man who is trying to fight a bizarre form of cancer that he is slowly succumbing to. The on-screen chemistry between then-husband and wife Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis brings the real sense of tragedy to this movie. This helps transcend the grotesque display of mutated flesh going on here.",10,1,3,31 July 2006
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Repugnant, rancid and truly appalling work of supposed art
","Some films don't give you room to study their themes, their characters, their plots and stories, their artistic merit. Films like Salo are overshadowed by two simple questions: Who on earth made this? And for Christ's sake, why? While modern day critics enjoy jeering at what they refer to as 'torture porn', films like Saw and Hostel often quoted as examples, they really need to get over themselves. They clearly haven't seen this repugnant, rancid and truly appalling work of supposed art.Okay. To be fair, Pasolini had every right to make it. It isn't totally devoid of artistic merit. For example, the scenes that stick out in my mind - for the right reasons - are the shots of the beautifully made-up, bejewelled and coiffured women, dressed in furs. They gather in a luscious room of a palace and, while a pianist tickles the ivories, tip-toe gracefully around the room whilst recounting the most stomach-turning stories of sexual depravity you're ever likely to hear in a motion picture. It's quite a striking image.However, pit those sort of scenes against the film as a whole. The seventeen young men and women who, for no particular reason, are forced into sexual slavery for a group of rich perverts. That these young men and women are seldom seen wearing clothes as they are raped, tortured, beaten, treated like dogs, fed needles, treated to a banquet of human feces. Seriously, do you still want to watch this? The artistic justification for this depravity is almost entirely absent.'Oh, but it doesn't have to justify itself! It's meant to be shocking! It's meant to disturb you! It's about the darkest recesses of the human soul!' I hear the critics cry. Honestly? I don't care. Salo is a nasty, nasty film that cannot wait to show you the next nasty act that promises to be even nastier than the last. It really doesn't examine the human condition as deeply as it clearly thinks it does. I cannot recommend it on any level whatsoever.Tom Six, all is forgiven.",2,2,6,18 February 2016
The Descent," Directed with masterful precision
","Although the uneven werewolf movie 'Dog Soldiers' was warmly embraced by some horror buffs, this is a far more confident and unsettling chiller from Brit director Niel Marshall.When six female spelunkers go potholing in the North American Appalachian mountains, they become trapped by a rockfall. During their attempts to escape, they discover something very nasty lurking in the underground labyrinth. Marshall tightens the screws on the viewer with masterful precision, even if the geysers of gore are sometimes so unintentionally comical as to defuse his carefully wrought tension.While the American version of the ending delivers a good scare, the British delivers a much more thought-provoking and open-ended cliffhanger, while still including the American's scare.",8,3,7,30 September 2006
Titanic," As perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get
","'Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one.' It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.",10,4,4,18 February 2016
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The one you can't really criticise because it started it all
","So it's the one that started it all - also known as 'the one you can't really criticise because it started it all'. In other words, it makes me feel awful to have to say something negative about what is a good start to possibly the greatest film franchise of all time. But I want to be objective. So, I'll try to just get the negatives out the way firstly and quickly: the film definitely has not aged well. Its PS2-worthy graphics are sometimes laughable, particularly in the troll and Quidditch sequences. In addition, the film sometimes struggles to cram everything into the short space it has - for example, that the first act with the Dursleys is so short is both a curse and a blessing: we don't get to experience the nitty-gritty early years of abuse suffered by Harry that is so well documented in the books - but on the other hand, it just means we get to the magic of Hogwarts so much faster. And finally, on a negative point, its decidedly light and almost twee tone makes it very much child-friendly, but may cause the adults to lose interest now and then. I'm sorry, but these things had to be said.But let's face it - who cares? To anyone who's never seen or read Harry Potter before, this is the compulsory stepping stone in what turns out to be a most magnificent journey. So brilliantly crafted by Columbus and of course Rowling, Philosopher's Stone features some of the best acting talent Britain has to offer - special mentions going to Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, the late Richard Harris and, in particular, Alan Rickman as Snape - the role he was born to play. The sets depict almost exactly what any reader has ever imagined, and the kids - well - they're pretty bloody cute.Philosopher's Stone is not the best - it's just a taste test. What happens next is delicious.",7,0,1,18 February 2016
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Funniest, most exciting, most emotional and most frightening Potter instalment yet
","What's more frightening? Tackling a fire-breathing dragon or asking someone out on a date? Yet another improvement on its predecessors, Goblet of Fire is the funniest, most exciting, most emotional and most frightening Potter instalment yet. Radcliffe, Watson and Grint deliver their best performances thus far, showing a firm grip of the much darker and more emotionally challenging material here. Newell and Kloves ensure that the powerful material contained within its complex storyline is never lost; but they also manage to perfectly capture the angst and insecurity suffered by our adolescent heroes with a wicked sense of humour.The ever-expanding ensemble are at the top of their game here, with top-notch performances from Tennant, Pack, Gleeson and Pattinson (I know, right?). But stealing the show has to be the Dark Lord himself, as Fiennes - with a little help from the CGI team - delivers a turn as Voldemort that marks a definitive transformation to the series. It's gonna be a rough ride from here on out.Compressing a 600-page book into a film less than three hours long is never going to be easy, so the most faithful readers may not be totally satisfied with the absence of some material. For the rest, Goblet of Fire is simply awesome.",10,1,1,27 November 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," It's not brilliant yet - it's just damn good
","Still under the helm of Columbus, the franchise thus far maintains its light and child-friendly atmosphere for the most part. Nonetheless, in spite of Columbus' tendency towards the childish and twee, we can see the yummy darkness begin to cast its shadow over Hogwarts.In some ways, it surpasses the first chapter. The visuals are more convincing; the acting, particularly from the children, is starting to improve; and it's a scarier ride overall. However, as of yet, Harry's story lacks emotional depth, which Radcliffe at this age isn't quite ready to let us explore, and doesn't quite live up to its strong visual effects and wondrous ensemble cast. It's not brilliant yet - it's just damn good.",7,0,1,18 February 2016
War of the Worlds," A cut above the usual sci-fi blockbuster.
","Although Steven Spielberg has remained remarkably faithful to the narrative thrust of H.G. Wells' 1898 sci-fi classic, this grim and gritty drama is very much a contemporary vision of alien invasion.'Is it terrorists?' frets one onlooker as the towering extraterrestrial war machines begin obliterating New Jersey amid scenes eerily reminiscent of 11th September 2001. Much later, another character observes 'No occupying army has ever won the war' in an uneasy reminder of the current situation in Iraq.'Independence Day 2' this is not, with the special effects taking a back seat to the human drama as a neglectful father (Tom Cruise) attempt to reunite his dysfunctional children (Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin) with his estranged wife (Miranda Otto). With a great performance delivered from Cruise and an even superior one from young Fanning, this really is a cut above the usual sci-fi blockbuster.",8,0,1,28 February 2006
Edge of Tomorrow," A surprising treat
","I really wasn't expecting much from this one. After Cruise's awful 'Oblivion', this looked like another generic action flick with no heart, no brain and no fun. Fortunately, Edge of Tomorrow is a smart, often humorous and very tense film. The visuals are stunning, and it contains the best utilisation of 3D I've seen in a long while. Cruise is excellent (which grinds on me somewhat, as I really don't like the guy - but his talent is undeniable), and Blunt is effective and agile in her first action blockbuster. The comparisons to Groundhog Day are valid, and it might actually help to watch that first. This is that, but with monsters. A surprising treat.",8,0,1,18 February 2016
Con Air," A showcase of the worst action movie tropes of the 90s
","Con Air is a showcase of the worst tropes that plagued action films of the 90s. The unlikeable and badly acted lead character with some convoluted goal involving a child; the never-ending loud and violent explosion sequences; the villain who simply refuses to die, dragging the film's running time out beyond a level that is considered entertaining; a sparse selection of female characters that are furniture to fawn over or be rescued by testosterone-fuelled 'hunks'; and an ending that celebrates the freedom of a hot-tempted soldier (or 'American hero', as they are colloquially known) and a charismatic psychopath, a violent death for the villain and, of course, money. John Malkovich's charisma unfortunately can't save this piece of tat.",3,1,4,18 February 2016
Prometheus," Gorgeous, intelligent and skilfully made
","Prometheus is a gorgeous, intelligent and skilfully made film that stays true to its origins. There are times where the pace lags behind, and perhaps it delves too deep into its own themes and ideas that simply can't be fully explored or appreciated within its running time. But with dazzling visuals, well rounded and well performed characters and a sort-of open non-ending, it's simply begging for a sequel. And so am I.",8,1,3,3 December 2017
Carrie," One of the best movies ever made
","There are few books-turned-movies that one can truthfully say that the movie is better than the book. However, this terrifying and disturbing masterpiece from director Brian de Palma is one of those few.Carrie White (played by Oscar nominated Sissy Spacek) is a bullied outcast who secretly possesses the gift of telekinesis: the ability to move objects using forces of the mind. When she is asked to go to the senior prom, her life seems to take a turn for the better. But when a cruel joke is played on her, she finally snaps, forcing her to exercise her terrible gift.The first hour or so of the movie is a powerful lead-up to the film's climax, where Palma unveils one of the most terrifying scenes in cinema history. With spectacular performances from Spacek as Carrie and Piper Laurie as her mother Margaret, 'Carrie' is one of the best films ever made.",10,3,5,5 September 2006
The Dark Knight Rises," One of the best comic-to-film adaptations of all time
","After Murphy's twisted Scarecrow and Ledger's psychotic Joker, Christopher Nolan ensures that the final act of the trilogy breaks new ground, with Tom Hardy's Bane being one of the most dazzlingly charming and - with equal measure - pant-wettingly terrifying comic book villains ever committed to film.The unmitigated sense of dread throughout is enthralling, and the film's sheer size and scope - including story, action and visual effects - makes The Dark Knight Rises not only a truly satisfying conclusion to Nolan's series, but one of the best comic-to-film adaptations of all time.",9,1,3,18 February 2016
Godzilla," Very disappointing
","I understand that this is a film about Godzilla, and the masses buying their tickets want to see cities and landscapes smashed to a million billion bits. In this respect, Godzilla 2014 delivers outright. But there's no reason we shouldn't get a decent story as well. As soon as we see the eponymous creature, the humanistic side of the film descends into chaos. The characters are one-dimensional, the script is terrible and I can barely remember any dialogue. In addition, I couldn't help but note how intrusive Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack was. Gone is the tense, choral subtlety of the film's trailer and we are instead treated to Hollywood-standard booming orchestral pieces that actually make the monsters less terrifying.But on a positive note, Godzilla himself was absolutely gorgeous, and Edwards bravely waits almost a full hour to unleash him in one of the best unveilings of any cinematic character of all time. It's mad to think how an entirely digital creation can become the emotional centre of a story. And someone definitely deserves some kind of award for the film's sound design. It's just a shame that Edwards loaded the film with walking clichés, while forgetting to give show-stealer Bryan Cranston anything to do. Very disappointing.",4,5,8,18 February 2016
V for Vendetta," A strongly-worded cautionary tale
","Its narrative is quite contrived and melodramatic - but in this case, it really doesn't matter. Its powerful message is hammered home with great intensity, supported by an excellent cast and great visuals. V for Vendetta will be a fantastic thrill-ride for some, and a strongly-worded cautionary tale for others.",8,3,4,3 December 2017
