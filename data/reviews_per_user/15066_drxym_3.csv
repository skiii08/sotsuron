Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Dull plot, CG laden and general waste of potential
","The plot of this film and Jar Jar Binks have been mercilessly parodied and its not hard to see why.This film really does have one of the most boring plots. The framework for this movie is a trade federation blockade and politics of a galactic senate. Great. Within this framework we have a couple of Jedi occasionally hacking their way through various CG robots, some *extremely* irritating and unconvincing CG characters, a rather good but overlong pod race in the middle and a dull denouement where yet more CG characters fight CG robots inter-cut with the Jedis fighting a baddie called Darth Maul. CG is okay in doses, but it does not make up for a saggy plot or other deficiencies.Darth Maul is the most interesting thing about the film and he is woefully underused. Aside from being a bad ass fighter, we have no better clue who he is or what he wants. Recall previous Star Wars where the duels were accompanied by a duel of words - Obi Wan Kenobi squaring up to Vader, or Vader vs Luke Skywalker. The words were as interesting as the fighting itself and I bet most fans can recall them. The Jedis and Darth Maul size each other up, and fight in near silence. What a waste. As someone wrote for Slate (if I recall), why not use the opportunity for Maul to expound his beliefs and perhaps even semi-convince the 'maverick' Jedi played by Liam Neeson of what he is trying to do.Aside from this, not much else sticks in the mind. The acting is universally wooden, thanks no doubt to the amount of CG filling each scene - 'Mr Neeson stand in front of this green screen and say your lines to the tennis ball on a stick. We'll fill in who you're talking to and the space port you're standing in later.'. The child actor playing Annakin is irritating, and the CG Jar Jar is even more so.I have to say that Attack of the Clones went some way to mitigate the annoying Jar Jar by making him the tragic instigator of the Clone Wars. But if ever Lucas ever re-cuts these films (as he is wont to do when his bank balance dips below several billion), he should re-voice this annoying creation and give him half as much to say.",5,1,2,13 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Great effects, dull plot
","I wonder if people will ever learn... This marks strike two for Lucas. The second in his 'prequel' trilogy represents a triumph of special effects and action but a giant leap backwards in terms of plot and dialogue.The special effects are outstanding, but it would be nice if Lucas actually used some of that money to hire some decent script writers. As it is, the actors flatly speak their silly lines and in the end you're just waiting for the next action sequence to begin. Particularly excruciating is the romance between Anakin & Padme which explores every clich√© in the book and drags on and on. Fortunately when the action does arrive, it is very exciting and the ending is pretty good with a nice arena sequence and showdown between Yoda and Dooku.I actually rewatched this movie just recently on TV (a gap of three years since I first saw it) and if anything the acting comes across as even more wooden. The script isn't just bad, it's a rotten egg. With hindsight I see why every scene is filmed with CG eye candy - to distract from the train wreck in the foreground. As with the Phantom Menace, I don't believe the actors are at fault here. You get what you expect when you actors stupid lines to say to blank space in front of a green screen.It is a slightly better movie that the Phantom Menace but nowhere near as good as the original three.",6,1,2,16 May 2002
Mission: Impossible II," Snorefest
","Some of the stunts in MI:2 are great but that's all can be said for it. The dialogue is terrible, the plot is boring and the twists and turns are laughably far fetched. John Woo made a terrible career move when he directed this clunker.What plot there is involves stealing a virus before the bad guy can get it but it does so in such a ham handed way that you just don't care. Nor for the zero-chemistry romance between Cruise & Newton. Worse yet, there is hardly any originality here, all the Mission Impossible tricks are ripoffs from the first movie - rubber masks (employed multiple times), computer hacking, dangling on wires, breaking into a building etc. It's just desperate how cliched it all is.",4,0,0,21 April 2002
