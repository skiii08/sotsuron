Requiem for a Dream," The ultimate 'art as pain' movie.
","If you subscribe to the masochistic belief that great art must be painful, then by all means, see Requiem for a Dream. If, on the other hand, you'd rather not spend 2 hours having Aronofsky pick at you like a scab, skip it. The director's intention is clearly to upset you, give you a headache, and instill in you a hatred of addictive behavior. He succeeds marvelously.Wayans, in the closing sequence of the film, vomits into a bucket of some white viscous somethingorother he's stirring.That about sums up my reaction to Requiem for a Dream.",1,14,28,29 May 2002
The Butterfly Effect," Solid, entertaining what-if thriller
","Butterfly Effect is from the same team that brought us the excellent horror sequel Final Destination 2, and the internal similarities (characterizations, shot composition, sequencing) are intriguing. While Butterfly Effect is by no means a masterpiece of modern moviemaking, mainstream critics have treated it far too unkindly.It does tend to jerk the viewer around a bit emotionally, but that is surely the effect the filmmakers were going for. I recommend The Butterfly Effect to anyone who enjoys a visually tasty what-if piece with a well-cast group of talented young actors.",8,0,0,2 February 2004
