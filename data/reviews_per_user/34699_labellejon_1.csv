Requiem for a Dream," Sticks with you long after the movie is over
","This was my favorite movie in high school and it still remains one of my favorites. Pi set the tone for what was to come with Aronofsky films. Requiem for a Dream absolutely solidified his film making vision. Then you add the collaboration of Clint Mansell with the Kronos Quartet and you have a disturbing masterpiece of cinematic art. That is no easy accomplishment. He has only achieved more since then and continues to use Clint Mansell for his scores, and I would have it no other way. This can be a hard one to watch for most, but I do believe that is the point.",10,1,1,10 September 2018
