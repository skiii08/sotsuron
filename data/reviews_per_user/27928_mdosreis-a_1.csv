Black Swan," Weak Fight Club inspired movie.
","Seems like a weak and predictable attempt at going for a Fight Club like result. Storyline is totally predictable and unoriginal. Natalie Portman is well, but not astonishing and losing weight or learning some ballet doesn't make up for poor character construction and really just being herself throughout the movie. The directing is very poor, severely wanting steady-cam for the first 15 minutes or so, and totally missing glorious beauty factor that should be there for any great ballet inspired movie, having only a few truly beautiful scenes. Comes out as disturbed and not disturbing, unnecessarily violent and not strong, cheap instead of sensual. As some others have said a lame pseudo-thriller/horror movie attempting to go by as an art movie. Grows towards the ending, but predictability and lack of good art direction really ruins the moment. A true disappointment and a waste of money, especially considering the great reviews it's been having. Another example of movie industry and critics going in the opposite direction of what good film making is supposed to be, choosing weird over good, disturbed over moving, appearance over greatness. Goes straight to the list of movies I would rather not have wasted my time on.",1,5,10,13 February 2011
