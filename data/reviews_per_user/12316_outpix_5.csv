Deja Vu," What could of been
",If your going to create a fantastical premise at least make the ordinary plausible. The first half was entertaining but it slowly deteriorates into a nonsensical action farce. There so may holes in the second half of this plot you could drive a truck through it. If you don't care about integrity in a movie than you will enjoy it otherwise move on.,6,0,0,24 August 2017
BlacKkKlansman," Another self indulgent trip by Spike
","If your obsessed with race and identity politics, you may like this feature. But if you were hoping for another Malcolm X, you'll be sorely disappointed. Sad to see a film maker degrade himself to this level. Spike has not only drank the Kool Aid, he's serving it out in buckets and he seems to be the authority on race relations in America so it's probably not wise to criticize him. After all, I've only lived in America longer than he has.",3,6,14,17 November 2018
Revolutionary Road," 'You were just some boy that made me laugh at a party once.'
","Revolutionary Road (RR) opens as a dreary 'American Dream' landscape that we are not only a part of, but forced to share. RR is intent on making us feel....that is, to which we are undoubtedly numb. Director Sam Mendes (of American Beauty fame) does not make the case that happiness is an illusion but the implication is obvious. The story takes a welcome turn when an antagonist, a former psychiatric patient played by Michael Shannon, ironically reminds the Wheelers (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) that it's not enough to satiate life like an empty stomach; It has to be throttled and shuck like a tree until its fruits are given.DiCaprio's character is afraid to risk the unknown while Winslet's sees no alternatives in 1950's social Connecticut. DiCaprio is compelling and Winslet is magnificent. RR is like listening to Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska album, you love it but you don't want to go back there too often.",8,2,4,19 January 2009
Aladdin," Kids will love it
",Subpar acting and a screenplay that struggles makes this a forgettable feature but your kids will love it.,5,1,6,25 June 2019
The Mist," Could of been a contender
",This feature could of been a classic but it suffers from some bad acting and incredulous plot turns. When will Stephen King allow a truly respected director to do justice to one of his scarier works? I would of loved to of seen what Spielberg could of done here. Too bad we're left with sub-par films.,7,0,2,2 June 2017
