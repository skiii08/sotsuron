United 93," United 93 Review
",This was the second movie I watched that was related to the events of September 11th 2001 after World Trade Center. I can tell you now that this movie is better than both World Trade Center and Flight 93. The scene where Flight 175 hits the South Tower of the World Trade Center is very shocking because the movie uses the original CNN footage of the attack. The ending scene is violent but at the same time will make people cheer as Mark Bingham crushes Ahmed Al-Haznawi's skull with a fire extinguisher and Jeremy Glick snaps Ahmed Al-Nami's neck. Overall a very emotional and awesome movie!!! Highly recommended to anyone who is interested in one of the most horrific events in world history...,9,3,5,17 December 2011
