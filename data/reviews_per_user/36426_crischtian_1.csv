Deja Vu," jerry bruckheimer at his best
","Jerry Bruckheimer as a producer has made a lot of popcorn movies in the past... and I mean A LOT! Déjà vu definitely is one of them, however one of the best J.B. has ever brought out. In some ways its different from all the others. The storyline I think is brilliant, even though the explanation for the time travel and all the technological stuff thats being used is somewhat poor, Tony Scott still made a movie that'll make u sweat until the very last second of it. Basically, you know what happens and what has happened... and that's where Denzel comes in, going back in time when the movie actually is over, to try and save the woman he fell in love with - 4 days and 6 hours in the past. Of course you recognize Bruckheimer, especially by the quote which was already usend in The Rock: 'The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.' To mention here is Jim Caviezel who is terrific as the villain.So, all in all, it is definitely a movie worth watching, even if you're not a Tony Scott or Jerry Bruckheimer fan.",10,2,4,11 January 2007
