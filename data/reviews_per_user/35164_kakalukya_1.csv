Resident Evil: Afterlife," If you are above 15 years old and think you can critic movies a little bit DON'T watch this movie.
","I liked previous Resident Evil movies especially the first one. With great enthusiasm I went to theater, hoping to have a fun Friday night. But instead of that I ended up here and writing my first review for this unbelievably bad movie.Resident Evil: Afterlife doesn't have a bad opening scene, but after that this movie show everyone how a movie doesn't has to be. First this movie doesn't have a prologue nor a conclusion. All fight scenes are unrealistic, not looks good, and don't have spirit. Musics are terrible, they are all alike and only head bang you and ruin atmosphere. Acting is bad, really bad, I don't want to be so negative but they don't give me anything good to write here, sorry. Sense of humor can make you vomit. All scary scenes are clich√© zombie boo scenes. Almost every visual effect makes you say 'that so much looks like computer made, this too, this too also,...', come on modern games have better visual effects at these days... and if you look carefully you can see too many illogical things, but I don't want to write here and give spoilers. I kept directing to last, I can clearly say this, that was the worst directing I have ever seen in my life, I don't know whether the director did this on purpose or producers forced him but he ruined movie to take benefits of 3D experience. I think main idea must be 'lets make a good movie, then lets make it 3D', not 'lets make something in 3D, OK lets make something like movie', you understand my point I think.I'm really sad and disappointed for this movie, it is even worse than Alien vs. Predator 2 for me. I'm sure you can find something better to spend your money and time. If you are not really obsessed with 3D, I recommend you to stay away from this movie. (I gave it 2/10, minimum point is 1 and +1 for 3D.)",2,11,23,17 September 2010
