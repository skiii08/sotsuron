National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Tepid, Formulaic , Nonsense
","I condemn this film, not because it is bad, but because it is lazy. Producers Turteltaub and Bruckheimer both have experience of big(pirates) and low budget(cool runnings) success.But here they switch to remote control, and the overwhelming feeling is of a film that was created to generate a paycheck, and no more.The film is rotten at the core, who cares whether Ben and Patrick Gates (played by Nic Cage and Jon Voight)ancestor was implicated in the murder of Abraham Lincoln? And without that the film loses all dramatic impetus. London? Black cabs, double decker red buses,Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, red post boxes...........yawn, it really is as predictable as that.The plot is preposterous, and helen Mirren looks as though she would have been better employed looking for a decent script rather than trotting out the banal dross she has to speak.The two hour running time is desperately short of both decent action and witty script, instead we have to trudge through a formula so clunky that you find yourself screaming for an on screen mechanic to give it some oil.Of course the set pieces are fine, and the stars do their bit - but no more.Avoid unless you are pretty desperate for something to do.",3,4,7,16 February 2008
Angels & Demons," A Waste of Talent and Money
","I have not read the book,and quite liked The Da Vinci Code so my anticipation level for this film was set quite high. Not only was I sorely disappointed, I was frustrated that so much money and acting talent had been squandered on what was basically quite a good premise for a blockbuster.Ron Howard's Directorial debut is a mess.One of the ironies of 'suspension of disbelief' is that you have to earn that right through believability.It is at this level that things fail.So a bomb is set to go off that will wipe out the whole of the Vatcian City - thats fine, i'm on board for the ride.But Howard fails to convince from start to finish. Why should Tom Hanks, as hero Robert Langdon, risk life and limb ? Why are murders committed in the fountains of busy piazza's with none of the bystanders noticing? At the end, how can the injured bad guy standing only a few feet away from Langdon and the massed ranks of Vatican Security outrun them for the finale ? The setting is superb and the visuals lush.The action sequences are numerous and well executed.Yet Hanks is lacklustre and the story told in such a preposterous way that I simply lost interest rousing myself to pay attention when Howard desperately injected another adrenaline shot into a fading corpse.At 2 hours and fifteen minutes with too much money and time, Howard is lazy and fails in the fundamental skill of telling a good story.",4,2,7,1 June 2009
Changeling," A Superb Period Drama
","A stunning drama, based on true events, which swallows up the 2 hour 20 minute running time.Director Clint Eastwood is now building up a body of work which surely already establishes him as amongst the finest Directorial talents of his generation.The tale is simple enough, that of an ordinary woman whose son goes missing, and her quest to be reunited with him.Angelina Jolie plays the leading role as crusading mother Christine Collins. Previously her parts have been dominated, and no doubt won, by her beauty. Here Eastwood ekes out a career defining acting performance in which her looks are conspicuously dressed and toned down, resulting in the unleashing of a very fine acting performance.But hers is not the only stellar performance.Jeffrey Donovan is unremittingly sly and evil as corrupt Captain Jones. Michael Kelly is superb as Detective Ybarra who stumbles across the gruesome activities at a remote farmhouse, a beacon of decency in a generally dark story.As a Director, Eastwood could not be further removed from his taciturn, largely one-dimensional but well crafted acting roles and image .His eye for 1920's detail in Los Angeles is both acute,and sumptuous.But it is his grasp of character and story which set him apart. Every part is believable and this enables him to win over the viewer to the story intellectually, and emotionally.Sub-plots of Police corruption, the role of women in 1920's American Society and contemporary Mental Health Care are starkly, awkwardly, observed, but not overplayed. The content, and intensity of performance makes this sometimes uncomfortable to watch, but what unfolds is never less than compelling.A modern classic, where story, dialogue, performance and setting combine to produce cinematic magic.",9,1,2,12 November 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Another Enjoyable Romp
","'The Pirates of the Caribbean' series has now elevated itself into rarefied company where the story itself is of lesser importance than the star turn and adherence to the conventions which the story embodies. It has become a Piratical James Bond. 'On Stranger Tides' proves to be an enjoyable and entertaining instalment in this series without ever troubling classic status.Johnny Depp IS Captain Jack Sparrow and without Orlando Bloom or Keira Knightley the focus is even more upon him this time. Neither of the latter two are missed, Penelope Cruz is an excellent new love interest as Angelica Malon, the only criticism is that we do not see enough of her, in both senses of the phrase. Her pregnancy during filming probably explains this.The opening 15 minutes in London is by far the strongest sequence as Captain jack impersonates a Judge, is arrested himself, inevitably escapes and then tries to round up a crew and a ship to search for the Fountain of Eternal Youth. Richard Griffiths plays a wonderfully louche King George, and when Jack encounters his Dad, Captain Teague played by Keith Richards in an Inn, you are just begging one or the other to pick up a mandolin from one of the musicians! Geoffrey Rush has a rewarding part as Barbossa gone straight with a letter of Marque from the King, Ian McShane is a little reserved as Blackbeard. The CGI sequences are used more sparingly this time around, and the film is all the better for it, a 'mermaid attack' being the highlight. Directed by Rob Marshall of 'nine' fame this is the first instalment not directed by Gore Verbinski, and he acquits himself well.The climax, the race for the Fountain of Youth, is for me a bit of an anti-climax and lacks dramatic tension, and the running time at 2hr 20min is a little long, but Depp's performance keeps things alive and leaves us wanting more – as if there won't be!",6,2,2,29 May 2011
Frost_Nixon," A Moment in Time Captured
","There is a paradox central to this film. The Frost/Nixon interviews were recorded over several hours, yet they are only remembered for a few minutes. Yet the running time of the film is around two hours, so what do you do with the rest of the film? There are two audiences to play to. The first, of whom I am one, are old enough to recall 'the real thing', and will see it as Drama AND history. Those too young will see it primarily as Drama.It is too fleeting in its treatment of Nixon to be called a Biography. As a snapshot of 'those moments' it is very good. But in order to understand the significance of those moments requires a remit way beyond what the film could hope to achieve. Indeed Oliver Stone's 'Nixon' needed 3 and a quarter hours, and 'All The presidents Men' needed two hours twenty minutes on Watergate alone! Inevitably it fails in this regard, and as a result much of the true drama of the occasion is lost.The credentials of Screenplay writer, Peter Morgan, are peerless. 'Last King Of Scotland', 'The Queen' and 'The Other Boleyn Girl' all demonstrate an ability to write about those at the seat of power. Michael Sheen plays an impish Frost, Frank Langella is a compelling, truculent , imposing Nixon, Kevin Bacon gives an impressively restrained performance as aide Jack Brennan, and Rebecca Hall as Frost's girlfriend Caroline Cushing has great legs.Frost was closely involved in this project and comes out of it as clean as a whistle, portrayed as a raffish ,intelligent , go getting bon viveur, whose career defining gamble pays off. Nixon is not shown unsympathetically, but the caricature of him as a clever bully who thinks he can outwit a lightweight English Talk Show Host, and fails is too simplistic.There are some wonderful vignettes, presumably true. Nixon asks Frost whether he had done any 'Fornicating' the night before  just before they start recording, and makes a soul  baring late night call to Frost, which he subsequently fails to recall. Frost makes a gift of a pair of stylish Italian slip on shoes to Nixon as a parting gift  a style which Nixon had queried Brennan on as to whether they were 'too effeminate?'.A stylish, entertaining, erudite script, is head and shoulders above the lamentably banal fare trotted out by much of Hollywood these days. Unsurprisingly, a single writer provides a cohesion and consistency of vision which multiple screenwriters so rarely deliver. Yet ultimately it is not quite enough. As a tale about a drama, it is fine, as a drama itself it does not quite find the angle to carry it off.",7,1,3,29 January 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Sharp, clever, and very funny
","Firstly, the preconceptions. I am not an Ali G fan and have previously found Cohens characters puerile, lame and unfunny. However, I could not help but be intrigued, and amused, by the pre- launch publicity, so I thought that i would give it a chance. Am I glad I did! The running time of 84mins is spot on, as soon as it runs out of steam it finishes. But before it does, it generates enough steam to power the Flying Scotsman ! Of course the toilet jokes are funny, they always have been and always will be. But the obvious humour is balanced by sharp observation - coloured mini i pods are for girls, and subtle laughs like when he throws down his suitcase in despair, - then we remember what is inside! The joke is not on Khazakstan - its on the United States which is mercilessly lampooned. It is difficult to decide which shots are 'reality' takes and which are set up. The humour rests not only with Cohen, but with the Americans who don't realise that their genuine reactions are the butt of his wit.Surprisingly sophisticated and subtle, whilst simultaneously being base and crude.This film made me laugh out loud more often than I can recently remember. I shall be fascinated to read the American reviews of this film - I don't think that they are going to like it!",8,1,7,4 November 2006
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A Shadow of What It Should Have Been
","I thoroughly enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes and approached this sequel with optimistic anticipation- only to be very disappointed. A budget that had doubled, multiple locations, and the confidence of a well received first instalment should have proved a solid platform for further success. Sadly, Director Guy Ritchie lost his way.As a pairing, Holmes, played by Robert Downey Jnr ,and Watson, by Jude Law, worked first time around. This time , Jude Law saves the pairing from disaster. I can run with Holmes as a cocaine snorting eccentric, but his eccentricities are so overwrought in this outing that his credibility as a formidable intelligence becomes unconvincing. Although I am happy to see historic capabilities rewritten and reinterpreted, his ability and acumen at street-fighting place an emphasis on the visceral, rather than cerebral which takes the character, for my tastes, far too close to Jean Claude Van Damme and Vin Diesel territory. Those thoughtful deductive powers eschewed in favour of occasional machine-gun analysis.Rachel McAdams role is reduced to a bit part, and is a peripheral figure. Noomi Rapace instead supplies the glamour in a tentative performance as Gypsy Madam Heron which doesn't convince. The Villain, Prof Moriarty, is played , uneasily, by Jared Harris whose visual likeness to Richard Stilgoe does not help the cause. Yet all is not lost. Stephen fry is excellent as Sherlock's brother, Geraldine James has pitifully little screen time as housekeeper Mrs Hudson yet delights whenever she appears, and Kelly Reilly does well in an underwritten role as Dr Watson's new wife.The plot is a noisy mess, and is largely threadbare. Swooping camera shots, fast editing and slow motion have their place but quickly the action becomes all, and the law of diminishing returns quickly comes into play. Which is a shame, because when Ritchie gets it right, it can be very good. This time an escape from an arms and munitions works shines as an ever escalating armoury of weapons is employed against them. Indeed it is such a good scene that the final reel, an attempted assassination, becomes an anti-climax.In summary, the familiar Director's curse of too much money, too weak a script/story, and indiscipline, with no-one around to say 'Guy, No!,' strikes, which is a shame. Ritchie can write good, funny dialogue (see 'Lock Stock, etc')but it is not much in evidence here, he can also handle a good action scene (the dry dock fight in the first film). But here he tries to reinvent the Holmes legend again, but only succeeds in losing the good bits and failing to improve with what he attempts in its place.",5,41,82,24 December 2011
Captain Phillips," A compelling pirate tale
","Paul Greengrass is a fine action Director, as exemplified in United 57 .Once again, he takes a factual drama, and recreates it for film. The cultural differences between the affluent United States and impoverished Somalia are cleverly woven into the opening sequences. Stateside, there are crawling six lane highways, in Somalia dirt tracks and mud encrusted Toyotas. Captain and Mrs Phillips worry about schooling for their son, a shanty, subsistence, fishing village is at the mercy of pirates with bigger fish in mind. The villager pirates tinker with rusting, beach launched, temperamental, skiffs. Captain Phillips meanders through a vast terminal in Oman to board his vertiginous container ship. The Somali dialogue is sub-titled heightening the sense of division.Tom Hanks is a consummate actor and assumes the persona of a ship's captain with ease. He is in command, but no swaggering hero. His pirate nemesis, 'Skinny' Muse, Barkhad Abdi is thin, agitated and determined. When the skiff attacks the Alabama it seems an improbable contest. Although the Alabama is unarmed, it is huge, deploying fire hoses, and travelling at speed.The ship's crew are remarkable for their ordinariness, with some protesting that their duties do not include pirate conflict, but the chief engineer is a wonderful stereo type, grey, wiry, and gnarled. Their Somali adversaries, all first time actors, are equally convincing as frenetic, desperate, khat chewing tribesmen.Once they have boarded, a conventional cat and mouse, hide and seek, scene unfolds with potential that is fully exploited by Greengrass. The drama which sees the crew seemingly triumph, then lose their captain to the pirates, is compelling. Phillips urges them to 'Stick together and we will be alright', advice tinged with irony as events unfold.Once Phillips is taken hostage, the visceral action changes from the broad sweep of the ocean, to the cockpit intensity of a lifeboat. Grengrass is brilliant in mixing the ingredients of a traditional pirate yarn, into modern day piracy, turning out one of the best action thrillers in recent years which never purports to faithfully document events, just be inspired by them. Profanity is absent, and does not harm the story one jot.Politically the film is deeply conservative. The Americans are the good guys, the Somalis the bad guys who are either killed, or incarcerated, for their effrontery in taking on Uncle Sam. The Brits don't take the original call seriously and it is the US Navy and SEALS who use overwhelming firepower to crush the pirates. The co-operation of the US military is apparent as operational warships are used to impressive effect.Greengrass and Hanks neatly sidestep the controversy regarding the extent of the real Captain Phillips' heroism. Could he have done more to take a course further from the Somali coast? He is seen considering pirate warning and his route? How well did he handle the physical confrontation itself? Greengrass doesn't dodge the questions, without providing any firm answers, and Hanks assured but understated performance does not portray him as an action hero. The nature of heroism for those placed unexpectedly in fraught situations is always contentious. Invariably individuals simply do their best on very limited information, with luck being an essential ingredient. One of the two pirate skiffs is scared off both by the task of boarding the Alabama and the threat of a Naval response, Muse accuses a fellow pirate of cowardice and kills him in the resulting confrontation. The act of boarding is perilous, mortally dangerous, and exciting, with four armed men taking on a crew of twenty no easy task. Are Muses's actions driven by bravery , greed, or fear of failure? Was Phillips's route chosen by bravery, greed or recklessness?An immensely enjoyable piece of storytelling, this firmly reinforces Greengrass's position in the elite echelon of action film directors. He is a man who can handle a big budget, but places the story and characters first.",8,1,3,8 August 2014
3:10 to Yuma," Affectionate, faithful, modern Western
","In the DVD extras, director James Mangold speaks warmly of the Western genre, its historic appeal and its contemporary relevance. I am not sure whether this production will win any new converts, but it will satisfy those, like myself, who are fond of both the genre, and the greats of the genre which have gone before.A remake, the plot is simple, and in the telling does not stand up to close scrutiny. Yet when the good guy is small time rancher Dan Evans (Christian Bale) and the bad- ass bad guy Ben Wade is Russell Crowe that does not really matter. Shot on location, not on sound stage, the story has an epic sweep to it, the scenery and cinematography is magnificent. With the benefit of a big budget, the action sequences are impressive, and offer the sophistication of modern special effects.Women are in short supply. They are either in the kitchen (Gretchen Mol), or in the bad guy's bed (Vinessa Shaw). Peter Fonda is wonderful in the supporting role of robbery victim, Ben Foster is a wide-eyed menace as baddie lieutenant.At two hours, the story probably runs fifteen minutes too long, but the actors and scenery more than compensate for any lulls. Recommended to all aficionados of Westerns.",7,1,2,17 August 2015
Source Code," A Fine 21st Century Sci Fi Film
","After the commercial ,and critical success of Moon, Director Duncan Jones was handed a bigger budget and bigger story for Source Code. The results are impressive. A student and aficionado of the Science Fiction genre, Jones takes a good plot idea and gives it a 21st century makeover to establish himself as a credible modern protagonist in the field.Writer Ben Ripley's original idea is inspired- that an individual, in a parallel dimension might, for eight minutes, be able to affect the future, but not the past. This is ideal when you are trying to deal with a train and city threatening terrorist. In an amusing spin on Groundhog Day, our hero is able to keep returning until he gets it right, and thwarts the plot. Lead actors Jake Gyllenhaal as Colter Stevens and Michelle Monaghan as Christina Warren lead the action well.Jones worked the confined spaces of space station well in Moon, he also replicates a twist regarding the ambiguity of the exact circumstances of the main character. He replicates that skill well by placing most of the action in a single railway carriage. American Directors notoriously lose their way when given a fistful of dollars, rather than dimes, to finance their films, but not Jones. The money goes on one (frequently reprised) set piece action sequence and a convincing set and cgi. The result is compelling, thought provoking, entertaining and gripping.In a style which will excite Hollywood , the film is intelligent, but never self-indulgent and at 90 minutes is generally tight. Yet it is not flawless. A minor irritation is the inclusion of comic Russell Peters in a cameo role, demonstrably a fairly cynical attempt to create a broader North American market. It is unnecessary as he is not funny, although he apparently kept the cast amused between filming. The more significant failing is an appalling bolted on Hollywood ending that might have undermined the entire film if what had gone before had not been so good. Two excellent opportunities to end the film, a kiss and a freeze frame, are eschewed in favour of absurd schmaltz and a platform for a sequel. This is a shame, because the romance between the leads works well and reeks of a post production fix.",8,1,3,30 December 2012
United 93," Respectful, tense, safe homage
","I approached this film with some trepidation. The US is notoriously flawed, simplistic and introspective in it's international perspective. So I was prepared for a flag waving, navel gazing,sentimental tale safely geared for the home market. I was wrong to do so.Greengrass tells the story straight in real time, and produces a powerful, restrained tale.Several of the performances are by the real people on the ground, giving it an authenticity which is the hallmark of the production.The temptation to demonise the hi jackers is avoided, as is the temptation to flesh out the plane victims characters, and backgrounds, for dramatic effect. Balance wins here, dramatic effect however is reduced.The overall feel is one of a well produced documentary .As such it is a fitting tribute to the people who were unwilling, but heroic, participants in one of the most extraordinary days in modern history. The lack of sensationalism and judgement loses some dramatic power opportunities, but wins in terms of credibility. As an historic document of that day - it is a triumph.",6,3,6,13 January 2007
Deja Vu," Irritatingly Short of Excellent.
","Few films have elicited such contradictory emotions from me.Jerry Bruckheimer and Tony Scott have put together a visually sumptuous and exciting story. Denzil Washington delivers a strong lead performance as Agent Doug Carlin, Val Kilmer,FBI Agent Paul Pryzwarra, actually shows he can do restraint, and Claire Kuchever, as love interest Paula Patton flounces, entertains and is credible as well.So where does it go wrong? The basis of the story, a time 'envelope' allowing us to go backwards in time is fine.However the key question, 'can we alter history by going back in time? ' is ultimately fudged amongst a series of gaping plot holes.Now I am not one to go looking for trouble, and firmly believe that sometimes you should just 'enjoy the ride' of the story that IS being told.But perversely one of the strengths of telling a story backwards is the power of fate, you KNOW how its going to end. This way that power is weakened because your question is 'how is fate going to be distorted?' For me the 'twist' doesn't work, but that does not undermine a good yarn, well told, and brilliantly realised on screen.The critics, and aficionados of this picture are both right. Which side of the fence you end up on is really dependent upon how convincingly the plot grabs you.Irrespective of that, a decent effort by all concerned.",6,1,2,5 May 2008
In Bruges," Literate,Bloody Crime Caper
","In an era when script tends to play a poor second fiddle to visuals, this fine story restores your faith in storytelling. Writer and producer Martin McDonagh already has a distinguished pedigree as a playwright, 'The Lieutenant of Inishmore' being perhaps his finest work to date. When some playwrights bring their craft to the big screen they fail to grasp the possibilities that a space beyond a stage offers them. With McDonagh, he brings the best of the intensity of the stage to the screen.The storyline is simple, two hit men flee London after a job to Bruges, and await instructions.Played by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, the first hour is an absolute joy.They talk, they reflect they discuss in a manner very reminiscent of Travolta and Jackson in Pulp Fiction.Intermittently very violent the film oozes restraint making the bloody outbursts even more shocking.A perverse gunman's morality also underpins everything which passes.Ralph Fiennes has great fun as 'Godfather', Harry in a role which acknowledges that played by Ben Kingsley in 'Sexy Beast'.As is the hallmark of most playwrights, the story has a 'proper' end and is all the more satisfying for it.With Tarrantino and Ritchie seemingly spent forces at the moment the field is open for the likes of McDonagh and the Coen brothers to blaze a trail for 21st Century crime capers.At just over an hour and a half the film also displays a rare discipline as the viewer quickly learns to soak in each setting and each exchange of 'badinage' , so little is wasted.As of early May, my favourite film of 2008.",8,2,5,6 May 2008
Gravity," Vacuous in a vaccum
","Don't believe the hype.I went to see this film wanting to enjoy it. I like space movies, think it is an underrepresented genre currently, and thought that a big budget with Clooney and Bullock would guarantee a worthwhile film. I was wrong.The plot is simple, astronauts working in orbit are threatened by a debris field, catastrophically compromising their mission, and the race is on to come home.Visually the film is sumptuous, the special effects are tremendous, but the dialogue is as vacuous as space itself, and, bereft, of any big idea, the story becomes a little tedious. Much of the film is monologue. If you are either Shakespeare with a gift for soliloquy, or have a challenging proposition as in Duncan Jones' 'Moon' then you can overcome that, but Director and writers Alfonso Cuarón, Jonás Cuarón, are neither.The characters are desperately underwritten. There are a few knowing jokes about Clooney's looks, Bullock is both a top scientist and a dimwit. Yet there is none of the courage of Apollo 13, no wonder of 2001 a Space Odyssey, no intrigue of Moon. This is Hollywood at its worst. Lack of characterisation also results in the scriptwriters' nightmare, we are not that bothered about the fate of the protagonists. Compound that with a lack of jeopardy, and it all becomes a little flat.Some points simply irritate. Many of the spectacular views of earth are unidentifiable, save for a nice shot of the Nile Delta, how a super intelligent scientist fails to realise that opening the hatch door in water will result in a sinking is risible, and the anonymous identity of the landing site is a missed opportunity to build on the international dimension of the story. The 3D effects are perfunctory and lame, a hand coming out of the screen, floating debris, and that is about it.I suspect that there may be a generational aspect to the acclaim this film has received. If you are too young to have seen the great space films of the past, then this rebooting with fine effects may be enough. For the rest of us it is not.",3,0,2,16 November 2013
Lone Survivor," Routine Patriotic rabble Rouser
","This is a formula Hollywood shoot-em-up, more commonly told in the past as a Western or in Vietnam. As a piece of film making it is fine, but well short of classic status. Its popularity is due to its simplicity- the good guys triumph over the bad guys against overwhelming odds with heroic sacrifices and, ostensibly, having occupied the moral high ground.The film-makers had the assistance of the American military, and it shows. The hardware, uniforms and operations are authentic, unfortunately the New Mexico location does not double well for Afghanistan, because of the differences in vegetation.The opening training and team building sequence is pretty much a recruitment advertisement for the American military. There is nothing wrong with that, but it sets a tone which ultimately condemns the final result as routine. The Taleban ( with black turbans) are shown as bad, beheading an informer. The SEALS are shown as good, declining to execute an unarmed goat herding party that stumble upon them with mortal consequences for the group. At the end, villagers sympathetic to the Americans save the day ( wearing white turbans) and the Taleban are ritually routed with some USA shock and awe Apache and fixed wing gunships.As in any good western, the bad guys die with every shot and are tactically inept, the good guys sustain multiple gunshot and other injuries but fight on. Patriotism, valour and rugged determination are the order of the day, with three good guys dead, but dozens of bad guys wasted to sweeten the pill.First and foremost this is a piece of patriotic entertainment, and it scores highly as such. But beyond that the American public are cheated of the bigger picture. The Afghan people did nothing to warrant having their country invaded and occupied again ( Saudi Arabia post 9/11 would have been a bit awkward). Locals collaborating with invading forces have never been popular, the Americans themselves were not that impressed having the British on their soil. Are Afghans, unimpressed by having foreign execution squads on their soil, really the bad guys? Furthermore, do local militia, battle hardened by fighting the Russians, on home turf, really make such easy targets?I have much time for America as a country, and its people. But they do occasionally deserve some war films a little more thought provoking than this.Director Peter Berg has a distinguished film making record behind him and acquits himself well with the story and action. Although Mark Wahlberg is the eponymous Lone Survivor, he is by no means the star in a well- cast team effort. The action sequences are dynamic and riveting, but the crudely set context lets it down both in terms of the enemy, and the ineffective rescue response. This film is perfect for the 'Call of Duty' crowd, but unsatisfying for those hoping for something a little more cerebral.",4,5,9,13 July 2014
Star Trek," A Superb Reinvention of the Series
","Director JJ Abrams is not the obvious choice to make a success of this film. Steeped in the episodic nature of TV serial 'Lost' and with 'Cloverfield' a divisive project, handing $150m dollars to him was a risk. But the risk has paid off triumphantly.He has produced an exciting reinvention of the original to set the scene for how it all began.For aficionados, the characters are faithfully represented, yet with the twist that their younger persona's can be explored. Thus a young rebellious, hot headed Kirk is brilliantly played out by Chris Pine,and the 'sex on legs' Uhuru is sassily strutted by Zoe Saldana.It is easy to forget that her part was the first mainstream, principal female black character seen on American TV.Improbably, the Studios paid as much attention to the plot as to the special effects. Consequently we are given a visual feast as a backdrop for a coherent, believable well executed story. Divulging too much plot may spoil things for the uninitiated, suffice to say it has a pleasant surprise and Star trek traditions are maintained.Unusually there are also a few ' laugh out loud' jokes.A treat for old fans, and wholly digestible for the uninitiated, a sequel at least is both guaranteed, and deserved.",9,1,10,18 May 2009
Fury," Ruined by a Preposterous Ending.
","Ruined by a Preposterous Ending.There are not that many films about Allied tank crews, and the idea has potential with the cramped confines of a tank doubling for those of a submarine, and submarine films, with their claustrophobic intensity have a rich history. Director David Ayer has a distinguished action track record behind him, and was behind the commercially successful, but historically risible, U 571.It tells the story, warts and all, of an American tank crew in the final push into Germany. Authentic to a fault, Brad Pitt is suitably muscular as the tank commander, Shia Lebeouf shades the acting honours though as the reluctant rookie.Ayer handles the story, and the action sequences well. The gruesome reality of war is well told. But he loses the plot as the story rolls to its climax. Modern audiences are beyond the good guys surviving and triumphing over overwhelming odds, yet at the end, Ayer cannot resist the 'against the odds' shoot out, and the SS are caricatured as evil, but inept, fighters.Without the preposterous ending, 'Fury' would be a creditable 7/10, with it, it slips to a lazy 5/10.",5,1,6,30 June 2015
Darkest Hour," Terrific Historial Drama
","This story follows closely Christopher Nolan's ' Dunkirk'. In that film, Churchill barely makes an appearance, in 'The Darkest Hour' Dunkirk doesn't make an appearance. Perhaps the two should be combined?Gary Oldman is sensational as Churchill. His career has some difficult moments in retrospect. Director Joe Wright circumvents this by concentrating on a few weeks, Great Britain's Darkest Hour, when Western Europe had capitulated to the Nazi war machine, the USA sat on its hands, and the British army was about to be wiped out in France.Oldman is complimented by some fine supporting, if underwritten, roles. Kirsten Scott Thomas is cruelly underused as Churchill's wife, eking the maximum out of her few minutes of screen time. As Halifax, Stephen Dillane is magnificent in a superbly oleaginous portrayal. Ben Mendelsohn develops King George V from foe to friend in quick time.The political scenes are atmospheric and terrific, the oratory a reminder of how powerful a good speech can be. Lily James is easy on the eye as Churchill's secretary, but the part feels clunky. It pulls a pretty young woman into the story, but does little else. Adie Haastrup's part as the only black face in the film feels a little contrived in the tube carriage scene which itself feels very contrived.Yet these quibbles are part of the films strength. Wright has crafted a drama out of great raw material, the two hour running time flies by.",8,0,2,3 February 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Bloody Brilliant
","A glorious return to form for maverick Director Qunetin Tarantino. It's not perfect, but firmly puts him back in the A list of hot cinematic property.His vision for the whole film teeters on the preposterous occasionally, but always steps back from the brink. But the real strength of this film is what QT does best, brilliantly envisioned scenes, with superb dialogue. And that is what the film opens with. A scene as good, if not better, than anything he has ever realised before. The war time set piece of an SS Officer visiting a Partisan hiding Jews has been done many times before, with bear traps of cliché waiting to spring at any moment. But in the hands of Tarantino's marvellous, quirky script, strong Direction, and superb acting from Christophe Waltz as SS Colonel Hans Landa, we are treated to a cinematic tour de force.Indeed Landa is the pivotal figure throughout.Measured, urbane and systematic, the exact opposite of Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine and his renegade crew of Nazi exterminators. A feature of the film is a core of actors giving fine, straight performances whilst the periphery deliver cameo and pastiche.Although the trademark violence is gruesomely dished out another trademark is in evidence. Tarantino loves women. Check out the vertical ,moving overhead shot of Melanie Laurent as she strides along with her beautiful red dress flaring out as she walks as Jewess Shusanna, or Julie Dreyfus as Goebbels translator / Courtesan with killer clothes and heels, or the gorgeous Diane Kruger as German film star and double agent Bridget Von Hammersmark, the epitome of 40's Movie Star chic. He has this gift for allowing women and scenes to exude sex, without being explicit. Think Thurman / Travolta in the 'dancing competition' scene in Pulp Fiction, or Jackie Brown as Pam Grier sashays along in her smart, skirted Air Hostess uniform.At two hours twenty minutes ,the action skips along with surprisingly little violence, but when it does feature, it is gruesome. The action sequences are as effective as those in Paul Verhoeven's, 'Black Book', THE finest modern WW2 film to date. And although about killing Nazis, the most compelling character is SS officer Landa. Laurent and Kruger make the most of meaty roles which transcend the 'Love interest' parts so typical of contemporary work.Faults? The final knife wounding scene and explicit baseball bat murder were too extreme for my tastes. His decision to include caricatures of the German Top Brass, including Hitler,came close to verging on comedy sometimes. This quasi-comic quality was also present in the pompous puffed up English Officers but was also dished out to the 'Inglorious Basterds' as a whole.This is no 'Americans as Heroes' picture. Subversively, Daniel Bruhl as enlisted marksman and Celebrated War Hero Frederick Zoller is given a far more rounded and sympathetic treatment.The judicious use of sub-titles gives proceedings a credibility so absent from,genre stablemate , 'Valkyrie' with Brad Pitt easily trumping Tom Cruise in choice of roles, and film.Easily one of the best releases of 2009, and worth seeing for the first 15 minutes alone.",8,2,12,19 August 2009
World War Z," A Z Movie
","This is a Zombie apocalypse movie on a worldwide scale, an idea based on a book by Max Brooks. I enjoy the pivotal movies of the genre, in particular the likes of the Omega Man and Romero's Zombies series. A summer blockbuster budget offering it does not lack in spectacle, ambition and special effects. As such it works pretty well. However as a contribution to the Zombie body of work it is poor.Director Marc Forsters' credentials are illuminating. He handled the big budget of Quantum of Solace satisfactorily, but added little to the tradition of Bond in a fairly soul less movie. The Kite Runner, a much smaller budget with a far better script, was a great success though. Here his ambition of a worldwide epic never gets started. The opening United States sequence is strong enough, but the characterisation of Brad Pitt's persona, Gerry Lane, is shallow, his family are simply irritating. On more than one occasion I hoped that his children were devoured in a single zombie bite. So as the family backstory bites, so irritation levels rise. When the action moves to the Middle East the sequences are impressive and exciting, but the final forty minutes are devoted to a cat and mouse denouement which should have lasted four minutes.If you are looking for a big budget spectacular, you will not be too disappointed. If you are looking for a strong plot, a great screenplay and a compelling zombie story you will be very disappointed.",3,1,3,8 October 2014
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," An Enjoyable Adult Comedy
","Generally American comedy films specialise in 'gross out' humour, British ones in a more subtle, wordy version. This plays largely to type but with a nice twist, with the twist being British actor Russell Brand who does both.Producer Judd Apatow specialises in a puerile, obvious humour which was successfully exploited in Knocked Up, The 40 year old virgin,and Superbad,all of which have enjoyed considerable commercial success.Afficiandos will not be disappointed. Mens genitalia are supposed to be funny, and spoof blow job videos hilarious.Yet in this simple romp emerges a comedy which does have its moments.Anti-hero,and writer, Jason Segel pretty much plays it straight as jilted Peter Bretter to a very pretty, but less than convincing Kristen Bell as Sarah Marshall.However the stand out turn comes from Russell Brand, almost playing himself, as Rock Star Aldous Snow. Brand offers a performance of swagger, style, panache and braggadocio which steals every scene he is in. He has all the best lines and knocks a solid supporting love interest role performance from Mila Kunis as Rachael Jansen solidly into touch.Neatly combining wild excess, with witty wordy observations,Brand romps through the role in the same way that he would through a nunnery!Some odd editing, and clunky scene changes do not detract from some very good, and funny, set pieces, and the story stops thankfully short of any moralising.The four hander between the 'foursome' at dinner is by far the stand out scene with brand coming to terms with a particularly offensive 'shirt as gift' with the memorable cry 'take my eyes but not my shirt' to an over eager waiter.Not a 'big screen' essential by any means,but well worth a look nonetheless.",6,3,11,4 May 2008
Public Enemies," 1930's Chicago Revisited in Style
","Eighty years after the events, Michael Mann takes on the Period Chicago Gangster genre, and wins, with this entertaining story. Do not be put off by some churlish carping from the critics, much of which is generated by the very high standards that Mann's films are now judged. The lengthy 140 minute running time flies by leaving the audience wondering about what could have been added to the story, not what should have been omitted.Essentially this is the story of the life, in his heyday, and death of Gangster John Dillinger. It bounces along, leaving little room for back story or leisurely character development, like Dillinger,it lives for the moment. Johhny Depp is superb as Dillinger, Christian Bale a thoroughly convincing Melvin Purvis, his taciturn but determined G-Man nemesis.A plot curio is that some time is given over to J Edgar Hoover's fight to establish an FBI with Purvis operating as his local enforcer.But the role is under developed, it could be dropped with no impact on the plot, making you wonder how much extra footage was left on the cutting room floor, hopefully set for an appearance on the DVD.Marion Cotillard, a native Frenchwoman, plays the part of the leading lady, and Dillingers love interest, well enough. In a role which offers infrequent appearances, she conforms to the genre requirements of being easily bedded, hit, and cries on demand.Critics have queried the way that the digital film is shot.There is none of the lushness of 'last of the Mohicans', nor the grittiness of 'Collateral', but the compelling plot leaves little time to worry about that.Review audiences also complained of poor sound quality and mumbled dialogue, not faults that I could identify with on this showing.The 'showdown' between Dillinger and Purvis happens early on, in a scene which is played straight and without lingering fanfare, it is certainly no re-run of De Niro v Pacino in 'Heat'.If the film lacks anything it is a sense of Tragedy, so wonderfully apparent in De Palma's 'Carlitos Way'. Depp and Purvis are played so ruthlessly and efficiently by Depp and Bale that pathos and emotional attachment are on pretty short display.The period is lovingly recreated by Mann and the action sequences, unsurprisingly, never fail to disappoint, indeed when Dillinger is first shown robbing a bank his vault over the counter is seen in graceful slow motion. Diana Krall has a pleasing cameo as a nightclub torch singer performing 'Bye Bye Blackbird' and the costumes are a consistent delight.Punchy, light on its feet and offering weighty roles for Depp and Bale, this will be enjoyed by ardent fans and the curious alike.",8,102,193,3 July 2009
The Other Boleyn Girl," Powerful Costume Drama
","The story of the six wives of Henry the Eigth is a staple of British history. Director Justin Chaswick , who cut his teeth on period drama with a TV production of 'Bleak House', makes an excellent job of converting Phillipa Gregory's novel, in which she picks out the Boleyn girls contribution, onto the Big screen. Much of the credit for this goes to Peter Morgan whose fine screenplay confirms his status of one of the best writers of screen dialogue around at the moment.Whilst historically inaccurate in some key respects, the context is enough to provide a convincing and rewarding 'faction'.Two hours of intrigue, treachery, plotting and heartbreak focus on the efforts of the Boleyn family to do a spot of social climbing courtesy of their daughters Anne and Mary. Natalie Portman as the former, leaves Scarlett Johansson as the latter somewhat in her wake in a towering performance of froideur and ambition. Eric Bana as King Henry is absolutely convincing is his arrogant amorality, yet still allows the side of him which can be manipulated by women to shine through.Lavish, whilst falling short of being a full blown costume drama, the story depends upon plot , rather than action, and succeeds triumphantly. The below par CGI recreations of Medieval Cityscapes are more than compensated for by a rip roaring pace to a cleverly paced tale. My only criticism is that the cerebral battle between Henry and his wife Catherine, and the visceral passion of his relationships with Anne and Mary are somewhat under drawn, presumably to give it as wide an audience as possible with a 12A rating.However the ingredients of a King, mistresses, a scheming Court and razor sharp dialogue deliver an impressive result, which I can recommend to all.",7,0,1,9 February 2009
Black Book," Tremendous Wartime Drama for the 21st Century
","Forget the English sub- titles for this Dutch language film. Fast paced, dramatic, twisting and edgy, this is a marvellous revamp of the traditional 'Resistance' genre, easily the best film I have seen in ages.The Director Paul Verhoeven has a distinguished English language film career behind him, the best of which is echoed and reworked to great effect. From the 'Hollow Man' we have the sense of emptiness and isolation of the main character. From 'Starship Troopers', 'Total Recall' and 'Robocop' we have tremendous all action set pieces bursting onto the screen like firecrackers. From 'Showgirls' and 'Basic Instinct' we have the salacious sexiness of some pleasingly gratuitous sequences.The Wartime period is lovingly recreated as the lack of goofs and trivia comments testify ! The tale is essentially that of a wartime Jewess, Rachel Ellis - brilliantly performed by Carice Van Houten - her hiding, and her journey into the hands of the Dutch Resistance to avenge her tragic experiences.Distance provides perspective and the Dutch Resistance and liberation is not played in straight patriotic mode. Political, personal and conscientious differences are all shown between the fighters with greed and self preservation knowing no National boundaries ! Indeed one of the most sympathetically drawn characters is the SS Commander, Muntze - carefully played by Sebastian Koch. A philatelist and pragmatist, he emerges with more dignity than most amidst a twisting, swirling plot. When Ellis has to seduce Muntze there is a preceding 'Basic Instinct' moment when she is seen not only dying her hair, but her pubic hair. She remonstrates with a fellow Resistance fighter not to look - but you cant help! Traditionally this type of film as practised in the forties, fifties, and sixties was slow and laconic. This whips along, totally carrying it's two and a half hour running time. The plot is dense, thus making a second viewing very rewarding, but hey, you have to see it for the first time, and that is exactly what you should do !",9,10,14,26 January 2007
127 Hours," An Honourable Failure
","I am a huge fan of Director Danny Boyle's work, but this time around he tried something different, and didn't quite succeed. Tackling a story which centres on a largely motionless man deep in a ravine is a big challenge, and is not one which he successfully overcomes. Lead actor James Franco as Aron Ralston does well enough but there is not an awful lot to go on.Based on a true story the film opens up with shots of him as an adrenaline junkie, mountain biking in the Utah desert and canyoneering, long distance running across it. Curiously, in real life he was an able graduate in Mechanical Engineering and French, although that intelligence is never revealed to counter some fairly reckless behaviour.The scenery is fantastic, and the opening act when he chances upon two girls and leads them part of the way is Boyle at his best, playful, pacey and eventful, if a little unlikely. But inevitably once Ralston is trapped, the dramatic options are a bit limited. To his credit, Boyle eschews 'faction' scenes of encounters with cougars, snakes, near misses by passing helicopters and half heard voices of walkers – but in fact that does not leave much. We have a storm scene whose dramatic and cinematic potential is underplayed, and then the inevitable self-mutilation.Flash backs pre-dominate and hallucinations unfold, but we never really know enough about Ralston to really care. Then when he does escape from the boulder, a demanding 20m descent is dealt with in a perfunctory manner, he stumbles across some walkers, a helicopter arrives – and that is it. No denouement, no context. It all feels a little unsatisfactory, a bit like the Billboard Poster which is an invention and depicts no physical part of the film.The music is also poor. Discordant and jarring, it's use as a high octane accompaniment to the biking works, but otherwise it does not work well to try to crank up some artificial excitement. The self-amputation is gruesome and graphically depicted in all of Boyle's gory glory, but that isn't enough in a running time which at 94 minutes feels simultaneously long, and incomplete.",5,14,28,11 January 2011
Pirate Radio," Deeply Disappointing Disjointed Drivel
","I wanted to enjoy this.I used to listen to Radio Caroline, I love the music of the era and am a huge fan of Richard Curtis's work - a sure fire combination.But it was not, and I was left reflecting on this 'Deeply Disappointing Disjointed Drivel'.The music is wonderful.Curtis is a fine writer, but an undisciplined one, and a strong Director would have tightened up this ship no end.For a film with a plot that comprises: DJ's on a Pirate radio ship, government tries half heartedly to close them down, greenhorn discovers his long lost father is on ship, ship sinks, the 2hour 10 minute running time is inexcusable.I did not laugh once.The comic situations offer pallid echoes of Curtis's best work.Tom Sturridge plays a young ill at ease fop in a sub Hugh Grant role,a bumbling Government underling is named Twatt, a poor imitation of the 'Darling' device in Blackadder as is Thick Kevin a poor imitation of Baldrick from the same series.A strong ensemble cast offer little warmth and drift in and out like the Pirate Radio signal itself used to.The last 20 minutes is bizarrely cranked up to offer an ending synthesising the likes of 'Titanic', 'The Poseidon Adventure' and 'Das Boot' making the whole enterprise even more risible.The Boat rocked - the plot and script sank.",2,84,164,11 April 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Visceral Comic Book Mayhem
","A visually lavish, special effects laden, feast offering more than enough to keep genre fans satisfied. Director Gavin Hood, after his assured mainstream debut with 'rendition' will surely have the studios after him as he delivers the goods in blockbuster format.The opportunities raised by 'going back to the beginning' are largely eschewed in favour of big set piece action scenes, with some of the scene setting sequences bewildering. Lyn Collins, as Silverfox is cruelly under used in a curiously emotionless picture. The fraternal relationship between Wolverine and Victor lies largely unexplored, until we are reminded that 'brothers look after each other'.Skillful, well paced editing combined with tremendous action sequences keep the 107 minutes zipping along, but ultimately this is for aficionados only. Fewer explosions, and greater characterisation, would have gone a long way.Under developed and over produced is a neat summary,8/10 for the visuals, 3/10 for the story.",5,4,10,4 May 2009
Hot Fuzz," Desperately Disappointing
","I went along to this movie with high expectations, but low preconceptions. i was sorely disappointed with what I saw. The premise of the film was fine - a spoof involving an over zealous City Cop unleashed into the strange ways of a quiet backwater village. However the fundamental problem is that it is not that funny. Combine this with an overlong 2 hour running time and you are in trouble. The golden rule of comedy films is that no matter how good the content, they don't overrun 90 minutes. This one overshot by 30 minutes and was really a tight 45 minute idea.The Director, Edgar Wright had a cross over cult hit with 'Shaun of the Dead' - interestingly the remainder of his work has been more miss than hit. However on the strength of the success of 'Shaun', a pretty strong cast was assembled including Bilie Whitelaw, Bill Nighy and Timothy Dalton. Valliantlly as they perform though, there is only so much that they can do with a pretty thin script.Fot film aficionados there are references to other Cop Movies, and in jokes galore, with a pleasingly eclectic score to go with it. However the cod gore fest of some of the village 'accidents' reprising 'Shaun ' moments are really sub 'Scary Movie ' stuff. And the Gonzo Police action scenes tire quickly.Ironically the funniest moment for me was the most under stated. He goes into the village pub for the first time, empties it by clearing out all the under age drinkers, then orders a Cranberry Juice.To be fair the 16 year olds in the Theatre thought the film was 'mental' - and the plot is undeniably a good premise. But the execution is undisciplined and gratuitously slack hence my unusually low rating.",2,15,41,24 February 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Bloated Finale
","I am a huge fan of Pirate films as a genre, and loved the first POTC installment. The second one seemed like half a film to me, so i was keenly waiting the conclusion of this tale. I could not have been more disappointed.It is easy to forget that the first film focused on the roguish charm and wit of Jack Sparrow, told a coherent story, was well plotted, pacey, and had few special effects. 'worlds End' has grown into a bloated monster, fat on the success of the first two installments. Hugely impressive, and expensive, special effects have dwarfed the plot such that Sparrow has been relegated into little more than a bystander in this juggernaut of a CGI driven picture.Many of the scenes were shot during last years filming of the second 'Dead Mans Chest', and apparently the script had not been finalised at that point. It shows. This franchise has become a 'Mision Impossible' style enterprise whereby the set pieces are put together first, and then joined up by a script that tries to make some sense of it.Sadly, i do hope that this is the end for this series.The English Rose innocence of Keira Knightley now seems wet, her attempts at being Action Woman risible. And as for Orlando Bloom, he is about as dashing as Larry Grayson, as he hangs around to win his lady's heart. Jack, previously the vibrant life of every frame has been sidelined by a tidal wave of special effects that are simply there because the money is there to provide them , rather than because of any dramatic imperative.Farewell, and bon voyage - i will remember the good times.",3,1,3,28 May 2007
Zodiac," Worthy But Turgid
","Fincher is one of the best directors around at the moment. His credentials include Alien 3, Fight Club, Seven, Panic Room and the massively under rated The Game. Stylistically, and technically, the film is fine. But by his own high standards it is a dramatic failure.The opening third of a long 2 hour 49 min running time shows him at his best. The violence is shocking, malevolent and unsettling with the audience sharing the bewilderment of the time. Whio is the killer ? Why is he doing this? What are the links ? When is he going o strike next? Then the problems start.Essentally this is the story of Grayson the cartoonist turned author and his quest to unmask the Zodiac killer. But this takes over twenty years, the contact from Zodiac is episodic, and the genuine killings all take place at the front end of the picture.Grayson does have a complex story to tell - and Fincher tells it. But ultimately in so doing he kills the dramatic tension of the tale. A journalistic maxim is 'never let the facts get in the way of a good story' and this applies here.The labyrinthine detective work begins to collapse under its own investigative weight leaving space really only for devoted 'Zodiacphiles' but not the standard cinema goer.Surprisingly Fincher chooses to pass on two of the most dramatic moments of the story. The moment when two patrol car officers pass the Zodiac killer after he has slain the taxi driver is recounted but not portrayed, and the heart attack death of the prime suspect is told by post film postscript ! The soundtrack is wonderful 'Hurdy Gurdy Man', Santana et al, as is the acting and dialogue.But ultimately an intriguing story does not necessarily make a great film, as is evidenced here.",4,6,9,28 May 2007
Cloverfield," Pretentious Pap
","Don't believe the hype.Advocates of this movie swoon at the hand held camera work, bitty narrative, and edgy imagery.They are wrong. This is a classic case of the Emperors New Clothes, all style and no substance.It is telling that Director Matt Reeve's previous claim to fame was Under Siege 2 (straight to video) and writer Drw Goddards credentials revolve around being a producer on TV Bore fest 'Lost'. It shows.The hand held camera work is fine for the opening 'party' Act, although I would have left the party during its 20 minute duration.The characters are sketched as quirky and diverse, like a scene setting episode of 'Lost', but lack any warmth or emotional interest. I was willing them ALL to die half way through the film.However when the action kicks in the camera work is firstly nausea inducing, secondly it is used to artificially create a drama and tension which is not in the narrative.Matt Reeve, by dipping us into this tale and then suddenly dipping us out is essentially telling a short story. And he is not good enough to carry a short story on film off.It fails at virtually every level.I was checking my watch every 10 minutes or so, a good indicator of how poorly the film engages with its audience.A film I will NEVER watch again. A Director whose films I shall actively avoid in future.",1,0,1,8 September 2008
The Expendables," Disposable
","Sly Stallone has been in a lot of films in his career, most have been poor, a few ( Copland, Cliffhanger, Rambo First Blood and Rocky) have been good. This is another addition to the poor list. The power of Hollywood legends is considerable. When Sly decided that he wanted to write, direct and star in this movie no-one was strong enough to say no. The result reeks of self indulgence.The story, such as it is, is perfunctory. An 'A Team' style collection of ageing hard men is called upon to deal with a South American traitor, laced with a risible sub-plot involving CIA double dealing. Obviously this involves a lot of explosions and people being blown up – but that is about it. Apart from some good action sequences, including a questionable obsession with knives, precious little entertains.An opening sequence in which 'the expendables' free hostages held by pirates is quite promising, but thereafter it is only when guns are blazing, knives are slashing and things are blowing apart that any interest is created. To describe the characters as one dimensional would be generous. Arnold Schwarzenegger has a walk on part which is little more than an excuse for a gag. Jet Li's martial arts skills are woefully underemployed, his presence is little more than a lever to secure interest in the far east. Mickey Rourke reminded us in the Wrestler what a good actor he is, here he has nothing to do of note. Bruce Willis looks smug, about what I am unsure. Dolph Lungren is simply awful, Jason Statham provides a modicum of respectability with some semblance of character and conviction.Stallone himself tries too much. The story is not up to it, nor is the dreadful dialogue. Why these men are 'expendable' is largely unclear, and anything which is not an action set-piece falls flat. Naturally Stallone gets to gaze into the eyes of the female lead, Charisma Carpenter, who looks considerably younger than her years. Crucially we don't really care about any of the characters, it is nor well written enough for that. Furthermore the good v evil axis is unconvincing. Are ageing mercenaries the good guys? Are all South American Dictators bad guys? Is the shadowy rogue ex-CIA man bad or good? And you end up not really being bothered either way",Null,12,24,1 August 2011
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Bloody Brilliant
","A stellar ensemble delivers a cinematic delight as Director Tim Burton delivers his trademark unique twists to this traditional tale. The dark cinematography, and cartoon like CGI, creates a wonderfully chaotic, and grim 19th Century London. The music and lyrics are the work of veteran songs smith Stephen Sondheim, in a production where a significant part of the plot is sung through, which may put some people off. However I found it a joy to have a high quality musical score underwriting a good story, well told.Johnny Depp plays the eponymous role and is fast becoming the leading actor of his generation. His London accent is quite good, if alarmingly close to that of Jack Sparrow, from Pirates of the Caribbean. His charming, but deranged Barber is a wonderful creation, which he has much fun with. His Mistress is played by a sleazily over the top Helena Bonham-Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen has a marvellous cameo as a cod-Italian travelling snake oil salesman. Judge Turpin, the 'baddie' is inevitably played by Alan Rickman who excels in a small role, ably assisted by the portly Timothy Spall, his sidekick.Essentially a Musical Horror film, Burton revels in the blood drenched plot with plenty of humorous visual gags to assuage the slaughter which unfold before us. The macabre and gory detail might be too much in less experienced hands but the artificial dreamlike quality of the Cinematography steers the audience away from the verite which if portrayed in a realistic setting would have been very uncomfortable.A fine effort from one of the most original and imaginative Directors working today.",7,1,2,20 February 2010
The Town," Above Average Heist Movie
","An above average 'Heist' movie confidently directed by Ben Afleck who also takes the lead. Set in Boston, Affleck plays a career bank robber, Doug Macray, from the run down district of Charlestown, which is home to the criminal fraternity in general, and bank robbing aficionados in particular. The generous running time of 125 mins contains only three raids because, wisely, the story based on the Chuck Hogan novel 'Prince of Thieves', concentrates on character rather than action and takes time to enjoy the location sets in Boston itself.Charlestown is a tight knit community to which Affleck's gang return after a brilliant, visceral opening Bank raid. To English ears, the dialogue is sometimes mumbled and difficult to follow, but when a hostage is freed who it emerges also lives in Charlestown, the plot bites as MacRay starts to date the hostage and is easy to follow. Time worn themes of criminal codes of honour, redemption, justice and revenge are explored with a blue collar authenticity which just begs Bruce Springsteen to step out of the shadows at any time.Rebecca Hall as Claire skilfully unfolds the role of bank official turned unwitting girlfriend ,delivering a compelling, but understated performance even though her own back story is somewhat under written. Pete Postlethwaite is wonderful in a cameo as the local godfather in a ballsy performance, in every sense of the phrase.No such story would be complete without the Cop determined to bring the hoodlums to justice and John Hamm is convincing as FBI agent Hawley whose task in racking down the offenders is not that difficult. Why both he and McCray have to sport unshaven beard growth is never quite explained.A gripe is the Hollywood obsession with over the top shoot-outs. Although the opening bank raid, and subsequent security van raid are brilliant, the finale at the Boston Red Sox ' Fenway Park becomes ridiculous and unconvincing, and is wholly unnecessary to a well plotted story. Fortunately an action free, but engrossing and satisfying denouement save the story from the ridicule it risks at Fenway Park.Strong, and atmospheric, with several nods to 'Heat' this movie succeeds and delivers in spades suggesting that in the future Affleck will make a film that scores excellent, and not just the 'very good' plaudits which this story has rightly been credited with..",7,0,2,19 October 2010
Shutter Island," A Satisfying Beautifully Crafted Psychological Thriller
","A fine psychological thriller which sees both Director Martin Scorsese and lead actors Ben Kingsley and Leo Di Caprio on fine form. The fact that this film was released almost a year after it was finished gave rise to rumours that something was amiss with the artistic merits of this project. Those rumours were misplaced.The plot is somewhat formulaic. Although the screenplay and direction hint broadly at what is coming next, the delivery and impact of the twists and turns is always compelling. Federal Marshall Daniels, Di Caprio,and sidekick Chuch Aule, played by Mark Ruffalo, arrive on Shutter Island , a secure psychiatric facility, to investigate the escape of a patient as storm clouds gather in the sky. Yet as his investigations advance, so questions about why he is there, what is happening at the facility and what his role is mount. Scorsese reprises his use of the weather, nature and scenery, which he skilfully exploited in his remake of Cape Fear to great effect.Kingsley is superb as Psychiatrist Dr Cawley. His measured and assured tones perfect for the role. Even when Daniels blows up his car he simply remarks that he was 'quite fond of that car', one of the few moments of humour in what is quite a dark film. Set in 1954, and with flashbacks to both wartime, and personal , trauma, there is an air of 'other worldliness' about proceedings ,which has an insidious cumulative effect of all pervading paranoia. Robbie Robertson's foreboding score excels in supporting that discordant atmosphere.The two hour and twenty minute running time never, drags and climaxes with a convincing and powerful final act with directing and acting talent at full throttle. All is revealed, contributing to a satisfying finale whilst still leaving a few elements of doubt. Recommended.",8,1,3,23 March 2010
Forrest Gump," Stodgy and Over Rated
","This is one of those rare films of which I am very aware, but had never seen. Nineteen years on I decided to put it right. Director Robert Zemeckis has gone on to have a distinguished career and is a Hollywood stalwart, a traditionalist in the Spielberg mould. Unfortunately, as the story unfolded, i became aware that my subconscious had been a shrewd judge of what I enjoy.As a modern day, conservative, fairy tale it is well crafted , easy on the eye, tugging at the heartstrings and rich in warmth. But the sub-text is as stodgy as a toffee chocolate. Gump, a man of modest talent, but great determination and opportunism, triumphs in life. We never see the Commies in Vietnam, just Gump's bravery, we do see those subversive anti-war protesters and Black Panthers though, but even dim Gump manages to see his way through.Told in flashback, and with amusing and inspired manipulated archive footage to put Forrest at the heart of historic action , much pivots upon Forrests's star crossed relationship with a girl, played by Robin Wright. Gary Sinise shines as Lieutenant Dan Taylor. Yet for me the sentimentality is mawkish, the message awkward and simplistic, and the treatment a cynical manipulation of the audience that loves The American Dream. Its appeal is obvious. Its claims to greatness over stated.",4,2,5,11 August 2013
The Bourne Ultimatum," Tremendous Trilogy Finale
","When the Bourne Identity came out I was as impressed as anyone with the clever storyline,fine acting, and pacey, often innovative, action sequences. However the Bourne Supremacy, which I had assumed was a 'cash in ' sequel lost me, mainly because the narrative was poor, and the sense of purpose in the story was lost. Well, this third installment puts that right with spades, and works both as the end of a trilogy, and as a stand alone piece.Matt Damon proves what a fine actor he is. Although an action hero, he always seems to avoid cliché and formula in the role. Cleverly, because the essence of the story is the search for his 'identity', it is also a search for his soul. So although the action sequences are frequently quite brutal, he never succumbs to the Schwarzenegger 'automaton' style of action hero.Although awash with surveillance gadgetry, the story eschews hi tech killing methods, and is far the better for it. The thrill is in the chase. David Strathairn, who has a gargantuan list of film acting credits behind him, is tremendous as the maverick Deputy CIA Chief,Noah Vosen. Joan Allen,as his nemesis Pamela Landy, is superb as his nemesis, and proves that there is a place for women over 50 in modern movies. By contrast, Julia Stiles as erstwhile love interest Nicky Parsons, has a curiously underwritten, functional role.Not cerebral, but visceral entertainment. Much cleverer than the Mision Impossible franchise. and a for once plausible cross Atlantic contrast to James Bond.",7,3,6,19 August 2007
Bohemian Rhapsody," Great Expdctations - Mediocre Reality
","I had been looking forwards to this. Queen were a great band, the reviews had been enthusiastic, but the experience of watching it fell short of my expectations.The entire film felt contrived, a construct by Brian May and Roger Taylor. The pre Live Aid schism was inadequately explained, and flawed , the gratuitous multicultural crowd shots during Live Aid were historically inaccurate. The narrative a disjointed cut and paste.Mercury's compulsive sexual behaviour is awkwardly shown, as is his personal relationship with manager John Reid, whose character was poorly written, particularly in contrast to his portrayal in the Elton John biopic 'Rocketman'. Aiden Gillen's Reid here is insipid, and anonymous. There is no hint of his business or sexual prowess, Richard Madden's portrayal in 'Rocketman' smoulders.The making of the film was disrupted by a false start with Sacha Baron Cohen dropping out as Freddie, and veteran Hollywood Producer Bryan Singer also leaving for Dexter Fletcher to complete the project. It shows. Current Queen manager Jim Beach is on the production team ensuring that the image is as favourable as possible. It feels like a feature length promo.I found Rami Malek as Freddie irritating, superficial and lightweight. The dynamic of his relationship with Sarah Austin never worked, or was convincing. Lucy Boynton as Sarah Austin performs well, and looks good, yet she feels like a plot device, rather than a person. Malek is strong in being fey and affected, weak in demonstrating the force that Mercury was.As a film, rather than documentary, it has clearly succeeded. The music is strong, memorable and well presented. But I found the work as a whole unsatisfying.Comparisons with the contemporaneously released 'Rocketman' are inevitable. The distinction is clear. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' relies upon the personality of a dead man, and is produced by third parties with a personal interest in the favourable depiction of their supporting roles. 'Rocketman' is an Elton John project in which he dares to bare his soul rather than rely upon the music to carry the day.'Bohemian Rhapsody' taught me nothing. There were no facts or insights of which I was unaware as a music fan. Following the success of the musical 'We will Rock You' the film was the logical last piece in the artistic Queen jigsaw. As a stand-' alone music film it is pretty good, but only because of the live music sequences, particularly Live Aid. Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page must look on ruefully at the way in which Brian May has kept the money tree blossoming without Mercury.",3,5,10,8 February 2020
Burn After Reading," An Intelligent. Quirky, Surreal Delight
","This film will not be to everyones taste, and I wholly understand the polarised responses.A star studded cast enjoy a knowing, wordy script, where dialogue counts, a Coen brothers trademark.However not very much happens, and the narrative is disjointed, so the pace of the story is very staccato.But once again the result is something very wide of the Hollywood mainstream and is all the more satisfying for it.A 95 minute running time,, and several separate but interwoven plots, mean that screen time for individual actors is limited. Consequently each shines in their given roles, relishing the word play and eking the maximum out of each situation.No scene is dwelled upon, and the occasional bloody outburst of violence, or titillating appearance of a Sybian machine , is shown then moved on from before you have time to work out exactly what is going on.The script is littered with double entendres, 'running gags (pun intended)and lines aimed straight at the audience from the screen. No-one knows what is going on, or what has gone on, or what is going to happen, and is all the better for it.A mini-masterpiece.",9,81,138,17 October 2008
28 Weeks Later," Irritating but Inventive Sequel
","After the shortcomings of the recently released 'Sunshine', Garland and Boyle, the Executive Producers give further evidence that their talent doesn't quite match their ambition.A sequel to the limited, but well delivered 28days later, was merited.A sci fi film set in a contemporary Britain riven by virus crazed zombies/ crazies is worth revisiting. Initially the opening sequence when Robert Carlyle, the lead, is besieged by lightning quick vicious zombies is handled brilliantly. The camera work and editing combine to make a genuinely terrifying and horrifying scene.However when the film settles down the hand held camera work and trademark grainy dark visuals start to irritate, as do the holes in the plot. The London settings, for a film financed in part by the UK film Council are thudding - Tower bridge,The Dome, Wembley, Big Ben.Nice for the Yanks, but a bit too obvious for British audiences.The allegorical content regarding the parallels between the Americans inability to 'hold' central London in the same way as they have failed in Baghdad is fine. You either 'get' the layering, or you don't. Those that don't are not missing out as it does not interfere with the mainline plotting.Pretty consistently dark, gory and unpleasant, there is an hilarious scene towards the end when a helicopter uses its blades to decapitate dozens of attacking zombies causing everyone in the cinema to burst out laughing - intentionally so, and a piece of welcome 'black' relief.The finale neatly opens the way for a third installment in such a way that i am sure it would b successful. Maybe next time eh Danny and Alex?",5,1,3,26 May 2007
21," Enjoyable, slick and intelligent.
","Whilst knowing broadly the story on which this film is based, I hadn't read the book, nor am I a gambling expert. My wife, who watched it with me, has never stepped inside a casino. Despite all this lack of inside knowledge, we were both royally entertained for two hours.The minimum of profanity, the sharpness of the script, and the lavish production values made this an unusually enjoyable tale. I can live with a bit of 'bad guy' violence and the obligatory chase scene as they did add some spice to proceedings.Jim Sturgess is a competent male lead, carrying the part of Ben Campbell well, part geek,part super -smart con man.Kate Bosworth as love interest Jill Taylor convinces as both equally smart, and drop dead gorgeous. The imperious Kevin Spacey dominates each scene in which he is in.The film is not without its flaws, the nerdy comedy duo best friends of Ben are formula writing at its most basic, and several roles (Bens mother and the 'Loss Prevention' Casino Team)are caricatures.Also, the background music at the start is mystifyingly loud and anonymous with no attempt to contemporise the story with a period soundtrack.However, the film is well acted, pacey after an inevitably slow scene setting start, and lavish on the eye with some glamorous Las Vegas sets, and some hedonistic living.Accepting it as a story, rather than a documentary is the key to enjoying this film. Critics seem to focus on what it might have been, pleasure comes from enjoying it for what it is.",7,1,2,20 April 2008
Knowing," Leave Before The End
","The basic ingredients for this film are all here, a fine Big Budget Director (Alex 'I Robot' Proyas), Big Name Leading Man,Nicholas Cage, the guts of a good story, and lots and lots of money. Sadly, it is holed below the waterline with one of the worst endings I have seen in Cinematic History, a view shared by virtually everyone whom I know who has seen this film.The relatively interesting plot also suffers prolonged assault from a very poor script offering trite, clichéd mechanical dialogue.Recovering a 50 year old time capsule from an Elementary School is a promising enough start. Child actor Chandler Canterbury , as Caleb Koestler has a father who is an University Professor schooled in Random and Determinist Theory, who has a friend who is an Astro- Physicist. When Caleb is given a 50 year old list from the time capsule it is not difficult to guess where this story is heading. Disasters are both foretold, and anticipated and their place in them becomes central to the plot.A plane and subway crash,separately, are brilliantly realised in two of the most compelling disaster sequences I have seen, these two items alone score 6/10 for the film. The exact denouement is reasonably concealed, but whenrevealed is preposterous, absurd, risible and excruciatingly realised.Out of nowhere an ET moment occurs so sickly sweet and devoid of credibility and tension that all before it is destroyed. Why Caleb doesn't cry to his Dad ,'This spaceship is really cool, I'm going on board to take a look,' is beyond me. We then have a hugely impressive, and pointless, 'Day After Tomorrow,' sequence as New York is wiped out AGAIN ( this City must have some bad movie karma).The closing frames of children holding hands, on a mythical planet, clutching cuddly rabbits as waving wheat and barley sweep around them in a verdant valley, complete with the Tree of Life is about as ill-advised as it gets.If the studio had halved the budget, a credible ending and script might have emerged. Instead we get lazy, bloated Hollywood at its very worst. I await the DVD release purely to see if there is an alternate ending. Otherwise, enjoy a reasonable enough effort  and leave 20 minutes before the end. You will feel much better for it.",6,1,3,29 March 2009
Salt," Enjoyable Nonsense
","A far- fetched, but action packed, knockabout spy yarn that defies rational analysis but is entertaining enough. Angelina Jolie stars as Salt, the CIA operative who is ostensibly outed by a Russian defector. What follows is an increasingly preposterous series of stunts and plot developments saved by some very good action scenes.Director Phillip Noyce knows his way around the spy/action genre through the Tom Clancy conceived Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger, and also The Saint. The opening scene has a suitably lascivious shot of Salt being tortured in her underwear. Thereafter she dispatches America's and Russia's finest with ease.The Russian stereotypes are lazy, and the sacrifice of realism for action ludicrous. Yet it is all well done, the story zips along going from one set-piece action sequence to the next. Jolie struggles with the script, a small part of it is trying to be a bona fide spy yarn, but for the rest she is Lara Croft, a fantasy indestructible Amazon.Not to be taken too seriously.",7,1,3,22 January 2011
Dreamgirls," A Musical Joy
","A hugely enjoyable screen musical telling the story of the rise of all female, all black singing trio, 'The Dreamgirls'. An affectionate pastiche of the story of the 'Supremes', a stellar cast portrays several characters contemporary to that era. For Berry Gordy see James Foxx, for Diana Ross see Beyonce Knowles, for James Brown see Eddy Murphy and for an Etta James / Florence Ballard/ Aretha Franklin composite see Jennifer Hudson. Director William Condon was shrewdly picked acknowledging his previous success as the writer for screen musical success 'Chicago'.An overwhelmingly black cast tells the story, set in Detroit, in two acts. Pre 1970 as the Dreamgirls struggle to make it, and post 1970, when the pitfalls of stardom bite. Adapted from the musical which was 'sung through', this version is predominantly spoken with the original songs as stand-alone pieces. The songs themselves are superb, penned by Henry Krieger, predominantly with Tom Eyen. They effectively recall the sounds , songs, and themes of the time whilst updating the arrangements to resonate with a more contemporary idea of R&B. And all this is played out against a backdrop of Race Riots and racism.Danny Glover is wonderful as the manager who gets the group noticed only to be out hustled by smooth talking James Foxx as Curtis Taylor Jnr. But it is Jenifer Hudson as Effie White who steals the show. Her raw talent has to defer to the svelte good looks of Beyonce's Deena Jones, and her portrayal of the angst of first losing lead vocal, then her place in the band and her livelihood is compelling.Although the social context of this story is well made, it is the music and performances which dominate. Anyone with a love of the Motown / Philly sounds will love this.",7,0,0,7 February 2010
Dunkirk," Great spectacle- underwritten story
","I am an enthusiastic amateur historian with a particular interest in World War Two. When I heard this film was being made I was both excited, and apprehensive. I was thrilled that one of the great military evacuations of history was coming to the screen, but worried about how the sheer scope of covering an exodus of around a third of a million troops, with the successful ending known, would be tackled.Early reviews praised the spectacle, but criticised the narrative.It is a very good looking film with plenty of panoramic sweeps giving it an epic feel. Director Christopher Nolan has produced a film with an authentic, defiant, heroic , tinge. Understandably, Nolan eschews trying to tell the whole story. There is no Goering, Rundstedt, Hitler, Churchill or Gort. Instead the story is told in three micro stories on the sea, land and air. This has advantages, and disadvantages.There is an intensity and visceral energy to the aerial dogfights, the plight of foot soldiers desperately trying to leave the beaches, only to find themselves torpedoed, and back on the beaches again, and hose manning the flotillas of small boats. However, those stories are vignettes, and not enough time is given to develop an emotional connection with the protagonists. The absence of input from the respective national and military leaders also fails to join the dots of individual heroism and tragedy.Thus the early praise and criticism is both justified. This is a fine looking film, spectacular, and compelling in its presentation. But the narrative, and characterisation, is weak, making it fall short as one of the great war films.",7,3,6,8 September 2017
Control," Unremittingly Bleak Biopic
","As an offering for the converted ,this is a fine piece of work, beautifully filmed by Director, and devotee Anton Corbijn. As a stand alone offering it is fatally flawed.Ian Curtis is not a great artist or singer.Joy Division were not a great band.They did not have a great song list, had one popular hit, and a minor repertoire of cult classics. Nor were they a great live band.As the years have progressed their 'legendary' status has grown, but time has not been kind to them. The films 'raison d'etre', therefore, starts shakily.Despite these reservations the film did have a chance.Pop stars who die young always have a fascination for what 'might have been',and Curtis's story does have the potential for an Everyman tale, but it does not succeed.New Order, the phoenix incarnation of Joy Division were far more successful artistically, critically and popular after Curtis's death.There has been little posthumous positive re evaluation of the Curtis period. It was raw, the ingredients were there for a successful band, and they subsequently made it big. And that is about it.So this is no 'Doors' or 'Thin Lizzy' tale.Instead, it is a bit boring and unremarkable.Sam Riley provides a convincing performance as Curtis, the black and white photography is atmospheric and strangely lush, the contemporary soundtrack and Joy Division music authentic.Yet it is a soul less film. Written by his widow Deborah, we never really understand what is inspiring this tortured being. Sadly, suicidal individuals rarely bare their soul to the world, and I suspect that Deborah simply doesn't know. Inevitably her treatment of Ian's Mistress, Annik, is circumspect.Visually attractive (played by Alexandra Maria Lara)her characterisation is wafer thin, offering little insight into the attraction, or relationship.Joy Division and Curtis mythology centre around the 'tortured young man' image of the lead singer. This is faithfully represented. Yet young men in bands invariably enjoy themselves too, any 'joie de vivre' is notably absent robbing the script of light and shade.In order to emotionally feel the lows, you need to have been lifted a bit as well. Here we start low, and get lower.Corbijn is superb at capturing a verite sense of moment and time.Deborah Curtis offers a convincing sense of narrative.But ultimately the subject material is not strong enough to carry a 117 minute running time for the casual or uninformed observer.As an homage for the die hard fan it will no doubt be essential.For the rest, it proves to be inconsequential.",4,2,5,16 November 2008
Saw III," Tired Third Installment Loses It's Way
","When the first Saw came out it was a revelation. Although low budget, it brimmed full of suspenseful ideas and is a modern day horror classic. Tightly scripted, with just one main set, the claustrophobic horror overwhelmed the viewer. The second Saw lost momentum because of the multiple sets, this one just squeezes the juice out of an already overworked idea.Sadly, the new vogue is torture-flicks as practised by Hostels 1 +2, No Way Out, Vacancy and now this. The bastard progeny of the first Saw.The new scenario for the torture of hapless innocents is pretty unconvincing. once again the claustrophobia of the original is lost, and with it dramatic tension. As a consequence the gore is just that. No real context, you don't really care about the individuals or find their predicament convincing.Hence the only way to ratchet up the 'thrills' is to devise ever more sick torture scenes.The actors don't act, they just perform horror poses. It is desperately disappointing to see this franchise so bankrupt of inspiration. Because lurking in there, there is still another original film to be shot. Ironic isn't it, that the low budget first instalment delivered so much, and the high budget third instalment delivers so little?Give it a miss. For gore junkies and sadists only.",3,0,1,31 July 2007
Tropic Thunder," Big Budget Disaster movie
","Rarely can so much money have been spent to so little effect, or for so few laughs.Like the recently released, 'Step brothers',a funny idea is stretched too thinly over too long a period, and snaps and destroys itself.Awash with in-jokes,visual references to other films and other 'knowing' material which was probably quite funny in the set trailer park after a few beers, the humour does not survive the cold light of day.Stiller, who writes, directs and stars in the film (always dangerous territory) implodes with the self indulgence of it all, and his sister Amy, listed as script supervisor appears to have been absent for the gig.In De Palma's magnificent 'Carlitos Way', Sean Penn plays a part so removed from the norm that it is possible to forget that he was in it, whilst revelling in his character's performance.Here, Tom Cruise is virtually slapped across your face before the final 'reveal'.I smiled a few times, but didn't laugh once, no-one did at the screening i attended.Which is a shame, because the idea of a war film that turns real does have some decent comic and dramatic possibilities. Few are explore though, as the stellar cast of actors amuse themselves by having a good time - amongst themselves.Lees money, a smaller cast, shorter running time and a better script were the solution.Avoid.",1,11,20,16 October 2008
The Usual Suspects," Amongst The Best Ever Gangster Films
","I am not prone to hyperbole.The gangster pic genre has a long, distinguished history. The classic ingredients are often imitate, but rarely improved upon.Then came The Usual Suspects.Singer shoots for the stars in the opening sequence, and hits the target.The sweeping classical music, the incessant rain, the unexplained bodycount, an unfolding picture of catastrophe - all draw the viewer into this compelling and outstanding film.Cliché is bypassed and fine storytelling unfolds.The ensemble cast are brilliant.Giancarlo Esposito is outstanding as Jack Baer, the deadpan FBI agent determined to get his man. The Suspects themselves give bravura character performances each of which colour the question, Who, or what, is Keyser Soze? Where this film scores is that although it is firmly in the Gangster genre, it is narrative and plot driven. The gritty violence is incidental and all the more powerful for it. The Twist is a bodyblow at the end, but this story bears watching again and again for its' quality alone.Reminiscent of Cagney at his finest, Singer combines the inevitability of 'Carlitos Way' with the literacy of 'Heat'. 106 minutes, and every second counts. Unmissable.",10,0,1,18 August 2006
Quantum of Solace," Running on Empty
","As a huge fan of the genre, the series, and Daniel Craig,I approached this instalment hoping for the best - and was bitterly disappointed.Marc Forsters past directorial credentials did not identify him as an obvious Bond custodian,he does not rise to the challenge.Nominally carrying on from 'Casino Royale' the threadbare plot quickly runs out of steam. Its modest 106 minute running time still had me, and others, checking our wrist watches as the stripped down style failed to engage.The 'threat' is a baddie who wants to monopolise water production in Bolivia, and then hike the prices! Have the script writers not heard of Severn Trent? The pre- credit car chase is pretty superfluous and fails to match even Liam Neeson in the 'Taken' chase sequence at the Albanians camp.The set pieces have a curious stand alone quality, the gritty sections lack continuity, conviction and purpose.As a consequence, viewers are left yearning for a bit of glamour, and gadgetry not as nostalgia, but to compensate.perversely the 'Live And Let Die' style finale where the enemy HQ is blown up is totally unnecessary, and cold.Craig is fine again as Bond,Olga Kurylenko is an adequate female lead.But there is no glamour and when M relieves him of his duties it smacks of a desperate attempt to try to spice up a flagging script. A misfire.",3,6,11,1 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," A Pearl Amongst Swine
","Just recently my enthusiasm for contemporary cinema has been waning. Clever, but formulaic scripts, contrived plots, and painting by number incidents. Then something comes along which shakes all that up -and 'No Country For Old Men' does that.The cinematography is lush, the desert settings evocative, and the key characters get a very welcome chance to breathe for once.Its style pays homage to the great westerns, and Tommy Lee Jones as veteran Sheriff, Ed Tom Bell lends an elegiac, 'fin de siecle' feel to proceedings.The violence is graphic and bloody,the script wordy,reflective and wry,but the Coen brothers show a discipline throughout which Tarrantino would do well to note.The gruesome slaughter which pervades this film is shown in a wholly amoral manner. Life and death a matter of chance - won or lost on the toss of a coin, both metaphorically and literally.When required, the set piece action scenes never fail to disappoint. Equally there are spoken stretches where nothing much happens, other than enriching our appreciation of both character and plot, rare indeed.The end is sudden, and requires careful attention to the opening, as well as the closing, monologue - and almost requires a second viewing, which is no bad thing.",8,3,6,23 January 2008
Mamma Mia!," Delightful Light Entertainment
","In recent years the success of TV shows like X Factor, Pop/American Idol and Britain / America's Got Talent have reminded everyone of the simple pleasures of singing, dancing and having a good time. Curiously, the Musical genre, which epitomises this, has been slow to reflect this interest on our cinema screens. However with the success of Hairspray, High School Musical and now Mama Mia, I suspect there will be many more to follow.Mama Mia starts from a strong base. A fine musical catalogue, a successful stage production, the co-operation of songwriters Benny and Bjorn and a well known cast are a good start.But then it pretty much overwhelms the audience with it's sheer 'joie de vivre'. Don't listen to the curmudgeonly doubters, if you want to find fault with this production of course you can. But thats not really the point. This film is for enjoying the music, laughing at the slapstick comedy, having a good time and perhaps even kicking off those heels and having a dance.Meryl Streep successfully dominates this film with all the enthusiasm of an Aunt visiting for Christmas and determined to have a good time. Ably assisted by Julie Walters, and a particularly good Christine Baranski the three of them laugh, dance and cry themselves through a plot which is frankly only there to allow everyone to enjoy themselves.Amanda Seyfried as Streep's daughter is the right mix of innocence and verve and the three prospective 'fathers',Brosnan, Firth and Skarsgard ham up their scenes monstrously.The only real query on the film is Brosnan's singing. It is terrible. I hope that it was left in as a joke because it does cause you to literally laugh out loud. Which is in marked contrast to Streep who sings admirably, giving Madonna a run for her money in the latter's starring role in Evita.The sun of course always shines, the buildings look rustic and welcoming, and the sea is blue.The 'set pieces', Voulez Vous, Dancing Queen and a raucous Does Your Mother Know always entertain, Chiquitita is an unexpected delight! The Fifties and Sixties produced a run of popular musicals making the likes of Diana Dors stars in the process. The Musical is back for the 21st century!",8,7,11,14 July 2008
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Excellent Instalment - with welcome new comic dimension
","This is the fourth in the Mission Impossible series and it reboots the concept, rivalling the first instalment, and is far better than Missions Two and Three. The choice of Brad Bird as Director was risky, inspired, and has paid off. Bird's credits are with TV series, and animation on television and the big screen, but he is best known for his work with the Simpsons. That he handles the action so well is a pleasant surprise, the delight is the humour he brings to the film with Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn being given a full supporting role, and injecting a comic element which freshens the story considerably. In several scenes he steals the glory from Tom Cruise, and this enhanced role will surely be an essential ingredient in the next film. He plays Dunn as a youthful Q in the James Bond series but more dynamically than simply as a techno-geek.Hollywood's desire to penetrate emerging markets is much in evidence here. A substantial chunk of the film is set in Moscow, Russia is not the bad guy (nor is the United States the good guy per se)and there are enough Russian sub-titles to facilitate a Russian language version with English subtitles. Almost as much screen time is devoted to Mumbai too where the film reaches its climax in a shameless attempt to woo Russian and Indian audiences.Particular credit should also be given to the role of women in this film. Paula Patton, as Jane Carter proved playing opposite Denzil Washington in 'Deja Vu' that she was a very accomplished actress. Here she has a wonderful role as kick-ass agent resolved to avenge the death of a colleague and honey trap. She looks absolutely gorgeous in a powder blue shift dress and jacket, but is deadly too when she kicks off her heels to get down to business. Lea Seydoux, fresh from her success in Robin Hood, has an equally satisfying role as Sabine Moreau, an icy cold assassin on the bad guys team.The set pieces are uniformly excellent, the opening break out from a Russian prison is particularly well choreographed and staged. Mid film Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt takes stunts to new heights literally, with a human fly scene at the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai and the film ends with two action sequences in India. The latter, although well played cannot trump the Dubai stunt, but then again there are a lot more people in India to watch the film than Dubai! A justified criticism is that the plot is pure James Bond, the bad guys steal Russian weapons codes to start a nuclear war with America putting America in the frame by setting up Hunt and his team as fall guys. Furthermore Michael Nyqvist's role as chief villain Kurt Hendricks is utilitarian rather than character driven so we don't get a convincing good v evil showdown, but the story itself works satisfyingly enough. Curiously Ving Rhames briefly reprises his role Luther Stickell for a couple of odd minutes at the end which add little to the story, perhaps more was left on the cutting room floor? In summary a faithful, action-packed and buoyant return to form with a very welcome new comedic dimension to it. Cruise's maturity in giving Simon Pegg more space in the story, and a willingness to be prepared to act his age, rather than a screen twenty five, does him much credit. I also applaud the fact that the iconic theme tune remains unchanged and the message , should they choose to accept it, still self-destructs in five seconds. The standard for the next instalment has been set high!",7,3,7,1 January 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Inspired Re-invention of the Series
","I am pretty neutral about the Planet of the Apes series. A nice idea, but not essential viewing. So I approached this instalment with low expectations – and was pleasantly surprised. It re-imagines the start of the story in a contemporary setting, cleverly instantly bringing it up to date. There is also a coherent story to follow to ensure there is no over-reliance on special effects. Combined, it works rather well.The formula (pun intended) is stock sci-fi fare. A scientist, Will Rodman, played by James Franco, discovers a drug which accelerates intelligence in apes, and appears to offer benefits to dementia sufferers of whom his father is one. A disastrous sales pitch results in his drug company abandoning the project, Rodman rescues the baby chimp , Caesar, of its drug treated mother who has inherited her modified genes, tests the treatment on his ailing father with promising early results – then things start to go wrong.Director Rupert Wyatt's only previous mainstream effort was the scarcely noticed ( but soon to be reappraised I am sure )'Escapist'. He keeps the story skipping along using well worn, but effective devices. The baby chimp is cute, a pretty female vet tumbles into his bed very easily to provide some glamour, the Drug Company executive is evil and gets his comeuppance, the ailing, then recovering elderly Rodman senior provides breadth and another dimension, to the story as well as a strong emotional pull. And there is the cruel animal sanctuary attendant and a scene which echoes very closely one in The Elephant Man.Excellent use is made of location, particularly the Redwood forests and the Golden Gate bridge on which the final showdown is staged. The combination of human actors and cgi to animate the apes is convincing and effective with Caesar acting as much as the human characters. Special mention should also be made of the music which captures the mood perfectly echoing the score for the original King Kong.There are some compromises for the 12A certificate. The original film made famous by Charlton Heston explored some Fascist and Totalitarian themes, largely ignored this time around. The frontier spirit of freedom embodied by the Redwood forests is hinted at, but left. Equally, explicit violence is kept to a minimum with the apes making some fairly arbitrary displays of restraint upon gaining their freedom. The animal sanctuary itself seems pretty generously proportioned, and well populated for a State facility (how many apes need to be re-housed in San Fransisco?), but also makes for a fine location for some significant scenes. As a consequence the film is visceral enough to entertain teenagers, toned down enough to enthral older children, and sufficiently well made to engage adults, which is why it has done so well at the box office.At just over 100 minutes the story does not outstay its welcome and the ( guaranteed) sequel is solidly prepared for in a way which does not make what the viewer has seen feel like just half a film. Enjoyable and entertaining this is a worthy addition to the Sci-fi genre.",Null,0,1,15 August 2011
City of God," Visceral Brilliance
","A wonderful film that succeeds in paying homage to the American gangster film genre whilst at the same time creating a distinct world all of its own.An unknown cast is brilliantly Directed by Fernando Meirelles to offer a stunning insight into the world of the slums in Brazil, and in particular The City of God.Although telling the story over the decades of a group of slum children, and concentrating on one who made good, and another who made very bad,an Everyman story also emerges of poverty, survival and quick wits.The stunning Cinematography contrasts sharply with the grimy tale that unfolds told almost exclusively through the eyes of the young protagonists.A body count unfolds which would make Tarantino blush, and we quickly become desensitised to the casual deaths, often of children.Yet a richness of spirit emerges which , helped by some gallows humour, keeps the story bounding along at a brisk pace.few films justify a 130 minute running time, this does.Told in episodic fashion each section is produced in a highly disciplined manner.With little in the way of special effects the narrative has to triumph, and it does.A particularly noticeable feature is that unlike in Hollywood, when rounds are fired, people are shot, and stay shot.A foreign language tour de force.",8,0,1,3 April 2009
2012," Retro Disaster Kitsch
","With Director Roland Emerich you know what you are going to get. Explosions, tidal waves, crashing buildings and catastrophe are his lingua franca. He delivers. Yet as many have pointed out, this is a deeply frustrating film. The storyline is fine, and ambitious, and there is a budget to match. The actors are solid, and the ample two and a half hour running time is more than enough to get the story told, so why the carping? In short, the story is not told well enough.The trailers allude to Mayan prophesy of the destruction of the world in 2012, yet in the film it only just gets a mention. There is no sense of ancient foretold doom. When the world starts to 'turn hot' the global meetings are little more than an excuse to provide location shots to sell the film in different countries, and a sub plot involving the state execution of whistle-blowers poised to reveal all to an unsuspecting public appears, then disappears, to little purpose.John Cussack is a convincing hero, Danny Glover is hopelessly miscast as the American President in a horribly written role and Thandie Newton is wasted as an incidental love interest for co- hero, Chiwetel Ejiofor. Woody Harleston has a bizarre cameo as a hippy dj who knows what is going on and has the secret map that reveals all, and appears to be the sort of person to keep the kids well away from.The action scenes themselves are tremendous, but there appears to be little holding it all together. Clunkily episodic, each scene seems riddled with cliché and seems to demand it's own disaster sequence. The characters get insufficient time to win us over and the human interest ephemera like the hero's daughter 's bed wetting are grindingly forced. Worst of all the biggest Disaster Movie Cliché of all – that the dog always survives, is alive and well.The climax of the film is grotesquely drawn out as man-made arks are launched to save civilisation. Incredibly this causes Emerich to then go into 'Poseidon Adventure' mode, in an exercise of wholly unnecessary self indulgence. Inside all of this there is a decent film waiting to get out. The discipline, a word which Emerich does not know the meaning of, of delivering a 90 to 105 minute picture would have produced a much more satisfying, and impactful result.The end result is closest to 1950's style world disaster / Alien movies, but without the charm.",4,3,4,11 April 2010
The Mist," Above Average Horror Fare
","Stephen king now bestrides the horror genre as a colossus and this cinematic interpretation of his novel is a fine one. Although all the thematic devices are obviously there, the screenplay by Frank Darabont provides a pleasing intelligence adding a further credit to his prior successes with the Green Mile and the Shawshank Redemption.The formula is well concocted. The unexplained mist that descends on a backwater town comes with the same menace as John Carpenters 'The Fog'. A supermarket provides both a refuge, and a prison for those engulfed, echoing Carpenters 'Assault on Precinct 13', whilst the crazed antics of the assailants and their victims are reminiscent of Romero's work.Thomas Jane is a convincing lead as hero David Drayton with Laurie Holden offering the glamour and a mother figure for Drayton's young son who is also trapped.The stand out performance however is by supporting actress by Marcia Harden as Mrs Carmody playing a fundamentalist Christian convinced that Armageddon is upon them and whipping up a 'Witches of Salem' hysteria.The CGI is largely convincing, the suspense well created, and the gore sufficient for aficionados of the genre whilst not being used as an easy substitute for dramatic tension.The only let down is the ending. just before it I reflected that a certain ending wold be both childishly amusing, and preposterous - and then it happened!Nonetheless the previous 125 minutes more than compensate for this.

I Am Legend," Disappointing, Soul less, Remake
","Sometimes a good story, a big budget, and a hot leading actor is not enough, as this retread of 'The Omega Man ' demonstrates.As a straight story, it is OK. But the good bits are lifted from the original, and the 21st Century reinterpretations are flat.The title itself is pretentious, bordering on the preposterous, and the rest of the picture largely follows suit.Largely played as a single hander, Will Smith plays the part of Dr Robert Neville convincingly enough. The fact that his dog Doesn't survive is a nice twist on accepted disaster movie convention.His pre occupation with Bob Marleys redemptive aspirations are a pale echo of the Woodstock film at the start of the 'Omega Man'.In the original the mutants have a role, and a leader, and are far more powerful for it. This time round they are lifted straight out of Lord of the Rings / The descent/ The Cave, and whilst offering shock value deny the script dramatic tension. In 1971, you could forgive the formulaic and one dimensional part written for the female companion he comes across, in 2008 it is unforgivable, and part of a headlong rush in the last quarter to wrap things up as quickly 9and unconvincingly) as possible.Neville's flashbacks add little to the story and could easily have been sacrificed in favour of more body for both the mutants, and the girl.Francis lawrence, director, has a background in TV and video, it shows, and ultimately he is out of his depth with this effort.",4,1,3,12 January 2008
Gran Torino," Eastwood, actor and director, on superb form
","A superb piece of cinema which sees Eastwood scale new heights as both Director, and Actor. I have never given a film a maximum rating before, as the very essence of art is striving for that little bit more. But not to do so for a work that so conspicuously accomplishes its lofty objectives would be churlish indeed.The story is simple enough, just widowed Walter Kowalski, a Korean War veteran is becoming increasingly isolated. His wife has died, the world is changing all around him, and his neighbourhood is dominated by South East Asians, some of whom have moved in next door. Yet mistrust gives way to acceptance which turns to friendship as Walter fights one last battle with those that threaten his sense of values.It is hard to watch Walter Kowalski without seeing virtually every character that Eastwood has ever played, and in part, he is a distillation of them all. Sometimes he doesn't talk at all, just emitting a Bear like growl, of anger? Of pain? Or maybe both. In part this is an elegiac, valedictory paean to the American Dream, embodied by his eponymous 'Gran Torino'. The American motor car holds an iconic place in U.S. popular culture as lauded by the Beach Boys, Bruce Springsteen and Jack Kerouac, so when next door neighbour Tao is forced to try to steal it as part of a Gang Initiation, this is more than an attempted car theft. This is an assault on the very essence of what ex-Ford car worker Walter holds dear.Yet it draws him into a culture which whilst ostensibly alien, he comes to realise holds dear values which he has considered lost. Family duty and service are paramount. Whilst his own son sells Japanese cars, his grand daughter has her own eyes on the Gran Torino, and the family are circling the Estate like vultures. The irony that the Polish immigrant antecedents of a name like Kowalski are testament to a previous generation's assimilation and adaptation of the American dream resonates throughout.Pushing 80 years old now, actor Eastwood wisely eschews an overtly 'hard man' role, yet in that icy stare lies not only the fictional quintessentially American blue collar views of veteran and production line worker, but also the ghosts of Dirty Harry and a plethora of Western vengeance seekers, and wreakers. The violence, such as it is, is understated. The depiction of the Mong gangs, restrained. Ever since the stylised teenage gang violence of West Side Story morphed into the gratuitous excesses of 'Death Wish', American cinema has glamorised and celebrated this phenomena in shameless supplication to a teenage audience. Not here it isn't.Director Eastwood has produced his finest hour here. Not a single frame is wasted. The American flag flutters behind him as he sits on his porch, dog by his side, early in the film viewing the wholly alien customs and language of his next door neighbours. The dialogue is similarly efficient. Elegaic, without being sentimental, Eastwood's trademark wry humour is also evident as he tries to introduce 'man talk' to Tao, in his Italian hairdressers, and in his ongoing duels with a Priest a third of his age, keen to speak to him about matters ' life and death'.There is an excellent supporting cast, lead by Ahney Her, as Sue who provides a linguistic and dramatic bridge between Kowalski and the surrounding community. If this is Eastwood's swansong as a leading role actor it is a fitting one. However I do hope that his Directorial ambitions remain. As an actor popular acclaim superseded critical acclaim resulting in his fairly late entry into the Directors chair. On this form he still has much more to give.",10,1,6,6 March 2009
The Hurt Locker," Hollow Action
","I approached this film with great excitement and expectation but walked away deflated, and disappointed. Which is not to say that it is without merit. The action scenes are superb, the tension often on a hair trigger. But there is a curious lack of cohesion about it all which lets it down.The set pieces are well crafted, what lies between is not. Jeremy Renner does well as hero defuser Sgt James. Perhaps too well. His egocentric character alienates those around him on screen, and the audience alike leaving little to warm to. A desert shoot out sequence involving English contractors is fine action, but appears to have been spliced in at random. A bomb disposal tale depends for its success upon the audience rooting for the heroes, and there is little to root for. The excessive use of non-static camera work I found irritating, and distracting, often the sign that a Director has chosen to jazz up the realism by making the perspective wobble a bit. It doesn't, it is just tiresome.It took America a long time to get to grips with Vietnam at the cinema, but this is no Deer Hunter / Platoon/ Apocalypse Now or Hamburger Hill. In moving away from banal self- justification for the war in Iraq, it is a step in the right direction, but no more.Director Katherine Bigelow's last feature, the excellent k-19 Widowmaker scored on narrative and characterisation, both big minuses here. This assessment swims in the face of popular sentiment on release i know. But this is how i see it.",3,34,61,28 August 2009
Ex Machina," Thoughtful and meticulously constructed
","What a delight to see a thoughtful, meticulously constructed sci-fi film that does not rely on special effects and explosions for its success.Set amidst a visceral wilderness, the cerebral Nathan (Oscar Isaac), CEO of a high the company, has built a remote laboratory to explore AI. Employee Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) wins the opportunity to test it. What unfolds is an exploration of what makes us human.Some may find the pace slow, others will relish that writer and director Alex Garland uses every shot and every second to communicate and build his message.Nathan's persona is in counterpoint to his position, his technological brilliance harnessed to an obsession with sex, bodies, and hedonism. The cinematography is lush, the vast brooding open wilderness in brutal juxtaposition with the claustrophobic, sealed laboratory where the action takes place.The dialogue is sharp, the plotting always one step in front of the obvious. But Garland does not pitch this as a didactic tale on the perils of AI, it is not a seminar, more like a friend inviting you round for a beer and asking 'what if?'",8,1,3,21 August 2015
Casualties of War," A Very Fine Film
","In the same way that time had to move on in order that considered films on the Vietnam War could be made, so time sometimes needs to move on to provide a perspective on those films themselves.In the early 21st century America finds itself in another hopeless adventure abroad, in Iraq, with young men killing and being killed with no-one quite sure why.With the passage of time this story assumes a depth and resonance that wasn't possible at the time.De Palma's strength is in how he portrays people, and this is a veritable tour de force in this respect.Sean Penn is about the finest actor of his generation, and his Sgt Meserve is superb.Brutal and loyal, yet cruel and amoral. Just what the Army needs in a battle, but not the sort of person that the Capitol Hill aesthetes would welcome for dinner.Michael J Fox carries the part of the effete whistle blower well, his hair is always as nicely washed and clean as his morals, yet in the crucial court martial scene, it is hard to work up any enthusiasm for his actions.Cleverly, De Palma runs two parallel belief sets here. On the one hand, kidnapping, raping and murdering farm girls is not right. Equally when you train young men to kill, and risk their lives day on day, when they see their friends killed and mutilated, when all vestiges of their home life are stripped away in an alien jungle, nobody should be too surprised that some will get up to no good.Ultimately this is the triumph of the film. The casualties are literally everywhere.I felt as much for the convicted soldiers as I did for their victim.The chaos of the battle scenes where all you have is your buddies is well played. The loyalty, bravery, Stoicism and heroism of the doomed patrol are shown as vividly as the amorality of their actions.A worthy synthesis of excellent battle set pieces and cerebral soul searching.",8,1,2,21 March 2008
Mulholland Drive," A Masterpiece
","This film's birth pangs as a failed TV pilot make the end result even more remarkable. Over a year later, Director David Lynch picks up the pieces (literally), shoots new scenes and then produces not only his finest film to date but one of the all - time greats of modern cinema.Detailed analysis, and a fine double disc DVD set with abundant interviews, can be found elsewhere.But for the uninitiated, the story opens with a beautiful woman who staggers away from a car wreck with memory loss and the tale of how her subsequent fortunes intertwine with those of the young woman whose temporary home she stumbles across.Twin female leads,Naomi Watts and Laura Harring offer tour de force performances as beautiful, mysterious, sexy and dangerous women seemingly skitting between reality and a strange, ethereal world which we cannot quite place.Nothing is quite what it seems, clues and false trails abound, ad the viewer is kept guessing till the end, and beyond.A majestic music score,and stunning, lush, beautiful cinematography combines with a literate script and obtuse plot to create atmosphere, excitement and uncertainty.The girl's make-up and dress is invariably immaculate strenghtening the ambiguity of the story line.The irony that a film so removed from Hollywood convention should be set in Hollywood is sweet indeed.A masterpiece which will be appreciated by film students and aficionados for years to come.",10,3,4,11 October 2009
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," A Minor Gem
","Director and writer Mark Herman already has very fine writing credentials,arguably his best work to date being 'Brassed Off', set amidst the Miners strike. Herman's humanity shines through again in this compelling tale of a concentration camp seen through a child's eyes.The power of this work lies in the fact that it is told, and shot, as a children's film, yet the story covers the darkest period in modern Western History. The central figure is eight year old Bruno, son of the Camp Commandant.He builds up an innocent youthful friendship with child internee Shmuel against a dark backdrop of implied and overt maltreatment of the other Jews.This light, simplistic tale on the one hand is as lightly told as 'The Sound of Music' but comes with a twist as dark and profound as you could wish for.I found the plummy English accents grating set in an all German environment. Yet sub-titles would have massively reduced the film's marketability and cod - German accents could have been just as irritating.Vera Farmiga delivers a marvellously nuanced performance as Bruno's mother,and David Hayman's Pavel, the Jewish Servant is achingly tragic. This film is a wonderful introduction to any child to the grim reality of this part of human history.At times it teeters close to being too twee, pandering to the kids audience on one hand, then doesn't quite swing the hammer blows that the story deserves, yet still triumphs through understatement.A classic that will be shown for years to come.",7,1,1,11 October 2009
Saw II," Volume Two Does Not Disappoint
","Like many others I was riveted by the original Saw from start to finish.The hallmarks of gore, sadism, horror, innovation and tight storytelling are back with a vengeance, although the physical setting lacks some credibility, this is more than compensated for by another ripping yarn.It is difficult to believe that the Director, Darren Bousman, is only 27 years old. My only concern is that he should have the courage to walk away after the forthcoming Saw 3 to develop his talents outside of this stunning formula, and not become bogged down by it.There are not many films which have me closing my eyes and recoiling in revulsion whilst still being compelled to watch. This is such a film. Like Final Destination on heavy drugs Bousman finds ever more ingenious ways to kill and maim people, whilst just teetering on the right side of entertainment The denouement cleverly leaves the door ajar for Saw 3, I cannot wait!",7,1,2,5 August 2006
Jurassic World," A decent effort- but the franchise is moribund
","The fourth in the 'Jurassic' series, this film has divided opinion. It is easy to understand why.As an addition to the series it is derivative, clichéd, lazy and half baked. As a stand- alone action film it is rather good.The problem with the series is that the original brought together great writing with Michael Crichton, a great idea, ground breaking special effects, and Spielberg. That is a potent combination.Four down the line, there is no Michael Crichton, no original idea, great special effects and no Spielberg. The wonder has gone.Which if you are checking out the series for the first time, is fine. Bryce Dallas Howard is hot, Chris Pratt is handsome, and there are lots of dinosaur moments eating each others, and humans. Yet once you have seen the dinosaurs doing their thing, and the genetically modified super dinosaur doing his/her thing, the tension drops, and on an island, there are only so many people you can eat. The jeopardy isn't really there. A risible sub plot of a team developing raptors for military purposes is, risible. The breathy claim that they could have worked wonders in Tora Bora is just stupid.The original was a great film, this is just good entertainment. There is nothing wrong with that.",5,3,8,2 November 2015
The Dark Knight," A Superhero Tour De Force
","Over history, literature has constantly reassessed and reshaped heroes and villains. Batman is a relatively contemporary creation, born of the much derided Cartoon Book genre, yet in this film, Director Christopher Nolan creates a gravitas and purpose only hinted at in those early drawings, building on the success of 'Batman Begins'. Aided by a top cast, this film reaches past the obvious niche audiences and finds a resonance far beyond.Heath Ledger gives a role defining performance as the Joker. He exudes, paranoia, psychosis and cruelty with humour almost an afterthought. Given Ledger's alleged battles with depression it is unnerving to witness so convincing a display of an unhinged mind, but utterly compelling. The British 12A Certification is tested to the limit by the sadistic use of knives, totally in context, but hardly easily dismissed as 'Comic book violence'.Christian Bale is a convincing Batman, playing the action sequences with an aggressive, vicious detachment, yet perfectly at home as the anonymous Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman revel in their character roles as Alfred the Butler, and Head of R&D Lucius Fox , respectively. Both deliver understated, but perfectly observed performances.Never short of outrageous action sequences, explosions and ensemble set pieces, what lifts this picture is its preparedness to seriously consider the role of the hero, villain, good and evil, chaos, and the impotence, but decency, of the ordinary citizen. When two hordes of hostages fail to meet the Jokers fiendish plan he rails that 'You cant rely on anyone these days 'and' if you want a job doing you have to do it yourself'. Equally he hints that there is evil out there purely for evil's sake  a chilling touchstone for the curse of modern mass terrorism.The Cinematography is consistently beautiful and the production values a fine mix of the real and CGI. With actors Gary Oldman and Colin MacFarlane also making valuable contributions, it is curious how such a strong British contingent have redrawn an all-American hero. Perhaps it is because Nolan displays such consummate skill in examining themes, and attitudes which transcend time and place, and as such is an outrageous bedfellow with the Coen Bothers 'No Country For Old Men'.",9,3,8,30 July 2008
Into the Wild," A Beautiful, Thought Proving Work
","Director Sean Penn will have been delighted by the controversy and debate this film has created. Yet its flaws are also its strengths.There are many unanswered questions- about central figure Chris McCandless's reckless behaviour in Alaska and his handling of his relationship with his sister and family in particular.These criticisms miss the point.Penn has created an episodic exploration of 'untamed' America which need only be taken at face value. What remains are images of a great wilderness and vignettes of life's highs, a brief chance meeting with a Danish couple in the Grand Canyon, and it's lows, a beating by railway security.It encapsulates the loose Everyman desire to commune with the wild,discover the beauty and truth of nature, and eschew life's materialistic trappings.No individual could possibly satisfactorily represent all those emotions, and McCandless, wonderfully played by Emile Hirsch, doesn't.Ultimately, it is a doomed quest. A tragedy that seeks, and attempts to illuminate, some truths about human existence. The extent to which it succeeds is down to the viewer, not the Director.Sometimes the pace is so slow that proceedings come to a graceful halt.Yet these halts serve merely as a coda, for the next meting with a stranger, and for the next sunset.For those bored with formulaic blockbuster fare this is a welcome diversion, for others this will be a frustratingly slow and long exercise in achieving very little.You decide.",7,1,3,12 January 2009
Blood Diamond," Bold Action Movie With A Conscience
","After Director Zwicks impressive 'Last Samurai' this is an impressive attempt at interweaving a modern action film with difficult contemporary modern issues. De Caprio, taking the lead, comes of age in an all action, but thoughtful performance. Beautifully filmed, and eschewing the gratuitous African 'Lion and Elephant' shots, the focus instead falls on the bloody civil war in Sierra Leone.Although tales of the butchery have a wide currency, the chilling moments when victims are offered the alternative of 'short sleeve' or 'long sleeve ' amputation of limbs is gut wrenching. The chaos and mindlessness of the indigenous violence is skilfully juxtaposed with the amoral actions, and inactions, of the diamond trade. As a snapshot of the brutality of the Civil War, and the complicity, of the Diamond Trade this is a searing success.Slightly less successful are the scenes of the mercenary forces.From 'cinema verite' we career into 'Rambo' territory. And although enjoyable in its own right the Big Action shoot em up sequences are not as effective as the smaller scale action scenes.Hollywood does rear its ugly head at the end. The tale is powerfully told and graphically illustrated. Point made. The finale depicting a conference condemning the Diamond Trade and espousing the merits of 'conflict free' diamonds is quite frankly an insult to the intelligence of the viewer, and reprises the quite dreadful 'concentration camp motorcade' addendum to 'Schindlers List'.Nonetheless this film wins a lot more often than it loses, and neatly interweaves a conventional action movie with a modern morality tale. it scores above average in both genres.",7,1,2,30 January 2007
Taken," Exciting, Overblown Action
","This film has much going for it. Liam Neeson is a credible leading man as Bryan, the retired Special Forces Agent who is trying to rebuild his relationship with his daughter Kim, after his wife remarried.The action is exciting, relentless,and well-staged.Largely set in Paris, the locations are a welcome change from standard Hollywood fare and are well handled by Director Morel, and Writer Besson, both native Frenchmen.The big budget gives plenty of bangs for your buck -or Euro, and the 90 odd minute running time flys by with a convincing story steeped in the 'revenge' genre so often played out in Westerns.But there is also much wrong with it, which, considering the acting talent and budget, could have been put right.The language issue is horribly fudged.Sometimes French and Albanian is sub titled, sometimes it is not. Sometimes French characters speak in English, sometimes they do not. Most comic is a scene in which Neeson impersonates a French Police Officer to Albanians, in broad American English!This unwillingness to immerse in the French culture creates other problems.Bryan has apparent close connections with the French Authorities which helps him through the plot no end, but it seriously detracts from the 'stranger in a strange land' dynamic which helps a tale like this.Equally, the girls, once 'taken' hardly appear again. I would gladly have lost the unnecessary 4x4 chase, shoot-out and explosions at the Albanians camp for a view of 'the other side'.Equally, the shoot outs both at the 'Auction' Hotel and the Sheikhs boat are preposterous and needlessly over the top, the story would have been more effective for a bit of restraint, not less.Finally, the racial stereotyping is lazy.The Americans are good and wholesome, the French corrupt, Albanians, swarthy and evil, Arab Sheikhs, fat with exotic sexual demands. Although mainly set in Paris, rarely is there a french ambiance to proceedings or sense of 'place', in sharp contrast to the recently released 'In Bruges'. No reference at all is made to the fate that befalls his daughters travelling companion.So, an exciting enough film, enjoyable enough in its own right which should have been a lot better.",7,13,27,8 October 2008
Avatar," A Stunning Visual Extravaganza
","Much has been made of Hollywood's investment in 3D, and in 'Avatar', 21st Century 3D technology has come of age.Director James Cameron has realised another world in a largely computer generated set which will take your breath away.Without doubt this is a landmark film in the technological advancement of film. Watching it in anything less than the largest cinema screen you can find in 3D will not do justice to this magnificent production.The story itself, by contrast, is much more routine. Pocahontas meets Independence Day.The heavy 'green' sub-text is a little over bearing, and the characters one dimensional in jarring juxtaposition to their setting.The world, on planet Pandora, is reminiscent of 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth' and 'Jurassic Park' with prehistoric inspired creatures adding danger and colour to the forests.The bad guys in a far flung part of the universe want to plunder rich mining deposits which are inconveniently located where a hunter / gatherer Tribe exist in perfect harmony with their surroundings.As the bad guys muscle in for the booty the indigenous Tribe fight back, guess who wins? The modern tendency of big budget films to unfold in a computer game friendly way is very evident as was the case with 'District 9' and 'Batman Begins'.Indeed,the climatic showdown feels as though it is shot as a computer game set.Yet the sheer scale and excitement of the action makes this a minor irritation.The 2hour 40 minute running time is a little bloated with the first 40 minutes the culprit, as the scene setting is laboriously presented.But as soon as the action transfers to the Rain Forest, the pace picks up, never to falter. And it is in the Forest that the 3D effects stagger the viewer, giant birds swoop, vegetation has an incredible depth, and the battle sequences dwarf anything that we have ever seen in the cinema before for imagination and scale.An instant classic, set to have an impact for many years to come.",9,1,3,25 December 2009
Limitless," Great idea, dreadful execution
","This is one of the most frustrating films I have seen in a long time. The premise is of the invention of a drug , NZT,which maximises the brain's potential offering huge creative and financial advantage to those that take it. However an awful screen play by Leslie Dixon is crippled by the straight jacket of Hollywood's formulaic demands which the Director, Neil Burger, is unable to resist.Lead actor, Bradley Cooper as Eddie Mora, tries his best with a script which engages and intrigues with its concept at the start, then becomes lost in a series of unbelievable plot twists. His rise to fame and fortune, and the price he pays for it, is reminiscent of stories about those gifted with extraordinary wealth or opportunity. But each page of plot development creaks. The impecunious out of work writer is dumped by his girlfriend, but soon he will be able to have any girl he wants, so that is OK. Money doesn't buy him happiness? Really? But it does buy you a better class of misery.Robert de Niro appears unsatisfactorily as a ruthless business mogul in a crude , underwritten role, simply to add some muscle to the cast. The story loses interest in the sci-fi dimension quite quickly to become a thriller, then a crime caper, and finishes with an awful bolted on feel-good schmaltzy ending. The idea is a 9/10, the execution a 3/10, saved by some good special effects and solid production values.",4,1,1,29 July 2013
The Descent," Tight, Sharp. Yarn
","This film has polarised opinion quite sharply, and has inevitably been compared and contrasted with 'The Cave', released at a similar time and with broadly similar themes. For me Neil Marshall has created an above average tale, which, whilst paying homage to the genre steers away from cliché.The pretty much all female cast toys with the viewers stereo types. A girly, simpering whimpering band they are not. Dramatic tension between the characters is well developed ,and heroic deeds are just that, without the 'macho' bravado that can bloat a Stallone style performance.Stylistically, those familiar with 'Dog Soldiers' will not be disappointed or surprised. The 'b list' cast pull together in true egalitarian style to play their parts without trying to steal the show - sometimes less is more, and understated horror is often the best.The transition from 'cavers lost in a cave' to 'cavers terrorised by strange things' is a bit 'clunky'. But it is a tribute to the film that it would have worked as a straight caving accident drama.At 99 minutes it just stays within its welcome - and has run its course. Non fans of the genre will not be converted. But fans will find this a welcome addition.",7,0,1,13 March 2007
Inside Man," Worst Jodie Foster film I've Seen
","I watched this film as a Foster 'completist' and was hugely disappointed, not by Foster per se, but by this clunking effort. The premise of the film - a bank heist that goes wrong with more to it than meets the eye - was promising. The execution was woeful.Denzel Washington is the lead character playing a flawed cop who is pressed into dealing with a heist, and the hostage consequence. Initially, I thought that Washington was simply playing an incompetent cop well. Then it dawned on me that there were some more fundamental incompetence issues.The musical score appears to have come from another film, it is so unsympathetically matched. Foster's appearance is at best a character part, at worst a cameo, and her role is a simplistic plotting device.The plot stretches suspension of disbelief to such absurd levels that as a viewer you feel stupid at the end for giving the Director the benefit of the doubt. A banal script gives the high quality roster of actors precious little room for manoeuvre and the direction is painfully slow.Frustratingly, the storyline has good dramatic potential. But this is squandered in spectacular style as the film limps through its two and a bit hours running time. This is the first Spike Lee film I have ever seen. I shall be consciously avoiding his previous efforts.I note that other posters have been much more positive and enthusiastic about this movie. It is rare that I am able to take such a diametrically opposed view with such confidence.",3,1,4,27 January 2007
The Happening," Don't Believe the (adverse) hype
","The critical kicking that this picture received upon release was such that I almost gave it a 'swerve'. I am glad that I didn't.If you want the bad news read pretty much every other review,if you want the good news read on.The premise of this film, a natural 'event' that causes humans to kill themselves is compelling and intriguing.A 91 minute running time makes for a pacey, if inevitably compressed storyline, which hooks the viewer from start to finish.The combination of an 'unseen killer', the natural 'Rush and rustle of leaves and branches' and the human carnage that results is genuinely spooky.Lead actor Mark Wahlberg guides us perfectly competently through the story with Betty Buckley playing a genuinely disturbing cameo as hermit Mrs Jones.The plot does require 'suspension of disbelief' in several respects, but hey this is a story not a history.Not a classic, but a good yarn nonetheless let down by an absurd, frustrating, corny, commercial 'ending' which had me howling in disapproval.",7,2,7,22 June 2008
30 Days of Night," Gripping,Quirky and Fun.
","I am not a particular fan of Vampire movies, nor of graphic novels generally, let alone the one upon which this was apparently based.My high rating does not acknowledge a cinematic masterpiece, but a genre piece well made, well told.Much has been made about so called 'factual' errors and plot 'holes' 'which totally miss the point.You are invited to suspend disbelief. If you, do you will have a ball, if you don't it is a nonsense.Josh Hartnett, as Sheriff Eban Oleson, is the fulcrum of the tale and does a fine job carrying the film for a full 113 minutes, about twenty minutes longer than a film like this normally demands.Although generously strewn with verbal and situational clichés the stylish presentation and pacey editing keeps things moving.The vampires themselves owe more to the Zombies genre, than the Vampire one.Their sub titled incomprehensible language adding to a sense of mystery and menace.Producer Sam Raimi's hand looms large here. The core of the story plays on our fears of what happens when it gets dark, and we are all alone and our mind starts to run away with primitive fears, which is why it works so well. it is an Everyman story well delivered.I suspect that hardcore 'Vampiristas' may be disappointed by this film which occupies a large chunk of the conventional horror/ Zombie/ slasher genres, which is of course what makes it successful. For there is enough for fans of all of these to thoroughly enjoy.",8,1,3,8 June 2008
The Last King of Scotland," Bold, Compelling Historical Drama
","Historical dramas in Africa are thin on the ground. Although awash with rich material,the sceptre of Rasicm has largely kept mainstream film makers away from Political drama on this volatile continent. Yet McDonalds's tale is a triumph, with a towering performance from Forrest Whitaker as Idi Amin.Ironically the narrative is driven not by Amin , but by James McCavoy as a young Scottish Doctor in search of adventure - who certainly finds it! He uncannily reprises Ewan McGreggors 'Joie de vivre as a Scotsman' and his role allows Amin's to 'breathe'.The cinematography has a wonderful lush African feel to it whilst bravely eschewing the obvious 'safari' shots.Very few films simply show Africans as Africans - and this is one of this film's great strengths. Well edited, and sprightly in pace, one episode zips into another making mincemeat of the two hour running time.The beautiful Gillian Anderson has an understated love interest role at the start of the film as the undervalued wife of a Doctor manning a remote village medical centre. But the real action starts when Amin persuades the young Doctor to join him in Kampala.Ironically the only stereotyping is of the British (English as far as McDonald is concerned) Consular officials as bumbling Colonial mealy -mouthed fools. It smacks of a joke for the Directors Scottish mates, and slightly undermines the restraint with which the other characters are drawn.Apart from the savage climax as the Entebbe Hostage Crisis unfolds, the violence engulfing the country is only alluded to and hinted at. Amin is portrayed largely as a human, colourful, and humorous individual - not least when he is discussing extra marital liaisons with the young Doctor.Although this is a fiction within an historical context it succeeds in both entertaining a s a story and illuminating pretty fairly one of Africa's more notorious dictators",8,3,4,26 January 2007
American Gangster," Good but not Great
","By any measure this is a fine film and certainly one of Ridley Scott's best. One of his great strengths, is his ability to create a sense of 'place', and 60s/70s New York is faithfully, and affectionately, re-created. Clever use of archive news footage of the Vietnam war is interwoven into the story line in seamless style.Denzel Washington, as Gangster Frank lucas, and Russell Crowe as Cop Ritchie Roberts, play an accomplished double hander which aspires to, but doesn't quite match or surpass, De Niro and Pacino in 'Heat'.The 'French Connection' is overtly name checked, and visually alluded to as it competes with esteemed company such as 'Goodfellas'and 'Serpico' as well as the aforementioned in this well stocked genre.Washington gives arguably his finest performance as an understated black gangster (I didn't realise that was possible!)who makes good selling heroin whilst supporting his brothers, cousins, mother and other members of his extended family.Ritchie Roberts by contrast is portrayed as having a dysfunctional home life.For once the wealth of drug trafficking is not shown without cost.The human carnage is painfully depicted - a million miles away from 'heroin chic'. The running time of almost 2 3/4 hours is fully justified as the carefully constructed plot comes to its climax.So why does it fall short? Well really only by the standards of the competition. The dramatic intensity of the personal duel between De Niro and Pacino in 'Heat' is missing, but only because Lucas character is super cool. And the Shakespearean sense of tragedy and impending doom so magnificently evoked by De Palma in 'Carlitos Way' is similarly absent.Based on a true story the denouement where Lucas plea bargains to take down the bent cops is a bit of a plot turn when Roberts avowed intent was to get the big guys - and the Vietnam Military traffickers just disappear off the horizon.Frustrating and unsatisfactory.Nonetheless a worthy movie that I suspect will stand the test of time.",6,5,8,21 November 2007
The Reader," A Literate, Powerful Joy
","A tremendous two hour journey, skilfully produced by the late Anthony Minghella and wonderfully acted by the two central characters, Michael Berg and Hannah Schmidt, played by Ralph Fiennes and Kate Winslet. Fiennes excels as the law student who enjoys a youthful summer romance with a bus conductress, Winslet, who subsequently is revealed as an Extermination Camp SS Guard. A compelling, moving, story is told around subject matter littered with moral bear-traps. Director David Daldrey, whose finest hour to date has been 'Billy Elliot' handles the subject matter with calm authority, the screen play by David Hare, whose natural home is play writing, produces dialogue of conviction and weight, without sounding worthy or self important.Although two hours long the plot is simple, Berg's idyllic summer romance with Schmidt ends suddenly, and he next sees her on trial for Nazi War Crimes. The temptation to explore what makes ordinary people do bad things is resisted. Instead we have a simpler tale, of a repressed, illiterate woman, doing her best to survive herself during the war who finds herself at the furnace of evil. Her actions are neither justified, apologised for or fully explained. You make a judgement 'as you see fit', the advice offered to berg when he takes Schmidt's financial legacy to a Holocaust survivors daughter.The visceral power of the early sexual relationship is powerfully portrayed with David Kross playing a young Michael Berg, this, and her appreciation of having fine literature read to her dominate the opening scenes. During her trail for war crimes, Schmidt offers an ignorant innocence which condemns her. And although her subsequent self taught literacy apparently saves her, it also condemns her as well. Equally, although the cerebral berg enjoys a career as a lawyer, he too is emotionally repressed by the emotional maelstrom of that early affair from which he never recovers.Some minor irritations are present. All the actors speak in English, barely a German word is heard, and Winslet and Fiennes effect a light cod German accent. Consequently German authenticity is somewhat compromised.Mindful of the fact that the author of the original book is German ,and it is set entirely in Germany, I think that some concessions to the local language would have been accepted by an English speaking audience.If the screenplay is seen to favour Schmidt a little too sympathetically, a superb closing scene in which Llana Mather receives Bergs bequest more than corrects the balance. In a stunning cameo performance, actress Lens Olin, immaculately turned out in stark contrast to the wrecked and wretched Schmidt, refuses the money and informs Berg that there is 'nothing' to learn from the camps. Not in an educational , but nihilistic sense. It is her that she suggests that Berg should do with the money 'as he sees fit'. Itself, a metaphor for how we too should see this fine film.",9,2,3,8 January 2009
The Wrestler," Bloody Brilliant
","I am no fan of American style wrestling, yet this superb tale of an ageing, fading wrestler is a triumph. Lead, Mickey Rourke as Randy 'The Ram' Robinson delivers a career defining performance of pathos and power. The wrestling scenes are visceral and blood soaked, and the supporting cast consistently excel, however brief 'their moment'. Reputedly shot for under $7m, it does not have a low budget feel to it, proving once again that fine acting and a good script beat dollars and CGI. The dressing room and 'backstage' shots feature working wrestlers adding to the authenticity of the film.The lead story of 'The Ram's' demise is mirrored by the supporting sub plot of lap dancer Cassidy, who also 'sells' her flesh with time running out on her. Well played by the marvellous Marisa Tomei, who at 44, still has a body to be proud of, the part is underwritten and neatly contrasts with the hell-bound 'Ram'.Evan Rachel Wood plays a thoughtful cameo as Stephanie,Randy's estranged daughter, providing the film's most poignant scene as her father takes her to visit a childhood seaside haunt to reminisce and build bridges.'Raw' most accurately defines the films ambiance, whether it is the bruised and broken flesh of the ring, Randy's explicit 'tail-gunning' of a good time girl when he should have his mind on taking his daughter out for dinner, or his plaintiff desperation at pursuing the only thing he knows, wrestling, against the odds. It is rumoured that Nicholas Cage was screen tested for this role, which is odd, because it reprises some of the themes of Cage's role in 'Leaving Las Vegas'. The headlong crash to destruction, the 'tart with a heart' and a worthy script feature in both. A carefully chosen soundtrack ably underpins the proceedings, although Bruce Springsteen's custom written 'The Wrestler' is absurdly tossed away with the credits rather than interwoven into the story.My only real concern is where the audience is for this. The young and pre- teenage audience, the bedrock fans of wrestling are excluded by its certification. And the casual adult audience may not be attracted by the ostensibly 'uncool' subject matter. That would be a shame, as a sophisticated audience will appreciate the Shakespearian Tragedy of the plot, and Rourke's finest two hours.",9,1,2,20 January 2009
Hancock," Woeful Drivel
","Like many, i was seduced by the trailers for this movie, the reality left me mind numbingly disappointed. Lead actors Will Smith and Charlize Theron, a big budget and a good idea should give any Director a good head start, Peter Berg squanders it all in an unimaginative disaster.The script is cliché ridden and formulaic,and the 'happy moon' ending vomit inducing. In trying to straddle the comedy, action and superhero genres it falls flatly on its 'ass' (sic). The 'action' sequences are occasionally quite disturbing for a uk 12a certificate.Now I enjoy my Peckinpah and Tarrantino along with the best. however the convention for this certificate film is that the violence is 'comic book'.The opening sequence of hoodlums spraying a busy freeway, among which are chasing cops, with Uzi sub-machine gun rounds (several hundred a minute)is not Comic strip.The same is true when a Bank is held up and the robbers sprays the busy street with Uzi, heavy calibre machine gun and what looks like an RPG fire.Equally is having women and children wired up to Hamas style explosive vests funny? America has a serious problem with lone young gunmen and random massacres. The naive sanitization of these sequences helps no-one.Supporting actor Jason Bateman looks as uncomfortable as the part is, as part of the 'triangle' between himself,Theron and Smith. The use of the formers 'child' for the most excruciating 'kid' moments are frankly excruciating.The cinema was pretty full, I heard no-one laugh out loud once. the idea of a 'flawed' superhero is a good one. In the future it has the basis for a good film in the hands of some capable writers and a talented Director.",2,12,21,5 July 2008
Inception," Outstanding 21st Century Sci - Fi Thriller
","A brilliant film, and Director Christopher Nolan's best to date. Once in a while a good original idea, an intelligent script, and a fine cast come together. 'Inception' is one of those occasions. Any story that takes two and a half hours to tell on screen had better be good – and this is. The basic premise is fairly straight forwards. A mind invasion expert, Cobb, played by De Capprio, is hired to persuade the heir to a global conglomerate to break up the Corporation by a business rival .In return that rival promises that his influence will ensure that charges against Cobb in the US will be dropped.The opening act is disorientating as reality and dream are introduced to the viewer non-sequentially. Although the narrative does not initially make sense, the action is compelling enough. Then slowly the plot unfolds in a device that Nolan first explore in 'Memento'. Gradually the story makes sense via a young student, Ariadne, played by Ellen Page, who is hired to assist in the project .Yet just as we are getting to grips with a 'mind theft' plot a parallel plot emerges. That of Cobb's deceased wife, and the part he had to play in her death.Essentially, Nolan is playing with a device popularised in Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'. The play within the play, and he has a lot of fun with it. The opportunity it presents for non-linear action and narrative is exploited to the full, especially as he chooses to introduce the concept of three levels of dreaming. As a consequence, the viewer is forced to pay attention, simultaneously trying to make sense of the on screen action whilst reflecting how action in our own dreams works.There is little to find fault with. Pete Postlethwaite and Michael Caine relish minor roles and Marion Cotillard exudes mystery and beauty as Cobbs' wife. The myriad 'dream within dream' sequences provide multiple mini-action climaxes which do disrupt a conventional film narrative, yet the ending is a good old fashioned device of keeping the audience guessing.The handling of illusion and reality will delight 'Matrix' fans, whilst a shoot-out at a snowy mountain hideaway is pure Bond circa 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. So whilst Nolan explores the cerebral dimensions of the plot in a way that would have delighted Stanley Kubrik, he also relishes an action sequence as much as Jerry Bruckheimer.Easily amongst the best films of the 21st Century and destined to be a classic.",10,4,10,29 July 2010
Defiance," A Good Old Fashioned War Film
","It would be easy to pick holes in this picture. Based upon a true story, it tells the tale of the Bielski brothers who flee WW Two German persecution in Belarussia to take refuge in the forests. There is so much to draw upon, that it is inevitable that some issues are shown in shorthand, some glossed over, and some ignored altogether. But as a straight forwards Action/Adventure story, it succeeds admirably.Daniel Craig dominates the film as Tuvia Bielski and does a fine job. Stoic, rugged and with a passable local accent, he carries off portraying the dilemmas of his role as leader, and that of Action Hero, with some aplomb. Inevitably there are times when things teeter on the brink of a Sherwood forest, 'Robin Hood' ,pastiche, and the tone and violin playing veer into, 'Schindlers List', territory. But the essence of events; ordinary, disparate, diverse people with a common bond as Jews being forced to flee Genocide by living a subsistence existence in the wild forests is well told.Intriguingly, the ethics and morality of their position bedevils them in the same way that the contemporary Gaza Crisis bedevils modern day Israel. Tuvia slays the Policeman and sons who killed his family in cold blood, but opts for a survival strategy for his camp rather than that of raiding outpost. On one occasion they spare the lives of an informant and Policemen who stumble across their camp, compromising its existence rather than indulging in further slaughter. Yet later captured Germans are beaten to death by an exhausted and embittered camp.His brother Zus leaves with some others to join Soviet Partisans to follow a more aggressive Resistance. Fascinating sub- texts are flirted with; the anti-Semitism of the Soviet Partisans themselves, the hopeless position of villagers pressed by the Germans, Partisans AND Bielski, the 'forest wives' morality of the refugees versus a 'no-babies' policy, the class conflicts within the refugees themselves and the invidious position of the local Police Force.The beautiful forest, and noble cause of the Jews creates a Romantic air about the film where on the whole heroism and good triumph, and the Nazis and their sympathisers are shot. As is customary in the genre, women are for decoration only. Gritty realism and the raw underbelly of what life must really have been like understandably take a back seat. Yet this does not diminish the tale, and taken at face value, it is a compelling 137 minutes of cinema.",8,2,6,14 January 2009
Sherlock Holmes," A Triumphant Remake
","Guy Ritchie finally comes of age as a Director with this compelling re envisaging of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Ritchie's love of London, and his status as a Londoner, permeate every aspect of this tale as he cleverly uses familiar settings to represent familiar characters in a modern, yet faithful way. Robert Downey Jnr plays Holmes as an eccentric, other worldly eccentric. Jude Law plays Dr Watson as the straight 'foil' in a pairing that exudes chemistry and the obvious enjoyment of both men in their respective roles.Past Ritchie movies, in particular 'Lock, Stock...' and 'Snatch' have offered some wonderful set pieces, but a disjointed narrative. With the benefit of Holmes and Watson having an understood back story, and a well written and clearly defined plot, the surprise here is that this frees Ritchie up to deliver some excellent scenes in context. A fight in a shipyard's slipway is the pick of the bunch, closely followed by peril in an abattoir with shades of James Bond, a marvellously recreated bare knuckle fight reprises the grit that is his trademark, and the showdown on Tower Bridge is a glorious piece of kitsch.Many of the backdrops are computer generated , but this in no way detracts from the credibility of proceedings. Beautifully, and authentically costumed, but often shot in the dark, a slightly surreal sense of fantasy is created which serves the purposes of the plot perfectly. A witty, quick-fire script has verbal and visual gags aplenty which help to keep up a relentless pace in between action sequences. The editing never allows a pause for breath and the two hour running time flies by.Although the plot itself is neatly topped and tailed as villain Lord Blackwood, gleefully played by Mark Strong, is vanquished, an accomplice vanishes, leaving the door open for the sequel which will surely follow . That this will certainly be Ritchie's most successful film to date, yet contains no bad language or graphic violence, will cause many to reappraise his talents and may encourage Ritchie himself to explore further hitherto untapped areas in which he shows both promise and talent.",8,2,5,26 December 2009
Music and Lyrics," Light Inoffensive Entertainment
","One of the better Hugh Grant films, this frothy romp entertains without hitting any great heights.The synopsis of the plot is ;fading Eighties pop star and tune smith chances upon a lyricist/assistant plant waterer,they write a hit song and fall in love. And ,err, that really is about it.Grant and Barrymore never truly convince as a love match whilst offering solid performances. Grant does deliver a credible pastiche as a washed up fading pop star which teeters occasionally at parodying his own fragile status as an A list film star.The opening 'Eighties' video is great fun and well executed, and dare I say it, nostalgic! The music throughout is true to the vintage - and pretty passable. Grant and Barrymore are credited with singing their own songs. But the huge giveaway is that Martin fry , of eighties 'ABC' fame is credited with 'additional vocals'. I strongly suspect that he multi-tracked Grants vocals. Although Schlessinger, whose credentials I am unaware of, is credited with the music, i detect a strong Fry input into the end result.At 104 minutes the film is probably 15 to 20 minutes overlong. A scene where Barrymore meets her ex lover in a restaurant fails badly and smacks of 'filler'. Speaking of which her make up in the same scene looks as though it has been done by a thirteen year old further damaging a flawed set piece.Two supporting characters, those of Barrymore's film sister, and Cora, the Britney/Christina clone who commissions the song, excel and do much to assist a good, but limited , concept.",5,0,1,11 March 2007
Centurion," Entertaining but Short of Great
","This came out at around about the same time as Kevin MacDonald's 'The Eagle', based on the same historic incident, the disappearance of Rome's 9th Legion in what is now Scotland. Nothing is known of the circumstances of their demise, so Director Neil Marshall has free rein to interpret the event. Yet the plot elements bear some similarities with MacDonald's interpretation. Marshall is best known for his horror films 'Dog Soldiers' and 'The Descent', so unsurprisingly the rawness and gore of ancient living and battle is of particular interest to him. No battle scene is complete without graphic gouging, decapitation and limb severance.The Scottish countryside provides a magnificent visual backcloth to the film and the opening Pict assault on the Roman outpost is visceral and sets the standard for the subsequent battle scenes. The sole survivor, Quintus Dias(Michael Fassbender) then joins the 9th Legion to put down the Pict Rebellion only to suffer the Legion itself being all but wiped out in the stand-out scene of the film, a Pict ambush in a wooded valley. They are led into the ambush by a treacherous female Pict scout, Etain. However the dramatic impact of her role is limited by the fact that she is mute, having had her tongue ripped out by the Romans .A handful of Romans survive the ambush and learn that their General has been captured by the Picts which provides the pretext for an attack on the Pict camp. But they fail to free the general, murdering the Pict leaders son in the process which unsurprisingly has the Picts hunting them down with Etain in the lead. Two elements hinder this film, as they did 'The Eagle'. The Pictish language is sub-titled which restricts how much you can include for character development (which is negligible on the Pict side) and secondly an open landscape with overwhelming odds in favour of the Picts restrict dramatic tension considerably.The film is almost entirely plot driven, with very little characterisation. This is a shame because when it does draw breath, when Dias and his men find shelter and support from a Witch, the story takes on a welcome extra dimension and it provides a satisfying coda to the plot. Overall, 'Centurion' was not that well received by the critics. Apart from the ambush scene, it lacks the grand epic quality of 'Gladiator' and the story is scarcely enough for 97 minutes. Michael Mann's interpretation of 'Last of the Mohicans' set a modern day standard of 'heroes on the run in the wilderness' which all subsequent pretenders find hard to beat. But what it does do, it does well, bloody combat scenes. And these are sufficiently well done, and frequent enough to make it enjoyable enough .The head to head comparisons with 'The Eagle' are interesting. 'The Eagle's' opening scene and fort assault are better, and the use of a local slave as a guide whose loyalties are in doubt far better handled as a story. But once it gets going 'Centurion' is far stronger as the legion marches north, and the set piece battle wins hands down. 'The Eagle' is stronger in the Pictsish camp, but the 'Centurion' wins in the final pursuit with a more satisfying ending.Because so little is known about British history other than from Roman sources historical accuracy is not an important factor, but a plot problem is. The Romans are the invaders and when the heroes are the ruthless aggressors an audiences sympathy, especially in the united Kingdom, will be at best divided. Combine this with sketchy character development and you have a story which should be enough to satisfy the 'blood and splat' enthusiasts, but disappoint those hoping for a little more.",7,1,3,30 April 2011
Paths of Glory," Strong Early Kubrick Anti-War Film
","I watched this, some 53 years before it was made, without knowing anything about it. It transpires that this was a huge advantage in making an objective assessment of a film which has historically divided opinion. The context is important. Made in 1957, it was part of the double feature era when people went to the cinema to see two films, both under 90 minutes. The demand was that a full story be told in that time meaning that far more storytelling ground was often covered then than in modern day films. Certainly here, a longer running time or reduced content would have been a benefit.It was also made forty years after the end of the First World War in which the film is set. The mass slaughter was being objectively assessed against a backdrop of a 'just' second world war, and a futile Korean War which had ended where it started, but at a cost of a million miles. Although essentially an anti-war film , it does not succeed in having universal sentiments which transcend the time.The first awkwardness is that although the story is set in French lines, a stoutly English and American cast speak and act English. There is always a debate to be had about sub titles, but here the problem is greater than that. Virtually no attempt is made to make the characters, and their setting, feel French. This is so acute that on occasion it is easy to forget whether we are in French, British or America lines.George Macready is good and well cast as General Mireau, but a donkey leading lions. Yet the opening act offers a crude short hand of a venal, incompetent self-seeking command prepared to sacrifice their men for personal advancement. Kirk Douglas then appears as a more junior commander, Colenel Dax who is cajoled into undertaking an impossible assault on German lines. Dax's lines have no French reference at all, they are the words of an American Hero juxtaposed against a seemingly corrupt, ineffective French Military hierarchy, a narrative which would probably have played well at the time.The battle scene itself is well handled and convincing as the French launch an attack which is beaten back by the German positions. Yet the pivotal moment when x orders his gunners to fire on their own positions as troops refuse to leave their trenches under withering fire is crassly handled, and a little naive. The tradition of men refusing to follow orders facing death by their own side dates back at least to Roman times and was well practised in the first and second world wars by the Russians and Germans. Absolute obedience to orders IS a military imperative, yet instead we are invited to sympathise with those men who cowered in their trenches letting down those of their comrades who DID follow orders. The artillery officer refuses the order.Mireau orders that a body of men are summarily shot in the interests of discipline, and Dax, a qualified lawyer, provides his services in defence of the three accused. This act is undoubtedly the strongest as the folly of war is forensically dissected, transcending the moment. But then it falters again as Mireau is threatened with exposure by y for ordering French Artillery to shell their own lines to the Press. The reality is that there was no mass French Press then, the press that did exist was strictly establishment, and there was no chance that the story would have found its way into the paper. Late 1950's mores of American Press practises is superimposed wrongly in time and place.The summary execution of the token 'Cowards' is grandly set, and poignantly portrayed and perhaps the story should have ended there. But instead there is a denouement ( the only thing French about this film!) where Dax's soldiers take some rest and recreation to be entertained by a captured young German woman, later to be Mrs Kubrick in real life. Initially there is a suggestion that she will be gang –raped, but then she sings and unifies then all in a cloying, sentimental ending at odds with the ambitions of the film , but wholly consistent with a commercially acceptable close.The story is well told, and well acted, and is satisfying with numerous hints of the greatness to come. Its shortcomings, as only Kubrick's second feature are wholly excusable. But the madness of war is more completely explored in 'Dr Strangelove', it's visceral side more effectively explored in 'Full Metal Jacket' so this is no masterpiece, but a strong part of the Kubrick canon nonetheless.",6,4,7,4 July 2010
The Queen," Long Live The Queen
","This outstanding docudrama is far better than it has any right to be, and neatly tip toes around the many bear traps that were waiting for those involved in this film. Hehen Mirren has been awash with praise for her performance- and rightly so. She plays it straight, and incredibly by so doing, elicits a level of sympathy from the viewer that was noticeably absent at the time in real life.Cleverly, the supporting real life figures are played as caricatures by their actors. This enables some wickedly astute dialogue. Prince Philip is portrayed as the archetypal grumpy old man, Alastair Campbell as a venomous, self seeking, moral free gutter rat,and Prince Charles as a hand wringing, but sensitive soul. Cherie Blair will not be keeping her part saved on DVD ! Perversely the documentary footage adds credibility to the film , but eases off the power of the acted parts. Furthermore the scene where the Queen cries for the slain Stag is a bit too crassly symbolic for my tastes.Nevertheless the end result is a triumph for all concerned and sends the message that contemporary drama can work after the recent flop of 'Bobby' about Bobby Kennedy.",8,0,0,26 May 2007
Casino Royale," Strong new character- same plot shortcomings
","I have seen every new Bond film since the late - 60's and seen every one made.Like many, i was disappointed with the demise of Pierce Brosnan as Bond, and nervous about Daniel Craig's appointment. I needn'thave been.Craig brings an icy steeliness to the character not really seen since Connery. I loved Brosnan as Bond, but accept that he lacked menace.In Casino Royale, Bond is probably the most convincing menacing character, on screen. The opening post title chase sequence is not only one of the best Bond chases ever- it ranks with the best full stop.In itself it makes the film worth seeing. So, after these plaudits , whats wrong? The film is too long, and the last third lacks pace.The Card game sequence lacks power because we don't know enough about the players, and goes on for too long. the traditional female glamour associated with bond films is largely absent.Apart from Bonds' girl, and the baddies'girl, there is hardly a female in sight.What there is , is copiously clothed. By contrast, the interest in Bonds body is almost homo-erotic.Wehave the 'Dr No' Ursula Andress cloned Bond emerging from the water,and close ups of his bare chest and nipples on several occasions apart from his nude torture scene. The girls by contrast are firmly robed.The new Bond theme and incidental music is awful.I am all for contemporising themes.The 'Mission Impossible' and British TV 'Dr Who' themes are universally loved, but haveboth een given successful makeovers.This failed dismally.The Venice finale is risible and anti climactic, and little effort is made to capitalise on the dramatic opening fifteen minutes - the film gradually losing momentum thereafter.The overall verdict is that the Bond franchise is safe in the capable, and different hands of Craig. But how i long for a convincing, well paced, well written story line.",6,1,2,18 November 2006
Lucy," Pretty satisfying Cross Genre Piece
","Lucy is a sci-fi thriller, with pace, excitement and thrills. Director Luc Besson has a track record with action (Nikkita, District 13) and his touch here is sure, and assured. The ingredients are transparent. A strong Chinese section will play well to the fast emerging Far East market, with English subtitles, which will reverse in home markets. The denouement in Paris reflects the Canal + funding and Bessons' nationality, the French Cop even gets to kiss the girl! And the Englishman is the fey baddie, a wonderfully reptilian cameo by Julian Rhind Tutt.Besson does not allow himself to be too tied down by the requirements of genre. The opening scene is pure gritty action thriller as the eponymous Lucy finds herself helpless in a drug –trafficking plot, this then morphs into a superhero sequence as she ingests her packages. Thereafter there is a parallel sequence featuring the gravel voiced tones of Morgan Freeman, playing a cutting edge scientist and driving the sci-fi element with a surfeit of scientific psycho-babble, and all comes together for a cartoon style climax of increasing improbability.Scarlett Johansen, as Lucy, carries the part, short dresses and Loubouttin heels, with some style. Sassy, tough, vulnerable and determined she proves that female leads can command a film, an opportunity which is denied far too many actresses. Her nemesis, Mr Jang, played by Min Sik Choi has no such personality breadth, and is a convincing inscrutable, cruel killer.This is not a story that bears close examination, but it rattles along at some speed, works, and entertains. The car chase in Paris is convincing, but the shoot outs are stylised, losing some of the power that the opening scene offers. The idea of a drug which enhances human potential was explored quite recently in Limitless, Lucy trumps it for verve and brio. Purists of any of the aforementioned genres will carp, but the end package is pretty satisfying.",6,1,7,25 August 2014
Unbroken," Unbroken Tedium
","The true story of the wartime experiences of American Olympic athlete Louis Zamperini, this is he directorial debut of Angelina Jolie.The raw material is excellent. An immigrant who achieves Olympic glory for his adopted country, survival at sea after a crash landing, and victimisation in a Japanese POW camp by brutal captors. But somehow, Jolie's inexperience results in a story hat drags, and lacks dramatic tension. This is further compounded by an inappropriate title, as by the end Zamperini is broken.Production values are high, and the cinematography is excellent throughout. But the dialogue is poor, and the editing weak. Throughout, Jolie thinks that she is lingering to great dramatic effect, when she should have moved on.A two hour twenty running time is appropriate to the story, but Jolie does not know how to either tell a story, or fill the time. On the plus side, the door is still open for someone else to do a proper job on the story.",3,1,2,30 June 2015
Munich," An Almost Great film
","I was fourteen at the time of the Munich Massacre,followed the events closely, and have been interested ever since.The raw materials for a great film maker, and film, are all here:hate, fear, revenge, plotting, treachery and intrigue - Shakespeare would have loved to have had a go! Munich works best in providing snapshots of the assassins and their victims.The piano playing daughter of the Paris 'hit', the lover in bed with one of the Beirut 'hits', and the joy, then despair, of the families of the Munich hostages are all wonderful vignettes.The criticism from both Palestinian and Jewish supporters reflects a tremendous story telling discipline from Spielberg.However for a long film, some essential original detail was omitted which would have added to the drama.Before each 'hit', in reality,the widow of one of the Munich victims was 'tipped off' to watch the news by an anonymous caller.This complicity of Mossad and the Israeli Government in each assassination was ducked in the film apart from the implicit cooperation demonstrated in the Beirut raid.Was Spielberg too deferential to the Jewish lobby in this respect?Equally,the spineless capitulation of the West German Government in releasing the three captured Munich Terrorists following a high jacking was referred to as an incidental. In reality, this was the real driver for revenge with those three top of the wanted list.The neutral portrayal of the Arab victims consequently evokes a sympathy which does not do justice to the motivation for the assassins actions.I squirmed when the opening shots for Paris and London were the Eifel Tower and a red double decker bus.Audiences don't need that insult.As a Brit, the 'Twin Towers' shot at the end on the New York horizon totally passed me by until I read the reviews.The last quarter of the film is a mess.A failed 'hit' appears, then ends without explanation or reason.The real life assassination of the wrong man in Norway is omitted altogether, even though this was the catalyst for the end of the killing programme. So anxious is Spielberg to sit on the moral fence that he concentrates on the personal moral confusion of the chief assassin rather than the bigger moral picture.Ultimately, that is what limits the film. Great drama examines Great Moral issues by using personal drama to highlight them. Spielberg has done the personal moral drama well, but just holds back from the big picture.A fine, but flawed, effort.",6,0,1,29 January 2006
Get Him to the Greek," Dreary,lame,rubbish
","A dreadful unfunny mess for which Director Nicholas Stoller should take full responsibility . Russell Brand is a charismatic talent, Jonah Hill who plays opposite him as record company executive Aaron Green is not. The equal billing and screen time they receive, presumably for the benefit of American audiences, holes the film below the water line from the start. Hill is not up to it, and is miscast. The visual attraction of a tall handsome louche Brand and a short fat ugly Hill,I can accept. What I cannot accept is the total lazy confusion of what happens around them.The idea is fine, that of a washed up rock star, Aldous Snow, whose career is to be rejuvenated by a 10th anniversary concert . Green is charged with the task of getting Snow from London to the Greek Theatre in LA. That provides a platform for the straight Hill to be subjected to rock n roll depravity by Brand, but the mix doesn't work. Hill is not written as a foil for Brand, instead he has equal status and the energy drains from the film with every camera shot of him.Record Company President Sergio Roma, played by Sean Combs,is a character with promise which is wrecked by overuse of profanity and one dimensional characterisation. Beyond that every stereotype, writing by numbers, and cliché supporting cast that you could ever have hallucinated about in your worst nightmares appears here.The DVD contains an alternative opening and finale, both of which are far superior to those which are on the final edit. In the theatre version a messy, ambiguous, video shoot for Snows latest single is presented as a potential trailer or promo and is highly irritating. The alternative conventional scene of a country house launch party with the video being screened and other characters introduced makes far more sense. Equally a tedious official finish at the inevitably successful concert is vastly inferior to a quite witty alternative . the many deleted and alternative scenes are testament to the fact that Stoller seriously lost the plot here.The music is uniformly bad, many scenes are superfluous and boring, and the clichés about a rock n roll lifestyle choke the life out of the story. How Stoller and co-writer Jason Segal could have so succeeded with 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' but failed so abjectly with this is a mystery. Although not the worst film I have ever seen, it is close run thing.",2,13,31,30 December 2011
300," Fantasy Sword And Sandals Tale Delivers
","I was fortunate enough to study Ancient Greek at school, but was not familiar with Frank Miller's cartoon books in general, or his work on this story in particular. I have to confess that I thoroughly enjoyed this imaginative take on a famous tale.The Spartans were a legendary warrior state, and the battle of Thermopalae arguably one of the most famous ever. The fact that Herodotus faithfully recorded these events in some detail provides a firm base for a fantasy with two feet firmly placed in fact.Boldly, the majority of the films almost two hour running time is indeed taken up by action sequences. As such, the blood and gore count is of Tarrantinoesque proportions - but it's fantasy portrayal allows much more to be shown than might otherwise be acceptable.Gerard Butler gives a Mel Gibson inspired 'Braveheart' performance as King Leonidas and is ably supported by Lena Headley as his wife and Queen in what amounts to a cameo role. Don't be put off by the snobbish put downs of some commentators - she has a role to ply and does it in caricature style. His opponent, Xerxes, is curiously played by a Julian Clary lookalike,Rodrigo Santoro,in comic book style.The music and imagery coasts dangerously into 'Gladiator' territory, but the battle set pieces are tremendous with the fantasy portrayal allowing maximum scope for dramatic license. And lets not forget that the Greeks loved a good story. Leonidas response to the Persians threat that they will block out the sun with their arrows -'Then we shall fight in the shade then' is stirring stuff and reflects a mock pompous script which is lively without taking itself too seriously.Not as epic as 'Gladiator', or as Fantastical as 'Lord of the Rings', this film still scores within its own agenda - don't let the purists from either the Historic or Comic Book factions put you off. Great story - well told.",6,0,1,30 April 2007
Fast Five," Preposterous Fun
","I viewed this 'blind' without having seen any of the previous 'Fast & Furious' offerings. Previously a series which apparently involved car theft and street racing held little appeal . I am pleased to report that my preconceptions were wrong, and I thoroughly enjoyed two hours and twenty minutes of preposterous fun.The moral problem of rooting for robbers is side-stepped by the fact that they are robbing from even badder guys – a drug baron and his cartel. Vin Diesel enjoys himself enormously as the robbers head honcho, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson enjoys himself even more as Hobbs his special forces nemesis charged with hunting him down.The plot itself is a classic Hollywood formula. The robbers double cross each other, the good guys are sent to catch the bad guys who are out to steal from the even badder guys. The chief good guy hooks up with the prettiest girl, the bad guys come unstuck, but so do the good guys, who then form an understanding to thwart the even badder guys.Director Justin Lin directs with style and brio with car scenes used sparingly, and therefore very effectively, the gaps being filled in with old fashioned heists, rip-offs, foot chases and shoot-outs. Elena Neves as the honest cop is hot and shades Jordana Brewster as the gangsters moll. The Brazilian/ Rio location shots are milked for all they are worth with plenty of swooping over the favelas, Christ the Redeemer ,the Corcovado mountain and the Copacabana.The climax, a raid on a vault is plain silly, but great fun and Paul Walker is excellent throughout playing alongside Vin Diesel. A minor problem is that the normally imposing Diesel is physically dwarfed by Dwayne Johnson who is clearly here to stay for the next instalment. An adrenaline rush from start to finish with blue skies, stunning scenery, pretty girls, muscle bound guys and fast cars , clichéd? Yes. Fun ? Hell, yes too!",8,0,1,31 May 2011
Moon," A Decent if Uneven Effort
","A qualified success for the Directorial Debut of Duncan Jones, aka David Bowie Junior, aka Zowie Bowie. Science Fiction films are a niche, and neglected market.When you strip out those born of TV series, there is precious little left. Jones, who wrote the story but not the Screenplay, delivers bona fide science fiction, sans gratuitous CGI, but with a strong, resonant plot and some convincing acting.The premise of proceedings is that of a sole engineer on a lunar mining station just a few weeks from coming home. Actor Sam Rockwell, as that engineer Sam Bell, then has to confront a turn of events which leads him, and the audience, to question his sanity,identity and pretty much everything around him.With only the intelligent robotic voice of Gerty, the on board computerised robot, amusingly delivered by Kevin Spacey, the 97 minute running time gives ample time for reflection.This is not perfect by some way.The sets and effects are basic and crude, rather than spartan and austere, and the piano theme often grates rather than haunts.The editing also tries unnecessarily to confuse for effect what is a good story anyway.Trudie Styler has a Producer credit. As wife of Sting, a decent actress in her own right, and God mother to Guy Ritchie's Rocco she clearly has some strong connections in the film making world.It is to her credit that this is manifested in a well made, credible work rather than pompous self indulgent vanity project amongst the rich and famous.At times the isolation becomes almost too claustrophobic, and Jones does not have the confidence to go for the broad themes as genre Masterpieces Bladerunner and 2001 a Space Odyssey do. Yet this is the first 'proper' sci fi film of the 21st Century. As such Jones lays down a solid marker for his peers, and offers much promise for his future development.",5,3,12,17 July 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," A Colourful, Visceral Triumph
","Very occasionally a film comes along which has the potential to change the face of Commercial Cinema, Slumdog Millionaire is one of them. Hollywood represents the bulk of cinematic history and is still the driving force behind it. But we live in a changing world. Politically we are seeing a resurgent Russia, and the emergence of China and India as economic super powers. Cinema is only now starting to pick up those shifts.The American Film Industry, like its Motor Car Industry, has grown fat and lazy. Tired plots, formulaic scripts, predictable locations and a wearisome reliance on big budgets, CGI and big explosions to 'deliver' have made it increasingly less interesting, and relevant, to World audiences, and I suspect to home ones too.So here we have a film shot totally in India, mainly in Mumbai, with no Western actors, no 'names', and a substantial amount of dialogue in Hindi, sub titled into English. (You can almost hear the LA Exec writing the reject slip for the pitch, can't you?). At first glance English Director, Danny Boyle, is not the obvious choice. But on closer inspection you consider the visual big budget feasts which were 'Sunshine' and 'The Beach', the pacey drama of 'A Life Less Ordinary', the visceral grittiness of '28 Days Later' and 'Trainspotting', and the low budget/ gallows humour of 'Shallow Grave' and you have the ingredients which make 'Slumdog's ' success.Cinematically it is a joy, rich colours, beautifully shot, blaze across the screen. The locations enthral. OK the Taj Mahal is predictable, but nonetheless breathtaking, the slums a vibrant cesspit. The acting is convincing and compelling, wonderfully led by Dev Patel as Jamal Malik the eponymous hero. Heaving with brilliant cameos, watch out for the Police Inspector, his fat side kick, and the evil Orphanage 'Fagin'.It is true that Hollywood cliché may have been swapped for Bollywood cliché . But as a 'cross-over trailblazer for a largely unsuspecting audience, that is forgivable ,it works. Beware that although the story does have the advertised feel-good ending, the content has the trademark Danny Boyle rawness which is frequently uncomfortable, and in one case unwatchable. But that rawness also delivers the funniest, ' shittyest' scene of the picture!A classic 'rages to riches' premise, told with style and innovation, a landmark film.",9,1,3,18 January 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," Boring and disappointing
","I have watched all the Mad Max films from the start. The first was low budget, but compelling, with a young Mel Gibson at his best. The second and third took the idea to another level with a big budget, and a softer crossover into the Sci-fi/Western mainstream. A reboot seemed like a good idea with no need for Mel Gibson to reprise his earlier eponymous role. But what seemed like a good idea, with George Miller directing turns out to be a bad idea. The budget is massive. The landscapes are panoramic, the retro-futuristic war wagons a delight. The plot and script is a disaster. I wanted to enjoy it. The second twoinstalments were apocalyptic fantasies, but laced with a sense of humour, and charm. This is charmless. Fury Road's opening scene is a chaotic tour de force featuring the capture, then escape of Mad Max. Only as the opening draws to an end do the doubts start, his ability to defy the hoards becomes a little preposterous. Still we have the first road chase to entertain us. But as it unfolds the truth dawns- that is all there is. One long chase.Instead of the myriad possibilities that a dystopian future offers, we are instead funnelled into the confines of the car chase, a poor man's Fast and Furious.Tom Hardy is fine as Mad Max, co- star Charlize Theron is de-glammed as rebel Imperator Furiosa. Glamour is provided , bizarrely, by a small cohort of white robed vestal concubines. However as the chase unfolds, repetition creeps in, and disaster strikes an action film, I became bored. There is only so much you can do with a car chase, and those possibilities do not cover a 120 minute running time. Shooting airborne BMX'ers is a good joke, but after a while isn't.All this is a shame. Some of the detail is good. Oxygen masks with wolfs' teeth, a battle party led by a rock guitarist shooting flame from his axe, the spectacular sets, shot in Nabibia. But it isn't enough. The established vision is reheated with no new direction, and the interminable running time just leaves you asking 'why?' I can't really comment on the acting as there is none, the characters just perform the storyboard. Such a waste of money and resource. The idea of Mad Max remains a good one- but a new director is needed to realise its potential.A budget of half and a running time of ninety minutes would have concentrated minds. Instead of allowing ours to wander.",2,8,17,14 October 2015
The Pursuit of Happyness," Mawkish, lumbering dross
","I viewed this film cold, knowing nothing about it, and left it cold. The tale of Chris Gardner,played by Will Smith, a down on his luck black travelling salesman, making good as a Stockbroker has narrative potential. But Director Gabriele Muccino, whose track record is hitherto with foreign language films, squanders it.I didn't really like Chris Gardner.His pursuit of the stockbroker 'Dream' is at the expense during the film, of a squalid life for his young son. His wife, played by Thandie Newton,has a horribly underwritten role. her inability to look after their son, at least in the short term, is never clear.His co workers at the stockbrokers are all pretty shallow, and objectionable characters - is this really the dream that he is chasing? The narrative hinges on an ever increasing series of disasters and hurdles which impede his 'pursuit of happiness'. Yet the uplifting element required to counterbalance this in the minds of the audience never really works.At 117 minutes the running time is a good 30 minutes too long. After 90 minutes I found myself saying to myself, 'look he gets the job at the end, can we just finish now?'Essentially episodic in style, there are some good moments, and good characters, but Muccino fails to 'join up the dots'. For a film so dark and downbeat, racism and the cynicism of the financial world gets a super-gloss. The happiness that he finds at the end is a Stockbrokers job which subsequently earns him millions . Wow.A total miss fire. This story should either have been rewritten as a straight comedy - and it could have worked as such, or as a cinema 'verite' piece, warts and all. It wasn't, so it fails.",3,5,7,15 July 2007
Valkyrie," Dire War Disaster Movie
","Certainly the most miscast, and probably the most misconceived, War film I have ever seen. Director Bryan Singer made a modern classic with 'The Usual Suspects' ,but his milieu is television. This comes across as a big budget / low brain effort which pulverises an essentially good story into pulp. At the heart of everything is the casting and accents. A predominantly British cast play the Germans in strong British accents, Cruise plays Stauffenberg with an American accent that veers into British from time to time. Consequently the whole film feels like a giant fancy dress party.The sets, and costumes are convincing. The dialogue is not. I wanted to suspend disbelief, but when the English speaking accents are compounded by situations, speech and phrasing which are wholly un-Germanic that is nigh on impossible. In 'The Usual Suspects', Singer started at the end and then worked back to it, a device used in 'Carlitos Way' by Brian De Palma, and therein lies another challenge. We know what happens, the assassination plot fails, so how do you deal with that to retain dramatic tension? The answer is that Singer doesn't. De Palma created a Shakespearean tragedy, but Singer is no De Palma, and the script and story does not allow Cruise to replicate Pacino as the man condemned to an inevitable fate. So the film constantly struggles to find it's artistic raison d'etre.Historically, the film is flawed. Inevitably Cruise plays Stauffenberg as the 'good guy', the truth was far more complex, and interesting than that, but the screenplay has no time to flesh that out. There is an ongoing intrinsic conflict between what and who is right and wrong in the story. Perversely the denouement shows loyal soldiers making the right practical decisions in crushing the coup which is an odd moral to emerge as a defining theme.The rise of Hitler. His mass popular support. His ability to turn proud Nationalism into ghastly genocide, and the lack of resistance to him are all big, film worthy topics. The mechanics of a coup in a powerful country, with a strong regime at War is also intriguing stuff. The conflicting demands that soldiers and citizens have to their country, their leader, and right and wrong are timeless matters. All this is squandered by a treatment that would barely get off a cartoon storyboard.Frustratingly the story of the plot is a worthy theme, and the events bear critical and dramatic examination, but this offering misses the target so spectacularly that if offers nothing to the debate. For those with no interest in history, looking for straight forwards entertainment this is passable, but no more.",3,30,50,31 January 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," Banal Drivel
","A quite good idea is needlessly tortured by a ridiculous plot which has the protagonists looking embarrassed pretty much throughout. The premise is one of a classic revenge tragedy. The execution is a flawed 'painting by numbers' attempt at the vigilant genre.It fails horribly. Director Gary Gray has had an unremarkble career to date, this will do nothing to improve matters.Gerrard Butler plays wronged citizen Clyde Shelton whose wife and daughter are attacked and killed as he watches on helplessly in a raid on his house.The scene is not dissimilar to 'Death Wish'.Jamie Foxx plays plea bargaining lawyer Nick Rice who has to deal with the aftermath as ten years on Shelton takes his revenge.But quickly the plot then shifts into 'Saw - Jigsaw' territory, however as the story demands multi-settings and pace, it then shifts gear again into thriller/hi tech crime mode.This identity crisis does it no favours.The moral dimension remains largely unexplored and most of the characters are so tedious that their death's represent nothing less than mercy killings. The supporting cast is dreadful, none worse than Viola Davis who offers one of the worst, least convincing, acting performances I have ever seen.There is potential in the scenario of a suspect seemingly wreaking havoc from behind the prison walls, but the explanation, when revealed, is so preposterous, and the ending, just plain stupid.To be found in the bargain bins at a DVD outlet near you soon.",3,15,19,4 December 2009
Furious 7," Big Budget Brouhaha
","If you want girls, guns, fast cars and lots of explosions this will not disappoint. A mixture of James Bond, Expendables, Mission Impossible, Bourne and the A Team on crack cocaine, the story races along, looking good, with the volume cranked up to ten. In the credits the stunt crew easily outnumber the actors.The set pieces are outstanding. A motorised parachute drop and car escape from skyscraper to skyscraper stand out. More routine sequences with a coach on the edge of a cliff, and a helicopter and drone attack in a city's streets are no less effective. The script is corny, the cod philosophy risible, the jeopardy unconvincing – but who cares? You have girls, guns, fast cars and lots of explosions.Jason Statham is solid as the baddie, Vin Diesel is of course cool as **** the hero. Kurt Russell acquits his role well as the mysterious Government Mr Fixit. Djimon Hounsou glowers in an underwritten role, Paul Walker is as reliable as ever and will be missed following his untimely death in a road traffic accident. Director James 'Saw' Wan is relentless in his storytelling. Nathalie Emmanuel smolders and shimmies as the hacker.Although the seventh in the series, the drone strikes , hacking, and omniscient surveillance maintains the films contemporaneity and stays abreast of the day, the appeal of a fast car is of course timeless. Fans will be delighted, the curious will have more than enough to engage them,this is no thriller, just an action ride, but an excellent one.",7,0,14,10 September 2015
