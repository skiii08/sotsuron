E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Extra-ordinary
","E.T. is one of my most favorite movies. I like Steven Spielberg movies. He always have the kids as the lead characters in many movies. And also the Alien character is narrated harmless and non-violent which is very impressive to me. The Cinematography and Special Effects are simply superb. And in specific, I've to mention the inspiring Music Score of the 5 times Academy Award Winner (including E.T.) John Williams. I never forget his Theme Music to this movie and I'm still hearing the sounds.The movie overall is Great! I watched this movie's 2002 (DTS version) at Theatre for the first time and many times on TVs.",9,3,5,18 May 2005
