The Blair Witch Project," A Reworking Of The Horror Genre
",The cultural phenomenon that was The Blair Witch Project cannot be overstated. The found footage era of filmmaking caught hold and became the main way to put forth the horror genre for years. Despite the hundreds of movies that have used this technique only a handful have been any good.The Blair Witch Project succeeds more on what you can't see than what you can. The human terror of darkness is used to full effect here and the actors do such a stellar job of being immersed in the fear of the unknown that it swoops you right along with them. The Blair Witch Project stands as a classic that is still unsettling but also stretched the rules of a genre and how films were made and seen.,10,2,4,25 October 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Trashy Weak And Overly Long
",This movie suffered from every single malady possible. Ryan Gosling is such a twerp that to put him in the same room with Harrison Ford is blasphemy. This movie! It took us on K's journey for 2 hours only to find out he was nobody. The girl behind the glass is the key to everything of course cause it's post 2016. Even when the movie would become engaging it would follow up by going back to sleep. Director Denis Villeneuve attempts to capture the dark atmosphere of the original Blade Runner but Ridley Scott he is not and his reliance on CGI doom this thing to a polished piece of plastic.,5,1,5,28 September 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Bill And The Bride Is A No Chemistry
",A bit of a comedown from the first namely because the final confrontation between the bride and Bill never quite jells into anything interesting. It all feels like less than the first part.,7,1,2,22 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worse Than Gungan DuDu
","Ok so I know a lot of you hate The Last Jedi and I certainly ain't gonna argue with you guys on that but it certainly is better than this steaming pile of Gungan dudu no matter how you slice it. If George Lucas had some kind of coherent story arc for how Anakin Skywalker turned to the dark side we didn't need to sit through 2 hours and 13 minutes of kid Vader going through his child banter, quips and going has.
Visually this is not good either. For a guy who was waiting for the technology to catch up to his vision the CGI here looks worse than either Terminator 2 or Jurassic Park.
Well we all collectively hate Jar Jar Binksso let's not even bother going into what a disaster he was. The Gungans were awful and the pod race as pointless as the Harry Potter quidditch match.
Darth Maul was cool as was the political intrigue around Senator Palpatine.
This was a hot mess and a poor start to a trilogy we'd waited 20 years for. It only gets a six rating from me cause of Darth Maul and some of the performances in it.",5,0,1,11 December 2019
The Equalizer," Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua make magic again!
","This dang thing is near perfect. It introduces you to Robert McCall, the man and his inner character before it unleashes it's hammer. Once the action starts though it's relentless and taut. Denzel Washington inhabits both sides of the character completely and seamlessly. Martin Csokas is sadistically at home as the tattooed Russian psychopath Nicolai Itchenko. Director Antoine Fuqua of Training Day fame once again delivers a winner for Denzel.",8,0,2,26 September 2019
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Indiana Jones Versus A Bunch Of Nazis
",Spielberg pays tribute to the golden age of serials. Harrison Ford and Karen Allen are perfectly cast as is the creepy Nazi artifact hunter Major Toht played with much gusto by the late Ronald William Lacey. Thrills and spills for the whole family.,9,2,3,22 August 2019
It," IT is good but not very scary
",Despite it being an entertaining movie the first chapter of Stephen Kong's IT is not as scary as it should be. What gets in the way is it's big budget slickness that feels a bit like a kids movie after a while. The performances are all great especially Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise who on his own would have been terrifying if the CGI sheen hadn't gotten in the way. Definitely worth the watch.,7,0,1,30 October 2019
Hereditary," Gasp!
","Full of pain and suffering this movie just boils and boils with first, the discomfort of real tragedy and second with the supernatural. Gut wrenching and frightening.",7,0,2,22 August 2019
Rocketman," Captain Fantastic
",This movie takes the fantasy elements of Bohemian Rhapsody and cranks up the myth making to ten. Visually stunning it's a delight for the casual fan but irritating for the hardcore. Fast and loose with facts and song timelines it's still entertaining enough,6,0,1,2 September 2019
Fury," A Fun Little Fiction About Blowing Up Nazis
",Once again Brad Pitt is taking names and killing Nazis in this burner of a movie that both succeeds and fails in its attempt at realism in war. The tank shots look too much like Star Wars blaster shots to not be distracted by but the gritty performances of the main characters is engaging enough to keep one interested in their predicament: to ride through Germany in the last days of the war and not get killed doing it. Brad Pitt gives a more human performance than his Inglorious Basterds counterpart. Often savage and in turn paternalistic. At times achieving both. Some of it stretches the boundaries of belief a little too thin but heck it's a lot of fun. There's an odd and uncomfortable 30 minute interlude at a dinner table that is way longer than it needs to be. Other than that the movie moves at breakneck speed.,7,0,0,26 September 2019
Inglourious Basterds," Nazi Killing Time
",Quentin Tarantino reimagines France under the Nazi occupation with Brad Pitt thrown into the mix for extra badassery. As always Tarantino knows how to mix tense filled dialogue scenes that are pure cinematic gold. Though this reworking of history doesn't hit the home rub that Once Upon A Time In Hollywood does it's still better than everyone else,8,0,3,20 October 2019
Captain Marvel," MCU Starts To Fizzle
","The Marvel movie universe succeeds mostly because it followed closely in the spirit of the 60's age of superheroes. Captain Marvel fails because it chose to be a political thesis on modern politics without giving us a compelling hero, villain or storyline. So begins the deconstruction of the MCU characters by giving us a clueless Nick Fury and a bland unlikable Carol Danvers. I fully expect this road to be taken all the way into the sewer by Disney. Blech.",4,3,5,20 August 2019
World War Z," The Final Days Of The Zombie Movie
",Released at the end of the zombie apocalypse craze World War Z was going to be pretty tough going for audiences over saturated with The Walking Dead and countless other terrible undead cannibal fare. This starts off pretty pedestrian and actually becomes a tense little vehicle for the genre. The scenes in Jerusalem are extremely effective and Brad Pitt plays an understated everyman attempting to find the source of infection. This is nowhere near as great as the Dawn Of The Dead remake but it will entertain. It won't change your mind about being fed up with zombie movies but at least you'll be engrossed enough to enjoy it.,7,2,3,4 November 2019
Hostel," A Torture Gore Cornucopia
",Eli Roth delivers a gore fest that you'll not soon forget. This is where things go after SAW and the results will either repel you or repel/ fascinate. A well crafted piece of torture porn Hostel takes the genre to a ramped up level. It should scare you or at least disgust. Worth the watch if you can bear it.,7,4,5,16 November 2019
The Irishman," You Can't Go Back
",I went into this expecting a high energy conclusion to the Good Fellas/ Casino era..a kind of trilogy to the mob influence on American culture. While the movie did attempt to deliver on this the conclusion was a kind of geriatric ward for once robust acting giants. I was most excited to see the return of Joe Pesci and all we got was a husk of a performance. He seemed half asleep and frankly it felt like he didn't want to be with here. DeNiro just bounced from scene to scene making faces and kind of got through it adequately. Harvey Keitel was hardly in it.The one saving grace was Al Pacino. He ran away with every scene he was in. He didn't just coast on a once relevant reputation. One of his best performances in years.Scorsese's direction seemed a little off..overbloated script with sudden bursts of violence that weren't very memorable. Not a bad movie but not a great one either. Too bad cause this is probably the last time we'll see these iconic actors together on film.,7,4,9,1 December 2019
Superbad," One Funny Joke Over And Over Again
",Pretty funny vulgarian humor with some great actors to pull the whole thing off. It's a bit of a one joke movie but a funny one nonetheless,6,0,2,23 September 2019
Terminator Salvation," Life After Judgement Day
",MTV acolyte McG helms this outing in the Terminator franchise. This one takes some chances in stepping out of the usual hunter/ hunted trope and actually moves into life after judgement day. It works fairly well and brings a fresh pushing forward of the franchise. The special effects are gritty and believable and though a bit disjointed in pace it works well. A shame this was never fleshed out further with a sequel.,7,1,2,9 November 2019
The Terminator," Schwarzenegger Rising
",A towering achievement in science fiction filmmaking. The Terminator provided a simple but genius storyline that mixed elements of the genre along with the action movie. Director James Cameron brought this fully realized vision of future technology gone awry and dropped it right in the lap of 1984. This movie made a mega star out of Arnold Schwarzenegger and boosted grounded modern sci fi as the heir apparent to horror. As important as Blade Runner. Along with Aliens the best science fiction of the 80s.,10,0,2,31 October 2019
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino Hits High Marks With Second Western
",Tarantino always delivers new ways to put forth tried and true cinematic themes. The Hateful Eight is his 2nd foray into the western genre and although this doesn't reach the high powered triumph of Django Unleashed it's still a cut above most. A kind of play on The Thing by John Carpenter Hateful Eight follows the theme of the enemy among us. Spectacular cast of which Samuel L. Jackson takes center stage in a complete reversal of his character in Django the movie almost entirely takes place in a cabin. From here is where the story of opposing political and moral themes come full throttle into a death grip with each other. High end filmmaking is such a pleasure to experience.,8,1,2,16 November 2019
Alien," Iconic
","Ridley Scott changes the face of modern sci fi with this mixing of high and lowbrow cinema. The clean antiseptic space of Star Trek, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Star Wars is turned into a dirty dank nightmare with winding corners and a monster right out of my he horror genre. H.R. Giger's monster and set designs are as iconic as they are still relevant today. Also Sigourney Weaver as the female heroine action hero is historical. One of the greatest movies ever made.",10,0,1,25 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," This Is A Hijack Of Star Wars
","This is one frustrating movie because it attempts to course correct the worst aspects of the nasty man hating self righteous Last Jedi and to save the huge missteps Kathleen Kennedy allowed or maybe demanded of Rian Johnson at the same time. What we get is a full on mad dash for fan acceptance that almost no one is gonna like. The first ten minutes feel like the actors did a bunch of coke and thought that acting meant hurling your lines in choppy disjointed cadences.
The heroes skip from one place to another without warning or directly after exposition dumps. You completely understand that this stuff was being made up on the spot as they tumbled down a hill trying to explain plot points the previous movie ruined. The CGI was pedestrian and the characters hollow as the souls of the ideologically possessed creators who allowed Last Jedi to finish any semblance of cohesion the trilogy might have had. I enjoyed Mark Hamill and Adam Driver did his best with what he had. The movie exposes itself in the end with the lead character stealing the very idea and spirit of Star Wars...this isn't Star Wars..this is just a veneer with a name slapped on it just like the final scene in this movie.",5,11,20,21 December 2019
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Jason Bourne Trilogy is Magnificent!
","A taut thriller that'll keep you on the edge of your seat for its two hour run. The Bourne trilogy comes to its conclusion and boy does it deliver...car chases, close quarter fist fights and enough government secret agency dirt to keep you guessing where it goes. So much fun.",8,0,0,20 September 2019
The Bourne Identity," Jason Bourne is realistic and exciting!
",This is one great piece of spy/ thriller/ action goodness. Matt Damon absolutely reinvents himself into a total badass while at the same time retaining his boyish sensitivity. The action scenes are claustrophobic and intensely realistic. Loved it.,8,1,1,18 September 2019
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Sexy T-X Makes The Movie
","Despite the hate it gets Terminator 3 is a solid movie that ties off the trilogy nicely and wraps the characters in a loop that takes us round to the first movie. Kristanna Loken is perfect as the T-X, a new more advanced Terminator sent to kill the adult John Conor this time. Her deadpan performance really brings a emotionless but murderous reality to the character. Robotic perfection. The action and special effects are very well done and the ending brings the story arc to a it's logical conclusion.
The problem here is casting Nick Stahl and Claire Danes as John Conor and his prospective romance partner Katherine Brewster, have no chemistry and even worse it becomes a stretch to accept Stahl as a future leader of humanity when those qualities are missing in the entire performance here.
Flawed it may be but Arnold Schwarzenegger battling Kristanna Loken is still amazingly fun. Go rent it or better yet, buy it!",7,8,11,8 November 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Great Great Great
",A sequel that outshines the perfect original. For this outing Cameron decided to move in a more standard action movie big budget Hollywood direction that syncs up seamlessly with the science fiction aspects of the story. This outing throws out the dark tense tones of the first and instead transcends the genre into an across the board crowd pleaser. The technical aspects of its early CGI still hold up today. A flawless blend that produced one of the best action/ sci fi movies of all time. Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger are perfect in this thing.,10,1,1,2 November 2019
Spider-Man," Spider-Man Finally Arrives!
",Though filled with pacing problems and a genre still finding it's legs Spider Man is a great addition to the pre MCU superhero genre. Tobey Maguire best encapsulates the spirit of Spider Man...although I'm not fully sold on Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin it's a really good solid beginning,7,0,1,28 August 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Whatever Avengers
",After the initial glow wore off I liked this a lot less. The deconstruction and wiping of the main characters was disappointing and the time travel plot was a mess. The final battle was just ok. Robert Downey and Scarlett Johansson shine.,5,2,7,20 August 2019
No Country for Old Men," Terrifying And Nihilistic
",Nihilism and the arbitrary coin of fate are at the heart of this Coen Brothers' masterwork. Not for the faint of heart. It's both brutal and despairing in tone even with those you'd find most innocent. Javier Bardem is terrifying as the psychopathic Anton Chigurh. Tense as anything you'll ever see.,9,2,2,21 September 2019
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Smaug Dissapoints
",While An Unexpected Journey wasn't that great it was professional and entertaining. This second one is just bad. The pointless subplots they tack on to this derail the entire movie. Gandalf seems doddering and confused a lot of the time and Smaug is merely adequate,6,0,1,5 November 2019
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," An Artful Slow Look At The Jesse James Story
",A towering slow burn on the pitfalls of hero worship. A narrative on the myth of fame and how men come to worship illusions spun by media. The tale of Jesse James played by Brad Pitt with such skill and substance that he alternates between sympathy and menace with stunning swiftness. One of Pitt's greatest performances. Casey Affleck as the nervous butt kissing Robert Ford also gives his best performance in this. The slow pace of the movie makes its sudden violence jarring and that's how it probably was back in the days when America was still young. A thoughtful provoking movie. Check it out.,10,1,2,18 November 2019
Batman Begins," The Dark Knight Revorn
",Christopher Nolan reinvents the Batman universe with a much darker vision than the previous films. Christian Bale is a far more visceral Batman than we've seen before and his journey toward becoming the hero is meticulously chronicled. The psychological make up of Bruce Wayne's boyhood trauma is shown and it's scars that affect him as a grown man are depicted in a totally plausible light.Bruce Wayne's metamorphosis into Batman is the movie's strongest point. However once the Batman part of the story the interesting villain is passed over for the pedestrian Ra's Al Ghul played by Liam Neeson. I think the more compelling Scarecrow might have been a better foe because of the interesting dichotomy of how both he and Batman use fear as a tool for directly opposing purposes. Nonetheless Batman Begins is a refreshing retelling of the Batman myth is.,8,0,1,6 October 2019
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An Unexpected Meh
",I wanted to love this but found it mildly disappointing at best. Everything is just there and kind of flat...the CGI is terrible and only the exchange between Bilbo and Gollum work. I haven't read the book in years but I'm pretty sure these kind of Conan like sequences weren't part of Tolkien's narratives.,7,0,1,24 October 2019
It Follows," A Good Little Horror Movie
",A creepy little horror flick about sexually transmitted disease where the disease is replaced with a shape shifting demon. The movie is tense and taught and keeps you on the edge for it's run. Very entertaining.,7,0,0,31 October 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Gutsy
",This gutsy indictment of modern movies disguised as a retro timepiece is just spectacular. Tarantino delivers his answer to any criticism the twitter mob will heap on him well in advance in the climax of this sprawling beast of a movie. Brad and Leo are phenomenal. Best I've seen this year.,10,20,30,20 August 2019
Django Unchained," Tarantino Hits The Mark
","Tarantino goes full High Plains Drifter meets Roots meets Ring of the Niebelung in this epic story of slavery, empowerment, love and revenge. It's Tarantino's most romantic film and one of his best. Leonardo DiCaprio's slaver Calvin Candie character is as charming as he is full of malice...Samuel L. Jackson is also wonderful as the equally malevolent house slave Stephen. A peek into the dark pit that was slavery Django Unchained is a must see.",9,1,4,11 November 2019
Ex Machina," Artificial Intelligence Unease
",Atmospheric and tense this dreamlike meditation of God and its' creation's creations leaves you uneasy. It is a nightmare within a daydream and it makes for good science fiction.,7,0,0,20 August 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," 'I'm going to Kill Bill!'
",A tribute to the 70s chop socky flick Kill Bill vol. 1 is a relentlessly paced action masterwork. Beautifully choreographed action scenes explode onscreen and Uma Thurman is glorious as The Bride.,8,1,2,28 August 2019
Paranormal Activity," The Unseen Fear Works Wonders Here
",Some people who are used to seeing CGI demon faces at every turn won't find this scary in the least but if you have a dread of lights inexplicably turning on in the next room or that which is there but unseen you'll find this terrifying. The ' found footage' genre that started with The Blair Witch Project is resurrected here with spectacular results. The fear of inhuman invisible enemy saturates this movie with the simplest of movie tricks...moving doors...knocks on the walls..shadows...all this is blended with the sympathetic portrayal of haunted Katie and her skeptical smart ass boyfriend Micah. This movie stands as one of the best horror movies of all time.,10,0,1,13 November 2019
The Dark Knight," Dark Knight Swallows It's Competition
","Arguably the greatest comic book genre film ever made. Christopher Nolan's vision of the Batman/ Joker deathgrip goes back in tone to the two character's first tangle in the pages of Batman no.1 in 1940. Murderous with very little mirth or wisecracking banter Heath Ledger's portrayal of the clown prince of crime is a chilling thing to behold. He brings an uncoiled madness and seriousness to the role that was missing in the more jovial and stylized Jack Nicholson version.
The drawback is that his Joker sucks all the energy out of the room so whenever he's not around or the focal point you're waiting for him to pop up again. Christian Bale's Batman is certainly intense, sometimes comically so while token and unnecessary villain Two Face fades into the background sharing the same space as Ledger's visceral Joker.
That being said the atmospheric grittiness and epic delving into the complex relationship of the two headed snake of hero/ villain is explored to near perfection. It's themes of order and chaos are put forth with thought and expert storytelling. No other superhero movie until that time had tackled its characters so brilliantly.",10,0,1,5 October 2019
Midsommar," Brightly Lit Creepmare!
",First of all I don't blame you for hating this. It's challenging stuff. Surreal and disturbing by the creepy mind that brought us Hereditary. This one moves slower but pulls you into its brightly lit daymare. If you go on the ride it will take you lackadaisically into some disturbing stuff. I chose to take the trip.,8,0,5,22 August 2019
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's First Is A Masterpiece
",This is on a different level. Quentin Tarantino takes the bull by the horns and gives us a visceral punch to the gut in this ensemble piece about a robbery gone wrong. Everyone here is all in and delivers with flying colors and blood and guts.,10,0,0,22 August 2019
Pulp Fiction," A Film Like No Other
",Tarantino delivers a second masterpiece and brings us his unbridled genius in a hail of bullets and humor. Using a cut up method of storytelling comes very easily to Tarantino's quick talking slickster style of moviemaking. One of those films that defined an era.,10,2,3,22 September 2019
Psycho," Slasher Ground Zero
",The granddaddy of all slasher films Hitchcock's Psycho is film at it's highest peak. The story coils around you from the very beginning building your apprehension within the narrative until it suddenly shockingly turns on the viewer and subverts expectations in the smartest cinematic way possible. The fluidity of the storytelling is as good as it gets. This is the Yale of cinematic schooling. A masterpiece often copied but never equaled.,10,2,2,22 October 2019
The Witch," Creepy, Unsmiling and Intense
","The performances are what make this creepy little story worth the watch. Anya Taylor Joy is good as the hapless victim of her family's religious mania. The story unfolds slowly and intensifies as it goes on. Is it real, surreal or unreal? The Witch is well worth the watch.",7,2,3,27 October 2019
Joker," Desolation and Revenge Fuel Joker
",It took two viewings to gather this movie all in. It wasn't until the second time that the tragedy sunk in. Todd Phillip's interpretation of the greatest villain in comic history will haunt you for days after you've watched it. Joaquin Phoenix delves into the abyss to bring you a version of the Joker that is both sad and terrifyingly isolated within the dark forces of his own mind and environment. Everything is a delusion within a reality within a nightmare. Your heart aches to hear him laugh at offbeat moments and at his childlike belief being shattered into madness. Joker in my opinion falls right behind Dark Knight as the best the comic book genre has to offer in movies.,10,2,4,8 October 2019
Man on Fire," Action Packed But No Payoff
","A better than average action flick that falls short on payoff. The ever top tier Denzel Washington as former C.I.A. assassin John Creasy gives this movie 80% of it's weight. Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke and Dakota Fanning all fill in their characters nicely. The big problem is that we never get to know the villain so we are not as invested. It's a good movie but the ending leaves you kind of disappointed",7,0,0,25 October 2019
Downfall," The Most Accurate Portrayal of Hitler Ever Put On Film
","After decades of actors portraying Hitler as either a weasly little fool or a demonic magician Bruno Ganz delivers him as just a man. Monstrous but still just a man. The historical Hitler as he was during his last ten days is played with pinpoint accuracy and humanity, as he expounds on the necessity of killing millions while at the same time showing gentlemanly courtesy to his secretary. A milestone.",9,2,2,22 October 2019
It Chapter Two," What In The Literal Hell Was That?
",I'm not going to spoil the ending but what in the literal hell?! This movie might as well have ended with The it was all a bad dream trope. One of the lamest endings ever and funny how they kept telling you throughout the movie the ending was going to suck. Screw this movie.,6,1,4,18 September 2019
Platoon," Great Oscar Winning War Movie
",Oliver Stone's classic Vietnam war flick may not be as gritty as it once was but it's still edge of your seat stuff. Charlie Sheen plays the new recruit who winds up in the middle of an inter squad squabble that leads him to be tested by his angels and devils. Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger stand out as two sides of the coin that was the Vietnam war. The action is well staged if a bit clean and some of the atrocities caused by soldiers too long in the jungle is harrowing. Still a great watch.,9,3,5,8 November 2019
Halloween," Introducing Michael Myers
","While The Texas Chainsaw Massacre changes the game for a niche horror audience Halloween took the mainstream by storm and also gave us the genres most famous slasher Michael Myers.
Director John Carpenter uses shadow and an implication of a supernatural foe that cannot die to fill the audience with the despair of the futility Laurie Strode (played wonderfully by Jamie Lee Curtis) must feel with each subsequent attack by Myers. A classic...high end indeed.",10,0,0,28 October 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," Trilogy Is A Wrap
",Christopher Nolan wraps up The Dark Knight Trilogy with a film that was flawless until the last half hour or so. While The Joker May have been Batman's most demented nemesis it was Bane that matched him in physical and mental acuity. This is a move where Bruce Wayne completes his arc by coming face to face with pure evil. This would have made a 10 if not for the plot twist that completely destroys Bane as a worthy adversary....,9,0,1,12 October 2019
Tombstone," 'I'll Be Your Huckleberry.'
",The stars align once in a while to make a movie that breaks no new ground with a story we've seen before hit the lottery. Tombstone somehow hits all the marks of the American western and succeeds so completely that you're left gasping at what will happen next even though you already know the story. Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday enters that area where an actor delivers such an iconic performance that almost every movie fan knows his dialogue. Kurt Russell is the embodiment of Wyatt Earp. Incredible.,10,2,3,1 October 2019
Blade Runner," Iconic And Influential
",Claustrophobic and dark Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is as perfect a depiction of the blurring of creator and creation. Harrison Ford as the reluctant Replicant killer Deckard goes from a man who looks into the eyes of the other and learns the nature of consciousness...like God looking upon his creations and realizing that his clay is a separate being. A masterpiece. Rutger Hauer as the lead Replicant Roy Batty is both terrifying and sympathetic.,10,2,3,27 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Looks Great But Horrible Lapses In Story Logic
","Ok so this movie starts off great. Nice visuals, Kyle Ren stops that blaster shot and a very nostalgic introduction to Rey. So we're all set. Then things take a downward turn in logic and the cracks widen the further we get into it. Rey is given an illogical amount of insight into Force power without any answers as to how she's able to do what she does. And don't give me that read the books or supplemental info crap. Movie info should be contained in the cinematic story. Then we get to the Finn character and his sudden amazing prowess on the lightsaber. All this and a craptastic fate for everyone's beloved Han Solo and we have a mild disappointment. That's not to say it isn't fun if you put the whole script lapse on the back burner. JJ Abrams certainly knows how to make a good looking turd however. So turn off your mind, relax and flow downstream in a warm puddle of piss. Beautifully shot and a good cliffhanger too.",7,1,8,14 December 2019
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Introducing Freddy Krueger
",Wes Craven's masterpiece on the blurred lines of the subconscious dream is one of the most effective horror movies ever made. Robert Englund's portrayal of Freddy Kruger is frightening as he lives in the shadow recesses of dreams that manifest in the waking world. Craven's choices of keeping him in shadow were perfect. Heather Langenkamp as his nemesis does a great job here. A classic of the genre.,10,0,0,9 November 2019
The Matrix," Neo Part 1
",Incredibly iconic and influential this movie blew minds back in 99. The Christlike story of Neo was enhanced by what at the time were some of the most amazing special effects up to that time. Ah yes..a time in Hollywood when men and women actually worked together in tandem. Incredible to this day.,10,0,1,31 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Cultural Phenomenon
","Modern commercial science fiction begins here. We all know the cast of characters well.One of the most perfect story arcs regarding the journey of the hero exploded on to the cultural landscape spectacularly. This wasn't just a movie it was myth created before our very eyes. Certainly one of those moments when art, commercial entertainment and the general public come into perfect symmetry. A masterpiece.",10,0,1,13 December 2019
Jackie Brown," Tarantino Slows Down
","Tarantino switches gears for his third outing and takes an almost lackadaisical approach to the characters and story which feel almost improvised. That said this is still high level stuff. DeNiro, Samuel L. Jackson, Pam Grier, Bridget Fonda! What a cast!",8,1,2,22 September 2019
The Bourne Supremacy," Hooray For Bourne The Return
",Though this one doesn't quite reach the heights of The Bourne Identity it's still a high level action spy thriller. Steeped in a universe more realistic than the Bond movies Bourne makes you feel every moment of the tenseness it tries to convey.,7,0,0,18 September 2019
