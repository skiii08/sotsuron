The Legend of Bagger Vance," Bagger Vance is based on the Bhagavad Gita
","Bagger Vance is based on the Bhagavad Gita, which is the teacher of right and wrong and your path to perfection.Bagger Vance is a play on of Bhagavans, meaning the Gods, R Junna is Arjun who was a warrior and Commander in Chief of the Panadava Army. Bagger Vance character depicted Lord Krishna in the battlefield where he gave his teachings and wisdom to Arjun in the Bhagavad Gita.Star Wars was also based on Hindu philosophy and religion. Star Wars was based on the Ramayan. Think about it. Chewbacca was Lord Hanuman, Hans Solo was Lord Ram, Princess Leia was Sita, Darth Vader was Ravan, Yoda was the Guru (Teacher), Luke Skywalker was probably Laxman, etc, etc.Hollywood takes the learning from Hinduism, but doesn't always give it credit. In fact it sometimes tries to destroy the Hindu faith by criticising it and manipulating the facts.Classic example is in the Indiana (Indian) Jones and the Temple of Doom film where the facts are twisted. E.g. the praying to Kali Maa being seen as a negative thing and the depiction of the stones or the Shiva Lingams which represent Lord Shiva. Some Westerners say that the Lingams depict a phallic symbol, which they do not. There is nothing sexual about it at all, except for the fact that Shiva (a male God) was born from the Lingham.So Hollywood.........please get your facts right and portray the correct message to the public and not destroy or tarnish the Hindu wisdom and philosophy. One can learn a great deal from them, which scientists and people are only just discovering. India had this knowledge thousands of years ago. There's no real need to give the Indians and the Hindus credit, but just some respect would be good.Thank you.",10,0,1,22 June 2011
