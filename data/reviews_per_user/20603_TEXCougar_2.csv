The Longest Yard," A Waste of Time
","An unfunny comedy. There were about three jokes and all fell flat.If 'I think he just (prohibited word) himself' is your idea of wit (hey that rhymes with the prohibited word), you will love this show. Otherwise, don't bother.When Adam Sandler, Burt Reynolds, Michael Irvin and Nelly are the start of the show, it's not a good sign.Low expectations, but this movie doesn't even meet low expectations. It is horrible.Fine for USA Network, but charging admission for this poorly written is obscene. Save your money.Better yet, demand a refund. It's that bad.What an embarrassment.",3,4,9,29 May 2005
