Despicable Me 2," Simple and good but expected a little more
","Once again I am not convinced. 'Despicable Me' movie from the series is yet to impress me. Like the first, it was not that good but okayish. The only great advantage of the story was having minions around. As usual the minion's jokes were very good, even in the end credit we're entertained thoroughly. It is unimaginable, 'Despicable Me' without minions.Whatever the movie is, there's no stopping for the Steve Carell role, I mean he as a dubbing artist to the Gru. The story continues after ex- super villain Gru gave up his stealing business to take care of his adopted children. Now he's a trying to be a good care taking father and making jelly for a living. But looks like the past won't let him as a new person. The officials recruit him to catch the new villain on the loose who is a great threat. And the rest of the story tells how they gonna stop the dangerous villain from being executed his masterplan.The story was okay. The problem was the villain, he was too weak. The movie never lets him show his true power in any portion of the tale. I thought many scenes in the movie were wasted for nothing. After okayish first installment I expected this sequel could be a lot better but ended in sadness. This movie is once watchable but not that bad, we can say an average.6.5/10",6,0,0,6 November 2013
Insidious: Chapter 2," A decent follow up with extra flavours
","A satisfying horror sequel from the director of 'Saw'. As a second installment to 'Insidious', it went deeper into the behind story of a character of the movie. Yeah, the first one was told about a boy's special talent astral projection where he can travel to another world in his sleep. I considered that was the movie's advantage but comparing to this, they just implemented the same idea with neglecting the boy. In this movie it describes more about the father's perspective of the story without held back the much required secret for the twist at the end.It opens with a story that set in 1986 where Josh as a kid is haunted by the souls of dead. Soon the story commence on present time where the Lambert family begins to feel again the presence of evil forces in their house. A team of spiritual medium begins their part to expose and free the family from dark forces. I thought the spiritual medium characters Elise and Carl is imitating the dwarf woman and an Indian characters from 'Poltergeist' movie series. I can say director was a clever, he just put away the usual ingredients of the horror genre and added different flavours like time travel and psychology.For adults, most of the horror movies won't scary but watching during night will give more effective. So it a such movie you should try at a dark time for your own advantage to extract from it a better entertainment. I liked the first movie and this one is not far behind with the quality that all horror movie must have. So felt it is a decent follow up with a flashback story.",7,0,0,20 December 2013
The Lobster," Another peculiar dystopian tale set in the future.
","From the director of the Oscars nominated movie 'Dogtooth'. If you are familiar with his signature movie, you will find it so good. This is not the best movie I had seen that set in the future, but like any other it was another dystopian tale. A black comedy-romance with a decent storyline, performances and overall a nice entertainer.The pace was very depressing, but I kept hooked to it for its frequent unpredictable scenes. The first act took place in a hotel which is the introduction to the odd world and the situation where the plot opens. When it moved to the 2nd half, especially after Rachel Weisz come into the frame, the entire scenario changed to atypical romance mode and kept that way till the last with a simple twist in the finale.Colin Ferrell's character was something like the one from the movie 'Her'. But not the same movie, or the theme, except the combination of the genres. It was a good movie, I enjoyed it, but not as much as others say they did. IMPO, it is a one time watch movie for its peculiarness.7/10",7,1,5,24 March 2016
Million Dollar Arm," Two talented boys in one man's dream journey.
","The Hollywood's exploration of India based subjects is continuing. I have been enjoying those. Something quite refreshing which traveling on a new perspective to entertain the world audience. Especially, this movie was not a bigger one like 'Slumdog Millionaire' or 'Life of Pi', but cute emotional family drama like 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel'.It was a biopic-sport-drama about an American sports agent, J. B. Bernstein, who brought two young fastest arm Indians to the States to train as the professional baseball pitchers. Before that, he conducts a reality show called 'Million Dollar Arm' in various Indian locations to find the perfect one. In the end he gets two and takes back them to the country. What follows is the cultural collision where these two finds hard to fit in and perform. With many inspiring lines and tears in our eyes it comes to the conclusion.It was a nice story and inspiring. This movie teaches many things like about family values, sharing culture, hard work for a better future, having faith, true love and all the above the most deserved second chance. It was a predictable story. The minor problem with the movie was it won't explain thoroughly some of the contents it portrays. It is due to cultural different some will have a hard time to figure it out the meaning of it. But for South Asians and Indo-American it will be a perfect movie.The movie had more than sufficient humorous scenes and many of them were in an Indian accent. I had a great time laughing for those comedies. Those comedies are because of the difference pronunciation of the same word between the people of two countries. The character Amit is the center of the attract when it comes to the humour. In the other end, especially in the second half the story drags most of its parts towards the sentiments. I can't say it was unnecessary, but truly was impeccable and touching.''They need to know that you care them''I never knew this director. After checking out his filmography, yeah, I have watched many and liked a couple of his movies, especially 'Lars and the Real Girl'. He did a great job, especially shooting in Indian summer is not an easy task. He himself told in Q&A meet about his struggles. All the actors well cooped. John Hamm's one of the best performances. No doubt he was remarkable.The boys from 'Slumdog Millionaire' and 'Life of Pi' are the two Indian characters. Suraj Sharma as Rinku and Madhur Mittal as Dinesh did justice to the respective roles, though they were not similar kind of face to the real ones like usually filmmakers choose for a biopic. They were really good, did key performances alongside John Hamm's JB character. Lake Bell was a surprised attraction of the movie. I found her kind of cute in some of the scenes than never before. And other major attractions were Alan Akin with his usual incredible show in the small span, and a few others, especially that Indian character called Amit.Even before it was released many had criticised it by saying a TV movie and so 90s. But I had faith in it and watched and it never disappointed me. I have already said in my many reviews that I love tearjerker movies, so it was my perfect one. Some mighty one's are releasing on the same week this movie hitting the screen. I believe this is the only one pure family drama that one could ask for an alternate. In fact best by so far in this summer, according to the family friendly films. I highly recommend it, but all you need is to have a low expectation.",9,41,50,16 May 2014
The Monuments Men," An important aspect of WWII about our earlier history and culture.
","This movie was loosely adapted from the book of the same name which was originally based on the true story of the world war two. It was a war drama with a theme of the treasure hunt directed by our own George Clooney. The movie had multi top stars who team up for a specially assigned task. Just like the Alistair MacLean stories they lead their way to the war zone to accomplish.I don't know how much close to the original story it was, but this movie was a bit slow and drag, all the way dull. But not to forget the story intentionally serves its elements to us without surprises and twists. What we really miss was the scenes that pull us to our seat's edge. Yeah, the fast paced furious thrillers, especially in the last few minutes I was desperate for that and it did come, but did not please me. Even the deaths in the movie were not convinced or appeals strongly. Most of the time I thought it was a dark comedy, especially in the last scene of Jean Dujardin.Other than cinematically transformation fail, I really liked the story. In the real story with real people it would have been a hell of a job than in the movie, which portrays few pieces of the real incident. Heartbreaks to know that many valuables were destroyed during Hitler's invasion of Europe and also makes me happy that these men saved most of it. No doubt, it was a reasonable attempt by George Clooney. Because this story must reach widely to expose these men's bravery and it's only possible through a movie. This is not a must see movie, but for story wise it is.",7,1,3,26 May 2014
Your Name.," They're no strangers, yet they've never met.
","Probably the most anticipated anime since the final film of Mr. Miyazaki. Because people know what these guys are capable of. This is one per cent sci-fi and 99 per cent fantasy. The concept is not new for us. From 'Freaky Friday' to 'The Lake House', even the recent American television film 'The Swap', you will remember a handful of names once you read this film's synopsis. Yet the film was so good, because of how well the theme was utilised.We all know the technical brilliance of '5 Centimeters Per Second' and the beautiful romance from 'The Garden of Words'. This is an excellent mix of those two. If love either of them, or both, then you will love it as well. But if you ask me, my favourite is still 'The Garden of Words' from this director. I liked this film, enjoyed thoroughly, so liking it less than that means not a bad flick. Surely a film to recommend for anime fans, as well as for animation's (western audience).The story of two teenagers, one from the rural Japan mountain region and the other one from Tokyo. The plot revolves around a comet that is to pass by very close to the earth. But before that event, the girl is bored with her life, so she dreams of living in a big city and that too as a boy. One day her wish comes true when she wakes up as she swapped bodies, including most of the memories with a boy from Tokyo.For her, it is to live as she wanted and make use of the opportunity. But for him, it is like a curse, hence becomes rebellious. This thing keeps happening frequently for days and weeks. After some times, realising the phenomena is between two, they make a deal and strict order of Dos and Don'ts while away. All this until the day of comet and everything changes forever. Searching for the truth and the result of it leads to the end of the tale.❝Treasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.❞Unlike Miyazaki, Makot Shinkai's storytelling is quite for the matured audience. It targets adults more than the children. Particularly for not shying away to include naturally occurring events in such situation as the story develops, despite/even though the film revolves around the teens/kids. As for this flick, the concern is not big, but it depends on the nation and its culture you belong to. It is very much acceptable and as the story progress, the best things keep replacing another till the finale. So hooked to it is assured.The film length was good and so the pace of the narration. Well written screenplay, which was based on the book of the same name. But the director admits the inspiration from the previous flicks with similar themes. They have used the real places of the anime version with fictional names, but most of the Tokyo remains same and they all were awesome.In many scenes, the camera panning was a treat. Especially the framerate was high, so no jerks, hence very pleasurable visual experience. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a unique film, despite not a original idea. The film proved the Japan is not overshadowed by Hollywood, particularly after the decline of animes in the recent years. It's up to the quality of the product, if so, then those glory days can be brought back for animes. Anyway, now this film holds the record for highest grossed anime.Apart from technical dominance, the story is also enchanting. If you like romance theme, this will serve you well. A good film for date night. But usually people would skip animation for such occasion and one should not mix up that with anime. Because why I always put apart the anime and animation is, the animes are good at beautiful romance, while its counterpart from the west focus more on comedy and adventure. But the common thing from them is the well explored fantasy theme.Usually the ends are guessable for a film like this and the same case for this in here. Only as a result of the story, you would know what's coming, but not the frame by frame scenes of it. Yeah, I liked this conclusion, the final lines said might bring you tears in your eyes, romantically, if you are an emotional person. One of the best endings, even though it was clichéd. And the credits start to roll up, while you begin to recall everything you just saw in the last 100 minutes. A must see film, so highly recommended by my side. Now I've to wait for another couple of years for such film.8/10",8,2,5,24 April 2017
Captain Phillips," Exceptionally good, Hanks as captain Philllips
","The movie is inspired by the American cargo ship called Maersk Alabama's hijacking that took place in 2009 on the eastern coast of Africa. For many who think it is similar to Danish movie 'A Hijacking' it is not. Both the movies are about Somalian pirates, but a totally different stories which were based on individual true events. One was very much realistic about ransom negotiation and the other one was a clean entertainer on the opposite.Maersk Alabama is the first American ship to be hijacked in over 200 years. Tom Hanks as captain Richard Phillip was brilliant. He continues to give his performances on the variety of roles in his movies compared to any other actors. That is why he's one of the rare actors in all fine movies of his.As a formality the movie begins with the story where the captain Phillips' journey commence from his residence in America. After he flee to Oman to take his ship back to his country, he encounters the threat from a small group of pirates. Once the ship was held by the Somalians pirates the series of incidents occurs before the captain is taken as a hostage in a lifeboat. Then after there's no drama, everything was remarkably shown in those crucial parts with a slightly drag in ending. But the tensions were very well captured and wonderfully exhibited to us.With an excellent direction from the director of the Bourne movie series, this movie came in his another top-notch. The movie had plenty of thrilling scenes takes you to the edge of your seat. One of those segments where I got stunned was when the ship was being held by pirates and when navy approaches to the lifeboat. In those parts I just said, wow!. Now my eyes on Oscar, how many it will gain and lose is I must wait and watch.",9,0,1,25 January 2014
10 Cloverfield Lane," Adds a new perspective to the original film yet it retained the mystery.
","Initially it was called 'The Cellar', but later it became spin-off to 'Cloverfield'. It was a regular type screen narration, unlike the first film as a found footage style. But if you the original film fan, especially monster film fan, you might end in a disappointment. Because it was a psychological-thriller-mystery than the sci-fi-action- adventure.Only the final act determines where and how it actually connects to the Cloverfield universe, yet not very evident other than the clue the title had given and the filmmakers insisted that is indeed from the same franchise. Because I felt, it was very close to other alien invasion films like 'Skyline' and 'Battle LA' or even the latest 'The 5th Wave' than the 'Cloverfield'.I surely enjoyed this film, like an another crazy bunker hideout theme and something which is quite similar to the recent 'Room'. Since they have revealed its association with the 'Cloverfield', I expected different kind which was actually insanely misled everybody. If there won't be a sequel, then the link between the two films are unnecessary, so I'm waiting for that. But still a very good film without those mix-ups. And I recommend you all to consider it as a one-off film in order to have a great watching experience.Another limited cast film with barely a four characters in it and shot in a single location that cost just $15m, but earned in multiple folds. All the credit goes to the marketing tactics to tie it up with the 2008 blockbuster. It would have also done great independently, in the end everybody, including fans and filmmakers are happy for what it is now.The suspense was so good, but it was carried out for too long. The third act picked up its pace like hell which was obviously anticipated since 'Cloverfield' hooked to it. When everybody was thinking of monsters, it is going to delivers differently and that's how the film fairs.7.5/10",8,3,4,24 June 2016
The Finest Hours," A very much acceptable film that inspired by a real event except long pauses and too much ineffective sentiment.
","A disaster drama-thriller based on the true account of the 1952. So much better film than I anticipated. But there are a few things I did not like; like the frequent pauses in the narration where nothing really happens other that space given for the emotional background score to pull the viewers in. In a result, it did not work, definitely not for me. Yeah, in the many important scenes, it froze like it happens in the chess games before anybody move their pawn.In the crucial part of the narration, when the boat was overcrowded, there was an unnecessary pause which annoyed me. It was surely a remarkable segment of the story, but sentimentally failed to appeal or maybe you can call it a too much of the sentiment. Honestly, I liked the story, but the film exceeded its runtime to slow down the portrayal of the event which is surely a drawback than any kind of benefit.I loved the performances, everybody was good and so the CGI, which was not a top notch yet acceptable. Especially as it takes place in the dark time, they had the advantage to depict the atmosphere as much as close to how it would have looked 65 years ago and as well to avoid the errors.I never saw its trailer or the teaser, but I knew about this project and after seeing its posters I though it would be about the offshore oil rig. When I saw the film, I realised I was wrong and surprise do such thing happen in real.The film was also did not let my interest fall. Thanks to the director who always try different genre yet he's not a mega budget filmmaker. A good film, but like I said should have been even better. Especially should have out classed in the sentimental segments. I don't know how good was the digital 3D version of it, but still this regular version is worth to give it a shot.7½/10",8,0,2,4 June 2016
War Dogs," War is like a business zone, anyone can start-up a business.
","Ten years ago a similar film was made with Nicolas Cage in the lead called 'Lord of War'. This was based on the two youngsters who got into arm dealing, but many events were fictionalised. War is a business and these two made lots of profit out of it. So it all begins when financially struggling David clueless about raising his unborn child. At a right time he meets his old friend Efraim and decides to partner with him to supply arms to the US army abroad in a small scale. But when they saw a big opportunity, they decided to give it a try. From the obstacles, they go the extra mile to achieve it. But not knowing how serious the consequences are, finally they step into a dangerous turf and from there, what follows is revealed in the remaining parts.This is really amazing film. Obviously a slow start, but like after 10-15 minutes later it gets better and better. For these actors, this is something big and they have done it excellently. Jonah Hill was simply unbelievable. Kind of good, as well as negative, totally unpredictable character. Mile Teller was superb, he narrated the story with the opening scene, gun pointed at him, the flashback begins. While the story keeps developing, it only gets crazy and crazier. Nearly two long was never been an issue, because of the good pace, as well as for the off beast storyline.Lately I have been seeing lots of Ana de Armas, quite a coincident to watch some many films of someone in a short time. Anyway, her role in this was small, but she was decent. From the director of 'Hangover' trilogy, I think one of his best films it is. If you like the American Dream themes like 'Pain & Gain' and 'Wolf of Wall Street' about making dollars in a fast way risking everything, you would enjoy it as well. Like those two, it was also a comedy, despite inspired by the real. One of the film posters imitates the 'Scareface', but there's a strong reason for that, so you should watch it. Definitely worth a watch, so I suggest it!8/10",8,0,0,14 November 2016
Iron Man 3," This film's success made it one of the finest trilogy among the others.
","It's weird, the movie starts without the opening credits. Soon it begins you will forget everything but the only focus on the movie and the story. Like other two 'Iron Man' I liked this third movie as well but this movie was a little lacked in high-octane action stunts. But still no short for an entertainment.'Iron Man 3' one of a most anticipated movie of the year. I still don't understand this movie and 'Avenvegers' are connected or separate stream stories because Tony behaves like there's one like he suffers from post traumatic stress disorder. Anyway this movie was a bit more dramatised than stunts, it tells his earlier time mistake which creates a deadly enemy for the present. I always wondered such a good actress, Gwyneth Paltrow, appearances in earlier two movies were so wasted. At least she gets some improvise role here, maybe we can expect more from her in the next movie in the series I guess.I totally loved the Ben Kingley's cameo though I easily guessed the twist on his role. More or less this movie's success made 'Iron Man' trilogy to one of a fine trilogy ever. A good movie to watch once, especially if you ever liked 'Iron Man' duology or any other sci-fi- action movies.8/10",8,19,27,10 September 2013
Child 44," A war hero who turned a police officer struggles with his departmental feud.
","It is a strange title. In the narration as well it does not properly reveals, more like an approximate count of something. It is a Russian story, I mean the Russian characters and the locations. It begins after the world war two, in Moscow, a top police officer caught between the departmental politics and a case. After the his investigation ended without a result, the sacked officer gets a lifeline to begin again life in another town. But the trouble follows him when he started to investigate the children's deaths. The result of the case brings the end to the tale with a tiny small twist.The actors were decent, not very impressive. Especially I understand since it was internationally produced, they preferred English language, but I would have liked it in the original language to get best appeal. It was too long film, the first half was very boring. Because it was most unrelated to what comes in the later part of the film. When the narration shifts its base out of the Moscow, that's where it really gets very interesting. So after first 60 minutes, the real story begins.This where the actors got better. Noomi Rapace and Tom Hardy, both were like the kicked off with full of energy. So the second half of the film makes it watchable. Directed by a 'Easy Money' filmmaker who also brought in his Swedish actors to play the smaller roles. It was not good as I expected, but ended well. I don't think it is worth a watch, but who knows what you like. So I neither recommend nor reject it. But it was an average film to me.5/10",5,0,0,4 October 2016
Deepwater Horizon," To remind us our errors and limits.
","It was a surprising film. Because it was based on a real event, but there's nothing much about heroism which is essential for most of this kind of film and its success to inspire the viewers. I liked that. They just wanted to tell the story. Not to create a hero nor a villain. But due to the casting, Mark Wahlberg looks the centre of the story. And also points out a negative character without confirming anything properly. But if the film is depicting the real incident correctly, then it was no man's fault. It should be a technical error that led to the man's push over the limit.It's April 20 2010 about 60 kms away southern coast of the US in the Gulf of Mexico. A new batch arrives to continue drilling in the deep sea as part of oil exploration. When they felt they have got it, but it's only a back foot. Small small errors, following a big blow, the entire crew with the greater effort to stop it ends in vain. Finally, it is a matter of saving their own life than the drilling platform. With lots of action, how one of the biggest man made disaster in the recent time comes to end covered in the remaining part.From the director of 'Lone Survivor' and his part in the project was appreciable. It is another sea disaster theme like the recent 'The Finest Hours'. The film was mainly developed from the articles and also got nominated for the Oscars in two categories, but did not win any. Visual effects were the key for such film and I liked those parts. I appreciate for recreating the event for the world know what really happened. It is a must see, not for entertainment purpose, but it will work for that as well. Recommended!7½/10",8,0,0,14 March 2017
Gravity," It's time to go home!
","'Gravity', one of a best space movie ever produced. Remember I am not comparing it to any space travel and alien themes. Definitely it was this year's 'Life of Pi'. Easily one can put it into his/her's all time favourite list. There are very few breathtaking 3D movies I have seen in my life and it is one of them along side 'Avatar', 'Hugo', 'Life of Pi'. Probably you will miss something great if you miss this movie, especially in digital 3D. You will have whole life with you to see this movie at any time and day but watching it when it is served hot and spicy will be the best shot one can give. So all I can say is don't miss this movie at any cost.Okay lets talk about the movie and its storyline. The story of this movie takes place approximately 600km above the Earth where astronauts sent to repair the Hubble space telescope. During the final spacewalk, Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) on her first space expedition accompanied by Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) gets a warn message from their mission control in Huston. As that destroyed Russian satellite's scattered fragments are approaching them at very speed. Soon after they loose contact from the control station in the Earth, now they have to abort the mission and reach the safe place. But it is too late for them and what comes after is the chain reaction of the destructed Russian satellite.Sandra Bullock was very good as well looked so hot in off the astronaut costume. There are no running, dancing or any gun fights like that happen in space travel theme. As it is happening in the space everything are floating and drifting so within that limited offer to give an actor to perform she did a wonderful performance. George Clooney did not have much scope for his role, within his limited time span he was as usual very nice.It won't waste much time, within starting few minutes the visuals makes you to feel you are in the space. Since it takes place in space, we know the objects floats in zero gravity so there are many visual pop-ups. Most importantly the intense pop-ups are excluded like that happens in commercial movies, everything are looked very natural like that happens in the space. It was a great achievement cinematic, to show the enormous space with most of them covered with dark background in 3D other than Earth's. Yes, with a dark background it is hard to see the depth of an object in 3D so the graphic designers did a wonderful job to make it work. In some of the scenes the camera view transforming into a character's view which were something I never seen before, surprisingly awesome.It was a simple storied movie but a breathtaking stunts, we were expecting all these years for it without knowing. A little late but came at the right time when the graphics and 3D are beginning to boom the cinema world. As you see it was not a rocket science to understand the movie but of course it was a bit about rockets and stuffs. What I am saying is anyone can easily understand the movie, it was not that complicated at all. Even kids can enjoy it, only if they are okay with loneliness, distress kinda mild mind tortures.This year's Oscar buzz begins with this movie, what a way to begin. I will be very sad if this movie won't get at least a single golden trophy in an upcoming Oscar ceremony. I think I can expect nominations in the category of visual effects, cinematography and best female lead for Sandra Bullock. As well there is a strong chance that this movie could get into the top 10 for the best motion picture nominee list. But still I don't how everything goes in the next couple of months because there are many great movies are in queue to hit the screen. Such Oscar movies are '12 years of Slave' and 'American Hustle'. I got a feeling that its big box office will impact a lot at the American Academy Awards. If everything I said happens, on that particular night I will have a little smile remembering this review I wrote.As you see I might be a bit overwhelmed by a watch but I am sure this will be the best 90 minutes you will ever spend time for a movie in 2013. To encounter the real space atmosphere you must see the movie on a big screen as well in digital 3D. Hope you will enjoy it more than I did or anyone around you.9½/10",10,2,5,13 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Show no mercy while hunting or it may hunt you back
","'Lone Survivor' tells the true story of a US navy SEAL team and their failed mission called Operation Red Wings during the Afghanistan war. As the title says there's nothing to hide or secrets behind characters, only one survive from a team of four soldiers. How it all going to happen unfolded in an unbelievable manner.It was Mark Wahlberg's show, though Taylor Kitsch, Eric Bana and others appearance gave strong grip to the story. This movie takes place mainly in three locations, one from US navy base, two from mountain range and the third one from a small village. The US navy base was okay, but the mountain range and Afghan village were looked clearly fake. Failed to recreate those middle-east atmospheres where the movie was shot (in Mexico), but the movie was breathtaking by the story and performances make you forget the technical side flaws.In a few areas, it makes you to feel it was overdone. Especially after soldiers were wounded by multiple bullet shots. But then it was clearly explained in the opening scene itself like the soldiers were trained to stand tall in any given harsh situations. The director of 'The Kingdom' crafted this movie awesomely in a similar fashion to that. One of the Oscars talked movie, but did not do well, though got good responds from the movie goers around the world. It is like this year's 'Zero Dark Thrity' based on US war against Talibans. Knowing truth is always good for knowledge and if it comes through a movie, then it will be a thrilling entertainment.",8,0,2,1 April 2014
Train to Busan," Horror express.
","A week ago I saw a zombie film from Japan called 'I Am a Hero' and now this Korean. I have not seen a quality zombie film at the recent time. The second tier films like 'Cooties', 'Freaks of Nature', 'Scouts Guide...', all these were comedies. Probably 'World War Z' was the last decent zombie film I have seen and after that this is the one. So the timing of the film was another advantage. Since there's no competition, this zombie film rules. And not to forget the Korean style, they are among the best thriller film makers today.Directed by an Anime filmmaker, this is his first live-action film. When I decided to watch it, I thought it would be another Korean film, which rely on father-daughter sentiments. You know I kind of tired of that Korean clichÃ© where at the final stage they let the kid sob and call it a twist. Initially I enjoyed those and later on getting bored of that. With that kind of reasons, I would have missed it. Being a film fanatic, I won't mind to risk a watch, except give up writing a review for it.But in this case, it was completely different. Even the characters, any characters in the film, either in the lead or the supporting ones, all are unpredictable. That's the biggest plus point of the film. At the end you won't be sure, who you were rooting for. You know in those edgy scenes, we blindly back the one we like. You will think you can guess the upcoming scenes, but the writing was very smartly done. Feels like they did not care about a sequel, if this meets a greater success. But who knows, this is a cinema and there were many mysteries kept unsolved, so they can pick up from one of those loops.'Whatever you do, you must finish what you start. It's worse than not doing it at all.'This is the story of a divorced, workaholic father and his young daughter. After the progress, many others join them. On her birthday, they decide to visit her mother in Busan. On their train, soon after it took off, they come to know that something is wrong around. With all the chaos unrolling rapidly, a group of survivours gathers in a car since there's no escape as they are trapped in a moving train. How their journey ends, whether they reach a safe place with the fight against the living dead, the narration comes to halt.In the contest of good versus evil, there's no place for sentiments. But at one stage, near the end they cleared the place to attach one. In that final scene you can't resist, even if you are not an emotional person when it comes to the film. As I mentioned earlier that is the part I feared the most would come, but i did not hate it in the context of story development. Because that was a perfect setting to take the story to the next level. There are several twists. Those are from the film characters' perspective than the story wise. They did not bother to tell about the cause of the epidemic. Instead, this film was focused on the train passengers and their fight for survival when the defending options are limited. Just imagine it is a zombie version of another Korean film 'Snowpiercer' or like 'Snakes on a Plane'.I have heard there's another film, an animation which is also directed by the same filmmaker and said to be a prequel to this one. If you had liked it, you would be itching to watch that one as well. Hope I would watch it as soon as I get an opportunity. So, my view on it, the film is very good. It was close to two hours long, but once the train journey begins, you won't going to notice the time. I am saying the pace of the film, as well as the events make you dissolve in it completely and forget everything else. This is the best zombie film right now and you should not miss it, especially if you like this theme. Recommended!8/10",8,4,9,24 January 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The episode III½.
","So this is like a bridge between the original trilogy and the next three prequels. A story where the main characters from the original tale are not involved. Being a big fan of this franchise, I loved it. I did not expect big, so got entertained well. But pity that this wonderful characters are not going to return. This is just a one-off film. For seeing its overwhelming success, there could be a prequel, which has a very very slim chance.The story was like that had started in a half way. That's why I wanted a prequel to tell us the Galen Erso's point of view story. When he has been taken back to the base to work for the Empire, his daughter is the only one who escapes from there. After a few years later the grown- up daughter, Jyn, end up on the rebel's side. When she hints a plan for them to strike the Empire, nobody considers it. But a rogue gang forms where they all does according to her saying. That's the story, and how it all ends are the rest.The story was simple, but the action-adventures were good. Like what a 'Star Wars' fans want to see. The main drawback was there's no familiar faces around. Even the original franchise style of title and credit presentation was off the beat. Though there were cameos. Darth Vade, Princess Leia, R2D2 and 3PO, including a small lightsabre fight at the end, just to satisfy the fanboys. Overall a worthy film, otherwise it would have not earned one billion at the box office, making one of the top 10 of all time.8/10",8,2,7,24 October 2017
This Is the End," Ridiculously hilarious and totally enjoyable
","This movie came as a surprise package, totally enjoyable, ridiculously hilarious and I thoroughly entertained. It stars all the new gen rising stars especially the actors from comedy stream. Seth Rogen, Jay, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride and many others are just awesome. But I thought Channing Tatum's cameo was a bit foolish and others come for couple of frames. Could you believe it Seth Rogen directed this movie, well he did a hell of a job in the first movie.Pretty acceptable graphics for a fantasy movie, but sometimes it was dirty and sexual. The story centers around the Hollywood celebrities who meet at a party thrown by James Franco and soon after everything turns hell when the beginning of the end roll out. A bunch of celebrities trapped in a house preparing for the apocalypse and doing everything they could to protect each others.The filmmaker superbly used the theme songs and movie songs especially the Backstreet Boys' song during the end of the movie for a dance like 'Slumdog Millionaire'. So far it was one of a fine comedy of the year which was based on the short video. Loved it, hope you will do same as well. Recommended.8/10",8,2,8,19 September 2013
Passengers," A space-travel tale!
","I was going to watch it, but not expecting it to be a masterpiece. It was not, yet surprised to be a lot better film when it comes to todays film overcrowded with space themes. The entire story takes place on a spaceship. It's a space journey tale, when the mankind with 5,000 on-board heading for a new home planet, but one of them unexpectedly wakes up from his hibernation pod. It's supposed to wake him and everybody a few months before their destination, so now he's up nearly a century early, and what he plans to do is what the adventures covered in the rest of the film.There's no connection to the 2008 film of the same name. Initially I thought it was like a live-action version of 'Wall-E'. Not entirely, only a few scenes and the main two characters remind Wall-E and Eva. It is also a limited cast film and I loved the simple screenplay, but strong enough to be one of the best in its kind. The actors were very good. The visuals were beautiful, a perfect film for the late night to watch alone peacefully.From the Norwegian director of 'Headhunters' fame. This is not his Hollywood debut, but previously he had got an Oscar nomination for the film 'The Imitation Game'. The concept was like 'The Blue Lagoon' or kind of the space version of the Eden Garden tale. I had predicted a few scenes, those were too simple to do that. The real big thing came in the later part, especially when all the focus shifts to more than the initial narration. Scientifically, not everything believable, but cinematically, anything can be possible. So with a such concept, the film headed to the conclusion where a twist came into play. Entertainment is guaranteed. One of the year's best that should not be missed. Recommended!8/10",8,4,6,4 August 2017
Zootopia," Try everything (but differently). So Disney has done it again.
","This beautiful animation came to exist because of coming together of the directors of 'Tangled' and 'Wreck-it-Ralp'. It is Disney who had once again done it, since their rival Pixer is going down in a rapid speed. As a Disney fan since my childhood, I'm very happy for their success in live-shot films and animations, especially for this one.Okay, since the revolution of 3D animation over 20 years ago after overthrowing the 2D animation, most of the big productions like Disney, Pixer and Dreamworks with few others never failed to deliver. Believe me, I was not interested in this film when I first saw the teaser and trailer. But they have done great promotions and so the film did awesomely at screens worldwide. I was totally blown away after seeing it, Disney's another unique universal charactered story. From the little children to the grown ups, everybody definitely going to enjoy it.All kinds of animals coming together happens only in cinemas, and that too mostly in animations. But todays kids are very sharp who ask lots of questions, so they had a fine explanation for the doubts regarding putting animals in a same society. It was like the United States, where everyone came from different continents and represents different race. And so in this film every animal came from different land to live together peacefully in a city called Zootopia.So the story begins when Judy the rabbit follows her dream to become a police officer in Zootopia. There she meets Nick the fox, who are actually arch-rival species in the wild, but it was thousands of years ago before adapting the civilisation. So trust is what not promised between them, but they're forced to work together after a small missing person case becomes their prime agenda. Solving the mystery is what brings the end to this wonderful tale.These days animations are not just concentrated on comedies, trying to get us emotionally as well. Maybe that's how they're grabbing the adult audience, especially the families. Shakira's cameo was the highlight, and her song 'Try Everything' helped the get attention from all the corners.The Oscars was concluded just a couple of months ago, but it already feels like the fever is gripping again for the next edition and looks like this film is leading the way for the animation category. I know it's too early, but I hope it wins it. And finally a request for the Disney, bring it on a sequel as soon as possible.8/10",8,7,14,4 June 2016
42," His game plan was simple, being himself
","42, the jersey number of a famous American sports person, Jackie Robinson. I never heard of his name before because the baseball is an alien sport in my country. Yes it was a wonderful biopic of an Afro-American baseball player who made a stepping stone to the future of his race with the baseball game.This movie tells the story of Jackie Robinson as young and how he made into a famous team 'Brooklyn dodgers' to play for the American baseball league. The story sets during 40s just a few years after the II world war end where Branch Rickey, a baseball team administrator played by Harrison Ford, by his bold idea he recruit a first Negro player to his team to play.I am smell the best supporting actor award for Harrison Ford, still a long way to go for that. This movie was kinda similar to Clint Eastwood's 'Invictus' where racism was the mainstream story. An inspiring story of a man who overcame to become an American hero. This is something that everyone must see, maybe because of moral of the story. An highly recommended.9/10",9,0,1,13 August 2013
Green Room," There's only one way out and it is to fight back!
","From the director of 'Blue Ruin', yet another crime-thriller. This time it revolves around a rock band who trapped in the neo-nazi enclosure on the outskirt of the city. So how do they plan to get away from the green room they're locked in, and armed men are outside waiting for them to take down. The film filled with lots of tense moments and mostly unpredictable stuffs which is a one day event.I was not surprised, I just expected something as smart as the director's previous film. He retained his favourite actor, Macon Blair to play an important role as their third collaboration in this multistarrer and he once again did well. This theme is not the first time explored, it is a well known, but the setting was very unique. All the actors were amazing, but truly very sad to hear the news about Anton Yelchin. He was a young and a wonderful actor and his '5 to 7' was my favourite.At first, I thought the plot was so silly. I wondered why they did not use the excessive force as they're capable to tackle such situation. But that's the best part, because they threw away the cliché and approached for something new way to deal it. So the writer, I mean the director did great to carve a rare and thrilling film of the year.There's no martial arts, criminal gang's collision or the cops fighting the bad guys; it was about how the normal people confront during a hostile situation in the real world. Blue and Green are done, now I'm waiting for the director to announce his next colour project.7/10",7,0,3,14 July 2016
The Danish Girl," An important biopic, but not inspiring.
","Before this film hitting the screens, I remember many experts were expecting it doing well at the Oscars. Now it's got 4 Oscar nods, even though it is very sad the movie is a hit and miss. A slipped away opportunity, had a great storyline, but the outcome was decent. An important historical biopic, at least for a certain section of the audience. I respect that, but it did not impress me as I anticipated.From the Academy Award winning director for the movie 'The King's Speech', and the last year's winner for a lead role, Eddie Reddmayne together did not deliver the expected masterpiece. But Alicia Vikander was so good, another brilliant co-female-star display just like Felicity Jones from Eddie's previous movie 'The Theory of Everything'. If I were a jury I would definitely give the supporting actress award to her, that's the result I'm hoping for in the next Sunday.The actor did a hard work for the title role, in the many scenes he mastered it, but that's where I slightly disappointed. I felt his character was a little intense, maybe I'm not getting him because I'm straight. The locations, costumes, even the direction and music were good. Both the lead actors kind looks alike, no doubt on the casting, but it only should have been a bit better in exhibiting story.Maybe the pace should have been a little quicker as well as some sentimentally appealing scenes would have done good. I desperate to give more marks, but I can't go beyond this. I won't consider it a bad flick, what I meant was a missed opportunity to be a masterpiece. So overall, it is a good watch.7/10",7,0,1,24 February 2016
Little Boy," Wars are the scars in the human history.
","I was two minded after seeing its trailer. Because I'm pretty much convinced it is a B movie. But that's not the issue, I usually put my faith on them and take my chances. So what bothered me was the film contents, because the trailed roughly reveals what kind of movie it is, from that I reckoned it should have been a big production house's product. Hence, I believed the visuals could be disastrous, but that was not the case. In fact, it was a remarkable standard, one of the reasons for the movie's success, despite there are no list-A actors in the full fledged roles.The boy was much better in the movie than I judged his performance in the trailer. He might have appeared in a few television episodes, but this was his silver-screen debut. A wonderful display and I believe he would bag more projects for this. It was a family film, an emotional drama set during the United States entry into the World War II. Takes place in a small western coastal town called O'Hare about a 7 year old boy Pepper, nicknamed Little Boy who's willing to do anything to bring back his father alive from the war. On the effort he takes up a series of task which later stuns his town and the whole country.'Do you believe you can do this?'The Fascinating thing was, the blend between the real occurrence with the fictitious attachment. People might believe it was based on the real, but it is not. Like I said the graphics were very crucial that matched to any big budget films, unfortunately it was a small portion, but definitely a big deal. It talks about lots of interesting stuff which is inspiring, partially funny and also a children friendly film. Especially it explains quite clearly the difference between religious beliefs and magics which is obviously little kids never understood. So it could help to learn something from other than the textbooks.The plus points were the consequences of war (any war), how the people can get affected by the war, bullying, racism and misbelief. On the other hand the minus was too much ingredient in a little movie, fortunately clicked so well. As usual, it was knocked down by the critics who never recognised the art of sentimental works. If you are not one of them or their followers, you are going to enjoy it.If it had some big names in the main cast, especially for the father and brother characters, then it would have been roared louder and helped the international markets. As being one of the finest storied movie that highlighted our past mistakes, sadly terribly failed at the box office, but very much could get a cult status because particularly families loved this one so far. Not highly, but simply I recommend it and one of the must see from year 2015.8/10",8,1,2,4 November 2015
Point Break," Most deserved remake, but relying on CGI for everything ruined it.
","This movie is only about stunts, the story wise, it's a great disappointment. I have seen the old version, for a 90s movie, the actions were fantastic with an awesome story. In this remake I don't know where's the story, the characters were underdeveloped and it rushed towards the end with plenty of high octane action sequences everywhere. This formula won't work all the time like '300' and 'Fury Road', but it's really good for watching in digital 3D.The story was kind of sameness, but slightly altered, especially about that 8 ordeal and stunts were obviously freshly designed. The graphic works were weak in some parts, it failed to give a natured effect. Yeah, I think CGI is the issue, the movie relied on it for everything.The cast performances were fine, but a big star in the lead might have given a different result. It's entertaining, but that was not enough these days, especially for a cop movie we expect details, not just physical tricks. IMO its a one time watch movie, or better try the original.6/10",6,1,3,4 April 2016
Creed," CREED is the new ROCKY.
","Honestly, I was looking for the 7th film in the 'Rocky' series, so this spin off was totally unexpected. But it is the right thing since the Rocky Balboa is getting old. Besides, in this reboot era, keeping franchise alive and leaping into the next generation was a very smart move. By doing this, they're keeping the original series fans with them to back it. I hope this will only get going like the Bond movies, since the young star, Jordan has another 30+ year potential to continue the 'Rocky' legacy by delivering some hits in his belt.I don't know how they have done it, just kept everything so simple yet delivered a successful movie. The director of 'Fruitvale Station' and its actor Jordan's second successive run. I wish the combo return for the third time for another grand scale flick. Of course Stallone's presence made a big difference, but the way his character was portrayed, I feel the next film will get more emotional, especially between Rocky and Adonis like Rocky and Micky. And I'm also hoping for a bit better romantic tale on the side.I grew up watching 'Rocky' movies, so I wanted badly it to be at least a decent, but it is a fantastic flick and I definitely suggest for those people like me. The youngsters as well can taste the new beginning in the Rocky legacy. CREED is the new ROCKY. The blueprint for the screenplay was exactly same as the original movies, even the music was very comparable yet everything was updated to the current timeline. Now I'm looking for a follow-up in the next 3 years.8/10",8,1,4,24 February 2016
Spotlight," Uncovering the sins committed by whom the millions of people believe in.
","A documentary film would show the real faces of those offenders to shame them. That's the reason I desperately wanted it to be a documentary, then I would have definitely given a maximum mark. There's no complaint about this movie, but adaptation means fakes acting, fake settings and awards goes to non real achievers. Anyway, this movie kind looked a semi documentary and liked the way it was made.The movie exposed a very important scandal. If something is open for a debate in the US means, the rest of the world would follow the same route. That's where this theme was inspired by. It all begins with a group of journalists from the Boston Globe with their new editor instruct them to research on sexual abuse of children by priests. So their lead only gets bigger and puts them to recover more evidence in order to publish. How they come up with the story that shake up not only the nation, but the entire world is the remaining.A collection of bunch fine performances. There's no lead actors in this. Everyone is in the supporting roles. Out of 6, it got nominated both male and female in the category of supporting role for the Academy Awards. I am very disappointed, Mark Ruffalo's performance in 'Infinitely Polar Bear' deserved another nominee. Anyway, this 15 year old story still looks a hot topic. It was a great comeback for the director after critics assaulted him with their words for his previous film 'The Cobbler' only to show their rage on Sandler. It is a must-must see. Beware, is is not your weekend entertainer, but based on the real.8/10",8,0,1,24 February 2016
Concussion," At first in the past, all good things in the world were always denied.
","Based on the real life story of a Nigerian forensic pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu who discovered CTE disorder that most of the American football players are suffering from. So he fought for his theory against the NFL who was denying it. I was neutral when #OscarsSoWhite broke out, but for this movie I definitely agree on that. Whether he would have won or not, Will Smith name should have been in the best male actor in the lead list.That's not at all, this movie did not qualify for any other category in the event which is not unfortunate, but deliberately the Academy chose a wrong side to stand. Felt like they are supporting NFL instead of fact and its own product. This biographical movie talked mainly about one particular sport, maybe there are other sports in the globe that might cause CTE as must as this one. Since Dr. Omalu's research came from NFL players, so it was all about between them.This is a wonderful movie, I was very surprised for it. In the past, every good thing in the world was always opposed in its beginning, but later accepted widely like the global warming. I hope people aware of such thing is exist and act accordingly. No need to abandon the sport, just change the rules and the style of play. This is one of the best movie you could find from the 2015. I think it is a must see biopic, the credit must go to Ridley Scott who is the man behind for this movie to happen.9/10",9,1,3,24 March 2016
Don Jon," It is about a modern day's way of cheating
","I was thinking the first century of the third millennium where the meaning of cinemas is rewrote. There's been lots of chances we can see and one of those were the beginning of adult-comedies. Recently 'Ted' made lots of waves among movie goers. So here comes the another one from the actor of '50/50' who also debuted as director. Making first is always challenging one, not many had tasted success but he handled very nicely his crew as well the co stars. It was a nice script based on today's world and the path the youngsters moving.The story centers around a character Jon who lives by his own principles. He does everything like every other guy like watching porn and masturbating. One day he meets his girl and begin to give his full commitment to it. Sometime he has to break his rules to obtain from opposite, so the remaining portions explains how far he would go and sacrifice his life for a girl.Definitely it tells the unexpected truth to the older guys who are troubling to understand present technology that affecting people in a strange way. I was talking about online porns and this movie deals about the same theme. The trouble maker in a serious relationship, we can call it a new way of cheating. I believe this movie is not for everyone, if you are okay with adult theme as a comedy then it will be fine. I can call it a rare movie about online porn video addiction.",7,0,3,3 January 2014
Youth," The youthfulness ever presence, despite the living matter nears to cease.
","Half a year ago the first look poster of this movie's stirred everyone including myself. Not seen such kind of posters for even movies like 'Blue is the Warmest colour' and 'Nymphomaniac I & II'. It is obvious the director of the Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA winner for the movie 'The Great Beauty' delivered another similar ordinary concept about extraordinary fictional personalities. And the way of their life, especially when they meet the difficulties at some point of their lives.From all, the casting of Michael Caine caught my interest on this. This is another wonderful movie with the hard work of the fine cast and the crew. There is a good chance for the movie in the upcoming Oscar and other prestigious awards node in a couple of categories, including for the Caine's performance. Because it looks like made for awards, rather breaking records at the box office.Whatever the topic of the movie is, 'love' stands at the centre of the web. Human affections for each others, losing someone you love and at a same time falling for another. All about passing through 'love' in the life and in which, how strong is our grip on it to carry along with us to the end of the life was illustrated pretty compelling way.The theme was bold, and everything shown was realistic. But it also makes some illusions to brief the other side of reality. For instance, a Buddhist monk who demonstrates his peaceful achievement, a fat man kicking a tennis ball high in the air et cetera, all these are the youthfulness of who are no more youths, citing as a desire for beyond their limits which is obviously what the title implies.I won't expect everyone like the movie as I did, because it is not made for everyone. But you could try it and then decide your thought on this film. That is one of the way the movies like this can work for the people who are choosy sometimes.8/10",8,2,4,4 December 2015
The Hateful Eight," ...And then there were none.
","I'm neither Tarantino nor Nolan's fan, but love watching their movies. As usual these director's films are highly expected by all, that's including me. This one started off quite like a normal western, so I thought it wouldn't be like the director's previous film 'Django Unchained'. In fact, it was considered for a sequel to that, but the director felt this story and the previous character Django failed to blend, hence 'The Hateful Eight' was born with Samuel L. Jackson playing an important role.Solid eight from me for this QT's eighth film. But I felt the movie was kind of inspired by 'And Then There Were None'. It was not about to find who's the killer or next to be killed. The character introductions were at its best and an excellent twist in the middle. This sets in a cabin with eight strangers struck there after the snowstorm. But after an unexpected event the suspicious started to mount and brings chaos. Then takes us to the flashback to reveal something the story that did not mention in the earlier part which's very essential for coming back to the finale.The 80% of the movie was just talking, but the remaining stunt sequences were so powerful. All the eight, plus, supporting character were exceptional, but the director's favourite Samuel L. Jackson nailed it as his character is a bit above from the rest. The entire film was shot is a couple of locations, but the major portion takes place in a cabin and it was a limited cast movie. These days, western movies are shrinking, only a very-very few good movies are made every year. In the time of superheroes, a movie like this is really very precious, so definitely recommend it.8/10",8,1,3,24 March 2016
Moana," Girl finds out the true identity of her people.
","Okay, I shocked when I heard this film did not get the Oscars nod, except for a song. Now I have seen the film and I come to know why. This is a one liner, but developed into a longer version Except the initial parts, this film is like a limited cast/character film. Most of the film takes place in the sea sailing around fighting evil force to break the curse. But at the end, you would feel this kind of story is not worth for a feature film. It looks a perfect short animation theme.Disney never disappoints its fans, well, for me. So I enjoyed it, it was fun and entertaining, but too simple. The characters were cute, this is a wonderful film for kids and some grownups would too enjoy it. But this is not for all, unlike most of the Disney animations are. Dwayne's voice lending for one of the lead characters was good, but the girl steals the show. Especially if you are a kid and/or a girl.The best film since 'Lilo & Stitch' on the similar theme about Pacific islands' people. But it reminded me 'Whale Rider'. Overall, I think the story should have been improved a bit, in particular by including a few more characters at least for the partial appearances. This is not the best animation of the year, also definitely the bad one to skip. If your purpose of the watch is entertainment/timepass, it is good at that.6½/10",7,0,6,24 February 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Young & hungry to fight crimes!
","No doubt, Tobey Maguire Spider-man is the best. It was also the first modern superhero of the millennium. The visual effects and entertainment wise, the second live-action Spider-man was good too, but this one is so different. This is about a teenage superhero. Just a kid. Having possessed such superpower, how he manages it alongside his normal life was nicely told.This story begins straight away, because the introduction was done in the previous Marvel film, which are part of Avengers universe. Peter Parker assisted by Tony Stark, is very keen to fight small crimes compared to what Avengers fighting for. He feels, he's held back by Iron Man, so he wanted to make independent decisions. At one stage he succeeds in that, but things get more severe. Fighting bad guys, and the other side of his life, a romance, how the remaining story turns out are revealed with a twist.Tom Holland was good. The story was simple, more like one liner. But the visuals and each scene forged nicely. Having seen all the five previous Spider-man films, this was quite predictable. Particularly the characters and their connections. Seeing how it had ended, it is possible that the daughter of the villain could take-over her father's place. That would be very interesting, because of the linkage between the film characters.After seeing the first look, I was afraid that this young Spider-man might be overshadowed by Iron Man, but those parts really well done. Comparing it with the 15 years ago Spider-man, the technology has been the biggest change. That's why I still love Tobey Maguire film. Very simple and down to the earth without cell phones, computers. But the current superhero films are all alien oriented/connected theme, and of course digital technology a big leap. Hoping the next film too would impress us with the same intensity. So lets wait for summer 2019.7/10",7,0,0,24 December 2017
Fast & Furious 6," The 'Fast & Furious' franchise getting better and better
","I think it's getting better and better after 'Fast Five', since the introduction of Dwayne Johnson into the franchise. After stylish 'Tokyo Drift' I loved very much this and one before it from the series. There were not many movie series that pulled the franchise from average to awesome like this one did so the credit goes to the writers and director as well as the actors.As expected finally the action babe arrived, Gina Carano. After seeing her in 'Haywire' I thought she would be next Lara Croft. I mean the next big action lady, the one after Angelina Jolie but not as I expected role though okay. There was a death of one of a main character in the movie, I kinda doubt that because of surprise re-entry of Michelle Rodriguez into the series.It was a well written script, engaging characters except one scene where Dwayne Johnson and another actor who make a British man go stripped. The movie missed having some nice action sequences from the Dwayne Johnson a little let down from that perspective. But the rest of the stunts were breathtaking. Who cares whether it is graphic are real I just enjoyed especially the final one with the aircraft which long lasts for over 20 minutes. I guess there won't be that long runway anywhere in the world :p. The movie will be more enjoyable by hardcore action movie fans so why don't you try if you have not seen yet.7.5/10",8,12,22,16 November 2013
The Book Thief," An inspiring movie to boost reading habit among the kids
","This movie did not look like any fictional tale, but was very realistic, that happened back in the 40s. It was based on a book of the same name. The filmmakers given soul to the movie with a great adaptation. This children's movie was awesome to watch if you are a fan of this genre. It was set in the backdrop of world war two in Germany, which chronicles a 8 year old girl's life during those times.The movies based on world wars are always interested either it was fictional or real. There are not many war movies which tell from the perspective of German's especially their citizens who are forced to do many unbelievable stuffs. This movie was pure drama which tells only a family's struggle over the rule of the Nazis. The performances were hypnotised me a lot. The old man role, Hans was played by the great Geoffrey Rush and the little girl, both of them were the highlight of the movie. In fact, one of the Geoffrey Rush's best movies I have seen, I went speechless for his acting in the movie. The girl was also so good in fact she was the backbone of the movie. Except those two, few other characters were shown in brilliant shades such as Max, Rosa and Rudy.I don't know why this movie did not qualify in many categories for the 2014 Oscar. A fine movie specially made for events like this by the Unknown filmmaker for many of us. It is a must see in my opinion, in the end everything is left to the audience and their movie tastes.9.5/10",10,1,4,4 March 2014
Suicide Squad," They are not superheroes, they are supervillains.
","It's nothing against DC, but overall I'm starting to think the todays cinema is getting crowded with the lots of superheroes. Just like any pollution or the over population on the earth's surface. It needs stability, but nobody cares about it other than money making agenda. I also think it's going to last for only a few more years, when this trend going to end like that happened in the 70s, 80s and the 90s. And the space travel era to begin which is already kick- started. So DC or Marvel and others, they should be careful, for far they could take their products.Like the title say, it's not just about the film characters, the film itself a suicidal. I'm not saying the film was unnecessary, but the plot was dragged too much. There are too many pauses, or you can call time wasting moments. I could not take another blowing up city concept. And that swirling thing in the sky, I don't know how long they are going to use it in the superhero films. I did not like the supernatural concept which is supposed to be a pure science fiction action adventure. At least Thor was from another planet, more like he's an alien, but the witch in this film, ruined my appetite.The actors were not bad and so the graphics, including the stunt sequences. The story was very familiar. It was more or less, same as the animated flick 'Monsters vs Aliens'. It can be watched for entertainment purpose, the majority won't say it's their favourite or one of the best of the year. But surely there are people who would love it. It was a massive box office hit and I don't see any hurdle for its sequel, but all I hope is it to get better in the follow-up. So finally, it's not a bad film or boring, but it just did not have the midas touch that all the superhero films had. That means a watchable film, only for once.5/10",5,1,2,14 December 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Time to have the sidekicks.
","The second movie in the series directed by Russo brothers. This time the story set in the modern world only if you are not taking 'The Avengers' in the account. The cast was expanded, I mean the sidekicks were introduced. Looked the strength of the 'good' has doubled, but the villain was also equally good. The first praising words goes the directors for handling it well and hope they are going to repeat the same magic for the next movie as well.This story commence just after 'The Avengers'. Captain America and Black Widow are sent to free hostages and collect some data. Soon after the Shield director Fury is targeted by an assassin called Winter Soldier. After this incident the weight leans on Captain America, he becomes the prime suspect. With the help of Black Widow and a new wingman called Falcon, he seeks the truth. Unexpectedly the story strikes with a twist and exposes the man behind it. Once everything revealed the tension arise between good and bad before it ends with a convincing solution.''Before we get started, does anyone want to get out?''The escape scene of Samuel L. Jackson was awesome and I wanted it a little longer. The new addition, Falcon was another brilliant, just like the sidekick Robin from the Batman world. The story was okay, but the excellent performances and visual narration were the movie's strength. The 3D effects were better than I expected. In a few scenes I thought the villain Winter Soldier was better than the Captain America. He was a surprise package, if you just ignore the antagonist tag he can surely be your favorite from this movie. Even I liked his costume and he also performed some great stunts.One thing I fascinated about this production house's movie are the post-credit scenes. Yeah, this movie had one too, but that particular scene created lots of curiosity. A good movie and will definitely pass the test being a follow-up either after 'The Avengers' or to 'The First Avenger'. Again Marvel did a wonder job. Just keep those coming, and it will be well backed by the audience if it is worth. The good days are just began for sci-fi and superhero themes. I think I said it every time during Marvel's movie reviews. One last reminder for all that don't miss any marvel's movies because the stories and characters are connected each other since the 'The Avengers' made a debut.",7,0,1,12 August 2014
Life of Pi," 227 days of Pi's life drifting on the blue desert
","Well, one of most expected movie of 2012 by me. It was not a colorful visual movie like 'Avatar' which was bluish Or 'Hugo' which was orangish except in few scenes that too come in night shot though IMO you should not compare it with above two. Many part of 3D sequences were just awesome.It could have been more violent and sentimental story that ever told on this theme but not, the director cleverly blended the humor with character emotions very nicely, thats why it was just ratted PG where children are allowed with their parents approval, but it is common for them to see an animal to kill another in Animal Planet, so its not a big deal i think. The CGI animal(s) were looked so clean and good.I must say the movie don't offer what you expect from its trailer, in movie it was totally different than any movie in the world except Waterworld + Cast Away + Castle in the Sky = Life Of Pi, i am not comparing it to other 3 but saying got similarity in some parts.I did not like the end much, I mean the way it ended was not proper, I thought it still had something to go far away then realized it happen only in commercial movies.My question is can this movie do good business which got no big names and cast!? Indian cast, Taiwan's talent, American product and a great effort of various technicians from around the world is equal to LIFE OF PI in Pacific ocean over 227 days. Hoping it gonna grab couple of awards in Academy award. Worth watching it in 3D, Someday in future you can say that i was in there when it came out when it called epic like what we call some of classical movies today.You could see better and beautiful India in beginning few Minutes than any Hollywood movie which deal on Indian subject. people from in and around Pondicherry can feel proud, why not whole Indians can. The images from the movie will remain in our eyes for some time even after you left the cinema hall specially may be you won't forget the name Richard Parker.And now i go for 9 outa 10 saying must see specially we Indian coz we cant make movie like this at least for right now in our own but we can watch this western piece of Indian art carved Ang Lee.There is a chance it gonna replace 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' as his (Ang Lee's) best, i said may be so lets see. Might be i am little excited for seeing it in preview show lets see what happens later days and what others say.9½/10",9,14,25,22 November 2012
Doctor Strange," When a science person was the chosen one in the spiritual world!
","You would have not expected it from this director if you had seen his previous films. This was based on the Marvel comics that I haven't touched. So basically I had high expectation to witness another side of Marvel universe with another set of (super)heroes. And surprisingly, it was very entertaining, nothing like other Marvel's heroes/story, except the possession of superpower to fight evil forces.Firstly, Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead in a Marvel film, I did not think it would work. All I knew is he was a great sidekick, but that image has changed here. He was wonderful, definitely I'll be looking forward to its sequel as they had confirmed at the end. The theme wise, it is similar to most of the superhero tales, but some new concepts were added to it, I mean the superpower and that's what made it so unique.Just like 'Thor', this film as well had taken the spiritual believes only for the basic platform. The rest of the developments are the clear mix of fantasy (illusion) and science. So it means the film is for theists and atheists. I am one of those who did not like 'Inception', which I think an ordinary action film with multiple layers. But this one was so awesome and it is for the people like me who think 'Inception' failed.Visually spectacular. I regret missing it out in digital 3D. Its Academy Awards nominee in the category of Best VFX tells the story. There will be a tough contest, even I'm up for 'Jungle Book', but I won't be sad if this wins. The success story of Marvel continues. Not everybody reads comic books, but film goers are the majority. So adaptations like this are people like me. Let them keep coming, I love this format better. This film is not just for the youngsters, but old, families, as well as kids can enjoy, so I hope you won't miss it.8/10",8,2,2,24 February 2017
Interstellar," True to the science and a few fictions, artistic yet entertains.
","Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers.As we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.It was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.The first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.There are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.''This world's a treasure, but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.''All the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the screen space in the story presentation. The fine performances from Anne Hathaway and Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was also great and was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.Anyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.I could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science- fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film.''Maybe we've spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory.''The visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.The end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.",9,0,5,12 November 2014
Pacific Rim," The Flesh Giants vs. The Iron Giants
","I had many reasons to watch it, one, I was a huge fan of 'Godzilla' movie, saw it when I was a kid and being speechless for many days. Two, Guillermo Del Toro. Three, I always eager to watch a good visual effect movie on big screen, so I am graphic geek.The story follows when giant monsters known as Kaiju rises from beneath the Pacific ocean, the war between human and them commences. Initially millions of humans lose their lives in the series of Kaiju attacks. To fight those monsters humans creates monsters like giant robots called Jaegers. This makes the war between them fair enough to compete each others and balanced until the monsters started to gain the fighting power back from the humans. So the years pass the apocalypse nears, the humans need to stand and fight one final time to defend the Earth and what happen next were the grand finale.I feel deja vu now, wait, I have seen before these giant robots somewhere before. It took more than a moment to figure it out. In my childhood I saw them in the television cartoon show, Duckstales but I don't know what they are called. Those were kinda similar to these giants.When 'Transformers' and 'Godzilla' comes together it forms 'Pacific Rim'. A $220 million movie which made lots of buzz on movie goers, including me. Wondered what was he (Guillermo Del Toro) planing all this year since 'The Golden Army' which released a half decade ago. The more gap between the movies, the expectation grows higher and I was just curious to see this movie than thinking how it could be. Even I had set countdown in my phone for this day (12-07-2013) since last 60 days. Finally the day came, as a movie freak I wanted to see it in IMAX, since there is no IMAX around me I had no choice but go for regular silver screen digital 3D version.Does it worth seeing in digital 3D? is the million dollar question from the people who are looking forward to see this movie. I say definitely worth it, what is the use to see an advanced technique and a CGI graphic movie in the regular version. Movies like these are meant to see in digital 3D because it is not some comedy or sentimental drama but a huge action pact movie. Don't expect pop-ups, that's for amateurs who are new to experience the 3D illusions. It was shot in regular 2D then converted to digital 3D so it was better but not so awesome.The movie had not serious big names in the cast. There is no one particularly to say who done great work but they all performed their best. The Japanese girl Rinko Kikuchi was kinda cute, as the movie was inspired from Japanese monster tales she added the Japanese flavour to the movie. Ron Perlman was good, expected little more screen space for him. Charlie Hunnman and Idris Elba, they both were okay especially Charlie Day has been so nice just like he was in 'Horrible Bosses'. Looks like he's a new sensation in comedy World, hope a great future ahead of him.Geographically speaking I am happy that this whole movie won't take place in the United States itself after all it was theirs movie. Hollywood has a Worldwide fan base so when they make movie from outside the regular geographical stream the audience from the rest of the World will always welcome it.It was not the best movie nor the worst that I have seen in this monsoon. For a $220 million movie the graphics were so awesome, the action and stunts were breathtaking but by far the story was so weak especially the character developments. Whenever you see Kaiju and Jaeger on the screen it will be the thrilling experiences but other than that the development happening around the human characters were little boring I mean it was emotionless. When it compared to 'Godzilla', 'Godzilla' was well balanced between them two while in 'Pacific Rim' it was one sided and that is all about graphic, actions and 3D. These modern movie techniques carried the whole movie with their shoulder and made to look better. I can say these special effects were the highlight of the movie.Like my synopsis say it was decent till the end then confuses with few common logic. If you just ignore it, the movie will give you the best entertainment that you have paid for. If you are looking for a good story, twist and characters then it is not the right choice, this movie was totally an action packed with awesome graphics. This movie will more suitable for younger audiences.",8,2,6,12 July 2013
Lion," Lost in India, found in Australia!
","Based on the book 'A Long Way Home' that tells the story of a young Indian boy who lost his brother in a railway station in the night and the next morning he woke up thousands kilometers away from home. Not knowing the language or the address and the names of his family, he struggled from various threats in the society. After that he got adopted from an Australian family and the rest of the film revolved on his true identity. Haunted by his past, how he rediscovered his originality was emotionally told.Very impressive film. The families should not miss it. Even though it is a must see by all ages. I am not a big fan of Dev's performances, even in his debut film 'Slumdog Millionaire'. After that success, he had survived in the film industry doing decent roles, for like a decade. But it was 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' that changed his career. For the first time I liked him very much in that, and again he was pretty impressive in this. The second best performance in his career. Though his part comes only after the half way mark. Yet in that one hour, he did great, particularly in the sentiments.I was wondering why it was called 'Lion'. And I got answered only just before the end credit. So you should be patient to learn why, if you are yet to see it. It was not until the 90s the India began to see a real change. This story takes place in the mid 80s, only the opening half and those parts were raw and cruel, especially in the eyes of an 8 year old boy. That kid was so good. Just like Jacom Tremblay, a year before who impressed us with his performance from the film 'Room'.It was a feature film debut for the director and he was wonderful in this attempt. The film splits into two, the first half was about lost and the following half is about finding the road back to the home. Less dialogues, but well written in those necessary parts. The music was good. Only negative was the film was out of depth. Yeah, all the events were like fast forward. If they had focused on details, the narration would have reached at least 3 hours. Especially I wanted the Australian mother's perspective on how she went through to raise those kids.Now I'm waiting for the 2020. I mean 2008 was SDM, 2012 was LoP and 2016 was this one. The 4 years later, surely there will be another India related western film would come. Despite this film nominated for the 6 Oscars, it had won nothing. That's very sad. Overall, I strongly suggest it. One of the best films of the Year. 9/10",9,0,0,24 June 2017
The Lost City of Z," He wasn't the first, but came close to let the world know his founds.
","I don't know what were the people expecting from it, another 'Indian Jones'? Booby traps, man eating ants, ancient alien ship et cetera? Well, I agree it was slow and boring in parts, but most importantly, it was only revealed the true story. Not all the biopics are delightful entertainer. Originally this tale took place for three decades, but what you saw on the screen was merely a highlight. All about the adventures. The personal life was less focused. Especially the final act was honest. Because it is a mystery. So people should appreciate for the effort from the filmmakers.I really enjoyed it. A film like this hard to come by. I mean when a film based on a real person was made a film, people expect the only heroic act, instead of truth. That kind of mindset need to be changed in order to enjoy it. Or else pick the those similar commercial films instead of it. Charlie Hunnam was impressive, probably his film best I've seen so far. He always reminds me Tom Hardy for having a similar facial. There were others in the film, but only he had piloted it.It's weird that it should have been a British film, but Hollywood made it. Above all, the funny thing was they correctly pronounced the Z as Zed. Anyway, that's how the real story was. The jungle scenes were awesome. In many parts it was very suspense like when they had contact with the Amazonia tribes. I was very curious about what would happen. Because all I remember was 'The Green Inferno'. Those who are interested in the history and archaeological expedition, this film would be the right choice, but anticipate reality, not something out of the world.7/10",7,0,0,24 September 2017
Ant-Man," Size doesn't matter if he's a superhero who committed to save the world.
","My confession is I never read 'Ant-man' comics and I never knew such kind of superhero even exist in Marvel till this movie was announced. (But I know Danish film 'Antboy'.) So I'm glad they brought cinematic version of 'Ant-man' and I'm sure he'll return to the next 'Avengers' as they promoted strongly in this film itself to know what would be the audience response. I don't know others, but I definitely welcome the idea.Another CGI magic, another Marvel's wonder. As long as they pick the right cast and crew with a good story, the sci-fi like this continues to rule the cinema world. It was a great team work, that must be appreciated. As usual the top notch visuals as well the performances, even the sidekicks. But I was surprised to see when Paul Rudd was attached to this project. I believed it would be a comedy sci-fi packed with full of action, and I was wrong. It was a simple tale, a heist theme and of course it was fun to watch, but never was a comedy movie.A wonderful beginning, especially for the first film in the series. You know strong foundation is the key to raise a building above. I know the sequels would only get better by progressing and it should be. Because in all the Marvel's superhero flicks, this one was the most family and young kids friendly. That does not mean there were no violence, but from the title to the characters and presentation, all were so casual and can be understood by all.It was so great to see a legend like Michael Douglas to be a part in the modern movie. Now I am eager to see Evangeline Lily as Wasp-girl in the follow-up. It would be like Peter Pan and Tinker Bell, but in a sci-fi version. The extras were very interesting, I enjoyed them as well. If you're are yet to see the film, don't expect anything like Disney's 'Honey' trilogy, after all, if you enjoy the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) then you would do same for it which is the twelfth to follow.7.5/10",8,2,5,14 December 2015
American Hustle," Yet another fine crime-drama based on the real events
","Yet another crime movie based on real events like recent 'Pain & Gain'. It was the star's collision, everyone competed with each others. Giants like Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper and Jeremy Renner fought to show their masculine strength. In another stream Amy Adams and new sensation Jennifer Lawrence had war to rule feminine parts. Overall, it is the celebration time for movie buffs to see multi stars in one screen.As usual Bale's appearance did not surprise me. He's one of the actors from Hollywood who do a variety of experimental roles in his movies especially in physical appearances. Bradley Cooper had a good time recently with many blockbusters, so in a movie to share screenspace with Bale will boost his professional growth in his career graph.Amy Adams is a good actress, but she's not attracted to me though she was great in this film. No doubt Jennifer Lawrence was thrown an incredible performance with her small role. Yet both are very enjoyable to watch, especially expected that particular cat fight moment.Let me tell why you should not miss this movie. The cast was the great strength the movie had. Robert De Niro's guest appearance made it more fuzz and the puzzling story created lots of guess games among viewers. I must say it was well scripted by the writers and crafted beautifully by the director of 'Three Kings'.",9,0,3,4 March 2014
Rush," I saw the best ever Hemsworth
","Ron Howard, the master of biographical picture maker. As I know of him, he never failed to transform biographical stories into a movie. In fact, many of his movies are my favourites. This time he picked up a true story of two rivalry formula 1 drivers from the 70s. This biographical sports drama was nothing short in all the aspects compared to his earlier movies. So his legacy continues with a series of masterpieces in his filmography. I am always fond of his works because the mix of sentiments in his movies is powerfully appealing just like I wanted. The emotion tool was very wisely utilized in this movie as well.The races from the movie were shot awesomely with the old automobile models and sets around. It was a perfect direction utilizing this inspiring true story with two great actors. It won't only tells about races but also the inexplicable friendship between them, which is hard to predict as we are not they. As per my observation I did not detect any flaws, especially races were exceptionally shot, totally top- notch. From the fast pace story narration due to the fine editing to background score and visual effects, we must recognize the A1 quality of the production house.This movie portrays about the 1976 Formula 1 season where two new comer drivers from Europe, James Hunt and Niki Lauda are considered the top rivalries to grab the world championship title. So their's stunning entry from lower class race to the big event, the clash between them were exhibited very well. Two equally great drivers with different mantras in their life as well implement in the race track was just mind blowing. The story was told from the perspective of both of them where narration frequently switches.Initially I was not favour to give it a shot. The reason behind it was the Chris Hemsworth, I am not a big fan of his performance. Most of his movies are commercially feel good kind ones so I was a bit hesitated to put my faith in this. And a couple of Ron Howard's last movies as well not like I expected but was just good. This movie completely reformed these two guys and redefined their's capability once again. Regretting for not saw it earlier, but feels good that I did not miss it after all. A highly recommended movie, which was one of the best sports movie from 2013 along with '42'.9.5/10",10,2,2,13 January 2014
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," A fun film, but also very sensible.
","The title clearly says it is a parody of 'Justin Bieber: Never Say Never'. I haven't seen that, but this film was so fun. Just like another 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story'. If you like the combination of music and comedy, this is for you. I think the writing was the best thing, even the lyrics of the songs. The directors did their part very well, but in the end it was the actors who saved the film. Andy Samberg was splendid.The film was narrated in a documentary style like a series of interviews which also includes behind scenes, I mean unedited clips like the live recording. It is the story of three members of a famous band in America. When everything was going well for them, the split happens unexpectedly. So the main singer decides to go solo and sees some success. But he struggles through his girlfriend and their marriage plans, and also he finds some issue with his manager. You know the makeover begins, how he comes back to his normal life was the remaining film.It is not anybody's biography, but you should still watch it. The storytelling is not preoccupied with the drugs and sexes, though there are some amounts, which makes it is good viewing for the adults. Don't think it is some silly comedy, lots of things from it makes sense. You can enjoy the music and at a time you would have some laughs. Well balanced contents and overall it is a rare comedy.7/10",7,0,1,24 September 2016
Baby Driver," Don't mess with this Baby!
","One of the stylish film of the year. There's nothing special about the story, but the way it was made looks intriguing. The individual characters, music, stunts, obviously car chases. Not the best role Ansel Elgort has ever played, but in his short, beginning of the career, it quite possibly defines he's ready for the tough roles. Then the British filmmaker known for some wonderful action-comedies, one more addition to his hit kit.A youngster who is a getaway car driver for heists, working under a criminal mastermind, is often teamed with a different crew. One of his latest job takes an unexpected twist, leaving his yet to bloom romance with a waitress in peril. His attempt to come out of that, the risk he takes, changes his life forever. The tale ends with an action packed finale.This is the first Kevin Spacey film I'm seeing after all the allegation against him. I blame everyone equally who had let him do it all these years. But that's nothing to do with this film. He was fine as an actor as always. It's just fine to be as one-off film, but the way everything had happened looked like it could have been a great franchise. As of latest news, it is on. The sad part is, all the good characters won't return. Anyway, it is one of the must see from the year T17.8/10",8,0,2,4 January 2018
Man of Steel," The first time I liked superman for its grand presentation
","Superman was never been my kinda superhero. I think the first time I liked him because of this grand presentation which commercially feels good. The old one was more drama kinda movie than the heavy stunts. Compared to 70s superman, this movie had computer technology with it to make every impossible things to possible and that was the highlight of 'Man of Steel'.Like I said it was a heavy graphic movie and I loved it to the core. Tell me if you are a graphic geek then how could you not like Zack Snyder's movies, ahh?. The stunts and all were the massive. I knew Henry Cavill can pull this movie but the surprise was Michael Shannoni. He was the best villain I have seen in any Superman movie, a backbone to 'Man of Steel's success. Others like Amy Adams, Russell Crowe and Diane Lane's supported very well.This reboot was dumped deep details of the superman from the old movie. They retained only main storyline and went straight to the 'Superman II'. Hope the its sequel will tell us the superman's job at the press company and affair with Lois Lane. I eager to see the clash of Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck in Zack Snyder's 'Batman vs Superman'.8/10",8,2,5,26 October 2013
The Revenant," The one who came back from the dead to avenge.
","The movie was inspired by the real event that sets in the year 1823, United States. When one of the crew members of the hunters left behind after he was severely hurt from a bear attack, he desperately looks for a way to get back to the camp alive, especially to avenge for the death of his close one. The whole film was about survival in the wilderness and to avoid the native Americans. But the introduction in the opening was very brief and in the final act, it was another brief man hunt. Overall, it was an enjoyable movie for adults with some gruesome scenes.The movie was made on a grand scale. Well written screenplay, good direction, the cast, music and the locations, but it would have been even awesome if it was true to the original occurrence. I felt it was cinematically overdosed, especially for the commercial purpose. The fans of Leonardo Dicaprio's overwhelming celebration created a huge buzz. In fact, it looks like the entire Hollywood is his fan and the Oscars given to him out of sympathy, because I have seen his best performances better than this in the past.The length of the movie was a big concern, should have been at least 15 minutes shorter. But the visuals were fantastic, the CGI bear was almost flawless. There are plenty of reasons why this should not be missed, at a time the narration lacks the realism. Otherwise, it would have made a wonderful semi-documentary film. So don't have high hope on this, especially if you're no ones fans, but just love watching movies like me. A little bit overrated everywhere, but still this movie is good, just good, that's it, not a masterpiece.7/10",7,1,3,4 May 2016
Bridge of Spies," Totally unexpected PG-13 rated negotiation-drama based on the Cold War.
","The movie that should have been made 50 years ago, but due to the international political tension it did not take off. So now it's here, the same director made it. It's a rocking combo, once again Spielberg and Hanks come together, tell me who's going to miss that. Simply spellbinding, one of the best movie of the year.I think this flick is for adults. There's no sex, no nudity, not even a single kiss or the bad language and zero violence, its fine for teens and kids can understand, but the story is what I meant that suits only for the grown ups. Like the usual, this Spielberg movie is easy to follow, there's no tricky twists and turns, but aimed for only the event that's based on the real.Over a 2 hour long negotiation drama with surrounded by suspense and thrills. It's completely a one man show and the end has been just like everybody wanted. I'm not surprised that it is nominated for the Oscars in the 6 categories including the best motion picture. I would be very happy if it puts at least a couple of trophies to its basket. I feel it is a must see if you're interested in WWII related subjects, other than the war.8½/10",9,2,4,14 February 2016
Split," The 24th's about to explode!
","The much needed break for the director Shyamalan. It has been over a decade since the last time he was lauded like this for his work. On the paper, it was a simple split personality disaster theme, but cinematically clicked so well. Firstly the performance of James McAvoy made this film a very success. I have seen his lots of films, but if I had to choose only one of his great, that's would be easily this one. A straightforward story, no complication to understand, or needed to explain everything it revolves. Then suddenly the final act turned into a different mode. With a twist, all comes to end.The three teenage girls have been kidnapped at the beginning. Following that, the victims do not know the situation, but makes a couple of bad moves, except one girl. As the film progress, many secrets revealed to us, particularly about the kidnapper. It all developed to lead in one direction where an unimaginable thing going to happen. How and what result it brings told in the following parts.The perspective of the story was not really a thing in this. That means it does not take sides, but gives you the option to choose. And most of the viewers would root for the weird girl. It was Anya, and she's having a wonderful career in early stage. Could becomes one of the best if she contributed all her performances in the same pace and intensity. The music was equally awesome. Created the perfect atmosphere along with the visuals. I could have not asked the better one. Best thriller of the year. You will be stupid to miss it out if you love films.8/10",8,0,3,4 August 2017
We're the Millers," Millers versus the killers
","Surprised adventure-comedy of the year. 'We're the Millers' tells about a fake family who are trying to smuggle the drugs from Mexico to United states. David is a single who is a drug distributor in small scale. One day his boss makes a deal with him after he was robbed by the street boys that he must bring a huge shipment from across the border. So he makes a team with the struggling stripper, homeless girl and abandoned boy as a fake family called Millers. The rest of the movie was full of fun adventures on the road.A simple predictable concept with the potential theme to make the movie at its best. How could no one ever thought this kinda story before. The movie was nothing special except the unique lead four characters. Each performance was good, individually they all gave the life to the movie. Surprised to see 43 year-old Jennifer Aniston as a stripper. It might be about a family's road adventure but not suitable for the family audience especially the kids.One of the best road movie in the form of unusual movie characters but same old adventures and comedy. Some of the scenes were nice which really brings the wide laughs out from us. The story might deal about the smuggling drug but in the presentation you will witness that no one consumes it. Yeah, kinda weird way a movie to get a rating R other than semi nude from the Aniston. A cool comedy, I recommend it for its rare and originality concept.7.5/10",8,0,1,9 November 2013
The Lego Movie," Frankly, I never expected it would be this much awesome.
","3D animation is a new thing in the cinema world. Just the two decades old technology, which started with 'Toy Story'. So as it is young, filmmakers utilizing it very awesomely to create great stuffs. So far we had seen the many wonders of classical tales such as 'Tangled', 'Frozen' et cetera, as well based on the modern subjects like, 'Cars', 'Turbo' et cetera. Here it comes one more movie that specially made referring gaming object like the recent one 'Wreck-It-Ralp'.I loved 'Wreck-It-Ralp', but the fact is that I was not in favour of this movie. Expected it gonna bomb at the box office, then surprised me with the result and made very curious. I knew characters in the form of Lego bricks are easy to animate, we can say just like the stop-motion animation, but it won't give smooth pleasurable flow. That truly bothered me over this movie. Once I began to watch within a few minutes I got adjusted with it so comfortable and enjoyed completely.The story of an ordinary construction worker, Emmet and his unexpected journey towards saving the world. He was accompanied by the great fighters and warriors and superheroes. He has to find the secret plan of villainous leader who controls the land of Lego and must defeat him. To know that you must watch the movie.It is a nice movie, though the story is not fresh. Kind of spoof which imitates recent past movies like 'The Lord of the Rings', Chris Nolan's Batman movie and many others. Especially all the famous characters from various movies had the cameos. It was so fun having them together in one place. So it is not the story, but the way of story telling was so innovative and modern and that showed this movie to the gate of success.I remember I had the best time building something with these Lego bricks in my childhood. All those memories came alive after watching this just like I remembered during 'Wreck-It-Ralp'. It is such a cute movie with fun characters. A smart movie for all age group. I am very much sure it will be one the strongest contender for the next edition of the Oscar ceremony. At present I am not seeing any other equally good ones so who know it may win, but have to wait for another 6 months to know that.",8,0,1,17 June 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," If 'The Machinist' for Christian Bale then 'Dallas Buyers Club' for Matthew McConaughey
","Day by day, movie by movie he's getting better and better. Who? Matthew McConaughey. I thought 'The Lincoln Lawyer' was his best, but then 'Mud' came and I was shocked about his performance. Now even better in this movie, in fact the best from all of them. The first thing popped out in my mind was the Christian Bale's 'The Machinist'. Because of his weight reduce for the role in the movie was phenomenal. In this movie as well McConaughey did same homework for a movie character and it was just awesome.You can ask anybody who saw the movie will say McConaughey's performance was astonishing. But you know what I surprised in the movie other than him, Jared Leto. You will gonna observe his next best performance in here only after 'Mr. Nobody'. Yeah, I was shocked by his appearance, he totally had the movie along with McConaughey.The movie was based on the real story about a person from the 80s who had HIV+. The movie briefs his struggle to survive against the dangerous disease as well fight against the law. The story was very good, it says 'no matter what, you never give up'. How far would you go to fight in order to survive when law and medicine failed its duty along with losing your best buddies. It was just like the other perspective of story to 'Puncture' where a man fights to prevent spreading this same disease.If 'The Machinist' for Christian Bale then 'Dallas Buyers Club' for Matthew McConaughey. He nailed it, the character was totally looked like from the state of Texas and none others would have done like him. Definitely one of the front runners for Oscar in the best actor category. This great performance will be a biggest breakthrough in his career for sure. And that makes he's in watch-out list from now on.",9,2,2,7 February 2014
Now You See Me," Very clever but not intellectual yet entertaining
","The story was commercially very strong and these guys really pulled it together who are not actually the top league actors (big buck giants), except Morgan Freeman. It was also Mark Ruffalo's one of a major role in his career and did nice work. Woody Harrelson also supported very well with young and rising actors like Jesse Eisenberga, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco.Like I said vast cast and diverse with layers, anything could be happen and anyone could be the end twist. The movie was kinda similar to 2012s 'Red Lights' about exposing the secrets of psychic and magic tricks. Here Morgan Freeman as the chaser and four young magicians called 'four horsemen' are being targeted by him. After theirs first and second show they instantly become national talkative. Along with illusion exposer, the FBI joins them who are after them for their bank heists during the performances.Kinda cool, very thrilling and entertaining, like a cat mouse-chase. The magics are not really magic that we expect them normally, but very modern and fictional tricks that specially made for cinematic. So don't expect any sense or logic, it has been just major commercial element used as the movie theme, that's all. I enjoyed the movie a lot. If you see the movie poster you will know that where 'The Illusionist' meet 'Ocean's Eleven'. One of 2013s fine commercial entertainer and it can be watched once.8/10",8,0,2,21 October 2013
Captain America: Civil War," The heroes're divided and so the fans!
","Before watching this I thought what the Avengers are doing here. I believed they got the title wrong. Once I watched it, I'm still the same. Because it did not look like the Captain America's film, he never was dominated, so calling it as his film totally inappropriate. Technically, it is a third Avengers film and well done. I liked it, it was entertaining. But the Civil War means it's nothing a nation's war within, just these super-guys fight for themselves against what kind of administration they want to come under.I think they have heard that people's complaint about blowing up the buildings during reviewing other films by bringing up this one. So they finger pointed those events in this narration and that is one of the reasons for the Civil War to take place. Particularly disturbing the public and loss of many lives when these powerful men fighting the bad guys. The fun part is they are off the street and had a most important confrontation of the film in a deserted airfield. So does it make people who were whining about that be happy?I don't know, but as an entertaining film, it did everything it can give the best for the viewers. Like the title and posters reveal, the heroes are divided here and probably you're going to take a side. Like usual, I'm with the Stark. So if you're like me, then you would feel the annoyance with the opposite team, particularly like Antman and obviously Captain America's rebellious decision. It was like the world versus United States, because only Americans are behind Captain America. Anyway, I did not like dividing the fans and what this film has been a serious damage. I hope the fans won't take it seriously.8/10",8,3,7,24 September 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Well, everything's in the title itself, you watch it only to confirm.
","I don't want to be so negative like the film critics, but this is a big disappointment for me watching being a film fanatic. I don't think anyone who loved 'Harry Potter' film series would thumb this new beginning. This is not like 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit' from the same universe, but different trilogies. I was excited for something like that, as a concept wise, for the fresh tale from from the fresh characters in the same universe. I don't know about the book version, but the film did not click for me.It had a bunch of nice characters, and to set in the Harry Potter universe, really it should have been a masterpiece. The major drawback was the story. There's nothing to appreciate the screenplay. It's about some creatures from the magical world got out in the human world, just like 'Jumanji'. So our hero struggles to recapture them. Meanwhile, some others too involved in and the reason will be revealed in the final stage.Nice casting and great visuals. I won't point out its director's fault, because he has done his duty very well. He's also will be the man behind the rest of the sequels. I think it deserved the Oscars for the costume design. Not a bad film, particularly for the kids. Comparing it with the Harry Potter franchise makes it a worst film, but independently it is an okay film. So the initiation was average, but I'm still expecting the follow ups to be much better.5/10",5,1,1,14 April 2017
The Conjuring 2," This time a London family struggle in their haunted house.
","First of all, I am not a big fan of the first film, but I liked that. Now this sequel was not bad either. This time it takes us to the London. But the film reminded me the 80s film 'Poltergeist', particularly the second part. So don't assume it is exactly the same, only the scenes involving house seems similar, but the story was different. It is another true story based film, that's what they said in the opening statement. You're not forced to believe that, if you're here for an entertainment, you will get that if you put your logics away for the two hours.A family of four young children and their mother living in a house in the London witness some serious paranormal activities lately. Particularly the eleven year old girl affected the most with the spirit the house possessed. So the American couple from the first film are brought in to do their best to help the family. When they try to contact the spirit, they won't get what they were looking for. Instead, an unexpected blame goes for the girl and soon the family loses confidence in them. The overcoming those misunderstanding, particularly realising the truth brings a twist before concluding the tale.The one twenty minute never looked too long. Because there's always something keeps happening, so the audience to keep engaged with. Probably this is won't be your best horror film of the years, but being a horror themed film, it had good form of those contents. Not too scary, at a time those clichés were used in a good way to bring freshness in the scenes. I will credit the writers for that. Besides, the actors were undoubtedly good, including those little ones. For me this is a better horror film and I definitely look for another sequel. I hope this one would stand up to your expectations.7.5/10",7,1,2,24 September 2016
Jackie," The four day episodes after the tragic event!
","An unusual biographical film. I have seen films about JFK, either based on the real or just fiction, but this one was entirely focused on his wife. It sets in just weeks after his assassination and soon goes back to that day and the following to tell us how Jacie Kennedy handled the bad time. From tragic event to conducting the final rites, that four days she has to fight for the right decisions. All these revealed by her to a reporter in one of the following week. Remember this film was originally meant for an HBO mini-series and then they turned it into a feature film. That was the risk taken by the filmmakers, later it paid off well.I never knew who was Jackie, so when I saw Portman's performance in the opening stage, I thought she was overdoing it, the accent and imitation. But after some progress in the story, I got used to it thinking that's how it would be. Yeah, she was excellent and she deserved that Oscars nomination. I wondered what was the source, but after the research I came to know that it was based on the magazine interview by the same reporter you would see in the film. The Chilean director's Hollywood debute. He has done a good job. Also one of the final films of John Hurt in which he was in a small role. Worth a watch for it is being unique and especially revealing some unknown truth behind and/or after death of JFK.7/10",7,0,0,14 June 2017
M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," We know him as Dhoni, but this is the tale of Mahi.
","Usually Indian film fans are divided according to the regions. Because if you turn any corner in that country, there's another film industry, another English alphabet replaced to rhyme with Hollywood. They have got their own bunch of actors, filmmakers and films. They might be divided over films and film productions, but they always united when it comes to cricket.Remember one and a half decade ago an Indian film about the same sport made into the Oscars, but did not win. This film was based on the life of one of the greatest Indian and world cricket player. So length into breadth of the India, it was a highly anticipated sport- biographical film. India has a long history of cricket. It was brought into the country by the British nearly half a millennium ago. It is called a gentlemen's game, which means only rich and royal people can play.So in India, cricket was always been a game highly influenced in big cities. Players from those places are high in demand till recently. Talents from second and third tier cities never been noticed. But some player made it because of political and other sort of influence. That's changed forever when Mehendra Singh Dhoni's success inspired millions of people. Made youngsters to take bat and ball believing someday they can play for their state or in the national team.If you are an Indian, I'm sure you had heard many things about him, his difficult path to stardom. There's nothing much difference in the life journeys of his and Shivaji Rao Gaekwad. They both were ticket sellers/collectors. Struggled through to initiate their profession, but in a different field. Now they're superstars.In Indian films, it's only recently the trend had started in biopics. For a cricketer, it is an ideal initiation. Remember Sachin Tendulkar's documentary film is due to release in this summer, but it is an international project. It can't be neglected because of his hardcore fans, not just in India, but across the world. He had retired a while ago, but still fans chant his name during the recent games.I know this director, since one of his films was remade as 'Someone Like You'. Bollywood films are always very stylish, but slips away while depicting realism of India, Indian society and culture. That's where I lost interest in them. I watched it for MS, since he plays/played for my team CSK who is known as Thala.Seems funny, some of the lines that translated into Tamil. But culture wise, it is understandable. A boy was born on the 7th of July '81, but soon the narration shifts focus on his childhood in the late 80s. A fine football goalkeeper, but changed his sport after an unexpected offer. Extremely interested in batting, but his opportunity was being a wicket keeper.When he enters his teenage, he had learnt to play his own method. Particularly in batting which is the least given privilege to him by his coach. Supportive parents, but from above that, the great friends gang, he had with him at all the good and bad times. The first half is all about the cricket. In fact the whole film was about him and the cricket, the rest of his life was not concentrated enough. I mean on other stuffs, except the romance that takes off during the beginning of the second half. So basically that's where you will come to know this guy is a man with feelings and emotions like you and me.We all knew him as a cricketer, a great cricketer to say. Since his romance parts come into play, for a brief moment the sport was set aside. A love story kick starts. All those who believed he's a superhuman, will come to realise after witnessing Bollywood style of romance, which is basically how happens in real India. He's not an emotion showing type, especially in public or during the game. But there's a scene in the film and when it appears, that's really heartbreaks. No offense, but it looked Sakshi demanded a proposal than expecting it to come her way naturally.I was bothered about the songs, but they smartly merged them with the storytelling. Particularly commercial films can't afford to lose the blue print of Indian cinema, since songs are the free television commercial, to popularise the film prior to its release. All the actors were great. The lead actor was at his best, especially when it comes to the technics in the games to match the Dhoni's style of play. Most of the locations are the actual locations, including the school, grounds and house(s). I think it was a good move.The film was not entirely true. They have changed the events to suit the cinematic. A man's 30 years of life journey to put into a 3 hour film, it has to be done and they did it neatly in Indian style. Some people are complaining about this and that, but that's understandable if you understand the concept of filmmaking, particularly money making film.Only the first two acts were very gripping. The final act was predictable, if you are an ardent cricket follower. Because you know everything on field about this man which is what covered in those parts. And the rest of the film was like behind the scenes of a film called his life. This is a wonder film, and I know the majority of the Indians won't miss it or had already watched it. But for the outsiders, this is not a bad flick, even if you don't know the sport or the player. Worth a try, otherwise definitely recommended.8½/10",8,0,0,24 February 2017
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The crucial portion of the story narration of 'Hobbit' trilogy.
","The second installment of the 'Hobbit' trilogy which is the prequel to 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. 365 days of wait is over, last year around the same day I saw 'An Unexpected Journey'. It totally blew me away with those awesome thrilling adventures and great graphics especially to watch a favourite movie in high frame rate gave a new dimensional experience. Also to see the 'The Lord of the Rings' character in digital 3D especially Gollum was amazing.The movie kick starts with the director Peter Jackson's cameo as he crosses over from left to right on the screen having a bite of a carrot in a town called Bree. Then the missing scene from the first part of 'Hobbit' commence where the great wizard Gandalf the Grey offers the help to the dwarfs to reclaim their kingdom. After that the narration continues from where it ended in 'An Unexpected Journey'. The nonstop exciting journey of dwarfs proceeds in the middle-earth nothing lesser than its earlier part with the company of a Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. So the hope remains in Thorin, the next king of Erebor to fight back their enemy and take a revenge.The missing in this movie is the Gollum, I don't think he will come back in the next installment as well. A little disappointing for Gandalf fans as well. He was not in action as much we aspired to see his magical stuffs. If you are a die hard 'The Lord of the Rings' the list goes on. In another way it is great to see new faces around. But you must remember it is not the movie(s) about the 'ring', it is the dwarfs tale where it all happens before Gimli, son of Gloin.Like I said the good thing is the reintroduction of the Elvin prince of Woodland Realm, Legolas. Last time we saw him in the final battle of middle-earth in the movie 'The Return of the King'. The 'Lost' fame Evangeline Lilly was the newest major addition of the series and she was amazing. She lonely fulfilled the due of women's contribution of this particular movie of 'Hobbit' trilogy. Like she Luke Evans was also had a prominent role but I guess his major action sequences will come in the next part.In this and next paragraph I gonna write some good's and bad's of this movie. I wanna begin by saying HFR was unbelievable, the picture quality was very good with no blurs in fast panning camera sequences. I know few people may get hard time to adjust with smoothness in motion but you will get used to it if you already saw the first. Compared to 'An Unexpected Journey' it had a little more drama in story narration but as usual it had the adventures that happen in a tight situation. There's a similar kind escape scene what we had seen under the mountain kingdom Goblin. Here which happen in the water I mean the river where dwarfs are getting escaped from the Elves and of course the Arcs.'My arm is like tenfold shields, my teeth are like swords, my claws are the spear, the shock of my tail is a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane and my breath death' is what the Smaug describes himself angrily. In this whole movie all I expected was to see the Smaug, the last great dragon of middle-earth. As we know it was an adaptation of children's book so I was curious to see Smaug to talk. In all the last four movies I have not seen talking animal as per my knowledge. The first time I got the impression of the root base of fantasy touch like we had seen in 'Narnia' and 'Harry Potter' movie series. The British actor Benedict Cumberbatch gave his incredible voice and performance through motion capture to the Smaug.There's nothing we can do than have a peek while it is in the cinema hall. As usual this movie will bomb the box office. I am already beginning to think about the 2015 Christmas holiday, without 'Hobbit' it will be most disappointment festival season. As for now I gonna end 2013 with this masterpiece.Tolkien would have been blown away to see his own creation in a breathtaking motion picture. He wrote it keeping in mind children, as based on a children the movie achieved the heights that no one ever imagined which attracted the adults more than children. So all the credits go to the man behind it, Peter Jackson and then the his cast and crew. Now I have to wait another 365 days to have the grand finale of the 'Hobbit' series, feels like one more decade to go. In the mean time I might see it again and wait for the Blu-ray. So what's your plan...",10,4,12,14 December 2013
The Fault in Our Stars," It's unfair to let it go, what we love the most in the world.
","The director might be soaring after back to back success. Interestingly, both the films dealt with writers, but the main themes were romance. He's just a two movie old and now the movie goers can expect eagerly for his next venture. This movie was based on the teen novel of the same name about a 16-years-old cancer patient.Hazel Grace, who is battling between life and death is also a strong fighter against all the odds. When her mother sends her to attend the group therapy she meets Augustus Water, a fellow member. As she is being sarcastic, Waters finds an interesting character in her. A friendship develops and they spend more time together. Even knowing there will no future together, the relationship progress and how everything ends is the rest.Usually cancer themed movies are called tearjerker films. Surprisingly, this movie's aim was different. Of course emotion strikes, but the story narration and character developments were the basic goal. Three-fourth of the movie was well told story about teen romance. The afterwards account begins with a twist which were portrayed in the usual manner. Like all the movies, kept sentiments in the last part. The last quarter was very predictable, but they avoided cliché as much possible.''Apparently, the world is not a wish-granting factory.''The parents' role was kind of mysterious one, that diverts viewer from their anticipation. Interesting it also creates some doubts. Compared to the previous movie 'The Spectacular Now', Shailene Woodley looked completely different. That means the physical transformed to look a perfect 16 year old was amazing. Her performance as well gives an impression that the Hollywood's future Academy award grabbing the female lead is on making. At this rate she can do that like Jennifer Lawrence did.As for the lead actor, it is a good breakthrough and expecting the same result from his next movie as well. This movie, which runs over a 2 hour was smartly sliced the contents and organized those on the right spots. Many had agreed it was a fine cinema transformation from a book. So you can try this, but be careful because nowadays most of the teens movies are overrated because of the overwhelmed teen audience. The warning meant only for the older people. I'm sure the youngster will love this movie, I mean most of them.",8,0,2,12 November 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Return of the Epic to all the Epics
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012)First I like to start with that I am one hell 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy fan freak, it is EPIC to all the EPICS in human history of filmdom. I voted many movies for 10 outa 10 but by far LOTR stays in highest peak point on that list. I never compare HOBBIT to LOTR because the time and technology differentiate both the movie (trilogy) and I request you all not to do that. Another solid reason is that I saw LOTR as plain live action graphic movie but saw HOBBIT a decade later in 3D with advance CGI technics in it.Now lets talk about 'An Unexpected Journey', The first installment of 'The Hobbit' trilogy which tells the untold adventurous story of Bilbo Baggins, the ring holder, which take place 60 years early to the actual LOTR, it also tells how Bilbo Baggins ends with the precious Ring in his pocket that everyone in the Middle Earth was looking for it over the centuries. As usual stunning visuals, Peter Jackson did hell great job by handing the massive characters/cast/role and also got what he wanted from CGI technicians, It was not gigantic cast like LOTR trilogy though. In fact I have seen only 33.333...% of the movie so far I mean I yet to see other two parts (66.666...%) which make it a trilogy so my rating for this movie is temporary till next two years.The movie begins with slow dramatic style, introducing all the characters one after one otherwise some could get mix up to identify all the dwarfs who look alike. And then little fun get pass through middle of the movie with small-small adventures then begins second half where most of the real adventures take place which kick starts with mountain Trolls. Extraordinary 3D effects with few great pop-ups, some action sequences were simply breathtaking especially one in underground Goblin city is treat for eyes specially if you see it in 3D version, expected ultra slow motion images Like what we see in cricket, sadly I did not get chance to see the movie in 48fps, that really scuks as being LOTR fan, great to see 500 years old freaky, an aggressive Gollum in 3D, you gonna witness the best Gollum in technically, Andy Serkis did great job in his short phase. There is a brief scene where this movie meets 'Fellowship of the Ring' where Gollum lose his Ring in a dark cave and that situation was bit strange and different than what we saw in LOTR may be because it was brief like i said before. Meet between them, Bilbo Baggins and Gollum was more like funny simultaneously frighting too, specially kids may feel that. Background score was so great throughout the movie like previous trilogy, even some songs too. When movie ended I left cinema hall like everyone else but felt I still wanted another hour of it, I was forced to leave the place :( How many of you will agree me, it started slowly but ended strongly, that's why all this drama of me.In world cinema, there will be always some characters which will remain in people's mind forever, like the Joker, Jack Sparrow, Dark Vander etc, like that Galdalf is for LOTR, of course including Gollum, Ian McKellen was so awesome in all the four movies, without him or replace of him is like a bowl of curd rice without a Piece of pickle.Overall an excellent standard movie, must see in big screen with 3D version specially if you are a film freak you should not miss it, some people might have not get satisfied with movie but all I can say is still another two is yet to come so it will make difference at least then. Now all we can do is wait.....10/10",10,13,28,14 December 2012
Non-Stop," A simple suspense-thriller that set in the altitude.
","It was an entertaining thriller set in a small surrounded area. I mean the whole movie takes place on a plane while it was flying above the ocean between two continents. As we know it was shot in a studio as much possible limited budget. Very well made movie with good support from the cast. Earlier I believed it was like the British movie 'Panic Button', except the limited passengers. If you had seen that, you would thought similar way. Anyway, it was lots better than that, except the pace.Since the movie 'Taken' most of the Liam Neeson movie's were similar type. At least all his characters were portrayed close to each others and in this movie it was not spared. Of course, there have been lots of changes made. He played as an alcoholic air marshal in this. On his duty while his plane carrying hundreds of passengers to London from New York, he gets hinted that a man on board trying to threaten the safe journey. On the midway, over Atlantic ocean he's clueless, but must find him before everything he said turn into reality. So the game begins between the good and bad. Whether the plane safely lands its destination is the movie's finale.''I always kind of liked flying, six hours in one seat and nobody can get to you.''The suspense was better than I expected. It puts the viewers to engage in solving the puzzle. So the entertainment was promised till the twist come into play. Once the it explains its mystery that was carried all the way, at that moment I felt it was not cleverly done. Slightly not a satisfied solution for curiosity it created. Because it was simple and predictable once you come to know the truth. Especially the bad guys were weak in strength to handle the good guy. Julianne Moore role was looked kind of comedy to me. I would have not agreed to do that if I was her. Anyway the story asked for pawns to draw a confusion graph while narrating the main plot. A nice mystery movie, starts well, developed well in the middle, but did not end in similar fashion. To me the conclusion could have been a better, otherwise it would have not been an acceptable action-thriller.6.5/10",7,0,1,8 July 2014

","Like I said a couple of year ago during 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2' review, it's a terrible title for a sequel. The host, Neil Patrick also said the same thing during the 2015 Oscars. But in the digital world, slight change in the title makes random in order. I mean on the computer and web world, it won't show in order. Even sometime it might get lost in a vast number of other titles if they dare to chance the first word in the title for a sequel. Other than that they are not stupid as many people think. That's why they highlighted 'Dragon' boldly than the rest of the words.This part two was not much different to its first. The story continues five years after Hiccup recovers from his injury. He and his pet, Toothless discovers a new land during the survey for the map. So their's adventure begins, but end in a trouble and forces all his people from the town to involve and fight against the rising evil force that tries to conquer them all.Like I always say, those days are gone, now animated movies are for all ages. This was a very nicely and carefully written screenplay, did not fail to deliver. Very close to the impact the first movie made, but due to simplicity it stayed a couple of steps behind. Developed well with a bit of suspense, thrill and entertainment. Nothing more we could have asked, a perfect follow-up and hoping to explore beyond lot more in the upcoming movies in this series. Four years gap between the movies is a nice idea and fine breathing space for this franchise fan. A movie must be seen by animation fans, especially if you have already seen the first then don't miss it. 8/10",8,1,3,3 May 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," As far I know only Wes Andy can do magic like this.
","One of the director I always look forward to his movie release is that Wes Anderson. Well, who don't like his movies if they are aware of his masterworks. He's one of the unique filmmakers with extraordinary ideas. I always love his screenplay, especially his miniature cinema sets. He believes in those technics and presents on the screen awesomely than completely done with computer graphics. In this movie as well he used them very nicely and gives pleasure to watch it.As usual this movie too a comedy with director's traditional actors in it. A comedy that set in the backdrop of a hotel theme and their employees. This hotel is called 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' located on the edge of the Alp mountain in a fictional EU country Zubrowska. The story proceeds with the two layers of flashback to the years 1968 and 1932. It unfolds the life story of Gustave, prestigious hotel's caretaker and his pupil Zero, a lobby boy. Theirs struggle over the accusation of a crime and the other side world war is on a verge to invade the nation. Whether they successful to defend against the charges or not is the remaining story speaks.Nice story and performances with eye catching visuals. Easily one of the best of this year. It looks very ordinary if it was a usual style movie, but Wes Anderson's touch made all the differences. The adventures are the highlights in all of his movies and so in this movie. Lots of whites and pinks you can see on the screen which is kind of trademark of this movie. In this humour movie violence partially attached, but safely avoided all the cruelties. With the lend of Saoirse Ronan character the story exploits a little bit youthful romance side. The introduction of other characters in the middle of the storytelling made more venturesome in the later parts.I kind of doubt to suggest it if you are unfamiliar with Wes Anderson's earlier works. You should better start with them before committing this movie. There's a reason, because you may not indulge it like my friend who saw this with me who never hear the director. Otherwise, it is..., of course it is another masterwork by Wes. Anyway, I loved it and waiting for his new project announcement.",8,1,3,17 June 2014
It Follows," An innovative horror-drama with a simplicity.
","It was not too long ago I saw the director's other film, his first one and liked it instantly. I did not expect him to go all the way from a beautiful teen drama to a creepy horror flick. But I liked this movie as well, thus that prove he's not a fluke. After seeing his both the films, I can detect the style of presentation that marks his trademark. That is very realistic, dull, but a natural societal atmosphere with a mere background score.I have said many times that these days horror flicks are heavily leaning on the scary noise/sounds. But this film brings the tone that's really happening around us. The story was like a straight flowing river, no twists or turns like the Amazon river. Even it did not try to hide the existence of the evil spirit. Not only from us, but among the characters in the story. That means it is a very simple tale with the compelling scenes.It does not look like a cheap horror, this 2 million movie can stand up to any fancy horror flicks. The writer/director's interpretation was very interesting too. Like he said IT could board a plane to follow who he's after. The theme was also very innovative. Quite similar types have made out, but this one was way better. Yep, many movie goers overwhelmed by the unexpected, even the filmmakers for the response.Now I pray for if there is going to be a sequel, it must be made by the same writer/director. My worry is the B category filmmakers going to spoil the original in the name of follow-up. I highly recommend this movie, especially for adults due to the plot that develops on the sexual intercourse. Though there's no strong nudity. I also suggest you to watch at night, if possible alone. I won't guarantee that it would scare out of you, but that's the best way to watch any horror flick.8/10",8,3,10,4 November 2015
Get Out," Now you're in the sunken place!
","Not all the directional debut sees this kind of welcome from the audience. Yeah, Jordan Peele had written and directed it. It is similar to the 90s style mystery-thrillers. Definitely must see for the 90s, 80s guys. It kind of looked like a black comedy, but I guess that's not they had preferred. Especially that teacup scenes and some of the close up shots, that freaks, yet very funny.Well, this is the story of an interracial romance. When Chris decides to meet his girlfriend's white family, living outskirt of her hometown, all goes as planned. But he was not sure how her parents take it, that he's a black. Now everything has settled, but his visit started to take a strange turn after a series of weird events. What it is and how he overcomes it is the remaining tale.The casting was amazing. The story was suspenseful. You would feel you can predict the scenes, but not that easy and when twist happens, you will realise it was simple as that. This is a hit film now, but if it was 20 years ago, surely would have gotten a cult classic status. And yes it is, thinking the future.When this got out and its pre release, I thought it would disappear without any trace. It is rare a recognition a film like this to get to having a second string cast, debutante director and being a low cost film. I got entertained thoroughly as it delivered as promised. But I think some people are overjoyed and praising it like crazy. That's true if you are not a film fanatic, otherwise it is one of those decent films. Surely not to be missed. One of the best of this year.7/10",7,11,20,14 July 2017
Frozen," FROZEN is this year's TANGLED
","The Disney studio should be in happy for this year's Academy awards nominees. They got this movie in the short list of the best animated movie. The live shot 'Saving Mr. Banks' and 'The Lone Ranger' got nodes to compete with others in different categories. Whether they win it all or not Disney people will be more than satisfied for the nomination tag for their movies which will stay forever.A decade ago, people called Disney is done and dusted but in recent couple of years, it was a great come back for them. 'Tangled' put them on the track, now with this wonderful family movie they are more confident. Yeah, I loved this movie a lot for many reasons. It was fast, sentimental, romantic and had adorable, cute 3D character models.I think Disney studio is following on the footsteps of Studio Ghibli. I believe they found their strength in the name of the young girl's role in their recent movies. Like Rapunzel for 'Tangled' this movie had Anna. Both the movies backed by pleasant music and admirable animal character with awesome facial expressions for humorous in parts of the storytelling.I had seen all the nominees of this year's animation movie, except Studio Ghibli's 'The Wind Rises'. I liked 'Monster University', it was fun, but 'The Croods' attracted me a lot. I was hoping French animation 'Ernest & Celestine' could win, but after seeing it no doubt on why it got the honour. So I am happy for this movie's win at the big event.9.5/10",10,5,14,4 March 2014
The Number 23," One of the special movie from Jim Carrey's filmography
","Well, the number 23 is a special to me. It's my birth date and I consider myself, it's a lucky number. This is the number which always pops-out when I wanted to pick a number. During watching team sports I always watch-out for who's wearing a jersey with this number. So the number 23 is everything to me and watched this movie 7 years ago (today, 2014) with high expectations which stood up to my belief. Here I am after a re-watch.You know mystery movie are not meant to watch again and again, because you won't get that real twist when you re-watch. That is a big drawback in this particular genre. All we need is to give a good concentration while we watch for the first time and must not miss a single dialogues. But in my case I saw it a long ago, now I didn't remember much of the movie scene except the storyline. So I had a little advantage over that to view it again and I am glad this movie impressed me in the second time as well.You won't see much of Jim Carrey in a serious role. This is one of those where he's out of his league, the comedies. I thought it was a dark comedy, at least it kick started sounding like that way. But after progressing with good story development it turned so ridiculously deep into a main character who was obsessed with the number 23. It began with a simple misunderstanding over a something, but later digs intellectually with more broader expansion towards a parallel story that was written in a red book.It is a great movie, which stays true to its genre and makes audience to begin their guessing game soon the red book enters into the frames. It also had a wonderful twist with the meaningful dialogues at the end. It is a must see movie from the perspective of the Jim Carrey's filmography. One of the movies of him to remember his appearance in a divergent character than usual. Hope I gonna see it again after some years from now on and expect to remain same warmth, maintaining everlasting strength from its main plot to deliver me.",8,1,1,26 May 2014
Room," Discovering a whole new world beyond the 4 walls.
","We all know the German folk tale 'Rupanzel', and this is a similar kind with entirely different motive. All the above it is not a fairy tale set in the medieval period, but inspired by many real events of the present era. A couple of years ago I saw a German movie called '3096 Days' based on the true story. When I heard of this movie is being made, at first obviously I remembered that title, but after seeing the poster alone convinced me not the same. Automatically the expectations rose, and now it's got the 4 Oscars nominees, including the best motion picture.The both halves of the movie were entirely different from each other like the two sets of story, but the core of the theme remains same. The first half was a crucial part that takes place completely in a single room with a minimal cast. It does not go through the intro, just begins to tell the story like it's already happening and you might take a few minutes to realise the state of condition. The next half is a reaction to what happened in the previous. And again this is also an important storytelling section because like the title, it was not all about the room, but beyond that 4 walls and its roof and floor like how it affected the mother and son.'If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.'The movie does not talk about the crime feature at all. Not even considered to reveal behind the motive. So the other side mystery remains as it is. The whole narration was one sided, everything was seen through the eyes of a five year old boy. He begins with the line 'Once upon a time...' like a fairy tale, because it is to him and with his cute little performance along with Brie Larson's, the movie briefs their struggle for freedom.It was a too casual opening, like nothing bad is really happening, just they're weird people or maybe agoraphobia, except they're not. You know when we say we love to be kids again to escape this complicated adult life, sometimes we won't mean it except it was a normal reaction to the situation we're in. But what if a five year old boy wants to be four again when her mother thinks its time to him know what the real world looks like. Yeah, that's a too much to take in for a young boy, but that's the best chance they had to break free from the psycho who put her mother in that room.'When I was small, I only knew small things. But now I'm five, I know everything.'It was a tidy place, but the camera angles were impressive. I know it was shot in a studio with a wide open space behind the camera, but that does not the viewpoint in the actual story. When the first half ends, it is an indication of the good parts are over, at least that's what I thought of, but what came after was the unexpected expansion in narration. Usually most of the similar tales end in that part itself like for example 'Prisoners' and the rest is understandable stuff that won't be shown.When a tale had a ending like 'happily ever after', still some people desire for it to continue a few more minutes to know how happy really they are and that's what this film's second half. Remember, most of the similar themes have multiple perspectives, like how victim's family is coping with, cops are pursuing the suspect, abductor's plans and motive, and captives struggle. Like I said it was all about what a mother and her son goes through those years in captivity and after that.There were some suspicious characters and events like I had a bad feeling over the doctor's soft talking, also the mother-son's master plan when in captive. Those are tiny diversions to viewers assume differently against where the story is heading. It is all about the mother and son's mental trauma, especially for the little boy similar to when Tarzan is in a big town for the first time leaving behind his other life. It was a perfect pace as well, neither hurried nor a slow development. The movie was a big break for many, especially for the Irish director, and Brie Larson and of course for the kid. Definitely one of the finest movie of 2015 and a must watch.9/10",9,1,7,24 February 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Zoned out can be cured if you dare the reality.
","As we know that Ben Stiller is a fine actor mostly in comical roles. But no one ever used better than himself in his own directions. Yes, most of his great performances and movies came under his steering of the ship. This is the one more movie where he exposed his creativity in filmmaking as well as acting.'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' was anticipated to be one of an Oscar node for the 86th ceremonial season, but failed unexpectedly. That did not stop the movie to the viewers to enchant with its beautiful contents. The movie was shot in many exotic places around the world, especially the sub-arctic countries like Greenland, Iceland et cetera are so alluring. According to the story the movie won't stick to the same location for more than 15-20 minutes. The constant change of places played a vital role in the movie's successive cinematographic presentation.It was a refreshing movie compared to the movies that released in the same year. In everything, from the distinct characters to the places it takes place to the technical parts. Those places as they say were not exactly the same. Most of them were shot in a studio and the rest were the magic of special effects.Like I always say critics are a bad influence for creative movie like this. This movie was thrashed by them, but movie fanatics are the one who stood by the side so I am happy to be one and I loved this movie. This movie was based on the short story of the same name that was published in a magazine in 1939 and was second movie adaptation after the 1947 version. If you are looking for a variety in a movie well here it is.",8,0,0,15 April 2014
X-Men: Apocalypse," Another ancient power was awoken and blah blah blah.
","I have seen almost all the superhero films of the recent time, but this is the franchise I never liked. I'm sorry to say that, but that's the truth. The 'X-Men' series never made me sense, particularly to say it from the Marvel comics is a disappointment. When it comes to 'Wolverine', my opinion is different, because I loved those films. Hugh Jackman as Logan is the only 'X-Men' I love, so like usual this is another waste of time from its series to me.I even enjoyed the recently rebooted 'Fantastic Four', but not this one. There's nothing new in the story, it's the same plot stolen from the different films. Like an ancient force is awoken who tries to rule the world by destroying everything created so far by the humans. So the mutants join hands to bring him down and we know what happens at the end. Apart from the vfx, this is very boring film and 150 minutes runtime was another lengthy joke that you never laugh.Not just me, many people, even 'X-Men' fans showed displeasure over this film. That means, Bryan Singer's stint with the franchise is pretty much over. So they will going to bring a new one and that's another disappointment, because I don't know how long they're going to drag this series. End it already. Anyway, like I said I never was or will be this universe fan, so I don't care much, rather I just give them a try when they get released and obviously I'm to end in regret watching. Instead, I'm looking forward to the final 'Wolverine' film with Hugh Jackman.5/10",5,1,3,14 October 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," At the lowest point in Spider-man movies.
","The second movie in the new Spider-man movie series that directed by Marc Webb. I doubt his potential after seeing this movie. I feel someone should take his position before it become too late. In the history of the Spider-man movies, from all the 6 this one is the worst. Commercially it has done a great business that grabbed around $800 million all over the world, but failed to deliver another quality movie for the fans. The movie engaged with the too much character and subplots. The subplots were not placed in the right spots, kind of random appearance brings the chaos in understanding the story. I had a high hope on this movie and it did not supply well. Frankly, I kind of lost interest in Spider-man. Maybe because it was too soon to reboot, I guess.''You want to be the hero. And now you gotta pay the price.''The first movie gave a decent re-start for the refreshed Spider-man movie series. And what happened here in this second installment was a disaster. The first thing is it was nearly a 2 and half an hour movie that brought me lightly a headache to carry on thus far. Actually, it was 10 minutes shorter than what it is now, but in the end they have developed a bit longer to show the opening scene of the third movie. When a movie got a powerful hero, it should have equally matched antagonist. If they are matched, then the fight between them are the next thing to bring the best out of it. I think the Electro man did not click as they have expected, at least not to me. The strength he had was something beyond spider-man, but did not unleash him in a perfect manner. Though Jamie Foxx was not bad in that avatar, the filmmakers kind of wasted his presence for not so good scenes.Remember the original Spider-man was the modern superhero movies, I mean it was done using computer graphics. Afterwards 'Batman', 'Iron Man', 'Thor' and all were followed. I like the version with Tobey Maguire in it, though my rating declined by movie after another in the trilogy. This reboot series had a good opening, but failed to get the momentum going. Especially all the emotions were looked fakes that do not appeal like the original movie series did. Yes, it had a wonderful box office and that does not mean the movie is good, either worst. But expected a little better, especially in the negative characters. Andrew Garfield was good, not awesome, because most of his masked parts were CGI. Emma stone was another let down and could not help comparing her with Kristen Dunst, because she was no way near, at all. The Dane DeHaan role had the same issue and I don't know why people did not get better space in the movie that ran 140 minutes long. Like I said subplot spoiled everything I think. The digital 3D and stunts were poor. Yeah, there are many things to complain about it than to praise, but all the answer should come in the next sequel. If that makes bigger, not commercially, I mean with a good story, graphics and performances then there will be no problem. But if it fails, I had to say 'bring back the fourth installment of the original movie series'. Definitely not worth a watch, but anyway most of the guys going to watch it or already watched it.",6,3,8,31 August 2014
Grudge Match," A bit of fun and a bit of drama till the battle begin.
","The actors from the 80s coming together mean it must be something great. There's no youth left in them for a concept like this, but the alteration of the story well suited for these fellows. As far I know Robert De Niro is not made for hardcore stunts, surprisingly he managed to give his best in this movie. And no need to praise Sylvester Stallone when it come to a movie based on boxing.The trailer was different that what I saw today in the movie. It totally misled me, I thought the movie was about computer game where two ex champions meet, but it went way beyond to the final battle. My eye was on De Niro, his entry in unfamiliar arena, the boxing. For Stallone it is like the return of Rocky Balboa.A little bit of fun and a little bit of drama. The story commenced with the early life of two rivalry boxers and moves all the way to the next 30 years. The uncomfortably settled life forces them to come together one final time and the rest of the story brief these legend's preparation for the grudge match. Recently saw plenty of movies based on old guys, but this movie is not that often you see. Well crafted movie, but only a just above the average, which mostly a time pass movie.",7,0,0,1 April 2014
Pawn Sacrifice," With this 'Searching for Bobby Fischer' is over for me.
","I know Bobby Fischer a genius American chess player, in fact, after watching the 'Searching for Bobby Fischer', which is another biopic as this one. Other than that I know nothing about his life, so I'm very thankful for this film. From the director of many sensational flicks comes this to inspire you. Wait, did I say inspire, but I'm little confused over how this film to be considered. Bobby Fischer was a great player, but he had some mental issues. So you can compare him to John Nash from 'A Beautiful Mind', except they're from different fields, but very intelligents.This film was a little patriotic abut the American nation, especially defeating the Russians in the chess game. So I'm being neutral here. Bobby was the one to focus how he makes his life big with the game that requires a brain. The story began with short span of childhood and then soon skipped to adult Bobby Fischer competing in a biggest tournament in the world, a championship against the best. Nicely filmed with lots of exciting scenes, particularly Tobey Maguire as the main lead was brilliant. Liev Schreiber was another surprise with his frequent on and off role.Good film, but feels it is not complete, there should have more to it and like I said earlier, it has impacted, but not inspiring way which is why I'm doubting the screenplay. A man like him and a film about him should have nominated for several international awards, including the Golden Globe and the Oscars. Sadly, it failed at the box office, as well as to get recognised at the film festival circuits. Still, it got praised, looks not for the artistic work, but as the compensation. If you watch it, you will know there's something wrong, otherwise a film like this won't go unnoticed. I hope someone else makes another film about him in a grand way. Meanwhile, it is a good watch, but what do you expect from the Bobby Fischer like his game or personal issues will decide how much you liked it.7/10",7,0,0,14 September 2016
Magic Mike XXL," Just not my cup of tea.
","I have seen the first part and I don't remember I felt the same way as I did for this. My point is, this film is for women and maybe that including the gays. Being a straight male, I find it's not fun or entertaining, but I felt it pulled me further away as the movie progressed without balancing the content as a product for everyone.I know, no one asked my opinion. I respect the movie, at least it aimed for a certain section of the audiences. The road trip was fine to me, except the music and the dance parts. Thankfully, there's no nudity, except once, but still an R rated movie for strong sexual appeal.Whatever the theme was about, I expected a good story. But it was a lot like a documentary. No focus on any particular characters, but Channing Tatum was in a prime position. No development either in the story other than a group that embark a road trip to participate in a competition. Nothing anything like the first film, kind of detached from afar.So I won't expect you to feel as the way I did on this, but you could consider my points and can judge whether want to watch it. Still, I'm not suggesting to boycott the film. I'm neutral, and all I'm saying is that it did not impress me, but it might you, especially if you are a woman.4/10",4,2,2,14 January 2016
Hidden Figures," The other side story of the historic event!
","This film did not just represented the black people, but the women as well. Today we talk about discrimination against women, though this film is an example that it all had started way long ago, yet the struggle has not ended. Anyway, this is a biopic, a biopic of three women and their struggle not just being a black, but being women. When the nation was eager to send its first man to the space, there was some trouble within the team who are behind it to work together as one. Lots of inspiring events reveal how the history was made and the working culture was changed forever inside the NASA.The film was nominated for the Oscars in the three slots, but did not win any. That's fine, because I would prefer those real women to be recognised over what this film had achieved. All the three actresses were good. Their roles were unique from one another. Really a wonder film about three real persons in one film. Something rare in films to highlight their achievements equally. The personal life, as well as their professional was well briefed.The others like Kevin and Dunst in small part were also good. Directed by just a one film old filmmaker. He did good. The screenplay was adapted from the book of the same name. Deserved all the awards and praises it had received. After seeing how it had ended, a sequel could be possible. Mission Moon. I hope they would consider it! Seems a nice idea!8/10",8,0,3,14 September 2017
Sing Street," Back to the 80s with rock and roll and romance.
","I seriously thought this might be an overrated film. I knew it was too early to judge it, so I was not expecting anything extraordinary and then it struck me with its progress, I was clean bowled by its style and cuteness. I don't what others think, but this is John Carney's masterpiece according to me. I liked his other films, but this is something I think a perfect dose of contents. In two words to say it is a Golden Touch. I rarely like music and musical films, and it had been long since one I had enjoyed very much like this. Definitely this should be one of the top ten films of the years.This is an Irish-British film that is set in the Dublin, 1985. It is about a high school boy named Conor, who just got transferred from a private school to a free state-run boy's school after his parents imposed a plan on the budget cut. New school and problems are ahead where he has to come out of it on his own. During getting used to it, he meets a girl who lives nearby the school and to impress her, he lies that he has a band and looking for a female singer. So then he forms one with the amateur musicians and the journey begins for these teenagers that reveals in the remaining film how long they are willing to go.'Your problem is that you're not happy being sad. But that's what love is, Cosmo. Happy-sad.'At the end of the final scene, there is a note that says 'For brothers everywhere'. I was impressed by that, because I did not pay attention on that while watching the film. What I meant was, this is not some teenage love story, actually it was about the brothers, but overshadowed by romance theme. I recalled my memories on those parts and quickly realised the centre of the story that how it was developed. The one who played the older brother of Conor simply looked alike Seth Rogan and that is the character you have to watch out for. He's only a supporting character, but the impact was indirectly larger on the story.Of course, falling in love might make you do crazy things, even you can become a rockstar overnight. But there's a first step for everything and it is not assured that you will be succeed by those attempts. That is where comes the experienced hand, the brother, a close friend who stood by us since our birth. It is easy to fall in love, but it is not easy to have a brother who guides us in every move on that.In this film the sreenspace between them was very little, but that did not stop to disclose how one's inspiration that got from love to mold accurate shape and to lead the right path. I don't have any brother, but I felt how it would be to have one. So all the brothers in the world must see it, this is dedicated to them.'It's like when you don't know someone, they are more interesting. They can be anything you want them to be. But when you know them, there's limits to them.'I did not grow up in the 80s, but was very close to it and I know how it would feel to be born in that generation. Jeans, thick hair and curls, everybody was so thin, weird make-ups with strong eyeliner, big eyeglasses, cassettes, you would love this film if you remember those stuffs from your fading memories.A very stylish music-comedy and on the romance side, this film was very cute. All the actors were brilliant, especially the lead boy whose first film was this and the girl amazing with her totally electrifying look. They both going have a great future in filmdom. Not to miss out the supporting cast who did their part so well, especially the brother I talked about in the other paragraph.All the sound tracks were awesome. I should start adding them to my 'film songs' collection, especially 'The Riddle of the Model' which defines this title and the film's climax song 'Go Now'. So from the cast to crew, equal credits must given to the music composers and lyricists from the real 80s bands. The film had a perfect runtime, I would have had no issue if it was extended for another half an hour.The pace of the narration always kept in a same position, but towards the final quarter it has gone up. Yes, I loved the ending, it was touching, but I don't know how to describe it, only one can experience it by himself. A film I watched without any anticipation, now it is one of my favourite films. Todays generation might take it as another rock and roll inspired theme, but only the middle aged guys and some old ones would know how to enjoy it. So don't miss it out if you are one of them.8.5/10",9,1,2,14 August 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," They're not chosen ones, accidentally messed up ones.
","I read comics and manga only that published in the newspapers and weekly magazine, other than that I am not into the comic books. So I must admit that I never heard before 'Guardians of the Galaxy' till this project start to commence. That means I had no expectations, I mean the expectation was nil. Especially after seeing the trailers and teasers I was totally repelled away to see strange characters like a tree, raccoon and other colorful skin tone human like creatures. Frankly, I thought it would end up badly as 'Green Lantern' did. I discarded my negative thoughts and decided to go after all I am a movie fanatic and that's what I do. I can say all these things were in my advantage when I went to sit in the cinema hall like an empty minded. The opening credits began to roll, me too slowly started to dissolve with the movie. It was not even 5 minutes passed, but I was into it. In the end, I was very impressed like never before and how much? That's what I am going to explain in the below paragraphs.''I am Groot.''First, I never heard this director, kind of new in town (to me). When I checked his filmography I came to know that I loved his movie 'Super'. What a breakthrough he got from this movie to enter into the big director's league list. He's also going to make a sequel for this as well and that is the real test to prove he's not just lucky to get away with this movie. Because many has predicted it won't stand tall in the box office. But what I witnessed was exactly opposite. The responsibility has become so heavier.Secondly, its a another 3M or MMM. Don't get confused, I was saying Marvel's Marvelous Magic. Other side Disney and Pixer are battling each others in animation field to dominate. In superhero themes, is there anyone to challenge Marvel? It is like one man's pride walk on the streets of Hollywood. Recently I said in the 'Need for Speed' review that EA joined something like the same, but a unique league to transform their games into the feature films. Whatever they do, it is our gain for sure. It was Marvel's sixth movie series from 'comic-to-movie' conversion, after Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, including The Avengers.A story of a boy called Peter Quill, who was taken away from his home planet, Earth by the space pirates. 20 years later he becomes a skilled thief and calls himself Star-lord. As usual in one of his missions he meets some strange guys who are after the orb he stole from an isolated planet. Soon he realizes it is a bigger issue once he come to know what does orb do. Unexpectedly a five member team forms. They decide to work towards one purpose, but the thing is they are mismatched in everyway. That leads each others to get misunderstand, misuse and failures, in one word to say the losers. After the series of screw-up how they unite against the strongest villain in the galaxy Ronan was told before it wraps up with a grand final fight.Yeah, I know the story was very simple. Men after the object that gives the power and strength is what's commonly known theme nowadays. But the beautiful cast and performances, including astonishing visuals will definitely change the viewer's perspective. It is going to be a game changer for the Chris Pratt's career. Like always Zoe Saldana had been excellent and sexy under the alien skin avatar. Vin Diesel had the least display of all the lead characters, especially with his one and only dialogue that repeats all the time. The character Rocket was another impressive, voice rendered by Bradley Cooper. Me too, to call him a raccoon kind of feel it is a racism remark. LOL. Definitely it is one of the top in the list of non-human or graphical character in a live-shot movie appearance. I think it was one of the biggest role ever Dave Bautista did. He was equally great to all the above, I stated. The cast was really a big, only those I mentioned in the above lines were having major portions in this installment. So expecting the others' time will come in the follow-up movies.''We are the bunch of jackass standing in the circle.''Like I said the story was not the problem here because it was presented with plenty of fresh humor. Don't expect it like a serious movie with a serious mission that takes place travelling all around the galaxy in a spaceship. Especially it was far better than 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. It is what stands in the line after the movies 'Star Wars', 'Star Trek' etc but filled with lots of fun. There was a scene in the end that comes before the credits, just for the fun and the post credit scene was resembled to what 'Pacific Rim' had one.The visuals were very pleasing, it goes straight to the list of mine 'stunning digital 3D movies'. It got many long focus shots with sometime aerial views which give opportunity for the viewers to enjoy the inside deep depth. And the close-up shots with a very few pop-outs. So I am saying this movie is a must watch in the digital 3D version. Overall, it was a great first movie in the franchise, that concentrated only the adventures which presented in a good pace. It also had a few minor flaws and leaves questions about the things that are not explained like Nova corps, the boy's background, especially about his parents and all. So expecting the sequel would cover up those. In the meantime, don't miss this movie if you have not seen yet, who knows it could be a movie of the season and mean it is.",9,5,9,9 August 2014
Prisoners," One of the year's wonder
","I witnessed many surprises this year and 'Prisoners' is one of those made me stun. With the big names in it, the movie revolves around a mysterious incident that puts two families into the sorrow. The deeply moving characters and its emotions are the movie's plus point and of course the great performance by the great actors as well. It is refreshing to see Hugh Jackman in a role the father to a missing child.A similar kinda movie to 'The Lovely Bones' where two young girls are go missing and their parent's never ending search for them begins. With a single clue they begin to dig every detail to bring back their children along with the help of a young cop. As expected character diversion had an important hand in mystify and confuse the viewers without falling for anything to conclude their prediction before it reveal itself.Fine photography. It was pleasant to see cool frames where there's no sun glare but always cloudy, shadow and dark atmosphere something like the movie 'The Awakening'. It brought real close to us the real grief of a family that we can almost feel it. Good or bad ending, the way it ends is all matters. In this story they give us an opportunity to take it either way as you want. One thing I was not convinced is the motivation for the abduction. The reason seemed to me a silly but in reality everything can be possible and sometimes it won't need reasons at all. Finally, it is a must not miss movie from the 2013 film calender.",9,1,1,20 December 2013
Logan," A farewell and a welcome!
","A perfect farewell to the only mutant who had solo films in 'X-Men' franchise. I never understood 'X-Men', I thought it was the worst superhero film series I've ever seen. But 'Wolverine' was the only reason I watched them all and particular, Hugh Jackman. There won't be Logan now onwards, though a set of new generation welcomed in this film, while saying goodbye to the old guys. So now what happens in the future of this franchise is a very suspense. Yet Logan had been the precious gem in the crown of 'X-Men', that mean it won't be the same anymore.After many years passed in the future, the last survivours of mutants hiding their identity and living among the humans. Logan and two others were attacked by the armed men when he decided to help a child mutant. Running away from them and looking for a place where they can be safe prioritised in the narration. More dramatised film in the franchise, but there are enough actions those who desire for that.It's an emotional time for the hardcore fans of Logan/Hugh Jachman. One final great performance by him and the little kid was also good. A well shot film, with minimum graphics and more realistic stunt sequences. Well, not all were real, too strong fights, too bloody, despite having a child actor in it. Yeah, it is a good film, I liked it, but not a masterpiece as you might have heard of. But anyway, it is a must see for the 'Wolverine' fans.7/10",7,2,8,4 July 2017
Everest," One of the most realistically approached adventure movie based on the real.
","I was completely surprised with the movie. Because I was expecting 'Vertical Limit' kind of movie. Like, you know, there's no heroic adventure with the incredible stunt sequences in it. But it was very real and more real. Usually while adapting the true events for the screen, unnecessary overdose stunts created to commercialise the product. But in this it was too much closer to the real world adventure, like a documentary film.It was a man versus the mother nature and nothing else. The human villains were not included or the romance and other subplots. It was a multi starrer movie. Lots of big names played only a small role and magnified the expectation for the movie. But like I said expecting awesomeness will lead you to a great disappointment. One must approach this movie with a clear mind for a good result, because I felt the film very honest, and being honest is always a bit boring.The film was emotionally very strong. No character developments, not individually, but the entire film was focused on one particular expedition taken by a couple of trekking teams that goes wrong after they got hit by a storm. This is Jason Clarke's one of the best films in a lead role, as well as for the director of 'Contraband'. I definitely regret missing it out in digital 3D. It is a good watch, absolutely refreshing from the mainstream commercial films.7/10",7,0,1,4 February 2016
Elysium," ELYSIUM was one of the years best sci-fi
","The movie is from the director of 'District 9' which sets in the year 2154 about the people of severely damaged earth and luxurious artificial habitat in the space. I could say this movie was not much distinct from Tom Cruise' recent science fiction. Both the movie deals about ruined earth and wealthier space station colony. More like it is a prequel to 'Oblivion' where robots are taking over from the human race. I enjoyed both, they were the finest science fiction of the year. 'Oblivion' was unique but 'Elysium' gives the same feeling to the movie 'District 9' where protagonist from both the movies get infected and suffers severely.Max (Matt Damon) is an orphan young man who is dreaming to escape the polluted earth and settle down in the luxurious place in the space called Elysium. He works in a factory where security robots are manufactured. One day something goes wrong with him while working, he begins to get sick. In order to get cured he must immediately visit the Elysium where poors from the earth are not allowed. He knows he can't enter legally so he must find an alternate way where he could reach his target.2013 was one of the best year in last the ten years for science fiction movie fans. I thoroughly enjoyed many movies along with my favourite of the year 'Gravity'. 'Elysium' is better than the average, I don't know why it was rated such low. But I could not get a few things like why should one install electronic chips and devices into his body to steal the classified data. I thought the pen drive or external HDD are more than enough. Whatever, this movie looked good to me and expecting you to enjoy it as well.",8,2,3,7 December 2013
The World's Fastest Indian," Chasing a dream halfway across the world.
","One of the inspiring biopic I have ever seen. It is about chasing a dream and it is never too late to do that so. Based on the story of a New Zealand motorcyclist Burt Munro. After spending 25 years to build a faster motorbike in the down under, now a very old Munro travel halfway across the earth to Bonneville speedway in the US to set a record. So what's the remaining of the tale reveals is that does his dream becomes reality or not.Awesome performance by Anthony Hopkins, but in some parts I was distracted by his fake Kiwi accent. Overall, not bad with his effort, he achieved the goal conveniently. It is one of the best road movie that directed by the 'Species' filmmaker. The 120 minutes was too short, but well covered story with inclusion of messages like anti smoking and alcohol consumption.It is a decade old film, never too late to watch a fine film like this, but inside I feel regret for the delay. I had no idea about the storyline. I thought it might be about Indians and then thought American Indians, but realised only while watching it that it is about a motorbike called Indian. It is surely a good family movie, especially if there is a motorbike maniac in the house. Highly recommended by me.9/10",9,0,0,24 June 2016
La La Land," They'd crossed each others life while chasing their dreams.
","I am not a big fan of modern musical films. So I was not expecting it to be a great or worst. The film opened with a song that I was not happy, because I did not like the verse or the music. And again to say, the modern timeline does not suit for the musical theme, unless it is a fantasy or an Indian film. The best part of the film was, those song fades away as the film progresses. But I kind of liked the drama/story part and the climax track with the quick flashback (kind of). Till that scene I was considering it an average film, but that one scene changed my stance. So, now I think it is a good film, but winning 6 Oscars, I don't know it deserved that.Yes, the director is known for making music and musical film, but he has not made many. He's young and so his career. Yep, I loved 'Whiplash'. One of my all time favourite. If that film had won 10 Oscars, I would have not surprised at all. After that flick, the people were anticipating, to exceed that success in this film. As it was received, no doubt for those people it was a different flick, but not for me. Especially if you watch lots of Indian films. By the way the film characters were nice, and so the story, but not the songs.Gosling and Stone were performed well. The chemistry between them was great. The narration was going decently until the end, which reminded me 'Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya' ending that I was not happy about, yet something different than usual. Sometimes I am okay with cliché than this kind of conclusion, just to bring a change in storytelling. Overall an enjoyable film, most people would love it. Some like me would say it is a decent flick, but there's always a few who would never favour it. Yet worth a watch.7/10",7,1,2,14 July 2017

Snowden," He who became a people's hero by betraying his own nation!
","I had like to begin by saying I'm not an American and I haven't seen the Oscar winning documentary 'Citizenfour'. But I'm very much aware of everything about it through the all kinds of coverages. So my perspective about the film will be true and about the content will be neutral. I have known about what this film dealt since the day it all began. I did not care much, but there are things to concern about it. Like if it is necessary to tap to prevent the serious threats, there's nothing wrong it that. Because, even if they have our private contents, they are not going to publish it or make money out of it. So that makes what Ed did was unethical and betrayal for his own country.In another angle, NSA's illegal surveillance questionable in many ways, but wrong is only a tiny thing. Because eyeing every single one of us seems wrong, though without examining all, nothing confirms, differentiate between right and wrong. So coming to the film, it was decently made one. The main reason is it was too long and many parts were boring. The theme was powerful like it was a one liner, but the film contents were very weak. Except Snowden passing the security, the rest of the story like why he did, including his personal life, particularly his romance was not good enough to make a film. This is very much suitable for a documentary than a feature film.But I liked the actors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was good, but not great. If he gets the Oscars nod, that's only because of the issue which the film inspired by, not because his phenomenal character display. The direction was decent, but not the screenplay. The film is not for everyone, but I recommend it to all as a must see. The main reason why you should watch it is to educate yourself. To learn what they are doing and how. Particularly, you will definitely come to know how to avoid being eyed by the government in a simple way. So that's a good thing than whining over what homeland security does to protect the nation. It is not an inspiring biopic, or a masterpiece, but don't miss it for any cost.P.S. Whatever the form of the governments, the nations won't stop doing what in this film they said was wrong. Because there's no Edward Snowden in every nation to expose it. In that perspective, the US was really embarrassed for their own man letting them down. The China is the number one in this kind of activity. The point is, these things happening right now or not, but should never come to public notice like that happened in here, never should leave the compound. Suppose if we come to know, we will protect, at least in the democratic countries that's what we do. But not to forget it also safeguards us. That means it is like the stars and planets on the sky that we watch and take notes, but they are untouchable. We only monitor them for threats like asteroids and fractionally thinking about the alien invasion.7/10",7,0,7,24 December 2016
Woman in Gold," The fight for the Mona Lisa of Austria.
","Based on the true story of an elderly woman, Maria Atman, who attempt to reclaim her aunt's portrait from the museum of her birthplace. Now she's an old and American citizen, but after her sister's death the possibilities favours her when she meets a young lawyer. So these two sets a journey on one focus, that is to reunite with the family's art. How? That's the story of this beautiful movie to tell.Well, the story was a very good one as inspired by the real, but looks a so simple drama as a film, even the twist and turns. Only if it would have been a better narration, at least in a few important portions, the awards would have been poured on it rather just praises. Anyhow Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds combo were excellent, but individually she ruled and he was a low key performance. Though the overall movie wins with the inspiring characters than the narration.The two different timeline stories edited into one random presentation. One is the past events and the other is the present that reveals simultaneously Maria's struggles. Really, it was better than I thought, one of the best drama with the backdrop of the world war 2. Everyone can't enjoy this flick, but certainly I feel I want to recommend it all.7/10",7,0,0,2 September 2015
Don't Breathe," The right house, but an underestimated person!
","It's a great comeback for the director after his first film, 'Evil Dead' remake had got a mixed response. This film might feel very familiar to you if you have got a good knowledge of the B movies. It was still a very refreshing and very thrilling. The film was short, because there were none segments wasted, it comes to the point quickly. I mean the event, because the story was a one liner, but the event was what this film based on.Three youngsters who rob the houses when the people are out, mark their new target on a blind war veteran. But when it does not go as they have planned, they find trapped inside his house. Struggling to escape from there, they also get so close to what they had come for. Though it becomes a suicidal, and left without any option, what's next for them and the result of their attempt is what becomes the film's conclusion.Really a great effort. Almost a one night based theme with the limited cast. The title is not just what the film revolves, it also for us to hold breath while watching it and most probably sitting on the edge of our seat throughout. But I'm very disappointed with many flaws, or maybe you can say those unexplained stuffs. Like the end seems very silly, because there were lots of evidence to prove the film character had committed a crime, but easily got out. Likewise there are many more, but the film does not explain and I believe there are sure reasons behind them.The writers did not care to waste time on those, because they wanted only a thriller, a non-stop one and they got one. Now it is going to be remade in Kollywood and also a sequel was announced. I expected that when I saw the ending. Maybe, a prequel, though sequel seems more interesting idea after what happened in this. Surely one of the best thriller of the year, so make sure you watch it soon.7/10",7,0,3,24 November 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Only beauty would conquer the beast!
","This is not the first time screen adaptation, that means every one of us have seen either version of the films according to what generation we belong. Mine was the animated one and then there was a modern-day version called 'Beastly'. Not to forget there's a recent French version made on the big scale that I yet to watch. So it's not about the story at all. It is about the quality of film, performances, and particularly how the modern technology used to narrate the story.Like the recent Disney's live-actions 'Cinderella', 'The BFG', 'The Jungle Book' and many more, this is another excellently adapted film from the book. Though visually it tried to be true to the original, and that's absolutely great thinking. Because in this modern world, we all try something new out of the original contents for sometimes to mess it up.Excellent casting, the beauty was the best pick among all. The graphics were awesome. The CGI beast was flawless, yet that usual dark and cloudy atmosphere helped it to be so perfect. Since it is listed under Musical, I was worried about the songs. I truly don't like modern Musicals. But this film was not completely filled with songs. Yes, there were like half a dozen, but good ones. Retained the songs from the 1991 film, and in addition three new were composed.I did not think the Disney would get away with consecutive successes. Great achievement, and their attempts were very precautionary on their every step. Now this is Disney's second highest grossed film ever and first in live-action. The film was for all ages unlike old Disney films. That's the best thing about the modern Disney films that they have adopted. Definitely recommended for at least once watch it.8/10",8,0,1,14 June 2017
Sicario," One of the finest movie about the raids on cartel gangs.
","This was really a great film. Fighting against the drug trafficking was the theme. The story of an FBI agent who was recruited to work in an elite force that no one knows its existence. Their's aim is to tackle the main source, instead to deal with its lower order. Something that impossible to do without international cooperation. Every raid is done in secretively, sometime if required at any cost in whatever effort to stop it. Like I said, this was an awesome movie, and good to see it after the documentary like 'Cartel Land'.The story is kind of hard to detail it out, because it was more an action movie than the talking. How a special force unit goes after the bad guys and stops them is the main plot. But the characters were so distinctive, every main roles had their own agenda for what they are doing and that's how the narration dominated with the high standards.The cast who played them were simply outstanding, including that starts with Emily Blunt, who is someone looks changed the attitude to play physically challenging roles after 'Edge of Tomorrow'. And then Josh Brolin and another one, an upcoming young British actor who I really don't know, but Benicio Del Toro was actually the show stealer.His part was unexpectedly great, totally raw and aggressive. Especially the his end scene, no one could have guessed it, but that's how the way it is. No doubt any top actors would have denied to perform that, anyway well shot with minimum violence, but the intention was very clear as fighting against the dark forces to cut off the head first. One of the best movie of the year, so definitely recommended if you're interested.8½/10",9,1,2,14 February 2016
"McFarland, USA"," It's just a matter of when, one to find his place to fit in.
","Nothing wrong to call it an another version of 'Spare Parts', but it dealt with a different subject. It is a biographical-sport film, about a running race team involving seven high school students from one of the poorest towns in America, McFarland. But the tale begins with the coach Jim White, who finally arrives with his family there after got fired frequently in the other cities. Not intended to stay for a long period, but he has no other choice. He finds hard to fit in the society and get along with his students, but he manages to get going when he forms a team for the upcoming cross-country running race. So their journey puts the small town on the map.A very inspiring film, not just sports personalities, but anyone who wants to achieve in life should see it. So a must see film for the students and the youngsters. It is not just about the sport, but culture and society. The first act was an introduction, where and how everyone comes together was revealed. Followed by the middle part focused more on the game. Getting prepared for it and facing other troubles that stands obstacle to it. And finally in the third act, it kind of loses what originally intended as a theme, but brings the social matter into it before getting back to where it belongs to curtain.There was lots of modification in the cinema version compared to the original story. Characters, locations, events, all were kind of randomised from the actuality to the different timelines just to tell a good story. After all, this is a Disney film and Disney always seeks a decent family theme, yet it still remains true to the real. From the New Zealand director of 'Whale Rider' fame, another brilliant film. Apart from the super Kevin Costner and his family, the rest of the cast was so perfect. One of the best sport-dramas of the year and Disney done it again. You no need to analyse it to choose, just go for it and it won't disappoint you.8/10",8,1,1,24 July 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians' date with the creator.
","The first film was the most unexpected. That was one of the most colourfull space films I have ever seen. Youthful, energetic, fantastic visuals and so the same followed in this sequel as well. Not the same good, but stood to the expectation of the first film's success. This story does not have a great adventure in the galaxy. A simple quest, but a thrilling action-adventure. Now this accidental space gang is set to meet the creator.It's time for Peter to meet his father, Ego. As he still upset with his mother's death, his encounter with his father was not as expectedly smooth. On the other side of the story, Rocket, Yandu, Baby Groot make their escape from the captivity. They all end up on the Ego's planet where the rest of the film going to take place. Being the guardians of the galaxy, their fight against the whoever threaten the safety of the universe once again tested with their strength as a team.James Gunn did it again. And I'm confident that he's going to do the same for next as well. All the actors were fantastic like the previous film. This time, little fun with little Groot. Anybody who loved the first would love it too. Being a franchise from Marvel universe, it is yet to join the 'Avengers'. So far so good. I'm now expecting one of the best of best trilogies.

The story of a farmer family who came across the ocean, but now lives on the edge of the forest after denied permission to build a house in a village. When the newborn baby disappears in a thin air, the family begins to experience the mysterious events. Without a clue about the happenings, the evil force begins to possess them while the unity of the family is tested.Wow, finally a wonderful horror-psychological-thriller. Usually horror films are the worst kind compared with other genres, because most of them overly rely on the sudden sound/noise and gore. But there are many awesome horror films I had liked which were better story than the graphical presentation, like this one. So I love good narration than those try to scare me with make-ups, stunts and sound mixings.It was a limited cast film, sets in a beautiful remote place and the language was awesome that perfectly suits for the horror theme like this. Everyone's performance was brilliant. It is just a one million dollar film and the entire film was shot within a month. The records are not matter when the writing and the direction were top notch. Especially for a first timer it was a remarkable achievement.A simple plot, developed greatly and the suspense was the highlight. Yet viewers expect more explanation, but I'm happy for what it is and it should not go deeper than that which might spoil its unique flavour. Not just horror film fans, everyone should try it if they're capable to handle the slow narration. Finally, like usual, here I won't ask for a sequel, because it'll make an amazing one off film than the dozens of crappy follow ups.8/10",8,0,2,4 June 2016
Jersey Boys," From the streetlight to the spotlight.
","I know who's the director, but not the actors. Maybe that's the reason the film did not do as expected at the box office. But still theirs performances are not forgettable. Every one of them was amazing, they are the real singers and so the jobs done easily. I mean the filmmaking who understood the story and its characters and delivered accordingly. You might have seen many similar biopics and this is almost the same, but still there's lots to inspire from what you see.Since this music genre is different compared to the todays trend in the music industry, this film quite clearly brings back the 50s, 60s eras for us. So that's how this story appeals to its viewers. It was about the four member music band and their journey through the success and struggles for decades. What inspires is that, they are nothing like we see in todays musicians like drugs and sex stuffs. But the story had its share in those things, which might have been a huge for that time.The family, friends and music, the films very beautifully defines the differences. Between professional and personal life, how they lose grips is what obviously we see regularly in all the musician's biopics, but I'm talking about 50 years ago society and lifestyle. The things are different and how they managed or did they is the film to reveal. I really liked it and I wanted to rate higher, but I was bored a bit because it was a very long film. The pace was okay, so I managed and I think it is worth a watch, but only for the selected audience.7/10",7,0,0,14 October 2016
Steve Jobs," Pretty impressive narration, a better version out there for now.
","US film or UK film is not an issue, but the real question was the second movie required? Plenty of films are made in a short period of gap about the same person like 'Infamous' and 'Capote', themes like 'Olympus Has Fallen' and 'White House Down', and sometimes remakes like 'Deaths at a Funeral' from other film industries. So the history says audience accepts only they are different from each other and so this film was, but very very sad it bombed at the box office.Like everybody I was not interested in this, even though it was from a renowned filmmaker. But after watching it now, I felt I was terribly wrong. Actually, this is the best version so far about the Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs. It was entirely a different narration than the previous one, everything was like the backstage drama that takes place before every product launch. That means most of the film was shot in the auditoriums and its corridor, parking lot, rooftop, and other surround places.All the affairs like family, friends, co-founders, business, troubles et cetera are brought into one place and dealt there itself. Surely a very cleverly written screenplay and display by the actors, especially the two Oscars nominee Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslate. Once again Danny Boyle proved his directional skill with this beautiful biopic. I did not LIKE the end scene, but LOVED it. In fact, this film's end and Ashton Kutcher film's opening scenes has a clean follow. I also felt the movie was very honest, but I don't how much since I'm not into the books to learn about the famous personalities. It's not a must see, but definitely worth a try.8/10",8,1,2,24 February 2016
12 Years a Slave," Surviving is the key to the freedom
","It's always interesting to see a movie based on real events. Some of them are breathtaking, so it is but in a heart-wrecking way. It is not like someone who lost at sea for months or someone who trapped on an island for years. It is slavery, very cruel and harsh form of torture that takes one's freedom away.This true story occurred back in 1841, nearly 170 years ago. A New Yorker Solomon Northup, a born-free black American was kidnapped and sold into slavery. So his journey into the dark world begins after he was assigned to work in various fields. It was incredible and unbelievable sad journey of those 12 years till he gets his freedom back.After the movie 'Shame' Steve McQueen retained his favourite actor Michale Fassbender to play in a prominent role for the third time for this historical epic drama. As usual, he became the ambassador to McQueen's movie along with great performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor. The movie was captured in beautiful places of Louisiana. The unknown supporting cast was also given great support with their small roles in the story.It was a good adaptation, but dialogues were very weak. There's no strong lines said anywhere in the movie or any memorable and rememberable. I believed the movie transformed exactly as the book says, I mean the original edition one. This movie is not appreciable for its contents because it was evilfull, but for bringing back the truth to the todays audience. It was acknowledgeable hard work for the cast and crew. So this movie will be recognised in big stages that mean the Oscar is not far away to fetch for McQueen and Chiwetel.",9,3,5,28 February 2014
Sausage Party," The supermarket is their world and uprising to liberate it.
","How many R rated animated films have you seen? This is not a hentai, but the Hollywood's rare animated-adult-comedy. Most of the big names are here, especially the young generation. The film took me by a surprise. I did not know when it was made and what its genre, but the posters made me very curious the with double meaning punchlines. It was a silly story, something like a parody of Pixar's 'Toy Story', but a very enjoyable film as it is a rare product.If you check the last two decade's records, the animation films tore apart the live-action films in the box office clash. It is shocking, but the fact that animations make good revenue. This film is a trend setter in animation genre that targets the adult audience. Like Hollywood found its counterpart from the Japanese hentai. It just cost only $20 million to make and the production quality was not very standard, but acceptable. Hope there will be more like this in the future, but I would seek a sequel for this.Seth Rogen was the main man behind this film. The rest of the cast too was good. Nothing but theirs voice lending made all the difference, especially you would know who were who, while a watch, that kind of familiar it was. The story of supermarket products from all the categories who fight for their freedom.I really enjoyed, it was short too, as well as a fast narration with some good adult jokes. There are a couple of negatives about it, like the first one was there's no innovation in it, like it is very familiar, but a different kind of comedy. And the next one was all the characters, I mean the supermarket products are American. So if you are a non-American, nearly 90 per cent you won't get what those items are. The adults should watch this, because I don't know when you will get another one like this in the future. So I definitely favour it.7/10",7,2,4,4 November 2016
The Wolf of Wall Street," All about Drugs, Sex and Money. The rest was just a glimpse.
","This new Martin Scorsese's movie made me go speechless, I was absolutely stunned. This was not some random person's life story, it was based on the former stockbroker Jordan Belfort which mostly speaks about the frauds he committed. This movie was presented in a dark comedy like it's supposed to be, mainly because of three stuffs it deals, (1) drugs, (2) sex and (3) money.Drugs: It was not the first time a Hollywood movie to represent this issue in raw act, but depends on whose movie it was. When filmmakers choose subjects like this they should ready to roll on any challenge that comes ahead so I believe Martin Scorsese did an exceptional job here to depict the truth as it should be.Sex: It was very strong and kind of shocked to see in a Martin Scorsese movie. Like I said in earlier paragraph no matter what it is the director excelled in this department as well to extract the possible reality.Money: This is a common theme in world cinema so no surprise the director mastered in this field as well without letting anything behind. But previous two themes from above two paragraphs braced this theme very comfortable blend and reached the crest of the tensed end part of the story.Does it require to brief about Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill's contribution. Well, both of them were outstanding in their respective roles. And great supports from second stream actors and cameo appearances from various top profiles. The successful collaboration between Scorsese and DiCaprio continues to the next level. Hope this pair gives an another remarkable product in near future. Until then goodbye from me, I mean meet you in my next review and thank you for reading this. Cheers.",9,1,3,1 April 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," Once upon a time the king Julius Caesar was kidnapped!
","So here's the new film from the Coen brothers. They have become rare in the recent years, I was always checking out what's next for them and now I'm slightly disappointed with this. I enjoyed watching it, it is one of those you want to rate them better, but you can't for some unidentified reasons. According to my analysis why I was not satisfied fully is the story. I mean the narration was rich, performances were phenomenal and music, locations, all were fantastic, but the screenplay was kind of aimless. The beginning, the ending or even in the mid part it had no purpose, but something like a mockumentary about the film industry of the 1950s.With the average screenplay, the directors have shown their magic. Very cool presentation, you would enjoy it if you're theirs films fan. But I don't think all his fans would be pleased enough. This is truly a multi-starrer film, everybody was at their best in their retro characters. If you share your experience with others who also saw it, they might ask who do you liked the most. Probably many would favour Josh Brolin, because he had more priority than others who comes under his belt. But George Clooney and Alden Ehrenreich also have given a good show followed by Scarlett Johansso and Tilda Swinton. The remaining ones as well not bad, but Jonah Hill was completely a waste.Since it is about the film industry and its people, brace yourself for some good laughs. There is variety in it like different genre/theme and multiple layers in the narration. Like from moving to the western to the historical subject and then to the musical and many more. It did good at the box office against its budget, only because of the star power it has and the filmmaker's reputation came in handy. Though I hope the Coen brothers would come back strong with another product and it does not take another 3 years. It is not an award winning film, just a good entertainer, but praisable quality.6/10",6,0,3,14 September 2016
Kong: Skull Island," A new dawn. The King has arrived.
","Seems I'm the only one who did not know it was not a sequel to the 2005 film. The Kong was over a 100 feet tall in this, compared to 25 feet from a decade ago. Being a big fan of that film and Peter Jackson, I hated this idea, especially for totally a fresh cast and crew. So I was not expecting it. Only while watching it, I came to know it was a new version. With a new cinematic, a new set of actors, timeline, completely a different kind of tone for a King Kong film that I have ever seen.They wanted it to be a badass action film than a value added storyline. That does not mean I loved it. It was average. I only enjoyed the nice action-adventures. But the visuals were a more commercialised. I even confused whether did I watched a Hollywood film or an Rajamouli film. You know those terrible methods used for stunt sequences.The most boring part of this film was the same old formula, which is a set of people enter in a dangerous enclosure and only a few come back alive. A couple of scientist escorted by a military to a mystery island hidden in the mists of the South Pacific to do some scientific research. Soon they come to realise they are in a dangerous place where giant monsters live. After losing some of the soldiers, now it becomes a survival game. But the general is obsessed with a revenge. How the rest of the story folds were told with a battle of the film.Basically, this film was created to merge two franchises, the rebooted 'Godzilla' with this one. The post end-credit scene gave some important hint about the future of the franchise. But I thought it was too similar to the comedy flick, 'Journey 2: The Mysterious Island'. Usually spoof films were made out of greatest hit films. But it looks like here a reverse case. Though all the actors were good. Nice direction, visuals, music, particularly the sound effects. This film is simply enjoyable and forgettable.There are many things I did not like. The Peter Jackson film was so artistic. Every frame was like a classic painting. In this, the Kong standing on his two feet, walking around like a man, totally turned me off. The giant ape did not behave like a real ape. Many sequences were also borrowed from many other films, only replaced with different creatures and recreated with a fresh setting. This is a perfect time pass film to have on a weekend. Particularly, if you are a graphile (graphic+phile), you would have a nice time.5.5/10",6,1,1,4 November 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Street pets versus the house pets! A day adventure in a big city!
","Animation films always fascinate me, because of its varieties. Even animals can be the heroes and villains. So this kind of new story perspective, including technology, what makes adults too can enjoy them like the kids does. This is now in the list of top 50 highest grossing films of all time and top 10 of the year 2016. Moreover, it is the highest grossing non Disney and non Pixar animation film. This is a very enjoyable family flick that directed by the 'Despicable Me' famed filmmaker.Kind of similar to 'Bolt', but totally a different experience. This story happens in just one day. It follows a young dog named Max, one day when his owner brings another pet dog, he thinks she does not love him anymore. So to keep his position safe in the house, he strikes a deal by blackmailing his new housemate, Duke. As a revenge act, when Duke tries to get him back, something goes wrong and they get stranded on the street. So getting back to home is their biggest challenge and it should be done before the sun sets. The rest is the Max and Duke's a day adventure in the New York City.I was not expecting a masterpiece, just the last week I saw one, 'Finding Dory'. This is a good entertainer, that has some great names in the voice-over cast. Particularly you will love Kevin Hart like I did. But watch out for his impolite dialogues, if you are watching with your kids. Though there's nothing seriously affecting, just a typical Kevin Hart, but awesome. A simple story, a simple adventure, but very likable characters and screen presentation.From the pets' perspective about during the daytime when their owners and the kids left for the work and school, respectively, how they make their day is what's revealed in this. So the 'Secret Life' means, theirs secret get together and do whatever they want to. But an unexpected clash takes place between the two gangs, the house pets and the street pets. In so many ways, it was better than I anticipated. There are lots of untold stuffs, especially the Duke's past which might be covered in the sequel which is officially announced now. So I'm waiting for the 2018 summer. Meanwhile, watch it if you haven't yet, particularly if you like animation.7/10",7,1,1,14 November 2016
Finding Dory," Before Nemo, a long ago another child got lost in the open ocean...
","Whoa! 200 million dollar film, 1 billion box office collections worldwide. The 27th film to do that so and the 5th animation film. This sequel was made after 13 years, surely a long gab, but 'Finding Nemo' was one of my favourite animations, tell me who does not love it those who love animation. Nevertheless, I liked the idea of having a sequel, but I scared it would go to flop terribly. Now, after watching this, I totally stunned. This is not a greatest animation ever made, but the way the screenplay handled, along with other stuffs, this makes one of the best among its kind.Firstly, when I heard the sequel's title, it made me laugh. Like, whaaaat? Once again the story is going to repeat. I did not think it would bring a big change. Actually, it was a different tale, especially I was not expecting it to be emotional. Tell me how many tearjerker-animation you have seen. Once again the Disney-Pixar jointly did it. I think appreciation must go to the director who also made the original film. Great casting too, I mean the voice- over artists.We know that Dory is severely suffering from the short term remembory (memory) loss. Now this tale is going to reveal her backstory. From her childhood to till she meets Marlin and then Nemo, there was a series of forgotten events. She slowly regains some of those memories and begins her quest to find out more. This is where she gets lost, but the title defines that she was lost before and now looking a way to get back where she really belongs.For me, after 'Frozen', this film is what emotionally got me. The value of having family and friends beautifully disclosed. It might be an animation, but still a meaningful story from many perspectives. Lots of new characters were introduced and those were really cool ones. I expect theirs short animations to make its way about their origins, particularly Hank the octopus and his story about how he lost one of his tentacles.The Oscars is the quarter of a year away, but releasing nominees would come weeks ahead. So it's about time to learn where this one fit in. But I'm anticipating close contest between this, 'Zootopia' and 'Red Turtle'. Coming back to the review, this is a good watch, for everybody, so I highly recommend it. I hope there will be a third film, but like I had felt before this, I desire it and then I'm not sure it would extend its legacy to further. So fingers crossed!9/10",9,3,10,4 November 2016
Arrival," It was a perfect contact, but troubled at the communication.
","The film was decent. Nowadays there are lots of altered versions coming that you won't easily say those are the remakes or reboots or spin- offs or whatever they call them in these days. Like 'Premotheus' to 'Alien', this film can remind you a few titles from the past, but 'Contact' is what the majority of us believes it got inspired.The eight Oscars nominees for the film is insane. I know some people liked it, and the film was good, that does not mean it is an Oscar product. I'm okay with the technical side recognition as it deserved that. So visually it was very good, but not a special effects extravaganza. Just a simple sci-fi drama, with a few thrills, particularly towards the end.When the unexpected visitors from the outer-space land their ships in the twelve different locations on the earth, the humans patiently try to communicate with them to learn their intentions. This story focused on the American soil, where experts are brought in to decode the alien language. How the rest of tale develops was told in the remaining parts.To me it smells like a trilogy. If not, it should be. I enjoyed it, mainly because of being a drama. Sci-fi is always associated with action, adventure and thriller, but this drama was something fresh as per todays computer graphics dominated cinema world. This is particularly for the family and older people like the grownups. Like I said the youngsters love action and violence. So it is a one time viewable film and you will get everything in that attempt itself.7/10",7,2,6,24 February 2017
The Conjuring," So far the horror movie of the year \m/
","From the director of 'Saw' and 'Insidious'. 'The Conjuring' tells the story of the big family and their newly bought house which is haunted by the ghosts. They consult the couple who are the fine paranormal investigators in the country. And the rest of the story follows to prevent the ghost's execution of evil power against living ones.One of the most talked horror movie of the years, in fact lying in the top one of the list in its genre in 2013. I liked this movie for its simplicity, they did not try too many stuffs to make it jam together. The presentation was in chronicle order, the flashbacks would have been spoiled the movie's rhythm, so we must hail the director Wan for that. Yet! another disappointment for me because it was one more horror movie that did not scare me at all. It tells, that is why I am not good at the horror genre. Not because of that I don't believe in negative forces but I like movies like 'Drag me to Hell' and old 'Evil Dead' kinda themes.The positive from the movie was the performances from all. They said it was based on a true story and that is the other top more favour the movie had in its success. This movie still a best compared to other silly horror movie which highly depend on a fine sound editing for scary scenes and graphics to make a ghost. I think you should go for it if you have not seen it yet.8/10",8,1,4,26 October 2013
The Water Diviner," A father with a hope to find his missing sons.
","A fictional narration with the backdrop of the World War I. Precisely the story begins after the end of the war, about a father who goes after look for his sons who were last seen on the battlefield of Gallipoli, Turkey. The rest is the mix of drama, war, romance, flashbacks, and whether his mission is accomplished or not is the climax that decide.Frankly, I was a little disappointed. The story was not based on the real, but looked like one. The point is it was a wonderful and inspiring theme, but direction was not convincing along with bad editing. If you look at who's that, it was a direction debut for Russell Crowe, who played the main character in the film as well. Some of the historical facts were wrong, especially showing the Greeks in the bad light was the negativity of the film. Visually the films do not give the impression of the pre 1920s where the story set in. Instead, it looks more of the late 40s or the early 50s.Since it was set after the war, most of the characters were in a guilt attitude. Can't say whole film was predictable, but the scenes were. The performances were the only things that tried to lift the movie, as well as the music and screenplay in some parts. This, book based movie should have been directed by any top director, not for the freshers to try-out their skills in direction field, because of the powerful stuffs like anti-war elements. One time watchable, but disappointment is ahead of you if you expect greatness from it. Anyway, it was Australia's top gross movie last year in Australia.6.5/10",7,2,5,14 September 2015
Wonder Woman," The Amazonian princess Diana's quest-come-self-discovery!
","From all the superhero films, this was one of the most anticipated. Mainly because of the woman oriented theme. People were desperate to see the solo woman superhero. Today, we have the great visual effects technology, that anything can be possible to bring on to the screen. And actress like Gal Gadot, even better it gets. Yes, it was a wonderful film. A simple storyline, but a well made film.The Amazonians who are cut off from the rest of the world, is preparing for the battle if Ares returns. All these years nothing has happened, but one day a fighter pilot crash on the cost of their island. Then the princess embark a journey back with him to find, and end the Ares threat forever. But she only ends up in the WWII, and what happens in the following sequence are the rest of the film.Who would have done a better job than Patty Jenkins. She nailed it, and so set to direct the sequel too. Even the supporting cast was good. DC's visuals always high standards and so this one. Action sequences too amazing. There's lots of changes in the character, as well as in everything. Firstly a nice superhero costume. And connections like Diana's father, the island, all pretty nicely written out. The DC universe just got extended. I can't wait to see 'Justice League'.8/10",8,12,22,14 November 2017
Straight Outta Compton," The rise of the Rap music!
","There were lots of debate over this film's snub from the Oscars, but I'm not here to talk about that. As a film, it was awesome and as a biographical film, even more awesome, but not an inspiring film that I was expecting. There were many bad things in it, like the language and character portrayals. Though hats off to the filmmakers for rendering the it with the bold contents. I don't know if it being true to the actual events, but anybody can feel how those circumstances would have been for those involved in the real.One thing is for sure, the film is not for the families. The first half was the reason which was very negatively appealed, particularly the racism and police abuse preoccupied rather than telling the actual story. But the next half was much better. I liked it because of that part which crafted so brilliantly. That's where the real journey begins. Well played characters, everybody who repressed those real ones were done incredible job.This film revealed something I did know. Like how the Rap music got so popular. I quite belong to the same generation where this thing got its revolution. It was like another 'Lords of Dogtown' where the young guys made skateboards popular, but here it was the Rap songs. It was a two and half hour long film, longer than an average film length, but the pace was good. Except the strong contents, the narration never looked dull. I totally enjoyed watching it, a good film for adults, particularly those who love Rap music must not think of missing it.7/10",7,4,20,24 September 2016
The Wolverine," A little beautiful diversion of tale from actual 'X-men'
","The smartest thing the filmmakers did was taking the character Logan to the abroad. With all the new faces around the movie looked very well refreshed like we do in desktop and laptop. Except few minutes in the beginning rest of the story takes place in Japan. Even the story had connection with Nagasaki's atom bomb incident. The incident was very finely blended with this sixth installment of the 'X-Men' movie series.It won't tell this movie has connections with other 'X-Men' movies except his hallucinations of 'First Class's end incident. The character Logan is the only one who derived from it and tells his story when he was held prisoner in Japan during the world war two. He saves a young soldier Yashida from the nuke blast. After many years the Logan was requested to visit dying him to say the one final goodbye. But the war begins when enemies try to abduct Yashida's granddaughter who is a new CEO of his tech corporation. It forces Logan to fight Yakuzas and ninjas where his mutant power will be tested.Everyone around me liked the 'First Class' but for me it was just okay. In fact 'X-Men' movies were never been my kinda movie, as a die hard movie fan I enjoyed the marvelous visual effects. Like I said the advantage was the atmosphere in the story with all the new casts. While you are engaged to see Logan fighting the bad guys, the story takes a quick turn and brings the twist and I did know it was coming. This movie was totally fresh and unique from all the previous movies, just like I wanted. It was not a massive fight movie with highly influenced by the mutant's magical stuffs but it had its own and sufficient stunt sequences that one can enjoy.7.5/10",8,1,3,28 November 2013
The Croods," After ICE AGE now it's time to explore into STONE AGE
","So far the best animation of 2013. After 'Ice Age' now it's time to explore into another world 'Stone Age'. It was the story of a caveman family that is set in the time of the stone age. I never thought the Nicolas Case suit for an animation character, I am surprised, he was the best and his voice perfectly synced with one.According to the movie everything were not logic in the movie and one should not be bothered about it. The species that comes in the movie were fused with each other and kinda worked for the story. The movie was simply enjoyable, I had so much fun, the Crood family was awesome. The story was very simple, it was all about adventurous journey of a family to escape the disaster.You know teenage daughter and her over caring father never compromise for anything in life. In this movie they always fight each others, one of parenting rights and other for the freedom to experience new stuffs. Like most of the story, boy meets girl here too two young people meet but kinda fairly avoided the romance. Of course there will be always one geek brother and a annoying little sister and a disgusting granny and a mother who always listens to her hubby.In those I have seen 2013s animated movies it was the best pick, many are yet to release. A movie can be enjoyed with family and kids. A must see for animation movie fans and I highly recommend it.9/10",9,0,0,19 September 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Know your enemy's weakness before challenging to a fight!
","It is known that critics have no brain. It is the best Superman film as Henry Cavill in the red and blue suit. Yep, I know it is always DC versus Marvel, so it is then DC's reply to the 'Avengers'. I don't care their rivalries, as a film fanatic, I enjoy good films and I found it was so good. But I was a bit worried after the Superman was shown in a dark shade in the trailer, especially after Batwan was overly stylised by Nolan, I thought the black suit would take over. After watching the film I was relieved and happy that Batman was exposed.Batman fans might have been disappointed, but for the superhero and DC fans, this film is a great treat. You can't compare it with 'Avengers', it had its own style. It follows the 'Man of Steel' and directed by the same director. Excellent cast. I have never been the Ben Affleck hater, so I had no objection to his role in this. He did good along with Cavill and others. He would do better in his solo Batman films if Zack Snyder is retained to script and direct them.I'm not a comic book reader, so I did not know the story before the watch. I was surprised for the Wonder Woman's part in the film. The visuals were awesome, the story was unpredictable, well developed characters, cleverly composed scenes, wonderful stunt sequences and the film's overall tone was kind of dark and gloomy, a very satisfying superhero film. The content balance was perfect, but the characters did not do the same as we know Superman is a father of all superheroes.I already watched it twice and I can't wait for its sequel. Especially looking forward for Jesse Eisenberg, because he was kind of stayed low in this and I hope his character Lex becomes much stronger. It is a PG13, and there's nothing botherable stuffs in it for the underage audience, but I felt it is targeted for adults because of the matured flavour. Don't think about that I said, just watch it, it will definitely entertain you well if not blow you away. Surely recommended to all.8/10",8,3,4,14 July 2016
Monsters University," Back to the school....
","OMG, we waited ten long years for a sequel and they gave an astonishing movie. When 'Monster Inc' came, that was the time of the beginning of the new era in filmdom of 3 dimensional (3D) animation movies. I remember I liked it but my 'understanding of a movie' was par below then compared to now. So I feel I liked this movie more than the first and that is normal because it happens to most of the people.'Monsters University' was the prequel to the 'Monster Inc' where it exposes the college lives of Mike and Sullivan. Mike had a dream ambition from his childhood. When his school takes him for the trip to power plant called 'monsters, incorporation', he wants to join the MU to become scarier like them. In other side, James Sullivan, the son of Bill Sullivan, the scarer joins the same university. Mike and Sullivan challenge each others and when something goes wrong they have to join hands to make everything back to normal. Now they have to face a series of challenges together and overcome it to achieve their destination.Since the storyline is about the college life the movie was a perfect entertainer even for the adults. It was just like seeing the two movies 'American Pie' and '3 Idiots' together at once. But the big problem was, the plot was not fresh, it was inspired from various teen movies that deals about college lives. Other than that the movie had lots of fun as expected and also the sentiments in various stages. Wow, for the moment I felt like 'do I am watching an animation or a live action movie?'. In my opinion adults will love this movie more than children do.So far the best animation of the year, even slightly ahead of 'The Croods'. I want this movie to win the Oscar, now let wait for the nomination to announce. But I still believe this movie do lots of magic in upcoming American Academy Awards. And I wish all the best for the cast and crew. A must-must see movie if you like teen themes, college stories and animations.9/10",9,0,0,26 October 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," A tale about the pre-production of musical-children movie 'Mary Poppins'
","This is not the first time I saw a movie about the behind the making of a masterpiece works. Recent 'Hitchcock' described 'the man of mystery', Alfred Hitchcock's career best movie 'Psycho'. Johnny Depp's 'Finding Neverland' tells about behind the creation of a magical land and Peter Pan. So there are many other movies about theme like this. This movie is as well based on such kinda story which unleashes creation of the most celebrated musical-children movie 'Mary Poppins' from its book.Characters like the author of 'Mary Poppins' book, Travers played by Emma Thompson and Walt Disney played by Tom Hanks filled the screen with interesting moments of history. Especially the cultural differences between two countries, England and United States brought lots of humorous scenes to us. The story telling splits into two where one briefs the author's real life incident when she was a child lived in Australia. And another one was about Walt Disney's struggle by the threats from Travers, while being adapted the book into a movie.Both the characters, Travers and Disney had an uncompromising relationship in the story. Where Travers was fighting not to go wrong in the movie adaptation because the characters from her book means a lot to her. On the other hand, Disney's fight to keep what he promised to his children to make a movie from their favourite book. One of the best movie of the year. Tom Hanks was okay in a role of 'father of animation'. But I was impressed with the Emma Thompson and also the Collin Ferrell. Paul Giamatti's role was small but wonderfully portrayed. No wonder why this movie got nominated for 2014 Oscar in the music section. Was expecting it to win but failed to do, so sad.",9,0,1,4 March 2014
Son of Saul," Experiencing what Saul's seeing, hearing and undertaking.
","The World War II is the largest source supplier for the war movies. I have seen numerous breathtaking braverism, as well as heartbreakingly suffering film characters which are based on the real and sometimes fiction. The genre too differs, from action, adventure, war to the comedy, romance, drama et cetera. Since the Academy Awards nominee announcement in the January I had an eye on this, but now it had won the Oscars that draw my interest even more on this. Anyway, finally saw this, so let me tell you what I feel about it.It is no ones biopic, but inspired by a collection of testimonies of those who had made out alive from the Auschwitz. Like some of the WWII films, it is very unique, that focused on a particular event and a person. Saul is one of the prisoners in the Nazi held concentration camp who is a slave-labour. His job is to clean the place after prisoners were executed. One day he finds a young boy who was executed and soon he takes the responsibility to give him a proper burial. Risking his own life and others, he begins to find a rabbi to perform the last rites. So what happens later and how it ends is the remaining film.It is not only enthralling story, but was very clever and unique filmmaking. In this whole film you will see one face at all the time in different angles and mostly they're close shots. Yes, Saul is everywhere, the camera never takes off its lens out of him. We would experience what he sees, listening and undertaking, more like in the real time. Just like a computer game where everything is from our (player's) angle, but here it is us again barely through the Saul's perspective. (Something like the upcoming Hollywood film 'Hardcore Henry' trailer I saw.)Although, the movies are not the games, like I felt weird during watching 'Need for Speed', when Aaron Paul was at my place. And a movie always needs a character that can take us to the journey through the time and space where it sets, otherwise it will be called a documentary film. The aspect ratio was like the older day films which is narrow that takes time for us to get used to it, yet it is a colour film. More like the entire story is taking place within the 48 hours. Interesting pace and developments, and a decent conclusion. I think it deserved all the praise and prizes given to it.'You have forsaken the living for the dead.'I know the seriousness of the film and its contents, but I could not avoid the laugh at the end scene. I did not want to, but I did it without my self-awareness after seeing the Saul's face. I hope, there are others too, like me in that situation. Yet the storyline was very strong, like how far would a man can go knowing the life is meaningless after what he's going through. That makes him to take a solo mission when others are struggling and working together for their freedom.Since I don't know any language that spoken in the movie, I had no problem too to follow the movie. The 1944 settings were so realistic, I think everyone's hard-work was this film's result. All the performances were excellent, especially who played the Saul's role. That is the face no one is going to forget who had watched this film. However the real hero of the film was not the actors or the writers and the director, but the cameraman. Like I said earlier, he had done a brilliant job. If anyone wants to praise this film, he/she must begin with him. The cinematography award at the Oscars might have went to 'The Revenant', but the cameraman award is none other than this guy who shot this film.I really liked this film, but not overly sympathised or enjoyed. Usually if any movie that's based on the real gets my favour, even the movie has been low quality with more than ignorable flaws. Because telling the truth to the world is what I consider is foremost important than trying to get benefit out of it. But when it's not factual, I expect whatever the cinematical options can make it a better product.This film comes between them both, but leans mostly on the truth about the World War II prison camp. An insight of what the prisoners have went through. Painful to watch a movie like this, at a time I appreciate the filmmakers for giving this film and let the younger generation know a tiny dot of the incident of the WWII. To watch this film, no one needs a reason. It is automatically a must see, but after watching it, whether you liked it or not is an individual opinion.7/10",7,0,4,4 May 2016
Thor: The Dark World," Not too bad, not too good
","I begin by saying in a simple line, this sequel was just okay for me. I did not find any awesomeness in it or any mind blowing scenes. The first movie was quite interested me because of a new actor, new superhero character and the birth of the new franchise from Marvel studio. All together with a mythical Greek character in a modern world, it was something that hit me. Just a few months back, I praised Hemsworth for his best ever performance in the biographical picture 'Rush'. Here he has fallen back to okay kinda performance. The movie was nothing special, but a decent entertainment. Technically, it was rich in visuals with good graphics, no one must dare to doubt it. My problem was the story which followed the usual fantasy movie protocol. One of the disappointment from 2013, completely a commercial purpose behind its creation and production. Yeah, all the movie are but this one is very much visible. So in my opinion, it is one time watch movie.6.5/10",7,0,0,15 February 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," I just found it better than the first...
","Whatever you say I am not a big fan of this franchise. I did not like much the first installment other than a decent entertainment. So this was another 'let it go' movie from me. But when the time came to see it, I was a little surprised of being better than the first. The second hour was good and before one was a mild slow. The real interest is the, follow-up movies from here on. The end of this part created a curiosity for the next movies of the series. Looks like it would be very interesting with big changes in story than first two.The movie series supposed to be a trilogy, but you know it tasted big commercial success that mean big buck in filmmakers pocket. In 2013 this movie was the highest gross from north America. So like 'Deathly Hollows' and 'Breaking Dawn' this franchise following the same path by breaking the third volume into two. Whatever, I am expecting the third and the fourth movies 'Mockingjay part I and II' would have more exciting than previous movies with many twists and turns.It was so sad to hear about Philip Seymour's sudden tragic demise. His best parts are yet to come in the next movies of the movie series. The franchise told they wrapped most of his portions of the last two volumes and now they decided to make minor changes in his character. That's good to hear, hope he it will be an unforgettable show from the great actor.The end scene before the credits roll the logo of 'Catching Fire' changes into 'Mockingjay'. It was awesome, I just sensed some great is ahead. So like teenagers, it interested me and created curiosity. Looks like I got reason to watch 'Mockingjay' movies.7.5/10",8,2,15,7 February 2014
Godzilla," He's taller, bigger and stronger. The king of the monsters is back.
","You know I had expected this movie a lot, after all it is one of my favourite movie characters ever since '98. Excited after seeing first teaser. But I was little unhappy over model of Godzilla, which was more outdated. I mean the blueprint for creating monster was borrowed from '54 version. Which was originally a man with costume performed stunts then later played it on a big screen where actors performed their act in front of it. Now everything is different, we got the technology, then why should choose fat one rather update it with fine anatomical structure. Because usually water animals won't be a fat one. That is why '98 Godzilla looked so perfect with slim and long legs just like an enlarged version of Iguana. Other than not redesigned 3D model, the Godzilla was presented awesomely on the screen with the great visual effects and sounds mixing. I loved to witness it on a large silver screen, it was stunning.The movie began with a few opening credits and a decent story till forwarded all the way to later 15 years. The boring portions started. Wanted for something to happen somewhere, but had no luck. It only teased me with some sudden loud noises and briskly camera panning away from the characters just what the monster appeared from nowhere, but it didn't. I think the human story and monster's did not synch in with a clean perfect one movie. Humans and monsters were completely parted. At least collision between them would have been very interested, just like the car and helicopter chase in the '98 version.All the human characters were very weak including army general, the protagonist and his silly mission. I wanted a gutsy person like Stephen Lang, who was excellent in 'Avatar' as a lieutenant colonel. You gonna love the graphic side of the movie, but this story badly misses the rockstar characters like one from Ron Perlman for 'Pacific Rim' and Jean Reno for '98 'Godzilla'. Aaron Johnson was good, but not good enough to handle whole movie himself. The inclusion of another couple of well know actors would have helped better in my opinion. Maybe the surprise entries are kept for a sequel, I guess.Like any other Godzilla fan, I fought for my ticket that I booked a day earlier and saw on the first day itself. Actually, I enjoyed a lot this movie, but it will never be my favourite Monster movie. 'Favourite' and 'good entertainer' are two different categories. All the good entertainers are not my favourite. Though I cherished this film in a few scenes. Most importantly, this movie making opportunity was landed on the pair of a good hand. I liked 'Monsters', the director shown his caliber in that low budget high quality movie. So I had faith in him, but the thing was he's a documentary style movie maker. I was wondering how this commercial movie gonna shape up. Well, he proved that he can pull the trigger of the bazooka as well. It was visible that he was given freedom to make his way, at least in the majority of the movie.''Let them fight.''Must agree this is the best version according to the appearance of the monster. So the credits must go to all the members of special effects and visual effects team. No doubt stunts were breathtaking. It was a 2 hour movie, in that first half was dragged with human drama that I did not like much. It was drifting away from the main picture. So I was lucky in the exact beginning of the second half where the 'king of the monsters' appears in front of us completely with a huge roar. There's another flying monster in the movie called Muto. This second hour is all about them fighting each other. In a couple of the scenes I was totally disappointed where the fights between them were smartly concealed other than showing us through cable news channels and in few other tricky ways. Well, they saved it for the final battle. I guess it was a little late, but in some way it convinces us to satisfy after a long wait.During the final battle something did not look good. I thought Godzilla was an animal, suddenly he becomes very intelligent and uses his fire-breath in a particular position to defeat his enemy. That's not at all, walking back to the sea was kind of looked like a Disney's fairy tale concept. Because monsters should behave like one not like one of a Marvel's superhero who concerns for human safety. That is the portion made me think like is it a children's movie? Because I just saw it till the end without aware. That small mistake was one of a drawback in the movie. They desperately wanted it for a sequel and so they did it without harming humans around.There's a generation gap, fighting over different version won't change anything. My favourite version will remain the same and so yours and others. The purpose of all versions is to entertain the audience and so it does. As far now my review was mixed respond with a bit slides toward the negative side. In one line to say what's the wrong with this movie is that human portion of the story was a big letdown, though the vfx tried its best to lift is as much it can.Overall, I believe repeat viewing this movie won't help us to love it. The first impression is the best, if you got it, then fine, if not, so you must be either '98 or '54 version fan. If you are a Godzilla fan then it is a must see movie whether you like it or not. Put all your faith and take a chance, who knows you may like it better than me.7.5/10",8,3,6,18 May 2014
Life," Their historic discovery was not celebratable.
","As I mentioned many times before, now is the trend of the space exploration in films. So there were many films like this one, but not all of them are received well. It was a decent flick, if you consider from the real world aspect, but definitely a very nice entertainer. Very tense plot, especially in the second half till the final scene.This is a minimal cast film and the entire story takes place in an Internation Space Station in the Earth orbit with a lab facility. They've come from Mars with a soil sample to study for any sign of life. Their historic discovery does not become a happy event as they encounter life threatening trouble on-board. The remaining is to focus their rest of the mission that how it'll end.This is the second film with the same name I've seen in the recent time. The other one was a biographical-drama starring Robert Pattison, but this is an sci-fi-thriller. Lots of big names in it, but the film did not make that kind of a big buzz. It was considered a good fictional space film. Kind of inspired by other similar themed flicks.Lots of thrills, fast paced narration, a simple story with the nice visuals. From the Swedish director of 'Easy Money' fame. There were lots of speculations about its connection with other films. But nothing was confirmed by the filmmakers. I hope there will be a sequel, but this time it won't be same as the story might take place in a different setting. Overall, I enjoyed it and surely would suggest it if anybody asks me.7/10",7,3,6,4 July 2017
What We Do in the Shadows," The video document of the life of the vampires.
","A documentary style horror comedy based on the short film of the same name by the same directors. I would say it is an interview with the vampires in the Kiwi style. The film follows a group of vampires living in an old mansion and their everyday routine, including how they manage to get blood and confrontation with other mutants are documented.Definitely a wonderful comedy, but feels like a mix of 'Dark Shadows' and 'Addams Family'. The title implies the nightlife of these creatures, especially adapting the modern way of lifestyle. So their exploration begins here for their video document. Being different is how much struggle is what the film focused. Threats from various quarters and getting over from every disastrous event is revealed.Quite an interesting vampire film with the awesome characters and of course the entire film was shot in the dark time. It is not a cliché, but just a spoof of the typical vampire theme. Cleverly written screenplay and direction with the well supported performances. Looks like many people had loved it, I'm slightly on the different side that I enjoyed watching it but did not like much. Because I have seen better film in the similar concept. So I still recommend it because it is worth a watch.6/10",6,0,0,14 July 2016
Deadpool," So this guy in the red suit came and broke some records...
","I was not a Deadpool fan and I'm still not, but like any superhero films I'd pleasure watching it. The other reason was, we had other superheroes in our time, so this guy is kind of new to me. It was a stunning launch to the big screen for the Deadpool as well as for this new director. This film was merely an introduction tale than a fully stretched story. Like how a human becomes a mutant and later who seeks a revenge for ruining his natural life. But it yet to explain a couple of things and I hope it all will be revealed in its sequel.I am happy for Ryan Reynolds to get another chance, because his previous comic book character did not received well. I certainly liked the film, but nowadays there are plenty of superheroes to choose, in that, Deadpool's not in my top 5. So I am happy he joined the 'X- Men', because I never liked the boring 'X-Men' films or its characters, but I do love its spin off 'Wolverine'. I'll definitely look forward for his solo films like 'Wolverine'.This film broke a few records like the best box office so far for an 'X-Men' installment. A short film with the present and flashback narration shared the screen piece by piece alternatively. This was a strong R rated film so far I have seen in a superhero theme and there were plenty of other films referred. No offense to the people who liked it (and those who are going watch will do the same), but in my personal opinion it was a bit over-celebrated.6½/10",7,2,9,14 May 2016
The Hangover Part III," They have learnt lessons so no more parties
","The fun continues, is it! yeah, kinda. This third Hangover was a different one to the other two movies. There were no more bachelor parties, looked like have they (movie characters) learnt the lessons so. But still the movie had a similar track jokes like pursuing something to get away from another thing. So there's no short for fun but the story was not greater like earlier two.Yes I enjoyed the movie from comedy aspect but the roles played by the cast, I was little not favour to it. I mean the Bradley Cooper now a big star than what he was when the first hangover movie came. Whenever I see him in this movie I though he was forced to do the role in the movie as he was part of the earlier installments. So there's no surprise this movie is going to end with this third part.Everyone performed equally good in all the three movies. But Zach Galifianakis was the highlight in all the three while Justin Bartha was the disappointment. No doubt, it is now one of a best comedy trilogy and I can recommend it to anyone if somebody asks for a good dude's comedy theme in near future. Sad that they decided to end the franchise with this but in another angle it feels that was the best option than dragging it to nowhere and making audiences especially 'The hangover' series fans to sloppy.Like I said the story was told in not the usual stream but we know the trademark of hangover movies so the movie ends with a style. Still I am curious about the fourth from the bean it spelled during the middle of the credit and I am hungry for that as a detailed explanation in a movie. I know you won't love it as much those you loved first two but still worth a watch as it was the grand finale to the trilogy.7/10",7,0,1,26 September 2013
Honey," How simple, charming dance flick it is.
","One of the first films in the revolution of modern dance flicks, though I know I saw it too late. Nowadays there are many films are coming out since the younger generation showing very interest in the dance. I especially don't know how 'Step Up' made a successful franchise, but the sixth is on the way.Honey is a main character's name played by Jessica Alba. A passionate dance, choreographer, when her dream coming to true that hits a roadblock for some reason followed by other issues. So now she has to come up with a solution to solve all the problems and that's the film tells how she overcomes them all at once.A simple story, even the choreography was ordinary, but not a bad film. I anticipated Alba to give a show that not to forget for the decades. This is now obviously a decade old flick and disappointed with her character, especially with her dance moves. But young Alba in a sexy pose on the poster, no one can just ignore it from watching.Overall, I enjoyed it. Since I'm watching it delayed, I should not compare it to the present scenario. Even though it has been only 13 years, in which all the fields rapidly advanced, so the dance. I suggest you just go for it with an empty mind if you want to see it. Soon I'm going to catch up with its sequel, but I know it won't be as decent as this one.6/10",6,0,0,14 June 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," All eyes on him and all guns pointed at him.
","It was not an attracting title for a sequel. The first film was good, completely an unexpected, but I was expecting this one, even though not as much as I was excited to see 'Jack Reacher 2'. That film was good, but did not meet with its first film's merit. And this sequel, really amazing. One of best follow-up flick and better than the original. That feat considered very rare in cinema and here is the one.Entirely different than the first. I meant the storyline. A new action, a new adventure, and even on a bigger scale. Though the initial parts were average. I totally disliked that killing assignment Mr. Wick took in his hand, but what followed after made the film great, definitely not to be missed for that alone. Especially if you are an ardent action film fan. For me, that reminded me 'Kill Bill', but they are not the same kind, except the fighting concept with hundreds.Continued from a couple of days later where the previous narration had ended. Now the retired assassin, John Wick forced to take a final job, but soon he finds he was backstabbed. Every eye on the town on him and every gun pointing at him, there's no way he could get out of it easily. So, he has to fight them all, just in order to survive. Then what comes later are even more aggressive screenplay that's ends with left open the door for the third film.Now this became a stylish franchise. That's what happens when a stuntman takes up the directional job for an action flick. He did not write it, but he knew exactly how to create them, technically perfectly. Besides, he got wonderful, dedicated actors to achieve that. Not just Reeves, but all were awesome. Believe the third film would be a kick-ass, particularly the pace that could match with likes 'Crank'. Just watch it already and be prepared for the next, the mega finale.8/10",8,0,2,4 September 2017
Inside Llewyn Davis," Believe me it is not your regular movie but looks like one!
","No doubt it was a good movie with fine characters and great story. This movie reminds one of my favourite movie of recent time 'Frances Ha'. Because both the main characters from these two movies are more alike. Theirs professional struggle and also chronicles relationship problems.This, Coen brothers latest created lots of noise before hitting the screen. Like everyone I too expected what they gonna give to us. I enjoyed it. The folk songs were so good and it was not nominated for Oscar because most of them were not original. According to the filmmakers, especially the music section was inspired by 70s, but not the lyrics.Beautiful cinematography, very eye catching colour palette. It was on the short list for Oscar, but lost to the magnum Opus 'Gravity'. I was rooting for any of these two in this category for Academy awards.I think Carey Mulligan is used to it with a character like this, an anti-good roles or an irritable one. In a recent 'The Great Gatsby' as well she was in such role. But I like her, she's the one of a beauty that Hollywood imported from Britain.The only trouble the movie gave me was the tease in many parts. It teased me with its scenes when I expected something it went opposite direction made me look like a fool. Yeah, it was good thinking by the Coen brothers as the script writers, but I felt a little let down when they carried away throughout. In the end the buzz they created did not end in what everyone could expect. I don't know it is good or bad, but the movie will win our hearts. Believe it is not your regular movie, but looks like one, that is the trick made by the legendary brothers. If you like sentiments with a low amount of its contents and realistic characters, then it will be your movie to have a peek inside.",8,0,2,4 March 2014
Spectre," Not your usual Bond movie, but still a good entertainer.
","What I liked from a couple of last Bond movies was they were off the regular 007 style, like not overly rely on spy's special gadgets. This change has been since the day one of Daniel Craig as a famous British spy, James Bond. Anyway, he's the most fittest (muscular) Bond I've ever seen and he's celebrating 10 year anniversary with this film release. But the question is whether he to do another film or done with the franchise. The doubt after the confusing end of this film.The end was quite clear on the story perspective, so I kind of felt it was a farewell for Craig. But, later I came to know that the official source says Bond25 will be his fifth and so on till he opts out himself. 'Spectre' was a very simple Bond movie I have ever seen, but I can say the production quality was so good that you can't resist the enjoyment. The actors, they were also good, but not as I anticipated. Maybe many scenes were very ordinary for a Bond movie, that's comparable with the nowadays action movies, otherwise it was not as bad as critics expressing their disappointment.You can't believe what I was disappointed, you know when they say what the C stands for - is that the best word they come up with against the M for Moron? Anyway, James Bond movies have always had ups and downs, the last film 'Skyfall' was a mega hit and now this has not stood up to that standard. But very entertaining with all the actions and unexpected turns in the narration. As a spy movie, it was okay, but as a Bond movie is what might upset you, so its upto you how you look at it. But to be honest, I enjoyed it.7/10",7,2,4,14 February 2016
Joy," A small accident can lead to a great achievement, but difficult path is certain.
","It is a semi-biographical film about a person who invented a modern hygienic mop. So all the depicted events and characters were partially real, but for the cinematic reason they have been fairly altered for a good outcome. And yes, I loved it. A very inspiring film among all the Oscars nominees this year. In some way I also felt Jennifer Lawrence should have got the award for her fine character display.Honestly, I was not interested in this, so I wanted to get over it silently as soon as possible. But I ended up enjoying a lot and instantly it became one of my favourites of the 2015. What I expected after watching its trailer was like I judged it by its cover. As I hesitated in the earlier, but strangely now I'm recommending it to all.The story of a woman who grew up listening her grandmother's motivational speeches. But realises the life is tougher than she thought and making a living is very competitive. After so many struggles in the life, she finally invents something that changes her and her family fortune forever. But like any new initiative does face, the problems arise and how she is going to fix them is what the remaining film narrates.A very interesting film in the perspective of the career option. Forget the doctors, engineers, lawyers and those who're settled in their lives with a good job in hand that pays big, but there are billions of people, to them it will definitely serve as an inspiration to ignite their future.The rating for this looks like a fair value, but still a very underrated film everywhere. Amazing actors, a little funny and a little emotional, but a very impressive film directed by the one who bought the Oscars to Jennifer Lawrence for their earlier venture together. I don't know what's between her and Bradley Cooper, but looks like their on screen chemistry is doing something big impact. This is their's fourth project together and second with the director, so I hope they do more in the future as well. This is really a wonderful film, so don't miss it.8.5/10",9,2,4,14 June 2016
Her," Beauty and sexy is not seen, it's heard and felt.
","I love this director's all the movies. If you check them out you would do same as me. Because his movies were not based on usual concepts, that something immensely varying from each others. Sadly, he's not consistent in filmmaking, he does take large gaps between the movies otherwise he would have been one of the most talked director in Hollywood beside other giants. The fact is I did not know it was his till I decided to watch and that made so curious towards the time I going to spend for it.Joaquin Phoenix was spot on in the movie. Man, I still remember him in the movie 'Gladiator' where he appeared in a dark shade. I was only so young and I hated him in that role. Now everything has changed, in the last few years he's coming stronger, especially after 'Walk the Line' and 'The Master' which gave him the Oscar node. He's famous for his unique display of the roles in his all the movies and this movie is not too far from another top notch performance. Yeah, way to go Joaquin Phoenix.This movie dealt with one of the rare subjects that set in the 2025. We don't know how will be the future look like, but the director created remarkable fictional world and inserted equally outstanding character(s). This was the story of a man called Theodore, a loner and a professional letter writer. One day he decides to buy the newly released operating system with artificial intelligence. He begins to encounter the life changing experience and instantly fall in love with it. In the world of reality it is impossible to have a physical relationship with an AI, so how far it goes and ends is explained in the movie's death.Absolutely an extraordinary concept, but the only thing that did not stand up to my expectation was the story. It was predictable, but the scenes created for those stories were finely patched throughout. Really, it amazed me. Makes me happy that it won for 'original screenplay' at the Oscars. I know it was too late that I am seeing it, actually I'd seen all the Oscars movies of the year except this one and now everything was done and dusted. So I have to wait for another 6 months for another shot. Between that guess the movies that's going to have a chance for the upcoming Oscars. As for this movie's concern, it is not a missable. So recommend it, if you have not checked it out do it as soon as possible. Cheers!",8,0,2,2 June 2014
The Nice Guys," An unexpected and thoroughly entertained retro comedy!
","It all began from this year's Oscars, I saw this pair for the first time and I knew its their film promotion strategy. So I went to look for the full details and I thought I'll end up as another silly comedy like 'Daddy's Home'. That's why I did not bother to check it out its teaser and trailer, but now I feel terrible for my crappy judgement. Because this was an awesome movie, definitely not just in the comedy category, but overall one of the best films of the year and it should be in everybody's top ten or twenty and nothing less.It is a retro type film that takes place in the late 70s, LA. Where two private investigators unlikely come together to probe a mysteriously reappeared porn star from the dead as what her aunt says. But later that connects with another high profile missing girl case and so with all the leads, these two goes the length risking their lives to solve it. The remaining story reveals whether they succeed or end up as the losers.It was from the director of 'Iron Man 3' who wrote it keeping in mind as a television series, but later turned into this beautiful comedy. The first thing is I loved the Ryan and Russell's performances. They totally nailed it, especially Ryan Gosling in many comedy scenes. I think I laughed a lot and better after a long time. That's a surprise, you know, I did not think they can do comedies, but they're beyond all the praising words.It's not just two of them, there is a mini 'Nancy Drew Reporter' kind of character. A teen girl joins them in the investigation and her part as well had a great impact on the narration. You would think you can predict the story, but it is a well written screenplay with many twists. Everybody did their job so well, even the two hours did not look too long, but went very quick. The cast, crew, production, all must return for a sequel and I hope it will happen very soon. A must see film, but for the grown ups only.8/10",8,2,5,24 August 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," On the battlefront, his intention was to save the lives.
","The film was awesome, mainly because of the good message it carried out. That's not it, the film was well made with the wonderful cast and their great performances. The special effects were top notch, as well as the location where the majority of the second half takes place. This is a US-Australian co-production. Mel Gibson returned to the director's chair with a bang after exactly a decade. It got six Oscars nominees, so let's wait and see how many awards it grabs.It was the World War II theme, based on a real person and events. It tells the story of an American youngster named Desmond Doss, who joins the army to contribute to his nation. But for his religious point of view, he struggles during the training. After managing to make through, the remaining film focused to reveal his bravery on the battlefield against the Japanese armed forces at Okinawa in a place called Hacsaw Ridge.The story was based on one of the ten commandments. Doss, who strongly believes in that carries the same ideology to the combat zone. But all the initial part of the film reflects why he is very on to it. Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield.He did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed. In the first place he would have not joined the army if he's true to the commandment. That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it.He was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation. Only if you think all his episodes from an atheist perspective, that's how you would feel. One of the major reasons for that is, when he saves his men by letting his enemy die. But appreciable effort, at least from the Americans perspective. A true hero for his nation. One of the best war films ever. Instead of saying a must see film, I would say don't miss it.7.5/10",8,2,4,14 February 2017
Warcraft," One fights for their new home and the others to defend theirs.
","I never played Warcraft game in my life, nor read comic book, but I enjoyed this new fantasy universe. Azeroth is the world where this story takes place. When the Orcs planet was destroyed, they use a magic portal to get to Azeroth and make a safe home. But that is where humans and other intelligent species live peacefully. A new race means a new conflict to solve the differences. So the battle commences at no time to gain the power to rule the land. Between the two great powers, who wins is the film to tell us in the rest of the parts.It was something like 'Avatar' and 'The Lost of the Rings' coming together. Despite having alien race, it is very much an action- fantasy film, not a sci-fi. From the games to film, it was awesomely made which is obviously a latest trend in the filmmaking. The graphics were good, but not perfect, and that's fine, because it succeeds to give the game look than the realistic one. I think that's the point, otherwise no disgrace to call it was inspired by the games or comic book.I know it is not a masterpiece like 'The Lord of the Rings', but there's a promise like the quality and story and its characters. There's no big names, but these actors who are known mostly for their supporting roles has given their best. Like I said I'm new to this Warcraft universe, so I don't know anything outside this film, but I'm kind of neutral on the war between the humans and orcs. Because one's world was destroyed and they're seeking a new home and the other ones are defending theirs. So everything makes sense from both the perspectives for their actions.This is just a beginning, there's lot more sequels to come. Though, it's a pity that it failed in America, the native product, but internationally proved it is one of best of its kind, I mean games to screen adaptation. The director of 'Source Code' did a great job and all the actors, including those motion-capture artists. I missed Zoe Saldana in this, to be as another blue or green skinned alien specie, instead Paula Patton did well in a similar role. The character name also very similar to the one from 'Guardian of the Galaxy'. I know it's going to get even bigger in the follow-up, so I can't wait for it. Hope it will release in less than couple of years.8/10",8,0,0,14 October 2016
Me Before You," Changing one's fixed mind is not an easy task.
","Based on the novel of the same name, directed by a new lady filmmaker. This British film has two young sensation Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke in the important roles. The story of a young man who was paralysed recently meets his new caretaker. Initially they both won't fit for each other, but after some time everything changes when they together do some outdoor activities. While the film progress, it only gets more emotional. Besides, it's fun watching the first two acts, particularly the performances from both the lead strikes strongly.After a very long time I watched a good tearjerker, but not that strong. It is a simple story, there's no big adventure or romance in it. That's right, it is not a romance film and if you decide to watch expecting one, you will be definitely disappointed. Also slightly it delivers a bad message like the negativity for being one seriously ill and alive. This issue is only on the humanity ground, but afterall everyone entitled to do what they want, because it's their life.Anyway, the film avoids the usual cliché. Like there's no scene that you had seen in other similar theme repeats here. Deliberately avoided to make it a fresh piece. Basically, if you observe closely the both two lead characters, they had a different agenda about their life. Particularly the caretaker never ever tried anything seriously to accomplish her undertaking.On the other hand, those parts were very realistic, but still gives us a cinematic experience due to the fancy screen presentation. Surely a good watch, I think everyone should watch it, because there's no drugs, sexes or nudes or even the strong kissing scenes. Only the main theme is something disturbing, particularly for the tender-hearted people. Other than that, I hope you watch it if you haven't yet.7/10",7,1,1,4 October 2016
13 Hours," In an unfriendly environment they got 13 long hours to survive and resist the attack.
","It is an action-thriller-war version of the 'Argo'. Based on the true story where the most of the film was the 13 hour long armed battle event took place in Libya, 2012. I remember the middle-east's protest over the western films, this story is set in the same time when the Islamic terrorists targeted the American diplomatic compounds in Benghazi, but six brave men stood and fought against the uprising.It is an American patriotic film, but because of the hatred over their own countrymen Michael Bay, they're surely missing a nearly a war masterpiece. The rest of the world saw it as a fine film and appreciated that. If you haven't seen it yet, I say just don't ignore it. It was a well made realistic war film, the actors were amazing and the scenes were suspenseful to spectacular. Definitely one of the best in this theme.It was simply focused on the armed conflict between the two forces, so it won't reasons out us how and where it all began, because that might take another film to tell the tale. That's really a very clever writing. In this 150 minute long film, the first act was full of characters and story development. Then begins the gun fight that commences from the dust hours till the dawn breaks out. With many twists in the narration during confrontation, surely not a film to be missed.8/10",8,2,9,24 June 2016
Sully," When a real human bravery wasn't appreciated till the computers confirmed it.
","Another excellent biographical drama for Tom Hanks in the title role. He has transformed from captain Phillips to captain Sully. Another great addition to Clint Eastwood's filmography as well, he never disappoints us. This film was based on the real event of the January 15, 2009. When a US passenger plane got hit by birds just after the take off, losing both the engines, landed on the New York's Hudson river. So the film reveals the heroic event, as well as followed by the investigation of the crash landing.As it is a Hollywood film what should I expect, another American bravery? Yep, but still a good film, very engaging plot. It's not all about the plane event, because I thought one of the film poster is a spoiler. So the film covers more story, about the drama surrounding the main event. Especially saving the lives, that inspires even for the outside Americans. The entire narration is about two-three day affair, but most of the film was about the crash landing. From the actors to the visuals, all were top class. One of the best biopic that's not based on one's whole life, but one heroic attempt which will be remembered him and this film for forever.8/10",8,0,0,14 December 2016
Alien: Covenant," Good robot! Bad robot!
","After some gaps, the 'Alien' franchise came alive with the prequel 'Prometheum' which originally said to be a spin-off. Particularly, it landed in the hands of the original maker. Now, even the original title back in action. It's another prequel, hence the prequel series on the making. The next film too will be the same kind, before the overall storyline in the franchise align in a straight line.I enjoyed it. But not as good as 'Prometheum' or the first two 'Alien' films. The issue with it was, the same old cliché. There's nothing in the story. It was like any space film that's set in a similar fashion. The 80 per cent of the film was what we had seen in the earlier 'Alien' films. Just altered scenes with a new cast and a great visuals. So the update makes it the special.The story focused too much on the robot. The alien parts were reduced. Because it was like the first appearance of the original aliens we saw in the old films. Precisely to say, the origins. Genetic modification, crossbreeding, there comes the beast. From this film what I have learnt was, it was nothing but more or less the same old fear the humans have about that the robots which are the ones going to make humans go extinct. Except here the aliens come between them. Hence, falling prey to the same clichéd theme from any sci-fi that had humanoid.Nevertheless, well maintained film in its balance coming from previous hits in the series and going forward to bring more hits. This flick would serve as a fine bridge between them. So only 18 years to go between this, from 2104 to 2122. I'm already anticipating the next film. As I have heard, that film would be focused more on the robot. That's going to be a different experience. Fassbender's time to have some space adventures.7/10",7,0,4,13 October 2017
