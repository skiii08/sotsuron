Ali," Ali... we're no closer to understanding him.
","I'm sure when Michael Mann walked off set he made a good film, but in the version I saw there was no fluidity. I suppose it's a case of a 4/5 hour film time being cut down to under 3 hours.Will Smith (without make up) is Will Smith! You can't see Ali. A fatter bloke should have played the corner man 'Boudein'. Also the haircut on 'Gerry Quarry' was superb ! I was hoping his hair would spin round on his head.Where was Ken Norton, or for that matter Henry Cooper or Joe Bugner! We never got to know Ali....why he became a boxer? did he love it.. or hate it. Would he kill a man in the ring, if he had to?",5,0,2,26 September 2005
