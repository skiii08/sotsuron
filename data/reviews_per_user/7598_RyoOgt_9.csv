Captain Phillips," What is the solution of anarchy?
","This is the story about American ship which is hijacked by the Somalian pirates.
You can know the situation of Somalia by wathching it.
To tell the truth,I didn't know what it is like in Somalia before watching it but after watching it,I know the fact that the country is in anarchial state.Description of the story which is based on true events is one of the effective way to have people to know history and situation of the world.
In this movie one of the pirates told the captain Philips the difficulty of finding way to live in Somalia unlike America.I learned that it is important to loss cut if it is needed to do so.To achieve it, it is important to recognize the situation objectively and to throw away useless pride which diturb us to take a benefit.Anyway this movie is worth watching.",8,0,0,17 September 2019
127 Hours," I need help
","Main character goes to the valley and he dropped into the gap between the rock and his arm is caught in the rocks.Image of this film is so beautiful but the storyline is awful.
The man is selfish and while his life he has being acted as he has wanted to do.
He notices important thing when he was 28 at great expense.
He regrets his behavior in the past.After watching the movie I feel that it is important to take advice before being alone.
At the same he keeps taking his pride though the situation is so hard.I suggest to watch this movie to all who doesn't want to people.This film might prompt to notice important thing.",8,0,1,14 August 2019
The Shining," Everyone Might Be Him
","This film is classified into the horror but every people might be Jack Nicholson.
That is the point this movie is popular among many people.
It depict fiction but when we watch it we feel as if it might be happen in the real word.The story is simple.Jack Nicholson working at the hotel with his wife and son for 5 month in Winter.
The hotel is isolated and there were cursed.Jack Nicholson become crazy in the situation I wrote above and his wife and son is frightened by him.
If he communicate with the people being outside, sometimes go out from the hotel, his stress doesn't builds up.Being objective is to keep the mental normal and to be objective we need a hobby, the people who can tell everything, another place and people which enable us to back from the working time.After watching this movie I strongly feel it is important to release the stress regularly.",9,0,0,19 August 2019
The Intouchables," We all have heart anytime.
","Two men are complemented each other.
This movie is worth to watch because it discrive the difficulty of caring doable person. In japan the number of people who is caring isn't enough. I learn that one of the most important thing when caring someone treated him/her is not doing as poor he/she is. We all have the instinct and dignity.To live, it is important to have both and if the former is too strong, we are laughed by others but latter is too strong we can't feel happy as human.In the story they learn to have them from each other. Now a days the technology enable us to communicate a lot of people and it also has the risk to regard the people as information.
Treating the people as creature who have the dignity is the basic but easy to forget because of the prejudice that we know from many media.
After watching this movie I want to keep treating the person without any prejudice in mind.",9,0,1,15 August 2019
Yesterday," It isn't Enough To Be Kind
","The man of this film sing a song as if he made it by original,but they are the beatle's song and the people around him are't know that fact in the story.The subject of this film is that being honesty is most important to live.
Many people wants to have a wealth and honor and the way of getting them is
important.Especially when we create something to imitate is needed.At the same time we have to keep the people not to notice the origin.This film tells us that it is safer for us to keep in mind that other people know the things more than we know.It is easy to say that to be honesty is important but to be succeeded is also large motivation to act something. In this film the man is loved by girl after getting popular.If he was just kind man she wouldn't love him.So his way of getting popular has significant meaning for his kindness for her.It means that he isn't just kind man.There are innumerable way of living we can choose and if we are forced to loose one of them we still can choose another one.And it may be better than one of we lost to chose. Today could be better than yesterday as long as we are honesty.",7,0,0,20 November 2019
Joker," Tragedy Can People Laugh
","This film's feature is that connecting the comic charactor to the social problems that
we are forced in the real word. It has worth seeing because it isn't only changing comic into the movie but also adding the janalism. I think this is one of the reason that it atracts range type of the people.After watching this film I notice that this movie is R designation not only because of
the violence scene but it describe the desire all the people have in their mind under
the miserable situation like Arthur and might agree with riot.
In Japan there was Akihabara massacre in 2008 and that incident has the structure similar to this film. People want the person who speak or act what they want to do but being prohibitted to do so. The person who had acted for some kinds of people is regarded as charisma. In this film the scene of the moment Joker is born, it seems he becomes him.What can we do to stop arising the joker? I think one of the way is to make a place for the people who have nothig to lose except for the prison.For example industry of the art and IT can have the role.They have the potential for make Arthur not only to help but also give the hope to success.For example the goverment make computer that people can use free internet in the Gotham city.",7,2,6,28 October 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," Action is Determined by the Background
","Intelligent people are hardly explored by their emotions.
Lector is a man who is so intelligent and he has a penetrating insight.
Dialog between Claris and Lector becomes more interesting when Lector asks Claris her background.
Obiously, he has interest in her because of her beauty and honesty.
This suggestion is concluded by the scene he explore for her because of one incident.
Claris is too wise and was able to get help from the people.
Her attitude for work and beauty attract people.To summerize this movie teaches us a lot of things.
One of the things which we can learn are the words that 'We begin by coveting what we see every
day'
This also means we can't covet from what we don't usually see.
Concentrating on becoming a better version of yourself and to achieve your dream is one of the important things to have a good life.
one of the important things to send a good life.Anyway, Lector's intelligence and Claris' beauty are strong features of this movie.",10,0,2,24 July 2019
Moon," The space is dark.
","Almost all of the scean, there isn't bgm and it has us to imagine what it is like to be in the moon alone. After I watch this movie I confirm the importance of having relationship with people, and if we are forced to the crisis that we can't overcome we feel nothing. Music help our emotion to live.Anyway, moon is the place to see from the earth at night but visit. When you see it not only you can feel the beauty of it but you should recognize how happy you are living on the earth!",2,0,2,3 October 2019
Slumdog Millionaire," Indian dream
