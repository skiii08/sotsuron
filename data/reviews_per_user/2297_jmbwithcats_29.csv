Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Better then vol 1 but still disappointing
","Yes, I found this movie ended as a complete rip off to the Jet Li film Kiss of the Dragon, and that was disappointing to me, in the film's defense, I was glad the movie was a more traditional martial arts film then vol1, Carradeine, and Thurman were incredible, and the movie was watchable and oftentimes, enjoyable.  Vol 1 was a pen and ink drawing with little detail just outlining Vol 2 was made to color it in and add some detail... I think they accomplished this very well. Overall a good film.  I loved Samuel Jackson as the wedding organist :)",6,2,3,19 April 2004
The Sound of Music," Earns every Oscar
","The Sound of Music (1965)For all the liberties made to historical accuracy, I think it goes without saying, a movie is being made, and without certain poetic license, the bird of genius cannot fly, so leeway must be given... and in so doing here, a truly important and beautiful result is made. Captain Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) stone intensity as a disciplinarian who has forgotten how to love, who has lost his inner music after the death of his wife, is softened and freed through the inspiring lightness of Maria's (Julie Andrews) enchanting entrance into he and his seven children's life as the house's new Governess... While the leads balance each other, the sweetness of the music is equally balanced by the sobriety of the situation in which they find themselves, during the Nazi occupation of Austria. What intrigues me is that in the song '16 Going on 17' the young boy Rolf who appears to be in love with Leisl warns her of being seduced by men, but in the end it is he who is seduced, by the Nazis... and it is so often the case in life that while teaching others we grow cocky and forget that we too are still students, and capable of falling prey to our own folly... We also must understand though, even as the Von Trapp family escapes over the Alps to Freedom (the truth is they fled by train during the day to Italy), that those who helped them may not get off so lightly even though it is unshown in the film... the nuns who would obviously be recognized as having helped them by removing the car's carburetor, the man at the festival would likely be found complicit in helping them escape, and I mention them because it is impossible not to think of those who gave their lives to help so many escape the Nazis tyranny, and now it is our turn to help new refugees escape tyranny... the more that things change, the more they stay the same... I am an emotional person, and connecting emotionally with characters does help enjoyment, but also confirms bias and dilutes objectivity for sure... but ultimately, I believe The Sound of Music earns all five of its Oscars.The Amazon film ends with a one-hour behind the scenes look into the film and the Von Trapp family hosted by Julie Andrews. A perfect way to end the film.And like Maria, like Julie Andrews, my life is truly eased through singing my music, so perhaps as a singer, as a Jew, I relate quite intimately with the story.And it is true as is sung in the movie, and I leave you with that idea now... 'My heart will be blessed with the sound of music. And I'll sing once more.'",10,5,6,1 January 2016
Stop-Loss," Cliché for the uninformed
","Objectively as a person who reviews thousands of films, I have to say this was a terrible movie.On the one hand, while I knew about stop loss already as everyone who signs the dotted line does, I found it to be unconstitutional as a concept.On the other hand, this movie was pure propaganda from bleeding hearts. It has the clichés running straight through it from start to finish, and it wouldn't have been so bad if the directing, script, dialog were any good.I think the actors did a decent job with what they had to work with, and there were some intriguing ideas, but they weren't new ones and they weren't done skillfully.In the end we wonder what he learned if anything from his actions. It seems it was all full of sound and fury signifying nothing.If you want to see my favorite movie about war, watch The Deer Hunter. Now that's a movie that will change your life.",6,3,4,1 February 2014
Friday Night Lights," Hope Comes Alive on Friday Nights
","Well, I'm not from Texas, or play football, or really particularly love football. Hell, I barely like it. When i went to see this movie, I didn't even know it was a movie about football. But, honestly, this allows me to be the most unbiased type of critic. I went in with a totally open mind.Friday Night Lights was to me was lifting the magnifying glass, not only a small and backward town, that put winning above winners. Aggrandizing the image over the substance, but about ourselves. It took me under football's skin, to the blood, sweat, and tears, in a real way. I felt the pressure, I felt the hits, the uncertainty, the fragile youth, that comes and goes so fast. And I was moved.I think at one point, we become anesthetized by Hollywood. And we start to keep predisposed outcomes -- but that's not reality. Reality is, the kids who tried, and failed, and yet, didn't fail at all. Because they learned a deeper truth. We see that when the QB smiles at the end, something he never does.Because they grow, we are inspired. Enlightenment is contagious. I cried, I laughed - one scene the two other head coaches, who tend to stalk BBT around town, hounding him about winning State - threatens not so subtly, the coach before driving away. The daughter then says, 'Are we going to move again?' Mom says, 'No, baby.' And immediately after, in a matter-of-fact manner Billy Bob says, 'It's possible...' I laughed out loud at that. I never expected to see such a myriad of emotional layers opened up. The sociology, mentality, reality, of this film was beautifully depicted with gracious character development, that was all too realistic. Remember the comment on the Odessa radio station after the game when the guy suggested that they lost because they are in school learning too much. The fact of the matter is very few athletes go on to play in college and graduate and a fraction of them go on to play professionally, and a fraction of them make a good living out of it. Odessa put football on a higher pedestal than education and the town and all its residents suffer. Fact is perfect is different things to different people, and this is a perfect story.I believe every scene was necessary in developing the main characters and the story being told.",8,0,2,27 January 2008
Citizen Kane," The Underlying Myth of the Every Man
","This review is part serious and at times frivolous in the enjoyment of the film, but it is my account, and I am deeply moved by this film after having seen it now in it's entirety.Rating 10/10 There is so much history behind this film.The light that goes out perhaps indicating we may not enter so hastily, but as the light slowly returns alight, perhaps we may gain entry slowly, through the passage of this film? One must be reminded of Coleridge's famous poem, Xanadu which is not only quoted here but recreated in flesh, like an edifice of archetypal power and myth.What's unfortunate about the film is the huge empty space between Charlie as a child and after he takes over the family empire.What makes Charlie the way he is? What drives him? What are his ideals and where did he learn them? Why does he demand his wife to sing? Why was Emily so quick to believe Gettys and not stand by her own husband? And would there not be some liability after the fact and hearing concerning the libelous blackmail by Getty? It all seemed too easy, too simple and unrealistic. Why do they hole up in Xanadu when they can do anything they want.Then it hit me, Susan is one of the unicorns from Candy Mountain... and I have the proof! First, Candy Mountain Charlie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5im0Ssyyus Note that every time the unicorn says Charlie! it sounds exactly like Susan. Also note when Susan says Goodbye Charlie it's just like when the unicorn says goodbye to Charlie at the end of the video.That aside, the review continues.Why is it the single thing Charles Foster Kane recalls in his demise is rosebud? It is the word of a man who has never truly loved another, or found a deeper truth in their life and that is truly sad. For what is a man that he gain the entire world but lose his own soul? The missing piece that of Rosebud is perhaps the innocence of youth, that folly of being a child when ignorance is bliss, and we still believe in the illusions set before us and our vision is of magical things and high ideals.Perhaps we all have our Rosebuds, and in the end our memories are either upheld, values restored daily in our endeavors, or they are lost the smoke and dust of our forgotten and meaningless lives.Now even though there is much left unstated, I have to admit this is a brilliant and important movie, one which tells a story of not just one man, but of all mankind.",10,0,1,21 June 2007
Cloverfield," USA's Godzilla
","I personally did not think I would relate with the characters or feel immersed in their situation or stories, but I did. The dialog was incredibly off the cuff and realistic, the relationships very easy to relate to right down to the love interest with Beth. Perhaps at that age many of us were in love with a girl like Beth who got away. But I digress.I thought this movie was incredible, and hopefully it will have a sequel but of course the sequel would not use the same hand cam reality format, but rather a straight sequel to continue the story. It would not make sense to make another film using the same techniques, but a sequel would definitely help to bring out more of the story and answer questions people will have about what they witnessed in Cloverfield.The way i saw it, it was perfectly designed, but there will have to be a sequel, in which case the film will be very different, obviously no hand cam, but it was set up to be a very personal video the kind that so many kids are into right now, its what drives myspace, and youtube, etc... its really what this generation is all about, talking about our lives with video, and thats why Abrams did it. To reach out to that audience who could relate. Hud was the voice that carried us through the movie, but like Dante's Virgil he can only take us to the gates of Hell, and now that our characters are there, so our guide has left us alone, but the monster is still with us.Perhaps Cloverfield is Hollywood's response to Japan's Godzilla, and if so... we can expect to see more films to follow up and expand on the story. After all it worked for Godzilla, but Godzilla was a very charismatic monster, and only time will tell if our new monster has the staying power of a Godzilla.The problem some are having with the camera surviving the way it did, through all that destruction, is a cautionary tale. That we have made some amazing advances in technology. We can make hand cams that can survive the apocalypse in a word, but we cannot save ourselves. Perhaps it shows a deeper understanding that we are off our path, that we have lost sight of what really matters, and what it really means to be human. I look forward to seeing a sequel and hope one will be forthcoming, the monster looked pretty sweet especially near the end.J.J. Abrams is the master of symbolism, as lovers of the series 'LOST' will agree, and I knew this movie would not be any different. So I took special care to notice every detail and consider the importance. For those who couldn't care less, you can stop reading now I honestly find no fault with this film. Though it really has to have a sequel, it just HAS to.So, what were some of the symbols that stood out to me? Cloverfield is perhaps our symbol of terrorism in a post 9/11 world just as 'In part, Godzilla is a symbol of the atomic bomb and the tragedy that befell Japan in the final days of the war. But in part Godzilla is a symbol of Japan's future, and its reconstruction into a newly technologized power following the war,' said Allison, chairman of Duke's cultural anthropology department.The first big one was Sephora, the name on the first building they stop at after the bridge collapse.Sephora written on a wall with black lines.Sephora in Hebrew means bird, and Sephira is singular for the spheres of the tree of life in the kabbalah, and the black line in the tree of life represents the tail end of the abyss, or the dark night of the soul.So you have the bridge, and abyss between the two realms of existence. The bridge has been destroyed, there is no escape, no exit as shown by the sign in the subway we focus on quite clearly. The time is 3:16AM, biblical reference John 3:16.JJ Abrams loves detail and references like this, anyone who watches LOST will attest to that.The first three Sephiroth, called the Supernal Sephiroth, are considered to be the primordial energies of the universe. The next stages of evolution on the Tree of Life are considered to exist beyond a space on the tree, between the Supernals and the other Sephiroth, called the Abyss, because their levels of being are so distinct from each other that they appear to exist in two totally different realities. The Supernal Sephiroth exist on a plane of divine energy. This is why another correspondence for Binah is the idea of suffering, because the Supernal Maternal energy gives birth to a world that is inherently excluded from that Divine Union.The Tree of Life does not only speak of the origins of the physical universe out of the unimaginable, but also of man's place in the universe.Not a well thought out idea here but it's all that comes to mind and though I'm probably just over thinking it, J.J. Abrams has a tendency to delve very deeply into the construct of his films.When Ben places a call in the subway to mother in the subway, it's 3:16 in the morning... possible biblical reference? Also in the subway, closeups of the sign that reads 'NO EXIT'.. perhaps foreshadowing, or simply a simple truth that we are all mortal.The empty carriage being pulled by the white horses... perhaps the pale horse of Death in Revelations.Saturday May 23, 6:42 AM 3 days before Memorial Day Apr 27 6:17PM",7,1,4,23 January 2008
Hotel Rwanda," One of the Greatest Films Of All Time
","'History Never Repeats, I tell myself before I goto sleep.' - The Stranglers But it's a lie, and he knows it as well as you or I do.Watching the footage the mind rebels. I think to myself, that's so mean they're hitting these defenseless people, young, old, women, children. But they're not hitting them, they're striking them with machetes until they're dead. The atrocities are simply too unreal, and one must imagine God if there is a God, is in his Heaven, and crying.We talk of love, but will never understand what love is until our love extends to the whole world.Hotel Rwanda 10/10",8,1,2,28 March 2005
Crash," A chronicle of events when it all goes wrong.
","Everything about CRASH is woven masterfully with a beautiful cast crafted together with sublime chemistry, which often fails in movies where a lot of A-list actors are put together in one film, helped together with the right camera-work, music, and pacing.The movie entertained. It moved. It did what any good movie does. It makes one look within.Pretty honest look at how humans fail and falter, stumble and crawl just trying to get home. Maybe God should have given us some kind of instruction book and I don't mean the Bible. Maybe a wristwatch two-way radio to an angel. The thing is there is no easy answer.",7,3,7,5 September 2005
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Keep off the Grass
","If you wonder why I titled this commentary the way I did.. it's because I attempted here to convey the subtle satire the only way I knew how.. not by explaining what it is, not by defining comedic concepts, but with a friendly satirical greeting.I think one thing worth nothing is, if one person does not like this film, it does not necessarily mean they did not get the humor, or they are stupid or whatever you want to judge them as being.. perhaps they just didn't like the film... to say any movie is bad, or wrong, invites narrow minded criticism. One must state what it is about a film they liked or disliked, therefore those with opposing views can understand what is causing the difference of opinion. I'm watching the movie Dr Strangelove, and I will not say anything yet... My personal head space is subjective and filters the movie thru my own set of discriminating beliefs to result in my opinion and personal view of the film. I would not say the film is great, I would not say the film is horrible, I would not define the film as not great or not horrible.How I react or respond changes in time. Today I might not like this film, tomorrow I may get something from it I did not yesterday. As I change so do my beliefs. I respect the cast of this film, and historically am aware this is Kubrick's first and only satire, which to me says something right there. Kubrick being one of the greatest film directors of all time - in my opinion. In fact he is so well respected I feel I don't even have to say it is my opinion, it is nearly a fact. But, I say it is my opinion anyways, to keep unbiased.
So with no further ado I will give my personal opinion of Dr Strangelove, taking into account everything I just noted above at length:
This movie is awesome :) I laughed my ass off. nadir writes 'There are probably over a 1000 comedy movies better than this e.g. 'The Party', 'Very Bad Things', '50 first Dates', 'National Security', 'American Pie trilogy', 'Starsky & Hutch', 'Punch Drunk Love', 'Money Talks', 'Go', 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', 'The Gods Must Be Crazy 1 & 2' & 'Spaceballs' to name a few. From the 44 minutes of what i had seen of the movie i would have to give this movie a 2/10.'and I wonder if their post is complete satire.. as they mention films that are not even comedies.  50 first dates wasn't a comedy.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest could never be classified as a comedy.  American Pie, Starsky and hutch even considered as the best comedies of all time? Well, you can see where this is going.  I am discrediting this person's commentary, and as you can see, it doesn't take any effort to accomplish.Having seen all the movies Nadir mentions, as well as most likely quite a few they haven't,  from Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, to James Stewart onwards to the contemporary... I can say with a certain amount  of experience, that George C Scott, Peter Sellers, were genius in this film. Remember, in comedy there are things we need to  become attuned to.. how attuned we are to true comedy, begins with the superficial, and deepens to the subtle, to the improvised, to the satirical...  George Scott gets the best lines, but Peter Seller's carries the film. Remember, when standing on the shoulder's of giants, it's best to not  hit your head on a satellite.",9,1,3,21 July 2004
Life of Pi," captures the way myths are created
","OK so I just finished watching, and thought it was a profoundly beautiful movie that captures the way myths are created, and the truths they hide, and beautiful... so did the tiger exist? I think ultimately no, there was no tiger, no orangutans, no hyena, and no zebra, like he says there's the mundane story, the forms... of the sailor, the cook, his mother and himself... but that only tells the physical and emotional story... the spiritual story is told by the boy, the tiger, the orangutans, the hyena and the zebra.... one feels the profound love and loss as they are in the heart, and not just in the distant mediocrity of detached relationships... this elevates the film to great heights and depths... and I could not say I found it wanting in any way... How do you explain any love or loss? You can't just say it in words, you have to paint a picture... and that's what the boy and the tiger represented, an ability to be inspired and not destroyed by simple human pettiness.",10,1,4,16 July 2014
Corpse Bride," Could've Been A Contender...
","Corpse Bride had the potential to be truly a wonderful, heart wrenching tale, but wound up just too short and undeveloped to make it happen. The movie cries out for another chapter and sadly we are denied. With a running time of 75 minutes though there isn't any room for substantial development which is unfortunate.The character Emily had so much heart and her one contribution musically had some nice lyrics, though overall I found the songs lacking other then the piano piece which was terrific but doled out in too few increments. CB lacked the cuteness, the wit, the humor and charisma of Nightmare Before Christmas, and the potential in glimpses we get here and there are merely teases in a movie that ends up feeling like a mismanaged script, rushed out the door with too little clothes on.The ending was also rushed and the butterfly sequence not as strong as it could have been if we were given more time to fall in love with Emily. She had potential and we do get those glimpses like I said, but too few and far between.The beginning starts off rather cliché, but at midpoint picks up in a story twist that is fantastic if you didn't know it was coming, worth watching but I felt more tantalized then gratified.",7,1,4,26 September 2005
The Orphanage," Beautifully Tragic
","While Orfanato is reminiscent of other films, The Dark for example, Orfanato ends on a note reminiscent of Japan's original Dark Water. Where a mother must make the ultimate sacrifice to care for the lost children, who are not just lost to this life, but this world. And while Dark Water is an exceptional film in this regard, it is a daughter ultimately who is left behind and not a husband. But either way, the heart wrenching remains, and magnificently does it echo long after the curtain falls.Orfanato is a little slow, but it is a spectacular film for those willing to immerse themselves in the story as it unfolds.At one point we might imagine that the boy had hidden away in the secret room in the closet, only to get locked in by the mother's own hand when returning the metal supports which propped against the secret door, the ghostly knockings being the son trying to get it, ultimately to die there in what became his tomb. At the moment the mother finds the hidden passage, and the body of Simon and screams out, it seems in a flashback it occurs to her what happened to her son who had been missing for so long.And yet so many other strange happenings suggest something dark and treacherous is going on as well but are they really or is it all perception? We have the medium who comes to the house, we see the children in the end, and so we are left with 2 possible outcomes to the story.One in which the son gets accidentally locked under the stairs and dies, only to be found much later by mom who realizing what she did, takes pills to commit suicide and throws herself into the ocean.Or two, she slips into the other world to care for the children beyond this life.Whichever way you choose to look at it, this movie was fantastic. Comepelling, beautiful, haunting, not all that scary mind you, but enticing enough to keep you wondering, and a very nicely developed story.",8,5,8,9 April 2008
Monsters vs. Aliens," REALD CINEMA shows us what's coming
","3-D technology has really taken leaps and bounds recently with the development of REALD CINEMA. No longer do you need those flimsy red and blue glasses, it's all done in the projection now, and eventually you'll have cut-to-size 3D compatibility with Iphones and Home Computers, in fact by the end of this year.The movie begins with some exceptional 3-D, and any movie that features music by Journey can really do no more (Who's Crying Now? plays in the car when the probe comes to Earth). You might remember Journey has a song that plays during the credits of the 1982 film, TRON, sequel to come out in 2011. While playing cards we hear the song, 'Reminiscing' by Little River Band, a song recorded in 1978.Overall the film is cute, enjoyable by adults and kids alike with some really silly moments to keep you watching. The war room scenes remind me of Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove. This president keeps wanting to resort to nuclear war as a solution, and his general wants to resort to using monsters which have been kept under guard at Area 51 since the 1950's, holding an arsenal of monsters captured over the years, some you might recall.Of whose voices which are played by some of my favorite actors including, Reese Witherspoon as Susan Murphy / Ginormica (Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman), the joke is that she's only 49' 11' tall, Seth Rogen as B.O.B. (The Blob), Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. (The Fly), and Will Arnett as The Missing Link (Creature From The Black Lagoon).It was also a joy to hear Keifer Sutherland, Wil Arnett, Rainn Wilson, Paul Judd, and Stephen Colbert as POTUS.I'd recommend seeing it, but remember that now that 3D is on a hot streak and we've truly perfected this craft, expect to see more and better films to come.",5,0,2,2 April 2009
The Exorcist," The One True Horror Film
","In 1973, a comedy writer and a car-chase director got together to tell a psychological mystery, based on an actual incident the writer heard of when he was in divinity school.Yeah, sounds like a real thrill-a-minute.Every studio passed. When Warner finally gave in, the writer/producer seemed to go out of his way to do everything wrong. He hired priests to play themselves. He hired a 40-year-old to be an 80-year-old. The female lead went to a virtual unknown, and the male lead was given to a Pulitzer Prize winning playwright who originally thought he was being hired to write the script. The professionally composed score was literally thrown out the window, and replaced by bits and pieces of obscure music. A maniacal director was allowed to torture and terrorize the cast. A barefoot illiterate peasant was hired to do the sound effects.During the first showing, the producers were certain they'd blown it when a large part of the audience walked out.They debated whether to release the film at all, and some studio chiefs considered it an obscene embarrassment. But as they left the theater, they noticed something odd.Every single member of the audience, including the walk- outs, was still in the parking lot. Not one person had driven home. They were gathered in a huge mob, discussing and debating and arguing about what they'd just seen.In the following months, the results were unprecedented. In New York, the joke was that you had to get in line in New Jersey. Today, we would call them 'Star Wars' crowds.But 'The Exorcist' came first.Like 'Citizen Kane' or '2001: A Space Odyssey', it is one of those rare moments in film history when someone does something totally different, yet somehow, by luck or sixth sense or divine guidance, seems to know exactly what to do.Right from the start, the off-rhythm pounding of the Iraqi blacksmiths gets under our skin, a beautifully subtle way of suggesting something is not right with the world's heartbeat.The indecipherable right-to-left Arabic writing also plays a role here, a relatively strange sight to American audiences, and a prelude to the backwards speech, backwards heads, and backwards nature in scenes to come. Reversal and conflict are constantly reinforced thematically, through juxtapositions of incompatible images: the sacred and the profane, the light and the dark, the natural and the unnatural. But it's not all subtlety. The prologue sequence ends with a heroic shot straight out of High Noon, as the exorcist suddenly finds himself face to face with the statue of a grinning, reptilian demon. Human flesh against indestructible stone.Then a marvelous transition. Old to new. From Iraq to Georgetown. A movie actress switches on a light in a dark bedroom. And the sound of rats in the attic, even though the home's caretaker insists quite believably, 'No rats.' Scampering rats. Shrieking gulls. Lions devouring prey.All the sound effects are chosen with a merciless attention to human instinctive psychology. They set the stage for evil.Science alongside superstition. As a young girl becomes progressively sicker, her behavior ever more bizarre, there seems little difference between a medical laboratory, with its bloodletting and its whirling x-ray machines, and the rituals of a witchdoctor. We meet our young hero, the suffering priest/psychiatrist, further blurring the line between magic and reality. And he brings in yet another paradoxical combination: faith, and the loss of faith. By the way, his name is Karass, which is Greek for 'cross'. At least I think it is. Anyway, it should be.The film's most powerful oxymoron is undoubtedly the most shocking, most horrible scene in the history of cinema. It makes one inescapable point. This is not a disease. This is not a dream. This is not even a lower-echelon evil spirit from some haunted house movie. Only the Devil can do this.An interesting sidebar. During this scene, Ellen Burstyn is supposed to be sent flying by a vicious backhand blow. Of course, this was before the era of digital wizardry, so she had to be physically strapped into a harness and then pulled across the room. As the rehearsals wore on, she warned director Friedkin that she was starting to get hurt. Friedkin agreed that the next take would be more gentle. He lied.He covertly instructed the special effects designer to 'let her have it.' She went flying like a rag doll, screaming in agony as she thudded to the hard wooden floor. And Friedkin, the consummate artist, dollied in to get that last close-up, before calling the paramedics. Now that's what movies are all about.This movie is what movies are all about.",8,3,5,27 January 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Only the penguin scored points with me.
","Alien vs Predator, by Paul Anderson 'Mortal Kombat', 'Event Horizon', 'Resident Evil', musical score by Harald Kloser 'Day after Tomorrow' brings two of the most popular adult science fiction monsters together for the first time, tying together not only our ancient civilizations but there's as well, in a action packed rite of Predator, and mankind.Satellites pick up a heat bloom 2000 feet below the ice in the Antarctic, and Weyland (Lance Henriksen) through topographical imaging discover it is a pyramid. Weyland Bishop, who is having health concerns, wishes this to be his legacy: to be the first one there. He gathers together a team of the finest in their fields: a scientist (Raoul Bova), a military man (Colin Salmon), mountain climber (Alexa Woods), and archaeologist (Joseph Rye) to pioneer the expedition to the pyramid. What they awaken inside though through their ignorance is a hunt that's been going on for thousands of years, between the predator and the aliens.The earth has been used by the predators since Egyptian times, where they taught the Pharoah's how to build the first pyramids, and allowed their people to be used as sacrifices for their rite of passage hunts, they were obligated every 100 years.We see Predator and a woman become allies, in a fight against the aliens. It adds a lot to the story, but also really changes a lot, and so a lot of fans will be angry. Kind of like a lot of fans who were upset while wanting to see another hardcore predator hunt in the deep swamp of part 1 with Arnold Shwarzenegger, got only a predator in LA with Danny Glover. No one could live up to the hype of waiting 7 years for Aliens back on the big screen. and a whopping fourteen years to see Predator reintroduced. That aside, the movie could have been better, should have been better.The resemblance of the Predator to the Rastafari has never really been questionable, with their dreadlocks, and powerful hunter stature. We also note that the only survivor through this ordeal, is a black woman, which makes this movie subjectively speaking, a black power film. Perhaps that was subconscious, or coincidence, it doesn't matter. I'm not bringing it up to make a race thing out of it, simply to denote similarities between African tribal cultures of Africa, with the Predator motif, and time line of the present film.Overall I did enjoy the film, though truly felt the last half hour was rushed, don't know why... a lot more could have taken place without getting too long. Many scenes felt blank, a lot of dead air, which led me to find the directing lacking to an extent. Still, a fun movie with nice overtones of loyalty, and honor, which is a trademark of Predator films. A sequel might be in order here. Harald Kloser did a much better job on the music for Day after Tomorrow, this movie seemed to lack memorability in the music, being simply 'action movie music' Predator stole the show. Well, thank heavens they gave that fluffeh penguin his full cameo scene... he had more frames in the movie then the queen alien. I hope fluffeh penguin has a good agent.",3,0,1,19 July 2007
Legends of the Fall," Sometimes forever is too long
","A remarkable cast for a remarkable tale, set in this stunning masterpiece of a film. I have always enjoyed the Hopkins/Pitt chemistry and this was no different. The entire cast was beautifully poignant, and thought I went into this movie not expecting to be impressed, I cried, moved by the profound depth of honesty this movie portrays.The eloquence of the narrations, Alberta so glorious, the music haunting and sweeping like an arc, or eagle's wing across the open sky.Legends of the Fall musical score is some of the most beautiful, and inspiring music to ever grace the silver screen. Every movie James Horner conducts rivals nearly anything I have ever heard next to the glorious sunrise of little birds, to the chirping of midnight crickets, he captures the essence of the heart as it flies. He elevates a film with majestic genius.Legends of the Fall is true to it's name. Confusing times beget confusing emotions beget loss, sorrow, destruction. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, and the wind blows the dust to the four corners, and no one remembers the memory is all that remains, behind the candle flame, in our eyes.The perfect cast, the perfect music, the perfect story. The problem with perfect is, it tempts God to take it away... and in this movie, it all gets taken away. And we are left with a poem. And that is why this movie won an Academy Award for best cinematography. The poetry was visual, but everything else elevated the poem to a muse, and a muse is forever, and forever turns out to be such a long time, sometimes forever is too long.Legends of the Fall is that parallel universe where everything falls into the wrong place. Squares fall trying to fit into circles, and we are cut by the sharp edges of the plot. Our hearts ache for the sandpaper of sense to save us, but we are only burned deeper by the memory of such folly. Cut deeper by it, until even hope lays scattered amongst the rock, like old bones. And one day when the sun rises at the end of your days, when you have lost everything but your soul, you might be fortunate enough to take a leap of faith for love, and in so redeem a lifetime forever more.",8,4,7,5 November 2004
Batman Begins," It's not what you are underneath that defines you, but what you do!
","Batman Begins is just so different, if you are expecting it to be like Burton's you will not only miss this film, but you will miss out.Batman Begins is a far more realistic idea, and has a far more rich back story that makes sense, from why Bruce trains, how he can do what he does, and even the suit and car make more sense.Sure it doesn't have the gimmicks kids fall in love with: Namely the car, the popping music, but it has so much more: Depth, Realism, and Meaning.These 3 things, along with brilliant acting, perfect pacing, script and directing create a movie one must watch a second time. And when you do you see the car for what it is, a relentlessness of spirit, the music for what it inspires...Afterall, 'it's not what you are underneath that defines you, but what you do! Batman Begins, a tour De force. A movie full of depth, introspection, and meaning. It even included little details like tiny strokes of a master's brush.Yes, Batman Begins, and continues in 2008, and I can't wait.You see there just aren't enough movies these days crafted with such passion, such loyalty to not only an idea, or a story, but to the future of film. Those who declare that yes, character development is important. Understanding, meaning, and integrity shines light on beauty, and brings hope like light to a darkened place, and this place where movies are made has grown so dark.That's why I rate this movie a 10.Seriously folks. I loved Burton's Batman as a kid. I was about 13 when it was in theaters, and as a kid I loved the Joker, the car, the music; it was just so much fun. But it isn't very logical. I mean take for example The Joker. He falls into a vat of toxic waste and his hair turns green but his face turns white? I mean come on, it was fun, as long as you didn't think too much about it. Great kids movie.Batman Begins is simply a more realistic film. It's got more depth, meaning, back story, logic, and simply makes more sense. It's a Batman for a more mature audience.Both fantastic movies, but I would never call Tim Burton's Batman brilliant, fun maybe, entertaining, memorable? Yes. While Nolan's Batman was an important film, because it had depth, and that's something missing far too often in today's movie industry.So you see, you can enjoy both movies, just for different reasons. And when you compare them, there's no need to bash either one, for both have their merits, and both should be commended for them.That is all.",8,2,2,19 July 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not for the Picky
","Overall an enjoyable movie, but it might have been far better if it had followed the comics more closely... I was a little disappointed, and here's why ... but first the review.Rogue, Anna Paquin is gorgeous, and this film had some nice pacing. Many of the characters are sidelined for most of the film, going so far as to alienate them even in death.Some great effects and character interaction, I had fun.What they did though is completely bastardize the X-MEN comics by throwing together elements from a What If comic, elements from X-men time lines that didn't even align, and left out major players and relationships.1 Handling of Dark Phoenix I was really looking forward to them creating Dark Phoenix as larger then life as in the comic, but they instead opted to portray her with a more zombie look than her fire aspect from the comics which were beautifully deadly.Check out the pictures here of Dark Phoenix, her costume and intensity... why didn't they have those elements in the film? Also in the comic 'What if Phoenix Had Not Died?', what brings Jean down is her own torment at having killed Scott, her true love from her innocent life... in the movie Scott dies and no one seems to give it a second thought? A huge disappointment for me was since this movie was largely based on a What if comic, in which Dark Phoenix kills Scott and Professor X, in the end she destroys the entire world after realizing she had killed her one true love. hell she might have even destroyed the universe.I didn't expect that, but I did expect her to come down from her Dark Phoenix trip by acknowledging she had killed Cyclops, remember him? Her true love? But no, no mention of his death at all! To me that's just lazy writing.What a loss, they really could have used that, it would have made more sense than Jean saying to Wolverine, 'save me'.Jean has the power of a phoenix. A phoenix always rises from its ashes.Phoenix is the most powerful mutant (I believe), and a tragedy. She is nearly archetypal in importance.2 Kitty/Colossus In the comics Kitty and Colossus were a pair until he killed for the first time and gets all scary and estranged from her, things don't get any better when (now correct me if I'm wrong) Kitty dies in the comics and he completely loses it after that.Kitty Pryde - Too short and stubby in the comics she was about 5'9' and slim and very bouncy like a kitten.3 Colossus He didn't even fight at the island that we saw, and we saw nothing of his awesome look from the comics.4 Wolverine I mean Wolverine's height has really fluctuated over the past few years in the 'core' X-titles, but all of us real fans know he is only 5'3'. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine Even though he's 6'2, there really is no question about it. Just as Christopher Reeve was the quintessential Superman. So I let the height thing slide.5 Juggernaut In a comic book where Wolverine is standing next to him, he is standing on top of a bar... and Juggs is STILL 4 feet taller than Wolverine, not to mention his arms are the size of wolverine's torso... though Jugg is like 9' tall in the comics so you'd have to CGI him to make him look right I suppose. Also his helmet looked like crap.6 Finale In the comics, when Professor X died, Magneto becomes a good guy and takes over as leader of the X-Men. I'd like to point out that Professor X did not die by the hand of Jean in the comics, that death is from a 'What If' issue called 'What if Phoenix Had Not Died' and exists completely outside the X-men universe) Turning Magneto into 'one of them' was just stupid writing.7 Sentinels The sentinels were hardcore and didn't come til later and nearly killed every mutant and became the toughest fights for the X-men, if I am remembering the comics correctly, it's been awhile, but they were only shown once in the film during a holographic training session.In closing we must remember the 'cure' Suppresses mutant gene X, doesn't get rid of, which means it could dissipate over time and lead into a fourth installment.Speculation? X4 will possibly align with the comics with Magneto replacing Professor X as leader of the X men against the Sentinels... maybe... and introduce the Kitty/Collosus love story, and Wolvie's fascination with Asian bombshells post Jean.",6,0,0,29 January 2008
The Mist," The Mist is more cautionary than we acredit
","The Mist is a movie based on the book by Stephen King, which was inspired by H.P. Lovecraft and The Lord of the Flies. Perhaps even Dawn of the Dead. but whatever influenced it, it must be said it has equally inspired others as well, among them one of the most popular PC Games 'Half Life'.The Mist brings into focus a military experiment gone awry. Where portals, doorways, windows to other worlds are opened, and what lies beyond is unleashed upon mankind. But it is much more than that. It is a story of faith, and man's worst enemy: ourselves. It talks of the survival instinct but in so that it can lose a fight against our own lack of faith.So a buddy of mine came over today and made me watch the DVD of this today, even though I watched the movie when it first came out.Definitely upon second viewing I enjoyed this movie so much more.The pharmacy scene is incredible. The tentacles ripping chunks of the Sherminator felt visceral. The acidy spider webs were freaky, and it just all worked better for me.You start out at home, go to the grocery store, to the pharmacy and back to the grocery, then to the finale. This movie really was well-rounded with a lot of story. The actress who played the religious woman was awesome, especially in the scenes where she was talking to God or to the creature who spared her life, that was sweet.When the military man at the end is explaining what the military was up to, he basically spells out the plot to the game Half-Life, awesome game by the way.Bernie Wrightson (who designed the Impossibly Tall Creature) said his design was inspired by an illustration from a Lovecraft book that depicted a mass of tentacles atop a bunch of elephant legs.I think the message was that mankind will bring about it's own destruction. We know curiosity killed the cat, but we rarely think about what it does to us.",8,4,8,1 July 2008
Mulholland Drive," A Puzzle Without Pieces
","After watching Mulholland Drive I felt I loved it, but I had no idea why.Perhaps because it made me feel better knowing this movie reflected the same confusion I often feel in my own life, grasping at straws for answers, are the straws even real? That gives some comfort.At times I thought I was putting together a puzzle made from the parts of 12 different puzzles. An over use of directing techniques betrays the film's seams, tearing at the plot until all that is left is a convoluted mess. 'We don't stop here...' I enjoy figuring out a movie for myself, but you have to have enough to go on to put the puzzle together. This montage more than movie, clings to madness like a sensory deprived post apocalyptic sycophant with a tit in their mouth, suckling wide-eyed on the dregs of a vast and empty mother.Naomi Watts was brilliant, and that is what stays with you after the movie is over. Her acting, depth of emotion... who was she? Who was Betty? Who was anyone? Were they even real? Was she? Who was Diane? Who Was Betty? A film of uncovering cosmic futility and the mortal coil, or something else?When the film begins we witness to a scene. A drive down Mulholland at night with a dark haired beautiful woman. She says.. 'we don't stop here.' The car is hit head on by partying teens driving too fast.She survives, and stumbles down into Hollywood bleeding, suffering from amnesia when she meets Naomi Wattses character, or does she?Naomi then reenacts this scene without the car accident, as though they are the same person reliving the same experience, but since the first doesn't know she's dead (amnesia), she becomes the other woman (Watts) to replay it for her?And what of Aunt Ruth? Who kills herself in the end? Were all the women Aunt Ruth playing out different time lines? Reflecting on each other until ultimately despondent, she commits suicide?I really have no idea what this movie is about lol.",8,4,7,25 May 2006
Saw," Every Peace Has A Puzzle
","Well, I was really expecting this movie to make me think, and it did not. I expected a very amazing ending, and to me the ending is linear, boring, and predictably disappointing. The acting was terrible, in fact some of the worst acting I've seen in a long time. It feels like the story had potential but lacked creativity, so lapses into predictability all the time. And yes it does feel like a rip off.It's disappointing to me, because I love Danny Glover, and I loved the possibilities, but it leaves us saying, 'okay... now what?' 'what was the point?' I thought it was a nice twist that Zep or Zap, whichever his name, was not the killer, but just another victim in the game. But, sadly, the story lacked any true depth, at least in my opinion.Some of the camera work was a lot of fun, nice effects there, and the caped man reminded me of the Allan Moore graphic novel hero from V for Vendetta interestingly enough... but, I wold have rather seen this microcosmic game effect a larger microcosmic level, and this movie sadly stays within the box.While I enjoyed Saw I and Saw 3 somewhat, I hated Saw 2, so was pleased when Saw 4 redeemed the series somewhat.",7,0,2,28 January 2008
Sinister," My Review
","Sinister is imho the best horror film of recent years, in large part to the incredible soundtrack 'Silence Teaches You How To Sing' by Ulver. Amazing work, I played it last Halloween on the porch, and it's super creepy stuff...Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, soundtrack by Ulver, written and directed by Scott Derrickson, definitely his best work.Sinister has a respectable horror film rating of 6.8 on IMDb, and a 63% on Rotten Tomatoes, so I think it's better than the average moviegoer, but they don't think it's that bad. I'm just more forgiving because of the elements I mentioned, plus I love the writing, the pacing, the music, I love mythology based weirdness.I think I've always been a sucker for found footage horror, even before it was its own genre, it was used sparingly, like in Prince of Darkness, The Ring, Hexen all the way back in the '20s is technically the very first found footage horror film ever made.Blair Witch brought it back as a genre, Grave Encounters is a personal favorite because it's also a parody of the show Ghost Adventures.",9,2,5,9 May 2014
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Harry Potter, maturing but not quite scripted
","For my self, I did feel the movie had some scripting problems. Dragon scene and some cohesive structuring near the end could have been better conceived, but overall it was a truly enjoyable movie.The Harry Potter story matures with every film, as it should, the only thing I did not really like was that each test Harry underwent, he did not seem to solve on his own through any ingenium of his own, except for near the end when he has the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade-style choose loyalty or greed, and he chooses wisely. I felt they could have structured those tests to make Harry appear a little more competent, though I suppose it fits his character. He is supposed to intellectually mundane, and not some standout genius or spectacular type except by birthright.For this I find the story very nice because it adds complexity to an otherwise straightforward story, and thus takes on a feel we all can relate to.I had a lot of fun with the movie, it had some nice dialog, plenty of different experiences to enjoy, and great effects for wallpaper making on the computer, which I love.",8,3,5,20 November 2005
1408," Dante's Inferno caught in a loop
","The Dolphin Hotel. The Kafka-esquire montage of despair. 56 deaths in so many years, and don't expect to check in unless you never plan on checking out. But sometimes a man must go where angels fear to tread to remember what it is he needs to believe.I watched this tonight; had to get drunk just to sit through it. I'm not saying it was bad, it was just tame, perfect for those with really thin skin, young teen horror I guess. I love the cast, so that's a plus. I love the premise, which is also good enough to keep me watching to the end, hoping it eventually satisfies. Whether it does or not I'll leave to each person's own experience.1408 had some great moments, probably from the short story; gotta give King props for that. One could say it's finally a good King adaptation since The Shining. Should have used room 237 again though just for fun.Scary? No, but all in all it was an enjoyable little throwback to the ghost stories I loved to read as a kid. Right down to the letter, or lack of any letters as it were.1408 is like Dante's Inferno caught in a loop, never making it to Paradise beyond.",10,0,0,30 June 2007
Sin City," Sin City Stays True Again and Again
","Sin city had a message, hell it had many.Sin City was a film carefully plotted from the genius of Frank Miller. I won't say the writing is as great as Allan Moore, but it stands it's ground. I really hoped Quentin Tarantino would throw in Chiaki Kuriyama (Kill Bill, Battle Royale) as Miho. Overall the movie had timing, some flaws, okay it had flaws, but it was probably the most true to the roots comic book based film ever made.V for Vendetta coming out, it's going to have a tough time outdoing Sin City, but if anyone can stand their own it's the works of Allan Moore.Here's a few far more disturbing films:Ichi the Killer Tetsuo Battle Royale Flowers of Flesh and Blood Cannibal FeroxYou get the point, there's thousands of more disturbing films.Sin City was a reminder of heroism and a warning to the threat our world is under by violence, drugs, war, prostitution, the strategic compromise of values. I got a very National Socialist propaganda ideology from the film... the swastika shurikan, and the idealistic nature of socialism in the hero role, the courage of man, and the superman in the future world of a brittle and decaying modern society that just doesn't work. I find the core elements of National Socialism intriguing, but can never figure out why evil men take up the doctrine, then twist it into the prejudice, murdering reality that is our history.Sin City was a reminder of where we've been, and a warning of where we're headed if we don't work out the hate before it's too late.Sin City in its original serialized comic form was everything that one would expect from the then well known artist/writer/creator Frank Miller and more. Many would come to say that it is his best work. For years it was a world that only existed on paper in black and white with splashes of color, but it was enough to make Sin City live and breath in ways that few others in the medium have ever been able to come close to. Because Miller's dark, noir overtones painted a very clear, and fully realized picture of every seedy back alley and strip club, and cheap motel room in the fictional Basin City it became painfully obvious that it was just too visceral a place to ever be real in a way that could be encapsulated on film, or at least we, including Miller himself, thought. We were wrong.This is THE comic movie we have been waiting for and it does not disappoint from the first overly dramatic voice-over to the last frame of the credit scroll. Telling three tales from Miller's world (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard) the comic transitions from paper to cellulose flawlessly and believably with a grace seldom seen. This ease is especially incredible for something so over the top and stylized like this that it's almost hard to imagine that these are the actors you've grown to know and love for years. But they are and it all comes together beautifully.The cast, crew, and artists involved in making this adaptation a reality should be commended for their service to the idea that a true comic book movie can, in fact, be made without making concessions to the masses, without altering the plot or changing the characters, and still manage to retain the feel that the ink on paper had while creating a truly entertaining film. Much of this film's success can be directly contributed to the fantastic casting job which encompasses an incredibly long list of a-list and up and coming celebs plus a few obscure but cult favorites (yes, I'm talking to you Rutger) and the tag team direction of Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez should be particularly touted for pushing Miller to finally do this project, and for leading the way to make this the film that Miller always wanted it to be and that Rodriguez knew he could make.While I do have a few nit-picky points of contention with cut dialog or certain actors/actresses that refused to bare it all for the sake of keeping intact every last detail from the books it doesn't change the fact that what was laid out on the polyester film stock before me was every bit as entertaining as the original works, and it made a pretty darn good flick to boot. If it's not already self-evident, the bar has been raised for the comic movie. The next brave soul willing to venture in had better be prepared to take on Sin City.",8,0,2,28 January 2008
Mad Max: Fury Road," Better than the original
","Mad Max: Fury Road My Score: 8/10I don't get to say that very often, but this story in every way was better than the original film... There is quite a lot of story. 1 - In Citadel you've got the haves and the have not's 2 - The military who are brainwashed and drugged up think they are working towards Valhalla, they are being used, this creates relevance and empathy for them 3 - The woman are owned as breeders, a lot of people in this society still want that 4 - A strong female lead who outshines the male lead in nearly every way but he does perform well, a good egalitarian balance overall 5 - Totally bad ass and great cinematography 6 - Guitarist was very cool 7 - Disillusionment, redemption, development of religion, comfort lies, and courage This movie had quite a lot of substance, more than I expected. It was emotionally satisfying, and follows through rather well. It's not perfect, but few movies are and ultimately it's far superior to the original films.",8,3,12,15 August 2015
Donnie Darko," I just saw Donnie Darko
","why is it movies where a main character travels back thru time to change things never has a happy ending? Is causality that daunting that we need to be reminded by  only negative reinforcement?It is about responsibility, and choices.People often think that; it is the big things in life that are all that matters, never realizing it is the little experiences that create the big ones.The little things we take for granted. People in general dont take responsibility for causality in their lives; and that is at the crux of every movie about time travel.The best critique of this movie that gave me chills and I quote:
'I can't recall a movie in which a song so perfectly conveyed the meaning of a scene. The song 'Mad World' plays over the end of the movie. It explains it all. It's Darko's theme song: 'And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad, The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had.'Indeed the ability to make a choice is always there, a choice out of fear and a choice out of love.   But even moreso, the path that is pathed with integrity, faith, and will, can make the loving action manifest in timeless ways.  And though no one will recognize, no one will know or see, it is nonetheless on the table.",8,0,0,29 January 2004
Alien: Covenant," Good followup to Prometheus
","I don't think ALIEN: Covenant is as bad as people are saying, but it does feel more like an extended pilot episode to a TV show than a feature film... all things being said, when you think of the production of TV these days it is hard to compete, especially since TV shows can spend years developing stories and characters, and movies really have to deal with pacing and story line constraints...All said and done, it was a good followup to Prometheus. My rating: 7/10",7,2,5,4 September 2017
The Martian," The movie had ironically about as much atmosphere as the planet Mars did.
","THE MARTIAN (My Film Review) Stuck on Mars possibly forever, no biggie I guess... I was a bit disappointed, I kept wanting it to be meaningful and powerful and extraordinary... but it just wasn't... it was too calm... I felt GRAVITY in my bones... how incredible it is that we exist, and thrive... I felt her journey like the journey of birth... it moved me... I liked the scene in this movie when he looks at the first little plant he grows... but felt little else... He's just too calm and cool throughout... so I could not relate with him on a human level at all. The movie seemed to really lack depth, it didn't challenge itself or the audience... except our patience and ability to listen to bad music and hokey dialog. The idea of being the only person on a planet is compelling... I wanted more though... some human emotion... I understand he's a trained professional, but he's also a human being... and the movie lacked depth, introspection, philosophy, humanity... I enjoy the testament to human ingenuity, and the movie had its moments I really loved... a nice touch at the end seeing the little plant, the little things perhaps he used to take for granted... yes that is a good lesson. The monologue at the end makes sense, but the map is not the territory and I feel he was perfect in its execution to the point of it being detrimental to the heart of the movie. The movie had ironically about as much atmosphere as the planet Mars did. My Rating: 6/10",6,8,21,12 October 2015
