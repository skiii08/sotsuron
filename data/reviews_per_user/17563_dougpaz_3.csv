United 93," A Truly Memorable Film that All Americans Need to See!
","Paul Greengrass has taken the all-too-familiar events of 9/11 and has created an emotionally charged human drama that will virtually wring you out with emotion and yet not stoop to sensational melodramatics.He made the decision to use unknown actors, many of whom were actual workers in their profession to tell a documentary-like, non judgmental story of how that fateful day went down. The amazing thing is how he is able to use these people to pull you into the story even though you know the eventual outcome. You truly feel as if you are on the plane yourself and watching through your own eyes and not the lens of a camera.For those that feel that this film is being done too soon after 9/11, I hope you see it before you make up your mind on that. It is more of a cinematic memorial to those valiant passengers that will be an everlasting remembrance. It is a film that every American should see.",9,7,15,29 April 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Truly Disgusting piece of trash
","Against my better judgement, I decided to watch this flick with hopes that it would be a comedy worth a few laughs. It ended up being a vulgar, ridiculous piece of trash. The language went way over the top with no real reason to do so. The comedy end was something that a bunch of high schoolers could have put together trying to get some shock value from their friends. I certainly expected some sexual humor and innuendos but this bordered on a poorly written porn film without as much flesh. I can't even imagine what they had to cut out so that they could save this sorry excuse for a move from getting an NC-17 rating.This abomination makes me really wonder about movie goers these days. I usually trust the IMDb ratings but cannot even imagine how anyone could give this junk a rating higher than a five let alone a seven. If only there were as many laughs in the film as there were vulgar outbursts, it would have truly been funny.Even with the fast forwards, it was a huge waste of my time!",2,2,7,18 July 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Wow, what a ride!
","I really had no idea what I was in for with this inappropriately named film. I had heard that the music was great but that was like saying that the Titanic ran into a little ice.  Clooney, Turturro and Nelson were comedic kings and the Cohens rivaled their 'Fargo' for regional humor.  The cinematography was beautiful, the story just funny enough, and I sang the songs in my head for days afterward.  It was a real injustice that this film was not nominated as best film among the Oscar set and just shows how little they really know. I was really impressed at a previously unseen side of George Clooney and will see this film again and again. (You have to just to catch all of the hidden chucklers!)",8,0,1,14 July 2001
