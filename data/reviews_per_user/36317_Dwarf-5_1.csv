The Blair Witch Project," Too Boring To Believe
","I've read, heard and seen a lot about how scary this movie is and having finally seen it on TV I have to ask myself 'What movie did everyone else see?'.  After an hour I had to turn it off, it was so bad.  Scary?  If being bored is scary then yeah, it might just be the scariest movie of all time. This ranks right up there with watching someone's vacation on Super-8.I wish I could rate this piece of crap in negative numbers.",1,3,6,29 October 2001
