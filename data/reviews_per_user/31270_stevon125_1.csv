Despicable Me 2," Nothing beats the first, but at least it didn't disappoint
","If you liked the first one, you'll enjoy the second one. But lets just lay on the table the things I didn't like about the movie. First my great pet peeve, was the lack of the 3 girls, the focus in dm2 is Gru and it shows. Yes the girls make an appearance, but you can tell by how their presented in the story that their basic side items. I would have like to see more interactions between Lucy and the 3 girls, instead of the instant fall in love with her. Agnes meeting Lucy was fine, and I know the other girls wanted Gru to date, but I would have been nice to see Margo and Edith make sure if Lucy was the right women. The movie kinda moved to fast, or I didn't seem to flow as well as the first one, its like they had all these idea to explore but had to edit so much more. I feel like this movie could have been 1 hour longer to further delve into the story. Other than those simple annoyance, which didn't effect my overall love of the movie, there are great scenes, the minions light up the show and Gru's father adaptation is great. I'm so happy that this movie did so well, making its money back and then some on just its opening weekend is impressive. Hopefully the signals the creation of despicable me 3, which I can't wait for. I actually can't wait to go see dm2 again. Actually I might go do that right now.....lol cya",8,0,0,20 July 2013
