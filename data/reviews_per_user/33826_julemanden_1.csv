Walk the Line," Superior Performances
","This is truly a superior movie. I don't understand how this could not even be nominated in the Best Movie category at the Oscars. Joaquin Phoenix delivers and absolutely stunning performance and is even singing all the songs in the movie himself! Not to speak of Reese Witherspoon who is playing the best she EVER did, no wonder she won that Oscar! Even the small parts in this movie has great cast, and is all played with such a devotion, especially Robert Patrick impressed me with his play as Ray Cash, Johnny Cash's father!This movie is gonna be remembered for years to come, that is for sure. Whenever you get the opportunity to see this movie, DO IT. When it gets out on DVD, BUY IT. This will be something to show to your kids, and let them see the true legends of times passed. A huge THUMBS UP from Denmark!",10,1,2,28 March 2006
