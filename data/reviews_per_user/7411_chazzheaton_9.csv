It," Creepy!
","I think this is one of the best horror movies that has been made in a long time. I must admit I haven't read the book so I can't compare but as a movie it works very well. The young actors are brilliant and the writers gave them a script so they actually sound like how kids hanging out with their friends would talk. Plot is well driven and runs very smoothly, doesn't feel like things are happening too fast or slow. There are plenty of creepy moments! Personally though, I feel as if it wasn't scary enough. I think that they overused Pennywise so he lost his scariness as he kept appearing every few moments. Great monster horror movies give you a little bit of the monster each time (think Alien or Jaws). I think they could have used the music a bit more to create suspense. Also I don't think they wrapped up the ending (which I won't spoil) enough, personally. Other than that the film was funny, well produced and had a great cast and I'm sure it will scare audiences!",7,3,9,11 September 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Stunning Movie
","Wow! What a film! I have to say that this is the most visually stunning animated movie I have ever seen, I have never seen anything quite like it. The pacing is just right, it is a near 2 hour movie but does not feel like it. The voice talent is fantastic, the animation is brilliant and the story is well constructed. Made the whole cinema laugh out loud!I really hope that Sony can continue to make movies like this, rather than the atrocity that was the Emoji Movie",10,3,5,7 January 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Really Boring
","I will start by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter series, but the charm and magic from the original books and movies doesn't appear in this film. I thought it was boring. I thought (from the title) that it would be Newt looking for fantastic beasts, you know, like the title suggests. Nope. There's another pointless plot line to the movie. I did like the characters for the most part. Jacob is a likable character and adds some comedy to the movie. It was nice to see some of the creatures mentioned in the books but the CGI was way off. This was a big budget film and the CGI looks like it's from 10+ years ago in some parts. I think the American 1920s setting doesn't really help as it makes this seem really far away from the Harry Potter series. I felt like it's running time was half an hour too long, which was a shame, I couldn't wait for it to be over as the plot was predictable. The characters actually in the main plot points I didn't really care about. Also I really struggle to understand Eddie Redmayne, he tends to mumble a lot! Over all I thought it was very dull, even the colour scheme was dull.",3,0,0,6 June 2017
Beauty and the Beast," A Bit Disappointing
","I enjoyed this film a lot more than I thought I would! However, there are a lot of problems. I did like how it gave us more detail into the curse. It also added more to the curse, how when each petal falls the castle starts to crumble and the staff become more and more less human. It really added to their desperation. I loved the piano and the wardrobe characters. It was also nice to see some diversity!! The costumes were fantastic, apart from the yellow dress. I was so disappointed. The girls at conventions can make an exact copy, why can't Disney with a budget of millions? It did not need a 2 hour run time, the parts about Belle's mother could have been cut out. It was nice to know but it added 0 to the story. The best character was Gaston played by Luke Evans. I thought he was fantastic! He really brought the character to life. The Beast wasn't right imo. I didn't really feel anything towards him, in the cartoon the audience can see straight away that he feels guilty about having kept Belle from saying goodbye to her father, he gives her the library etc.You really see his sweet side. However in the live action remake we don't see this, he doesn't give her the library as a gift he just short of shrugs and says something along the lines of 'you can't have it if you want whatever'. There isn't any reason for Belle to fall in love with him. The songs are great and creative, especially Be Our Guest, but the new added songs are dull and forgettable. The magic book was so pointless, it added nothing to the story, in fact it created a small problem. When Belle sees her father in the magic mirror, she runs off on the horse, but if the Beast had the book which could take them anywhere, why would she run all the way home? At least if she did that we wouldn't have to sit through the Beat's song. I was disappointed with the dance scene, there is a great part in the original where the 'camera' pans down from the chandelier and ends up on the floor as the dance past, for an animated film it is such an achievement and it's a wonderful scene; I was disappointed that they didn't include that famous shot. Again the dress was a let down. I think the cast was great and all the voice actors did a great job! Apart from Emma Watson, her face was dull, she had a really fake smile during Be Our Guest which was a shame because Belle is really into the routine in the cartoon. Also, when Beast transforms back into the Prince, she's just stood watching with a face like Kirsten Stewart, she's not really in awe or surprised that this is happening right in front of her eyes. The cartoon is so bright and vibrant, it's a wonder to watch. This however, the colour palette was great for the first 20 minutes, but it was really dull for the rest of the movie, which I know they wanted to make a 'darker' version but I don't think it really worked in this case. Conclusion: It was OK - but the original cartoon is much better.",5,5,11,27 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Stick To The First One!
","Man, I was really looking forward to this movie. I loved the first Guardians of the Galaxy. This however, was kinda boring. The producers looked at what worked in the first Guardians of the Galaxy and said 'hey we'll do that again' without actually thinking *why* it worked. An example is the soundtrack, usually the songs on the tape would be playing for the characters in the movie; when Peter is in the hospital, when he's on that abandoned planet, when he's dancing with Gamora etc. However in GOTG2 the 70/80s music just plays for the sake of it and selling more soundtracks. The 80s references felt misplaced and forced, the pac man reference at the end made me cringe. The CGI looked really bad, I mean, *really* bad. It felt like there were hardly any sets and the team just said 'we'll just CGI the whole thing'. If it looks bad now the film is not going to age well at all. I did think that it was a funny movie, though. The humour has carried on from the first movie and it did make me laugh out loud. The main characters are written really well even though there's quite a few of them to fit on screen in 2 hours. The plot could have been better, I felt like it was pointless really. I would have preferred if there was a movie of guardians just going around the universe being The Guardians of the Galaxy. this is just Peter and his dad issues.",6,2,5,11 September 2017
Arrival," Loved this movie until the end
","I thought this movie had such a good premise, and really good execution. The performances throughout the movie were brilliant, the design, cinematography, editing were all fantastic. But the ending ruined it for me, it turned the movie into something it didn't need to be. I won't spoil it as you can make up your own mind, but it left me wondering why it even happened. Overall though, the film is something that the sci-fi genre needed, an alien movie based on intelligence, not shooting them up. It is worth a watch.",6,0,6,9 August 2018
Wonder Woman," Brilliant
","I love this movie. I have been a fan of Wonder Woman for some time and this film really does her justice. She has been around for 75 years and finally in 2017 she gets her own film! The pacing is great, the music is great, the actors are great, the colour schemes are great. I came out of the cinema so happy at how this film had portrayed Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot is a a perfect casting choice and Chris Pine is great as Steve Trevor. The WWI setting I found really interesting and unique for a superhero movie, it worked really well. Patty Jenkins did an excellent job!!! I thought some of the CGI could use a touch up and there could be less slow motion, but apart from that it's a wonderful film.",9,17,35,16 August 2017
The Greatest Showman," A Fun Movie
","The Greatest Showman is a fun movie to watch. It's a feel good movie that it suitable for the family to watch. The soundtrack is great, the cast is talented and it's pleasing to the eyes. However, it does bother me that unlike a lot of musicals set in the past, the music does not fit the era. The choreography and the music is not something you would see in the late 1800s. The film itself is strictly ok, a bit too fast paced in places so we don't get to see much character development, the plot is standard and entirely predictable. A bit lacklustre. It's not Oscar worthy but it is a really enjoyable film, a total guilty pleasure. This is a great film to watch after a bad day!",7,1,4,7 June 2018
Annihilation," Unsettling
","This movie is probably one of the best from 2018. It won't be to everyone's taste but it is well worth a watch. The concept is original and the design and execution is fantastic. The soundtrack, acting and editing all add to the atmosphere. It is really quite unsettling at times, the fear of this great unknown. To some viewers the movie would feel slow and dull, but imo the pacing was just right. There were also a couple of genuinely quite scary moments! It's a great independent movie to watch",9,0,2,16 August 2018
