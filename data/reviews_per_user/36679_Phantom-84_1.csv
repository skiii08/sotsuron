Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Get a grip
","To all of you who complain how Lucas lost his magic when he did 'Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace,' let me just say this one thing: get a grip. Okay, so Jar-Jar Binks is the most annoying character in moviedom.  That's the only bad thing about it.  I believe that with what Lucas had to work with, he did wonders with it.",Null,0,0,26 March 2000
