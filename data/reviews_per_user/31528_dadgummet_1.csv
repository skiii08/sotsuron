The New World," Bad dialog, music, acting (at times). Good costumes.
","Horrible music. The annoying opening 'discovery' music which is played anytime there is a new 'discovery' really grates on one's nerves. It's one harmony crescendoed, that's it, and the so called composer for this movie didn't even write it! And then there is the theme from one of Mozart's piano concertos, a 40 second clip only, which was heard 5-6 times throughout the movie in the most predictable places. Most people who watch this movie and complement the composer do not realize did not write most of the music used in this movie.The dialog, as is in almost all so called blockbusters these days is clichéd. The director used too many shots of the young actress giving us her wonderful smile, used to show her innocence and purity and gaiety. This got old very quickly. We get the point, move on.The people who say it was beautifully shot do not get out enough into nature or watch any nature documentaries on TV. There is really nothing new here that the director gives that you can't get elsewhere in real life or not. If you want to see breathtaking beautifully shot movies then you need to check out Werner Herzog's stuff w/Kinski or Akira Kurosawa to see how it's really done.There is rampant clichéd symbolism such as the bird flying into the sky at the end. I was unaware of the story of Pocahontas, but nevertheless, this story was quite predictable and the emotions of the main characters obvious at all times and predictable. I could go on and on like this movie did, but alas. See it if you want to pat yourself on the back when you're done and curse the philistines who 'don't get it' or feed whatever superiority complex you may have.Costumes were pretty good, however, it was obvious the studio was going for a PG-13 rating to maximize their profits (although we got a nice glance at Pocahontas' right butt cheek at one point). The battle scenes were a letdown as well due to the studio's desired rating. This could have been a much better film if the director was allowed more realism.",1,3,11,22 January 2006
