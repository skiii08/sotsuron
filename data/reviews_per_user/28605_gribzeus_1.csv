Hereditary," Laugh-Inducing Failure of a Movie
","I don't typically write on things like this, but this movie was so disappointingly ridiculous I actually made an account on IMDb just to share how utterly terrible this movie was. I can't sit through a basic, low rated horror film without closing my eyes. So, when I was peer pressured into going, I thought it would be my worst nightmare. Instead of having my normal reaction, I was actually laughing at the ludicrous scenarios that were playing. I wasted my money on a film that, as far as I'm concerned, I couldn't even describe what had happened after I'd finish the movie. It seemed like it moved so slow that the audience got bored before it was half way done. Enough with the 'artsy' movies. Let horror be horror. This was a movie that was hyped to be the best horror movie in years, but turned out to be a disastrous cluster of unfortunate events, leading to a garbage-fire ending.Please don't waste your money on this movie!",1,2,9,9 July 2018
