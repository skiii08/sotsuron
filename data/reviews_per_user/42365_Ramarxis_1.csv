Mission: Impossible III," Not worth watching. Wait until it shows on T.V.
","Mission Impossible III is not worth watching. It uses very cheap cinematographic tricks. The filming was dark and the camera was vibrating constantly, making it difficult for the viewer to focus on any single moment (much like a music video). I ended up with fatigued vision and a headache.The camera blows up (zoom in) the faces constantly, specially Tom Cruise's. Nobody knows exactly where the characters are on any particular moment. The 'action' was cheap and out of focus (literally). The plot was old, tired and simplistic (nothing new), almost ridicule. I believe the producers of this low cost movie are taking advantage of the public who liked parts I and II (which are great movies). Someone is trying to capitalize on this!My advise: wait until they show it on T.V.",1,12,31,9 May 2006
