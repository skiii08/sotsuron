Casablanca," Well worthy of being a classic film
","Casablanca is easily one of the most famous movies of all time, so I had high expectations while watching it. As I expected, it did not disappoint in the slightest. The characters were great, the sets and accompanying visual elements were stellar, and it even gave me feelings of stress and fear concerning the Nazis. The storyline sucks you right in and stays that way until the famous end scene. The portrayal of the stress and fear that was overtaking Europe at this time was spot on and the personification of American neutrality in the main character, Rick Blaine, while everyone else needs his help is absolutely perfect. Overall, this movie is great and seems like the type of movie that gets better with each time you watch it.",10,2,3,13 March 2013
Citizen Kane," Certainly a classic, but over-hyped for my tastes
","The elegance and production quality of this film are absolutely stunning and flawless for the time. The plot and storyline, however, left much to be desired to me, as they were slow developing and not as exciting as I had hoped. The extensive length of the movie also hindered how I felt about the overall quality of the film. My negative criticisms of the film aside, I do still believe that this film is deserving of the high praise and prestige that it receives and is known for. Overall this movie was an excellent masterpiece that was well designed, put together, and thought out, unfortunately, it was just not to my tastes and I could not enjoy it like most people did.",7,2,3,10 May 2013
The Grapes of Wrath," A very long classic
","This movie portrays the average life of an American citizen that was dealing with the Dust Bowl. In a constant search for good work, the Joad family is forced to travel away from their home in Oklahoma to the 'promised land' of California, where the family hoped that they would be able to find work and make a better life for themselves. I was very pleased with most of the aspects of this movie, except for one major thing; the movie is over two hours long. It's very difficult to keep someone entertained for this long, but this film does a good job at it, thanks to a very interesting storyline and a desire to see whether or not the Joad family does eventually find the 'promised land' that they were searching for.",8,0,1,13 March 2013
