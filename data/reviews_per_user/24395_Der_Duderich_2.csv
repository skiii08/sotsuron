The Incredible Hulk," well....okay....but why?
","Growing up with the comic books of Spiderman & Co. I am a huge fan of the - only now possible - movie adaptations of those stories. This being said I admit not reading many Hulk comics in my early days but still I know enough of the character.Also I am a great fan of Edward Norton which in my opinion is one of THE top actors out there. However, even if I am the only one, I was very happy with the first Hulk movie - because of the depth of character shown in it (also thanks to an incredible and totally underrated Eric Bana).All in all I find the new movie entertaining and I love the special effects... but where did the personality go? To be honest, with any different, less known and less credible actors I probably would have left the cinema during this movie - sorry to say.Hope you enjoy it anyway.",5,2,5,13 July 2008
X-Men: First Class," fan-tastic
","I usually do not write reviews but on this one I just HAD to! I am a great fan of the X-Men, starting to collect the comics when I was a kid. My favorite was always Wolverine and - although the first 3 X-Men movies were okay - he was never as good as in the comics. Hugh Jackmann was just not the right guy for me... Having said that, I was not sure what this movie would be like (no Wolverine - except a short cameo). I must admit, I was more than pleasantly surprised and am tempted to state this is the best X-Men movie of all of them. I did like the first movie but they just got more and more shallow and more about Wolverine than the X-Men. However, the cast was supreme (apart from Hugh Jackman). LOVED THIS MOVIE and will Certainly recommend it to fans of the 'real story' - although this was never part of it. Job well done",8,1,2,11 June 2011
