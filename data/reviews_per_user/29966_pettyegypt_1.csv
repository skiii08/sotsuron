Child 44," Very well done
","A fine film if overly long. You could have shaved a half hour off it.The premise was engaging and thoughtful. At times thought felt it lost itself a little and I didn't quite understand why, when Leo and Raisa were freed instead of executed, the authorities then spent the whole second half of the film chasing them down again. I feel it wasn't quite driven home just how much the 'no murder in paradise' needed to be believed.That said, this is probably my shortcoming and not the movies.Very good performances all round. The more I see Tom Hardy the more I think he'll be a fantastic older actor...he just needs other people not to see him as a Twinkie.",7,1,2,18 May 2019
