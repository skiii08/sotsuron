First Man," A Great Story Put Me Asleep
","The movie had so much potential. An incredible story. A great book. A complete snooze of a movie. Full off historical mistakes and dull, plodding pace.I suppose all movies about the American Space Program will be judged against Ron Howard's great Apollo 13. That movie conveyed the energy even the simplest action had in the race for the moon. This character study of Neil Armstrong left me cold.I heard that Armstrong's boys said it was an accurate portrayal of the man. That may be, but could he be really have been as lifeless as Ryan Gosling's interpretation? I have to blame the director.Maybe they had to pay Gosling so much that there was no budget left for upscale sets and CGI. The whole movie felt somewhat low budget.If I was in a movie theater, I might have walked out.",3,2,3,23 February 2019
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A classic by a genius
","This classic by Stanley Kubrick is not only a cracking good story but reflects the times in which it was released. A stellar cast combined with silky black and white production, this film has so much going for it, it is hard to know where to begin. This is satire at its best. Each fully developed character is played with gusto, especially Peter Sellers who has no fewer than three roles. George C. Scott as General Buck Turgeson is also granted some terrific lines that he delivers with a almost child like awareness, completely oblivious of the import of what he is saying. The film switches between artfully crafted, beautiful composed cinematography and a rugged hand held documentary style. There are scenes in a b-52 bomber that are so realistic that you feel you are right in the airplane. Anyone who wants to see a group of actors and a brilliant director, all at the top of their game, will enjoy this movie.",10,4,6,2 February 2016
