Moneyball," Interesting information for fans - not a movie
","Here's a bunch of baseball fans or people connected to it who think this movie is also 'good' for non-fans. Reminds me of religious tracts for members of a religion whose authors will claim they are also very suited for non-believers.This is not a bad movie. The internal management ambiance of the sport is, I am told, well reflected. Good acting by Brad Pitt and the other guy playing the nerd. But there is no cinematography. The storyline can be fully described in half a sentence. There is hardly any character building except tiniest elements shown (ex-wife, daughter, etc.). If you are NOT interested in baseball this movie is not for you and if you are, OK, here is some information, it is good but still not a movie.Sorry to dissent from almost everybody else.",Null,0,0,8 January 2012
