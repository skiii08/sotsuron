First Man," Riveting and a resilient character study that ultimately delivers
","The man walks on the Moon. The man walking on the Moon. Man does a Moon-walk. Take a moment and think about those phrases. Soon the weight they carry will start to set in. The man, after thousands of years, thriving and evolving on the land we call Earth, has taken a leap forward and reached out successfully to another celestial object, the prominent presence for countless nights gone by and to further come, the Moon. First Man tells the tale that has great significance on us, humans, and our unquenchable thirst to travel beyond our home, but more than anything, it is a character study on one common man, the pre-mission life story of Neil shedding light on how the greatest space venture of all time in human history was not quite the smooth sailing, and the demons lurking in the backyard had to be faced before the baby steps on Moon was to be realized. Played by Ryan Gosling, the biopic is a slow burner that if follows the routine event-by-event procedure, does so with sections of precursors skillfully mixed in that keeps the narrative of the movie going along. It is almost done to near perfection that once the curtains are about to be drawn out, there is an immense feeling of satisfaction and a tinge of awe raining down. This is something that Director Damien Chazelle has masterfully knit together and highly merges with the stoic performance by Ryan Gosling which is splendidly supported by his wife played by Claire Foy, never shy of highlighting the prevailing gospels. There is a major emphasis put on the programs preceding the mission, all which bring forth setbacks and further challenges, and a bulk of the movie ponders over whether the dream can actually be realized and showcases the personal challenges for Neil and his family. The social commentary, public perspectives and the usage of old clips are kept minimal and in little abundance but enough to infuse the sense of a real life drama but props to the level-heading acting of the cast that brilliantly pulls through.The two space-faring contemporaries at the time at the height of their competition with subsequent ventures that would change the whole world. But this look at American programs from the Gemini to the Apollo missions are realized from the perspective of the astronomers and not how the world viewed it as. The stern defiance to the eye-popping visuals and the grandiose appeal a space drama expects to have, Damien Chazelle instead gives us a riveting realism of human wishful requirement demanding to break-through, not completely reliant on a sense of patriotism.That is not to say that the film isn't patriotic enough, the height of competition between the Astronauts and the Cosmonauts definitely is a quench of thirst and the fuel to the engine, but more than that, First Man is about hard work. Getting to the Moon was hard, Director Chazelle makes this gripping piece hard to digest alike. But the fruit, when reaped, is a gift, and when the curtains are about to be drawn on the climax, First Man blows it up. A set of masterful music communicating the monumental first steps, the sporadic visual of the alien surrounding and finally the glimpse of us from afar. The excellent cinematography and the visions of Director Chazelle crafts a beautiful climax. Infused with moments of silence with imagery that convey the message better than anything. A momentary dive into something new and when it snaps, we're back to the reality. I felt like this was such a masterful execution that is at the height of the movie and is the fruit to the audience that is awaiting it. Damien Chazelle makes sure not to delve too deep and when the dream is realized, there is a great feeling of triumph. 'One small step for a man, one giant leap for Mankind.' First Man delivers to that noteworthy remark and is a look back on one of the important and earmarked missions for humanity to voyage deep into space.",8,1,5,14 October 2018
Taxi Driver," A good watch.
","'Listen, you fuckers, you screw-heads. Here is a man who would not take it anymore. A man who stood up against the scums, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit. Here is someone who stood up.'Taxi Driver is a difficult movie to digest, part of what makes it so infectiously uncomfortable is how it tackles themes of existentialism through a mentally deranged yet charming Robert De Niro. It has this uneasy morbidness and hypnagogic tone covered throughout and although I think the movie has definitely aged, it still is as compelling to watch and relate to in this day and age. A major part of it comes through Robert De Niro's anti-villainist depiction of Travis and him trying to put his lost consciousness back in place after being a social outcast. 7/10, would recommend. A dark hit from the legend Scorsese himself.",7,0,2,4 March 2018
Dunkirk," Review from a Nolan fan. Dunkirk is an experimental waste.
","Dunkirk is a rather strange film. You may ask, is it a war film? Or is it a rescue tale based on a true story? Whatever the answer may be, Dunkirk fails to assert a response. The story falls flat and is covered by incomplete counter perspectives. There is no character development, the film lacks an overall essence of a war-torn environment. Now this may be a deliberate move, as the film progresses it sets a criterion to not represent an emotional war drama but to realize a genuine feel of a scenario of soldiers trapped, rescue undertakings and aerial assaults. Albeit the result is a hot mess with a non-linear but deranged narrative progression that takes the film nowhere.There isn't a titular character in Dunkirk. The film revolves around a conceivably three different viewpoints; The Mole, The Seas and The Air as depicted as. The Mole, stocked with allied soldiers from England, France and Belgium. Or as the movie explains it to us as. There is less to no introduction to any of the characters. We get stuck with a certain teen who is an English soldier trying to flee the German invasions. That's literally it, there is no one else other than Fionn Whitehead that the movie even tries to explore into, and the one we get to watch isn't as impressive either. He has very little dialogue, a fairly major involvement into the situation yet cast aside when required to. Oh and did I mention the French and the Belgians were included too? Too bad because the French involvement is minute and the Belgian almost non-existent. The next we move into the seas, where a band of three men, one too old for war and two youngsters head on a voyage to the place the target of the German forces, Dunkirk. 'You're weekend sailors not the bloody navy.' is as accurate a quote that the movie has managed to come to its assigned category. If I were to sympathize with a character it has to be Cillian Murphy who was harshly bereaved of his talents as a leading soldier to some jet fighter pilot who was cheaply stripped of his duties to mix in with the so indeed weekend sailors. And if he was to be the second-in to another main actor assigned to the aerial duties, which also brings us to The Air, Tom Hardy; then its another major setback as the bloody main guy assigned to save the grace of the soldiers, has less than ten minutes in his entire screen time.Hans Zimmer is the legendary figure once again working with Christopher Nolan behind Dunkirk, assigned to create the music, and he does again so masterfully. Zimmer's cold and monotonous 'ticking' soundtrack is constant for the entire 1 hour 46 minutes the movie runs for. His score is nothing less than perfection, with suitable chords that sync with the scenes of unrest and horror portrayed throughout the film. With all that's told, the one fact I want to be bring up is that the background music is remembered or brought up because of two factors; Either the story line and plot adjust so well the score that it creates an unforgettable piece of art (something that the duo of Nolan and Zimmer have done so often in the past.) and gives us something to remember for a lifetime. On the other hand its the only piece of saving grace in the entire film. Dunkirk resorts to the latter, but I will also add that it conjures up very little that it results to the outstanding piece of music is the only thing that is noted for in the entire movie.Picture this. A war drama based on historical events of monumental status with the brains of a certain Christopher Nolan behind it. A sane man would have all rights to believe Dunkirk to be a tour de force of nature, but instead we get an experimental wastage that lingers around only with the use of an incessant soundtrack and some beautifully captured cinematography. Dunkirk is alas a non-visceral realization but an exempt from a supposed War Drama.",5,7,19,23 July 2017
Everest," A visual treat for adventure fans but that's all there is to it.
","Just came back after watching Everest in 3d and don't quite know what to say about it. This was one of the eagerly awaited film of the month and it turns out be just another exploitative survival-type film. Apart from the excellent visual effects, there wasn't anything much to quote about the film. Sub-par acting and a lack of a main star/actor make Everest a pretty average movie. The fact that it's 2 hours long make it a kind of a stretch which is exactly what the movie tends to do after the interval.Some positives about Everest is though that the achievement in visual effects makes it an excellent adventure given the 3d experience. The locations the movie is shot as well make it a satisfying watch. It also plays a part in the scenes of catastrophe, in which it completely delivers the horror of what the actors are going through.Overall a pretty good watch but won't encourage you on spending your money on this one. Final rating: 7.1/10",Null,0,5,17 September 2015
Annihilation," Could've been much better
","The real objective behind Annihilation remains shrouded in mystery and it can simply be misrecognized as an action packed adventure and contact with possibly an otherworldly being. However upon viewing, it is made clear that it is a character study of one's nature of self-destruction. It is evident that the movie draws inspiration from the monumental classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey, for its bold, idiosyncratic nature of storytelling and range of ambiguity from its segmental story-telling narrative. My main problems with the movie was how the main cast of the movie is assembled together. More emphasis is put on emotion and less on the scientific forefront. The characters are basically forced into a suicide mission and that is why the core narrative of the film feels forced. There is foreshadowing and 'symbolism' that don't matter much to the context of the movie because the entire movie is seen upon from the perspective of Lena, a survivor of the expedition. In my opinion, it just makes the film unnecessarily broad and pseudo-ambiguous than it needs to be, and that can be associated with the ending. It comes to a halt where the consciousness of the mind has been jaded and where one's morality and the laws of physics itself are rendered as distorted. A cat and mouse game ensues where the initial interpretation is to perceive the blurring line between what's real and fake. Now this would've been much different if the movie took a more complete approach to the situation and not just focus one character's circumstances and the resolve to undertake the mission. Now I'm not saying all of it is bad, for the prism-like otherworldly entity that's being made contact with presents us with a fresh paradigm and it's definitely a film that is open to discussion. However my take-away from this is that the mastermind behind Ex Machina just couldn't hit the mark with this one.",5,4,7,15 March 2018
