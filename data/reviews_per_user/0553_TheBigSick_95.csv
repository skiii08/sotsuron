Ford v Ferrari," Possibly the best car racing film of all time
",The racing sequences are simply thrilling and intense. The cinematography and editing are just crazy. The script is well written. There are plenty of twists and turns. The ending is beyond everyone's expectation.Bale and Damon are marvelous. Bale's British accent makes him totally unrecognizable. Mangold proves again that he is brilliant in directing an action thriller.,Null,5,13,16 November 2019
The Avengers," The villains are too weak
","The only threat of the villains is Loki, who could be handled easily by Banner or Thor single-handedly. Barton and Banner were mind-controlled by Loki, but that was just temporary. Loki just started a war that he would never win. The storytelling is highly unbalanced. The visual effects and action sequences of the last fourty minutes were sensational and thrilling, yet the long part before it was boring and useless. Some action scenes lack credibility and look fake, as nobody gets injured or bleeds, and the editing of the film is not convincing. The name 'Avengers' is misleading, since these superheroes are not avenging and are just saving the world. Particularly, the war criminal Loki was not sentenced to death. 'Savers' might be a better name for the team.Overall, this film does not live up to its hype.",Null,1,2,6 June 2018
Blade Runner 2049," Reasons why the film commercially fails
","It is clear that 'Blade Runner 2049' underperforms at box office, especially in the United States. There are several reasons for that. First, the film depicts humans as evil and replicants as justice. 'War for the Planet of Apes' did the same, paying tributes to apes while slashing humans. All the audiences are humans and obviously they don't want such a setting. Secondly, the pace is too slow. You can sleep for twenty minutes, and when you wake up, you can still catch up with the plot. Third, bad editing. It seems that Denis Villeneuve is a narcissist and just puts everything he shoots into the film.",Null,13,28,13 October 2017
First Man," Another triumph for Damien Chazelle
","This film 'First Man' honors an iconic figure in American history, Neil Armstrong. The execution of the film is one of the best I've ever seen. The standard three-act narrative structure is mixed with a sometime parallel narrative. There is a prefect balance and connection between the depictions of the work and family life of Armstrong. Claire Foy gives a memorable emotional performance and could be nominated for a best supporting actress award.From a technical point of view, the sound editing is stunning, and makes you feel real. The visual effects and production design are also noteworthy. The editing is as good as in every film by Chazelle. Actually, this could be the best biopic in technical terms.",Null,0,3,24 November 2018
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Just an unconvincing horror film
","I thought it would be a fascinating action thriller, yet it turns out to be a nasty horror film that turns to supernatural power. There is simply no logic or reason behind the screenplay. The overall music score and the action sequences in the third act are good, which prevents me from giving this film a one star.",Null,1,9,30 June 2018
Minority Report," As boring as 'Blade Runner'
","If you suffer from insomnia and really need some sleep, then congratulations! You don't have to take sleeping pills anymore. Instead, you can watch the first half of this film, 'Minority Report', which is extremely slow and sufficiently boring to make you sleep. All the digressions and flashbacks only shatter the main plot, and render the film rather unfocused. You only know what 'minority report' means after the one hour mark.",Null,2,10,26 February 2018
Detroit," Bigelow is good at making a thriller, but not a drama
","Kathryn Bigelow is known for her documentary-style camera-work and the creation of an intense atmosphere. This can be seen, either from the early work like Near Dark and Point Break, or from her more recent films such as The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty. In one word, she is a good director for thrillers.But Detroit is not a pure thriller. It is more like a period drama. On the one hand, the interrogation in the motel is the thriller part of the film, and without any doubt, it is brilliant. The audience keep wondering what would happen next. On the other hand, the film as a whole is mediocre in story-telling and character development. The setup for the interrogation is unnecessarily too long. Also, the courtroom process after the interrogation is too short. For more than once, Bigelow just simply displays lots of texts on the screen to make up for her unbalanced story-telling. John Boyega's character could have been the most impressive because he is the most struggling one in conscience. Yet it turns out to be untrue due to the limited time and space given to the character. Overall speaking, Detroit could have been a thought-provoking classic, but it lacks depth in the end. There is no deeper discussion on the cause of the injustice or the impact it is could bring to real life. One real classic period drama is Spielberg's Schindler's List. In this aspect, Bigelow is still one step away from being a great director. One more thing, Will Poulter deserves a nomination for Oscar best supporting actor, whose performance is the key to the success of the thriller part.",Null,14,32,6 August 2017
A Star Is Born," A total disaster
","The editing is a mess, and the transitions of the plot or characters are rather strange. There is no narrative focus and the storytelling is unbalanced. I cannot really understand why such a bad movie received an overwhelming approval from the critics. Maybe they are all fans of Gaga? Bradley Cooper should stop making movies.",Null,42,74,10 October 2018
Wind River," A simple thriller, yet a powerful melodrama
","Sicario and Hell or High Water shows that Taylor Sheridan is a talented writer, and here in Wind River, Sheridan proves that he is also a brilliant director. The story is really simple here. Perhaps the most thrilling part is the gunfight outside Matt's trailer, which is not only violent, but also astonishing. The scene of Cory and the raper on the mountain is also exciting. Sheridan succeeds in giving the audience the authentic experience. The movie emphasizes more on the emotional transition after losing the loved ones. In Wind River, Jeremy Renner gives his career-best performance. The editing is amazing when Jane knocks on the door and the rape story is seamlessly told in flashback. Together with fantastic music, sound, camera-work and makeup, Sheridan simply makes a powerful melodrama that surely moves every viewer.",Null,4,8,7 August 2017
The Death of Stalin," A bitingly cold political satire
","The film 'The Death of Stalin' uses a comedic and satirical approach to depict the power transition from Stalin to Khrushchev following Stalin's death. The direction, screenplay, production design, costume design and the ensemble performances are brilliant. The appropriate employment of inter-titles, which cite articles from Soviet laws, beautifully connect various parts of the film. Under the political humor is the bitingly cold history, especially the absurd trial and execution of Beria.",Null,0,5,20 February 2018
Mulan," One of Disney's best movies of all time
","Great music score and songs, twisted plot, fun dialogues, brilliant voice cast, and most importantly, fantastic animation techniques, together form 'Mulan', one of Disney's best movies of all time.It is really an incredible super-heroine movie whose story originated in Asia. I love every aspect of it, especially the theme song 'I'll Make a Man Out of You'.",Null,0,1,28 August 2017
The Big Lebowski," A worse movie by Coen brothers
","The cinematography is solid, and the dialogues are well-written. Bridges gives an unforgettable performance. However, the story lacks credibility and there are too many illusional or disturbing scenes that have nothing to do with the plot. The style is strange, and this is below average among the movies by Coen brothers.",Null,2,5,13 February 2019
Captain Marvel," Quite solid filmmaking
","The two-hour long Captain Marvel has a standard four-act structure, where each act has thirty minutes. The first and second act present some old-school hard-hitting action sequences, and the sound editing is impressive. The third act and fourth act offer some stunning set pieces, particularly the plane crash scene and the missile intercepting scene. There is also a major plot twist in the third act. Jackson, Larson and Lynch all give notable performances. The illusory scene in the fourth act is a failure.",Null,1,8,8 March 2019
Spider-Man 2," WOW!!!
","This is a film that once you start watching it, you cannot stop. It is a surprisingly stunning film, both for its emotionally resonant melodrama and for its visually dazzling special effects. The protagonist struggles between being Spider-Man and being Peter Parker. Being a Spider-Man requires fighting against the villains and saving the civilians. Being Peter Parker demands a quiet life with Mary Jane. There are just tons of proverbs or mottos in the film: the screenplay, particularly the dialogue design, is simply amazing. The design of the villain is also fantastic, and is kind of unique in the history of superhero movies.",Null,1,4,11 June 2018
The Irishman," Mind blowing screenplay
","The storytelling is in multi-layer. The main event is told in flashback, and the side events are told in flashback of flashback. The dialogues are smartly written. Particularly, the dialogue about fish is an interesting metaphor. The only bad thing about the film is that it is too long. That's a problem with Netflix film. They don't care about box office, and the director can just put everything he shoots into the film.",Null,2,11,16 November 2019
Aquaman," Rather mediocre
","Neither the narratives nor the visuals are convincing. The plot is simply a mess and lacks any sense of credibility. The storytelling is awful, with no buildup or climax. The visuals are completely fake and do not look real at all. James Wan should go back to direct cheap horrors.",Null,2,9,25 December 2018
Juno," Smart script and wonderful performances
","Well, for a typical coming-of-age film, the quality of script and acting performances almost decide everything. And for this particular one, both the script and performances are noticeable, just as those from other brilliant coming-of-age films, such as The Edge of Seventeen, The Spectacular Now, Lady Bird, and so on. The casting is the base for the performances, which is also pretty well done. The most distinct feature of this film lies in the slight twist in plot and the novel topic, pregnancy for high school teenagers.",Null,1,3,3 July 2018
Deadpool 2," A wildly entertaining sequel
","Josh Brolin is awesome. For the last month, he has been dominating world cinema with his formidable supervillain Thanos. All the moviegoers have been talking about him and his character. Here in this film Deadpool 2, he continues his dominance with a new supervillain Cable, and this time the new character has a heart. In some way, Josh Brolin is transforming the character development of villain that is usually bad for no reason, in the sense that his charaters are either reasonable or not that bad, or both. This sequel improves over its 2016 original movie 'Deadpool' in terms of the number of jokes and the number of topics covered in the jokes. Particularly, it refers to Martin Luther King Jr.'s speech. It also touches on James Cameron's actioners 'Terminator' and 'Terminator 2' that some villain is traveling back in time to kill some boy, preventing something in the future to happen. Even Brolin's makeup is similar to that of Schwarzenegger. Of course, nothing is perfect. The shortcoming of this movie is the same as its original, which is that the plot is too simple. Besides, the profanity and violence prevent it from being a family-friendly movie.",Null,2,7,21 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Better than the first two installments, but still garbage
","The Thor franchise should be the worst in Marvel Cinematic Universe. The first two installments are complete garbage. This third episode is improved, but in a very limited way. More concretely, the screenplay is added with more adventure and humor, but the plot as a whole is too scattered and unfocused. Particularly, the gladiator part is unnecessarily too long. The talent of Cate Blanchett is largely wasted in such a movie. I hope that she could play some more challenging roles.",Null,1,8,3 February 2018
The Terminator," One of the best Sci-Fi thrillers of all time
","The plot is extremely twisted in the third act. When the audience think that the Terminator is terminated, it survives and continues its mission. First, it survives the explosion of the truck. Second, it survives the explosion of itself. Finally, it is crushed and terminated by the machine in the factory.",Null,1,4,30 August 2017
Ready Player One," A mindless actioner
","I fell asleep when watching the IMAX version of this boring film. Actually I don't think it should be called a film since it does not have a plot. Instead, it is just a brutal combination of mindless actions, whether from Kong, Godzilla or Gundam. Steven Spielberg loses his composure and turns out to be Michael Bay. Surely, this is his worst film ever.",Null,3,7,14 April 2018
"I, Tonya"," Margot Robbie deserves an Oscar
","Normally, actresses got an Oscar for emotional performances, and without any doubt, Margot does brilliant emotional acting in the movie 'I, Tonya'. But at the same time, you also have to consider the difficulty of the physical performances. For a non-professional skater, it is extremely hard and nearly impossible to learn the acrobatic jumps, spins, moves and other elements in skating. I think Margot does equally well in physical performances, and really deserves an Oscar.",Null,4,10,27 December 2017
BlacKkKlansman," More like a political statement
","The film is actually a failure as a film, with a messy editing and a confusing storytelling. The story itself is also too simple and lacks credibility. The realistic scenes in the end save the film from being nothing, and this film just acts more like a political statement rather than a passable film.",Null,0,7,18 September 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Kubrick's best movie
","The film is both a thriller and a comedy. The thriller aspect is that the audience keep wondering if the nuclear attack on Russia will be stopped. The suspense starts from the first act to the last act. The comedy aspect stems from the satirical tone of the film, which is just based on innovative imagination and interesting exaggeration.",Null,1,2,16 September 2017
Pan's Labyrinth," A decent thriller with a stinking fantasy part
","I have to say that the technical aspects of the film are brilliant, including makeup, cinematography, music score, production design, visual effects and so on. The plot is also amazing. The scene that Mercedes tries to escape, and the final chase scene resulting in the death of Ofelia, are simply thrilling and breathtaking. Nonetheless, the fantasy part really stinks. The faun, the mandrake root, the toad, the Pale Man, the bugs and some other fantasy characters are just stinking, disgusting, ugly, horrifying and awful, which largely undermines the beauty of the fantasy world.",Null,0,2,17 September 2017
Alien," An everlasting masterpiece
","The 1979 film 'Alien' is an everlasting masterpiece for three reasons. The first is its visual effects. The spaceship looks real. The 'alien' is also believable since most of its body is in shadow and it is only partially visible to humans. The second is its creation of an intense atmosphere. The movie uses a slow build-up approach, and gradually increases the tension, terror and suspense. The third is the stellar performance of Sigourney Weaver, who becomes a star after the release of this film.",Null,0,2,11 September 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A formulaic spy thriller
","The film The Winter Soldier is not a typical superhero movie or a normal Marvel film, as it contains plenty of elements from hard-hitting old-school spy thrillers. However, it suffers the same clichÃ©s a superhero movie usually does. Steve Rogers, or Captain America is just immortal, and prevails no matter what happens to him. The supervillain just fails for no obvious reasons, or because he needs to be failed.",Null,1,3,20 May 2018
Barry Lyndon," A mesmerizing epic
","Despite the length of the film being more than three hours, my eyes have never stayed away from the screen. The production design, visual effects, cinematography, hairstyle and makeup, costume design, music score, are just marvelous and breathtaking. Kubrick simply proves again why he is one of the greatest directors of all time. The elegant two-act structure and the beautiful long double shots ending with a slow backwards zoom were groundbreaking in filmmaking. If you want to learn filmmaking, just watch Kubrick.",Null,2,5,21 February 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," The best drama of the last decade
","'Three Billboards' is a funny, thrilling and heartfelt journey about life, understanding and forgiveness. Actually, very few movies can be funny, thrilling and heartfelt at the same time, and this is surely a great achievement by this movie. The screenplay, acting, directing, music score, soundtrack, cinematography, makeup and production design are undoubtedly perfect and top-notch. Frances McDormand has long established herself as one of the best actresses of all time, and in this movie, she exhibits incredible abilities in line deliveries, facial expressions and body movements. Sam Rockwell also shines throughout the movie by perfectly playing a retarded yet heartwarming cop, and shows a clear transition. The music score is sensational, especially when the three billboards gets burned. The cinematography sometimes mimics one's gaze and is amazing. The screenplay is genius in the sense that you never know what is going to happen next. There are several moments that are simply unforgettable and touching. For example, Red forgives about Dixon, who beats him up, and offers him a cup of orange juice. Also, Dixon forgives Mildred, who burns him, and says 'who else could it be'. Mildred forgives his ex- husband, who burns her billboards, and does not throw the bottles on him. James covers up Mildred's crime and makes a dating story. The worker offers to rebuild Mildred's billboards after they are burned. An interesting thing in the movie is the two letters of Willoughby, one to Dixon and one to Mildred. In fact, the letter to Dixon changes his personality, and it really shocks me that when he gets burned, he still thinks of protecting the case files of Angela Hayes. All in all, this is definitely the best film of 2017, and possibly the best of the last decade.",Null,3,11,13 November 2017
Pacific Rim," A disgusting monster film
","Del Toro is disgusting as ever. The design of the monster is awful. The visual effects look utterly fake. The action sequences, plot and setup are all unconvincing. The storytelling is a mess.",Null,0,4,7 May 2019
Ant-Man," An average Marvel film
","The setting of this film is pretty interesting, which is the microscopic world of ants and ant-man. The visual effects of this setting is believable. However, the story just follows a completely predictable routine, and does not offer anything new. If you missed this film for some reason, you do not have to regret at all.",Null,0,3,3 June 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," The most overrated film of 2018
","The film is probably OK from a music point of view, but is simply a disaster in filmmaking aspects. The editing is a mess. There are some scenes connected quite awkwardly, and the transition of the central figure Freddie is quite rigid. The character development is highly problematic as well. The supporting roles are flat and one-dimensional. The storytelling is too direct and takes a lot of shortcuts. Most of the dialogues are not well-written.In one word, the film could have been much improved if a professional director and screenwriter had been hired.",Null,30,45,27 January 2019
North by Northwest," An almost perfect action thriller
","Unlike most of the Hitchcock films that spend a lot of time on the build-ups, 'North by Northwest' is intense from the start to the end. In Act 1, Thornhill is mistaken for a CIA agent and is chased by foreign spies. The police think he kills a UN diplomat and also chase after him. In Act 2, Thornhill gets the help from Kendall and successfully avoids the police. In Act 3, Thornhill is almost killed by a crop duster plane, and knows that Kendall works for the foreign spies. In Act 4, Thornhill is told by the CIA that Kendall is actually an agent of CIA, and saves her from the foreign spies. Of course, the final chase scene on Mount Rushmore is the most gripping one. But there are plenty of other action sequences before that. Most notably, the crop duster plane chase scene outside Chicago is quite thrilling.",Null,1,5,4 September 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A confusing mess
","Most of the characters are unoriginal, and are plagiarized from previous work. For instance, the villain Octavius is copied from the 2004 stunner Spider-Man 2. Also, there is a girl character from Japanese cartoon. The motivation of the movie is confusing, too. It is really unnecessary to make such a movie. Perhaps it is politically correct to think : why does the spider-man have to be a white? It could also be a black. OK, why does Jesus Christ have to be a white? He could also be a black. Well, cash grab should be another motivation, as Sony does not have much IP. Besides, the premise, or setting, of the film is unconvincing. Why would there be multiple universes?",Null,63,297,15 December 2018
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Magnificent in every way
","Terminator 2: Judgment Day is the best Sci-Fi movie of all time. It is also the all-time greatest actioner, and the finest all-time thriller. It is the best movie made by James Cameron and the best played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. It is the greatest sequel of all time. The action sequence is intense and breathtaking. The visual effect is amazing and splendid. The emotion between T-800 and John is resonant and touching. The music score is fantastic and extraordinary. The sound is wonderful and sensational. In a nutshell, the movie is magnificent in every way.",Null,1,4,24 August 2017
Silver Linings Playbook," A well-written and solidly-acted romantic comedy
","I have to say that every actor in this movie is brilliant, Cooper, Lawrence, Tucker, Weaver, and most noticeably De Niro. They all should have won some awards for their performances. The screenplay is fantastic, particularly in lines and jokes. The plot is a little bit predictable but still quite convincing. The standard four-act structure makes the movie rather accessible, even by the most common moviegoers, and that's why the film got a really high revenue.",Null,1,2,2 July 2018
Face_Off," The best action film by the best action director
","This movie simply shows why John Woo is the top action director of the last three decades, who reshapes the Hong Kong cinema and highly influences the American cinema. The action sequences are brilliant and well-choreographed as always. The plane chase in the first act, and the Mexican standoff and the speedboat chase in Act 4, are absolutely thrilling and astonishing. John Travolta and Nicholas Cage both give their career-best performances, in the sense that each of them has to play the role of the other actor and that they superbly make it.",Null,4,7,17 September 2017
Dunkirk," Nolan deserves an Academy Award for Best Director
","There is a folklore saying that every movie made by Christopher Nolan should win him an Oscar Best Director. But in reality this is not the case. In fact, Nolan is yet to receive an Oscar nomination for directing. To tell the truth, the Academy were seldom, if not never, in favor of a thriller, a sci-fi, or a superhero movie. Even great names like Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, or Ridley Scott were unable to break this unwritten rule. However, war films are different. Steven Spielberg's two Best Director awards are accomplished through movies both set in World War II. The Vietnam War Trilogy of Oliver Stone twice win him the Oscar. Obviously, Dunkirk is among the greatest war films of all time,and is absolutely no worse than names like Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, Schindler's List, or Saving Private Ryan.",Null,59,125,17 July 2017
Aliens," Even better than its predecessor
","James Cameron is just a born genius in filmmaking, who always improves the sequel over the original film. 'Terminator 2' is better than 'The Terminator', and here 'Aliens' exceeds 'Alien'. So there are reasons to expect that 'Avatar 2' is upgraded from 'Avatar'. First of all, the visual effects are improved in 'Aliens'. In 'Alien', due to the technology limits, only part of the alien is shown to the audience. But here in 'Aliens', a full-sized alien is filmed. Secondly, the emotion of 'Aliens' is stronger than that in 'Alien' because of the new character Newt.",Null,4,8,12 September 2017
Dallas Buyers Club," McConaughey is awesome
","McConaughey has always been an amazing actor, and this 2013 bio thriller Dallas Buyers Club marks his career-best performances, even one of the best among all the Oscar winners. He just reminds me of Day-Lewis' acting in There Will Be Blood. The direction of this film is somehow awkward. The first forty minutes is kind of loose and off-topic, and just leads to nowhere. However, after the first forty minutes, the real tension begins. Both the struggle between the life and death, and the conflict between Woodroof and FDA, hold the attention of the audiences towards the end. This film is set in the 1980s but still resonates today. The medical systems in the United States has been problematic for a very long time, in the sense that the capitalists can easily maneuver the FDA to sell their drugs and to ban other competing drugs.",Null,1,2,26 June 2018
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Somehow disappointing
","There are two story lines in this movie 'Days of Future Past': one line happening in the future and the other set in the 1970s. Logan is the only character that experiences both the future and the past.The past part is above average, both in story and visual effects. The cinematography and the production design of the 1970s are realistic, and the performances of Jackman and McAvoy are impressive. However, the role Erik, or Magneto is just confusing, who does very little contribution to pushing forward the plot. It seems that the time given to the character is too much. On the other hand, the future part is just cheap and lousy, particularly the visual effects, and is much like a third-tier Japanese movie. I do not understand the meaning of the character 'Blink'. And the actress who plays it, Fan Bingbing, is just like a clown.",Null,0,2,22 May 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America 3 turns out to be Iron Man 4

Spirited Away," The most overrated animated film ever
","First of all, this film is not for all ages. With so many frightening horror images and disgusting monster characters, it should be rated NC-17.Secondly, the plot lacks credibility. Haku, No-Face and Zeniba, especially Haku, are nice and helpful to Sen just for no reasons. Thirdly, there is no clear objective or aim throughout the film. Sen does not know how to return to the human world with her parents. It is not until the very end that Haku comes up with a solution. All in all, this is probably the most overrated film of all time, and Hayao Miyazaki is arguably the most undeserving director ever.",Null,7,32,14 September 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Neither self-contained nor original
","The film has too many references to previous Marvel films, and is not friendly to those who are not Marvel fans. General audiences may easily get confused: what is this and why is that? The story is not original either. We have seen too many time-travel films, such as Back to the Future and Days of Future Past. This film does not offer anything new.

Avengers: Infinity War," A tedious and dependent film
","SPOILER: The plot is simple that the supervillian succeeds, but Russo brothers waste too much time on piling up the superheroes.

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino meets realism
","This is a typical Tarantino style film, violent and funny. The jokes are throughout the film and the violence steps in when dealing with hippies.

The soundtrack is also memorable. All in all, this is just another crown jewel from Pixar.",Null,0,3,24 December 2017
1917," Immersive and traumatizing
","The film follows a standard four-act narrative structure. Each act has only one shot, which, as you can imagine, is an extremely long take. The cinematographers and production designers must have done some impossible work.Under this immersive and atmospheric setup, you see what the protagonists saw, hear what the protagonists heard, and feel what the protagonists felt. This is one of the most realistic, intense and hard-hitting thrillers I've ever seen. That's why I don't recommend this movie. You will be traumatized by the film, even long after you finish watching it.",Null,27,55,26 December 2019
Lincoln," A well-made and deeply affecting historical drama
","The film 'Lincoln' brings us back to a defining moment in the American history, namely the pass of the Thirteenth Amendment; and tells about the last four months' life of Abraham Lincoln, one of the most beloved American presidents. It is definitely one of the best historical drama ever, thanks to its brilliant screenplay, original score, acting performances, costume, production design, hair/makeup, and cinematography. The several monologues and speeches delivered by Daniel Day-Lewis is among the finest moments of his splendid acting career. Adam Driver, who was unknown at the time of shooting, plays a minor role in the film, which is sort of interesting. All in all, this is a must-see film for every American.",Null,1,2,11 February 2018

","This film, 'Children of men', represents the highest level of filmmaking. It is one of the most realistic Sci-Fi thrillers of all time, thanks to its amazing technical accomplishment in cinematography, sound mixing, music score, film editing, sound editing, and visual effects. At the same time, it is thought-provoking and successful in the screenplay and the storytelling, serving as a fantastical cautionary tale and making every viewer emotionally resonant. By making such a masterpiece, which is even better than 'Gravity', Alfonso Cuarón simply proves himself to be one of the best directors of all time.",Null,2,4,9 February 2018
Million Dollar Baby," A really good one
","This is perhaps the greatest sport movie of all time. The screenplay successfully avoids the usual genre cliches, and is suspensefully and sensitively executed. The performances from Swank, Eastwood and Freeman are gritty and nuanced. The music score is memorable. It is just perfect in every possible measure.",Null,0,2,23 July 2018
Big Hero 6," A rip-off of Iron Man and Spider-Man 2
","The quality of the film is actually not bad. In particular, the animation is pretty cool. The plot is OK too, with some twists and turns. However, I would give it a 0/10 rating due to plagiarism. Some of its action scenes are simply copied from the 2008 thriller Iron Man and the 2004 stunner Spider-Man 2.",Null,2,7,14 April 2019
Ip Man," Chain punches from Donnie Yen
","This martial arts film is famous for its well-choreographed fight sequences. In a fight with ten Japanese samurai, the martial artist Donnie Yen displays his truly brilliant fighting ability. In particular, he punches the same person many times very fast in a extremely short period of time. It is called 'chain punches', which is invented by Donnie Yen.",Null,0,1,10 September 2017
Jurassic World," Just a remake of Jurassic Park
","Almost every idea of this movie 'Jurassic World' is copied from its 1993 original Jurassic Park. Even the characters are the same: one male protagonist, one female protagonist, two children and some stupid guys. It is a shame that today filmmakers have lost their pioneering spirit and just rely on sequel, reboot or remake of existing intellectual properties for cash grab purposes.",Null,1,3,11 June 2018
The Insider," Al Pacino stuns us again
","Even as of today, I still cannot understand why Al Pacino has only won the Oscars once. Obviously, for his unbelievable talent, he should have won more and much more than that. He is forever an American treasure, one of the most beloved stars, and one of the greatest actors of all time. This film 'The Insider' uses a slow-building approach, which culminates in a stunning last 30 minutes. The several outbursts of the character Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) clearly show that Al Pacino has the best line delivery ever. Even Tom Hanks or Jimmy Stewart could not reach that level. Lowell Bergman, representing integrity, remains one of the most memorable characters in American cinema.",Null,3,4,23 February 2018
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A remarkable screenplay with a crappy storytelling
","The screenplay is undoubtedly smart and imaginative, with a quite interesting and fun premise on memory erasure. However, the movie is not executed well, particularly in the storytelling. The nonlinear storytelling is just unnecessary, making the movie chaotic and confusing. Also, most of the time is put in the memory erasing process of Joel (Jim Carrey), and this unbalanced narration further exacerbates the film.",Null,1,4,14 February 2018
Up," A cool and funny adventure
","This film, 'Up', presents an colorful and imaginative world, with an interesting story and a couple of full-bodied characters. The voice performances, original score and the animation are also notable. For its stunning visual, and cool and funny adventure, 'Up' is a family-friendly masterpiece for all ages.",Null,0,1,24 February 2018
Rocky," Great filmmaking and great American dream
","From the perspective of filmmaking, the movie is simply great. The cinematography, screenplay and editing are phenomenal. The storytelling takes on a slow-building, or Hitchcock-style approach. If you just watch the first half, you might think it is yet another romance movie or a biopic. The sport scene, or the climax only comes at the last ten minutes, which is absolutely classic and memorable. Besides, the message about American dream passed on by the film, namely everybody can achieve something extraordinary, is even more impressive. Rocky may lose the match, but he never compromises and refuses to give up. Clearly he is a winner.",Null,0,1,3 February 2018
The Shape of Water," A visually stunning thriller
","I'm a fan of thriller movies, and among all the thrillers I've ever seen, 'The Shape of Water' is definitely one of the best in terms of visuals. The cinematography, production design, visual effects, and music score are all top-notch, making the viewing experience rather pleasant. It is surely a strong contender in the technical categories of the coming Oscars. The acting performances are also noteworthy. Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins and Michael Stuhlbarg all give unforgettable and natural acting. Michael Shannon proves again why he is one of the best actors in his generation by perfectly playing the villain. The storytelling and character development, on the other hand, are not that satisfying. Overall speaking, the pace is fine and taut. But the third act is overlong, and some interactions between 'the thing' and humans (after people rescue 'the thing' from the lab) are completely unnecessary. The director may try to make the audiences emotionally resonant, but fails in the end. The love between Elisa and 'the thing' looks especially strange: no human wants to make love with a monster. The character development is largely disappointing in the sense that almost every character is flat and one-dimensional. All in all, I would give the film a 75/100 rating.",Null,32,61,26 December 2017
It's a Wonderful Life," Thought-provoking, heart-warming, and tear-shedding
","Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest movies of all time. When you are unhappy, watch it. When you are in trouble, watch it. When you think of suicide, watch it. It will make you happy immediately. Act 1 shows that George Bailey helps a lot of people, starting from his childhood. In the second act, George gets married. These two acts are the build-ups. It becomes tense in the third act, where Uncle Bailey loses eight thousand bucks and George faces bankruptcy and imprisonment. Act 4 comes the climax, in which an angle shows to George how others' lives would be different without George. When all the people in town give money to help George through the crisis, I am moved and burst into tears.",Null,0,1,3 September 2017
Psycho," Not so horrifying
","To be honest, the movie is not that horrifying. The famous shower scene is bloody but not scary. The scene that the corpse of Norman's mother is discovered is more terrifying. Overall speaking, without supernatural things typically existed in a horror movie, 'Psycho' is not so horrifying. It is not mysterious as well, since it is not hard to guess that Norman kills Marion. The movie is just an quintessential Hitchcock thriller. The climax lies in the last twenty minutes, during which the audience will hold their breath and keep wondering what happen next. Anthony Perkins performs extremely well in the movie. His tone of speaking is a little like that of Andrew Garfield.",Null,0,1,1 September 2017
American Made," A disastrous film
","I don't understand Tom Cruise agreed to star in such a mediocre film. Obviously he should take on more serious roles, like the Vietnam war veteran in Born on the Fourth of July, or he could make more entertaining films, such as the Mission Impossible franchise. This film, American Made, uses a rather superficial way to approach a somehow 'legendary' figure Barry Seal in the history. There are just too many voice-overs, which certainly interrupts the pace of the film. The character development fails completely and you never know what the protagonist is thinking. It is neither serious enough nor entertaining enough to make a hit.",Null,2,5,3 February 2018
Mudbound," The buildup is too long
","I cannot deny that the movie 'Mudbound' is a sentimental and thought-provoking period drama. But at the same time, I have to point out that the buildup, or the first act is really overlong, lasting for more than an hour. The central figures in the film are Jamie and Ronsel, who served in the US military and are against racism. But their story only starts after the one hour mark, at which point the audience get bored and tired. The film would be much improved if the buildup were shortened.",Null,0,3,27 December 2017
There Will Be Blood," Day-Lewis is simply the best actor of all time
","There is no other actor that could be like Daniel Day-Lewis, whose performance is just impeccable, in the sense of either line delivery, body language, facial expression or whatever. He is the God of acting. The complexity and depth he shows in the movie 'There will be blood' will never be surpassed. Every confrontation between Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano is mesmerizing and unforgettable.",Null,0,2,19 September 2017
Jaws," Worse than Alien
","Inevitably, we have to compare Jaws and Alien, two of the most significant horror-thrillers in the 1970s. Unfortunately, Jaws is worse than Alien. Particularly, jump scare in Jaws is a much cheaper and lousier approach than the atmospheric or slow-building approach in Alien. Also, the plot or story of Alien are much more reasonable and compelling than that in Jaws. Besides, the visual effects in Alien is better and smarter than Jaws.",Null,2,29,20 August 2018
WALL·E," Just speechless
","The movie 'Walle' is arguably the greatest animated film of all time, stuns us in every possible way, and simply proves that only the sky is the limit for Pixar's imagination. Visually astonishing and narratively satisfying, deeply heartfelt and profoundly thought-provoking, the film serves both as a touching romance between two robots and also as a cautionary sci-fi set in the future. It has been and will be relevant and significant by straightforwardly reminding us of humanity and love.",Null,0,2,12 February 2018
Marriage Story," The most poignant and depressing film of the year
","The film is impeccable in terms of screenplay, direction, performances, editing and music score. The quarreling scene between Driver and Johansson is possibly one of the best scenes of the last decade. The ending scene echoes the opening scene and just makes the film an instant classic.",Null,18,34,18 November 2019
Raging Bull," One of the most overrated films of all time
","In the film 'Raging Bull', Robert De Niro's performance is just brilliant, and clearly shows the jealousy and obsession of the central character Jake La Motta. Apart from that, there is not much to say about the film. The storytelling is unbalanced, with not enough time on the later post-boxing stage. The transition of the character Jake is somehow strange and unnatural. Just like most of Martin Scorsese's films, 'Raging Bull' is largely overrated.",Null,3,13,6 February 2018
X-Men: First Class," A ridiculous reboot
","To be honest, the first three fourths of the movie are acceptable and decent, and worth at least 6/10. Nevertheless, the last quarter becomes total junk. The villain suddenly dies, and the Soviets and the Americans turn from enemy into friends in just no time. The transition is rather weird. The more ridiculous thing is that Magneto transforms from hero to villain without any warning. In some sense, the movie 'First Class' fails to a great extent in plot and character development.",Null,0,3,24 May 2018
Iron Man," The best superhero movie of all time
","With a twisted story, fast-paced storytelling, breathtaking visual effects, and winning performances from Robert Downey Jr., this sensational superhero origin still thrills me ten years after the release. It reminds me of James Cameron's Sci-Fi classic 'The Terminator'. In fact, 'Iron Man' was the reason why Marvel Cinematic Universe has been successful for the last ten years, as it set an extremely high bar for the Marvel films after it, though no Marvel films have ever come close to it. Also, this film is the reason why 'Iron Man' has become the most popular fictional character originated from comic books, even more popular than iconic figures like Superman, Batman or Spider-man. Robert Downey Jr. should have had won the Best Actor Award for his performance in the film if it were not a blockbuster.",Null,0,2,5 June 2018
X2: X-Men United," An engrossing thriller
","The first half of the film is particularly gripping and dark, and holds the attention of the audience all the time. It is intense, fast and gut-wrenching, and belongs to the best thrillers. The villain seems invincible, and is about to kill all the mutants. The second half of the film is slower and more predictable. The villain's power suddenly disappears and is easily killed by the mutants. This half makes a mistake most of the superheroes movies do. Overall, it is still a decent movie worth watching.",Null,0,1,31 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars is dead
","The only merit of this film, I would say, is the return of Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, which reminds us of our childhood memory. The casting is a disaster. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Adam Driver are much worse than I thought, with zero charisma and questionable acting. Harrison Ford, even at his seventies, beats them all quite easily, and simply proves that he is one of the greatest actors of all time. However, Ford is too expensive and his character has to be killed to save expenditure. Anyway, cash grab is the only motivation of Disney.The plot lacks credibility, and some scenes are just ridiculous. The set pieces, action sequences, and visual effects are copied from previous star wars films. The screenplay is also the same as the Star Wars Trilogy from 1977 to 1983, focusing on the conflict between a father and his son. First Order, has no difference with Empire.In some sense, this is just a remake of star wars, and is with much worse actors.",Null,7,13,21 June 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," An over hyped film
","Is this film good? Yes. Is this film that good? No. This is a film that was overrated by the audiences and the critics. The set pieces, visual effects, or plot are worse than those in Star Wars or The Lord of The Rings. Perhaps the film is just made for the fans, instead of the general audiences. The Harry Potter novel is brilliant, while the film is not.",Null,0,3,19 June 2018
Rear Window," A typical Hitchcock movie
","First, long setup and short climax. The setup phase (about 90 minutes) may make you bored. But the climax (the last 20 minutes) really let you hold your breath. Second, a happy ending. Hitchcock never let a tragedy happen in the end. By the way, Lisa, played by Grace Kelly, is the best girlfriend one can dream of. She is smart, beautiful, brave, kindhearted and devoted. The Hitchcock movies I like are as follows: 1. The 39 steps 2. Stage Fright 3. Strangers on a Train 4. Rope 5. The Lady Vanishes 6. Rear Window",Null,1,2,25 August 2017
Godzilla," An unsatisfying sci-fi thriller

Thus character development fails. Fortunately, the action sequences and the visual effects are fine.",Null,0,0,29 April 2019
Heat," Career-best performances from Pacino and De Niro
","The movie succeeds in a spectacular fashion. The gunfight outside the bank is absolutely stunning, which is among the bloodiest and the most violent shootouts in the history of cinema. The cinematography is simply amazing, especially the long take at Charlene's house. More importantly, the two lead stars, Pacino and De Niro, give the finest performances of their entire career. As we all know, Pacino and De Niro are two of the best actors of all time, and both of them are specialists on crime films. Most notably, Pacino appears in crime movies like 'The Godfather' franchise, 'Dog Day Afternoon', 'Scarface', 'Carlito's Way', 'Donnie Brasco', and De Niro has played in 'Mean Streets', 'Taxi Driver', 'The Godfather 2', 'Once upon a time in America', 'Goodfellas', and various other crime thrillers. And it is in 'Heat' that their acting is the most poignant and gripping. For the shortcoming of the film, I think it should be that the film is too long. Some characters are not necessary. Some scenes are distracting. If the film is more focused, I think it could be better.",Null,1,3,6 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Still stunning as of today
","The music score, story, and editing of this film A New Hope is among the best I've ever seen, even as of today, and you can hardly find a film better in these aspects. The sound editing is also truly world-class. The visual effects and action sequences may be out of date from the point of view of present, but definitely groundbreaking at the time of release.",Null,0,1,28 June 2018
Deadpool," A solid origin
","The 2016 box office hit Deadpool tells the origin story of the antihero Deadpool. The performance of Ryan Reynolds is stunning, and turns a potentially disgusting or scaring character into a likable one. The film would have become a failure if it were another actor. Deadpool is a nobody in comic books but an instant success in the film industry, largely thanks to the underlying comedic tone. People began to realize that R-rated non-family-friendly movies could be even more popular than PG-13 ones if they were entertaining enough.",Null,0,2,20 May 2018
Green Book," The most entertaining movie of 2018
","The ride is surprisingly smooth and enjoyable, with an underlying comedic tone on a serious subject. The two leads are incredible. They do not play their roles, but actually are their roles. Mortensen should win the Oscar Best Actor, and Ali should win the Oscar Best Supporting Actor. They are both among the best actors of the country.",Null,5,10,2 January 2019
The Great Escape," Fantastic second half despite problematic first half
","The first half of the movie 'The Great Escape', namely the build-up for the escape, is slow and overlong. Also, some scenes lack credibility in the sense that the Germans are too nice to the allied prisoners. The second half, that is to say, the escape process, is much more taut, realistic and breathtaking. The plot is beyond the expectation of the audience, which makes perhaps the greatest prison break film of all time.",Null,1,2,20 September 2017
Annihilation," A haunting Sci-Fi horror
","This is a haunting Sci-Fi horror movie, and it would still haunt you long after you finish the film. The atmospheric approach throughout the film, and the open ending make it a true masterpiece.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A breathless Sci-Fi thriller
","This brilliant Sci-Fi thriller, 'Empire Strikes Back', simply showcases why Star Wars has been the most influential film franchise for the last forty years. It is just impeccably constructed. The production design, set pieces, action sequences, visual effects, sound editing and music score are among the best of all time. The editing, story and performances are also fascinating, and keeps the breath of the audiences all the time. For this particular installment full of imagination, only the sky is the limit.",Null,1,2,19 June 2018
Incredibles 2," Disney makes every movie a comedy
","Under Disney, star wars becomes comedy, marvel becomes comedy, and now pixar also becomes comedy. Actually I am not a hater of comedy, but too many jokes or too much humor just slow down the pace and distract/shatter the main plot. Comedy may be a good form for cash grab, which is exactly what Disney is looking for, but is not definitely suitable for all films and should be properly controlled.",Null,151,319,18 June 2018
Inside Llewyn Davis," An interesting one-man show
","Oscar Isaac is great, whose performances in this film is pivotal. The whole film centers around his titular role and the character development is pretty successful. The plot is disposable but quite consistent. It is like an anthology film. The music is not bad. Oscar Isaac gives both great musical performances and emotional performances.",Null,0,0,19 February 2019
Back to the Future," Probably the best sci-fi comedy ever
","The story of the film is groundbreaking, with tons of follow-up films imitating this one, particularly X-men: Days of the Future Past.

Goodfellas," A mostly overrated gangster film
","I am really disappointed at the plot. When I watch some truly amazing gangster films, such as 'The Godfather' and 'The Departed', I am genuinely astonished by the stories. Unfortunately, 'Goodfellas' is not one of them. There is no main event, and all the 'small' events seem to be very straightforward. No wonder Martin Scorsese did not receive the Oscar until 2006.",Null,0,5,15 September 2017
The Birds," The best horror thriller of all time
","This is a flawless film made by Alfred Hitchcock. The trademark camera-work of Hitchcock, namely the use of camera movement that mimics a person's gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of voyeurism, is used again and again in the film, and really gives the audience an authentic feeling. The sound editing and the visual effects are perfect, in the sense that the birds attack looks utterly real. Tippi Hedren delivers an impeccable performance on her screen debut. The directing is just amazing in terms of slow build-up and suspense creation.",Null,1,3,7 October 2017
Jurassic Park," Simply stunning
","This film offers a stuning sequence of sheer thrills in the last thirty minutes, and its visual effects look utterly real, both for dinasours and the computer systems.
