It," Much Ado about Nothing.
","Everyone was excited about this movie and so was I. The trailer was intense and the whole thing that the book ,the movie is based on , was written by Stephen King really attrated viewers. Sadly the movie turned out to be almost funny at some scenes rather than scary. Such a disapointment.",5,0,1,3 October 2018
The Birds," Good movie but maybe overrated.
",Although I love Alfred Hitchcock's movies I think that birds is an overrated movie. Sure the actors are great the scenery is beautiful and overall it is a very well-made film but I think there are plot holes. For instance I believe that it should have been explained why the birds attacted people or give at least some details on that because it was the main story. To sum up I think that the film is based on good actors and great director but they forgot about the plot.,7,0,0,4 October 2018
