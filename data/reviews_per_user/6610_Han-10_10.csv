The Blair Witch Project," A new way in WITCH to see
","Ah, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.A revolutionary film.  It tells a story the way no film ever has. Presented as a edited version of found footage, the filmmakers successfully created reality cinema.  Undoubtedly influenced (if even subconsciously) by 'Cops' and the myriad other shows categorized as 'reality TV,' BLAIR WITCH tells its story from a cameraman's perspective.  In this case, the cameramen are more than just voyeurs; they are active participants in the unfolding action.  We believe that they'd keep the cameras rolling to document their strange and terrifying predicament.  We believe the characters are real as the superlative three actors never slip up and remind us that it's just a movie.  We believe in the sounds coming from the woods, and we try to decipher them, to make sense of them.  We do this in spite of the fact the most of us know through reading articles that it was just the film's producers making scary noises.It's so easy to buy into THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT because it is a simulation of reality.  No music, no cutaways, no special effects, no professional photography.  No film conventions at all -- only 'home video' conventions. It's a presentation of edited found footage left to us to determine what happened to this doomed threesome.  Like it or not, BLAIR WITCH has introduced a new way to believe in the movies.  And if you don't believe me, just ask someone from Burkittesville, MD.Grade: A",9,1,1,8 August 1999
Ghost," Good premise; mediocre execution
","'Ghost' is a decent film overall, but for every good moment, there's an equally bad one. It takes an interesting premise of a man returning as a ghost after his murder and muddles it with a rather silly money laundering plot. Many actions of the villains, and the reactions of side characters to various goings-on, are unbelievable.Would the banker hand Ode Mae a cashier's check for $4 million dollars after she acts like a complete lunatic and more than a tad suspicious? And why is that bank scene so padded and long? The 'comic relief' it provides isn't worth its extreme lack of credibility.Could the killer, Willie Lopez, be less sneaky? He's always after Ode Mae with guns blazing even though he's a hired killer and practiced burglar. I just can't believe, even with Sam's help, that Ode Mae could avoid this guy catching up with her eventually.As for Carl, he has to be one of the most unbelievable villains I've ever seen in a film. There's absolutely nothing about him that would suggest he's capable of plotting a murder. Not only is the actor miscast, but the character is so underdeveloped, it reminds me of movies I'd make with my friends with a video camera when we were in junior high school.A few other things that bothered me: <ul><li>The subway ghost goes from psychotic to helpful in an instant.</li></ul><ul><li>The policewoman who coldly dismisses Moore after she tells a fairly convincing story about things Ode Mae told her. Even if she isn't convinced, would she be so rude to a recent widow that she believes has been conned? </li></ul><ul><li>Demi Moore's hearing seems to go on the fritz a few times also. She can't hear Willie Lopez sprinting out of her apartment after the cat attacks him? She can't hear Carl talking to and threatening Sam in the kitchen while she's out of the room for a moment (she returns to the room after the rather loud argument and says, 'Were you talking to someone?' He drops a large knife out the counter (clink!) which she doesn't hear or notice when she's 5 feet away from him.)</li></ul><ul><li>If ghosts are capable of moving things around with ease, wouldn't there be a more widespread phenomenon of such occurrences? Or are Swayze and the subway ghost the only ones who have ever figured it out? For a movie that tries so hard to be serious, there are far too many of these things to write off as suspension of disbelief.</li></ul>I did find a some clever or satisfying bits in the film, like the floating penny, some of Swayze's learning curve of what he can do as a ghost, and the idea of the demons dragging evil-doers to their ultimate punishment (although the special effects fail here).It's sounds like I despised this film, but I still gave it a 6 because despite its many flaws, it still entertains and the flaws aren't as glaring on the first viewing. Those who generally enjoy love stories or find pleasure (even guilty ones) in Lifetime Original Movies will more easily overlook the bad stuff.Lastly, the performances are mediocre at best. Goldberg does the best job of anyone, but the writing is too silly to make her character truly believable. Swayze does his best work here, and it's still not so great. Moore cries a lot. Goldberg didn't deserve an Oscar in my opinion, and the film itself certainly didn't deserve its win for Writing or a Best Picture nod.Grade: C+",6,12,26,28 February 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," #1
","Everybody knows that 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is one of the greatest films ever made.  I almost feel like I'm wasting my time commenting further on it. However, since I rank it at #1, I feel the need to justify it.The amount of talent on board the filmmaking staff is staggering, and the film benefits most from their inspiring of each other.  Steven Spielberg's direction is impeccable.  He has an unparalleled ability to visually tell a story.  Clearly this man was put on Earth to make films.  Together with the creative mind of George Lucas, the great scripting of Lawrence Kasdan, and the masterful musical score from the master himself, John Williams, Spielberg makes us a part of the experience to the point where we forget we are watching a movie.  And let's not forget Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Can you imagine how much the picture would have lost had Tom Selleck, the original star of the film, had stayed on instead of Ford?  Ford's expressions, deliveries, and general mannerisms make the character his own. No matter the incredible and often superhuman tasks he pulls off, he's still just a regular Joe that with whom we can empathize.'Raiders' can be viewed again and again while the viewer's interest never fades.  It stops channel surfing in a heartbeat, despite editing and commercials.  When it's on, I'm just plain glad that I'm watching it.  It is perfect right down to the famous final shot (which tips its hat to the Godfather of American film: 'Citizen Kane').  What more can I say that hasn't already been said?  It is my favorite film.Grade:  A+",10,1,2,6 February 2000
Final Destination 2," A Lame Sequel to a Lame Original
","*Spoilers, discusses plot points*After the initial car crash scene, I understood what I was in for.  Pure ridiculous mayhem, completely hilarious because it's so over-the-top and unrealistic.  Also clear, this movie wouldn't scare me at all.  Terrible dialogue and generic characters.  There's also no genuine sense of dread that follows the characters around.  They just move from one plot point to the next seeming to forget all about the young boy (for example) they saw splattered into an oblivion by a falling sheet of glass (and by the way, after the said young boy had been under debilitating gas and almost choked to death in the dentist's office moments before, he sure goes after those pigeons with clear-headed gusto).  These characters are so one-dimensional that it's hard to imagine any of them existing beyond their scenes in the film.  The only fun to be had is in the gruesome death scenes - so overboard and gory, and half the fun is pointing out all the stupidity leading up to them.  The deaths occur in such absurd ways that it's impossible to be frightened - it reminds me of the violence in South Park.Overall, there's no successfully created mood or atmosphere.  It's just plot and deaths.  The characters arrive upon illogical conclusions to move to the next plot point.  You can't feel anything for the characters or get behind them emotionally, so you are unaffected by the deaths (except for laughter).So when you don't believe in any of the characters, or the situations presented, you can't place the intended themes into any Real Life context, and you're watching a movie that's not scary.  You don't feel like Death is following the characters - Death would be more subtle.  Hey! Subtly! That may have made this scarier.The movie is humorous, but I'm still debating whether it's intentional.  It has to be.  It looks like they had too much fun making the death scenes. They are the best parts of the film, while at the same time they take away from it.  It's horrible overall, but there are some parts you gotta see.  I recognize the entertainment value here, but my grade is based on the movie's (lack of) success in achieving any suspense or horror.Grade: D-",Null,1,1,28 October 2003
Cast Away," It's c**p, and it'll be a huge Oscar contender
","Here's a great idea gone wrong...SPOILERS AHEAD, NOT THAT TRAILER DIDN'T SPOIL EVERYTHING ANYWAYIt begins by saturating us with the fact that Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) lives his life on a strict schedule.  In a future BATMAN film, they would set-up the Clock King's pre-menacing days similarly.  After the first three lines of dialogue were out of Hanks' mouth, I had the entire exposition mapped out in my head.  I was half-expecting that Hanks would -- after the plane crash -- return to his wife (Helen Hunt) as a snowman.  I should note that as a JACK FROST reference only because I'm not confident that many of you have seen it (obviously, if you haven't, don't).So after the crash, Hanks floats to the island where we spend a good chunk of the movie alone with him.  Mostly good stuff here, especially when dealing with basic survival.  I was able to completely forget that Hanks was just an actor surrounded by a film crew.  The lack of music and the sustained sequences let you inside Chuck Noland's skin.  It is therefore a dreadful mistake on the part of the filmmakers to pull us out of that skin when we are starting to identify with it.  'Four years later,' says the title card.  I would have liked 15 or 20 more minutes on the island, or enough to properly transition Chuck Noland from a baffled plane crash survivor to a suicide-contemplating loon who talks to volleyballs.  And if they showed that damn stopwatch with Helen Hunt's picture one more time, I'd be overcome by nausea.  It was almost as sappy as the use of the compass in Zemeckis' CONTACT.  Same syrupy significance.Now, if you've been watching this guy rub sticks together for an hour, wouldn't it be interesting to see his rescue and his potentially jarring re-introduction to civilisation?  Let's face it, as horrible as the entire situation would be, it'd almost be worth being stranded to be rescued. It'd be like being carried off home plate after hitting the game-winning home run in Game 7 of the World Series.  What a missed opportunity to skip this emotional rollercoaster and instead plunk down another title card: 'One month later.'  Well, I want to know what that month was like.  Throw in the four years I missed and I'd be even happier.All of the events shown after Hanks' arrival home are uninteresting.  I really didn't want to know about any of it.  Zemeckis once again chose sentimentality over imagination.  We get a long kiss in a rainstorm and a cheesy 'guardian angel/freedom' symbol that dumps more sugar on the pile that the pocket-watch started.  There is no transition from rescued Hanks to recovering Hanks.  If you started watching the film from the 'One month later' title card, you'd barely think that this man spent over four years on a deserted island.Some great sequences at least make this entertaining frustration.  Less c**p, more good stuff, and smoother transitions; that would have resulted in a better film.  As Hanks would say in the similarly-flawed FORREST GUMP, 'That's all I have to say about that.'Grade: C",Null,0,0,4 January 2001
The Elephant Man," more admiration
","I thought I'd add one more note of admiration for this film.  The cinematography, direction, acting:  Fantastic.  The scene where John Merrick meets Treeves' wife is one of the most affecting I've ever seen.  It used to bother me that the true life of Merrick differed so from his character in the movie (in reality, he capitalized on his deformity).  Since I understand that liberties in the script were taken to better shape this as a lesson in humanity, I let it go.  I'm sure the real John Merrick's life was no bed of roses anyhow.'Elephant Man,' 'Ed Wood,' 'Schindler's List.'  The best modern movies seem to be shot in black and white.  I better get my a-- to the theater and see 'The Man Who Wasn't There.'Grade: A",10,0,0,3 January 2002
Garden State," Promising, but ultimately bland
","This film started off with a lot of promise.  We were clearly and humorously introduced to the character of Andrew Largeman, a 20-something completely disconnected from the world due to a lifetime of taking prescription anti-depression drugs.  However, after a certain pivotal scene in which he meets Sam (Natalie Portman), the film loses its edge and its pacing.  The dialogue goes from clever to mundane and the film works too hard to *tell* rather than *show* the alleged transition that Largeman goes through.  He starts as disconnected, then for awhile, becomes merely *mellow*, and then quite suddenly has an epiphany and is able to feel emotions again.  Perhaps with better uses of editing, pacing, and filmmaking in general, the thawing of Largeman would have come across more successfully.  Instead, I found myself increasingly disinterested with his character and began to feel like a bored psychiatrist listening to the only occasionally interesting problems of a patient.  While many of the problems could have been solved better in post-production, some problems exist within the screenplay itself as it wanders around a bit too much.It's stylistically impressive for a director's first outing (especially considering he also wrote and starred on a low budget), but I don't think it'll touch most audiences the way it obviously touches the filmmakers themselves.  There's just not enough there.It also should be noted that the performances were generally all good, especially Peter Sarsgaard as Largeman's high school buddy, and Ron Leibman's cameo as the neurologist.Grade: C-",5,0,0,6 May 2004
Back to the Future Part II," more plot, less quality
","I'm such a fan of the first film of this series that I feel compelled to address the problems of the second.  Leave it to me to only focus on the negative.  **CONTAINS SPOILERSFirst of all, the plot is much more complicated.  Sub-plots begin here and end in the 3rd movie; a result of filming the last two films back-to-back. With so much info to cram in, the dialogue becomes weighted down with too much explanation.  As a result, it sounds forced and unnatural.  The scene in the McFly's future Hilldale home comes to mind.  In this one glimpse into their daily family life, we learn that Marty wrecked his life in a Rolls-Royce accident and that his lifelong inability to back down from a dare (a particularly horrible and corny plot device -- 'Chicken?') causes one ridiculously bad decision after another.  Of course, Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer, overhears it all along with Marty's termination and his terrible guitar playing.  Very convenient, indeed.Secondly, while the story at times can be nicely constructed, some parts are lazily thrown together.  Right off the bat, Doc arrives in broad daylight to pick up Marty and Jennifer to take them to the future.  Why on earth would they have to leave right away?  They could plan for weeks and the same future would still be waiting for them.  Later, Doc says he brought Jennifer because he couldn't leave her with the information of having seen the time machine.  Who wouldn't have noticed a flying Dolorean take off from the street and implode in a ring of fire in the sky?  Apparently, we're supposed to believe that the only one left behind to notice is Biff, who had come out to (get this) show Marty his new matchbooks.  It seems the writers hadn't anticipated picking up from the epilogue of the first film and they couldn't think of a believable way to continue from there.  It doesn't end there. Why leave an unconscious Jennifer on crates in an alley?  Isn't there room in the car or ANYWHERE else?  Are we to believe that Old Biff could figure out how the time machine works: the control panel, Mr. Fusion, and the 88mph thing?  And I might as well point out that Marty appeared about 40 yards away from the car when it was stolen and replaced.  How did Doc know to pick up Marty on the roof of Biff's building?  Why does young Biff turn from misunderstood bully to an all-out psychotic, screaming after Lorraine, 'It's meant to be?'  Are you telling me that Doc couldn't land the time machine after dropping Marty off during the lightning storm?  Please!  The writers had to leave him flying around so he'd get struck by lightning and that's exactly what I thought as I was watching, and I hate thinking like that when I watch a movie!On the plus side, the film does get better when Marty and Doc return to 1955.  The quest for the Sports Almanac is a good one, turning up some nail-biting sequences.  Best of all are the revisited scenes from the first film.  It's a blast to see Marty sneak around the fringes of the action we know so well to achieve different ends.  Then again, perhaps these scenes worked best because I temporarily thought I was watching the much better first film.Grade: C-",Null,1,2,18 November 2001
The Sixth Sense," best film of the year
","In its fifth week of release, I finally got out to see 'The Sixth Sense.' I certainly wasn't intrigued by the previews (too much whispering!), but the tremendous word of mouth convinced me to go.  I am glad I did. 'The Sixth Sense' is easily the best film of the summer, if not the year. It surpasses 'The Blair Witch Project' in both chills and overall effectiveness.  It has such a sublimely quiet style both visually and aurally.  The story is put together with such craft and care, and it's appreciated even more so after the final five or ten minutes.    I have no interest in detailing the plot as the previews (and other reviews) give away too much as it is.  The less you know, the better.  The performances were terrific, especially (and I think, love it or hate it, we all agree on this one) Haley Joel Osmont's fine acting job.    Treat yourself to this eerie and rewarding movie experience.Grade: A",9,0,0,8 September 1999
V for Vendetta," Terrible
","This film is easily one of the worst I've ever had the misfortune of sitting through. Loud and overbearing, lacking in any subtly or nuance, heavy-handed message, repetitious and drawn-out. At so many points in the movie, I thought to myself, 'Ok, I get it already, please move along.' It got to a point where if it cut back to John Hurt barking at his subordinates from his giant video monitor one more time, I'd be heading for the exits.In almost all cases, I can understand why critics and/or the public enjoy a film that I dislike, but this case baffles me. I can only imagine that with such a large number of people currently in disagreement with the decisions/actions of the US government and others, a story of rebellion satiates their state of unrest.However, I fail to see the entertainment value of watching a guy who reminds me of one of the puppets from Mr. Roger's Land of Make-Believe go from The Phantom of the Opera to Betty Crocker to The Matrix's Neo, all the while prattling on using alliteration and wordplay meant to be clever and thought-provoking, but it's just tedious nonsense.It's a fiasco, folks. If you can't see that, you just want a global leadership shift so badly that it's clouded your vision of what makes a good film.As awful as one of the RoboCop sequels. To see others compare it with A Clockwork Orange makes me cry.Grade: F",1,26,58,17 March 2006
