The New World," Malick's welcome return
","From the opening shot of Q'Orianka Kilcher's Pocahontas standing in the tall grass, her arms stretched out to heaven in adoration, we know we are in Malick territory. The opening sequence of the film, almost dialog free, is trade mark Malick. We see images of an idyllic paradise on earth, native children swimming in the sea and the adults peacefully co-existing with nature. As the European ships make their appearance,Malick shows the bewilderment of the natives at the sight of such alien crafts. James Horner's minimalist score superbly builds up the sense of awe. The New World marks Terrence Malick return after 1998's The Thin Red Line. Set in Virginia in 1607, It tells the story of Sir Walter Raleigh(Christopher Plummer)'s expedition to colonize America. On the ship is rebellious soldier of fortune Jonh Smith(an impressively under-played Colin Farrel).On the first hour of the film, Smith is captured by the natives and encounters Pocahontas, the young daughter of a chieftain.They instantly make a connection which will affect the fate of both natives and settlers. Performances are generally excellent, most notoriously newcomer Kilcher's, which perfectly conveys her character's innocence and sense of wonder, and Christian Bale's in a supporting role as the kindly tobacco farmer Jonh Rolfe. The Oscar Nominated photography is breathtaking and Malick's script and direction as poetic as ever. The pace of the film-as in all of Malick's films- is very slow, but it isn't really a defect as it is an element of Malick's style. This film didn't make a dent in the box-office but is surely destined for cult status. A must see.",10,2,5,18 April 2006
Empire of the Sun," One of the greats
","This is a spectacular film which saw the arrival of Christian Bale and Spielberg as a serious film maker.The story follows Jim(Bale), a British kid who lives in the European settlement of Shangai at the outbreak of world war 2. In the middle of the confusion of the times during the Japanese invasion, Jim is separated from his parents and is forced to live by his own means in the almost deserted city.Soon enough Jim meats Basey(Malkovich), an American who's mane concern is himself, however, he sees potential in Jim and takes him under his wing.The film is very long but it captures every second of your attention to it, the acting is superb. And the score is magnificent.this is in my top five films. 10/10",10,6,13,20 July 2006
The Thin Red Line," beautiful, poetic and tough
","Terrence Malick's The Thin Red line was released in the same year as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but each film couldn't be more different. Ryan focuses on how a man's innocence dies in war, Malick's film is about how a man's soul dies in war. The thin red line is flawlessly acted, a special notion should be given to Jim Caviezel as the Kentukian Private Witt, Seann Penn as the enigmatic Welsh and Nick Nolte in a performance as good as in Affliction as Colonel Tall. The film is well paced and the voice overs really reaches the heart, specially Witt's quest for immortality. Unlike the book, Welsh is not a nutter and Witt is more Philosophical. As well the relationship between Welsh and Wiit is more like the one of Warden and Prewitt in From Here To Eternity, another book from James Jones.Brutal and Beautiful this is in my TOP FIVE FILMS OF ALL TIME. 10/10",10,0,1,31 August 2006
