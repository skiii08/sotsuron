Hereditary," An almost perfect horror film
","A movie that is as creepy as it is uncomfortable to watch. From the cinematography, to the writing, to the acting, this is an extremely well crafted horror/drama film. Ari Aster has managed to create a film that stays with you (especially when you are home alone at night) without having to rely on overused horror tropes. Milly Shapiro's portrayal of Charlie is chilling, but for me Toni Callete steals the show. There are two scenes in particular (one in her bedroom with her husband and one at a dinner table) that are some of the most authentic releases of raw emotion I have seen on film. The only real complaint I have is with an ending that seems over-explained. The clues throughout the story and the visuals of the ending were more than enough to convey what was happening without the dialogue.",9,1,2,2 July 2018
