Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Did I go see 'Jersey Girl' by mistake? (spoilers)
","There are a few traits I share with the late screen comic W.C. Fields: we've both spent time in Philadelphia, although I wouldn't use it for my epitaph; we've both indulged in fermented beverages; we're not inordinately fond of kids.  At the end of 'Kill Bill Volume 1' Bill asked Sophie 'Does she know her daughter's alive?' so I knew a 4- or 5-year-old was bound to turn up in Volume 2 at some point.  Little did I know she would take over the movie.Uma Thurman is back as Beatrix the Bride, whose name gets bleeped out once but not afterwards.  She announces during an old-time-looking black and white back-projection car ride that 'when I reach my destination, I'm gonna kill Bill.'  (Volume 1 explained her incentive.) Let me skip ahead to when that finally happens: armed with a gun (for a change) as well as her trusty Hattori Hanzo sword, she arrives at Bill's Mexican hacienda, slinks inside, steels her nerves and confronts---a little girl pointing a toy gun at her. That image (and the reaction cut to Thurman) is probably the single best thing in the movie.  After that, though, 'Kill Bill Volume 2' just .... stops .... dead.I've heard there are people who find small children endlessly fascinating, even if they're not their own.  But as I sat watching, I felt like a guest trapped with proud young parents showing home video of their offspring: 'Oh, look, there is playing with her Christmas presents, isn't that cute?  Oh look, there she is eating cereal, isn't that precious??  Oh look, there she is upchucking the cereal, isn't that the most adorable thing you've ever seen???'  Uh, no... During this more or less endless footage of 'B.B.,' not only is it not 'Kill Bill' any more, it's not even Tarantino, unless he's morphed into Kevin Smith while we weren't looking.  At one point it occurred to me maybe he was spoofing the cloyingly saccharine (mis)use of young children in movies, but probably I was grasping at straws.  I think he just found the tyke fascinating and expected we would find her likewise.  Our sinister ol' Quentin did surface briefly when Bill was prompting the girl to tell the dead fish story, apparently suggesting to Beatrix that B.B. had killers' blood in her veins; this would have tied in with the later (and also endless) Superman story.I wouldn't have minded all this so much if Volume 2 had been more of a romp to that point, more in the spirit of Volume 1, which generated great emotional momentum (immeasurably aided by Zamfir's 'Lonely Shepherd,' which I will never hear the same again) and reached a dramatic climax that had me almost salivating for what would ensue.  None of this tingling adrenaline sweep survives to Volume 2; instead Volume 2 reminded me a lot of Tarantino's earlier 'Jackie Brown,' a casually paced series of set-pieces punctuated by some out-of-the-blue violent moments.  The black and white chapel scene immediately preceding the massacre serves no purpose that I can fathom except to introduce Bill onscreen, but he seems a fairly mundane character, with a lisp yet (which he didn't have in Volume 1).  There's nothing menacing about him even though we know all these people are about to be murdered on his order.  Aside from a few pointless details (we learn the bride would be working in a record store--why not a video store, Q.T.?) the massacre remains as much a mystery as in Volume 1.  Don't suppose it was inserted just to give Sam Jackson a speaking part?Don't get me wrong, there are some effective moments in Volume 2 although they require us to accept that Beatrix has declined greatly from the hyperalert revved-up killing machine she seemed to be at the chronological end of Volume 1, driving off in the 'Pussy Wagon' having just disposed of Vernita.  Her move on Budd seems downright amateurish, allowing him to gain the upper hand even though he comes off as a cartoonish country bumpkin who doesn't even search her before he buries her alive and ties her up very sloppily--jeez, didn't he see that Ashley Judd movie where she escaped from a similar predicament?  Tarantino does a good job technically with light and sound during the burial but since we know in advance she's going to survive it, he should've come up with a more novel kind of horrible death, like maybe having all her blood drained out of her--no wait, that was in a Sherlock Holmes movie from the Forties.Others have rightly highlighted the Pai Mei and Elle Driver sequences. The former's a sly tribute to all those chop-socky flicks with the camera zooming in and the master stroking his beard etc. but the 'cruel tutelage' seems really cruel and one wonders what Bill gains from sending his young female trainees to such a school; did Elle become a more effective assassin after Pai Mei plucked her eye out? Wouldn't that screw up her depth perception?  The Beatrix/Elle death match becomes a Three Stooges cartoon and isn't even finished.  Would Beatrix leave such a loose (albeit blind) end?  But then in Volume 1 she seemed to be inviting Vernita's daughter to come after her some day....At first I wasn't going to do a review until after I'd seen Volume 2 again; I wound up seeing Volume 1 seven times and liked it better each time, but I'm not pulled to see Volume 2 again as I was Volume 1.  I know I'll have to contend with B.B. again and also the bizarre depiction of Bill who by the end seems the campiest screen villain since Dirk Bogarde in 'Modesty Blaise.'  He never seems particularly interested in killing Beatrix, doesn't seem to care much if she kills him or not.  Not only did he not spend the 4 or 5 years with B.B. indoctrinating her against Beatrix, he seems to have told her 'Mommy's asleep but she'll be back.'  That doesn't seem to square with what he told Elle on the phone in Volume 1: 'We've done a lot to her, and if she ever wakes up, we'll do a lot more....'  The final fight between them lasts about six seconds before she employs her secret 'Exploding Heart' technique---by the way, why didn't she use that earlier, such as when Budd was hovering over her and she had her hands available?  Could've saved herself the trouble of fighting her way out of the grave a la TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer....If any one line seems to sum up the whole saga, it's when the hired Asian killer with the shotgun changes her mind after she confirms Beatrix is pregnant.  She says 'Congratulations' and leaves... so even in this 'alternate movie universe' as Tarantino has called it, this 'movie that characters in my movies would go see,' girls may kick ass and all, but ultimately they're still girls, still succumb to the whole maternal-instinct thing.  Is that the kind of squishiness Tarantino remembers from his beloved 'grindhouse' days? Now if the Asian killer had said 'Congratulations' and then blasted away anyway (needing to miss of course), requiring Beatrix to kill her, THAT would have been a true grindhouse tribute.I don't even recall much of the music from Volume 2 except the Meiko Kaji tune from Volume 1.  I'll probably buy the soundtrack anyway.  Least memorable character: Michael Parks as the Mexican pimp, even though he was onscreen forever (and it felt like it).  Had nothing to do except show off his fine-Corinthian-leather accent. Most memorable character: Sid Haig as the bartender in his couple of moments.  Too bad Tarantino couldn't have let him play the obnoxious owner or something.  Most missed character from Volume 1: Sophie.  Seeing her again would've been a treat, even (or especially) missing an arm or two.  I would imagine Uma will get another Oscar nod and would deserve it even more this time around.  She IS 'Kill Bill.'  Her triple take after hearing that Bill 'overreacted' is priceless.Okay maybe Q.T. never meant this to be an issue but a lot of us are probably wondering if during the anime in Volume 1 that was supposedly a young Bill in the white suit.  Maybe he'll throw us a bone some day?  DVD?  Prequel? How 'bout it, dude.....",Null,2,5,23 April 2004
The Ring," Did Alfred Hitchcock Return from the Dead to Direct an 'X-Files' Episode?
","There are certain comments about this movie that just can't be made except to have the effect of Spoilers, so I'll save those for the end & they'll be well-marked.  The legendary Hitchcock had a device he called a 'MacGuffin,' basically the thing that kept the plot moving.  Here the MacGuffin is the mysterious videotape cassette that we already knew about from the trailer. At the outset we see a couple of teenagers (they seem to be having a 'slumber party,' except it's just the two of them) discussing the 'killer tape' & of course we know something bad is going to happen to at least one of them.   (The ensuing sequence reminded me of the beginning of 'Scream' without the dark humor.)  Then our heroine stumbles across the tape by picking it apparently randomly from among a bunch of them at a Norman Bates-type motel in the woods.  (It's the only tape that isn't labeled, maybe that drew her attention to it.)  Then she watches the tape, & so do we the audience.Ordinarily I try to avoid  second-guessing a director as I do a baseball manager, but in this case I think we shouldn't have been allowed to see the tape that early.   (For a description of the tape's contents, see the Spoiler section.)  In fact I wouldn't have let us see it until near the end. That way when Rachel, the heroine, kept seeing images resembling those on the tape, we would've had to guess as to their significance (e.g. maybe she's losing it).  Instead, though, Rachel has to dash hither & yon like Agent Scully trying to filter an objective reality (albeit a strange one) through a prism based on her common-sense, skeptical background.  Early on Rachel seems a level-headed & even saucy investigative reporter, so it's to Naomi Watts' geat credit as an actress that she gets us to buy her transition to yet another terror-stricken scream-queen.  But given how many times we get to see the tape or parts of it, the effect seems somewhat worn by the end.Okay, was this movie scary or not?  Well, ten different people could give ten different answers.  A lot of it was very creepy in the best 'X-Files' sense, enhanced by the Hitchcockian flair for suspense.  A few real kick-ass jolts (see under Spoilers).  But all told, those who found this genuinely disconcerting may not have seen as many movies as some others, because (as has been pointed out by others) almost everything in this movie has been done before, some  of it pretty recently, i.e.  'Feardotcom.'    (I'm not even taking into account this is a remake of a Japanese flick; I'm guessing most Americans haven't seen the original; I for one haven't.)HERE'S THE PART WITH THE SPOILERSThe contents of the killer videotape reminded me somewhat of Luis Bunuel's 'An Andalusian Dog' fom 1928 on which he collaborated with the Surrealist painter Dali.  It's  a series of apparently unrelated images, most of which can be connected to the short unhappy life of the spooky little girl who was murdered by her mother who later killed herself, but certain images, such as the box of fingers, seem to be there only for their own surrealist sake (Bunuel's movie had a shot of someone poking at a severed hand with a cane). The 'extended' version we see at the end is great, beginning with the shot of the well with the hand protruding from it ending with the ghost-girl actually emerging from the TV screen into the living room, that kicked ass, A+ for that.  It was so effective it made me forget the umpteen questions I had been accumulating along the way, which by the way remain unanswered, but someone wrote there's supposed to be a sequel in the works, but I think every movie has to stand alone to be judged more or less.  The scene with Watts after she'd plunged into the well also made an impression, chiefly that huge stone slab sliding into place by itself.But to be brutally frank: I'm pretty tired by now of movies with the premise of a dead person trying to communicate with the living.    Over a decade ago we had 'Ghost' with Whoopi Goldberg which spelled it out for us: if the ghost really concentrates, he or she can get his or her point across, even to the point of using a PC keyboard.  I mean, gee whiz, back in the 19th century Marley's ghost actually took the trouble to appear in front of Scrooge rattling the chains & all that, so have ghosts regressed since then or something?   In 'Beetlejuice' they just showed up: 'Hey, here we are.' Now, it seems, ghosts have to bend over backward manifesting themselves. Well, if a ghost can push nails up out of floors or knock things over or other physical stuff, why can't the ghost  just levitate a ballpoint pen onto a piece of paper & make some damn words, like MY BODY CAN BE FOUND AT SUCH & SUCH LOCATION, TAKE THE BUS...By the way, I disagree with those who have slagged the little boy in the movie, I thought he was great.  Very calm & collected, not a whiny little jerk like the kid in 'The Sixth Sense'  & others, called his mother 'Rachel' instead of 'Mom.'  But I'll admit when he told her 'You weren't supposed to help her,'  I thought 'Well okay, NOW you tell us.....'
Didn't much care for the dead-horse motif.   Leave the animals alone, y'all....",Null,0,0,19 October 2002
Monster," Dirty Pretty Depressing Things (possible minor spoilers)
","It always seems a little ironic when a brilliant movie is made about miserable little people doing bad things.  'In Cold Blood' is probably the best example.  Scott Wilson (who's also briefly in 'Monster') and Robert Blake were perfect as the guys who killed a Kansas family for about forty bucks but through no fault of their own, the technology and impact of cinema gave their characters a kind of elevated resonance that the real killers (probably) didn't have. If the executed killers could see the movie in some kind of afterlife, I wonder how they reacted to it or if they thought it should have been done at all.  I wonder the same about the executed Aileen Wuornos and 'Monster.'As the hapless harried prostitute who went down in history as 'America's first female serial killer,' an unrecognizable Charlize Theron assumes a completely alien physicality that rivals that of Robert de Niro in 'Raging Bull.'  But it would be unfair to credit the make-up department for her performance.  It's an absolutely fearless and ballsy job on her part; while of course any thespian playing a real person (especially with lots of 'warts') has a kind of background edge, in a way it's even more of a challenge to create an onscreen persona to whom audiences can 'relate' when the character is real as opposed to one created out of whole cloth, because there can't be any little 'twitches' that don't tally with what the audience members know (or think they know) about the real person.  So e.g. in 'Monster' we couldn't see Theron hugging a puppy or something because we can't imagine the late Wuornos ever having done that.Wuornos denied she was a 'serial killer' because in her view each of the 'johns' she killed did something to provoke it; in the movie the first john-victim is depicted as a misogynist psycho (an almost equally unrecognizable Lee Tergesen from TV's 'Oz')  who would have killed her if she hadn't killed him.  It's then suggested that the other killings had a somewhat premeditated aspect to them, although Wuornos is hardly depicted as being coldly methodical about it--quite the contrary.  I suppose Wuornos took the truth about it to the grave with her.There's a subplot about Wuornos' relationship with a conflicted young lesbian played by Christina Ricci; while I can't claim to know how 'true to life' it is, it's compelling enough onscreen. I've never been much of a Ricci fan but she can be effective in the right part, like this one; she's like Wynona Ryder with a kind of sinister undercurrent.  Most of the other cast members (all but a few played by unknown actors) aren't required to do much more than look the part.  Bruce Dern is a real treat as Wuornos' only friend, a Vietnam vet a step away from homelessness.  Why doesn't he get used more?The movie's overall tone reminds me somewhat of T. Malick's mid-Seventies epics 'Badlands' and 'Days of Heaven,' meditations on the dichotomy between 'evil' and the somewhat (anti-)heroic stature we attach to it on the one hand, and on the other hand the decidedly mundane and pedestrian aspects of the actual people who do the actual 'evil' things. 'Monster' is a true slice of ripe Americana filmed on location in Florida where Wuornos lived, killed and died.  It's a great little piece of work in quasi-documentary style (which doesn't mean 'looking crude' like that stupid 'Blair Witch' thing) and I hope lots of foreigners watch it since they'll see us Yanks at our best, our worst and in the middle.  Not a single character comes off as being representative of a 'Superpower' which I love because neither does any actual Yank I've ever met, including or especially yours truly.Awards, of course, don't affect a movie's inherent qualities but I'll admit I was happy Theron won the Golden Globe, partly so the movie would have wider distribution.  Even though Uma Thurman in 'Kill Bill' was the tour de force par excellence covering a vast emotional range, Theron had the 'Billy Bob Thornton' kind of role, staying rigidly within the character's emotional limits.  That, I think, is even more of an achievement.A few quibbles: I thought 'Monster' somewhat breezed past the judicial proceedings and the execution was only mentioned on a title card at the end, but of course that wasn't the thrust of the story.  I didn't think it was necessary to have Ricci's Norman-Rockwell-Nazi mother character use the word 'nigger' to hint at the lifestyle against which Ricci was rebelling. We had grasped that already.  If the movie is ABOUT racism or has it as a strong theme or subtext, then words like that are appropriate.  (Quentin Tarantino uses the word when he thinks it's needed, and when its not needed, he doesn't use it.) But just tossed in as a quick jolt seems a kind of cheat.
So what do we 'learn' from 'Monster'?  Maybe nothing we didn't already know, or maybe just to remind us to count our blessings because however each of us may find his or her life lacking or crappy, look around and there's bound to be someone even worse off...No offense to Floridians but it's my theory that Florida is actually Hell. The guy who buried his puppies alive was there, and the woman who shot her kids and herself only the kids didn't die and had to lie on the floor wounded for a week, and Elian Gonzalez was kidnapped by Federal storm troopers, and Ted Bundy finished up there, and other criminal types, and of course Wuornos, and the latest horror with the girl on videotape.  Plus of course there's Janet Reno, Jeb Bush & the Hanging Chads....",Null,0,0,7 February 2004
Underworld," Why No Female Werewolves?
","That question among others came to mind during long stretches of 'Underworld' when not much was happening and there was time to appreciate the dark gloomy visuals.  (I'm a sucker for these Euro-filmed neo-noirs like this one and 'Feardotcom,' et al.)  I liked how they established the contrast between the elite, effete vampires (although one of them, the only black vampire, sports a Cockney accent) and the lumpen-proletariat werewolves.  The vamps hold posh parties with fancy wine glasses and everyone dressed to the nines; the 'lycans' hang out in subway tunnels watching slash-matches a la WWF fans.  But they don't seem to have any women on hand.  How have they reproduced over the centuries, just by biting people?A movie can succeed in one of two ways: we take the premise seriously, or we don't.  At the outset of  'Underworld' it seems we're invited to take it seriously, partly due to the heroine's sonorous narration.  Then when Kate Beckinsale and her partner casually leap off the tall buildings, bounce off the sidewalk and go strolling into the subway after their targets, we're all set for a nice juicy nightmarish thrill ride. Next thing we know, everybody's pulling out automatic weapons, complete with endless extra ammo clips; everyone's blasting away at everyone else without hitting much of anything.  The 'civilians' scatter, the police never arrive and the combatants slip away.  We're asked to believe this sort of thing has been going on for decades and earlier for centuries before guns were invented. The attention of human society, apparently, has been largely elsewhere. One can imagine a local TV news broadcast:  'In our top story tonight, Hungary defeats Germany 3-2 in the World Cup semi-finals; in other news, another skirmish between vampires and werewolves results in delays for many evening commuters, stay tuned for details...'Don't get me wrong, I often found myself enjoying this movie on it's own terms, Romeo-and-Juliet-rehash and all, but the script kept butting in with details demanding I take them seriously, even if they made no sense. There's a certain young-rock-star-looking dude in whom all the night folks are interested; he's human but he has werewolf blood but they have to bite him but they want to preserve him so they can draw blood samples but they also want to kill him but they want to devise some new species, or something to that effect.  (It seems the full moon is still a factor, along with all the syringes etc.) There's palace intrigue amongst the vamps.  There are double- and triple-crosses involving both sides.  There's back-story and blurry flashbacks and subplots.  In some scenes it's difficult to discern who's trying to kill whom, and why.  Maybe some of this was deliberately meant to invoke the chaos of a wartime situation.  The script was co-written by one of the actors and by the director, who's also Ms Beckinsale's fiance; maybe there was too much going on to make it all coherent and cohesive. But unlike the recent and equally chaotic 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico,' at least there we knew we were watching a live-action cartoon.   'Underworld' looks and sounds like it's supposed to be 'Schindler's List.'Still and all 'Underworld' is worth a look for the acting, atmosphere, art direction/set decoration and flashes of morbid humor; just resist the temptation to take it as seriously as it evidently wants to be taken.  If there's a sequel, as the ending promises, I'll probably go watch it, especially if Ms Beckinsale is in it; I have the advantage of not having seen her before, so I have no reason not to buy her as Selene.  But she could use a co-star with some pizzazz.   Hey, I think James Marsters is free nowadays....Best line: the werewolf boss to his unruly brawling minions:  'Put some clothes on, please...'BTW I seem to recall from 'Interview with the Vampire' that a human child who becomes a vampire stays a child forever, yet Selene, who was 'turned' as a child, still managed to 'grow up.'  Who gets to write 'the rules' these days, anyway?  The 'godfather,' Bram Stoker, made most of it up himself....",Null,0,0,21 September 2003
Dawn of the Dead," Scores the hat trick
","I use an ice hockey term in deference to this latest of umpteen recent Canadian imports: 'hat trick' means scoring three goals; this movie avoids the three killer mistakes often made by horror flicks post-'Scream,' and let's hope it's a trend: (1) No jokes or self-deprecating references. (2) No attempt to 'explain things.'  (3) No lame attempt at a 'happy ending.'  This is just a straight-up gore-fest and delivers the goods.'Dawn of the Dead' was my least favorite of George Romero's legendary zombie trilogy (which probably puts me at odds with about 90% of his fans) so not only did I have no problems with seeing a remake, I was hoping this would be an improvement, which it largely is.  It borrows elements from the original 'Night of the Living Dead' and also 'Day of the Dead' and retains the original 'Dawn''s premise of taking place mostly at a shopping mall. Since the satire on American consumerism isn't a particularly novel idea any more, the remake wisely doesn't play it up, in fact omits the key plot element from the original of the roving biker gang and the climactic inside-the-mall battle against the zombies.  It also adds some new elements (see under 'Spoilers').Sarah Polley (Canada's answer to Uma Thurman?) finally outgrows waif status as a no-nonsense nurse working long hours underappreciated by the doctors (I'm sure nurses in the audience can dig that).  There's a conversation in the hospital about a patient who may or may not be an infected zombie, but we never see him, so we never know.  She goes home and just has time for the semi-obligatory steamy shower scene with her paramour before all hell breaks loose absolutely out of the blue.  (We're informed this takes place in Wisconsin, although I would have preferred Pennsylvania as a nod to Romero.) Her escape sequence is stunningly filmed, much of it through her cracked car window, and reminded me of scenes in Polanski's 'The Pianist' with the protagonist observing chaotic action from a strictly subjective viewpoint, making it seem as disconcerting to us as it must to her.  Eventually she meets a shotgun-wielding cop played by Ving Rhames who has yet to find the star-making vehicle he deserves. This probably won't be it either, since he's not required to do much except glower and shoot, but boy is he fun to watch.  The nurse and the cop stumble across some other survivors and as per the original, take refuge inside an abandoned mall.  From then on if it's blood and violence you crave, you definitely get your money's worth.******************  SPOILERS  ************************
In order to jack up the tension level among the non-zombies, the absent roving bikers are replaced by some gun-happy redneck mall security guards whose sheer bloody-minded-ness is the only element that seems a little forced. (I mean heck, I was once a security guard and so was my brother, and we're both pretty nice guys for the most part.)  The chief security guard, who at first rivals the fascistic army captain in  'Day of the Dead,' eventually changes his stripes completely and even becomes a noble self-sacrificer, but then 'battlefield conversions' are a movie tradition. There's a bizarre sequence where a vaguely lowlife character straps his pregnant girlfriend to a bed and waits for her to give birth even knowing she's 'undead'----hey, how's that for 'commitment'!  Unfortunately the director feels compelled to show us the zombie-baby---well, using the imagination's for sissies anyway, I guess.  The remake expands upon the original scene with the gun store by placing it in a building outside the mall so the owner can develop a long-distance friendship with the cop, even conducting a chess match by using signs.  The gun store owner also passes the time by sniping at the zombies milling about in the street, with the others encouraging him 'Hey, get Burt Reynolds' or 'Rosie O'Donnell.'  Too bad they didn't name any government officials, but then these are tense times in the entertainment field.  We even see a scheme by the mall dwellers to use a dog to convey food to the gun store owner, since they're confident that zombies only eat humans, not dogs.  Well, how do they know that?  For that matter, why don't zombies eat one another?  (Not 'afraid of germs,' are they?)   How come it takes them so long to get inside the mall?  Why would the entire military apparatus of the country just immediately disappear? (The original 'Dawn' handled that by suggesting that the zombie attack had been ongoing for a while.) When the armored truck reaches the marina, how do they know which is the right boat, since the owner's dead?  But then who really cares?  We're here for the thrills and jolts.  The ending's a slight disappointment: could have been an ass-kicker rivalling the close of 'Cannibal Holocaust' but it's intercut with the closing credits and left mysterious as to what happens;  gee whiz, are they angling for a sequel to the remake?  Aren't there any NEW zombie stories to tell?The actors all carry their load, especially Jake Weber from HBO's 'Mind of the Married Man,' which just for the record I wish hadn't been cancelled. Weber can convey a lot with a little and, being British, could play both the Kevin Costner and the Hugh Grant regular-guy roles.  Fun to see Tom Savini reprising the police-chief role from 'Night of the Living Dead' ----'Shoot 'm in the head and burn 'm' ---although I wish they'd used the classic exchange from that scene:'Are they pretty slow-moving, Chief?' 'Yeah, they're dead.... they're all messed up.'One minor quibble: I'm sure every modern mall must have at least one computer-oriented store, so it would have been a nice touch to see the characters go on-line trying to make contact with someone.  But to borrow a line from Alex Cox' 'Straight to Hell':  'Still, mustn't grumble....' I'm just glad they were able to get this made and released in theaters before (if a certain  incumbent office-holder gets re-elected) this country becomes a guilty-pleasure-shlock-banning theocracy altogether.....",Null,0,0,21 March 2004
Alexander," Oliver Stone has finally 'lost it...'
","Of course Mr. Stone can still sling a yarn, but previously one always felt one at least knew why he wanted to do the project in the first place; now he seems out of sorts, not really knowing what to do with himself. Clearly a lot of material had to be excluded for a palatable cinematic running time; maybe this would have been better as a mini-series on HBO or something. The movie's chief weakness for me is Irish 'heart-throb' Colin Farrell in the title role; apparently Stone sees Alexander as a kind of ancient Greek Hamlet, and if there's any quality that Farrell doesn't exude very well, it's self-doubt. Farrell seems confused as to whether Alexander is supposed to be gay or straight or 'bi' or whatever and is convincing in none of those capacities. (In the scenes with Rosario Dawson from 'The Rundown' I actually worried about his physical well-being.) Also, to be convincing as somebody who had to keep pushing endlessly for new worlds to conquer, there had to be just a touch of lunacy lurking. Maybe Jude Law could have carried it off or even Ewan McGregor. But it's always fun watching Angelina Jolie especially when she's playing with snakes and/or doing an exotic accent, and a lot of the visuals are gorgeous, especially the Babylon scenes. But it's definitely time for Anthony Hopkins to retire, I mean seriously; after 'The Human Stain' and now this, he needs to get knighted, settle down and write his tell-all autobiography...",Null,14,25,25 February 2005
We Were Soldiers," Ten years too late? (Spoilers--of your dinner!)
","By now there's quite a body of film work about Vietnam.  It's hard for a new one to avoid the 'Been there before' pitfall.  Also hard to avoid the political entanglement, although this one tries hard & nearly succeeds. To its great credit it begins with the French getting their butts kicked in the 1950s, we should remember this was not originally our war, we inherited it & strolled in there understanding basically nothing of the local situation, how Ho Chi Minh was a Nationalist more than a Communist & had lived in Brooklyn once & knew a lot about Americans. The first American soldier killed in then-Indochina was in 1945 (his attackers blew up his jeep, thinking he was French) & our involvement pre-dated Eisenhower & Kennedy, let alone LBJ whom we see on the black-&-white TV.  Mel Gibson's Colonel Moore is a wonderful character, a student of military & other history & a throwback to the era when officers actually were in front of their troops rather than far behind.  I haven't read the book but I imagine much of the character is from the real-life Moore, whom I saw on CNN recently & liked immediately.  The combination of religious fervor & military bloodlust with a dollop of wry humor is very real, I saw a lot of that in the army myself--these guys were scary & funny at the same time.  And they know when their superiors are being idiots yet they do what they're told the best they can, believing they have to answer to a Higher Authority if they shirk their duty.  I was glad that the battle scenes had a somewhat chaotic quality, a 'Now what the hell do we do?' aspect.  The best scenes were of the stranded platoon, guys thrown together in deep doodoo realizing they were just gonna have to come up with a way to survive, again I was reminded of guys I'd known in the army, maybe not the smartest or noblest guys in the world but made of some pretty stern stuff.   And there were certain scenes--here comes the SPOILER part--that people just need to see, like the guy who gets a white-phosphorus grenade ('Willie P,' we called that stuff) burning under his skin so the medic has to try to cut part of his face off with a bayonet, or the guy with half his face burned off by napalm & when someone takes hold of his legs to try to carry him, the fried skin slides right off.  This has special resonance in the wake of the September 11 horrorshow, remember those burn victims?  Or when the helicopter gunship cuts loose---yeah, people get turned into Swiss cheese, that's kinda the point.  (The military really only has 2 functions: to kill people & break things.)   That's how it is people. We send our young men off to do these horrible things for us, the least we can do is look at it occasionally.  Now cinematically, sure the flick has its flaws, e.g. that whole extended telegram sequence was flat & ungainly & had nothing like the unbearable tension of just one telegram scene in 'A League of Their Own,'  & the racial element seemed forced, the young black wife seemed an anachronism with her modern-day 'Word-up' 'tude.  The Galloway character added nothing in particular, although we know he was there & Barry Pepper's performance is fine, could've been saltier though. But I hope this flick finds an audience, especially currently, as our body count in Afghanistan mounts, we need to remind ourselves war's not just a sound-bite on TV, it's very real & very nasty & death is very permanent & especially when I hear talk like 'Let's go take out Saddam Hussein, it'll be a cakewalk,' all I can do is groan--well, that's another topic.   But bottom line, see the movie--it tells the truth.",Null,0,1,4 March 2002
Blade II," The sadness of vampirism
","The great English writer Graham Greene used to be a film critic back in the 1930s, & in one of his reviews he described how in a certain movie an actor had captured 'not just corruption but the sadness of corruption, a mind in chains...'  Sadness seems to be G. del Toro's forte.  His 'Cronos' had a haunting elegiac quality that has stuck with me for years, something ancient and mournful and beautiful like his native Mexico itself, & his American debut 'Mimic' had a similar quality, enhanced of course by the lustrous Mira Sorvino.  Yet 'Mimic' also had enough horrorshow bells-&-whistles to keep the Yank audiences entranced--even Siskel & Ebert raved about it, they recognized the primal level it tapped.Ultimately what's the most horrifying thing about vampirism?  Isn't it that you're neither one thing nor the other?  You're human-but-not, alive-but-not, doomed to an eternity of consciousness with nothing more to achieve but the next hemaglobin fix.  You know you're a monster, a freak of nature, but there's nothing else for you to be.  So you make the most of that.  The seminal 'Near Dark' pioneered the vampire-as-badass-antihero concept.  TV's 'Buffy' & 'Angel' rendered it cartoonish.  Del Toro has reinvigorated it.The first 'Blade' deserves credit for some bold notions: vampirism as a virus; a 'caste system' of 'purebloods' as opposed to 'mixed blood' or those who were merely 'turned' --the most memorable line from 'Blade' was Udo Kier's 'I was born a vampire, as was every member of this council'--it'd never occurred to me before that that one could be a vampire from conception onward, I mean imagine the vampire parents 'He's a little cranky, he's been fanging'---the re-introduction of silver & garlic as anti-vampire tools; the 'corporate' aspect.  Yet the original suffered from twin limitations: it never ventured beyond the comic-book realm, & it's bad-guys were terminally lame, chiefly Stephen Dorff.  He was okay in 'City of Industry' as a cocky punk.  He was okay in some other movie in a similar role.  But a vampire??? Threatening the entire world, yet???   Gimme a break.
But with 'Blade II' we're in the realm of the sad & the ancient.  Not just because it's filmed in a history-soaked European city--it's the desperation & black-humor at play.  The opening blood-bank scene sets the tone perfectly. I won't give it away, although it's probably no secret by now. But it alerts us we're in for something different.  A dark corner of the soul is about to be explored.  After that one may opt to stick around for the ride, or not.  Sure there's the computerized stuff that everyone has noted, & other aspects.  But beneath the audience-grabbing bells & whistles, this is a movie about sadness, & desperation, & despair.  The recently late Billy Wilder said 'If you want to say something important, wrap it in chocolate'--or in this case, If you want to say something bleak, wrap it in SFX.I've been deliberately avoiding specifix.  Others have said 'This is great,' 'This sucks,' 'This looks like Nosferatu' or 'The Matrix' etc.  I myself thought the movie's vampire-boss looked a little too much like Mark Metcalf as the Master in 'Buffy' a few years back.  And a few other quibbles. (Del Toro borrows chiefly from himself, too bad we don't have 'auteurs' any more.)  But bottom line, this flick REALLY got under my skin.  I'd never figured I'd cry at the end of a vampire flick, but damn, there's even some emotional resonance there.  Again, the inescapable sadness.  I think that's the true genius of the whole vampire shtick, whether it's from Bram Stoker or elsewhere--not seeing the sun.  If there's anything more beautiful on this planet than a sunset, it's a sunrise.  I was out for a walk before dawn one morning recently & passed a little pond with some ducks on the surface, still largely in silhouette with the sun venturing up from behind the trees; I'd like to retain that image until I die.But don't get me wrong, this is still a 'popcorn flick,' it would never be nominated for an oscar (thank god) but if you see it, it'll stick.  You may even want to see it again.  I probably will.  Filmmakers are the modern alchemists.  Mr. Del Toro, from our ancient, sad & beautiful southern neighbor, has much to show us.  I say it's a ride worth taking.  There's always the bright new safe amusement park next door.PS If Wesley Snipes wants to make this a franchise character, it's okay with me, maybe he'll make enough to where he'll be game for another 'arty' little project like 'The Water Dance...'  Meanwhile---YOU GO, BOY!",Null,1,3,28 March 2002
The Bourne Identity," ... but what happened to the blonde chick?
","I went into this one expecting some solid mindless mayhem, good 'popcorn flick.'  (I use quotes 'cause I don't usually eat popcorn at movies since I go to matinees right after having lunch.)  Got that, & then some. Cinematically so far this is my biggest pleasant surprise of the year. Really holds together well.  GRANTED, one needs to accept the premise, particularly the amnesia bit; just out of curiosity, has anyone in history ever actually had amnesia? (Just 'cause there's a word for something doesn't mean it exists; I've never seen a 'unicorn,' for instance.)  It would've been great if someone in the movie, preferably Franka, had said 'Amnesia? Don't only people on soap operas have that?'Well, now that I've mentioned Franka: guess it's chiefly due to her that this one works so well for me.  This is a genuine FOX.  Got an immediate crush on her in 'Run Lola Run,' & thought 'Well it's too bad she can't have an English-speaking film career since she doesn't resemble Sarah Michelle goddamned Geller or some such.'  But look at those eyes, dammit.   Pair her up with a leading man even somewhat bearable, & bingo.  Matt Damon is one of the few young leading men these days about whom the word 'likable' pops up. Hard to say why he's likable.  'I don't know about art, but I know what I like...'  There's a kind of grace to him onscreen, an anti-in-your-face quality, it's as though he's embarrassed to get caught getting depicted. (By way of contrast, I wish his buddy Ben Affleck would just go away. Affleck's like a goyisher Adam Sandler, who knows he's annoying & makes it work for him.  Affleck doesn't seem to know he's annoying, which makes it even more annoying.)  This reluctant-hero persona can be absolute gold in the action realm; Steve McQueen comes to mind.  In this movie Damon & Potente together have charisma out the wazoo.  Comes out in quiet little moments; they're in a car together, or a diner, one will glance at the other, whatever.  The scene in his apartment: the two of them generate all the tension; don't believe me?  Imagine the shooting script: 'She comes out of the bathroom, he picks up a knife, he puts it down, she looks around, he looks around, she smiles, he frowns,' etc.  The actors make it work. Franka even overcomes the flick's chief plot flaw: once he's had his ride to Paris & she's been paid, there's really no reason at all for them to be together any more.  She makes us believe her character knows she should split but just doesn't want to.Oh, & supporting cast?  Chris Cooper?  Brian Cox?  I think I'd pay to see Cooper read the phone book; that guy owns the screen when he's on it.  His face is like the proverbial car wreck: you can't not watch it, whether you want to or not.  His 3-minute part in 'Money Train' is acid-etched into my brain for life. Cox?  Sorry Anthony Hopkins but Cox's Hannibel Lecter was far superior, every supporting part he plays is a treasure for me.  ...Plus all those great Europeans; I even got caught up in the card game on the boat at the beginning.  They exude Presence or something.  Even the pain-in-the-ass African character was fascinating, if for no other reason than how shamefully that continent gets ignored usually.  (Less than a decade ago there was genocide occurring there to make Bosnia look like burlesque.  In the media it was a sideshow.  'If the corpses are black, the world stands back.')  EVERY part in this movie seemed to resonate; the exasperated English friend, the bespectacled sniper, the blonde chick--each seemed a real entity.But of course it's an Action flick & as such more than passes muster. Sure, there were some random musings here & there, e.g. 'An American guy with amnesia on a French boat arrives in port, why doesn't he IMMEDIATELY seek the nearest Yank embassy?' or 'Cops are chasing a car--shouldn't they be radio-ing for more cops so that the chasee can't escape merely by shaking those few off?' or 'All those Marines in the embassy--they weren't allowed to poke their heads out the door?' or 'Not since Bruce Lee flicks have body blows sounded this loud.'  But what chiefly gave me pause--enough to make it the title of this piece--is the scene towards the end--this isn't a 'spoiler,' doesn't really affect the action one way or the other--Damon & Cooper & the blonde chick are in a room having the big showdown.   She's seen constantly, up to a certain point--then she's just not seen any more. We don't see something happen to her in the room; we don't see her leave the room; I think we never see her again.  She had had enough screen time that we're led to believe she's at least somewhat significant to the proceedings--certainly we see what happens to certain characters with much less screen time--but she just kinda evaporates.  So what the hell happened to her?  I even checked under 'Goofs' before beginning this piece, thinking maybe it was just a continuity problem. But bottom line: see the movie, it's fun.  I may even want to see it again, before I groaningly drag my butt off to see 'Minority Report' with Spielberg apparently having decided he wants to be Stanley Kubrick the rest of his life.  (I'm not sure even Kubrick wanted to be Kubrick.)",Null,0,1,29 June 2002
The Hills Have Eyes," Better than the original (for once).....
","My problem with Alexandre Aja's previous 'High Tension' was the failure to acknowledge his source material (Dean Koontz' novel 'Intensity') plus he abandoned Koontz' story and tacked on a ludicrous 'twist ending.' But when I heard he'd be doing the remake of Wes Craven's 'Hills Have Eyes' I was happy because Mr. Aja clearly has a gift for ---umm----intensity on screen. My anticipation has been rewarded: Mr. Aja has done with Craven's movie what the Cramps used to do with those goofy old 'novelty tunes' like 'Rockin' Bones,' 'Googoo Muck' and 'Green Door': stripped it down to it's essentials, amplified those and poured his soul into it as though this were indeed his own original work. He's also made some improvements, chiefly the 'backstory' about nuclear testing in the Southwest and a remarkable sequence not in the original (granted, it reminds one of the recent 'House of Wax' remake) with a guy wandering through a 'ghost town' populated mostly by mannequins. Aja let 'r rip with the make-up effects (clearly this was money Craven lacked at the time; about all he could do was hire the diseased Michael Berryman for effect) to make these people REALLY mutant (granted, it reminds one of the inbred hillbillies in 'Wrong Turn'). He also gave them all the same proficiency in English. Unfortunately he lets one of the desert rats make a rambling speech about the ill effects of the nuclear testing; that point was already made during the opening credits.The plot outline is remarkably faithful to that of the original (a 'normal' family on a camping trip to California runs afoul of loonies in the boonies); Aja seems to agree with me that 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' This means that if one's seen the original, one pretty much knows what's coming throughout, not necessarily a bad thing. Even Aja's minor changes are an improvement, e.g. we don't see Ruby right away at the gas station; the gas station owner is more sinister and absorbing, deliberately sending the family into harm's way to cover up his own involvement with the crazies but then atoning for his sins in a suitably violent manner; when one crazy snacks on a pet bird, instead of stuffing it all into his mouth he bites off the head then drinks the blood. Aja makes the family more likable than did Craven (still not people whose company I'd seek), thus it's easier to give a crap what happens to them, plus he doesn't try to give the crazies 'equal time,' leaving them their more effective function as the menacing Other(s). And if you came for blood, you won't be disappointed. I read that this version was edited for the R rating, but there's still plenty here in which to wallow. For those worried that Aja would try to 'up the ante' by letting the baby die: relax: as I'd expected, he knows what Yanks will and will not accept. Hitchcock killed a kid in a movie in 1936 and got grief about it the rest of his life.All the actors give Aja what he needs---for those guys buried under the make-up: you're real troopers! Personal favorite Ted Levine made the best impression on me as the retired cop; Aja doesn't let him use the 'N-word' but does give him a snide line about Democrats hating guns (yet it's the 'peacenik' son-in-law who manages to hit his target). Kathleen Quinlan lends her small role enough subtlety and underlying pathos to warrant an Oscar nomination in a different sort of movie. Emilie de Ravin from TV's 'Lost' isn't required to do much more than scream and does that well, plus gets a nice lick in at the end. Kudos to large-eyed Laura Ortiz as Ruby who with barely any dialog conveys the sadness of the only desert rat to want to escape their little hellhole; Aja gives her a final action that comes darn close to elevating this particular gore fest to 'tragedy' status.Have to get this quibble in: is there anybody in the universe unaware that when you've been battling a homicidal maniac and he's finally down, you NEVER EVER just assume he's dead? Even if the character never saw a horror flick in his life, having gone through all that to rescue his baby, he's got a shotgun and he's not going to empty it into the body? In this instance Craven's version was better with the son-in-law repeatedly plunging the knife into the bastard's chest, exactly what I would've done. As Ice-T eloquently put it in 'Trespass': 'It's about survival..' I didn't mind the closing bit with the binoculars---seemed a final visual jolt as in 'High Tension'---just so there's NO SEQUEL---- enough already. .'And the Academy Award for Spookiest Impersonation of an American Desert goes to----MOROCCO, for 'The Hills Have Eyes'!

Jarhead," The real tragedy of the military is the waste of all that young testosterone....
","...Whew, lengthy summary there, but that about sums up my gut reaction to this film. There's a lot in 'Jarhead' that may seem mysterious to someone who was never a young male who signed up for one of the branches of armed service, especially with the expectation of going to war shortly. The bulk of this movie takes place between the summer 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq and the following spring when our massed forces simply rolled over the Iraqi trenches, burying thousands of them alive (this rightly isn't depicted in 'Jarhead,' since it wasn't witnessed by the guy who wrote the book on which the movie is based) before stopping short from ousting Saddam Hussein because Bush Senior and his crew (including Dick Cheney) correctly believed that it would lead to chaos and a Vietnam-like morass for us. (This of course didn't stop Bush Junior and his crew (including Dick Cheney) from getting us into exactly that situation twelve years later, but that's been dealt with before....) In a nutshell, 'Jarhead' depicts all these young gungho Marines going nuts because they're not permitted to do their job, i.e. engage and destroy the enemy through fire and maneuver, or more bluntly: kill people and break things. An 'ordinary person' may think 'So what's the problem? They're alive and well,' etc. To the extent 'Jarhead' has a flaw, it's that it simply relies on the realities about which the real Mr. Swofford wrote. If the viewer doesn't 'buy into' that, then the movie won't succeed for him/her.One of the many things I liked about 'Jarhead' is that it's NOT about politics, at all. When one Marine character tries to bring that up ('We're here fighting for the oil companies,' etc.) another character cuts that short: 'We're here now. Everything else is bull---t.' Both are correct. The character whose line that is, played by the intelligence-exuding Peter Sarsgaard, is if anything the most intelligent of the group, also the most cynical and the most gungho; in a cruel twist of fate, he's the only one of them other than the sergeant who wants to be a Marine for life, but they won't let him stay because he lied about having a criminal record.If director Sam Mendes has succeeded at his task, then by the time you get to what I regard as the climax, with the two snipers finally ready to consummate their mission by shooting the Iraqi officer in the tower, you'll fully understand and embrace their reaction when that gets taken away from them. If your reaction is similar to that of the asshole Major, then I guess Mendes has failed, and maybe should have just presented it as a straight documentary.Some random plug points: Sarsgaard stands out in an exemplary cast; his part is not so large as to preclude a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for him. The photography admirably transforms southern California and Mexico into Kuwait and Iraq, aided of course by the inevitable computer graphics. The scene with the Marines encountering the ghost convoy with the burned and blackened corpses is suitably eerie, although I wish movies would quit showing people vomiting on-screen because they can't get the projectile nature of it right; it looks like people spitting something out, not something being forced out. (Whenever I've had to throw up, I felt like the poor sap in 'Alien,' only not through the chest of course.) Nice to see a war movie occasionally acknowledge 'friendly fire,' such as that which took the life of former NFL star Pat Tillman. Near the end I liked the line 'We won't have to come back here...' letting the sad irony just briefly resonate. The scene with the jar heads getting engrossed in 'Apocalypse Now' was just brilliant (at Fort Benning I knew a guy who had the dialog from that one memorized). Minor quibble: the scene with Swofford threatening the other Marine at gunpoint in the tent was the only one that felt somewhat 'staged,' where Jake Gyllenhaal seemed to be 'acting.' Like Matthew Modine in 'Full Metal Jacket,' he has to carry the movie playing a character who seems not always believable even though (or maybe because) it's based on a real person. Somehow Mr. Gyllenhall's Swofford is always either too much of a 'wise guy' or not enough of one.... That brings me to my semi-final point: yeah, I know 'Jarhead' reminds people of other movies, especially 'Full Metal Jacket,' especially early on. That couldn't have been avoided anyway, but it fits with the motif of these young guys living in the shadow of Vietnam. ('That's Vietnam music,' Gyllenhaal laments at one point, 'can't we have our own music?') If anything I credit Mendes with making the Vietnam analogy less overbearing than I probably would have done myself. (The government did learn one thing from 'Nam though, nowadays they don't let us actually see our dead or wounded if they can prevent it.) One final quibble: 'Jarhead' makes no reference to 'Gulf War Syndrome' which (unsurprisingly) the Veterans Administration has been trying to downplay as much as possible, but maybe that wasn't in Mr. Swofford's book which I confess I haven't read.I have an unhappy hunch that 'Jarhead' may suffer the same fate as 'Blackhawk Down,' another painfully meticulous rendition of an episode in our military history that we just seem to want to forget. But those two will, I believe, be in the pantheon of (anti)war movies some day, along with 'Paths of Glory' and 'A Midnight Clear' and a few others. Maybe the best scene in 'Jarhead' is with the graying Vietnam veteran on the bus with the young studs staring at him politely but quizzically. 'All wars are different; all wars are the same,' kids shooting their youthful vim/vigor wad at the behest of the 'stupid white men'....",Null,1,3,5 November 2005
The Pianist," Polanski's Triumph
","Before this movie, the top two that I'd seen about World War II and specifically the Holocaust were Lina Wertmueller's 'Seven Beauties' and the original 'Jacob the Liar' from the former East Germany.  (I haven't seen 'Schindler's List.')  Now there's a third.  'Pianist' shares some traits with the others.  One is that the German characters are not purely evil, although they do many evil things.  Another is that the non-German characters are not purely saintly.  (In 'Jacob,' the least sentimental and in my view the best of the three, there's a scene with some young kids being brats, as young kids often are in real life.  This makes their impending death that much more compelling, knowing they'll never get the chance to grow out of their brattiness.)  In addition, all three films focus on guys who are not soldiers or war heroes, in fact the protagonist of 'Beauties' was a Mafioso.  They're just trying to survive, even in a world that's gone nuts, because ultimately, that's all there is: the next breath, and then the one after it.The title character of the pianist has a comfortable life in prewar Warsaw and is so devoted to his musical career that when bombs start going off outside his recording studio, he's reluctant to quit playing.  We meet his family in their tastefully furnished home and see that they have as yet a dim notion of the realities of war, as they contemplate what to pack on the way to becoming refugees.  (One suspects Roman Polanski drew on his own background as well as that of the book by the real-life pianist.)  When they hear on the radio that Britain and France have declared war, they decide to stay put, naively assuming the foreign cavalry will come riding to the rescue.The brilliance of the early part of the film is the gradualness of the hardships imposed upon this family.  First it's one thing and then another, over a period of time.  This lets us see how it's human nature to keep adjusting to new and deteriorating conditions, always hoping things will improve or at least not get any worse.  An example is when they learn they will have to wear Jewish armbands in public.  A few protest they won't do it.  Later we see the father out in public with his armband.  Later still, they all have one. It never gets referred to again.  It just becomes another unpleasant fact of life.  So by the time all the Jews in the city are ordered into a walled-off section, we see how they've been 'eased into' it; had the Nazis decreed a ghetto from day one, that probably would've spurred an uprising.Once in the ghetto, we see what anthropologists call a 'behavioral sink' developing.  I found this the hardest part of the movie to take, even more so than the later battles and carnage.  It's not pleasant to watch kids dying in the street as adults walk past them, or to see a starving old man grab a bowl of gruel away from a starving old woman, then eat the spilled gruel off the street.  But these are realities that we don't usually get to see, even on CNN these days.  I don't know if Polanski has been accused of 'anti-Semitism' but if he has been, it's probably due to these ghetto scenes, with some of the Jews living luxuriously (one guy in a cafe even orders the pianist to stop playing while he counts his money) while others starve, and some Jews working as police for the Nazis, and one character blaming their plight on American Jewish bankers not doing enough to get America into the war, etc.  But Polanski's point is that the Warsaw ghetto was a microcosm of human society in extreme conditions.  Sure they were oppressed because they were Jews but they suffered because they were human beings.  Polanski underlines this with a scene of a guy reading the famous Shylock speech in 'The Merchant of Venice.'  Fortunately such editorializing is kept to a minimum.By the time the Jews are rounded up to be put on board the cattle car trains, they're so beaten down we see why they don't rise up and storm the guards (as one character suggests).  It would be pointless anyway, and there's still that next breath to take, and the next one. At the last minute the pianist gets yanked out of line by a semi-friendly Jewish cop; his family members get shoved into the train and he never sees them again, there's no time for tearful farewells.  For the remainder of the movie we see the pianist mostly hiding out.The brilliance in this part is how rigidly Polanski sticks to the protagonist's point of view.  Whatever horrible things are occurring, we only see what he sees.  Some may be disappointed we don't see more of the armed uprising in the ghetto, for instance, which the pianist watches through the window of the hidden apartment he's occupying.  But it's crucial that this remain HIS story.  As we watch people getting killed at a distance, we even feel some relief we're not closer to it, which is how he must have felt.  Guilt, maybe, but definitely relief too.  There's still the next breath, and the one after that.
POSSIBLE SPOILERS FROM HERE ONWARDS
The narrative became a little disjointed in the movie's latter part; it wasn't always clear when things were occurring, or why, or who were all these various people in the pianist's life, but probably that was also deliberate, illustrating his state of mind as he became ever more detached from the events unfolding around him.  The pianist focusses on the essentials: food, and breathing.  His existence becomes almost purely reactive: if there's food, eat it; if there's danger, flee from it. Only the memory of his music reminds him of his personhood.  In a scene where he's secreted with a piano and advised to remain silent, I actually thought for a moment he was going to play it, but of course, the survival instict wins out.  Instead he plays a kind of 'air piano.'Eventually the war comes right into his face in the form of a tank; there's great use of sound after a shell tears through a wall near him, I could actually feel my ears ringing.  He's back in the street, seemingly the only living person in an endless cityscape of blasted buildings.  In an abandoned hospital he finds a can of vegetables which he carries religiously for most of the rest of the movie.  Finally he finds an empty house that even has a piano in it---and lo and behold, a German officer regarding him quizzically. This was also a real-life character who helped the pianist survive.  In the movie it's not clear why, although we see a photo of the officer's family on his desk and he refers to God at one point; the actor is very good and subtle and I had no problem accepting what was occurring, but this was the only part of the movie with elements that reminded me of other movies, such as the 'good' German in 'The Keep,' or the scene in Ralph Bakshi's animated 'American Pop' with the American playing piano for the dying German.  (I half expected the pianist in this movie to play 'Lilli Marlene' or something for the officer.)  Another minor problem is that the introduction of this 'good German' at the end draws our focus away from the pianist.  We start wondering what happened to the German after the war, and there are some onscreen words to tell us.  But I think it would have been better if the German had just come and gone, like everyone else over the course of the film.  It should have been another 'brick in the wall' of the pianist's story of survival.Many individual scenes stick in the memory; if I had to single one out, it would be when a German officer randomly pulls guys out of a group, has them lie down and then calmly walks along shooting each one in the head.  When he gets to the last guy, he has to reload.  While watching the doomed guy's face in his last few seconds I thought 'What the hell would I be thinking in his place?  Would I try a last desperate lunge, or just wait for the inevitable?'Adrien Brody has to carry the movie and does an admirable job, especially in the early scenes when he has to grapple with an increasingly untenable situation.  Later on, the physicality of the role takes over somewhat, as he becomes gaunt, shaggy, shivering and dazed.  But at the end when he's back to a 'normal' postwar life (or is it?) there's a residual sadness in his face as he plays.  Fine acting all around (the woman seeking her missing husband was just a little on the hokey side) but I wish a decision had been made about the accents, viz. 'Okay, in this movie English is actually Polish but we're going to use English accents.'   Fastidiously realistic sets and locations.  The black and white footage at the beginning included a statue then seen periodically throughout,  a nice anchoring touch.
Definitely not a popcorn flick, no emotional surge at the end a la 'Saving Private Ryan.'  Should it matter to anyone that Mr. Szpilman survived the war and lived to a ripe old age?  (Would it matter if any one of us did?) One may even wonder what the point of it all was .... a question worth pondering as we seem to be on the way to another war ....'Szpilman' means 'player,' for those wondering about the German officer's remark that it's a good name for a pianist.",Null,1,1,9 February 2003
The Transporter," Nobody Smokes Cigarettes Like the French
","For me Francois Berleand was the star of this movie as the worldlywise French cop who knows exactly who the Transporter is and what he does, but he approaches his job like a chess game where he's always a few moves ahead of his opponent.  Like the great Jean Gabin in those wonderful old black and white flicks, Berleand speaks volumes with a shrug, a glance,  a half smile or (of course) a puff of the de rigueur cigarette, without which it's impossible to be properly Gallic and suave.  Mr. Statham, for his part, seemed most engaged in the proceedings during his verbal rope-a-dope with Mr. Berleand.I have liked Mr. Statham a lot not just in those English gangster movies but in 'The One' with Jet Li and John Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars,' he deserves to be a star in his own right and this movie co-starring a vehicle should have been the right vehicle for him.  It's a shame he was given so little to do, aside from kicking the crap out of many people, which he does quite handily.  There's a lot of talk about 'rules' in this movie and the movie itself obeys the rules of martial arts onscreen, one being that when the hero is facing a bunch of bad guys, they're only allowed to attack him one or two at a time, and they're not allowed to have guns unless they stand so close that the hero can disarm them.  Jacie Chan's classic shtick of picking up any handy item to use as a weapon is alive and well here, likewise Chan's trademark element of farce/slapstick, e.g. the oil-slick brouhaha.  And we have death-defying stunts galore and tire-squealing car chases and all sorts of goings -on.     Yet somehow Mr. Statham himself seems to get lost in the proceedings.It's really not his fault.  His character is very sketchily written, the plot seems to have been made up as they went along a la 'Casablanca,'  and the desired chemistry between him and the Chinese heroine just doesn't happen.  I don't know who the actress is or what she did previously, and she's, you know, cute and all that, but she just did nothing for me whatsoever, and apparently not much for Mr. Statham either.  She's no Bai Ling, let's say, much less a Lucy Liu or Kelly Hu or--dare I mention the name--Michelle Yeoh aka Michelle Kwan.  She's a cypher and even the writers seem to have grasped that; look how long they keep her bound and gagged onscreen to try to generate some fetishistic interest in what's happening with her.  'The Big Hit,' another movie with a kidnapped Chinese chick falling for the kidnapper, only took about five minutes to generate the romantic oomph that his one never really achieves.  The movie doesn't even bother including the usually obligatory closing shot of the of the hero & heroine alone together, as though acknowledging they were never really an item.As we knew in advance from the trailer, there's a scene where the bad guys approach Statham's house to kill him and choose to deviate from the French tradition of subtlety by firing a rocket launcher at the place.  The scene goes on so long it becomes funny, but stupid-funny not clever-funny.  One would think the bad guys at least would have made sure Statham was even home before unleashing more firepower than, I think, the French army used at Dienbenphu.  They seemed to know in advance they would be undisturbed by the arrival of police during their assault; maybe they'd read the script, assuming there was one.  But it did afford the French cop one of the best lines in the movie, when he drily asked if Statham would care to account for the thousands of rounds of spent ammo surrounding the remains of his house. 'Maybe they had the wrong house....'   Good one, Centurion!Bottom line, I did enjoy this but not as much as I was hoping I would.  If they do a sequel, maybe Mr. Besson himself will take charge next time & give us another cult classic like 'La Femme Nikita' or 'The Professional' ....",Null,0,0,16 October 2002
28 Days Later...," Panic in Year 2003
","In 1962 Ray Milland directed himself in a taut little B-movie thriller called 'Panic in Year Zero' which in it's own unpretentious way examined the theme of 'We're on our own so now what the hell do we do' more compellingly than other flicks with much bigger budgets.  A key moment was when the Milland character heard someone say that there was no more law so they could do what they wanted; he sharply responded 'The law will come back.  We just have to survive until it does.'  I don't know if Danny Boyle has seen this movie but I see a lot of it in '28 Days Later,' especially the underlying faith of the characters that (A) there will always be some form of government and (B) this is a good thing.  I also see this very much as a movie by and about British people, so it's interesting to read how many viewers on this site discern in it lessons for America.I've only seen two of Mr. Boyle's previous films, 'Trainspotting' and 'A Life Less Ordinary,' and parts of a third, 'The Beach,' on TV.  He's always got his tongue at least somewhat in his cheek, and he doesn't mind mixing the funny with the horrible, letting audience members react as they will. John Cleese once remarked to Dick Cavett that Americans would benefit if they could learn the European knack of holding conflicting views simultaneously.  Mr. Boyle also seems to be teaching this lesson.  At times he seems to be daring us to break out of our standard cinematic emotional responses.  But when he wants to, he can capture a moment of genuine pathos and present it as deftly as anyone working today.  An example in '28 Days Later' is when the hero looks at the photo left behind by his dead parents and reads what's written on the back of it.Mr. Boyle seems keen on asking WHY humans do what they do.  He would seem to agree with Thomas Carlyle's observation about the average man that 'Mere use-and-wont leads him everywhere by the nose, and prejudice, which he pretends to despise, is his absolute lawgiver.'  In each movie he'll put his characters in some bizarre milieu, whether it's sub-Third-World conditions of Scottish heroin addiction in 'Trainspotting,' or people hounded by murderous angels in 'A Life Less Ordinary,' or an island run by a fascistic drug cult in 'The Beach,' or a depopulated England beset with diseased maniacs in '28 Days Later.'  Each of these is basically a backdrop against which Mr. Boyle examines human habits and tendencies.  '28' zeroes in on the English specifically with their 'insular' mentality.  Maybe Mr. Boyle was inspired by the 'mad cow disease' scare over there, and he seems to be poking fun at the country's obsession with keeping rabies at bay.  The mysterious disease in the movie resembles rabies in some respects.  We hear characters speculating what's happening in the rest of the world---'Everywhere else people are still watching television.  What should they do with a sick little island?  Quarantine it, that's what.'  Living on a tiny island that once dominated much of the world, the English have always had a kind of love/hate relationship with that world.  Most recently it's heard in debate about the 'Euro' currency.  Mr. Boyle also spoofs the English preoccupation with social delicacies, as when the army officer tells his guests/captives 'Look, I promised them women, you see.'  Then he shows us the two female characters dressed to the nines sitting on a couch in front of a portrait of the grand dame of the house in days of yore, also dressed to the nines.Anyone who started reading this wondering what I think of the movie's visceral aspects has probably left already, so now I'll address the visceral aspects: a lot of it's well done, although some scenes feel rushed.  The spookiest scene is probably the one in the tunnel with the flat tire and the rats and the approaching shadows on the wall, even though the screenwriter had to bend over backwards to put the characters there.  Much of the action is dark and/or chaotically edited, hard to tell who's doing what to whom, but that seems to be the style nowadays so I'll just have to live with it. (We've all had scary dreams, right?  Think of one you've had, say with someone or something coming after you: did it have eye-blink editing? Wasn't it just an unbroken, inescapable view of the menace?  That's what made it scary, right?  Why can't movies do that?)  By the way everyone refers to the sick people as 'zombies,' but as I recall, they weren't the re-animated dead, they were just very sick live people.  A disease communicated mostly by blood or saliva ought to have been relatively easy to contain, I would have thought, as opposed to one that's airborne or carried by bugs of some kind.  My mom, who saw it with  me, pointed out that it would have been scarier if the disease hadn't manifested itself immediately after infection but rather taken a while, so someone could seem healthy then eventually deteriorate.  Since the countryside seemed relatively free of the sick, what was so urgent about getting to Manchester?  That recorded broadcast seemed a pretty obvious setup, along with various plot contrivances pointed out by others.  Still, I'm cutting it a lot of slack just 'cause I couldn't predict every plot point an hour ahead of time, and based on Mr. Boyle's track record in that regard I'll happily pay to see his next offering in the cinema so long as it doesn't have Leo Di Caprio in it.At the outset, with the Animal Liberation Front types raiding the research lab, I was hoping that whole disgusting can of worms would get examined in a relatively major movie, but unfortunately it was just a set-up sequence; the chimps are never seen again.  I guess it's just a given today that animal abuse is okay if we're allegedly trying to cure something; never mind that the chief goal of this industry, like any industry, is self-perpetuation. It's too bad Mr. Boyle didn't use the original ending mentioned in IMDB, with the human discussing procreation with the chicken, to tie in with the animal theme.  Guess he too has to worry about audience unhappiness with unhappy endings. To borrow a line from Pink Floyd's 'The Final Cut':  Mr. Boyle, 'Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow....'

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Money well spent
","The crucial question about Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy seems to be: Is it just for Tolkien fans, or a 'general audience'? I went to see it with my mom who's never read Tolkien; she liked Part I last year and liked Part II even more, but then she has her own cinematic agenda (based largely on sets & costumes, plus she loves horses).  As for the story, it was basically 'good vs. evil' again; she noted that it's easy to tell one from another: the bad guys are hideously ugly, & the good guys aren't.I read the trilogy over 20 years ago and confess I don't remember most of the middle book, so if Jackson made lots of changes, he could have fooled me.  I remembered certain plot details from Ralph Bakshi's animated 1978 version.  So I knew in advance more or less how Jackson's 'Two Towers' would begin and end, the rest was up for grabs.  By and large it didn't grab me, but talk about money well spent! The physical authenticity from last year's movie is, if anything, exceeded here, and as for SFX, the Gollum character alone deserves an Oscar.  Can a computer-generated character be said to steal a movie?  It's almost too good; I couldn't take my eyes off Gollum, even when he was off in the corner of the screen; I forgot the various heroic events occurring elsewhere.  Inasmuch as I already know how the story ends, the warped 'humanity' of Gollum afforded a poignancy to what I know will occur that I never would have anticipated.  If there's a 'tragic figure' in this tale, Gollum's it, whether it be 'Greek' tragedy---'What a shame it had to be this way' -- or 'Christian' tragedy  --'What a shame it was this way when it could have been some other way.'But for the most part I found this movie curiously uninvolving in an emotional sense.  There's nothing here remotely as gripping as the death of Boromir in Part I, which made me cry each of the three times I saw it in the cinema.  Part II doesn't even take time for a recap, just plunges in more or less where Part I left off and after a while I felt like a tourist on one of those meticulously planned whirlwind foreign tours, events kept rushing along--'Okay, here's this! Here's that! Let's keep it moving, folks, you can take pictures from the bus!'  Part I told a wonderful story at what seemed it's own natural pace, and the three hours just flew by.  Part II always seems to be running late, and IT'S three hours just pile up.    **** POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWING  *******
When the new Gandalf appears with the cavalry to lift the siege of Helms Deep, that should have been a real cathartic charge for the audience, but it almost seems over before it starts; there should have been more depiction of the tide turning, as was the case in Bakshi's version.  Also there seemed to be too many things occurring simultaneously, what with Helms Deep AND the tree creatures showing up at Saruman's tower AND yet another battle with Frodo & Sam on hand.  It all seems to get cleared up lickety split so we can send the dynamic duo (plus Gollum) on their not-so-merry way to Part III.  I remember Tolkien's Book 3 much better than 2.  Jackson has his work cut out for him getting everything in.  If he just does justice to the Harrowing of the Shire, I'll settle for that.  Plus Sam's closing line.I almost envy the non-Tolkien viewers who can just watch a good yarn. Special mention for my single favorite shot, the procession of elves going away with the lanterns, plus the lugubriously juicy Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue, a performance every bit as career-capping as that of black-eyed Christopher Lee as Saruman.  Watch them in the tower scene with the army out front, it's two old veterans of cinema shlock working their magic.  I can't wait for their big Harrowing scene in Part 3.  DON'T SCREW THAT UP, JACKSON. Kudos to Jackson for the shots of the women & kids helplessly awaiting their fate in Helms Deep, reminding us that those most hurt in war aren't necessarily the warriors.",Null,1,2,18 December 2002
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Got smoke?
","The brilliance of George Clooney's 'Good Night and Good Luck' lies in it's very tight (almost claustrophobia-inducing) evocation of an early 1950's news studio with all those clean-cut button-down white guys (the few women on hand tend to get sent on errands) with their horn-rimmed glasses and their bottles of Scotch and their ubiquitous cigarettes. There is so much smoke wafting around that it becomes the element in which these guys function, like the water in a fish tank. Clooney didn't need to pound the point home by showing the ad for Kent cigarettes but I did get a chuckle out of it. The heady mixture of nicotine and testosterone palpably drives the news crew toward their fateful piece on Sen. Joe McCarthy which, for all they know in advance, may be the cliff over which their lives and careers plunge. Clooney has impressed me hugely with his ability to keep this great ensemble cast (including himself, not as the 'star') on pace. I avoided his 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' (having had my fill of that 'Gong Show' guy back in the Seventies) but I look forward to his future directorial efforts. D. Strathairn is quietly masterful as Edward R. Murrow; I look forward to being disappointed when the Academy snubs him for an Oscar nomination. The comparison between the anti-communism crusade then and the anti-terrorism crusade now is merely made available to be observed, not trumpeted to the heavens. The line 'Dissent is not disloyalty' sums it up pithily.Given what 'Night' does so well, it seems almost churlish on my part to mention some things it doesn't do and probably couldn't have done without disrupting it's artistic confines. I personally would have liked a sense of how the 'Red scare' permeated the populace as a whole; I would recommend Cedric Belfrage's book 'The American Inquisition' which includes annual 'fever charts' detailing that in 1953 the town of Moscow, Idaho demanded that the capital of the Soviet Union change it's name, or when citizens in Wisconsin were asked 'What is a Communist' responses included 'A crook, I suppose' or 'A person who wants war.' In 1954 a woman legally changed her name from Allred to Allgood and a high school in Idaho expunged the word 'comrade' from the school song. Sound a little silly? Does anyone remember 'freedom fries' recently? It also would've been a big mouthful to chew if 'Night' had made the point that 'Tailgunner Joe' was essentially a figurehead. He himself had little interest in communism until it became a ticket to fame; he got most of his headline-grabbing tidbits from the American Reichsfuehrer J. Edgar Hoover (McCarthy was a frequent guest in Hoover's private box at the local racetrack) and he was tolerated by General Eisenhower until he 'went too far' and denounced the army as 'pinko.' ('Night' mentions several real persons whose names were besmirched but not Major Irving Peress, the 'pink dentist,' whose family received threatening letters and phone calls and rocks thrown through their windows. 'Night' just barely hints at the anti-Semitic undercurrent of the phobia, culminating in the 'public burning' of the Rosenbergs for 'giving away the Bomb' based on evidence that would get laughed out of most courts today.) After McCarthy was allowed to 'twist in the wind' and drink himself to death, Hoover continued his police-state activities with other allies, but we never heard about any of this until 'Watergate.' Read 'The Boss' by Athan Theoharis and John S. Cox for the whole sordid story.By all means see 'Night' which deserves a ton of credit for getting people thinking about this again if nothing else. By the way, beware of revisionists like Ann Coulter claiming that McCarthy was validated by the 'Venona Project,' the secret program to intercept and decode Soviet diplomatic telegrams. Only a fraction of the cables were decrypted (some only partly) and their meaning is still debated by scholars. (The Soviets apparently did have two sources within the Manhattan Project, 'Quantum' and 'Pers,' who are still unidentified.) To assert, like Coulter, that 'hundreds of agents of an enemy foreign power were working for the U.S. government' is the kind of logical leap much favored by the Far Right .never mind where that lands.I wish that 'Night' had ended with a brief text mentioning that Murrow, a true American hero, died of lung cancer, thus completing the cigarette motif. I'm sure he would have ruefully allowed that there too, 'the fault lies not within our stars but within ourselves'",Null,35,42,31 October 2005
Mulholland Drive," Heard as well as seen
","Having seen 'Mulholland Drive' twice & listening now to the soundtrack on CD, I remember how important it is that David Lynch movies be closely listened to as well as watched.  Lynch is not so much a storyteller as an evoker of moods and he knows how subtly yet trenchantly music can operate upon the nervous system and psyche.  Lynch and his musical partner, the brilliant Angelo Badalamenti, create sounds that seem to arrive in our brains from within rather than without.  We respond to them in a very primal way.  Imagine for a moment any Lynch movie as a silent film; of course it would be visually arresting but ultimately wouldn't it register as a kind of circus freakshow? 'There's this strange thing, there's that strange thing...'  But the soundtrack binds with the imagery to keep it grounded in our emotional roots.  Does any other director even come close to this effective use of sound?  Most movie soundtracks function, oddly enough, in a way similar to when silent movies had some kind of musical accompaniment: as a kind of running commentary on and punctuation of the action, originating externally. This tends to keep the imagery 'safe.'  Lynch's soundtracks, originating internally, help make us feel we're not just watching the imagery but living it, as in a dream, and of course that's what makes dreams so spooky, the sense of being in them. Recently I re-read Orson Welles' comments to Peter Bogdanovich on his 'The Trial' & it kept reminding me of Lynch, the effect Welles said he'd been trying to engender.  (I think the essential tragedy of Welles is that he lived too early to be David Lynch. There was nothing close to the opportunities existing today for maverick filmmakers. 'The Trial,' which Welles called his most autobiographical film, is VERY Lynchian, there's even a scene of Anthony Perkins walking along a corridor to knock on a neighbor's door eerily like a scene in 'Eraserhead.') It seems ironic that a key scene in 'Mulholland Drive' took place in a club called 'Silencio' whose theme was to emphasize the disconnection between the seen and the heard.  Kinda like a magician pointing out how his tricks are done.  Anyway I guess it's clear by now I'm a Lynch fan, I've seen all his stuff except the early animated shorts (which not even the Facets people in Chicago seem to have available) and 'The Straight Story' which, I'll admit, scared me off with its G rating, but it should have occurred to me such external blandness would have been deliberate on Lynch's part.  'Drive' isn't likely to win Lynch any new fans, but those he already has should eat it up.  Just as Lynch makes a point of seeming not to care if people like his movies or not, we fans should acknowledge he's not everyone's cup of tea, and there's nothing wrong with that.  I for one certainly don't think I'm 'better than' a non-Lynch fan; 'different strokes,' etc. I hear zillions of people are going to see the Harry Potter movie, & Lord love 'm; I won't be one, but hey, maybe that means I'm the one missing out.  But it does grate on me more than a little when certain parties slag Lynch with phrases like 'onanistic self-regard,' as though denying he has a right to make movies in the first place.  Lynch is actually one of the LEAST self-indulgent directors (as was Welles).  He's grimly true to his light, whether he likes it or not.  The second time I saw 'Drive' the editing seemed almost Spartan---granted, I was aware of its TV origins etc.  But I've NEVER seen a Lynch movie where he seemed to dwell on something for its own sake & the rest of the movie could just wait.  Everything is meant to enhance the overall effect he wants.  One may not like the effect, one may not like what Lynch likes, one may not want to 'go there' etc., and again, that's fine.  But don't try to make him out some lazy hack, he doesn't deserve that.  I'm just glad he seems to be in the position where he DOESN'T need to be a hack. I had no idea what he was up to before 'Drive,' just figured when he was ready, he'd do something, & I'd go see it. I did regret, though, the TV series that never was, maybe Lynch should've tried HBO instead of ABC again. I sensed it could've been another 'Twin Peaks,' maybe even better.  Oh well.  Before I exceed my word-limit, just want to mention a scene from 'Drive' that hasn't had much comment that I've seen---hmmm, I don't think this is really a SPOILER, & does that really mean anything in Lynchland anyway?---it's when the zonked-out Naomi Watts is talking to the killer & his buddy in the alley.  Maybe that's the 'truest' scene in the movie?  One thing I've heard no one explain is--if she supposedly hired a killer, the money came from where, exactly?  Most real-life hired killers turn out to be undercover cops these days anyway.  Anyway I'll shut up now, but I do want to recommend the soundtrack on CD, & feel free to email me if you want to know more about Facets.",Null,0,0,19 November 2001
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A review-proof movie?
","If you've been alive and conscious in this country for the last few months, you will have seen ads and/or the trailer for 'Kill Bill' and/or articles in magazines/newspapers/the Internet and/or interviews with/appearances by Mr. Tarantino, Ms Thurman et al.  (Mr. Tarantino was on Jimmy Kimmel's show just last night, impishly suggesting 12-year-olds should pay to see 'Good Boy' then sneak into his movie.)  So everybody who would see it anyway knows what it's about and what Mr. T's trying to achieve.  Just as J.D. Salinger recommended decades ago that a writer should write what in his heart he most wants to read, Mr. T makes the movies he most wants to see.  I think he thinks his fans will also like it or will come around eventually, and to hell with the critics altogether.  So, did I like it?  Well, this is the first movie I've seen in years that I was actually sorry to see end. Would I recommend it?  Well, remember the ads: what you saw there is what you get in the movie, and then some, and then some more ....If this movie becomes a huge hit, I hope Ms Thurman will get the credit she deserves.  I was never a huge fans of hers before: another wan pallid languid blow-away-in-a-breeze blonde ingenue type, she struck me as being. I figured the brilliant performance Tarantino extracted from her in 'Pulp Fiction' was the exception proving the rule.  Well, pass me the seasoned salt so I can eat my crow, because Thurman blew me away in this.  She now has the life-experience in her face that wasn't there before, physically she's at her peak from all that martial-arts training, she invests every line reading and every facial expression with just the right degree of oomph.  Tarantino called her a 'goddess' recently.  In Europe she would be, benefiting from the reverence and great parts written for mature women over there.  Here?  Older actresses practically need their own production companies to get something other than the 'Honey, is everything okay?' parts.  (Mid-thirties is 'older' for Yank actresses, sorry to say.)Don't want to slight the rest of the cast, we just don't see much of them except for the priceless Lucy Liu, who lets her iconic character exude a kind of sad resonance.  Viveca Fox is just a shade too 'Yo, wussup' at times but then that's how Quentin wrote it, reminding us how he's 'down with the brothas.'  (Amazingly, there wasn't a single 'Nigger' in his script--er, excuse me, 'N-word.')   Fun to see the legendary Sonny Chiba in a semi-comedic wise-elder role, & the Japanese thugs (male and female) are all appropriately over the top. Barely recognized Darryl Hannah behind her eye-patch, which of course had a red cross on it when she was impersonating a nurse.Tarantino still eschews a straight linear narrative style, opening this story immediately after a mass murder (just as 'Reservoir Dogs' opened immediately after a botched bank robbery) and then bouncing back and forth in time, assisted by old-fashioned 'chapter headings.'  He immerses himself in his usual trash-pop culture (mostly Japanese this time around) and displays the casual technical craftiness of a master as his camera follows people up and down stairs, into and out of rooms, up to ceiling level or down on the floor, plus the standard eye-blink editing sequences favored nowadays.  And some of his imagery is just plain gorgeous, like when the bloodsoaked tea room gives way to the hauntingly serene fake-snow nightscape.  As always, he finds the music he wants.  (Nothing by Shona Knife, unfortunately.)A word about the violence: okay, yeah, it's violent---well, what were we expecting?  But not nearly as violent/gory as it could have been. There's an entire sequence done in animation and another one that eases into black and white at a crucial moment.  He deliberately uses the old-fashioned 'squibs.'  (Imagine if Kubrick had done a decapitation, how scientifically accurate it would've been.)  He manages to make his violence both painful and stylized, even weirdly playful at times.  There's nothing here like the 'sick' atmosphere that many people seemed to think was the end of civilization in the recent 'House of 1000 Corpses,' which actually had less violence/gore than 'Kill Bill.'   Tarantino makes it clear this is a capital-B-Movie (with modern production values, of course)--a B-with-Balls. But I hope people also notice what a strong moral sense he has.  I think it was no accident he used the term 'medieval' in 'Pulp Fiction.'  Remember the sequence beginning with the orderly and the big redneck entering Thurman's room, with the dialogue gradually revealing what's been going on over the four years of her coma.  We see evil, and we see it get punished.  He doesn't think he has to spell it out for us.There's already controversy over the decision to divide this flick into two parts released several months apart.  Personally I would've preferred one long movie with an intermission, to preserve the sweeping scope and emotional build-up, but I understand why these decisions get made.  It wasn't that long ago that 'Once Upon a Time in America' got butchered by businessmen contemptuous of the attention span and receptivity of the American MTV generation.  If this is what it takes so we can see all the movie that Tarantino wanted us to see, so be it.  He knows a lot is riding on this flick--he even kids it with the introduction 'The 4th Film of...' (Actually it's four-and-a-quarter if you count his contribution to 'Four Rooms,' which would've been a lot better if he'd directed the whole thing.) He knows he's like the new Orson Welles who never went to film school or 'worked his way up' through the biz.  He knows the burden of having adjectives made out of his name, viz. 'Tarantino-esque' or 'post-Tarentino.' He's heard all the personal crap & gossip about him.  Well, he shrugged it all off and now tells us 'Here's my movie, go see it if you want to.'  I for one think you should, even if you weren't 'into' his stuff before.  For sheer joyous audacious exuberance in filmmaking, there's no one like him today.  And remember people, if we don't support him he may have to go work (aaarrrgh) OVERSEAS.  He's ONE OF US, dammit, and I want him here.
Why hasn't Michael Parks had more work over the years?  Bless Tarantino for remembering people like him and Robert Forster ('Jackie Brown') and as far as I'm concerned, John Travolta should be sending Tarantino a Christmas card every year, preferably with a check in it....",Null,1,2,10 October 2003
From Hell," Wish I'd been made to care more.
","First off I haven't read the graphic novel that every review I've read has mentioned, so I don't care if it did or didn't do justice to that source. Just came to it as a Jack the Ripper movie. The trailer suggested it would knock my socks off.  It didn't, but I understand there were ratings considerations (as always) with the best stuff being saved for DVD.  Anyway this movie gets an A for effort for atmosphere and period detail, they really laid it on, down to the pimp's rotten tooth.  That alone mostly carried it for me, but I found it oddly uninvolving for the most part. Partly there's the problem of doing historical events, whether murders or something else, we know in advance what happened which eliminates much suspense.  But the murders here seemed almost perfunctory; when it was each victim's 'turn' she was conveniently alone on a deserted street just like the sleazy horror flicks we all laugh at.  No real terror ever generated. Only the proto-lobotomy scenes (& their aftermath) were truly horrifying. A lot of the conspiracy stuff reminded me of 'X-Files,' yanked me out of the period, likewise Depp's 'visions' a la 'Millennium' or 'Profiler.'  I know there was much drug use back then but would a hophead cop really have been tolerated, let alone be an Inspector?  It would've been interesting to see more details of Victorian police procedure, grilling suspects etc. (Fritz Lang's 'M,' also based on a real serial killer, was almost documentary in that sense.)  In fact the cops barely seemed to exist. I seem to be the only one who didn't have a problem with Heather Graham or her accent except that originally she was supposedly Irish & I didn't hear any of that in her voice.  She looked pretty but not 'Hollywood,' I thought.  Hey, nowadays there're beautiful women who do porn flicks, what's their excuse?  The ending was anticlimactic and disappointing, almost made me glad I hadn't been made to care too much about these people.  Depp was okay, the old English theater guys were fun, but Robbie Coltrane lit up the screen as always, just wish he'd been given more to do. Ultimately the movie's a nice foggy ride but could've used the ballocks of the Hughes' earlier black urban flicks, it's like they felt they had to curtsy here.",Null,1,2,20 October 2001
Mystic River," An Imperfect World?
","Now that the Boston Red Sox have lived up to (or down to) the notorious Curse of the Bambino for the umpteenth time, let me address this movie about people many of whom wear Red Sox caps.  (In the bottom of the eighth with one out, one on and a two run lead over the Yankees, what swayed manager Grady Little to let Pedro pitch to Matsui and then Posada instead of bringing in Embree?  Was it Pedro himself, or the ghost of Ruth whispering in his ear?)  South Boston, or 'Southie,' the Irish enclave remembered for it's anti-busing riots in the 1970s and where a respected legislator had a brother who was a notorious gangster, has always been proud of it's clannish anti-authority way of life.  This story focuses on three guys from Da Naybahood with common demons to be exorcised.********  POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW  *************************
At the outset we see three kids playing street hockey (the one who grows up to be Sean Penn is especially well cast) who, after losing their ball down a sewer, kill some time carving their names into some wet cement.  A rough-looking mug with handcuffs dangling from his belt announces he's a cop, asks where they all live and demands that the kid who lives more than a few blocks away get into his car.  Of course we modern viewers who know about sexual predators are inwardly urging the kids to run away, but director Clint Eastwood (who, I wish, would just direct from now on; I really don't want to see him get any older on-screen) puts the time and place to good use: it's BECAUSE the creep barks profanity at them that these slum kids believe he's a cop.(Had Clint asked me, I would have suggested he not show any of the kid's captivity or abuse, to make that good ol' power of suggestion work for him. Also, did we really need one of the perverts to be wearing a crucifix? Didn't Clint already take his shot at Christianity in 'A Perfect World'?)Twenty-five or thirty years later these three fish still live in the same bowl.  One became Penn, a semi-reformed small-time crook with lots of tattoos who runs a grocery store; one became Kevin Bacon, a glum State Police detective whose wife has left him; the molested kid became Tim Robbins, who doesn't seem to have a job and walks around in a kind of trance most of the time.  The plot is triggered by the violent death of Penn's feisty daughter who's been dating a guy behind her father's back.  I haven't read the novel upon which this movie is based, so I don't know how important the 'whodunnit' aspect originally was, but here it seems almost an excuse for Eastwood to revel in the squalor of these unhappy little lives. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland is always inclined toward allegory but in his better scripts, such as 'LA Confidential,' there's enough quirky detail to bring it all to life; here the characters are so isolated they might as well be on stage in 'Waiting for Godot': they don't watch TV, except for Robbins watching a horror movie that leads into an awkward aria about the living dead; they take no interest in world, national or local news; they don't go to Little League games or wash their cars or play bingo at church events; they just look depressed and express varying degrees of angst. The only signs of life are from a couple of local lowlifes (subtly named Savage) who made me wish they had their own movie, just as someone wrote a play about Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from 'Hamlet.' Eventually the 'mystery' gets resolved, but the 'real' climax involves Penn's vigilante quest for his daughter's killer & even that is pretty predictable once Penn gets the notion Robbins is the killer.  Eastwood's clunky handling of suspense makes even old black and white silent flicks look as slick as Brian De Palma in comparison.  Credit to Eastwood for not trying to concoct a 'happy ending' with 'closure.'  It ends with the major characters watching a parade---'here we are in our little enclave with life passing us by'--- each wrapped up in his or her own concerns.  Missing are the dead girl and her overwrought boyfriend, who if he had any sense followed through on his plan to leave town, with or without her...Other than Penn chewing up the scenery and Marcia Gay Harden doing more wide-eyed horror-stricken takes than Fay Wray in her prime, all the actors do a good subtle job.  Robbins in particular brings some nice dark shadings to a character who reminds us there's nothing 'ennobling' about being a victim of something.  The technical aspects are all fine.  Director Eastwood is doggedly determined to 'pace' the scenes, but I kinda admire that nowadays.  The kids in the audience can get back to their frenetic video-game lives soon enough.  A major treat is Laurence Fishburn as Bacon's police partner, nicknamed 'Whitey.'  The script never addressed this apparent anomaly, which I kinda enjoyed.  Only a few quibbles: so many items of apparent plot importance that we don't get to 'see,' only hear discussed.  'What, somebody had a gun?  Somebody was sending money?  What was that about Brooklyn?' ..... etc. Also the device of having Bacon's ex-wife call and say nothing, allowing him to 'vent': that seemed really really really really lame.And so to these hapless beleaguered characters and the baseball team that's broken a whole region's hearts so many times: all the best to y'all, & there's always 'next year'....But damn: Wakefield wins two games for the Sox in that series and then gives up a first-pitch homer in the bottom of the eleventh, to the kid from the Cincinnati Reds yet?   Isn't that just a little too much Curse to bear?",Null,1,2,16 October 2003
Signs," Screw 'The Sixth Sense'
","Poor old M. Night Shyamalan.  He happens to make a movie ('The Sixth Sense') that does amazing business based essentially on a goofy plot twist, & now, I guess, he's 'the plot twist guy' for the rest of his life.  Somebody has to be 'the new Hitchcock,' so I guess it's him.  He's not allowed to be 'just' a talented filmmaker any more.  Orson Welles spent his whole life trying to 'live down' 'Citizen Kane'; hope the same's not in store for M. Night.
M. Night makes 'spiritual thrillers.'  He did it before 'The Sixth Sense,' he's done it since, & I imagine he'll go on doing it.  If his name were just Fred Smith & if there hadn't been 'Sixth Sense,' I imagine he'd be seen as a promising indie director at this point, with critical appreciation for his loyalty to the southeastern Pennsylvania region.  But dammit, thanks to 'Sixth Sense' he's doomed to fine-toothed critical scrutiny & high audience expectations.  But he can't do 'Sixth Sense' again--even if he wanted to---it wouldn't work.   We should just let him do the work he wants to do & take it on that basis.
This is a hard movie to discuss without constantly veering near Spoiler territory.  'Spoilers' only apply to people who haven't seen the movie yet, so for such people who may be reading this, I'll say this: The 'extraterrestrial' aspects really aren't the point.  This isn't like an 'X-files' episode, or the movie of same.  The point is how the character s REACT TO what they think they're experiencing.  A key scene is when Mel Gibson's son is reading the book about aliens.  We see the book with its illustrations of (by now) 'garden-variety' aliens.  There's a reason M. Night spends so much time on that book.  It's his way of saying: 'I'm trying to establish a common lexicon here, I'm establishing the basis for my characters' later emotional reactions. I'm not 'breaking new ground.' This is not Sci-Fi, & it's definitely not 'X-Files.''   M. Night is keenly aware of all the great trashy old 1950s flicks most of which just relied on the 'alien conventions' of the time.  (He even has a character make a reference to 'The War of the Worlds.')   So whatever folks see in this flick that may seem 'derivative' or 'disappointing' or whatever, remember, M. Night isn't trying to be Spielberg or Lucas.  He wants to know what YOU would do in such a situation; face it, wouldn't most of us be scared crapless if just a 'regular' human intruder were trying to get inside?  Imagine if it were something beyond that; the scenes where Gibson et al. grapple with this are by far the best in the flick.  If anything, I wish far more had been done with that aspect of it.  I wish there'd been a lot more 'build-up,' a lot more 'bump in the night' stuff.  (The 'Blair Witch' flick showed how far one could go with  ONLY 'bump in the night' stuff.)   The cleverly edited trailer certainly suggested it'd be that sort of flick.  M. Night, were he so inclined, could make a a career of scaring the bejabbers out of us, he must be the best 'point-of-view' director currently working.  (It used to be Walter Hill, as in 'What ever happened to...')   There are moments in this movie that are just electrifying in terms of suspense.  He can make us squirm when he wants to.  But evidently he has 'bigger fish to fry.'
That, I must confess, is where he starts to lose me.  He's hugely interested in 'faith' in general, & I'm not.  But that's just a personal thing with yours truly: I couldn't care less what people think, believe or say; I only care what people do.  I know Gibson's Catholic in his personal life & at first I thought he was playing a Catholic priest but then 'Wait, he's married with kids.....'  Turns out he's Episcopalian, they wear a similar uniform but with a subtle collar difference; I hadn't known they were also called 'Father.'  So he's lost his faith, yadda yadda.   I couldn't really 'relate to' any of that, but I imagine may viewers can.   The whispered conversation between Gibson & Phoenix reminded me a lot of the one in 'Poltergeist' with the dwarf explaining everything.Ultimately I found this movie oddly uninvolving.   The characters should've been a lot more 'pro-active.'  Never mind the damn baseball bat on the wall, the notion of a household in Bucks County, Pennsylvania with no guns in it is pretty farfetched, even if it's an ex-reverend's house.  Too much passivity occurring.   Neither Gibson nor Phoenix seemed to have a current job.  We didn't see enough activity on the part of local govt. agencies--there's a LOT of that in Pennsylvania, trust me. The previous Pennsylvania film maestro, George Romero of Pittsburgh, always presented that to us in spades.  M. Night may want to follow suit.Good acting for the most part; I especially liked the gung-ho army recruiter & the paranoid book dealer (that same actor was in the 'Blair Witch' sequel that was liked, apparently, by no one except yours truly).  Lots of comedic moments.  Maybe M Night should make comedies with scary aspects rather than melodramas with comedic moments.  I for one heard a lot more laughs than gasps in the cinema.
Bottom line, it's a well-made flick & worth seeing, as was 'Unbreakable,' but neither of them is 'Sixth Sense', nor should we expect to see another such from M. Night.  He had his fluke hit (with a nod to 'Carnival of Souls') & now let's let him have his career & we hope he'll still get some viewers.",Null,0,1,4 August 2002
Identity," Maybe I should quit watching trailers...
","If I hadn't seen the trailer for 'Identity' I probably would have had more of an open mind for the various screenwriting hijinks that crop up in it. Someone said this movie is like the 'Twilight Zone' TV series, which seems apt.  I always used to enjoy 'Twilight Zone,' but the key to that was KNOWING that's what I was watching.  The trailer for 'Identity' suggested it would be a quirky little modern variation on those kill-'m-one-by-one classics like 'The List of Adrian Messenger' with the killer possibly involved with 'identity theft,' certainly a hot-button issue nowadays. And for a while 'Identity' is enjoyable on just such a level.Various characters are driving in the remote Nevada desert when a thunderstorm and ensuing mishaps force them together into the umpteenth Norman-Batesian movie motel.  (I think Mr. Hitchcock did an entire industry rather a disservice.  I've spent many nights in motels and have never been murdered nor do I know anyone who has been, and the proprietors have always seemed pretty nice, especially this one middle-aged Indian lady with gorgeous braided hair.)  The phone lines seem to be down and it goes without saying that no one has a functioning cell phone, so they're stuck there together.  Events play out in a refreshingly non-linear fashion somewhat reminiscent of David Lynch.  Every character seems just a little off-center with something to hide.  Small quick moments pique our interest: John Cusack as a limousine driver furtively pulls out a gun; Amanda Peet as a prostitute opens her bag revealing wads of cash; Ray Liotta as a corrections officer puts on a shirt with a suspicious hole in the back, etc.  It was nice not knowing an hour in advance where everything was going.  In short I was 'buying into' the proceedings, enjoying the ride.   But then we get the Rod Serling stuff  (a guy flees the motel and winds up back there, etc.) and talk of Indian burial grounds, making me groaningly wonder if we were steaming into 'Blair Witch' waters.  Then we get the bombshell....
SPOILERS ***** SPOILERS *****  SPOILERS *******
It turns out none of this is really happening.  It all takes place inside the mind of a convicted murderer.  This was so frustrating as to tempt me to walk out on a movie for the first time in years.  Never mind the dubious psychological underpinnings about 'multiple personalities' and all that. Dramatically the movie simply cuts it's own throat.  It negates whatever interest we had invested in the previous or the subsequent proceedings. Everything that happens afterward seems ridiculous--the shoot-out between Cusack and Liotta, the escape of Peet, the orange grove, etc.  It's all just a stunt.  Lickety-split we're supposed to give a crap about the big bald-headed lug and his state of mind as the crux of the movie.  At least'The Cell' gave us a foundation for the fandango into the mind of a psycho killer.  'Identity' just springs it on us out of the blue.  How many damn 'Sixth Sense' knock-offs do we need?  After 'The Life of David Gale' and 'Basic' and others and now this, frankly I'm tired of having my cinematic emotional investments toyed with so flippantly.  I think we need a new rating: T for Twist, or SPT for Stupid Pointless Twist.  Director James Mangold has a reputation for being grounded in reality and it was mostly due to that quality that I enjoyed his previous 'Cop Land.'  I think he should go back to writing his own scripts.
Making it even more frustrating is seeing such good acting all around get wasted.  Everybody shines here.  Cusack is genuinely creepy yet sympathetic, confirming the promise I saw in 'Grosse Pointe Blank.'  Liotta (also in 'Cop Land') has been down this road before but always makes it seem fresh. (Please, if you see 'Narc' on video, rent it; Liotta's awesome in it.) Peet gives what should be a star-making performance.  Hell, she made me enjoy 'Saving Silverman' against all my expectations.  There's even an unrecognizable Rebecca de Mornay in a gloriously trashy cameo as a John Waters-type leading lady.  Yet they all have to play second fiddle to the bald guy with three names who gets thrust upon us as the focus of our concerns.  Hey, call me a Dennis Miller acolyte but you know what, if a guy kills a bunch of people, I don't really care what's inside his head, I don't care which 'self' did it.  Kill the body, that pretty much covers it.'Identity' begins and ends with that goofy little doggerel about meeting a man who wasn't there, and wishing he'd go away.  Not since 'Jeepers Creepers' has there been such a lame pop-culture reference.  Give me any time the jump-rope ditty from 'Nightmare on Elm Street':  'One two, Freddie's coming for you; three four, better close the door...'",Null,0,0,3 May 2003
Lucy," OK, so now what does Luc Besson do for an encore?
","From 'La Femme Nikita' onwards I've been a big fan of his, in fact he's the only foreign director I can think of whose name alone would pull me into a movie theater. I've been trying to put my finger on just what it is that makes his stuff so capital-W watchable; maybe it's his ability to combine an innately playful (even zany) quality with gut-wrenchingly brutal violence and cruelty into a seamless whole; add to that an aura of inevitability that maybe one just has to be European to be able to render, the moments of joy in the face of impending doom. Being French in particular, he can't help but ponder deep philosophical issues amidst the gun battles and car chases, and with Lucy he's decided to 'shoot the moon,' try to capture the entire essence of human nature and potential. As they supposedly like to say in New Orleans, 'Let the good times roll....' Your reaction to this movie will depend entirely on how well you think Scarlett Johansson carries off the title role. I have to 'fess up that before this I of course had heard of her but had never actually seen her in something. As per the late Siskel and Ebert, thumbs up for me. She plays the significant other of a shady sort called Richard (who wears a straw cowboy hat for no clear reason) who lives in Taiwan and works for a mysterious kingpin called Mr. Jang. He insists she carry a briefcase into a hotel lobby for him but won't tell her what's in it, and when she shrewdly resists, he literally handcuffs her to it. Her latent terror combined with desperate hope that all will turn out well is exquisitely manifested by Ms Johansson. It turns out that she and a few hapless others have been designated by Mr. Jang to be human mules for some super-synthetic drug which she accidentally ingests into her system. This gives her a 'brain boost' (to borrow a term from 'Forbidden Planet') resulting in steadily increasing superhuman abilities. Much wackiness ensues as the action shifts to France involving gangsters and cops and also the apparently immortal Morgan Freeman as a professor whose function is to render arcane scientific concepts digestible for most of us movie viewers. There's a lot here that can fairly be described as derivative; one nay saying critic referred to half a dozen titles he saw as influences for 'Lucy' (I'm surprised he missed '2001: A Space Odyssey'). Certain plot holes can seem like black holes, such as the sequence where she seems to be disintegrating inside an airplane restroom---which by the way must be one of the most gorgeously ominous things I've seen on screen---next thing we know, she's bodily intact again. But these quibbles, while valid, seem to be missing the point, which is to let oneself get swept along for this ultra-Bessonian ride with Ms Johansson the ever calmer rock upon which we can position ourselves. This may sound corny, but by the time Lucy finally surpasses the need for corporeality but informs us via someone's cell phone that she is 'everywhere,' I personally found that reassuring. Kudos also to the other actors, in particular Min-sik Choi as Mr. Jang; he is quite possibly the best actor on the planet---okay, a bold statement, but catch him in 'Oldboy' and his other Korean flicks--in fact, 'Oldboy' alone should do it for you. (I didn't even dream of contaminating my memory of 'Oldboy' by watching the American remake.) Also very nice use by Besson of various pieces of stock footage, it all fits right in. Great evocative music too, I may even buy the soundtrack CD. So bottom line, don't worry if this movie is 'cool' or not (seems to be doing okay at the box office). It'll be dark in the theater, no one has to see you enjoying yourself....",Null,2,19,31 July 2014
Sin City," I can see why they're called 'graphic' novels..... (possible spoilers)
","With so many movies nowadays being based on comic books---excuse me, 'graphic novels' now---I almost feel like an interloper in the audience. So I try to ignore the movie's origins and just take it on it's own merits. I went to see 'Hellboy' because I like Guillermo Del Toro's stuff (and was not unhappy with it) and I went to see 'Sin City' because I like Robert Rodriguez' stuff. I once read a few pages of a 'Sin City' story (it had a woman handcuffed to a bed, fans presumably will know which one it was) and found it visually very striking (this was in a bookstore and I would have felt guilty reading more without buying it). Clearly Rodriguez wanted that exact look for his film, everything stylized. Warren Beatty tried that once with 'Dick Tracy,' with mixed results. I would call these results also (decidedly) mixed.Like 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,' also shot in front of screens, the visual aura alone is enough to keep one's attention riveted, whether or not the action being viewed makes a lot of sense. Inevitably (and probably intentionally) the characters are somewhat two-dimensional, especially when the make-up makes them look like cartoons, the most extreme example in 'Sin City' being of course the 'Yellow Bastard' who reminded me of a character in one of the 'Star Trek' spin-offs on TV. This keeps the viewer at a certain distance from the proceedings, making it harder to become emotionally involved with the characters but easier to cope with the violence that occurs, and trust me, there's a lot of it here, and it's really nasty. But unlike some comic-based flicks set in real places with 'ordinary' people involved, the 'Basin City' in this movie has no specified region or time period and no one seems to live there except cops, crooks and prostitutes. In a way it reminded me of 'Last Man Standing' (also with Bruce Willis) where the 'town' had no population except two rival gangs and a passive sheriff. All these people seem to exist for no reason except to kill and/or be killed, as nastily as possible. There's a corrupt Senator lording it over everyone rather like a medieval feudal lord. But in the Middle Ages the peasants really had no options. In Sin City the characters have automobiles (1950's vintage, including a gorgeous Chevy Bel Air) but it never seems to occur to anyone to get into one of these and drive it to another town where maybe life is slightly less horrible.In 'Kill Bill,' directed by Rodriguez' 'brother' Quentin Tarantino, there was also a lot of stylized violence but with an emotional resonance because one could get caught up in what was happening with Uma Thurman as our 'alter ego.' 'Sin City' has several chronologically overlapping stories a la Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' but without the latter's mordant charm or quirky humor. It's a more or less non-stop exploration of ever more inventive ways to kill and/or torture and/or abuse people. After a while I was thinking 'Shouldn't someone just nuke this effing place and put all these people out of their misery?' It would've made more sense if it had turned out to be set on some foreign planet, like 'Dark City' or John Norman's 'Gor' novels. Here's what I think the problem boils down to: in a movie with even the most fantastical of premises, there has to be a kind of 'inroad' of perception for the audience (at least for some of us). As Monty Python's John Cleese once put it, 'Once you choose your 'crazy' premise, you must stick to it absolutely rigidly.' There has to be some kind of hook upon which we can hang our figurative viewing hats. For some, of course, the 'violence buzz' is plenty. 'Hey, there's a guy with his arms and legs chopped off, and he's getting eaten by a wolf!!! Can they top that?....' 'Hey, there's a mutant freak whipping a woman whom he'd also raped when she was a child, and now he's getting pounded into an amorphous mass!!! Can they top that?...' etc.(Just for the record, when the young girl was sitting tied to a chair getting menaced by the creep, that pretty much soured the rest of it for me. Stuff like that happens in real life and if I have to see it in the movies, I want to see it in a real-life context. Maybe I'm just showing my age.) The actors all seemed to be giving Rodriguez (and credited co-director Frank Miller) what he wanted. Powers Booth as the evil Senator made the best impression on me; with this and his equally visceral work as whorehouse boss Cy Tolliver on HBO's 'Deadwood,' he seems to have come full circle to when he blew me away as the Rev. Jim Jones many moons ago. Mickey Rourke, always underrated as an actor I thought, was amazingly effective under his facial prosthetics. The chicks were all pretty cute---I put it that way deliberately, since that seemed to be why they were there.One final bit of grumpiness: what was the point of inserting a set of IRA types as villains? By reminding us of the existence of these real killers of real people (including the recent knifing of a Catholic guy in a bar) the movie just highlighted the rest of it's own 'alien-ness.' Why not throw in Al Qaeda while they were at it? Gotta admit, though, 'Sin City' looks darn good. Can't recall when I've seen such sadistic nihilism presented with so much flair and panache. Heck, Mr. Rodriguez could give Japan's Mr. Miike a run for his money. It's all just a comic book anyway, so enjoy!",Null,2,5,2 April 2005
Gangs of New York," Taking the Mickey Out of History
","For those unfamiliar with this expression, 'taking the mickey out of' something means kidding it, spoofing it, 'having it on.'  In it's origins, of course, it was yet another slur against the Irish.  This film draws upon a real-life historical situation, i.e. Irish immigration and slum life in New York in the 1840s and later (as documented by Charles Dickens in 'American Notes,' among others) and a real-life event, i.e. the 'draft riots' in New York in 1863 that turned into race rioting between the Irish and the blacks, and presents a dramatic tale intertwined with the American Civil War, the greatest intranational cataclysm in our brief history. It's an ambitious undertaking, to say the least.Our 'hero' is the son of a murdered Irish-American gang leader called 'Priest' (the great Liam Neeson in too short a role) whose 'Dead Rabbits' are seen preparing for battle in some endless catacombs under the slums. Martin Scorsese's trademark fluid camerawork is put to good use as the gang members march along underground until they kick out a door to emerge into a snow-covered street--New York's 'Five Points' neighborhood, 1846.  (Nice to see a movie with actual physical sets, not computer generated.)  There follows a brutal battle with a gang of 'natives' led by the chameleon-like Daniel Day-Lewis.  (It took me a while to get used to Day-Lewis' accent, especially since no other character has one like it.)  After the battle we jump ahead 16 years just as Priest's son, who has become Leonardo Di Caprio, emerges from a prisonlike orphanage.  On his way back home to Five Points he flings his Bible into a river, yet later he seeks solace in religious rituals, thus displaying the ambivalence toward religion that's a common theme in Scorsese's films.Scorsese's narrative approach resembles that of his masterpiece 'Goodfellas' with the voice-over and the quasi-documentary introduction to the local characters.  'Then there were the Plug Uglies, they spoke their own language...'  The period recreation is sufficiently fascinating (hats off to Italy for being so accommodating) complete with period slang ('You needed sand to be a turtledove') that for a while it's enough to follow along without worrying about the plot too much.  The movie's trailer suggested this is a revenge story but the hero, who's called Amsterdam for some reason, doesn't seem to be in any big hurry with his revenge, even coming under the wing of the same gangster who killed his father and now seems to be the 'Don' of the neighborhood.  For a while we're not even sure he still wants revenge, which I enjoyed, because in 'real life' we're also not always entirely sure what we want, or how to go about it.  Inevitably a romantic element arises, then the plot wheels start to grind.This is when 'Gangs' starts to feel forced, as all the elements need to mesh in a timely manner.
****  POSSIBLE SPOILERS FROM HERE ONWARDS ******
The jump-start comes when Amsterdam's pallid friend Johnny gives away his true identity to Bill 'the Butcher,' apparently because the beautiful pickpocket whom he'd courted chose Amsterdam instead.  This made me groan a little; I mean jeez, it's SUCH a movie commonplace, how we male people supposedly think with our reproductive organs.  It doesn't seem to occur to our Johnny that he'll be killed one way or another, so maybe he IS thinking with his 'little head.'  The Butcher then becomes very surly but allows his duplicitous protege to live so that, of course, the movie's opening scene can be reprised.  But by now we also have the Big Historical Events going on, and shortly there is so much violence from so many quarters--the two gangs preparing to rumble, and the race riots, and the Civil War, and windows breaking, and cannons going off, and beatings and lynchings and stabbings and shootings and bashings--that what emerges is not so much catharsis as shellshock.  When it finally comes down to the two crippled warriors blearily staring each other down through the gunsmoke, it's almost a relief knowing one or both of them will finally die.  The ending, a series of fast-forward dissolves reminiscent of 'Zardoz' and others, is definitely a 'downer,' but at least exudes a kind of calmness.Bottom line: Less would have been More here.  The story we thought we saw outlined in the trailer would have been plenty involving, as was Henry Hill's story in 'GoodFellas,' and all the social commentary could have ensued from it.  Too many characters jockey for prominence here.  For a while it seems to be Amsterdam's movie, and then Bill the Butcher's, and then William 'Boss' Tweed's and then someone else's.  Someone like Robert Altman can pull off such a kaleidoscopic effort because an Altman flick is like a jazz tune, each element being a riff, but for the detail-obsessed Scorsese, each element gets the full orchestration treatment.  He doesn't know how to soft-pedal anything.  Insofar as he was working from a story by the visionary former film critic Jay Cocks, he would have been well served to remember a movie from 1955 called 'Night of the Hunter' with a script by visionary former film critic James Agee that novice director Charles Laughton honed into an intimate little story over which the gloomy Depression stuff loomed without being obtrusive.  'Gangs' cries out for this kind of intimacy.  I'm profoundly sorry someone like Paul Schrader wasn't available to write the screenplay, but I guess he was busy with 'Auto Focus.'Fine acting all around.  Day-Lewis' melancholy monster is the character you'll remember most.  Some have griped that Cameron Diaz looks too good, but hey, this is (the spirit of) Hollywood, get over it.  (Does anyone remember Scorsese's 'New York New York'?  Even his indie stuff was stylized. He was never Mr. Realism.)  Some have griped about the accents.  Well, Di Caprio and Diaz were supposed to be 'Irish-American' not Irish and anyway, who really knows how anybody sounded in the era before voice recordings? As always with Scorsese, there's effective editing and  use of music and pull-no-punches violence both physical and verbal---and yeah, they did use the F-word even back then.  And that camera work--I just need to mention one shot where we see a line of new Union soldiers marching along , the camera follows them backwards up to their boat and then up and back and over back to the docks where we see a coffin being unloaded from the same boat, pull back to see a line of coffins on the same dock--it's only a minute or two in length, it's visual poetry and it speaks volumes.  God bless you, Martin, you are the ONLY director whose name alone will get me into a movie theater.

Hustle & Flow," With apologies to Michael Moore, one can be a 'stupid white man' and still like this movie....
","To quote from the Cramps' anthemic cover of the 1950's hit 'Rocket in my Pocket': 'Well I don't know about art but I know what I like.' I sure don't know much about Rap/Hip-Hop/Krump/Crunk/whatever, but I know a nice little well-told story when I see one. I'll admit 'Hustle & Flow' had not exactly been high on my must-see list but this past Saturday I really wanted to go to a movie; since I don't live in New York or Chicago or Los Angeles, what was available was stuff I'd either seen or didn't care to see. Then I thought 'Well hell, let's give this a shot.' Proved to be a good decision on my part.We're introduced to a somewhat unassuming-looking black guy in his mid-to-late-30's sitting in his vintage car smoking a cigarette as he lays out some down-home philosophy (which gets tellingly repeated near the end) to an unseen character who then is revealed as a young strung-out-looking white chick. If we hadn't known in advance, we needn't have been Einstein to grasp that she's a prostitute and he's her pimp. Eventually a customer pulls up; when the pimp's initial sales pitch fails to sink in, he exasperatedly tells his 'ho' to (paraphrasing somewhat) 'explain to this gentleman how this situation should proceed.' She gets into the john's car and off they go as the pimp sits and watches and smokes. I don't know how the pimp knows that the client is not some psycho who wants to murder his employee. I suppose one develops a 'sixth sense' for that sort of thing.The pimp is played by Terrence Howard, about whose performance even haters of the move have been raving. I kept wondering where the heck I'd seen this guy before---turned out he'd been in 'Crash' which I'd seen relatively recently, as a completely different kind of character. As the pimp he's rock solid, never hits a wrong note, a guy born on the wrong side of the wrong tracks suffering from being just intelligent enough to know what a waste his life has been thus far. He sucks on those cigarettes like an oxygen tube. He's followed the 'path of least resistance' to become a pimp, has three in his 'stable' under his roof; one of them has an infant son, plus another one is pregnant; it's all he can do to keep them all and himself more or less functioning. I doubt I've ever seen a pimp portrayed this realistically in a movie before. I've known plenty of managers in 'legitimate' jobs who didn't remotely have the level of 'people skills' needed here.He takes possession of a Casio mini-keyboard which in the movie's best scene he uses to pacify the squalling son of one of his hookers. This gets him thinking about a music career like that of one 'Skinny Black,' a Memphis 'homeboy' he may or may not have known once. He enlists the help of a childhood chum to concoct a recording studio in his home with egg crates stapled to the walls for sound-proofing; they have to turn the fan off to record and (in the second best scene) the pimp has to go placate his hostile neighbor (using marijuana, apparently the universal medium of exchange) whose music is seeping into their recording session. There's a nice atmosphere in all this of 'real' people giving it their all to break into a tough business, hinting back to those 'Let's put on a show in the barn!' epics from the 1930's. I couldn't begin to say if the music they eventually record is 'good' or 'bad' by the standards of that genre, but they sure put a lot of heart into it. The bashful stammering pregnant woman who gets dragooned into being a backup singer and who blossoms with each 'take' is an absolute joy to watch. She alone was enough to make me believe this really was the South.Unfortunately it gets a little formulaic towards the end with the requisite violence which we know in advance won't lead to death because at that point too much time has been invested for such a drastic departure. The 'somewhat happy' ending seems just a little contrived. But it's all played with absolute conviction & I for one was perfectly happy to 'buy into' it. Not since my 1990's favorites 'Smoke Signals' and 'Ulee's Gold' has a movie made such an appealingly 'human' impression on me. It may be the first movie this year since 'Kung Fu Hustle' that I see twice.Towards the end the pimp tells his friend that if the new baby of a prostitute and an unknown john ever asks him if she could be President, 'I'll look her in the eye and lie to her.'cause sometimes that's what you gotta do.' Damn, that was poignant. Some day, I reckon, there'll be a black President, and a female President, maybe even both at once; it'd be kinda cool if I could live to see that.The part of the church-going somewhat-happily-married sound engineer must have been a cakewalk for Anthony Anderson after his turn as the demonic drug lord on the best cop show on TV, i.e. 'The Shield.' This guy has a genuinely approachable 'everyman' quality; I predict he'll have the next long-running 'mainstream' sitcom after that of Bill Cosby and Will Smith.....",Null,0,0,7 August 2005
V for Vendetta," This can't be about George Bush, the dictator's way too articulate.....
","'V for Vendetta' begins promisingly in a London apartment about twenty years hence with Natalie Portman apparently getting ready for a date (even though it's almost eleven pm) and barely paying attention to a guy on TV holding forth about 'the former United States' having been doomed by sin and corruption, unlike England which apparently has morphed into fascism under the aegis of religion and anti-terrorism. Natalie goes out hoping to beat the 'yellow curfew' (how many of us have zoomed to catch a yellow light in traffic?) but runs afoul of three 'finger men' who seize the opportunity for a 'bit o' fun.' Right on cue appears a black-clad masked rescuer who after dispatching the finger men subjects poor ol' Natalie to the longest, most opaque speech I've heard in a movie in years (or maybe ever). The puzzled look on her face probably mirrored mine. After the stranger has exhausted every V-word in the English language (except maybe 'vampire' and 'vivisection') he invites her along to a mysterious rooftop 'concert.' If you accept that she takes him up on it, you'll probably take the rest of the film in stride; if not, you probably won't.There's something about 'V' that just seems a little 'off'; hard to put one's finger on it. It's not the liberal borrowing of elements from other movies, including the later scenes in 'Pink Floyd The Wall' for the visual aura; it's not the forced marriage of humor and cruelty; it's not the gaps in plot and character; we overlook those all the time if what's on screen is working for us. I think the problem is what George Bush Sr. called 'the vision thing.' Depictions of the future, especially a tyrannical future or otherwise gone awry, need to appear to have sprung forth fully formed like Athena from the mind of Zeus. 'THX 1138,' 'Death Race 2000,' 'Bladerunner,' 'Brazil,' 'Ultraviolet' all have this in common: everything in them contributes to the desired effect and/or message. 'V,' though, is all over the map. Natalie's boss at the former BBC (now the 'BNT') turns out to be a closet dissident who has a whole secret section of his house devoted to contraband like a copy of the Koran, because he knows he'd be in deep doo-doo just for having it; yet he produces a TV sketch lampooning the dictator and seems stunned when the government goons kick down his door. Well, which is it: are people living in fear of this regime, or not? Also part of my problem with 'V' is Ms. Portman herself; she's game enough and her accent is credible, but there's something lacking in terms of screen presence; she reminds me of Gertrude Stein's famous comment about Oakland, California: 'There's no THERE there.' Her 'Evey' never really registers as a flesh-and-blood person; her personality and even intelligence level shift according to the needs of the plot. She even disappears for a while and once she's back, one wonders what she's been doing, but all we learn is that she went to a store and didn't get recognized by a former co-worker, presumably due to her shaved head; I'll admit she's the cutest bald chick since Persis Khambatta in 'Star Trek The Motion Picture.' But there is stuff to enjoy in 'V,' some droll lines (a TV type: 'We don't fabricate the news, that's what the government does') and good performances, especially Steven Rea as a cop with a dollop of integrity left and John Hurt in his best role in years as the fire-breathing dictator who only talks to his subordinates on a huge screen while they sit in a dark room like game-show contestants; some striking imagery (a shot of emaciated corpses in a mass grave almost torques the whole thing into another milieu) and some timely caveats for Americans who seem to be letting 9-11-01 be used by political opportunists to disabuse them of those pesky civil rights. But here's my major quibble (and where the spoiler alert comes in): when it's revealed that the torture scenes (Natalie getting her head shaved, dunked in water, dumped on a barren cell floor) were all staged by the masked man himself as some kind of test for his putative protégé for whom he's supposedly developing all this affection, my suspension of disbelief sagged considerably. It was like the revelation in 'The Village' that the 'pioneers' were all modern people: 'You bastards, you let a sick kid die at the outset and then you sent a blind girl stumbling through the woods where she might fall into a hole or get hit by a car once she reached the road? Rot in hell, or at least jail.' Or in this case: 'You bastard, how did you know she wouldn't drown or die in her cell or try to kill herself or be mentally scarred for life?' I mean even a fire-disfigured 'monster' needs some consistency; the Phantom of the Opera didn't turn on Christine until she'd pulled his mask off ..By the way, if Guy Fawkes had succeeded in blowing up the King and Parliament, probably that would've meant the end of England as an entity and then maybe no America, so maybe the Americans who've made this a box-office hit should do some pondering on the ramifications of violence. Did that trainload of fertilizer at the end remind anyone (other than myself) of the late unlamented Timothy McVeigh? If you want to 'do something,' go check out Michael Moore's website, for instance. Don't blow stuff (or people) up; ain't good karma, methinks....",Null,1,3,23 March 2006
