Hereditary," Does the job. Better than most. One of the scariest movies ever.
","This film is incredibly well done and holds your interest all the way through. I found myself telling my date and myself that it is not real because I did not want her disturbed and thinking I was a weirdo for liking it. The family element is painful but realistic, the plot twists and turns, arriving at a grandiose place that could have been more fleshed out (figuratively, of course, the film gets shockingly graphic). That could have led to a longer play time to an already 2 hour movie. But Wolff's portrayal of the son character really wows in the film's second half, and Collette is basically Oscar-worthy, as unlikely as that eventuality playing out may be. Byrne grounds the insanity, providing levity in a movie that actually has plenty of it. I agree with Argento comparisons as the film gets crazy in true horror fashion, but the good script and the stellar acting makes the violence and thrills that much better and more disturbing. I would watch this again, I recommend you take a fellow weirdo. I'd also like a second look at the fantastical places the plot goes because by the end you are half in shock by this piece of art. And when you think about it, most of the violence is scarcely worse than primetime TV. The cinematography and execution make it unforgettable (tlock).",9,18,36,15 June 2018
