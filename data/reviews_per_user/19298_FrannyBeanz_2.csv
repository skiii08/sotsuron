The Hangover," Funniest Movie I've Ever Seen. Period.
","This is absolutely, without a doubt, the funniest movie I've ever seen. I can officially say that Apatow better watch his back, because Todd Philips just set the bar VERY high. My best friend and I were literally in pain from laughing so hard! In a nutshell, Doug is the groom-to-be. He and his 3 best friends decide to have one last, big 'guys night out' in Sin City before Doug heads to the altar in 2 days. But the plans go horribly (and hilariously) awry! The guys wake up to a completely trashed hotel room to find that Doug is missing, there's a crying baby in the closet, a chicken wandering aimlessly around the room, Mike Tyson's tiger is hanging out in the bathroom, and none of them can remember a thing from the night before. They must retrace their steps and figure out where they went and what they did the previous night in order to find their friend in time for his wedding the next day. I won't give away too much more, but seriously, this film is an absolute must-see. The cast is amazing, the cameo by Mike Tyson is side-split-tingly funny (you'll never listen to 'In the Air Tonight' by Phil Collins the same way again, I promise) and I guarantee that the first words out of your mouth when you leave the theater will be, 'We GOTTA see this again!'... I know mine were! I give this movie 10/10 because I've never laughed so consistently and so hard in a theater before. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie ASAP. You won't regret it!!

American History X," Nothing Short of a Masterpiece
","It would be an insult to call this a 'movie'. It is a MASTERPIECE. I first saw this in my senior year of high school, and I literally sat in stunned silence well into the end credits. By the time this film is finished, you've been taken on an emotional roller-coaster and you feel like you've been punched in the gut. I know I did. Edward Norton turns in another amazing performance as the reformed skin-head who tries to prevent his younger brother from following in his footsteps. It's the story of how Derek (Norton) goes to prison for killing 2 black guys who he catches trying to break into his car. His younger brother, Danny (Furlong) witnesses the whole thing. Prison changes Derek's perspective on life dramatically, and upon his release from jail, finds out that Danny is coming dangerously close to mimicking Derek's dangerous neo-nazi ways. In order to explain to a confused Danny why he is so different now, he tells him about his horrible and traumatizing experience in jail, which we are shown through flashbacks. Some people argue that the ending was predictable... call me naive, but I did NOT see it coming, and I was left, literally, with my jaw on the floor. This movie will stay with you, and it may even change you. Ed Norton was robbed of the Best Actor Oscar. This movie belongs in everyone's collection. It's something you won't soon forget.",10,0,3,17 August 2010
