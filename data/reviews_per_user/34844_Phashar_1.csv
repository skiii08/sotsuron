Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Special effects great, film a complete disaster
","As usual, the sequel of a great series of films miserably failed to impress me: I admit that the special effects are marvellous and very convincing, but apart from that, nah, forget about the film, it's a waste of great actors like Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson and Liam Neeson. The dialogues vary between bad soap-opera quality and unbelievably dumb, and the Gungan, the flap-eared creature that should be funny just gets on your nerves. Let's hope the next one will be a lot better.",2,0,1,24 October 1999
