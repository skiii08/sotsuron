It," It kind of feels that having more options, got in the way of being a better more scary story.
","I loved the TV-Movie, and the main reason I loved it, was because Pennywise was an awkwardly-realistic party-clown, any clown during that decade was very similar, and therefor a risk(if you were 12 like me).
The new movie of 'It' has a much higher production-value, BUT....the 'stylistic' choices really make the events less likely to really happen, so much so, that I'm a little too far removed from what should make this movie, awkwardly realistic.",7,0,0,24 November 2019
Jack Reacher," The story has great potential, but..... the casting just doesn't click.
","This is very much a movie that balances between good, and wrong(note, not good/bad, because everything is done really well in these movies, the problem with the movie is that they made the WRONG choices).
I actually watched this movie before reading the books, and as I watched it, there was 1-thing that gnawed at me, Tom Cruise... is too short as Jack Reacher. And after reading the books, realizing that Jack Reacher is 6'05/250lbs(which is roughly my size, so I very much get the mindset), I appreciate the writing more(because even in the movie, I felt that Jack was too short as Tom Cruise(he acted like a giant, while being... Tom Cruise-size), without any hints, or suggestion to expose it).But that's kind of the problem with this movie, and the next one, Tom Cruise is great as Ethan Hawke(MI), but he's not Jack, and he can't be, his physicality simply isn't the same(and in the books, Jack's size is a big part of his behavior), oddly enough there's 1 actor that is almost perfect to play Jack(Adam Copeland, also known as Edge-Rated-R from the WWE) he's physically perfect, and his natural personality is almost identical to Jack Reacher's(in Haven his Dwight was closer to Jack Reacher, than Tom Cruise was in Jack Reacher, and in Interrogation(a WWE movie) his character is almost 100% Jack).",7,1,2,18 February 2020
Annihilation," Not quite a movie yet.
","This is a movie that has 2 sides, on the one hand you have an excellent cast, that creates some great moments, you have some very pretty camera-work/FX, but on the other hand this movie really, really struggles to link those moments together, and make it a coherent story, it really struggles.",6,1,2,4 December 2019
