Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," puzzling indeed.....
","Before I decided to see this today, I was actually in a bit of turmoil, because I had been hearing a lot of negative things about this movie. That Johnny Depp (and every cast member for that matter) gave a poor performance, that the humor was lacking, and the whole darn thing just stale.......it wasn't until I realized that all the people trashing it had also trashed 2 and 3 that I decided to go see it and ignore what I was hearing. And I have to say, I was right to listen to myself.Long story short for anyone who is on the fence....if you like the Pirates trilogy, then this movie is for you. Johnny Depp was fantastic yet again, and brings Jack Sparrow to life as no other actor could. The rest of the cast was excellent as well, and while Im generally not a big fan of Geoffry Rush, I have to say this one was in all likelihood his best performance in the series to date. Ian McShane did at times come off as a bit flat, but overall did a nice job of portraying a villain that I think is just different from what the series has had to date. If you ask me, I don't think Blackbeard was meant to be this highly explosive emotional source of pure evil that the series has seen in the past.....I kinda felt like they were going more for an evil character who is just flat out cold......cold and uncaring to the core.The rest is as you would expect from this series. The humor was exactly in line with what the series has seen to date, and there was probably more action then you might expect as well. The Camera was a little off at times, but hell, if the Bourne Ultimatum can have the ridiculous camera work that it had and still be as great as it was, I see no reason why that should keep you from seeing this movie. If you were not so fond of the other Pirates films however......don't hold your breath, because this is more of the same.",9,0,1,22 May 2011
