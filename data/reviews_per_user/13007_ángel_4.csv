The Blair Witch Project," a film without poetry & feelings
",OK  the boys show us that they can make a film &  disguise in a very good way a documentary. But the plot and the film emptiness tell me another thing. This film is empty because  the brain of this boys is empty too. They are the 90s Kings of minimalism cinema. Never wanted say anything about how they see the world. They are cowards looking for witches and without a little sense of poetry. I would prefer that the Blair Witches would take the cameras.,Null,1,1,8 November 1999
The Fifth Element," super green
","Well, Luc, you know, the director, got something heavy in his mind. You can see the monsters or Gary Oldman or even the plot. Including the super-beautiful photography. But this film is something like a part of my family. I love Mila Jvovich clothes and the transatlantic. La Diva Plavalaguna's pretty, really. Maybe the wrong thing in this film is that it wants to conquer north americans. That's a wrong desire. Luc should play it only for [we] the aliens.",Null,4,6,15 January 1999
The Truman Show," God is a T.V. producer
","The beginning (first 30 minutes) is excellent. Then appears something like a very silly philosophy. God is a T.V. producer. Of course, in The Truman Show is good one. Although that can guide you to dude of His production. First good film for Carey.",7,0,0,15 January 1999
The Thin Red Line," the best
","Such a simple thing like that this film is the best of the past year, can not be accepted since it is not a common movie. I've seen Elizabeth or Shakespeare in Love, and I didn't find the powerful and keen strength of The thin... You got to remember films like Apocalypse now or Ivan Childhood (a movie by Andrei Tarkovski) to make comparisons. The tragic blindness of the war is something that move profoundly this film, but not with the Oliver Stone's tricks or the Steven Spielberg's rhetoric. The thin... is both ironic and poetic.",9,0,0,14 June 1999
