Resident Evil: Afterlife," Computer-Generated Pile of Mess in Slow Motion
","I'll be short and to the point. The title of this review pretty much sums up this rubbish. I've watched and liked previous Resident Evils but this one isn't like them. That's not because of numerous plot holes or bad scripting but simply because of such terrible, god awful directing. I will be short and to the point. This film is at no point scary, funny or dramatic - this is mostly due to overuse of 3D effects and overuse of high speed camera. Dogs are extremely obvious 3D animations. For a lot of people this is enough of a reason to skip this mess. There's nothing worse than a 'scary monster' that looks awkward rather than scary.A rule of thumb is if you can't do CG right don't do it at all. Already at 300 milliseconds of seeing those dogs one realizes they're fake. Even actors are often CG. There were movies where actual actors and animals have been 3D rendered and you couldn't tell a difference, this one is not such movie. Add a constant and excruciating use of slow motion effect to that and you get a very awkward looking scene where you're basically forced to nit pick details because of sheer boredom. I loved the role of dogs in previous movies, they were truly terrifying because they felt real and natural... no need for slow-mo-3D fiesta.The whole atmosphere feels fake too. At no point is there an illusion that any of this is real. It feels more like a bad commercial that you can't wait to end. Put it simply, it's boring and an insult to your senses.As for the town burning even after 5 years, bad guys wearing glasses inside, Milla surviving at impossible odds - it's part of the series and kind of intentional. However, a perfectly trimmed beard? This Resident Evil brings a metroxeual male supermodel as its main protagonist now right next to Milla.",3,2,5,16 December 2013
