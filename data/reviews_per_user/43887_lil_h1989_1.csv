The Longest Yard," great football movie!
","This was an awesome movie!! I'm 15, and my friends and I went to see this movie. The whole place was laughing the whole time! Definitely go see this movie. The jokes are funny, and Chris Rock cracks some great jokes. Sandler is good, but I like him in his other football movie, The Waterboy, better. I gave it 10 out of 10 stars. Some of the jokes may be a bit too mature, but I even saw kids younger than me in the theater (one of my brother's younger brothers went and he's 11). It's your call, but definitely see this movie! Great football movie and lots of good cameo appearances! It's cool to see Michael Irvin hit people again too!",10,3,10,26 May 2005
