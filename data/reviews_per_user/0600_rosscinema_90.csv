Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Second part is more dialogue driven but still quite impressive
","**SPOILERS**This second part of Tarantino's film ties up all the loose ends that were left after the first part ended last year and both parts are very different. Both have fight scenes and flavorful dialogue but in the first part the emphasis was on action while this is more dialogue driven. Part two has The Bride (Uma Thurman) now identified by name as Beatrix Kiddo killing the last two assassins from the Deadly Vipers Squad and then heading to kill Bill (David Carradine). Budd (Michael Madsen) is Bill's brother and he manages to shoot Kiddo with rock salt and then tranquilizes her so that he can bury her alive in a coffin. He calls Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and wants one million dollars for her and they agree but Kiddo manages to escape and goes to seek revenge.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Elle arrives and gives Budd his money but she has tricked him with a black mamba which kills him but then Kiddo bursts in and she and Elle are involved in a brutal fight. Kiddo wins and now she is off to find Bill and kill him but in one of the flashback sequences we see Bill bringing her to Master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) who spends the next year or so learning martial arts. Kiddo finds Bill and before she kills him she discovers that he has the daughter that she was pregnant with! Kiddo finally meets her daughter B.B. (Perla Haney-Jardine) but later she and Bill have their ultimate showdown.Quentin Tarantino opens this film in black and white but it does eventually move on to color and like the first part their is an abundance of music clips from both television shows like 'Ironside' and films. This part has a noticable Italian Western tone to it and Ennio Morricone's score from 'The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly' is played during a key scene. While the first part had at least 4 big fight scenes in it this part really has one and it's a wonderful spectacle between Thurman and Hannah. Otherwise this has just a sprinkling of action elements like Thurman being buried by Madsen and the training by Liu. Who would have guessed that the best fight scene in a movie this year would be between two women? Both Hannah and Thurman should be given as much praise as possible for their achievement and both of these talented actresses show they can play any role given to them. I can't wait until both parts are available on one special edition DVD and it will be interesting to view both parts in one day. Also in this cast is Samuel L. Jackson as Rufus the organ player and an unrecognizable Bo Svenson as the Reverend. Perennial 'B' movie actor Sid Haig pops up as a bartender as well. Tarantino has masterfully created a story that is a loving homage to the martial arts films that he so dearly idolizes and this film is dazzling both in it's choreographed action and in the way it's photographed by cinematographer Robert Richardson. Both Thurman and Carradine give unflinching performances and what aids them is Tarantino's wonderful trademark dialogue that not only adds flavor to the action but gives their character's their soul.",8,1,2,30 April 2004
Miracle," Faithful retelling of sports history
","Being that I'm from Minnesota and was about 18 years old when the USA beat the Russian team to advance in the Olympics this film has a special place in my heart. The story is about coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) who applies for the job to coach the Olympic Hockey Team and much to his surprise he is hired. During the first day of trials Brooks has a roster of players that he is sure about using much to the chagrin of the rest of the Olympic committee that wanted to have a hand in selecting the players. Brooks gets Craig Patrick (Noah Emmerich) for his assistant and he wants him to be more friendly and supportive to the players since he knows that as a head coach his job is to be harsher. *****SPOILER ALERT*****The players that are selected are all talented but relatively unknown but Brooks doesn't want the best players, he wants the best for his team. He spends long hours and many days trying to whip his team into shape in preparation for the Olympics but it puts a strain on his marriage to his wife Patty (Patricia Clarkson). Finally when they reach the Olympics the American team has grown more confidence and they have realized that they must work as a team if they have any chance of defeating the seemingly invincible Russians. This film is directed by Gavin O'Connor who does an admirable job of recreating the mood and events of 1980 and one of the things that I noticed was the way the characters spoke and acted. Characters in films today (And in real life) seem to talk with a lot of attitude and display a lack of respect for others. That is not the case in this film and the script is careful to make sure that these actors capture the spirit of the times. The script also makes sure that the film is focused on Herb Brooks more than the players on his team. It would have been so easy to write a back story on each character but instead the film relies on showing what made them an effective team. Russell's portrayal of Brooks is extremely accurate and downplayed exactly the way the real Brooks was. Russell has always been an underrated actor but the studios know he's a dependable star and he's well cast here. One of the best things that this film does is remind us of what an incredible sports feat this was and it shows the sacrifices and pain these men went through in order to accomplish it. There's nothing fancy about this story and it is an old fashioned spirit lifting film but for those who remember the events that this is based on it's a film that is a lot of fun to relive over again.",7,0,0,28 February 2004
Catch Me If You Can," Very good film has those Spielberg edges!
","At first I thought I was going to see a lightweight film from a great director but instead I watched another impressive achievement by Steven Spielberg. A few things stand out and of course the performances are terrific. Leonardo Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in 'A League of Their Own' and his mere presence adds more to this film. The sign of a great film star. And Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances in his already interesting career. The last scene of him as he talks to his son in the restaurant is so moving that it reflects on the great talent of Walken. You can understand why Dicaprio admires and loves his father. Walken conveys these emotions and makes the audience react just accurately. I'll be rooting for him at Oscar time. Another impressive thing about this film is the beautiful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who's a real artist with a camera and has worked on several Spielberg films. One shot in particular stands out. The ray of sunshine coming in through the kitchen window on Walken. Very thought provoking. And of course since its a Spielberg film its very personal. Spielberg was interested in the Frank Abagnale character because as a youngster he also came from a broken family and wanted to be someone else. Spielberg would sneak onto the studios and tell people that he worked there. Also, the real Frank Abagnale jr. appears as a French police officer. Well made, extremely well acted and sharply written. Viewers seem to forget that this is really a film about the breaking up of a family and the aftermath. This really is a personal film from Spielberg, and a very good one.",7,186,211,18 March 2003
The Ring," Fairly good remake but endless
","I was impressed by the original Japanese version 'Ringu' and that film was more tidy in it's storytelling but the same cannot be said about this remake. Story is about a video tape that when watched the telephone rings and the viewer has seven days to live. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a reporter and when her niece dies under suspicious circumstances she investigates and hears the story about the tape. Her son Aidan (David Dorfman) has been drawing strange pictures that end up being part of the mystery. Her investigation leads to a cabin where the viewing of the tape took place and she takes it back with her so that her ex-husband Noah (Martin Henderson) who works with video equipment can check it out.
*****SPOILER ALERT*****Aidan views the tape and now Rachel must hurry to find out the source of the curse and she and Noah head to a ranch where a woman named Anna Morgan (Shannon Cochran) use to breed horses but she meets  her husband Richard (Brian Cox) who seems hostile. More investigating leads them back to the cabin and they discover a well under the floor where they think Anna's dead daughter may lie.This film was directed by Gore Verbinski who is a very talented director and he would end up making 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. This is a very good looking film that keeps a dark and hazy atmosphere throughout and I don't recall one scene that has sunshine in it. Every shot that takes place outdoors is either rainy or overcast and it helps create an eerie mood to the film. I enjoyed the pacing of the film and it keeps your interest throughout although there are a few changes in the script from the Japanese version to make it more Americanized. The one problem I had with this film was that it didn't seem to want to end and there were probably three different times that it could have. It just seemed to go on and on and I have to admit that I can't really explain everything I watched in this film. It is a complicated story and to it's credit this film never ventures into typical Hollywood cliche's but I wish this could have been wrapped up better. I do recommend this film and Watts once again proves she's a solid actress but the script sure could have been tightened up. The original is definitely better but this isn't a bad effort.",6,0,0,26 January 2004
Minority Report," Great effects, but what about the story?
","One of the biggest gripes I have toward this film is that it's suppose to be set in the year 2054! Thats not that far away! And the futuristic gadgetry is totally unbelievable for 50 years in the future. Why not just set it like 100 or 200 years in the future? And as much as I admired the set designs and special effects, it's really just a more expensive version of 'Logans Run'. There really are no surprises in the story. In fact, we've all seen this plot before. Lots of times! I did enjoy Samantha Morton as Agatha. She's a wonderful actress. The cameos are fun and so are all the references to Kubrick and 'A Clockwork Orange'. Technically superior, but they definitely needed to spend more time on plot and story.",6,0,1,14 July 2002
Finding Neverland," Depp hits just the right tone in Neverland
","While not entirely accurate in it's depiction this film does shed some light on how the story Peter Pan was conceived and it's accomplished by another performance by one of our more versatile actors. Story is set in 1903 London where we watch playwright J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) suffering through the failure of his new play but one day while walking in the park he meets a widow and her 4 boys. Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet) is having a hard time keeping her boys under control but Barrie is immediately amused by they're fun and games and he's also attracted to her as well. Barrie starts spending more and more time with them and it doesn't sit right with his wife Mary (Radha Mitchell) or Sylvia's mother Emma (Julie Christie) who wants to run the household with more stability.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Barrie and the boys play assorted games such as cowboys and Indians and pirates and while all this goes on he continues to write in his journal until he gets the idea for Peter Pan. Unfortunately for Barrie, his wife Mary leaves him and Sylvia contracts an illness which will one day claim her life but before she passes on Barrie makes sure that she gets to see the play that her children helped inspire.This film is directed by Marc Forster (Monster's Ball) who continues to show that he's one of the more talented directors to come on the scene in years. The script does take some liberties with the facts and it condenses it down to fit the story that Forster wants to tell but it's done well and he's assembled a terrific cast. Depp is arguably the most versatile actor working today and even though the script doesn't really explain the characters inner most thoughts the performance that Depp gives is still engaging. I did feel the film was trying to manipulate it's audience with the death of Sylvia but it seems to redeem it's reasoning with the scene of Barrie bringing the play to the household. The script could really have benefited more with a more concise story of why Barrie never really wanted to grow up and the only scene that tries to do this is the one where he talks of the death of his brother. With that, we still get a sense of believing that Barrie would be inspired by the Davies family and Depp once again shines in an entertaining role. As good as Depp is, young Freddie Highmore who plays Peter is terrific and the scene at the end of the film as he talks of still being able to see his mother is haunting. Even with the sentimental angle the script takes this film still accomplishes what it sets out to do and it does so through a talented director and a top notch cast.",7,0,0,13 December 2004
Friday Night Lights," Berg's film shines with authenticity
","Just like 'Ladder 49' this film is careful not to stray from it's roots and go overboard and instead remains focused on presenting itself in a completely realistic manner. Story is based on true events in 1988 where in Odessa, Texas the Permian Panthers are under pressure to win the state championship. In a small place like Odessa the areas events are centered around high school football and the ultimate glory is to win 'State' and Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) is looked at very closely and if he cannot deliver a championship team his job will more than likely be in jeopardy. *****SPOILER ALERT*****The young quarterback for the Panthers is Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) who lives with his unstable mother and he knows if he can show everyone how good he is it can lead to a scholarship to a good college and out of Odessa. Also on the team is Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) who has more natural talent than anyone but he loves to talk a lot and showoff and during the first game of the season he suffers a bad knee injury that puts his career in doubt. But the player that is really under pressure is Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) who is constantly being criticized by his father (Tim McGraw) to the point where he is actually slapped while on the field.This is the third film that actor Peter Berg has directed and it's easily his most impressive and it looks as if he has a genuine career in directing. Berg has been getting better and better with every effort and not only does he stay true to the story without aiming for the extreme but this is a film that's visually interesting to look at. I've heard some call this the 'Black Hawk Down' of football films and that's not a bad comparison because the look of this film is very reminiscent of something Ridley Scott could have made. The performances are also on the mark and Thornton gives us a coach that is one of the more intricate and human than we usually see in films. While Thornton really doesn't have one big showy scene in the whole film there is one moment that sticks with me and it's the scene where he knows he's being lied to by Boobie and his uncle when asked if he can play. They of course say yes but Thornton's eyes tell us that he knows whats going on but for the life of him he can't say so. Under Berg's direction this film doesn't try to be something other than a straight forward look at high school football and each of the characters are realistically portrayed to the point where we actually recognize some of them from our own lives. Some will say that this is 'The' football film ever made and considering how carefully well made this is by Berg they might actually be right.",7,0,1,17 October 2004
Monster," Riveting performance by Theron
",***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** We have all seen serial killer films before and they usually have the lead actor come across as some unbelievable psychopath but this is a film that takes the rare approach of showing us the person who became a killer. It doesn't make any excuses for her actions but it does take an extremely honest and realistic view of a woman who did become a monster. Story is about Aileen Wournos (Charlize Theron) who is a Florida prostitute and down to her last five bucks when she stumbles into a gay bar. While sitting there she meets Selby Wall (Christina Ricci) who is an 18 year old lesbian clumsily looking for someone to talk to. After a nervous start the two of them hit it off but Selby is scheduled to go back to Ohio in a few days so Aileen tries to convince her to stay. Aileen walks the interstate and picks up johns and one night she is parked in the woods with a man who beats her viciously and ties her up. He assaults her with a tire iron until she manages to get free where she finds his pistol in the front seat and kills him with it. She disposes of the body and takes his money and car and when she shows Selby the amount of cash she has and the car this convinces her to stay with Aileen. They rent a rundown house where they live together and after failing to find a normal job Aileen goes back to hooking. Aileen prides herself as the bread winner and in order to keep her and Selby together she ends up murdering many other men.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Aileen ends up murdering seven different men and she tells Selby only about the first one which was in self defense. Aileen hates being a hooker and one night she and her friend Thomas (Bruce Dern) both tell each other how life doesn't give you any choices but you do what you have to do in order to survive. One day Selby crashes the car where an elderly couple gets a good look at them and when the police finally figure out that it must be a prostitute committing the murders a composite drawing of the two of them is shown on television and this leads to Aileen's capture.This film was directed by Patty Jenkins who is making her directorial debut and she does a good job of just allowing the film to focus in on Theron's portrayal. This film doesn't do anything special or stylistic and that's a good thing because it doesn't need to. It shows us a character that really never had much of a chance in life and we do understand her anger and confusion at the world. After a nightmare of a childhood she becomes this pitiful person who is useless to society. The performance of Theron is one that will be talked about for many years to come and its done with an incredible amount of understanding for the characters anger. Not for a second did Theron lose focus as Aileen and she stays in character every moment in the film. I have heard a lot of talk about the make-up that Theron wears for the film and while it is an amazing job her performance is not based from this. Theron's body movement is a big part of the film with the unsteady walk to the wild glare in her dark eyes. The dark eyes that she bares to the screen in certain scenes are ones that show a lifetime of hurt and pain. I was truly mesmerized by the stares of anger and this has nothing to do with make-up. It's a gut wrenching performance that is easily the best of the year and Theron finally has received the role that proves herself as a wonderful actress. Even though Ricci's character could have been written with more depth I still thought she was excellent as the naive lover of Aileen. She plays a person that has been told what to do all of her life and the one time that she decides to think for herself is to help the police incriminate her lover. This film takes an honest look at a sordid character and while its approach is sometimes pedestrian it makes the right decision to allow the actors to pick up the slack. In this case it's a performance of stunningly raw emotion.,7,0,0,18 January 2004
The Rookie," Well made and likable
","Dennis Quaid is well cast as Jim Morris in this true story of an older guy who tries out for the major leagues after coaching his high school to a division title. Quaid is totally believable in the role and that's where the heart of this film lies. The wrong actor would have sunk this film but Quaid has always been so physically fit that he can portray this aging 'wanna be ballplayer' and his natural charm makes you root for him all the more. I've always thought that Quaid was an underrated actor and he seems to be getting better as he gets a little older. The story is old fashioned and at times sappy but I think that would be nit-picking. Although I do have one major gripe, Rachel Griffiths is a major actress but her role here as Quaid's wife is a throw away. She really doesn't have any effective scenes and her role is reduced to being the supportive wife. In essence, any actress could have played the part. If your making a film with Rachel Griffiths you had better give her something interesting to do! But I did enjoy the film and I liked the way the director John Lee Hancock took his time telling the story. The pacing is good and its also very well photographed. Its not a great film but how can you knock a movie that has so much heart? I couldn't, and I sat back and bought into it and enjoyed myself!",7,0,1,27 October 2002
Underworld," Looks good but lacks convincing story
","A film about a war between werewolves and vampires and the leading character is a sexy female in leather? Can't go wrong can it? Well, while this can be interpreted as silly fun I still had to many problems with the story and it's lead actress. Story is of course about how there is a war on Earth (I think) between werewolves and vampires and this has been going on for many centuries. Kate Beckinsale is Selene who is a leather clad female vampire and she spends most of her time hunting down werewolves that hide inconspicuously in the human world. A young man named Michael (Scott Speedman) gets bitten by a werewolf named Lucian (Michael Sheen) and Selene notices that he was picked for a certain reason. Selene does some investigating and discovers that the werewolves are trying to mutate their species into a hybrid so that they can eliminate all vampires.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Selene takes the information back to her vampire brood but the vampire in charge Kraven (Shane Brolly) ignores her and has been acting suspiciously. The leader of their group is Viktor (Bill Nighy) who has been sleeping for many years and is not scheduled to awaken for many more but Selene does awaken him to seek help from Kraven's lack of support. Meanwhile, Michael is slowly turning into a werewolf or something like it but he and Selene have an attraction to each other. This film is directed by Len Wiseman who is making his debut here as a director and he has been primarily known as a set decorator for films like 'Stargate'. The look of this film is it's biggest asset and he gives this film a very effective gothic appeal. Every frame is shot either in doors or at night so there is no sunshine visible at all. The costumes and make-up also are some of the films highlights and Speedman's transformation is reminiscent of 'An American Werewolf in London'. Some of the problems I had with this story is the lack of information about where or when this is supposedly taking place. Is it on Earth or one of those so called alternative universes? Also, this is the first time I have ever seen werewolves able to crawl on the sides of walls like squirrels on trees. Selene is a vampire but in one scene she looks at herself in a mirror. Is she only partially a vampire? We never find out and there are other inconsistencies in this cartoonish script. While Beckinsale is adequate in the lead role I had to ask myself if the film could have benefited from another actress known for her physical attributes like Angelina Jolie or Halle Berry. I think it could and Beckinsale's lack of conviction hurts her in this role although I do understand her wanting to show the public another side of her abilities. This film is harmless and I can't argue with anyone that finds it entertaining on a comic book level but I do wish the story has been tightened up a bit and allowed the characters to engage in something resembling an intelligent conversation. Visually striking but film fails to entertain me on both levels.",4,1,5,7 February 2004
Two for the Money," Pacino doing his thing in entertaining film
","We have all seen films where certain actor's just seem to shamelessly chew up their scenes with gusto but let's face it, it would be hard to imagine other films if they didn't. I think this is one of those films because without Al Pacino doing what he does best this would probably come off as tedious at best. Story is about an ex-football player named Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey) who has suffered a career ending injury and ends up working for $10 an hour at a 1-900 telephone service where he gives football picks to listeners.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Brandon is so good at this that eventually he gets a phone call from Walter Abrams (Pacino) who runs a sports betting service in New York City where clients spend thousands and even millions of dollars. Walter is very successful and married to Toni (Rene Russo) and together they raise their young daughter but he's also a recovering gambling addict with a serious heart condition. Walter brings Brandon to the East Coast and shows him how to be a ruthless prognosticator and when Brandon proves to be a complete success with his football picks he actually gets a co-anchor position on Walter's cable access show. Things eventually start to go downhill when Brandon's picks start going sour and clients start losing all of their money but things really get bad when Walter starts gambling again and also suspects that Brandon and his wife are having an affair.This is directed by D.J. Caruso (Taking Lives) who has shown to be a competent filmmaker and here he's made a pretty good looking film that makes good use of it's New York City locations. The film's story doesn't offer anything revolutionary in terms of surprises but the main theme of people betting large amounts of cash is something that I have always found intriguing. McConaughey is a capable actor and here he's well cast as an ex-jock who is easily drawn into the gambling circles and from the perspective of the audience it's believable to watch his character get so taken in. Pacino is the key to this film not only because of his star power but for the simple fact that he's the real life force that makes this effort so entertaining to watch. His character has been described by many as reminiscent of his role in 'The Devil's Advocate' and it would be hard to argue it but being one of the best actors in the world he still gives this character enough unique tics to make sure it is clearly different. Sure, Pacino is over the top but can anyone really imagine this film without him? Dan Gilroy's script doesn't offer anything that hasn't been done better before (1974's The Gambler is a good example) but the cast is good and Pacino once again shows audiences that he's still a force to be reckoned with.",7,0,2,20 October 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Depp adds needed ingredient
","This easily could have been your run of the mill pirate movie but thank god Johnny Depp is not only a terrific actor but one that adds real 'Character' to his characters. Film starts out with a young boy found adrift at sea with a gold medallion around his neck and an old ship which looks like a ghost ship is spotted. Years later the boy Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is working with a blacksmith and in love with Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and she is the daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce) who would rather see his daughter marry Cmdr. Norrington (Jack Davenport). One day at port a strange sailor shows up as his small vessel sinks and he is found out to be pirate Jack Sparrow (Depp). They want to hang him but that night the town is attacked by pirates headed by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Jack has a personal beef with him. Seems as though Jack was the Captain of the ship Black Pearl but the crew performed a mutiny and left Jack on a deserted island which he escaped from. Two of the pirates grab Elizabeth because she has Will's medallion and while questioning her she says her last name is Turner. She discovers during her kidnapping that the pirates are really the walking dead and in the moonlight they appear as rotted cadavers. They think she is related to 'Boot Strap' Turner who was a pirate that they killed and they need the blood of his offspring to become human again. Jack and Will steal a ship and go to recruit sailors so they can save Elizabeth and Jack can reap the rewards as well. This film is directed by Gore Verbinski and along with 'Mouse Hunt' he demonstrates a real flare for lavish sets and decorum. The sets are terrific here and the special effects are pretty good as well, especially some of the underwater shots looking up at the bottom of the ships. The big problem with this film (Besides being too long) is the script. How many times did Depp get captured by either side and then have to talk his way out? And the romance between Bloom and Knightley is just so cliche. Knightley is particularly dreary. She's a fresh pretty young face but in this film her role could have been performed by any other actress and it would have been the same. She showed much more spark and left an indelible mark in the film 'Bend It Like Beckham'. Here, she's just a forgettable pretty face. What saves this film is Depp and Rush. Thankfully these two remarkable actors add so much imagination to their roles and they give the film the added flavor it badly needed. Can you imagine this film without them? Depp has stated that he played his role in the nature of a drunken Keith Richards and with the eyeliner he wears its a joy to watch him. Rush also does a good job and with that monkey on his back he seems to be having a good time. Some of the other pirates are played on a comedic level and one that stands out is the pirate with a glass eye. The film doesn't take itself seriously and this attitude works to its advantage. This film came very close to being very routine but with the performances of Depp and Rush they together save it from being predictable and stale.",6,2,6,3 August 2003
The Notebook," Sentimental love story works because of it's actors
",I bash Hollywood all the time as they continually churn out formula films over and over again but every once in a while they make a sweet love story that for some reason or another works well. This clearly works and I think it's due to the performances of it's actors that obviously had good faith in the material. Story starts out in a nursing home where we see Noah 'Duke' Calhoun (James Garner) who everyday reads to his wife Allie (Gena Rowlands) from his notebook about the story of how they met and fell in love. Allie is suffering from Alzheimer's and doesn't know that the story that is being read to her is actually her life but Duke hopes that it will start a spark where she will briefly remember their great romance.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Duke reads their story as it starts in the 1940's in North Carolina when as a young man (Ryan Gosling) he works in the saw mill but one night he meets a very pretty rich girl (Rachel McAdams) and begs her to go out with him. She does and they start dating until they both eventually fall head over heels in love but Allie's mother Anne (Joan Allen) wants her daughter to end her romance as she deems him lower class. Allie goes to school and doesn't hear from Noah but then the war breaks out and it takes a few years before they meet up again. By this time she's engaged but with their meeting they restart their torrid romance and must now ponder whether to get married or stay for good with Noah.This film is directed by Nick Cassavetes who is slowly learning how to be as terrific a director that his father was and with each film project he seems to be choosing material that is vastly different from each other. Here he tackles a sweet and sentimental love story and he does the right thing by staying close to the novel by Nicholas Sparks and assembling a great cast with his own mother in a pivotal role. Garner hasn't been in a role this good in eons and he's nothing short of moving here and I think this is the first time that he's actually cried in a performance. I was also deeply impressed by McAdams who I feel is a real emerging star and I do hope other well written roles come her way because she shows that she's ready. This film takes it's time telling it's story and it does tend to wander at certain points but this is a genuinely sweet and romantic film that is made with real care by it's young director and it's acted extremely well by the talented cast.,7,3,6,30 November 2004
The Girl Next Door," Risky Business ripoff
","I really wasn't bothered by the ad campaign from the studio trying to pass this off as just another teen comedy with elements of porn in it because I think any subject matter can be made into a good film with the right people but what I hate are clueless opportunists that make films for no other reason than to ripoff ticket buyers. Story is about 18 year old Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) who is getting ready to graduate from high school and has no real life except his studies until he notices his new next door neighbor. After an awkward situation where Matthew watches his neighbor from his bedroom window he finally meets Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) and they start to spend time together where they develop a real relationship until he discovers what her real profession is.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Matthew finds out that Danielle is a porn actress and when he wants to let her know that he still likes her he suddenly meets her former boyfriend/producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) who wants her to come back to making films. Things get complicated when Kelly steals $25,000 that was for a foreign exchange student but with the help from his two best friends (Chris Marquette & Paul Dano) Matthew makes a business deal with a porn king named Hugo Posh (James Remar) where they can raise money making a sex education video for high schoolers.This film is directed by Luke Greenfield who is making only his second attempt at being at the helm of a film with the first being the Rob Schneider comedy 'The Animal' and as silly as that is it looks like a masterpiece compared to this idiotic nonsense. A complete blatant ripoff of 'Risky Business' but without the visual skill and intelligent script that helped make that film a mini classic. There are so many things that are taken from the Tom Cruise film that it would be impossible to list them all but I can point out two with the first being actor Olyphant being the 'Guido the Killer Pimp' character. The second is the music with the background score being eerily like Tangerine Dream and at one point the hit Muddy Waters song 'Hootchie Cootchie Man' is played and that was very prominent in the 1983 film. Hirsch is supposed to be 18 years old but he's able to walk into strip joints and porn conventions without ever being asked for ID and practically every adult character is portrayed as innocuous to everything going on around them. With the exception of a few quick shots this film doesn't even have the gumption to have much nudity in it and it's one of the most tame teen sex comedies I've ever seen and I watched the unrated version! Hard to imagine this film has a cleaner version, what would be the point? Every second that Hirsch's character is on screen I kept expecting him to put on some sunglasses and say 'What the F***' because the screenplay for this is totally devoid of any type of originality. From being funny and intelligent to some sort of exploitation fare this film fails on every level and doesn't seem to have the nerve to try something creative. Avoid at all costs!",2,1,4,5 December 2004
Spider-Man 2," Extremely well made and poignantly written
",This is a rare film in that I think it's clearly better than the first film which is also very good but it's also rare that a superhero story could be so well written and even thought provoking at times! Story picks up after the first film where we see Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) struggling to keep jobs and maintain grades at college and pay the rent and its because of the fact that being Spiderman keeps him very busy. He's still madly in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) who's become an actress and he's still best friends with Harry Osborn (James Franco) who blames Spiderman for the death of his father and Harry is also irked that Peter claims to be friends with his enemy. One day Peter notices his powers dwindling and after making everyone angry for always being late he decides to stop being Spiderman and concentrate on having a normal life!*****SPOILER ALERT*****Peter meets a brilliant scientist named Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) who is working on physics and fusion and develops something with metal arms that attaches to his spine but something goes horribly wrong and Otto becomes Doc Ock where his mind changes for the worse and he wants to continue his work that may bring New York City to ruins. Peter decides to become Spiderman again and in fighting Doc Ock he learns how valuable he is as a superhero and eventually both Harry and Mary Jane learn of his true identity.This film is once again directed by the visual master Sam Raimi and while this is chock full of CGI effects the one thing that makes this sequel so special is the sensitive script and dialogue. Raimi does a wonderful job of juggling and balancing both the action and the characterizations that have become so vital to the story. Peter has become so disillusioned with being Spiderman that he finds it impossible to have a life and a relationship. I cannot tell you how many scenes there are with Peter talking to various other characters about his troubles and depression without revealing the truth behind them and these scenes for me are the strongest points in the film. Maguire brings real humanity to his role and he handles it with a lot of sensitivity that can make even the harshest of film critics identify with. The action scenes are exciting and they do help balance out the story but the thought provoking dialogue that is spoken by the actors are what's so special here. Raimi directed a film called 'A Simple Plan' a few years ago and that was also well acted and written so maybe we shouldn't be surprised when he directs another effort that shares those same splendid attributes,8,0,1,2 August 2004
Finding Nemo," An animation classic
","Pixar has created something quite special with this film and I do believe that this deserves to be mention with the best of them although 'Pinocchio' is still the king. Story takes place on a coral reef in the ocean off of Sidney, Australia where we find a clown fish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) who is always worrying about his son Nemo (Alexander Gould) because he was born with one extra small fin. One day Marlin's worries come true when Nemo is captured by scuba divers and taken away in a boat. Marlin tries to find his son by following the trail of bubbles but they quickly disappear and now he must find another way. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Marlin meets Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who is a female and blue and also suffers from short term memory loss but she tags along with Marlin to help find his son. Meanwhile, Nemo has landed in a fish tank in a dentist office and he meets Gill (Willem Dafoe) who is a scarred gill fish and he has elaborate plans of escaping the tank and making it to a drain which leads to the ocean. Marlin and Dory while on their trek encounter sharks, poisonous jelly fish, sea turtles, and get swallowed by a whale but manage to escape through the blow hole. They get to the harbor by Sidney and with the help from a pelican they get to the office and see Nemo!This film is co-directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich and Stanton has become a very important director for Pixar. Three things stand out from this film for me and the first is the story that Stanton wrote himself. The journey that Marlin and Dory take to find Nemo is seemingly impossible but with the creative story it does manage to happen and it's a lot of fun to watch. Secondly, rarely has a voice in animated features stood out but what DeGeneres accomplishes here is nothing short of memorable. Her voice not only possesses humor but it also makes the audience feel sorrow and pity for Dory and she gives this animated character a new dimension. How can anyone not laugh when she talks whale and all it's dialects? Thirdly and not the least is the jaw dropping animation that is created for this film and the intricate details that take place are nothing short of brilliant. From the school of swerving jelly fish to the slow emergence of the whale from the darkness this film gives animation a depth and dimension that I'm not sure we have seen before, at least not like this! This is a rare visual delight that belongs to be mentioned with the other classic animated features.",9,1,3,7 June 2004
Alexander," Disjointed Stone epic
","I'm not convinced that audiences were really expecting to view a film based completely on historic fact but I do think that they were awaiting something that had more clarity and conviction. The film starts out in 323 B.C. and the death of Alexander (Colin Farrell) as told by old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) who is dictating his experiences with the former king. Alexander was raised by his snake charmer mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie) and his brutish father Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer) although Olympias insists on telling him that his real father is Zeus.*****SPOILER ALERT*****After Philip is murdered Alexander becomes the new King of Macedonia and starts his crusades of conquering other countries which leads him to proclaiming Babylon as his new home. He talks of uniting the races and even marries a Persian princess named Roxane (Rosario Dawson) which not only conflicts with his mother's wishes but with his Army as well. Alexander has a male lover in Hephaistion (Jared Leto) who accompanies him everywhere from the battle with the Persians at Guagamela to almost being killed in India. It's the battle in India that convinces Alexander to bring his Army home but by this time they have become divided in terms of loyalty and when back in Babylon his enemies await for the opportunity to poison him.Oliver Stone has once again given us a hugely ambitious project that he obviously has a deep passion for and shows once again that he's fascinated by people in great power. But to be honest, this may be his biggest disappointment to date with his personal views overshadowing the performances of his cast. Farrell is one of the most exciting young actors to come on the scene in years but as far as being Alexander would anyone really follow him into battle? The actor that's arguably wasted the most is Dawson who is so incredibly sexy and strong that you had to wonder why there wasn't more scenes of her and Farrell together. Another area that this fails in is Alexander's sexual relationship with Hephaistion which only consists of Farrell and Leto eying each other with the occasional hug thrown in. The film does better in the battle sequences and the final conflict in India is shot with sharp red tones by Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto. Even though Hopkins is the narrator his mumblings and ramblings don't add any real perspective to Alexander and it also fails to give any reasoning for his thoughts or actions. One can't just dismiss a film like this considering the credentials that Stone carries but he never seemed to get a grasp on the internal motives of this character. This is a disjointed film but it's one that again proves (to me anyway) that Stone is one of our more interesting auteurs.",5,3,6,11 December 2004
Constantine," Ridiculous film should have stayed a comic book
",As movie viewers are plagued every year with comic book stories being turned into films it shouldn't come as a surprise that the efforts are becoming more and more pathetic and desperate. This film is arguably the worst and it's one of those projects that clearly wasn't made for the purpose of entertainment and instead it's churned out by studios for a reason to try and make money. Story is about a demon fighter named John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) who chain smokes and coughs up blood because of lung cancer but he also starts to notice that the demons he is combating are trying to cross the line from Hell to the living on Earth.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Police detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) goes to Constantine for help after her twin sister supposedly jumped to her death but she believes that there is something else going on and needs help investigating it. Constantine explains that there are half breeds living on earth and that a good balance is needed to keep them in line but with a half demon named Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale) and the treacherous angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) looming around Constantine's instincts turn out to be true after the Spear of Destiny is found.This film is directed by Francis Lawrence who has never made a film before and has only directed music videos which would account for the look of the film. If you saw the trailer than your not going to be surprised by anything this film delivers except how ridiculous this really is. About every 10 or 15 minutes Reeves has to explain what he's doing and how he's going to do it and you start to think that he's making it up as he goes along. I can't describe just how much religious/supernatural mumbo jumbo that takes place here and if the story wasn't silly enough the dialog is also a joke. When Constantine is talking to Gabriel about trying to end up in heaven viewers are treated to some real pearls of wisdom as Gabriel looks at him and utters 'your f****d!'. Reeves is not a bad actor but he seems truly uninspired and if anyone can show me the difference between his performance here and his performance in the Matrix films than I welcome the feedback because it seems to be the same one note effort. Peter Stormare is a wonderful character actor but his Satan comes across as anything but daunting as he wears a white suit and has a thick lisp like Tennessee Williams. I never read the comic book 'Hellblazer' that this is (supposedly) based on but it has to come across better than this CGI laden film. If the thought of Reeves pulling out brass knuckles and punching a demon trying to cross over intrigues you than maybe you'll be entertained by this. But for more discernible film viewers this is a nightmare come true and represents the very worst of Hollywood.,3,21,44,27 February 2005
Troy," Unspectacular 'Troy'
","I thought I was going to truly hate this film but after viewing it and thinking about it for a day I realized that while it has nothing to make it special it's not that bad on a purely entertainment level. This is of course based (Loosely) on Homer's 'The Iliad' and early on we see the Trojan forces on a peace mission in Sparta where Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) discovers that his wife Helen (Diane Kruger) has fled with Paris (Orlando Bloom) to Troy. Paris is warned by his brother Hector (Eric Bana) that this will probably start a war but he insists that they are in love. Menelaus's brother Agamemnon of Mycenae (Brian Cox) views this as the perfect opportunity to wage war and take over Troy but his best warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt) is very independent and doesn't hold back his lack of respect for him.
*****SPOILER ALERT*****The united Greek forces head to Troy to wage war but Priam (Peter O'Toole) and his army are ready at the walls and score a victory as they momentarily repel Agamemnon's army. At night Hector leads the Trojan army on an assault while they are sleeping and Hector kills who he believes is Achilles but it turns out to be his cousin instead. Achilles finds out and is furious and heads to the gate to fight Hector one on one. Achilles wins and later the Greeks have an idea on penetrating the walls of Troy by building the Trojan horse and sneaking inside.This film is directed by Wolfgang Petersen who is one of those directors that can easily handle an epic film of this size but the screenplay that accompanies this story doesn't do it any justice. The dialogue is just unbelievable and it crosses the border into silliness and Kruger especially is forced to utter some modern dialogue. Does her Helen come across as someone you would go to war over? Audiences have become totally accustomed to CGI effects and films such as this are just not special looking and the lack of characterizations and tedious dialogue stick out even more. Pitt has been getting a lot of negative feedback for his role as Achilles and I can't argue that he's probably miscast but at the same time I think he makes this film watchable. Pitt is one of the biggest stars in the world and a solid actor and even in a misguided film such as this his incredible screen persona is evident. Let's face it, you can't take your eyes off of him even though this film lasts over two and a half hours. From the battle scenes to the musical score this is a film that screams 'I want to be another Gladiator'! Unfortunately, it's not but this is a mildly entertaining sword flick that is no worse than some of the old Hollywood films of the past.",5,2,4,31 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Irwin Allen must still be alive and working!
","I grew up during the seventies when all those disaster flicks came out and with the exception of a few of them they were all pretty cheesy and silly. Now thirty years later we can all rest assured that Hollywood is still making silly and unbelievable disaster films. This story starts out with a respected Climatologist named Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who along with his cohorts in the Antarctica discover that the climate of the earth is about to change and that another Ice Age is about to happen! No sooner than you can open an umbrella there are tornadoes ripping apart Los Angeles and Europe is covered with 15 feet of snow. Jack's teenage son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in New York City with his friends from school when a gigantic tidal wave puts the whole city underwater. Then the cold front comes in and everything starts to freeze but Sam is told by his father to stay put in the library because he is coming to get him.*****SPOILER ALERT*****A small group stays in the library while the rest of the country freezes and Jack decides to drive and then walk to New York to find his son. While in the library they burn books to keep warm but they need to get medicine and food to stay alive and while all of this is going on there is a mass exodus to Mexico where it is warmer.This film is directed by Roland Emmerich who has directed other big budget blockbusters and unfortunately for him the pattern seems to be the same. He's quite adept at handling the scenes with special effects and action but when it comes to the characters he's at best clumsy. The effects are the star of the film and it's due to the fact that the characters are all badly written. Emmerich uses as many cliches as he can in this story such as Sela Ward staying back with the sick child in the hospital. You have to wonder why it took Gyllenhaal and his pals so long to finally go out and search for food and medicine and we also get scenes with characters arguing about which books should be burned and which ones to save. I didn't hate this film and it's mainly because of the attraction of watching Los Angeles get torn apart by tornadoes but lets face it, this is a very silly and badly written film. I'll go on record right now and say that 'The Poseidon Adventure' is a much better film. Emmerich can handle action scenes as well as anyone in Hollywood but when it comes to dialogue for characters he should definitely let someone else write the script.",4,0,2,13 June 2004
Hotel Rwanda," Devastating film with a powerful performance by Cheadle
","This true story shows audiences both the best and worst of the human race as we see a man use every bit of his wits and tact to save 1,200 lives while the rest of the world turned it's back and ignored the atrocities that were taking place. Story is set in 1994 in Kigali, Rwanda where death squads are formed by the Hutu's after their leader is murdered and they engage in genocide against the Tutsi tribe. The manager of the Hotel Des Milles Collines is Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who is a Hutu but his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) is a Tutsi and she and the lives of their children are threatened so they take refuge at the hotel.*****SPOILER ALERT***** The hotel chain is Belgian owned and many Tutsi refugees end up coming there until the count reaches about 1,200 but the Hutu armies start to come around to find them. There is a United Nations presence led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) who does his best to protect them and try to get them out but his hands are tied as his orders are strict in that he cannot get involved with trying to maintain peace. Paul talks to Generals and death squad leaders and uses bribery, lies, and tact to keep everyone alive until the United Nations can get them out but the roads are blocked and supplies have run out.This is only Terry George's second effort as a director and with this powerful film he has clearly shown everyone that he is a director to watch from now on. The strength of this film comes from different sources but along with the true facts that this is based on the performance of Cheadle is one that is extremely crucial to the story. Cheadle gives us a character that even amid horrible circumstances (and even his own safety) he uses his clear thinking and controlled nature to keep not only the hotel running but to keep everyone alive. In a powerful scene Cheadle changes his clothes and attempts to tie his tie but with everything that he's witnessed he finally breaks down but the key is that it happens when he's alone. After he emerges from changing he proceeds to run the hotel as any manager would and I believe this moment in the film sums up what the character is about. George has made an important film that people should view just so that the genocide that took place will never be forgotten and it also marks a career defining role for the versatile Cheadle who after giving audiences many good performances in previous efforts shows that he is indeed a very special actor.",8,1,1,30 January 2005
Crash," Intrigueing look at racism in Los Angeles
","What this film does that others haven't in the past is have the subject of racism brought to the forefront from the perspective of all the characters and how small things that occur can have a major impact even with those who are not directly involved. Story is about how several characters living in the Los Angeles area deal with racism and how it effects their lives and everyone around them including a black cop named Graham (Don Cheadle) who is sleeping with his female partner Ria (Jennifer Esposito) but has no idea of which Latin descent she's from.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Other characters involve a district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his wife (Sandra Bullock) and how they deal with being carjacked from two black men (Ludacris & Larenz Tate) who have their own perspective of things. A white racist cop named Ryan (Matt Dillon) harasses a black couple (Terrence Howard & Thandie Newton) while his disgusted partner Hanson (Ryan Phillippe) looks on and an Iranian store owner has his business looted and blames the Hispanic locksmith.This is made by Paul Haggis (Million Dollar Baby) who makes his directorial debut with this effort and not only does his script cover all the bases but his attention to detail is at times overwhelming. In my perfect film world this would be considered the normal attempt in making a film but instead audiences are used to wading through about 10 or so bad films before finally viewing something thought provoking such as this. As much as I respected this film I still came away thinking that it was flawed in some manner and I think what hurts this is that there is just too many characters and events being tossed at the viewer. Even so, Haggis's effort deserves praise not only in what he's trying to achieve but by pushing the right buttons and provoking the audience with a subject that (let's face it) makes everyone uncomfortable. Haggis has emerged as a true talent and an important artist and he seems to be one of those writer/directors who even if he fails he'll still create something that's worth everyone's time.",8,0,6,16 May 2005
Closer," Scathing look at two couples
","This is one of those films that will undoubtedly make casual viewers feel uncomfortable and I think the reason for that is that the script depicts it's characters baring they're basic self in a manner that isn't contrived. Story takes place in London where we first see an obituary writer named Dan (Jude Law) meet a young and pretty American girl named Alice (Natalie Portman) who's a stripper from New York and they end up having a relationship that inspires him to write a book. While Dan is getting his picture taken he starts to flirt with the photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) who is attracted to him but she meets Alice who instantly notices the attraction between them.*****SPOILER ALERT*****After living together for a year Dan tells Alice that he has been having an affair with Anna and that they are breaking up. Meanwhile, Anna explains the same thing to her husband Larry (Clive Owen) who forces her to tell him their intimate details in an explosive confrontation. Things get complicated over the next few years as Larry finds Alice working in some strip joint and keeps wanting her to tell the truth about who she really is and Anna who stuns Dan by getting back with her husband. Larry tells him that he should get back with Alice because she really loves him but before he leaves he tells Dan that he also slept with her.This film is directed by the great Mike Nichols who has tread on material like this before with 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' and 'Carnal Knowledge' but the script here by Patrick Marber is definitely a darker look at relationships. Marber's script is from his play and like other character studies this film is chock full of brutal honesty in the dialog. The actors are up to the task and while some may think Roberts is slightly miscast I found her more than holding her own and reminding us that she should be considered for more than just romantic comedies. While Law is on screen for the majority of the time (and is very good) the performances that standout come from Owen and Portman. Owen's character not only has a dark side but is always within a word or two of being verbally abusive which is in contrast to what critics usually say about him. As an actor, Owen has been called anything from brooding to complacent but here he's nothing short of explosive and it's a performance that should raise some eyebrows. Over the past few years Portman has matured as an actress right before our eyes and this role should forever keep anyone from considering her in anything but adult parts. She's a revelation here and Portman displays so many layers to her character that when we find out the secret at the end of the film we feel overcome as we remember some of the previous scenes. This is a dark and angry film about four characters that like to boast about being honest but the one thing that they don't boast about is they're own selfishness when it comes to relationships. It would be easy to dismiss this film because the characters are so unlikable but for me this is the type of film that should be considered the norm. With strong performances and the unabashed portrait of self loathing this is a film that doesn't care what others think and dares you to take a look.",8,4,7,12 December 2004
Elf," This will play on television every year for the rest of our lives
","This is a good natured holiday comedy that definitely is in the same realm as 'The Santa Clause' and (Dare I say?) 'Miracle on 34th Street'. Story is about a human that has been raised by Santa's elves at the North Pole and as he gets older he figures out that he's very different from the other elves. Years earlier Santa (Ed Asner) was delivering at an orphanage and a human baby accidentally crawled into his sack and was taken back to the North Pole where he was raised by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). He is called Buddy (Will Ferrell) and he grows to six foot three and one day he is told the truth about his situation and told by Santa who his real father is. Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and he heads to the Empire State Building where he works. He finds his father Walter (James Caan) who runs a publishing business and works all the time much to the chagrin of his family. Walter is unable to get away from Buddy and after a blood test proves he is his son he takes him home with him to stay with his family. He meets Walter's wife Emily (Mary Steenburgen) and their son and Walter thinks Buddy is just someone reverting to his childhood after a shock. Buddy starts to work in a department store and he meets a woman named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) and is smitten by her. Buddy tries to fit in with the others but finds it difficult although he becomes friends with Walter's son and starts dating Jovie.This film is directed by Jon Favreau who has made his mark as a director of low budget films like 'Made' and also as a character actor but this is his first effort at directing a mainstream Hollywood movie. He does a commendable job and as I watched this film I kept having the feeling that he purposely made the most commercial film that he could. Favreau as an actor has mostly appeared in small roles. As a director his small films are lucky to play at art house theaters and I seriously doubt he's getting rich hosting 'Dinner For 5' on the Independent Film Channel. It looks as though he wanted to make a crowd pleasing film that will ultimately be playing on some cable channel for the rest of our lives. I'm not knocking this decision at all, it's a smart move and he's become a major Hollywood player with the success of this film. Even the script was carefully written to insure that WHEN this plays on television there will be nothing to edit out. The closest thing to a bad word is uttered by Caan when he says 'Hell' once towards the end of the film. This is a fun film that does have undeniable charm and its heart is definitely in the right place. It's sentimental and corny but thats part of the appeal. The script doesn't try to hard and the energy and flow of the film keeps at a constant pace, it doesn't try to go over the top which is refreshing. Ferrell is a natural performer and his dopey wide eyed expressions never grow old. This film must be doing something right because tough guy James Caan is believable as a caring husband and father. Very old fashioned story that never raises itself above lightweight status is nonetheless funny and charming. Like I said earlier, this film will be playing on television every year for the rest of our lives!",6,81,119,22 December 2003
Capote," The events that left Capote a shattered man
","Unlike other efforts that described themselves as being biographies I think a better way of looking at this film would be as a haunting remembrance and a synopses of events that would forever change a man. This certainly isn't about the life of someone but instead is about the most important time in the life of one of the most talented writers this country ever produced. Story starts out in 1959 where writer Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) notices a news article about a Kansas family being murdered and persuades the editor of The New Yorker to allow him to do a series of articles on the effects it has on the residents. Truman brings his childhood friend and fellow writer Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) to Kansas with him to help out with the research and while they interview some of the locals the police arrest the two killers.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Perry Smith (Clifton James Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) eventually confess to the murders and it's at this point when Truman decides that he will write his next book on the events. The local officials allow Truman to visit both of these men but it's Perry that he becomes friendliest with and eventually it grows to be an attraction. Truman does use his charm to get vital information for his book but eventually it dawns on him that after 6 years of appeals the only way he will be able to finish it is when they both are finally executed by the state.This is directed by Bennett Miller who's only other film was the documentary 'The Cruise' and one can't help but be impressed with his direction but of course it helps to have a special actor like Hoffman in the starring role. This film does belong to Hoffman and his performance can easily be described as riveting especially during the scenes when he talks about himself growing up as different and one gets a good sense of why he became such a charmer. One of the more interesting things that the film lets on is that Harper Lee actually helped Truman gain information for his book 'In Cold Blood' while still working on 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and in fact, her book was published and made into a film while he still waited for the appeals to end. The 6 years that Truman worked on 'In Cold Blood' was the time that changed him forever to the point that he never wrote another novel again and this film does a splendid job of making sure that audiences understand that this man was so disturbed by his own behavior that he never forgave himself. This isn't really a biography but the film does a remarkable job of capturing the time and events that led to Truman questioning his own humanity. Miller is certainly a director to watch but it's Hoffman who once again demonstrates that he's one of our finest actors working today as he provides one of the year's best performances.",8,1,3,24 October 2005
Lost in Translation," This film translates extremely well
","This is the second film directed by Sofia Coppola and she has proved  to be a director of enormous skill and passion. Story is about a famous American actor named Bob Harris (Bill Murray) who has come to Tokyo, Japan to make a whiskey commercial for a lot of money but he hates himself for it. He is staying at a posh Japanese hotel and having a difficult time getting any sleep because of the jetlag. His wife from home sends him carpet samples Fed-Ex and when they speak on the telephone they skirt the issues of their marriage woes. Also staying at the hotel is Charlotte (Scarlet Johansson) who is married to John (Giovanni Ribisi) and he's a photographer on assignment. Charlotte has come with him to Tokyo but he leaves for extended amounts of time and Charlotte has nothing to do but ponder the troubles in her two year old marriage. Charlotte and Bob bump into one another from time to time and even share a drink but finally Charlotte asks him if he wants to go out someplace else besides the hotel bar. He agrees and they go to meet some friends of hers and they hang out at karaoke bars and finally seem to be comfortable. For the next few days they share meals and watch television and even fall asleep but they don't get intimate though, they're relationship is more about companionship and being comfortable with each other while they both discuss they're marriage woes. Sofia Coppola's first film was the dreamlike 'The Virgin Suicides' and in that effort she created some incredible atmosphere which she does here to some extent also. Both films have a slow and deliberate pace and while some may find that to be a glaring fault I thought otherwise. This is a film about two lonely people in a foreign city that have found each other and together they seem to function better by being able to talk to one another since neither can communicate well with they're spouse. The film is enhanced tremendously by the two performances of Murray and Johansson. Murray has slowly developed into a very good actor and his maturity was evident in the comedy 'Rushmore' which was also a very good performance. Coppola likes to have the camera linger on her characters and this allows a natural performer like Murray to excel and in those scenes where the camera stays on him we get those trademark 'Murray-isms'. This may be his defining performance that people will always point at but I have a feeling that we'll be seeing other terrific performances from him in the future. This also is a breakthrough role for Johansson who has been solid in smaller roles in her career. As good as she was in 'Ghost World' this is her biggest role to date and she's up to the task. She displays both maturity and poise in a role that could have been played in a one note effort but she shows more layers to Charlotte than we would expect. Its a solid performance that should open a lot of eyes from people who are not familiar with her. I'm not convinced that this is a great film and one of the reasons is that with Coppola's style of filming it at times leaves the characters emotionally distant and its hard to embrace these characters at times. But this is a minor gripe because this is a very good film with two exceptional performances. Coppola has once again directed a film with a very unique visual style and she really has emerged as one of the more interesting directors.",8,0,0,2 November 2003
"Monsters, Inc."," Fun for all ages
","This is another enjoyable animated feature from the Pixar studios and one of the reasons they can entertain a more older audience is the subtle references that they make from other sources. The story is about a world called Monstropolis where monsters live and their world is powered by the heat of childrens screams. Monsters go through doors that lead into the closets of children in the real world and its the monsters job to frighten children so that their scream can be harnessed and used for power. The top scream collector is Sulley (John Goodman) who is a big hairy monster and he works in the factory that builds the doors and where collectors are to pass through. Sulleys best friend is a big walking eyeball named Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and they discover that a human child named Mary and nicknamed Boo (Mary Gibbs) has passed through into Monstropolis and together they try and get her back but the alert has gone out and the monsters of Monstropolis think that humans are toxic and can kill you. Its always fun to watch these films and its because the computer animation that Pixar does is so detailed and intricate. Each hair on Sulley seems to have a life of its own. The stories are engaging as well as they seem to be about simple things that we can all relate to. Monsters waiting in the closet, we have all grown up thinking about these things and its fun to watch these old phobias come to life. One of the subtle references I was talking about is where Mike is eating in a restaurant called 'Harryhausens'. This is of course in reference to the great Ray Harryhausen who is a pioneer in special effects for films. This film also has the Oscar winning song 'If I Didn't Have You' by Randy Newman and he has become a Pixar staple with his music. Very enjoyable animated feature that has more to offer than just a kids flick. Adults will definitely get a kick out of it as well!",7,0,1,6 July 2003
The Aviator," Scorsese's energetic biopic reminds audiences of the mystique of Hughes
","It's quite natural to remember Howard Hughes as the old recluse who suffered from his own demons and eccentricities but this film instead shines on the man during his most important years where he often over shadowed the most prominent of movie stars. The film starts out in the later part of the 1920's where Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) is smack in the middle of making 'Hell's Angels' with Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani) and continues with his activities as one of the most important pioneers in aviation.*****SPOILER ALERT***** From 1927 through 1947 we watch Hughes as a playboy dating some of the most recognizable actresses including Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), and Faith Domergue (Kelli Garner) and it's his relationship with Hepburn that was one of his most passionate. Hughes was the top shareholder for TWA and controlled it but Pan Am president Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) wants to buy it but Hughes keeps refusing his offers which leads to Trippe getting Sen. Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) threatening Hughes with an investigation and attempting to ruin his future business deals. Hughes also breaks several speed records with aircraft that he's designed and even through surviving plane crashes he still builds and flies the Hercules (aka Spruce Goose) which is the largest airplane ever built. While all this goes on Hughes deals with his own personal demons that would eventually get the better of him from constantly washing his hands to being paranoid and getting stuck on certain words and phrases.Martin Scorsese once again splendidly recreates a certain point in time and here it's Hollywood during the 20 years when Hughes was at his most industrious. There are two ways that old Hollywood can be recreated today and the first would be in black and white but cinematographer Robert Richardson gives us the other alternative with beautiful colors. Some of the shots in the film range from the colorful interiors to the soft haze of certain close-ups that is reminiscent of photo's of old Hollywood stars. The performances are exceptional and Blanchett should be given special praise for the ungodly task of recreating the spirit of Hepburn. I've heard many comment that DiCaprio doesn't exactly embody Hughes and I agree but I look at his performance the same way that I see this film. Not only does DiCaprio capture the drive and nerve of the man but he also gives the audience a reason to be interested in his accomplishments and failures. As a director Scorsese sets the bar pretty high even for himself and while this isn't exactly as riveting as 'Raging Bull' this is still a superb accomplishment in terms of film-making and one that is a marvel to watch.",8,2,4,31 December 2004
The Italian Job," Unrelenting action!
","This is your basic remake of an old caper film and while it has nothing new to offer as far as the plot is concerned, the action sequences are thrilling to watch. The story is about an older thief named John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) who is in Venice with his gang and they steal 35 million dollars in gold bars but when they are in the Alps they are ambushed by a bunch of armed men headed by Steve (Edward Norton) who is in their gang as well. John is killed and Steve takes off with the bars. A year later Charlie (Mark Wahlberg) gets the gang together again and have tracked Steve down in Los Angeles. The gang consists of Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), Left Ear (Mos Def), Lyle (Seth Green) and they also enlist Johns daughter Stella (Charlize Theron) who is an expert safe cracker. They elaborate a scheme to steal back the gold bars and the action never lets up. Sounds like a very familiar story and it is but director F. Gary Gray does a very wise thing with this material. Its loaded with car and boat chases with helicopters and the way they steal the gold bars is actually pretty creative. The action never really ceases much so the film never becomes boring. Forget about logic, this is one of those summer films that you can just sit back and enjoy. Its nowhere near being a great film like Michael Mann's 'Thief', but it is a little better than 'Swordfish' minus a beautiful actress getting topless. Edward Norton has stated that he only did this film out of a contractual agreement but he does seem to be having fun playing a real bad guy. His character Steve is your cliche' backstabber but he is enjoyable to watch. Seth Green has the funniest moments in the film as Lyle who insists that he is the original Napster and doesn't generate much respect from his fellow gang members. If you go and see this film you can expect the same story you have seen many times before but the characters are engaging and the theft itself of the gold bars is done in a very exciting manner. Sit back and have fun!",6,2,3,23 June 2003
Radio," Feel good film is straight from the hip
","This is one of those films that can act as a test for viewers who want their cynicism rated because while it would be easy to dismiss this as sappy it's still a film that for the most part avoids contrivances. Story is set in Anderson, S.C. in the 1970's where we see James Kennedy (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who is mentally disabled and spends his days pushing a cart around and collecting junk. Harold Jones (Ed Harris) is the local high school football coach and he meets the young man after some of his players lock him in a shed and scare him badly. Coach Jones helps him and gains his trust but after asking his name all he can get out of him is 'Radio' which becomes his nickname.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Radio acts as the team cheerleader and as an assistant and he slowly starts to open up as Coach Jones attempts to teach him things in his classroom. Radio's mother (S. Epatha Merkerson) isn't sure why Coach Jones is so friendly to her son and not everyone in town agrees with it either but as Radio accompanies the high school team to games he becomes a permanent fixture on the sidelines which people start to appreciate.This is directed by Michael Tollin who has directed only one other film before and here he does an admirable job of making sure that viewers don't witness another story in which someone of special attention beats racism in a small town. The script really just shows how Radio opened up as a person when those around him started to treat him fairly although there is that part of the story where the important town banker (and father of the star player) attempts to change things. If anything, the film lacks any real drama which can be looked at as both a flaw and as something refreshing but I think the film is just trying to stay faithful to it's source. The casting helps to iron out the sentimental elements and with those crooked choppers Gooding smartly makes sure that his performance doesn't stray over the top. Harris is his usual pillar of strength although his real intentions are never clear despite his little speech about being a kid with a paper route. This film can be looked at as both a hit and a miss but I do think that there are enough good things happening with it to warrant a viewing so that others can find out where they stand in terms of their own cynicism.",5,0,0,2 February 2005
The Village," Despite ending this is still a pretty good mystery
","I know I'm not alone when I say that I knew what the ending was going to be but I still couldn't forget how well made this film was leading up to something fairly predictable. I hope future viewers will ignore what the others are saying about this and judge it for themselves and see that it's an effective mystery. Story is about a village that is deep in the woods where the inhabitants raise livestock and farm and live by a set of common rules which includes that no one ever sets foot in the woods surrounding their village. They have a truce with the creatures that live in the forest where they both respect each others borders but the people still have round the clock watches in towers just in case the alarm is needed. The village is run by Edward Walker (William Hurt) who keeps things running by consulting with the elders on issues at hand. Edward's daughter is Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) who is blind but still very strong willed and she is in love with Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) who petitions for a chance to venture into the woods.*****SPOILER ALERT*****The village idiot named Noah (Adrien Brody) is also in love with Ivy and he stabs Lucius badly which leaves him on deaths door and desperately needing medicine to combat the infection he has acquired. Ivy tells her father Edward that she will go get the medicine from the town but first he confides in her about the secret of the creatures.
M. Night Shyamalan directed this and shows his usual gifts as a storyteller such as well written characters, deliberate pacing, and of course the twist ending and while I understand that many did not care for this I am still recommending it because everything leading up to the ending is very well done. One of the best things about Shyamalan's films is the taut editing that keeps viewers guessing and occasionally jumping out of their seats and this is no different. The editing reminds me a lot of how Clint Eastwood edits his films in that every scene is significant and every shot has meaning which is why his films are still fun to watch a second and third time. Howard as Ivy gives an inspired performance and their were times when some of the lines of dialogue she recites sounds a lot like poetry especially when talking about seeing the world in her own way. I do admit that I knew what kind of ending was coming up and it's no fun to figure something like that out but I was intrigued when one of the creatures pops up later in the film. Also, one can't dismiss Hurt's character sending his blind daughter into the woods when he probably could have gone himself. This is a glaringly strange moment in the story that I think hurts the film and with the ending I can understand the viewers frustration. This is not one of Shyamalan's best efforts but it's still a good mystery and like 'Signs' it possesses some truly eerie and nerve wracking moments.",6,0,0,22 August 2004
Cold Mountain," Supporting roles save film
","Even though this is one of the better looking films of the year its still a disappointment when you think of the main part of the story that involves the two main roles. Story is about a man named Inman (Jude Law) that lives in a small southern town called Cold Mountain and the Civil War is only days away from starting. Inman meets Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) who is the daughter of Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) and once they lock eyes a flirtatious relationship begins. The two of them say almost nothing to each other but after war is declared and Inman is putting on his uniform he kisses Ada before he marches off. While at the front lines the Yankee Army dig tunnels and plant explosives underneath the Confederates and this is the start of a very bloody battle where countless lives are lost on both sides. Inman is wounded and while recovering in a makeshift medical facility he decides that he doesn't care about 'The Cause' and deserts from the Army and plans on walking back to Cold Mountain and to Ada.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Back at Cold Mountain the Reverend Monroe dies and leaves Ada alone on the farm to tend for herself which she is not equipped to do. A local man named Teague (Ray Winstone) has his eyes on Ada's property and Ada herself and along with his band of thugs they execute Army deserters and torture and kill anyone that aids them. One of Ada's neighbors decides to get her help so one day the rough and tumble Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) shows up and she helps her take care of the farm. During they're time together Ada and Ruby develop a strong friendship even though they appear to be total opposites. Ada keeps telling her that Inman will return one day even though she hasn't heard from him in years. While on the road Inman meets several people that either help him or try to arrest him and kill him. He meets a lecherous preacher named Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), A grinning hillbilly (Giovanni Ribisi) with a house of sirens, an old woman named Maddy (Eileen Atkins) who lives in the forest with goats, and a young widow (Natalie Portman) who has a sick baby but yearns for the touch of another kind person. Both Ada and Inman spend the next 3 years or so going through all sorts of turmoil until Inman finally makes it back to Cold Mountain where they are united.This film was directed by Anthony Minghella who makes films in the most beautiful locations. This film is suppose to be in the South but is actually filmed in the lush forests of Romania and even though some of the scenes don't look like the South the scenery is still rich and gives the film a unique and remote look. The battle scene that takes place in the first part of the film is as barbaric as it is impressive. When the explosion goes off we actually see soldiers getting their uniforms blown off. Its a scene that film historians will be discussing at great lengths and its probably the best reason to view this film. With that, this film does have a glaring flaw that is evident from the first 10 minutes. Kidman and Law are practically strangers when he goes off to war and the supposedly love angle just doesn't come off. I wasn't sure why Kidman's character even gave Inman a second look. She's educated and proper and he's...well, he mumbles with nails in his mouth. Both Law and Kidman come off as strong but dull. What saves the film (For me, anyway) are the supporting performances that are all vividly shown and Zellweger steals the entire film. It's not that her performance is believable but it is impossible to take your eyes off her when she's with Kidman who stands around looking like a deer caught in the headlights. Zellweger's Ruby is a cross between Annie Oakley and Pippi Longstocking and she chews the scenery with gusto. While the story definitely has its share of flaws its still quite impressive looking and I believe this film is more about the journey than what its suppose to lead to. Minghella has shown once again that he knows how to tell stories on an epic scale and this is a well crafted film from start to finish.",7,0,0,11 January 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," He's back!
","While not exactly up to the excellence of the first two films I do think this is a worthy sequel to this franchise. Story has John Conner (Nick Stahl) now in his 20's who is basically a drifter and he is still haunted by the events that took place a decade ago. One night in Beverly Hills a new terminator appears (Kristanna Loken) and it takes on the appearance of a beautiful woman and its mission is of course to find Conner. Conner is hiding out at a veterinarians office and early one morning Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) who works there comes to work and finds John. Turns out the two of them went to high school together and suddenly the terminator T-X shows up. Meanwhile, in the desert the older model of terminator appears (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his mission is to make sure John and Kate survive Judgement Day because their children will become important in the future. The old terminator saves them both and there is a very destructive car chase that involves police cars, fire trucks and a big crane. They go to a funeral home in the desert and find the coffin of Sarah Conner which is full of weapons. Kate's father is an Air Force officer named Robert Brewster (David Andrews) and he is in charge of a top secret program that involves this countries weapons system. Its the key to Judgement Day and the three of them race to his installation and try and stop the impending destruction. This film was directed by Jonathan Mostow who demonstrated in 'U-571' that he could handle a difficult assignment like this. Its not quite up to the first two films and one reason would be the special effects. T2 gave us effects that would change the way films would look. This one does not, but its not that these effects are bad. Their not! But at the same time they're not ground breaking. And Loken as the terminatrix just doesn't come across as we would expect. She is so beautiful and I found it symbolic that she entered our time by emerging out of a Beverly Hills shop window! Its symbolic because she has the look of a mannequin. T2 didn't make Robert Patrick a huge star and I doubt that this will for Loken either. But this still is a very exciting and entertaining film. One thing that this film did was to make sure Schwarzenegger act like a cyborg and not show human emotions. T2 had one glaring flaw in it that still makes me angry to this day. Its at the end of the film where he tells Edward Furlong 'I'm sorry'. Sorry? He's a cyborg! He doesn't feel emotions. And in this film that mistake does not happen, thank god. I was so relieved by that. The film sets up itself for another sequel and it does so with a dark ending that was more in line with the first film. It didn't come across to me as a silly and contrived ending that was only put in for money purposes. I think a continuation is essential and the ending is believable as far as this story is concerned. Arnold has his trademark 'One liners' throughout the film and in one humorous scene actor Earl Boen reprises his role as Dr. Peter Silberman and along with Schwarzenegger he is the only actor to appear in all three films. The first Terminator was a brutally dark and brilliant film and the second was a very interesting story with ground breaking special effects. This film is not up to those two but it is a worthy sequel that is never boring for one second. On a simple level, its just plain fun to watch Schwarzenegger in these films. One of the most indelible characters in movie history. Lets see T4!",7,0,0,20 July 2003
"I, Robot"," Unconvincing script and casting
",This is based on an Isaac Asimov story and from what I have heard Asimov would have been furious with this bad Hollywood rendition which serves nothing except to try and make money. Story takes place in 2035 Chicago where robots are used by most people as servants and workers and after the suspicious death of Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) who is the creator of robotics a Chicago cop thinks that it may be homicide. Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) hates robots and doesn't trust them which puts him at odds with his superiors but while investigating Dr. Lanning's lab he runs into a robot named Sonny who acts suspicious and tries to run off. Helping Spooner is Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) who works for the same company that makes robots and her job is to make them more human like although she appears to be very cold in nature.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Sonny is let go by the police but Spooner keeps investigating and discovers that a robot revolution is about to take place and it's masterminded by a robotic power source that functions like the main brain for all working robots. This film is directed by Alex Proyas who also made the incredibly underrated 'Dark City' and he does have a good vision as far as what these futuristic films should look like but the script is really nothing more than a bunch of action scenes set-up for Will Smith to act heroic. Although many will probably disagree with me I never thought Smith was credible playing a cop in any film and I base that on his persona as a loudmouth that talks a lot but doesn't listen. It's supposed to be 2035 and everyone has modern devices but Smith's character seems to have been plucked out of modern times and placed into the future. From his smart alecky street attitude to the goofy clothes he wears Smith is totally out of place in this science fiction film. I understand he's gold at the box office and shallow viewers expect him to play the same character in every film but he's just obnoxious and annoying here. At one point he barges into the home of Moynahan and pours himself a drink and plops down on a chair making himself at home which infuriates her and than asks her why she would get along with robots better than humans. After two minutes of watching his behavior and listening to his crappy attitude I think everyone would prefer the company of a robot over him! The dialogue is especially bad and twice during the film the phrase 'Your the dumbest of the dumb' is uttered. Isaac Asimov is a great writer and his stories are timeless but even though the potential for some truly classic films could be made they never will be as long as Hollywood keeps looking at them with dollar signs in their eyes and miscasting big name actors.,4,0,0,19 August 2004
The Battle of Algiers," This film attains a level of importance that has never been achieved before
",We all go to the movies because we love to be entertained and it's hard to argue that it's the greatest form of entertainment but when serious viewers talk about film in terms of being important you would have to expect this title to be instantly brought up. This film covers the years from 1954 to 1962 in Algeria when the Arab section of Algiers started an uprising to fight the French and gain their own independence. Ali La Pointe (Brahim Haggiag) is a petty thief and hustler and when he gets out of jail he teams up with El-hadi Jaffar (Saadi Yacef) and together they form the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) in which they start terrorist attacks.*****SPOILER ALERT***** French authorities bring in Col. Mathieu (Jean Martin) to head the anti-terrorist unit and he uses methods of torture to slowly eliminate the insurrectionists who hide behind walls in apartments in the Casbah. Eventually Col. Mathieu kills Ali and it seems that everything will go back to what they were but two years later the Arabs take to the streets in huge numbers which causes the U.N. to take notice and in 1962 Algeria finally gained it's independence.This was made by Italian filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo who shot this in the actual locations in Algeria and used mainly non-actors in his cast (Martin is the only professional) and the story is based on a book by Yacef who not only is a survivor of these true events but is cast in an important role. Pontecorvo has created a film that seems so real that he had to have a disclaimer put into the credits stating that no newsreel or documentary footage was used which is incredible because there are so many scenes in which it appears that real events were caught on film. The script does it's best to show both the positive and the negative of both sides of the French and the FLN but it does seem that Pontecorvo leans towards the side of the Arabs. This all takes place in a time when most American viewers were not aware of what terrorism was about and in 1965 it was probably easy to just point at the French and think they should just get out but now in our day and age audiences are a little more sophisticated to the world and it's politics. There are scenes that take place that we will probably never see done again because of the lack of safety especially the shots of the bombs exploding and the (so-called) actors scrambling for their lives. Another point in the film shows a French soldier bursting into an apartment to search it and accidentally stepping on a crying baby! There is no doubt that this is one of the most important films ever made not just because of the subject matter but in the skill that Pontecorvo applies to achieve his vision. In 1965 this may not have been perceived as a truly great film but now 40 years later it's looked at as one of the most important films ever made and one that is studied by military personnel and those in the Pentagon.,9,9,15,11 March 2005
Van Helsing," Outlandish, to say the least
","I grew up watching the Universal horror films and when I heard that they were making this I had the suspicion that I was going to be disappointed. I guess I'm from the old school where I prefer original make-up over CGI effects and many times during my viewing of this I thought I was watching a Warner Bros. cartoon. Story is about monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) who works for the Vatican and he is told that Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) is in Transylvania causing trouble but first though he goes to the Notre Dame cathedral and kills Mr. Hyde. Van Helsing takes an inventive Friar named Carl (David Wenham) along with him and when they arrive in Transylvania they are almost attacked by the local villagers but some flying vampiresses swoop down and he manages to kill one. He meets Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) who has been fighting Dracula and his brides as well and later Van Helsing learns that her brother Velkan (Will Kemp) is actually the Wolf Man. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Dracula has been searching for Frankenstein's Monster (Shuler Hensley) so that he can learn the secrets of creation and bring his own offspring to life. Along with the Wolf Man and his brides Dracula has Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) to help him and after Van Helsing and Anna find The Monster they set out to get him. Van Helsing gets bit by the Wolf Man and in two days the moon will be full so now they must hurry to stop Dracula's plans.This film is directed by Stephen Sommers who did the 'Mummy' films and while he genuinely brings tons of energy to his films there are just too many CGI effects for my taste. The whole film is so cartoonish and silly that it goes way over the top and there isn't a scary moment in the film. Jackman looks like he rummage through the wardrobe department from 'Indiana Jones' and found the right getup to wear and Beckinsale looks like a Victoria Secret model with her corset. Also, Beckinsale demonstrates so many flips that she would be a cinch to win a gold medal at the Olympics. Wenham as Carl is the comic relief and he has the best lines in the film like after the Wolf Man jumps out of a window he asks 'Why does it smell like wet dog'? And why do the werewolves in this film have the ability to crawl up walls like a lizard and be able to jump like a grasshopper? Dracula wants to bring his offspring to life but they are in cocoons. Why are they in cocoons and how does the living dead mate? Roxburgh as Dracula is especially hammy and along with Beckinsale you have to chuckle at the attempts at a Romanian accent. The part of the film about the Monster I found a little more interesting but he's so chatty! Frankenstein's Monster speaks better than most people today and he seems equipped to be an English teacher. The last 20 minutes of this film is so silly and drenched in CGI effects that it ceases to be a film and instead is more animated. The Monster and Beckinsale spend most of the last 20 minutes swinging on cables like Spiderman and Beckinsale's character is thrown and tossed like a rag doll and there is no way she could keep getting up. As old as the original films are they still have more impressive special effects and are genuinely scarier but if someone told me they liked this as just escapism and entertainment I wouldn't argue. But for me it's just utter nonsense and completely outlandish and over the top and I still recommend the old Universal horror films over this.",4,0,1,16 May 2004
Collateral," Mann delivers again
","While every other so-called action film is long on action and short on dialog this film is the opposite of that and it's one of the many reasons why I consider the director one of my personal favorites. Story is about a Los Angeles taxi driver named Max (Jamie Foxx) who dreams of starting his own limousine service and impresses a fare named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) who tells him she is a Federal Prosecutor and gives him her card. Later, Max picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise) who convinces him for $600 to drive him around for the evening but while at their first stop a body is thrown out of a window and lands on Max's cab. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Vincent comes back and Max comes to find out that he's a hit man with a list of five names and he must drive him around Los Angeles to kill each person on the list. Meanwhile, a cop named Fanning (Mark Ruffalo) notices that some of the bodies that have been popping up at the morgue have the same pattern of gunshot wounds and after talking with the FBI they discover that the victims are all witnesses in a case. After deliberately crashing the cab Max gets away from Vincent but notices that Annie is the last name on the list and tries to contact her before Vincent tracks her down.This film is directed by Michael Mann who has always specialized in gritty street dramas from 'Thief' and 'Manhunter' to 'Heat' and one of the things about his films that I have come to notice is that even his flawed efforts like 'Ali' are still very interesting to look at. Mann has always had a strong visual flair and here he perfectly captures the nightlife of Los Angeles from the street lights and small bars to the heavily lighted buildings of downtown. Even with the action and gun play that take place the highlight of Mann's films is the terrific dialog that is uttered and many of his films are mainly character studies with action scenes taking place every so often. Foxx and Cruise have many of these scenes where they do nothing but drive around and talk and the tension and excitement never eases from it and actually enhances the films mood. The character Vincent played by Cruise is not exceptionally well drawn out but it's not supposed to be as he merely acts as a catalyst to the character Max. By the time the film is over we never find out to much about Vincent except that this is his job but with Max we discover many things from how long he has been driving a taxi to his relationship with his mother. While this probably won't rank up there with Mann's best films this is still exceptionally well made and also gives more evidence to the talent of Foxx who is slowly becoming one of the more interesting actors working today.",7,0,1,4 September 2004
The Machinist," Effective film noir with a skeletal Bale
",I thought the sight of an ultra skinny Tom Hanks in 'Cast Away' was shocking enough but here in this film I don't think anyone can really prepare themselves for what they are about to see with this effort. The only thing that bothered me was that the weight loss really doesn't have much to do with the rest of the story although this is a well made film that (for the most part) keeps you guessing. Story is about a man named Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) who works as a machinist but weighs somewhere around 120lbs and mutters that he hasn't slept in a whole year!*****SPOILER ALERT*****The skeletal Trevor keeps company with a prostitute named Stevie (Jennifer Jason-Leigh) and together they talk about going off and starting a new life but he also starts a relationship with a waitress named Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) who works at a diner at the airport. While at work Trevor encounters a stranger named Ivan (John Sharian) who claims he works another shift but nobody else has seen or heard of him. With his lack of sleep Trevor's paranoia starts to get the better of him while trying to figure out who exactly Ivan really is but once he finds out he starts to piece together a tragedy from his past.Director Brad Anderson is also responsible for making the equally effective 'Session 9' a few years back and both of these films share an incredibly dark atmosphere that seems to be Anderson's forte as a filmmaker. One doesn't really have to be a serious film buff to recognize this as being inspired by Alfred Hitchcock especially when viewers hear the 'Vertigo' styled music score from Roque Banos but the story itself not only has elements from 'Spellbound' and 'Psycho' but 'Memento' as well. Bale has emerged as one of the more interesting actors and roles like this command attention and show that he's not just a good looking guy who can star in films because of his genetics and his career will be interesting to watch. My real beef with this film is aimed at the fact that Bale lost about 60 odd pounds and has this freakish presence on screen but it's really never incorporated into the story except when Leigh mentions it in the beginning. I understand he's playing a character that's just a shell of who he once was but it seems a tad wasted and eventually becomes a non-issue. This is just nit picking and while I thought the conclusion was satisfactory without being overwhelming (like The Sixth Sense) this is still a well made film with a distinct noir feel to it and shows once again that Anderson is a director to watch.,7,1,1,5 July 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Excellent third installment
","This third story with Harry Potter is easily better than the first film and is at least equal to the second and this third chapter seems to have a darker edge to it. Story begins with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) going back for his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and re-teaming with his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) but while at school he learns that a prisoner named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban and that he is responsible for the death of his parents and now wants to kill him! Harry meets some of the new faculty like Professor Sybil Trelawney (Emma Thompson) and Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) and while Sirius Black is still roaming the area the Dementors guard every exit but are they really going to protect them?*****SPOILER ALERT*****Word spreads that a werewolf is also on the prowl and everyone must be careful but Harry finds a map that may help him solve the mystery about Ron's rat and even the death of his parents. A giant bird/horse named the Buckbeak is to be killed so Hermione and Harry figure out how to go back into time and try and help themselves as Black and the werewolf get involved in their adventures.This third installment is directed by Alfonso Cuaron and he adds a darker tone to the series which I enjoyed and it seems to fit as each of these characters are getting older and not exactly kids anymore. In each of these films the character Hermione keeps getting more prominent and Watson could easily star in her own series of films, her character actually takes charge and brings Harry along with her! The actors are getting older and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy has grown a good foot taller than the last film. Some new actors pop up in roles like Emma Thompson, Timothy Spall, Julie Christie and Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore. Like the previous two installments this is a visual delight and there is so much detail in every scene like all the pictures on the walls having a life of their own. One of the hard parts of viewing this film is trying to catch all the action that goes on in every shot as anything and everything has a life of it's own. One thing about the story that I found confusing was Sirius Black wanting to kill Harry. I never understood why he wanted this and if it was explained in the film than I missed it. Readers of the Potter books should be more than satisfied as this story is brought to life on screen but even if you haven't read any of them (Like myself) this is still a very entertaining film from start to finish.",7,0,0,6 July 2004
Spirited Away," 'Alice in Wonderland' meets 'Brazil'
","This is considered one of the best (If not the best) Anime' films ever made and its cinematic storytelling at its finest. Not since 'Akira' has an animated film made the impact like this. This was created by the Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki who is considered a god in terms of Anime' and its his wonderful stories and imagination that makes him so special. This is the story of a ten year old girl named Chihiro who is traveling with her parents to their new home and she is sad that they have to move. Her father takes what seems like a wrong turn and they come across a structure with a tunnel in the middle. They all get out and walk through to the other side and Chihiro's father recognizes it as an old park that has gone under over the years. They come across another structure with food set out and Chihiro's parents waste no time in helping themselves to as much food as they can eat. Chihiro discovers to her horror that her mother and father have turned into pigs and she runs off to try and find help. She encounters a boy named Haku that takes her into the strange world where spirits and witches habitat and he tells her to find someone named Kamaji and ask for a job. She is looked down on as a human but she manages to find Kamaji who has eight legs like a spider and he gets her a job. Chihiro works with Lin who is an older female and she shows her what to do and where to sleep. Chihiro helps out cleaning and delivering but at night she sneaks out to talk with Haku who is helping her get her parents back and to be able to go home.Miyazaki has such a broad sense of imagination and this is reflected in his other films like 'Princess Mononoke' and 'Kiki's Delivery Service' and this film is probably even greater than those two. This film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and it certainly deserved it. One of the joys of watching Miyazaki's films is that you have no idea what so ever has to what will happen next. The characters and events take the viewer on a strange and fantastic voyage that has never been seen before. Yubaba the witch has a giant baby named Boh, Haku turns into a flying dragon and Kamaji has these dustball/spider things carry lumps of coal to a furnace that heats everything. One of the big highlights of this film is the 'Stink Spirit' that is this giant glob of river mud and Chihiro helps it get clean. While she does this she helps pull out all the junk (Bicycles, assorted metal, etc..) until we see what this spirit really looks like. This is the type of animated feature that children should view and this is not to knock American animated films but the Japanese concern themselves more with the stories. Children should view films that will enhance they're imagination but unfortunately most of the crap they are forced to watch is usually something that they can guess as to what will happen next. Miyazaki had no plans to make another film but happily he is working on another one! This is a great animated film and it should be recommended viewing for children although adults will love this also.",8,2,3,7 December 2003
The Butterfly Effect," Fairly entertaining time travel story
","If you listen to those who follow the chaos theory than something like the flutter of a butterfly's wings can cause a ripple effect that could be catastrophic and that's the primary idea here in this film as someone keeps trying to change events by traveling back in time. Story is about Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) who by reading his journal entries can travel back to a certain time in his life when he was young. As a youngster Evan suffered from blackouts and was unable to remember things that he did and he's advised by his doctor and his mother Andrea (Melora Walters) to write his day to day life in journals.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Upon reading passages in his journals Evan travels back to when he was young and finding out what exactly happened during his blackouts but he discovers that when he tries to change things in the past it has repercussions that effect not only himself but his friends. The events in his childhood also changed the lives of his girlfriend Kayleigh Miller (Amy Smart), her brother Tommy (William Lee Scott), and their friend Lenny Kagan (Elden Henson) so Evan continues to travel back and forth attempting to straighten everything out.This is directed by both Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber and it comes from their script that has been kicking around Hollywood for years until Kutcher expressed interest in it and helped get it made. We have all seen our share of time travel flicks before and the reason they keep getting made is that the basic premise is always intriguing and it's hard not to be interested in a story like this. I think the jury is still out as to how good an actor Kutcher is but I have to admit that he's pretty good here and he keeps things moving even though the film is clearly too long. My main complaint about this film is that Kutcher time travels endlessly and there is so much flip flopping going on that it grows tiresome after awhile and it does test an audiences patience. The performances are all pretty good and Smart gets a rare chance to show her versatility as an actress as her character goes from a waitress to a sorority queen to a badly scarred drug addicted prostitute. As far as time travel films go this is of course nowhere near the classics 'The Time Machine' or 'Time After Time' but it is a fairly entertaining film that boasts an attractive cast and I guess you can call me gullible because I'm a sucker for these types of films.",6,9,18,5 April 2005
Alien vs. Predator," Film ultimately lets down it's fans
","There is a question I would like to ask to the people that were fans of both franchises and it entails what exactly they were expecting from something like this. I personally had no idea and one would think that's a good idea but alas, it doesn't help matters because the makers of this never really thought out a good story. Story is set in the present where we see tycoon Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) who's satellite has picked up something that turns out to be a pyramid under the ice in the Antarctic. Weyland assembles a group of scientists, drillers, and archeologist's headed by Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan) who leads the expedition.*****SPOILER ALERT***** While searching the pyramid the group finds a strange cache of equally strange weapons but they trigger something and they end up trapped which also awakens a mother Alien who starts laying eggs. Meanwhile, three Predators show up on top and they get a signal that something or someone is disturbing their weapons and they venture down under the ice and find Weyland's group trapped. Once they start killing everyone the Aliens start showing up as well and ruin their plans as they must now combat each other and things change drastically when Alexa teams up with a Predator to kill all the Aliens before they reach the surface.This is directed by the ambitious but consistently disappointing Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon, Soldier, Resident Evil) and while it's clear he's a fan of sci-fi his vision (if I can call it that) runs somewhere around the comic book or video game mentality. If I have to give him credit for something it would be the way he sprinkles in references from other films like the Antarctic setting that comes from 'The Thing' or 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman' which is being played on television. Anderson doesn't really waste the viewers time with character development and I had to laugh when one character pulled out his wallet and started showing pictures of his kids. You know he was going to get it! The action scenes offer nothing special and the script is basically your run of the mill Alien fare with the assortment of characters being picked off one by one and of course the film ends with a scene that suggests another sequel. Even I was intrigued (to some degree) by the basic premise but the story never lives up to it's potential and one has to wonder how different this would have been with a better director.",4,1,2,25 April 2005
Batman Begins," Batman finally done the right way
","As much as I enjoyed Tim Burton's first two film's I think this new effort will leave audiences rethinking just how good they actually are and will look at Batman Begins as arguably the best of all of them in the genre. The film begins with Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) who's somewhere in the mountains of Asia in a prison camp until he meets Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) who takes him under his wing and introduces him to the League of Shadows.*****SPOILER ALERT***** The League of Shadows is run by Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) and they teach Bruce sword play and other things pertaining to overcoming one's fears but things go too far when he's asked to kill another person. Bruce is forced into a fight and Ra's is killed but he saves Ducard and then heads back to Gotham City where Alfred (Michael Caine) helps him to continue the family name with Wayne Enterprises. Gotham City has become a hotbed for crime and a syndicate run by Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) has taken over things which prompts Bruce to try and clean things up but it's not until he meets Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) that he gets an idea of how to go about it.Lucius has many things that he's invented over the years (but never used) and it's these items where Bruce constructs the batsuit, finds a prototype of the batmobile, and finds other uses for a cape that he wears. Also adding to Gotham's troubles is Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) who's alias is The Scarecrow and his forte is to spray others with a hallucinogenic that causes insanity and he works for an unknown crime boss who wants to destroy Gotham's water supply. With all that Bruce comes face to face with Ducard once again and it's he who's behind everything and wants to destroy Gotham City and even with the help from an honest cop named Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and his childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) Bruce may not be able to defeat him.Filmmaker Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) not only has crafted probably the best Batman film yet but he's re-energized a franchise that was considered dead due to the overly commercial treatment of the material. Nolan has gone to great lengths with the script and story to insure that audiences understand not only how Batman was created by Bruce Wayne but the ramifications of why. This is easily the darkest of the films and Nolan was inspired by 'Blade Runner' in terms of how he wanted this to look from the scenes of poverty to the cascading rain that frequents some of the shots. The script allows viewers to see that Wayne not only became Batman to combat crime but to also combat his own personal demons which were the result of a childhood accident and that his parents were not killed by The Joker (that Burton's film showed) but the result of a mugger. The script also shows how Batman's relationship started with future Commissioner Gordon and that Gotham City was infested with crime and mass poverty which was the real reason for the fate of his parents. I also liked the way Nolan didn't try and throw everything into the story and concentrated on just how the caped crusader originated and that the batmobile we see here isn't the real batmobile, instead the vehicle used in this film is just something that he's come across and for now it serves his purpose. My only gripes towards this film come from two things and the first has to do with why Ducard has chosen Gotham for his evil plan which in my estimation was never really made clear (unless something very simple went over my head) and the second thing has to do with the casting of Holmes. The jury's still out on just how good of an actress Holmes is but here she's bland and totally unconvincing as an assistant district attorney and her so-called romance with Wayne seems ridiculously forced. These are minor annoyances and they shouldn't stop anyone from viewing this latest chapter in the Batman films because director Nolan has gotten it right with his sharp and introspective approach and he's restarted this entertaining franchise.",8,5,7,24 July 2005
Blue Crush," Well photographed but very predictable
","I have always hated surfing and the whole shallow attitude that is usually attributed to surfers. For the most part this film proves what I have always said. Story takes place in Hawaii where we see three young women who get up early and surf. Then they head to their chambermaid jobs during the day and then head back to the beach. Anne Marie Chadwick (Kate Bosworth) was a championship quality surfer but suffered a bad spill and was injured. She has been trying to overcome the trauma of that and challenge in the big surfing contest next week. Her roommates Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) try to encourage her and help her get back in shape. Anne Marie also takes care of her younger sister Penny (Mika Boorem) but she is becoming rebellious and hanging out with the wrong sort. One day Anne Marie meets a pro football player named Matt (Matthew Davis) and gives him surfing lessons but they quickly become a couple. Anne Marie doesn't know how deep his feelings are and she doesn't want to end up being just another quick fling for a jock. This film was directed by John Stockwell who has slowly developed into a pretty good filmmaker and this is a good looking film. Its technically well made and the performances by Bosworth and Rodriguez are earnest but they're just is not a shred of character development. Yes, we know Anne Marie's mother has bailed out and she also suffered from a wipe-out but all the other characters just seem to be there to  serve her. Bosworth's character talks of never wanting to go to college but later she moans of having a hard time paying her bills. What does she expect? Of course this is a fable meant for a younger (And less tasteful) audience and teenagers seem to be the target. The plot and characters are so very predictable that when the film ended there was absolutely no surprises. Pretty much what you think is going to happen does! Most of these characters are so dumb and obnoxious that it becomes impossible to be interested in them. Why were those local boys always barking orders at Anne Marie? Who are they to tell anyone what to do? It was ridiculous toward the end of the film when those same Neanderthals were rooting her on during the competition. Are we suppose to forget they're violent behavior during the film and think that they're really decent people? I didn't and you can't help but think that they're the biggest losers on the planet. In fact, I couldn't help but feel sorry for all the characters that live to surf. What a waste of time and life and too bad that none of these people are able to have any type of a life. This film is only for people(!) that love surfing. Anyone that has read one book in their life and has more than two working brain cells should be warned!",3,1,3,19 November 2003
Before Sunset," Retrospective conversation between former lovers
","This is one of those simple but honest films about two people that meet up after time has passed and even though they have a limited amount of time they use it to try and express their emotions for those lost years. Story takes place in Paris, France where an American author named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) has just given his last interview on his book tour when he looks up and notices Celine (Julie Delpy) who he dated nine years earlier in Vienna. Jesse's book is loosely based on their relationship and even though he has to catch a flight back to the States fairly soon he decides to walk with Celine and talk.*****SPOILER ALERT*****They continue to walk and talk about their lives for the last nine years and why they didn't meet again in Vienna six months after their meeting the first time. They go into a cafe and have coffee and later take a tour boat down the river and while this goes on Jesse mentions that he is married and has a son while Celine says that she just cannot keep a man. Their conversation ends up at her apartment where she announces that 'Honey, your going to miss that flight'.This film is directed by Richard Linklater who specializes in small stories but with characters that usually come across as very honest and human. Linklater is a personal friend of Hawke's and they've worked together before so they must be very comfortable working on projects together. The dialogue is written with the collaboration of both Hawke and Delpy and there are several true references that are brought up such as Delpy being in New York during a span of time (Which she was) and Hawke mentioning that he was also which is of course true since he lives there. The film is just one continuous conversation and it doesn't seem contrived or forced, in fact the big asset is that we really do believe what they are saying to one another. Simple concept is honest in it's execution and really works on a romantic level with the beautiful location shooting in Paris and both Hawke and Delpy have a chemistry that seems to connect in an emotional sense.",7,1,4,8 August 2004
The Pianist," Haunting story
","First let me make myself clear and say Roman Polanski is a disgusting pervert and I would love nothing more than to bring him back here and throw him in jail. Now, the film................................... As I watched this powerful film I had to be honest with myself on two levels. One, I feel its a notch or two below 'Schindler's List' and we have seen this type of story filmed before. Two, a week after seeing this film I was still haunted by several scenes in the film and by the whole story itself. Very strong images that I just cannot forget. I guess thats the ultimate compliment. I just can't forget it. Adrien Brody is very strong in this film and his performance shows not just a character who survived but was so strong willed while everything began to unfold in his country and the atrocities started to rear its head and part of his strength shows as he helps hold his family together for as long as he can. The shots of the burnt out neighborhoods in Warsaw are very striking to look at. Brody climbs a wall and heads into what looks like miles of a demolished city.***SPOILER ALERT*** Towards the end of the film its very ironic that his greatest talent will ultimately save his life. He was lucky that the Nazi officer he plays the piano for obviously appreciates a true artist and was clearly awe struck by such beautiful playing. This is a special film and its story never ceases to be powerful and haunting no matter how many times you see it. I'll finish my comments by saying that Roman Polanski is a disgusting creep who belongs in jail!",8,0,0,5 March 2003
Seabiscuit," Beautiful and patient storytelling
","This is a film that requires some patience while viewing but its well worth the time because when the final credits start to roll you fully appreciate the invested time it took to get to know each of the characters. This true story starts out with Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) who first starts a bicycle shop and then goes into selling automobiles and becomes very rich. He's married and one day while out on business tragedy strikes when his only son dies in a traffic accident. His wife leaves him and now with the depression going on Charles must figure out what to do with his life. He decides to get involved in horseracing and looks for a trainer until he discovers a poor man named Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) who shows an unconventional knowledge of horses. Smith comes upon a horse that is both lazy and mean but likes his heart. He also needs a unique jockey that can ride him and this is where he meets Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) who is a down in his luck stableboy with a temper. The three men form a bond and slowly get Seabiscuit trained to race. He starts winning all the West Coast races and now Charles wants to have a big race with the East Coast horse War Admiral. The owner Sam Riddle (Eddie Jones) at first says no but Charles keeps winning and the press and public force Riddle to agree to a race. About a week before the race Red breaks his leg and instead of cancelling he tells Charles and Tom to get George Woolf (Gary Stevens) who is a very good jockey. They of course win the big race which has the largest radio audience ever but the doctors tell Red he will never race again. Later, Seabiscuit hurts his leg and the vet says she will never race again either and that he should be put down. After time passes Red wants to race Seabiscuit again! Both have healed legs but how well healed? This film is directed by Gary Ross and its only his second job at directing a film. His first was 'Pleasantville' which also starred Maguire. In both films Ross has shown a knack for heartwarming dramas without allowing the story to get to corny. The performances are top notch and everyone seems well cast especially Cooper. He's become one of the more effective character actors and he has the ability to transform himself to whatever character is needed. I wouldn't be surprised if he receives another Oscar nomination. Bridges again demonstrates the maturity needed for this film that has many quiet moments and he seems very comfortable during these scenes. Maguire who has worked with Ross before gives arguably the best performance of his career. He displays both the resentment of being left by his parents and the gratitude of becoming someone important with his gift of riding. All three actors play off each other well and its because this film clearly defines each character. This is a film that is very patient in the way it tells its story but it does a beautiful job of allowing the characters and situations to become understandable to the viewer. When the film finally ends you can't help but have a strong connection to it because you've invested so much time to get to know the characters. Not only is this good filmmaking but its good storytelling. A winning combo!",8,0,0,17 August 2003
28 Days Later...," Respectable sci-fi
","I had heard a lot about this film prior to seeing it but I still was not sure what to expect and after viewing it I came away thinking I watched something that was fairly good but certainly not anything I haven't seen before. Story starts out in England where a bunch of activists break into a lab to take pictures of the chimpanzees that are being experimented on and they let one go and it attacks the first person it comes across. Turns out the chimps are infected with a 'Rage' virus that spreads by bites or contact with blood or saliva. 28 days later a bicycle messenger named Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in the hospital all alone and starts walking the streets of London finding no one. He discovers in a church a bunch of zombies that start chasing him and he runs into two other survivors named Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) who help him. One night they are attacked again and Mark is cut. Selena quickly kills him and explains to Jim that you have only 10 to 20 seconds to kill someone after they are infected. Later they spot lights in a building and go to check it out and they find a man named Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his teenage daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). Through a hand crank radio they listen to a radio signal that says all survivors should come to their compound for safety. The four of them pile into Franks cab and head to where the signal stated to go. Along the way Frank becomes infected and is shot by the military men outside of the compound. Inside they meet Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston) who with his band of men have barricaded themselves into an area for survival. Soon they learn that Selena and Hannah are to be used for breeding purposes to continue the race. The film is directed by Danny Boyle who also helmed 'Train-spotting' and he again shows a good visual flair in his films no matter how low budget. This film is shot with digital cameras and it gives it a realistic documentary feel that reminded me of some of Steven Soderbergh's films like 'Traffic'. The story is very reminiscent of 'Last Man on Earth' and its remake 'The Omega Man. In fact, in 'The Omega Man' Charlton Heston teams up with a black female and that is exactly what happens here. The best performance in this film comes from Harris who shows a strong screen presence and it will be interesting to watch her career develop. She steals every scene she is in and she's a definite up and comer. This film doesn't really offer anything that we have not seen before and I kept waiting for something different to occur but it never happens. There are some questions that never get answered like why don't the zombies just feed on one another? And how long does it take before they die of starvation? This film has nothing new to offer but it is competently made with an effective visual style that enhances the many quiet scenes that take place. Along with the performance of Harris I found this an adequate science fiction film that fans of this genre should definitely check out. Nothing thought provoking, but effective in its own way.",6,2,4,25 July 2003
City of God," Wrenching film is both harrowing and exhilarating
",There are very few films that can capture what life is really like in virtually unknown areas and even though I have never been to the slums of Rio de Janeiro audiences will undoubtedly get a sense of the horror that takes place there. Story is about the drug wars that take place in the isolated slums in Rio and the central character is a young man named Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) who acts as our narrator and tells us early on that he always wanted to be a hood. In flashbacks we see in the 1960's that the brother of Rocket who was in a well known gang ended up getting killed which convinces him to try and stay clear of the hoods.*****SPOILER ALERT***** In the 1970's as Rocket has gotten older he has a dream of being a photographer for a newspaper but the only thing that he can do is help deliver papers. In the slums the city has been divided in two by the drug gangs where on one side you have Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele) and on the other is Li'l Ze (Leandro Firmino) and a tremendous amount of bloodshed occurs when Li'l Ze wants to kill Carrot and have total control of the city. Rocket takes some photo's that the newspaper ends up publishing and he ends up being the principle photographer when the two sides collide to try and eliminate each other.This film is directed by Fernando Meirelles who with this effort has made such an impact that only Orson Welles compares with it. This is one of the more violent films that a viewer can watch and at times it is repellent but what really makes this work is the combination of the story and it's exciting visual style. Meirelles can be described as a combination of Quentin Tarantino and Jean-Pierre Jeunet as he shows us the senseless violence but also takes his time giving the back story on each character. One of the more incredible things about the film is the casting of non-professional actors in pivotal roles with some of them actually being real gang members! This film is considered so important that the President of Brazil applauded it and went on to try and start some reform to clean up the crime in the slums. With it's violent and unflinching look at a part of the world that most of us could never conceive of Meirelles still manages to enthrall us in this extremely well made film and shows everyone that he's a director of rare talent.,8,2,5,1 February 2005
Hellboy," Fairly fun but Hellboy could use more of an edge
","No doubt that this is one of those overly silly films based on a comic book and while this is pretty entertaining it could have benefited from a more darker approach to the material. Story starts out in the later part of WWII where the Nazis and Rasputin (Karel Roden) have opened a time portal to summon the Seven Gods of Chaos which are mutant octopus lying dormant in space. American forces thwart their efforts but a small red creature has passed through the portal where it is adopted by the FBI.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Now it's the present day and Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is kept in a secret Government base where he helps the FBI battle monsters that threaten the U.S. and the world. Hellboy is raised by Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt) and he assigns a young FBI agent named John Myers (Rupert Evans) to aid Hellboy who scoffs at him. Hellboy is in love with another paranormal named Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) who's a pyrokineticist and can start fires when excited. Meanwhile, Rasputin's lover and aid Ilsa (Bridget Hodson) has resurrected him and they also summon a lizard like creature that can lay eggs quickly and this is all part of their plans to open another portal and once again try to summon the Seven Gods of Chaos.This film is directed by Guillermo del Toro who's films are some of the darkest and visually exciting of the last 5 years but that seems to be whats lacking here. With 'Cronos' and 'Mimic' and 'Blade II' this material seems tailored made for a dark visionist like del Toro but he plays it extremely safe here and the end result is just another tongue in cheek action film based on a comic book. Not that I disliked this film because I didn't and for the most part I was fairly entertained by what I saw. The big reason for it is the performance by Perlman who does a good job of giving Hellboy a distinct personality that is for the most part played in a comedic manner. Once again Perlman is buried underneath all sorts of make-up but he does allow the viewer to understand his true feelings and I was reminded of a Bruce Willis or Clint Eastwood attitude with Schwarzenegger muscles but painted completely red! The story is pretty convoluted and one can't help but think what would a bunch of mutant octopus do with this world if it had it? But the action scenes are plentiful and the actors seem to be having a good time but I do wish that del Toro could have used his brilliant dark vision to create something more distinct.",5,2,4,26 September 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Impressive looking
","This is definitely a very entertaining film and the special effects are terrific but I don't think its as good a film as the first one. We've come to know the characters already so the film dives right in with the action while the first film took its time setting up the story. I do have one major gripe in this film and its the part of the film with the two hobbits Merry and Pippin and those tree creatures. The film comes to a screeching halt when the scenes shift to that part. The tree creatures talk slow, walk slow and all the scenes with them crawl along like a drunk snail. Another complaint I have is Ian McKellen as Gandolf is hardly in the film at all. And Cate Blanchett has only one scene! The most exciting part of the film is the battle at Helm's Deep of course. These scenes are not only exciting but very impressive looking as far as filmmaking is concerned. This part of the film is really an achievement. Of course during the whole course of this bloody battle the character Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) never gets hurt. So while this is going on Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) are off in another direction battling Christopher Lee. So they're really is three stories going on at the same time. Where the first film took its time in its narrative this film plunges head first into action. The two films really are different. This is an extremely well made film and Peter Jackson should be proud but I don't think its a great film. Impressive looking and very entertaining but I'm hoping the third film will be better.",7,1,1,27 January 2003
School of Rock," Energetic School of Rock
",Watching this film I was reminded of John Belushi and the natural screen persona that he possessed and I do believe that the star of this effort has every one of his qualities and maybe more. Story is about Dewey Finn (Jack Black) who lives with his best friend Ned Schneebly (Mike White) but he has no real job and lives for rock 'n' roll although he has just been kicked out of his band for being embarrassing. Dewey answers the telephone one day and it's for Ned with the opportunity to be a substitute teacher at a private school so he decides to tell them that he's Ned and assumes his friends identity to teach 5th grade and make some money.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Dewey at first tells his class to constantly go on recess while he catnaps at his desk until one day he hears them play in music class and he gets the idea of forming a new band with them so they can enter a radio station sponsored event called 'The Battle of the Bands'. Dewey gives them all jobs and they practice everyday but they have to be careful of the Principle Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack) who checks on them from time to time.Richard Linklater is a very well known and respected independent film maker and here he gets his first chance to direct a film without worrying about the budget. The story could have been something like 'Kindergarten Cop' but it avoids the all to easy path of sentiment which can be tempting when you have children in the main cast and it instead is more of a showcase for the considerable talent of Black. This film is really all Black and he shows more natural screen presence than I care to remember but it's not that he's not a trained actor because he is but it's his high octane energy that he's born with that's incredible to watch. There are maybe two scenes in this film that are basically shot with little or no edits and the one that stands out is the scene where he starts his class playing a rock song for the first time and he moves from one kid to another so that they all end up knowing how to start playing. I didn't notice any editing during this and the camera just follows Black in a slow and deliberate swoop that is absolutely mesmerizing to watch. Black is in a band in real life and does love rock music which adds to his performance and he's so terrific in this film that I can't think of another actor that could have played this role. It's the type of performance in a film that doesn't get Oscar nominations but you have to think that maybe that's a tribute to Black who makes it all look so natural and easy. The young actors that play his pupils are all very good but my personal choice of the funniest is the kid nicknamed 'Fancypants'. The film works for just about everyone at any age level and along with Linklater's precise direction and Black's brilliant blend of comedy and insight this is something that we will all look back at as it stands the test of time.,7,1,2,7 November 2004
Hero," Film offers a new aspect in beauty and storytelling
","Starting with Ang Lee's 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' cinema has a new genre to deal with and even though we have all seen martial arts films before the way they are now made has become so visually stunning that even those who are not fans will be hearing more about them. The story here revolves around a nameless assassin (Jet Li) who has come to the King of Qin (Chen Daoming) with his version of how he killed the three assassins that have attempted the Kings life. Nameless starts out 100 yards from the King but as his story is scrutinized he is allowed to get closer until he is only 10 yards away which may or may not be what he wants.*****SPOILER ALERT***** The story involving the 3 assassins are shown in flashbacks with Broken Sword (Tony Leung) working in calligraphy that he believes helps him in sword battles. Assassin number two is his mistress Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Long Sky (Donnie Yen) being the third and since Nameless knows of their skills he uses psychology to try and defeat them. Broken Sword has an apprentice named Moon (Zhang Ziyi) that figures into the circle and adds to Flying Snow's suspicion of her so-called colleagues.Zhang Yimou has made a film that is clearly reminiscent of Kurasawa's 'Rashomon' in the manner of the narrative with the characters giving different accounts to what may have happened with the three assassins. Yimou's films are different from anything else that I have ever seen and from the ballet-like martial arts to the beautiful uses of color his films are elevated from casual viewing to being a movie going experience. Li is exceptionally well cast and reminds everyone why he became such a big star in his country and the ease in which he performs some of the martial arts sequences is very evident. There are so many breathtaking scenes that take place that it would be impossible to describe them all but it's hard to shake the images of the battles like the one on the surface of the lake, the leaves blowing in the forest, the green sheets hanging from all sides, and the storm of arrows raining down. If I have to quibble it would be the confusion of what story is true and which one's are not but aside from that this is one of those visually stunning films that helps open the door even wider for a new style in the martial arts genre and gives proof that Yimou is one of the worlds more talented directors.",8,0,0,15 January 2005
K-19: The Widowmaker," Interesting angle in familiar theme
",Forget about the accents that the actors use in this film. They don't convince anyone that they're Russian. But the story of a nuclear submarine that suffers a leak in the cooling system is fairly interesting. The sacrifices that these men had to do is pretty riveting and some of the decisions made here are ones that a normal person could not even consider! Harrison Ford seems to be having a good time playing a different type of character for a change. And Liam Neeson is actually not to bad as the captain that Ford replaces.Watching the men volunteer to try and fix the leak while exposing themselves to radiation is pretty horrific stuff and its these scenes that make the film worth while.,6,23,38,28 July 2002
Million Dollar Baby," A film so haunting that ultimately it becomes impossible to forget
","Few films stay with me after time has passed but this is one of those that not only stays embedded in my psyche but shows everyone what making films is really about. Story is about Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) who is a boxing trainer and cut man who runs a gym in Los Angeles but he also attends mass and writes letters to his estranged daughter. Living in a room in the back of the gym is Eddie 'Scrap Iron' Dupris (Morgan Freeman) who was a fighter for 23 years and lost an eye in a bout that Frankie worked on. After a fight card Frankie is approached by Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) who tells him that she wants to be a fighter and also wants him to train her but his response is 'I don't train girls'.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Maggie is from a white trash family in the Ozarks and has been working as a waitress since she was 13 but she's determined to be a fighter and shows up at the gym religiously and works very hard. Scrap talks to Frankie and convinces him to train her which he does reluctantly and after time passes she starts her professional career by knocking out her opponent. Maggie becomes quite the sensation as she knocks out her opponents and eventually talks start for her to fight the female champion in her division (Lucia Rijker) and a fifty-fifty split for a million dollars. The fight is made but during the bout Maggie is seriously injured and ends up in the hospital paralyzed from the neck down. As she lies in a hospital bed Maggie also loses a leg and tells Frankie that she wants to die and now he must dig deep into himself and his beliefs for what he is about to do.This is Clint Eastwood's 25th effort in directing and it's arguably his best ever which is incredible because last years 'Mystic River' was getting the same accolades. Eastwood's directing is such a joy to view simply because every scene in his films has some sort of meaning to them and nothing that we see is for nothing. The banter that takes place between Frankie and Scrap might appear to be idle chit chat but what it's really doing is establishing the comfortable relationship that they obviously have. For me, this film is about pain and the three characters that carry pain around with them but do their best to keep going in life. The performances that take place on screen are three of the best not only this year but in the careers of these actors and Freeman as Scrap shows a man who's been through extremely tough times but came out of it with dignity intact. Eastwood has always been an underrated performer and while some critics think he relies too much on his incredible presence I still remember him giving solid efforts in several films. Here he plays a character so haunted by his past that he would rather keep most people at a distance but his character gradually learns to love and care once again to the point that he must make the ultimate decision. Eastwood is mesmerizing and he's never been better. I have alway's said that Swank gave one of the great performances in cinema history in 'Boys Don't Cry' and here she gives another great performance that proves to everyone that she's no fluke. With her tenacity and earthiness Swank gives viewers an utterly believable character from her athletic prowess to the gut wrenching scenes in the hospital bed. It's a performance that will haunt viewers for years to come which is ironic because she did the same thing in 1999 with her Oscar winning role. I'm also a big boxing fan and I can find faults in some of the scenes such as the female champion hitting someone when they are down which in reality would result in an instant disqualification. These little flaws just mean that this film isn't entirely accurate but they don't detract from the emotional power that builds during it's duration. This is a tremendous effort from Eastwood who again shows that his direction can bring out the best in actors but what may surprise everyone (including himself) is that he brought out his own brilliant performance.",8,3,5,5 February 2005
Garden State," Good directorial debut for Braff
",One of the wonderful things about the Independent Film movement which has grown to gigantic proportions is that is gives young artists the opportunity to make small films with the hope of furthering their career. An actor on a television series in the 1970's probably would have never been given the chance to write and direct a film and what else can you say but things have changed for the better. Story is about Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) who's a struggling actor in Los Angeles but he receives a phone call from his father Gideon (Ian Holm) and learns that his mother has died from an accident. Andrew hasn't had much contact with his family in the last nine years and he takes plenty of medication which leaves him emotionally distant.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Andrew flies home to New Jersey for his mothers funeral but he leaves all of his prescription drugs at home which starts him on his road to awakening and feeling more alert. While at the funeral he recognizes one of the gravediggers as Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) who's an old friend and after talking they decide to get together and hang out. The next day Andrew meets Sam (Natalie Portman) who is funny and different and they hit it off quickly and along with Mark the three of them discover new people and places in New Jersey that help Andrew come to grips about his mother and his childhood.This film marks the debut of Braff as a director and the script which he wrote also is based on his childhood in New Jersey but what really stands out in this film is the visual style that he employs. If you take a good hard look at the script it's pretty easy to see that it doesn't really have anything thought provoking to say but what it does possess is a visual flair that showcases Braff's talent as a director. Another thing that is visible is the chemistry between Braff and Portman and while their relationship seems obvious they do perform well with each other and it's nice to see Portman in a role such as this. The film is quirky in it's delivery but the overall story is fairly simple but it does possess real charm that can be attributed to it's actors and their performances and one can't help but hope that Braff continues to direct films.,6,1,2,14 September 2004
8 Mile," I hate to admit it, I enjoyed it
","First let me say that this is a FICTIONAL account of Eminem's life! Sorry all you young gullible fools, I know you WANT to think that this is true but its NOT. So get over it! Anyway, I hate rap and I went to see this film with a chip on my shoulder and even though its far, far from being a top ten film of the year I have to admit I was somewhat entertained. Eminem is not bad in the film. He gives that raw type of performance that studios and directors look for when they put singers(!) in films. The film does have a gritty and dirty look about it that I found effective and of course, the big competition at the end! It was exciting and fun. I was very entertained by the rap competition, in fact I think it made the whole film work. Like the big match at the end of 'The Karate Kid'. But I did have some problems. Kim Basinger is horribly miscast as his mother. She doesn't work, lives in a trailer home and of course dates some worthless bum. Brittany Murphy plays the cheapest, filthiest whore since Jennifer Jason Leigh in 'Last Exit To Brooklyn'. Her character really has no redeeming quality and I felt like I needed a shower after her character was onscreen. And all the dumb dialogue...Yo Dawg! The shooting with the paintball gun I thought was a backfire for the makers of the film. If you want us to root for the guy he's going to have to act a lot more mature than shooting passerby's with a paintball gun. But I was entertained and the competition at the end is a rouser! Yo Dawg!",6,1,2,6 January 2003
Shrek 2," Inside jokes galore!
","While the first film showcased characters and events that seemed new to us this sequel is definitely more familiar with dozens of modern references to make the most stoic of critics chuckle. Story picks up from the first film where we see newly married Shrek (Mike Myers) and his ogre wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) receiving a summons from her parents to come back home but they don't know that she was turned into an ogre. Shrek and Fiona along with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) head to the kingdom that Fiona's parents King Harold (John Cleese) and Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews) rule and when they get there everyone is in shock. *****SPOILER ALERT*****While staying at the palace King Harold and a conniving Fairy Godmother Dama Fortuna (Jennifer Saunders) try and convince Fiona to leave Shrek and marry Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) but when this fails they hire an assassin cat named Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) but that doesn't work either and Puss travels along with him as his friend. Shrek drinks a potion that changes he and Fiona and Donkey into good looking normal beings but it must be certified by a kiss by midnight or else they will change back.This film is directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon who altogether make this a very funny and entertaining sequel and the question comes up about whether this is better than the original. I'm not sure if it is but I do think it's funnier and there are more in-jokes in this film that it would be impossible to catch them all after only one viewing. One example is a photo in Fiona's bedroom of Lord Justin which is a reference to Justin Timberlake that Cameron Diaz is dating in real life. One thing stands out and it's Shrek himself in that his behavior and manners are different from the first film. Here he seems more domesticated and (Dare I say it?) normal. But I guess that can be explained by the fact that he's in love and marriage will change a man..er..ogre. I don't really think this effort approaches the greatness of 'Finding Nemo' in terms of detailed animation and even in the basic story but this is still an extremely enjoyable film that is chock full of humor.",7,0,0,9 July 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Very stylish homage to the martial arts films of the 70's
","As this film opens we read in the credits that this is Quentin Tarantino's fourth film and he again shows us an updated version on a certain genre of film that he grew up on and obviously loves. Film starts with The Bride (Uma Thurman) already beaten to a bloody mess and talking to Bill (David Carradine) who shoots her in the head. She somehow survives and lies comatose in a hospital bed. She was pregnant before her attempted murder but when she awakens her baby is gone. Bill finds out that she is still alive and instead of killing her while she lies in a hospital bed he admires her toughness and orders his hired assassins not to finish her. The Bride sneaks out of the hospital and upon regaining her strength she makes out a death list for her revenge. The list has Bill and the four assassins who shot and beat her. The four assassins are Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), O-Ren Ishi (Lucy Liu), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen). She first goes to Vernita's and is involved in a knife fight. After she dispatches of her The Bride gets on a plane to Okinawa, Japan and tracks down a master sword maker named Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba). Hanzo allows her to stay for a month while he makes her a special sword. Then The Bride heads to Tokyo and finds Ishi who has become a crime boss in that city and surrounds herself with several henchmen and women who all have a special fighting talent. The Bride follows Ishi into a nightclub where a very violent stand-off takes place.*****SPOILER ALERT*****The bride finishes off Ishi but keeps her lawyer Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus) alive so that she can send a message to Bill. The film ends with Bill talking to Sofie and asking a very revealing question that sets up a very interesting second part. Tarantino has always shown so much enthusiasm in his films and there is an abundant of energy in each scene. While the story for 'Pulp Fiction' was more complicated this is not. It's strictly a revenge film and all the ingredients from the samurai action films of the 1970's are here. They were all basically revenge films then and it's why Tarantino choose the plot. While the story is relatively simple there still is a lot going on around it to make it a fascinating film to view and one of the things that jumps out is the music. Tarantino uses several bits of music from television and other films like the themes from TV shows 'The Green Hornet' and 'Ironside' and the film 'White Lightning'. Thurman wears a yellow outfit while she rides a motorcycle and it's exactly like the one Bruce Lee wore in 'Game of Death'. I don't think this is Tarantino's best film by a long shot but it is his most impressive looking. It doesn't have the grit like 'Reservoir Dogs' and it's not groundbreaking in the way it tells it's story like 'Pulp Fiction' but visually it's a cinematic spectacle. Thurman shows what a strong and versatile actress she is. She seems comfortable in both starring and supporting roles. Here she's not only the star but it's her most physically challenging role to date. She's up to the task and her tall physique adds to her performance. All the little things that Tarantino throws in like the music and the unique casting and the locations make this a fun film to view. This is extremely bloody and limbs and heads are chopped off in record numbers so the squeamish may want to steer clear. But for Tarantino fans and those who are familiar with the samurai films that this is an homage to than your in for quite an experience.",7,0,1,10 October 2003
A Bug's Life," Another hit from Pixar
","There are so many different stories that could be written about the world of bugs and this is an enjoyable one but I hope the creators of this film don't give up on making animated features about insects. The stories that could be used are endless! This story is about an ant colony that has to harvest food for the marauding grasshoppers that fly in every season. One of the ants is Flik (Dave Foley) who has big ideas but is accident prone and when the grasshoppers are about to fly in Flik makes a blunder that destroys the food that was picked for them. The grasshoppers are headed by Hopper (Kevin Spacey) and he threatens the ant colony by telling them that when they return next time there had better be double the amount of food. The colony's Queen (Phyllis Diller) and her daughter Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) are furious with Flik but he tells them about his plan to combat the grasshoppers. His idea is to leave the colony and venture out to find warrior bugs that he will bring back to fight off Hopper and the rest. They agree so Flik walks off to another area where bugs congregate and eventually he comes across a group of insects that want to help. The insects are ex-circus performers and are unaware that Flik wants them to fight grasshoppers. They think that they are brought in to perform for the colony.
This film was directed by John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton who both created 'Toy Story' and together they are helping to keep Disney's legend alive and prosperous. They have a good memory for the Disney classics of old and there are many observances (Both clear and obscure) of those films. The computer animation at Pixar seems to be getting better and better and a clear sense of this is the incredibly detailed scenes during the rainstorm. These scenes are a marvel to look at and its hard to figure how they could make these images so rich with intimate details. The story is rather amusing and I was reminded of 'The Three Amigos' and 'High Plains Drifter' as I watched this. This film came out the same year as 'Antz' and I guess the comparisons are inevitable but I think that film has a more adult tone to its story. This film is more in line with its targeted audience of much younger viewers but I did enjoy both films for different reasons. Roddy McDowall is the voice of Mr. Soil and this turned out to be the last film that he ever worked on. This is another very entertaining animated film from the great Pixar Studios and probably the main reason for their success is that even though these stories are aimed at a young crowd both adults and children can enjoy them. They're is enough entertainment for any age group.",7,0,1,28 December 2003
Big Fish," Even with the sentimentality this film works
","This film is about a man dying but its not what I would call a sad picture, but one that celebrates life's adventures and unique characters. Albert Finney plays Ed Bloom who is bed ridden and only has days left but this still doesn't stop him from telling his infamous stories about his exploits as a younger man. Ed's wife Sandra (Jessica Lange) loves to hear them but their son Will (Billy Crudup) is sick of them and thinks that his father uses these stories to hide his real life. As Will stays with his family he starts to discover clues that tie in to some of the tales he has heard. The stories are about Ed (Ewan McGregor) leaving his small town of Ashton to do good for others and along the way he meets a giant and convinces him to go on to bigger things. Ed takes a detour and runs into a small town called Spectre which appears to be like heaven with all the residents being very friendly and pretty young barefoot ladies prancing about and they want him to stay but he says no. Then he takes the giant to a circus run by Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito) and while there he sees the love of his life Sandra (Alison Lohman). He works for Amos to find out more about her and eventually finds out what college she attends and goes to see her.*****SPOILER ALERT*****They both profess they're love for each other but its cut short when Ed receives his draft notice and while in the war he parachutes right into a Red Chinese stage show where he meets Siamese twins that share two legs.
Will had never gotten along very well with his father but the more he listens to him during his last few days the more he understands how important these stories are. Will also figures out that there is a lot of truth behind many of them and this seems to bring them closer as the end nears.This film is directed by the incredibly imaginative Tim Burton who has made an impact by telling his own versions of wild stories and his special talent as a director is evident in the flashback scenes with McGregor. This may sound cliche but this is a very magical film filled with an abundant of rich and weird characters and this is the type of storytelling that Burton excels in. He has always brought his viewers to places that we have never seen before and unique characters that we have never met. Some parts of this film reminded me of 'Edward Scissorhands' but it also reminded me of another film that Burton had nothing to do with, 'The Princess Bride'. The casting is interesting as McGregor looks very much like Finney during the early 60's although Lohman doesn't have much resemblance to Lange. This film does get a tad overly sentimental but this is not a sad film and it does a good job of showing how special Ed's life was. Its not exactly thought provoking stuff but I allowed myself to go with it and I enjoyed myself for the whole ride. Burton usually doesn't allow his scripts to get this soft but its a film full of indelible images and characters that are not easily forgotten.",7,0,0,12 January 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Kaufman successfully strikes again
","Charlie Kaufman has got to be the strangest person alive but thankfully he channels his energy into writing stories for films that are not only complicated to watch but difficult to explain. This story is about a shy and introverted man named Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) who one day meets an outgoing and extroverted woman named Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet). They end up having a relationship but one day it all goes wrong and they split up. Joel wants her back but discovers that she has had him erased from her memory. He finds out that a company called Lacuna is behind this and he decides that he also wants to go through the procedure and have Clementine erased from his own memory. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Joel meets Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) at Lacuna and starts the procedure with the help from his assistants Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood). A computer is hooked up to a helmet that Joel wears while asleep and a monitor points out specific areas of his brain that harbor memories of Clementine. While asleep his subconscious has second thoughts and decides that he doesn't want to forget her. Joel and his memories of Clementine try to hide in other memories but keep getting found until time runs out. Dr. Mierzwiak has a past with his nurse Mary (Kirsten Dunst) who's memory was erased and when she finds out she decides to send Joel and Clementine their files so that they know what has happened to them.
This film is directed by Michel Gondry who also helmed 'Human Nature' that was written by Kaufman also. Most of the film is an assortment of scenes where Carrey and Winslet talk to each other about their relationship while the outer structure of his memory seems to be caving in around them. In one scene the two of them are in Joel's kitchen when he was four years old with his mother and then in the next shot they're at the beach where they supposedly met for the first time. This film could be described as an exercise in style but it's more about the script than the visuals and it works on both levels. Kaufman has this uncanny knack of writing about dysfunctional people and really showing how their thought process works. His stories dissect the inner workings of these characters and by the end of the film the viewer usually has a good understanding of these people. Like 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation' this is a film that requires your constant attention and it is a challenging viewing but that's what films are suppose to be like. Carrey again is showing that he can play serious roles even though he is still funny in certain scenes here and he's very good with this complex character. Winslet seems to be perfectly cast as the outgoing Clementine and she reminded me a little of Melanie Griffith in 'Something Wild'. In this world of contrived, shallow, and predictable Hollywood films Charlie Kaufman is a welcome addition. No, he's a godsend. I can't wait until this mad genius gives us more of his ideas and true film lovers (like myself) can view something interesting.",8,0,1,21 March 2004
Saw," Intrigueing premise falls short
","While I found 'Open Water' and 'The Blair Witch Project' very effective in what they both wanted to do I definitely didn't think the same with this film. Instead, I came away thinking that these young filmmakers were just trying to cash in with a gimmicky concept aimed at mostly young film viewers. Story starts out with two men waking up in the bathroom of an abandoned building and they're both chained to pipes on opposite sides of each other. Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and a photographer named Adam (Leigh Whannell) are the two men and in between them is a body with a tape recorder and a gun and as they talk with each other they figure out who is probably behind this.*****SPOILER ALERT***** It dawns on Gordon that they are victims of the Jigsaw Killer who kidnaps his victims and puts them in some horrible predicament with the weird notion that they will appreciate life better if they survive and with these two they find cassettes in their pockets with a message about what they must do and Gordon must kill Adam by 6 o'clock or his wife and daughter will be killed. They are also given saws in which they are to cut their feet off if they want to get out and it becomes a race against time as Detective David Tapp (Danny Glover) starts to close in on the identity of the Jigsaw Killer.Director James Wan and screenwriter/actor Whannell made this film in about 18 days with more than 90% of the principle photography shot in one building with several sets built for the different scenes. I do give Wan lots of credit for directing this because parts of this actually work in terms of being a horror/serial killer genre film but the script throws so much into the mix that eventually it loses steam. If the script had stuck with the basic premise of 'saw your foot off and you live' I think this would have worked so much better but unfortunately screenwriter Whannell gives viewers more twists and turns than a game of Clue. There are about three things I found distracting and the first are the scenes with the film sped up with choppy editing that's just annoying and dizzying to watch. Secondly, Glover is a natural to play a cop but his character consistently fails in whatever he's trying to do. There was maybe two moments when he's chasing the killer and could have shot him in the leg (or worse) to stop him but he keeps missing and gets his ass kicked. Thirdly, the script goes off track with all the games that Elwes and Whannell are supposed to figure out like 'find the X' and the ending that ultimately sets itself up for a sequel. The Achilles heel for this film is it's far-fetched visions of grandeur and since the makers are in the process of producing a sequel I hope they come to the realization that a little simplicity goes a long way.",3,3,5,15 March 2005
The Last Samurai," Film has a Samurai heart and spirit
",This is a film that takes a good hard look at how Japan was starting to change with its business deals with western civilization but the Samurai were still committed to the old ways of Japanese culture. This story is about a former Civil War captain named Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) who is an alcoholic and haunted by the memories of all the killing that was done during his tour of duty. Algren is offered a job in Japan to help train Japanese soldiers how to fight with modern weapons like guns and cannons. He arrives in Japan and starts to help train the soldiers but they are eons away from being ready to go into battle with the Samurai. Algren is told to lead them into a fight even though he knows they are not ready and after a very bloody fight where his army is nearly wiped out Algren is wounded and when a Samurai warrior is about to finish him off Algren kills him. Algren's life is spared when the leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) decides to bring him back to their village so that he can learn more about his enemy. Katsumoto and the Samurai are at war with the Japanese that want to change Japan into a more modern country that has trade deals with the Western culture. Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura) is young and envies the pride and traditions of the Samurai but he also wants to do what is best for his people so he is in the middle between the two armies. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Algren spends months living in the village among the Samurai and at first he is quiet but slowly he learns to respect them and their way of life. He is forced to live with Taka (Koyuki) who is the widow of the warrior that he killed and this makes him reflect on his own actions as a soldier. Algren learns to speak Japanese and how to fight with a Samurai sword. During the course of time there is mutual respect between the two and after Katsumoto is taken prisoner by the other side and about to be killed Algren decides to help him escape and fight with him in a final bloody battle.This film is directed by Edward Zwick who also made the very good 'Glory' and he knows about making films about characters that are questioning their own motives with war as a backdrop. The cinematography is important when your making a film as epic looking as this and Zwick hired the great John Toll who also shot 'Braveheart' and 'The Thin Red Line'. There are several glorious shots and the battle scenes are extremely well angled with shots from the more fierce infighting to the long shots of a whole landscape of warriors. Cruise is good as Algren but not for a moment did I forget that I was watching one of the biggest movie stars in the world. His conviction to the role is admirable but this is nowhere near as good a performance as 'Born on the Fourth of July'. The best performance in the film comes from Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto and he shows both martial arts skill in the action scenes and screen charisma in the quieter moments. Koyuki as Cruise's love interest is a real beauty and she has natural screen appeal. She shows grace and poise and her understated role is effective. The script does a good job of showing how the Japanese were at odds with themselves as times were changing and the Samurai ideals were looked at as being antiquated. After a very bloody battle the film has a more Hollywood style ending and I do believe that this hurts the impact of the film. It has to do with the character by Cruise and with a more independent minded script this would have been even better I believe. This film still is very impressive looking and it does possess a lot of heart and spirit.,7,1,2,14 December 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Excellent sequel
","I was entertained by the first film but I think I enjoyed this one even better. I'm not sure why, maybe because I'm already familiar with the characters so now I could just sit back and instead of trying to figure out who is who I can just enjoy the story. My favorite scene is the spiders! Terrific special effects. what a visual delight, or nightmare! And I was also feeling some sadness as I watched Richard Harris. It's not going to be easy filling his shoes with another actor. I also thought that if they are going to make two more films they had better hurry. These young actors are growing by the minute and it will look pretty ridiculous if Harry Potter needs a shave. Entertaining all the way, This film is fun for adults as well as kids. Chris Columbus has come a long way since those silly 'Home Alone' movies.",7,0,1,12 January 2003
Three Colors: Blue," Binoche is captivating in 'Blue' film
","The film 'Blue' is very blue. Dark blue in fact. A lot of questions were brought up in the film and none were answered and thats what makes this interesting and well made film aggravating. It is a film to be admired but the open holes make it hard to embrace. The one thing that cannot be denied is the terrific performance by Juliette Binoche. Even in a film that is hard to handle is watchable because of her. And this is a very good performance by her. Her character Julie is interesting as we watch her separate herself from her past and most of the outside world. But then she is slowly dragged back in. This film seems to be overrated by some critics and underrated by others. Its a very good film and an excellent performance, but those holes keep it from being more than that.",7,1,4,30 September 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Visually stimulating
","This is the second in the series and as I watched this spectacle I had to think of what kind of imagination Andy and Larry Wachowski have in their psyche. As difficult as it is to watch and understand these films its almost unfathomable to think up a story like this. The story continues with Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburn) as they try and figure out how the machines can be stopped from invading their world and they suspect that there is a leak somewhere. The shots of the human world reminded me of some of the sets in the 'Lord of the Rings' films. Big and cavernous and some of the shots inside the homes looked like it may have been shot on a large ship. Actor Anthony Zerbe plays Councillor Hamann and Gloria Foster is the Oracle. They are the ones that give the okay to infiltrate the other side and try and locate the 'Keymaster' who is suppose to have a key that can unlock a special door. Their are some lapses in the film where nothing happens and some have complained about them. But what are you going to do? Complain that the makers of the film were trying to move the story along without action? You can't have action every minute. The action scenes are spectacular though. At times they become almost breathtaking and technically they are some of the best ever put on film. I also felt that they were just put in for eye candy and had little to do with the story. The battle between Neo and the 100 agent Smith's seemed pointless although it was fun to watch! Reeves seems to have even less lines to speak in this one than the first. He just stands around when not kicking ass. The character of Trinity played by Moss is the one that seems to have been expanded. You can make a good point that she steals the film. Film has no real ending and it just sets itself up for the third installment that comes out this fall. I felt some mixed emotions when I was done watching this and while technically its probably more impressive than the first film I felt Reeves character of Neo seemed under used. Also, what was that messy dance all the people were doing in the first part of the film? Can't they wear shoes? Story structure seemed a little off but this is still a very entertaining film to watch. Visually stimulating and some truly memorable action scenes make this a fun viewing experience. For you trivia buffs out there, at one point in the film a police radio utters the phrase 'One Adam-12'. Also, boxer Roy Jones Jr. has a small role.",7,1,2,5 June 2003
Mystic River," Terrific performances outshine the story
","After this film was over I thought for a moment about what I had just watched because I wasn't thrilled with the way it ended. But I couldn't ignore some of the best performances of the year and it dawned on me that the conclusion of this film was unimportant. The long road this film takes to tell this compelling story is whats important. Story starts out with three boys in Boston during the 1960's who are playing in the street when one of them is taken by a couple of child molesters and abused. Now 25 years later we see what has happened to them and Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins) who was abducted is a handyman and lives in the same neighborhood. Also living in the neighborhood is Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn) who owns the corner market and he's also an ex-con and married for the second time to Annabeth (Laura Linney). The third friend is Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) who is a homicide detective and separated from his wife. One day Jimmy's daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) doesn't come home and later the police find her body beaten badly and shot. Sean and his partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne) are in charge of the investigation and this reunites him with his childhood friends that he has not seen in years. Meanwhile, on the night of the murder Dave comes home very late and bloody. His wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) asks him what has happened and he tells her that he was mugged and fought back and that he might have killed the assailant. Celeste doesn't see any story in the paper and after the murder of Katie she starts to think that her husband may be involved. Sean and Whitey during the investigation find out that Katie was dating a boy named Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry) and they were planning on going to Nevada. Jimmy is impatient with the police and with the help from some neighborhood thugs he starts to hear things about who the police are questioning. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Sean finds out that Dave saw Katie the night she died and upon further questions they notice the cuts on his hand. They try and talk to Celeste but she doesn't say much but they can see that she is acting odd. Jimmy finds out about Dave being a suspect and when Celeste has moved out he asks her if she thinks Dave is responsible for his daughters death. She answers 'Yes'. Sean and Whitey also find out that the bullet in Katie matches a gun owned years before by Brendan's father. This is the 24th film that Clint Eastwood has directed and he shot it in Boston which gives this a real authentic look and feel. Eastwood again shows us that as a director his films are extremely well detailed and each scene seems to have a real purpose to them. The performances in this film are what make this special and Penn and Robbins are the center of this story. Penn portrays Jimmy as a very loyal man who despite his hard upbringing remains someone who grew roots in his neighborhood. He obviously loves his neighborhood and has strong ties to it emotionally. Penn has that hardened look in his eyes and he again demonstrates why he is one of our finest actors. Penn is torn as a character in many ways. As a child watching his friend being taken away by molesters, a grieving father, and then to figure out what to do about Dave. Robbins is at the top of his craft as well. We can see that the events that happened to him have scarred him for life. In every scene that Robbins is in we can see in his eyes the pain that has remained in him. I have to admit that I didn't love this film and the way it ended has to do with it. Towards the end of the film Bacon finds out what Penn has done and instead of acting like a cop he stands there with him and they both pontificate about their youth. It doesn't exactly ring true and I do believe Bacon would have acted in a different manner. And the scene with Linney when Penn tells her what he has done is totally out of the blue. Linney was pretty quiet during the course of this film and then inexplicably she behaves like Lady Macbeth. It just comes across as weird and I thought it was the weakest scene in the film. But as I mentioned before this film is not about what happens. Its where three men who were childhood friends are now thrust together under terrible circumstances and they're loyalty is tested. Eli Wallach who was Eastwood's co-star in 'The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly' has a small role as a liquor store owner. Its good to see Bacon in a good role and he's been in so few the last ten years or so. He really needed this part to remind everyone what a very good actor he is. Eastwood's direction is precise and deliberate and he's become a master craftsman at his trade. Even when the story falters some at the end his film is saved by some incredible performances. One of the years best films.",8,1,1,13 November 2003
War of the Worlds," Spielberg's (attempted) homage to 50's sci-fi
","With all the remakes that are taking place in Hollywood you would think that a great filmmaker like Steven Spielberg would either be too busy for remakes or at least add something special to familiar material but this latest effort comes off (at best) as passable summer fare. This updated H.G. Wells story starts out with a divorced crane operator named Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) who has his children for the weekend while their mother Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) heads to Boston to see her grandparents.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Ray's children are Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and they naturally have a problem being with their immature father but all that changes with what appears to be the start of a lightening storm and lightening hitting key areas on the ground. To everyone's shock alien spacecraft has been buried underground for an unknown amount of time and now they've come to the surface and started to disintegrate everyone (and everything) in their path! Ray and his kids head out of town in what may be the only working car (for the time being) and soon figure out that the planet Earth is under attack. Ray is trying to head to Boston to find his ex-wife but along the way he loses the car to rioters and also meets a strange survivalist named Harlan Ogilvy (Tim Robbins) who ends up being more of a threat than actual help.Spielberg grew up in the 1950's and like many others has fond memories of not only the numerous sci-fi movies that were made but of the 'scare' films involving 'duck and cover' that young students were forced to view. Spielberg uses many elements of both the original film and Wells own story in the script such as the look of the tripod ships and the red weed. Like many other of his efforts Spielberg incorporates the theme of a troubled home into the story and when Cruise isn't trying to stay alive from an alien invasion he's desperately attempting to keep some sort of semblance of a family unit together. For the most part I was entertained by what I viewed on screen and both Cruise and Fanning give pretty good performances but I have to be honest and say that I wasn't overwhelmed by anything I saw. There were a few things that irked me (to some degree) and the first has to do with what the aliens intentions are concerning humans. They disintegrate people but they also use them for their blood...can't they make up their alien minds on what they want us for? Before I even went to the theater I instinctively knew I would be disappointed by the appearance of the actual aliens and I was but I did feel a chill whenever the giant tripods made that mechanical bellowing sound. I also had to laugh when I saw how much terror and trauma Cruise's character goes through in this film because regardless of what he has been saying in the media about prescription drugs and psychiatry I thought his character definitely needed to be put on anti-depressants and to see a good shrink! Fanning's character looks so shaken that I expect her to spend the rest of her life in a rubber room in the hospital sucking her thumb in the fetal position. But jokes aside, this is an entertaining effort that hits enough good notes to give it a recommendation and though it's more in line with 'Independence Day' than something classic like 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' this is still (generally) a fun film to view.",6,1,4,25 July 2005
Love Actually," Charming 'Love Actually'
","This is the definitive romance film and its not just about one couple but about twelve! This film runs about 2 hours and 10 minutes and it crams a lot of characters and events into that span of time. Emma Thompson is Karen and she is married to Harry (Alan Rickman) and things seem to be fine but she notices the obvious flirting between him and his secretary. Things get worse when she finds out that he bought an expensive piece of jewelry for her. Liam Neeson plays a recently widowed man named Daniel and his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster) is in love with an American girl at school and together they try and figure out how he can get her to notice him. Hugh Grant is The Prime Minister and on his first day in office he meets Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) who works for him and he is attracted to her. We watch an aging rock star named Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) who has put out a bad Christmas CD and he has come to realize that he has no one in his life after all these years. Harry works with Sarah (Laura Linney) who is in love with  Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) but is too shy to tell him. Colin Firth is a writer named Jamie and he falls in love with his Portuguese housekeeper Aurelia (Lucia Moniz) but there is a language barrier keeping them from communicating they're feelings. A young bride named Juliet (Keira Knightley) finds out that her husbands best friend has been secretly in love with her since the beginning and she is stunned. A young man named Colin (Kris Marshall) can't find a girl and thinks that its because they're British so he decides to travel to Wisconsin where he can find an American girl.
This film is directed by Richard Curtis who is the great writer of such films as 'Bridget Jones's Diary' and 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' as well as 'Notting Hill'. Romantic stories are his forte and he possesses a real knack for creating romantic scenarios for characters. This is the first time Curtis has directed a film and he manages to juggle a plethora of events and characters and he does pull it off for the most part. Some of the stories work better than others like the Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman crisis and Bill Nighy practically steals the film as an aging rock star. Hugh Grant also fairs pretty well as The Prime Minister in love and he seems to be cut out of the same mold as Cary Grant. Others don't come off very well and I think Kris Marshall as Colin going to Wisconsin is totally ridiculous and contrived. Nothing seems to come of Linney and her infatuation with a co-worker. It was never resolved and just seems to fade away without any closure. But this is a genuinely charming film and has so many romantic moments in them that I'm sure any viewer can find one or two that work best for them.",7,0,1,30 November 2003
Wedding Crashers," Funny concept but horribly written
",The first 30 minutes or so of this film was so funny that it appeared that this was going to end up as one of the better comedies to come out in years...so what happened? The fault has to go primarily with the writers who lack the experience to keep up the wit for the entire length of a film because the last scene or two became almost unbearable to sit through. Story is about two best friends named John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn) who when they aren't divorce mediators crash various weddings in order to score with vulnerable chicks.*****SPOILER ALERT***** One ceremony that they end up crashing is the daughter of Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken) who is grooming himself to be President one day. This is where John meets Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams) and falls head over heels in love but she's involved with a complete jerk named Sack Lodge (Bradley Cooper) who wants to marry Claire and align himself with the Cleary name.This is directed by David Dobkin who worked with Owen before in the first 'Shanghai Knights' film and also with Vaughn in 'Clay Pigeons' and he seems to have the ability to handle comedies such as this with ease but it's a shame he couldn't do more to fix up an utterly predictable script. Both Steve Faber and Bob Fisher are responsible for writing this and you can all call me paranoid but I have a deep sense that the truly funny dialog that occurs when Owen and Vaughn speak to one another might be ad-libbed by the two. These are the best moments in the film and it's fun to watch these two because not only do we consider them funny but we know that they're best friends in real life and they (naturally) look comfortable shooting witty lines off of each other. I personally can't say for sure if this is true but It's hard to imagine that the same writers who have Owen giving one of those 'don't marry him...I think I love you' speeches (at an altar yet!) are the same ones who wrote the dialog. I don't believe it! There were two other things that I did enjoy and the first was McAdams who continues to show that she's one of the brightest young actress's to come on the scene in the last few years and Jane Seymour who plays McAdams mother still shows that she's one of the sexiest ladies in both television and film. Someone get her in another sexy role (hopefully one that's more revealing) before it's too late. This film wants to be reminiscent of the raunchy comedies of the 70's and 80's but it fizzles out fairly quickly and ends just like the badly written romantic comedies of the last 10 years or so. This had an extremely promising concept but it becomes hopelessly predictable and even the usually reliable Walken is reduced to just staring when he should have had the opportunity to give one of his patented speeches.,5,1,5,28 July 2005
Ice Age," Predictable story
","This is the second animated feature by Twentieth Century Fox and I thought the general idea was endearing enough but it just plods along in a very predictable manner. The story of course takes place in the ice age and we see a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo) being saved by a mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano) and they start traveling together during the southern migration. Also, some sabertooth tigers want to get revenge on a tribe of humans and the leader of the pack decides to steal a human baby and he selects a tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) to carry out this mission. He chases the human mother until she and her baby jump into the river and disappear. She washes up down the river where Manfred and Sid find her. She dies but the baby is alive but then Diego shows up and wants the baby. Manfred and Sid say no but Diego says he can lead them to a pass in the mountains where the humans are going and they can hand the child over. But Diego is really leading them to an ambush where the other tigers will be waiting. So the journey begins and at this point in the film Diego discovers the importance of being in a herd and how you should look after one another. The story is very predictable and you can guess what is going to happen before it even happens! There really is nothing new here. A band of talking animals protecting a human baby, haven't we seen that before? Didn't that happen in 'Monsters Inc'? The animation is not overly impressive although some of the shots have some good detail. As you watch this film the animation just doesn't grab your attention. I think part of the reason is the bleak landscape. How attention grabbing is the color white? It doesn't leave a lot of room for detail. I did enjoy Ray Romano's voice for his character. His deep and slow drawl seems perfectly suited for a slow moving mammoth. Its not a bad animated film and its hard not to root for these characters no matter how hokey the story is. But the story is really aimed at a very young audience and it should work best for that mentality. But if your a teenager or older than you will easily spot how familiar the story is.",5,1,3,12 July 2003
Man on Fire," Over the top but effective revenge flick
",There are so many reasons to dismiss this overwrought action film but in the end I had to be honest with myself and admit I enjoyed most of the chaos that ensues in this. Call me human! Story is about an ex-military officer with a long resume in anti-terrorism and weapons but his past is haunting him and he's become an alcoholic. Denzel Washington is Creasy and while in Mexico City visiting his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken) he is referred for a job as a bodyguard for a young and wealthy family. Creasy works for Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) and his American wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell) and most of his job consists of watching their daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) whom he slowly begins a friendly relationship with.*****SPOILER ALERT*****One day Pita is kidnapped and Creasy shot and wounded in the process and as he lies in the hospital he learns that she has been killed when the drop-off for the ransom went badly. Creasy eventually gets well enough to promise Pita's family that he will track everyone down that's involved and kill them and he does this with the help of a reporter named Mariana (Rachel Ticotin) and an Interpol expert named Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) and he soon finds out that there are many people involved in the recent kidnappings in the city. One by one he finds people that are connected and he gets enough information from each of them before he kills them and all this leads to a mysterious man known only as 'The Voice'.This film is directed by none other than Tony Scott who specializes in these action films and he usually does them with a visual flair that's evident here. But even with the visual style this film can't hide the many things that could have (Should have?) ruined this and the first thing I asked myself was how can a 6'1' black American roam about Mexico City without being noticed especially in those rat infested barrios? Washington's character seems to have an unlimited access to any weapon he wants not including the money he's shelling out. One other observance is the extremely loose fitting suits that he wears during the film. Couldn't someone point him to a tailor? But while I point out these flaws I'm the first to admit that Washington is very good in this film and delivers a first rate performance despite the silly material. Fanning bats her eyes and gives one of her patented cutesy roles that screams 'AAWWWWWWW'! The film is just way to long at almost two and a half hours(!) and it resorts to some incredibly violent scenarios but I still recommend it because as a 'Man determined to get revenge' genre film and the strong performance by Washington it's a film that does hold up enough to entertain most viewers.,6,1,2,24 October 2004
Downfall," Powerful film about the last days of the Third Reich
","We have seen numerous portrayals of Adolph Hitler in films before but we've never seen one like this that uses facts to give viewers an incredibly honest portrayal. In my voting I gave this film an 8 but I'm ready to give it an even higher number because it's one of those amazing films that will stay with viewers for years to come and I think has the greatness in it to be thought of as a classic and should be studied by students of film. Story is about the last few days of the Third Reich where we see Berlin crumbling from the Russian forces and Adolph Hitler (Bruno Ganz) and those around him having to go underground in a bunker. Hitler is approaching his 56th birthday and we see him displaying emotional outbursts when his orders are not carried through and we also see the deterioration of his health as one of his arms trembles from a previous assassination attempt and the ravages of Parkinsons disease.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Most of the films story is told through the eyes of Hitler's stenographer Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) who is loyal to her employer but has started to wake up and see first hand what is really happening to Germany and how others are reacting. Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler) not only stays with Hitler but attempts to cheer everyone up with parties and lots of drinking and eventually she and Hitler marry in a small ceremony less than two days before they both commit suicide. Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) moves his wife Magda (Corinna Harfouch) and their children into the bunker also and when it appears that Germany has lost the war they decide to commit suicide rather than live without National Socialism. In a harrowing scene Magda slips cyanide capsules into the mouths of her children as they sleep and then she and her husband prepare to kill themselves as well.This is directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel who's source of material is inspired by the memoirs of the real Traudl Junge and the book 'Inside Hitler's Bunker' by Joachim Fest and while it's historically accurate it does an even better job of showing the blind loyalty of Hitler's followers. We have seen countless films where Nazis are portrayed in the usual over the top manner but this is the first time (that I have seen, anyway) where their point of view is shown in such an ambiguous light. Not only is their perspective shown but also the point of view from the secretaries who at first thought of Hitler as a father figure and than the realization (and incredible disappointment) of who he really is. While the production design and historical accuracy put this in a class by itself this film is still enhanced by an utterly magnificent and haunting performance from Ganz. His portrayal of Hitler is nothing like the caricatures we have seen before and Ganz actually studied rare tapes of Hitler engaging in normal conversations to get the proper tone of his voice which is vastly different than the one that shouts at crowds. There are those who criticize this film because it shows Hitler in a more human light but let's face it, the guy was human and did things that others do as well. He wasn't screaming and frothing at the mouth every second and did partake in everyday events like walking his dog and having tea with his mistress which isn't going to make anyone forget how evil and psychotic he was. Ganz's performance is so eerily accurate that he shows the trembling in one arm from the Parkinson's that he dealt with in the last 12 years of his life. This is one of those rare films that is achieved through historical fact and brought to life with some truly haunting performances and it's a film that makes a solid claim to greatness.",9,6,10,27 March 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," It's been a long journey for Lucas and the audience
","It's 1977 and I'm 15 years old when on a hot summer afternoon I ride my bike to a local theater to see the big summer smash called Star Wars and naturally there was a long line to get in. Hard to believe that 28 years later I'm still going to a movie theater to view the latest entry in this remarkable series of films and that it's taken this long to almost come full circle to where we originally started. In this film we see how young Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) save Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and bring him back to the Jedi council.*****SPOILER ALERT***** What everyone doesn't know is that Palpatine is a Sith Lord and it is he who encourages Anakin to come over to the dark side and become Darth Vader and the first person to find out is (of course) Yoda (voice of Frank Oz) who has the unfortunate task of telling Obi-Wan. Padme (Natalie Portman) is now pregnant with twins and she doesn't believe Obi-Wan when he tells her that her husband has gone to the dark side but eventually she finds out and there is a final fight to the death with light sabers between mentor and protégé.This may or may not be the last Star Wars film (I think not) but I did find this entry to be satisfying in the way that viewers are allowed to watch first hand how everything happened to where we first picked up the story with Luke and Princess Leia. Let's face it though, there are so many annoying things in this chapter that one can't help but re-think just how good of a director George Lucas really is. I've seen better line readings in Ed Wood films! To say that it appears that the actors are just reading their lines is a complete understatement. I kept expecting to see a script in their hands as they all stiffly and without emotion just blandly drone on. Portman tries but it's to no avail and the only redeeming performances come from McGregor and McDiarmid who make the best of the few takes that Lucas gave them. McGregor has the voice and mannerisms of Alec Guinness down pat and McDiarmid is downright spirited in his evil role but let's not forget about Yoda who displays more facial expressions than the rest of the cast! A couple of things come to mind from this and the first is a question...why does Yoda need a cane? Yoda gets involved in fierce fighting and is falling off of 50 foot ledges where he lands and then just dusts himself off and gets ready for more fighting! The second thing that comes to mind is that it's hard to imagine that two extremely good looking people like Christensen and Portman would have kids that look like Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. That's like if Cindy Crawford and Tom Selleck hooked up they would have children that look like Janeane Garofalo and Paul Giamatti! But the granddaddy of all complaints (for everyone else too!) is the casting of Christensen. I'll just come out and say it that I think this is arguably the worst job of casting in cinema history! All the whining from this bland pretty boy...he's supposed to be Darth Vader with James Earl Jones voice?But, I did enjoy this film and I can't help but admit that I felt a bit of nostalgia and sorrow as the film ended and I even stayed until every single credit had rolled across the screen. I couldn't help but think that this may be the last Star Wars film I'll see and it's been so many years since I was 15 years old and peddling my bicycle to the theater to view a film that would go on to be the start of the most successful franchise in history. Lucas undeniably has his flaws but he's created something with these films that is very hard to explain to those that are not fans and he's tapped into the conscience of those willing to come along for a long and fun ride.",7,2,4,27 June 2005
Ray," Foxx perfectly captures Ray Charles in body and spirit
",At a young age Ray Charles was told by his mother not to allow others to pity him and to make something of himself and as this film shows he offered no apologies for anything he did. Story shows how young Ray was raised by his mother Aretha (Sharon Warren) in Florida and how they got through not only his ultimate blindness but the unfortunate accident that took the life of his brother George. As a young man Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) travels to Seattle to try and land a job in the club circuit with his piano skills and as he steps off the bus he meets a teenage Quincy Jones (Larenz Tate) who shows him where to find his first job.*****SPOILER ALERT*****From the small club circuit and touring for small gigs Ray slowly starts to get the attention of a small label named Atlantic who sign him to a record deal. Ray starts to gain some fame with his records and he meets young and pretty Della Bea (Kerry Washington) whom he marries and has a family with. What Della doesn't know is that Ray is a heroin user and has no plans to quit but she decides to try and put up with it and stay married. All throughout his rising career Ray has numerous affairs with back-up singers and fathers other children but through all of this he still has nightmares about the death of his brother and remembering some of the words that his mother spoke to him Ray decides to kick his drug addiction.This film is directed by Taylor Hackford who has built a solid resume on mainly action/drama affairs but in 1987 he made the documentary 'Chuck Berry Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll' and his obvious love for this type of music is probably what drew him to this project. This film really doesn't come off as more than a capable retelling of Ray's life but it does the correct thing in not shying away from his glaring flaws as a person. Ray was an incredible talent and a very unique man but he was also selfish in his self gratification with women and drugs. None of this is exactly groundbreaking with news but it all comes to life with a dead on performance by Foxx who not only gives the ticks and mannerisms of Ray but captures his outgoing glow of spirit. Ray had a unique way of expressing himself and Foxx uses this to embody all of his characteristics that actually made me start forgetting that an actor was portraying him. While the script doesn't allow the film to achieve anything more than being faithful it is a showcase for the emerging Foxx who is slowly becoming one of the best actors working today.,7,1,3,14 November 2004
The Terminal," Interesting premise is handled amiably
","This is loosely based on a real event and it makes for a fascinating story but even though I do recommend this film there are several things that just don't work. Story takes place at the JFK Airport in New York City where Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) has his passport taken away after his country Krakozhia is involved in a civil war and the United States fails to recognize it. This means that Viktor is allowed to stay in the terminal until things get better in his country but he is not allowed to set foot outside the terminal doors. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) is the new security chief and doesn't know what to do with him and slowly he gets irritated by Viktor's dilemma. Viktor roams the terminal and gets to know everyone that work in all the businesses and meets a stewardess named Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is dating a married man.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Viktor helps a baggage handler romance INS Officer Torres (Zoe Saldana) and becomes friendly with the head janitor Gupta Rajan (Kumar Pallana). He also starts a flirtatious relationship with Amelia until she finds out what his real situation is and she becomes disenchanted by men in general. Frank keeps asking people what is in the peanut can that Viktor carries with him and eventually it is learned that he is trying to get the autograph of jazz artist Benny Golson.Steven Spielberg can be both praised and blamed for this film and it does possess both the best and worst of his talents. The cinematography is by the great Janusz Kaminski who not only supplies the shots of the terminal but makes the audience believe that this is actually someone's home, which it has become. Spielberg had the set of the terminal built on a sound stage by Alex McDowell and it's one of the most impressive things about the film. Hanks while not completely believable does give a good performance and even when he doesn't do much in a scene you can't take your eyes off of him. If that's not star power than I don't know what is! The best thing about this film is watching how Hanks character manages to survive living in a terminal and this part of the story is fascinating to watch. Also, there is a very good performance by Pallana as the janitor who makes the best of a rather small and quiet role. But there are several things that just don't work in this film and one is the so-called romance with Zeta-Jones who in reality would not give Viktor a second look. Also, the romance with the baggage handler and Saldana is completely unbelievable and are we really suppose to buy the fact that a hot chick like Saldana would be a Trekkie? And then they get married in the terminal? The script lays the sentiment on pretty thick as we learn about Viktor's peanut can and that he's in America for his dead father. Tucci's character could have been a much more interesting but the script just wants him to add the adversity for the film. The film ends with no emotional payoff but I still do recommend this effort by one of the great filmmakers in history and starring one our finest actors. It could have been a much more fascinating film but what we do get is more than enough.",7,0,0,5 July 2004
Bruce Almighty," Film squanders Carrey's talent
","Jim Carrey is a very talented actor and he has done some amazing things on camera in other films but this script never allows him to showcase his abilities. The story is about a television news reporter in Buffalo named Bruce Nolan (Carrey) who wants to get the anchor job at his station but is instead given jobs like covering the worlds largest cookie or interviewing someone at Niagara Falls. He feels that his life is not going the way he expected and after several bad luck incidents he is blaming God for ignoring his needs. He lives with his girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston) and she dreams of marrying Bruce. Bruce keeps getting paged and finally he calls the number that tells him to go to an address. He goes and meets God (Morgan Freeman) who tells him he is sick of Bruce blaming him for his problems so he is being given all his powers while he goes on vacation. Bruce and his new found powers go out and try to fix some of the things in his life. He teaches his dog to use the toilet and he also gives Grace bigger breasts. He also uses the powers for some unexpected happenings when he is reporting like a comet coming to Earth or discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body! Bruce tries to make everyone happy (Especially himself) but loses Grace when she see's Bruce's co-worker Susan (Catherine Bell) kiss him at a party. The films story should have given Carrey all sorts of opportunities to use his natural comedic gifts but unfortunately it does not. Instead, the script only gives him opportunities to react to humorous situations going on around him. The story is simple and silly but thats okay. The story of 'Liar,Liar' was silly also but that script gave Carrey the chance to show some of his best physical comedy put on film! This script wastes the enormous talent that it had to embody the story. This film does have some genuine laughs in it like when Bruce uses his power to make the news anchor sputter gibberish on the air or when he turns on Grace before a night of lovemaking. Only in a few moments do we see Carrey's real talent and the one scene that stands out is when he does his Clint Eastwood impersonation while in his car. Thats Carrey using his natural gifts but these are only fleeting moments. I wasn't a fan of the 'Ace Ventura' films but they did one thing right. They allowed Carrey to explode with his natural comedic talent. This film doesn't do that. Instead, the script harness's Carrey and all he has to do is react to the situations at hand. Film does deliver some real laughs but the rest of the time I was waiting to see if Carrey could emerge from the contrived story. Unfortunately, he does not!",4,1,2,28 June 2003
Signs," Well written and well made
","I enjoyed this film a lot but I have to say that the ending was somewhat of a let down. Shyamalan did the right thing in not letting the viewer see the aliens and it really builds up the suspense and tension to an unbelievable level. And the story of Mel Gibson losing his faith is handled well also. Shyamalan has always been an excellent writer and in his films the big story has always been nothing more than backdrop to the characters. Like I said, I didn't care for the ending. Like when they figure out what can hurt and kill the aliens. It made no sense. Why that? But, I really enjoyed this film and I can't wait for Shyamalan's next film.",7,0,3,14 August 2002
Identity," Familiar but well made
","This is one of those films that thank god doesn't meander to the shallow thinking of teens and young adults. It stays true to the script and original story without having a predictable (For the most part) ending tacked on. Here's a story that definitely is not what it seems. Story starts out with John Cusack as Ed. A limo driver and former police officer that is driving a movie star named Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca DeMornay) but its night and its in the middle of a violent storm and Ed accidently hits a woman in the road. Her husband is fixing a flat and their son Timmy (Bret Loehr) is in the back seat. They drive to a motel and try and use the phone but all the lines are down and the next town is 30 miles away and they cannot drive out because of the flooding. Others soon arrive because of the storm like a prostitute named Paris (Amanda Peet), A young couple who just got married, and a cop named Rhodes (Ray Liotta) who is transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey). They are all stuck and later the prisoner escapes. It doesn't take long before some of the group start popping up murdered or disappeared. Meanwhile, another part of the film has a midnight hearing on a killer who is scheduled to die the next day and his doctor (Alfred Molina) is trying to convince the judge that he is insane and didn't know what he was doing. The film is directed by James Mangold (Heavy, Cop Land, Girl Interrupted) and this is another good effort by him and he's slowly building a pretty impressive resume. I was one of those thinking that I was walking into just another thriller but this film is definitely not that. Instead, as the film unfolds it give you twists and turns that seemingly go into a strange direction until you find out what the real source of the story is. But even when you understand the basis of the story it gives you reasons to think. Fairly clever film is somewhat familiar like a 'Twilight Zone' episode or maybe something by Brian DePalma so even though it keeps you guessing it dawns on you that similar material has been done like this before. It doesn't detract from this being well directed and shot. The cinematography is well handled with the constant rain being the main source for establishing an effective mood. All the actors are up to the task but its the direction and script that the emphasis should be laid upon. Good effective thriller that has a lot more going for it under the surface.",7,1,2,11 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," Entertaining but a little chaotic
","I did enjoy this sequel I admit, but I think I'm the minority when I say that its not quite as good as the first film. The first X-men introduced us to a handful (Or two) of mutant characters and we learned about each one of them. The focus of the story was aimed at one thing but here in the sequel they have added so many more mutant characters that the main story is almost forgotten in a windstorm of action scenes. Anna Paquin as Rogue has hardly anything to do here except be frustrated at not being able to be intimate with her boyfriend. This film is definitely geared at a young audience with a lot of the characters being of the teen variety. Halle Berry as Storm is another casualty where her big mission in this film is to get children out of a tunnel. She is absolutely wasted and didn't director Bryan Singer have a better written character for this Oscar winner? The things that I think help the film for me is the mutant Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who is so sexy and strong that even when she's just standing there doing nothing you can't take your eyes off her. If they ever do a film with just her, I'm sold! Their is two performances that stood out for me and the first one is by Famke Janssen who plays Dr. Jean Grey. Its the best written role in the film and she shows real human complexities, she's not just a comic book figure. She's having problems with her telekinetic abilities because of the dreams she's been having and she's also torn between her relationship to two others. The other performance is by Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier who runs the school. He doesn't just posture and allow special effects to run his character, Stewart is too well trained an actor to allow that. In a scene at the end of the film his character is staring out a window reflecting on what has happened and what the future may hold. Even with all the impressive special effects in this film, that scene of Stewart leaves the most indelible image for me. I hope if or when they make another sequel that they try and keep just the main characters as the focus so the overall point of the film doesn't get lost like it seemed to in this film. Of all the new characters introduced here the one I liked the most was Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler played by Alan Cumming. Entertaining film but has way to much going on in such a short amount of time. Lets hope they tone everything down the next time.",6,9,18,11 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Impressive final film in wonderful trilogy
","This is the third and final film (For now, anyway) in the infamous J.R.R. Tolkien stories and its hard to argue that this may be the best of the three. The first film introduced the characters and took its time setting up the story while the second film was highlighted by a battle sequence in a place called Helms Deep. This film picks up the journey of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) who are being led by Gollum (Andy Serkis) who is suppose to lead them to Mount Doom where Frodo is to throw the Ring into the volcano but Gollum wants it and is secretly instigating events that will split Frodo and Sam. While this is going on three battles take place that will hopefully give Frodo enough time to destroy the Ring and these battles will keep the Eye of Sauron busy. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) head to Gondor while Merry (Dominic Monaghan) stays with Eowyn (Miranda Otto) at Rohan. With the army of Orc's heading to Minas Tirith in great numbers Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) go to the Cursed Mountains to try and persuade the ghosts to come fight with them so that their souls will be redeemed.
*****SPOILER ALERT*****Once again director Peter Jackson has given us a film so technically and visually stimulating that it would have to be classified as a special effects masterpiece. The scenes where actors and built sets are blended together with computer digital effects are so impressive that it's at times hard to notice what is real and what isn't. There are so many events and creatures all put into this film that you come to realize that this is really technically brilliant. The giant spider that attacks Frodo, the creatures that resemble elephants and every battle scene are exquisitely filmed. As far as the performances go Astin gives the film the humanity that it needed and his special bond with Frodo is very evident. Even when the power of the Ring tries to take him over his friendship with Frodo is what convinces him to do the right thing. In a film so blanketed with special effects Astin's performance is the touch of reality. So while I admit that this is arguably one of the most technically proficient films ever made I still ask myself 'Is this a great film'? The answer is yes but its not great like 'The Godfather' or any other great film that deals with real characters and real events. As far as movie making and all the technical aspects its easy to say that it's great but it's not of the same caliber as say 'Citizen Kane' or 'Schindler's List'. I think we should be careful as to what films we label as great. One of the flaws in these films is the lack of depth for the female characters. Otto's character comes off the best but the so-called romance between Aragorn and Arwen was never convincing. But this is nit-picking because Jackson is an incredible filmmaker and what he has created with these three films is really a landmark in cinema. Everything that he and his fantastic crew of genius's have done has in some manner changed the way certain films are to be made. These three impressive films demonstrate great storytelling and filmmaking and they are now part of history. I have heard some talk about Jackson maybe filming 'The Hobbit' which actually came first. With Jackson at the helm I can envision that film becoming part of cinema history as well!",8,1,2,17 January 2004
Fantastic Four," Lightweight Four
","With Hollywood churning out superhero films from comic books at a fast pace one has to accept that some (if not most) will be disappointing efforts that seem like rushed efforts and I think this film is exactly what I just described. Story is about Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), and her brother Johnny (Chris Evans) who go up into orbit on a space station to check on a cosmic storm but things go wrong when it suddenly changes direction and the four of them are exposed to cosmic radiation. Heading their voyage is a successful industrialist named Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) who is hard pressed by the companies CEO's to make their shares more profitable...or else.*****SPOILER ALERT***** The four of them return to Earth and find out that they have all been genetically altered by the storm with Reed (Mr. Fantastic) being able to stretch like rubber and Ben (The Thing) turning into a Hulk-like figure made out of orange rock. Susan (Invisible Girl) can turn invisible and create force fields while Johnny (Human Torch) can become supernova hot and also fly but what they don't know is that Von Doom was also altered by the storm. Dr. Doom is slowly becoming metallic and electrical and when he is fired after the space catastrophe he vows revenge on all those involved including the Fantastic Four.For whatever reason the studio hired one Tim Story to direct this ambitious project and one has to wonder how he was given the opportunity because his previous efforts (like the wretched 'Taxi' and the low budget 'Barbershop') hardly makes one think that he can handle something this size. It's noticeable right from the get-go that Story is in over his head but what I think is even more clear is that this film lacks any type of star power whatsoever. I'm not trying to insult any of the actors because I think their all good performers but is there really anyone in this cast that can put butts in theater seats? The actor who does come off best is Chiklis as The Thing who's role is understandable because his appearance is so drastically changed that he loses his fiancé. But the film still wants the viewers to think that The Thing would be sitting in a coffee shop by himself without drawing any attention or crowds and that Ben's fiancé would casually walk outside in Brooklyn wearing nothing but a nightie! My biggest complaint with this film comes from the casting of McMahon as Von Doom and it's because he's so damn soft spoken! He wears what looks like a Darth Vader rental and is supposed to be trying to kill people and take over the world but all I could think of when I watched his character was 'COULD YOU PLEASE SPEAK UP'. Instead of Dr. Doom maybe his nickname should be Mr. Lowkey because I can't think of one scene where he raises his voice. While superior films like 'Batman Begins' and 'Spider-Man 2' take their time with character development and showing the effects of having an alter-ego this effort merely (and barely) touches on those issues. This film suffers from an inexperienced director and a weak script and doesn't possess actors in it's cast to make anyone take notice so what audiences are left with is an effort that looks like it was rushed into theaters to make it's summer release date.",4,5,10,14 August 2005
Sin City," Sin City is both faithful and brilliant
","It would be very easy to describe Sin City as an exercise in style but the truth is that this is one of those films that's really indescribable, although brilliantly so. Three of Frank Miller's graphic stories are brought to the screen and the first involves a hardened detective named Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who saves an 11 year old girl named Nancy (Makenzie Vega) from Roark Jr. (Nick Stahl) who's a pedophile but has family connections in both politics and religion.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Hartigan ends up in jail for 8 years but when he gets out he finds Nancy (Jessica Alba) who's now a dancer in a hole in the wall called Kadie's and he accidentally leads Yellow Bastard (Stahl again) to her.The second story involves a deformed brute and ex-con named Marv (Mickey Rourke) who wakes up next to a dead hooker and realizes out that he's being framed. Marv meets the dead hookers twin sister and he figures out that her death has to do with a silent nerd named Kevin (Elijah Wood) who's a cannibal but is protected by Cardinal Roark (Rutger Hauer) who's a family member.Story number 3 has a semi decent hooligan named Dwight (Clive Owen) dating a waitress from Kadie's named Shellie (Brittany Murphy) but her old boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) refuses to let her go. Dwight follows him to Old Town where the hookers live but Jackie Boy gets himself killed which puts things in chaos because the police and organized crime might want to take over the area since Jackie Boy is a cop!This is credited with having 3 directors but the truth of the matter is that Sin City is a Robert Rodriguez film from start to finish. Not only is he the main director but he also did the cinematography with HD cameras and the editing as well. Frank Miller is given credit because he was on the set every day overseeing everything and the entire look of the film comes from his comics and storyboards. Quentin Tarantino directed one scene in the film (as a favor to his friend Rodriguez) and it's the one involving Owen driving to the tar pits and having a conversation with the head of Del Toro. The cinematography is in black and white except with a few splashes of other colors for artistic reasons and one of the more interesting choices Rodriguez made was with all the bloodshed that occurs there is no red blood shown and the color white is used instead. What makes this film truly special (for me, anyway) is the story involving Rourke as the deformed brute called Marv and even though he's hidden under a ton of make-up Rourke delivers one of his most memorable performances to date. With Miller's brutally edgy characterization and Rodriguez's visual flair Rourke is given all the ingredients to bring this character to life on screen and he does it with a gusto that audiences haven't seen from him in years. The script does an admirable job of giving insights into his character to the point that the viewer actually starts to understand him such as his gratitude to the hooker Goldie (Jaime King) for her kindness but it also delves deeper into his psyche that he mentions that he worries about becoming a homicidal maniac. Quite simply the character Marv is one of the toughest SOB's ever captured on film! The other actors that appear in the film are all well cast as well from Willis, Owen, Alba, Wood, Del Toro, and also Rosario Dawson, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Alexis Bledel. This is a modern film noir set in one of those alternate universes where we see old cars and characters talking about 'dames' but we also see modern devices such as cell phones and helicopters and Sin City at times reminds viewers of Gotham City. Some may find the violence too much for their taste but I was enthralled by practically every minute of this film and the great news is that there are already plans to bring more of these dark stories to the screen.",8,1,3,1 May 2005
Gangs of New York," Bloody, Brawling Epic.
","I really do admire this film but I didn't love it. It's so impressive looking and Martin Scorsese filmed it in Italy at the legendary Cinecittia Studios and the 'Making Of' will probably be more interesting than the film itself. Daniel Day Lewis as Bill saves the film for me, his performance really dominates the film and he should get an Oscar nomination for it. Leonardo DiCaprio is fine but I don't think he's very memorable. Cameron Diaz added nothing to the film and is cast just to be 'The Girl'. I think the main flaw in the film is that Scorsese throws to much into the script with draft rioting, race wars, crooked politicians, people revolting against the abolition of slavery, the war, the army brought in to fight the rioters, war between the classes. There is so much going on that the final half hour becomes chaotic and the main story between Dicaprio and Lewis almost becomes a side story and gets swamped. But I do recommend this film highly mainly for the incredible sets that were built and of course for the performance of Lewis. The film also reminds us of an ugly but important part of our history. Story is flawed but its still an impressive epic.",7,0,0,22 December 2002
True Romance," True Romance is pure fun
","There are some films that you gladly forget about common sense and logic and just sit back to enjoy the energy of what your watching. Story is about Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) who works in a comic book store and watches kung-fu films and while sitting in a movie theater one night he meets Alabama (Patricia Arquette). They hit it off and go back to his place where after some lovemaking he finds out that she is a hooker that was hired by his boss but she really likes him and vows to give up prostitution. They get married and Clarence decides to go get her belongings from her pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman) but after a bloody altercation Drexl and his hired thugs are killed and Clarence grabs a suitcase and runs out. At home they discover millions of dollars in cocaine stashed in the case so they decide to go to California and look up his friend Dick (Michael Rapaport).*****SPOILER ALERT*****
 They arrive and Dick gets them a deal to sell the cocaine to a famous film producer for 200,000 dollars but the cops find out about it and want to make the bust but Italian gangsters are hot on Clarence's and Alabama's trail.This film was directed by Tony Scott who also directed 'Top Gun' and he has shown good skill at directing action films that keep a steady and exciting pace. But the films real flavor isn't necessarily in the action but in Quentin Tarantino's wonderful script and dialogue. Even when the film slows down and there is no action taking place you're still enthralled by the words spoken by the actors and there is a truly memorable scene involving Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. The fact that these two terrific actors are interacting in a film was exciting enough but the scene between them is written so splendidly that it has become a classic. Slater is well cast as the hot headed but reckless Clarence and I've always been a big fan of Arquette. They have good chemistry together and this helps the film as we watch this story unfold. The cast is top notch and along with the main leads you can see Brad Pitt, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L. Jackson, Saul Rubinek, Conchata Ferrell, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore and Ed Lauter. Also, Val Kilmer pops up from time to time as the ghost of Elvis that mentors Clarence in his actions. I personally could have done without the whole Elvis/Ghost part of the story but this is just nit picking because this is a whole lot of fun to watch. This has more than it's share of violence but this film is highly stylized and generates an abundant of energy that never lets up.",7,1,3,27 January 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," Exciting sequel makes you crave for more in this well made franchise
","I'm usually not one that looks forward to movie franchises but this sequel does a rare thing in that it makes the viewer hope that they keep the character active through more films. This is the second installment and it picks up where the first film left off with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) living in Goa, India but one day Jason notices a stranger in town and instantly suspects him of being an agent which leads to a chase where Marie dies after their car crashes off a bridge and lands in the river. Jason heads to Berlin and learns that he has been framed in the murder of another agent even though he was in India at the time.*****SPOILER ALERT*****A CIA agent named Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) heads the case but when she questions Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) who headed the project that trained Jason she gets lots of flack from him. Jason starts a cat and mouse game with the CIA and various local authorities and ultimately he goes to Moscow to find the agent that killed Marie but back at the CIA Pamela doesn't know that it's actually Ward who is framing him.This film is directed by Paul Greengrass who is slowly becoming recognized as one of the more talented directors to emerge in the last few years and 'Bloody Sunday' opened a lot of eyes to him. There are many reasons why this film (And the first) works so well and first is the way Bourne can get out of seemingly impossible situations either with hand to hand combat or through incredible ingenuity. But for me the real reason that these films stand apart is the casting of Damon as Bourne. Damon doesn't really have any quick one liners like Bruce Willis in 'Die Hard' but instead he's a brooder that is trying to remember whether he's responsible for the deaths of two people in a hotel room. There's a terrific car chase scene towards the end of the film that is one of the better ones in the last ten years or so and it helps punctuate the fact that this is a very well made and exciting film. My only complaint comes from the editing as I thought there were to many quick cuts where if you blinked you might miss three separate shots but Greengrass does do a good job keeping the flow of the film moving at a nice pace even with all the action and scenic locations. I do have one suggestion to keep this franchise fresh (As long as Robert Ludlum keeps writing them) and it's to have other well known directors all take a turn directing one film like what they've done with the 'Harry Potter' series. Can you imagine directors like Ridley Scott, Michael Mann, and William Friedkin all having a turn with a Bourne story? This concept will give each film it's own distinction with the hope that they won't just become tiresome sequels. I hope Hollywood is listening!",7,1,4,7 September 2004
Hustle & Flow," Breakout role for Howard
","Often an actor will kick around Hollywood without getting the awards or accolades and be one of those recognizable faces that pop up in films (Robert Duvall, Paul Giamatti) but every once in a while things can change in just one year with just the right role and performance that opens everyone's eyes. Story is about DJay (Terrence Howard) who's a smalltime Memphis dealer and pimp but hates what he's doing and dreams of doing something else in life and one day gets the idea of becoming a rap artist. Djay runs into an old friend named Key (Anthony Anderson) and learns that he's a sound engineer which gives him the idea of asking for his help to make a demo tape so that he can give a copy to a rapper named Skinny Black (Ludacris) whom DJay knew years earlier.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Nola (Taryn Manning) is DJay's cash cow but she also hates what she's doing but he still needs her to use her services in order to make money to finance the recording of his tape. While DJay writes the lyrics for his songs Key has his friend Shelby (DJ Qualls) help mix the music and they also enlist the help of DJay's pregnant girlfriend Shug (Taraji P. Henson) who is used for backup vocalization. Once the demo tape is finished DJay heads to a local bar (run by Isaac Hayes) where Skinny Black is having a party but after handing him his tape things go horribly wrong and DJay ends up in the custody of the police.This is only the second feature for writer/director Craig Brewer and immediately his script sucks the audience in with the very first shot of DJay talking to Nola about his thoughts of not only about being a man but one's opportunities in life. Howard's performance is revolutionary and with his James Brown-like hair his character DJay is shown as a man who clearly knows that he can't be a pimp forever and Howard perfectly channels this man's desperation and focus in trying to change his life. Howard has been a respected character actor for over 10 years and his face had become pretty familiar for audiences but this is the year that should not only change his career but also the way others will look at him in terms of his talent. Earlier this year Howard gave another solid performance in 'Crash' and 2005 seems to be his breakout year and will hopefully lead him to being a leading man in other interesting films because he's one of those actor's that has paid his dues to get to this spot. This film also boasts some good supporting roles with Manning and Henson standing out as the women in DJay's life and it's time for some filmmaker to give Manning a bigger and well written part. I found her character a tad under written but she does have one strong scene where she admits how much she hates prostituting herself and one can't help but think her character deserved more to do. While I can't say that this film is truly realistic (although it's more relevant than the Eminem myth '8 Mile') it still captures the look of the seedy side of Memphis perfectly and shows DJay for all of his flaws like taking his whores money and throwing out one of his girlfriends (with his own child!) into the street. This is one of those low budget films that not only gives a young director the opportunity to show he's a filmmaker to watch but it also gives an actor like Howard (who for years has been under-appreciated) the role of a lifetime and show that he's ready to establish himself.",7,0,0,4 August 2005
Cinderella Man," Braddock's underdog story receives good treatment by Howard
","Studios have made more than their share of films dealing with the sport of boxing with arguably the best being 'Fat City', 'Rocky', 'Million Dollar Baby', 'The Set-Up', and 'Somebody Up There Likes Me' and they each bring their own special twist to the genre but while I'm not convinced that this film is as good as those it's still an incredibly well made effort that deserves to be mentioned along side them. This is the true story of the Depression era boxer Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) who struggled like millions of others to put food on the table for his family and tries to make money by working shifts at the docks in Hoboken, New Jersey. Braddock started his boxing career pretty well but once the crash hit he and his family were reduced to living in squalor with no heat and very little to eat.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Braddock is also unable to get a fight after breaking his right hand numerous times and even has his license revoked by the commission after sub-par efforts. Braddock is supported greatly by his devoted wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) who would do anything for her husband except watch or listen to one of his fights. One day out of the blue his manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) gets him a big fight at the Garden with a ranked contender and surprises everyone by winning it! This leads to more important bouts with good fighters which he also wins and it leads to a title shot with the champ Max Baer (Craig Bierko) who is responsible for the deaths of two of his opponents.Director Ron Howard is technically as good as any filmmaker working today but his vulnerability is that his films can cross the line into sappiness and become emotionally obvious but here I think it works to his (and our) advantage because he taps into the brave and honest struggles of a working class hero. Braddock wasn't exactly a complicated man but his career as a boxer went up and down and up again with everything that takes place in the middle helping to show audiences what he was made of in terms of being a man and a father. Crowe in real life can be a rugged character but one of his best virtues as an actor is that he can show tremendous passion and tenderness in his performances and this quality has always reminded me of Burt Lancaster who was extremely manly and thoughtful at the same time. Being a boxing fan myself my main complaint in the story is the portrayal of Max Baer who is shown as a real brute but in real life he was really nothing like that but my guess is that Howard really wanted audiences to have a strong reason to root for Braddock's success not just in terms of earning money but to try and not get killed! Giamatti can credit his performance to the great boxing trainer Angelo Dundee (who appears in the film) and his speeches during the film are designed to inspire Braddock and help make him rise above the odds and he's believable in the role as he shows both tenacity for his profession and the personal sacrifices he makes to help his boxer and friend. Many have said that this is Howard's best film to date but I think that's completely false when you think of previous efforts like 'Apollo 13' and 'A Beautiful Mind' but make no bones about it, this is a well made and acted film that does the correct thing by just being (for the most part) honest in it's portrayal.",7,0,2,26 June 2005
Dodgeball," Harmless comedy is just too predictable
","I'm not trying to convince anyone who saw this that they viewed a bad film because nothing is more subjective than comedy and I do believe that there are some solid laughs found here but many of the subplots in this story are just so obvious and predictable. Story is about Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) who manages a small and rundown gym called 'Average Joe's' but with his pathetic group of members he doesn't make much money and now the bank needs $50,000 or they're going to take it away from him.*****SPOILER ALERT***** White Goodman (Ben Stiller) runs a very successful gym also and he won't stop at anything to get his hands on Peter's and he even agree's to give him more than $50,000 but that doesn't convince Peter to sell. Peter is convinced by his members that they should join the Dodgeball League and try and win the championship prize in Las Vegas but what finally spurns him on to the idea is the help from Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) who is a dodgeball teacher and Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) who works for the bank.This film is directed by newcomer Rawson Marshall Thurber who benefits from the opportunity to work with a cast that has been in several goofy comedies reminiscent of this and they together make this film work on several levels. The story is slapstick with so many jokes and humorous situations tossed in that you can make a case that it resembles the 'Airplane' films but the main problem I had with this is the predictability of most of the situations and it's characters. Was is really surprising to see the one nerdy character who wanted to be a cheerleader end up with the hot chick from his school? Did anyone believe Taylor's character would be attracted to Vaughn and that she would even get involved with dodgeball? Sure, I'm nit-picking but these were such glaring aspects of the story that it's shocking to me that the makers of this film don't realize how cheesy they are and just change it. If you love Stiller and his over the top comedies than you'll no doubt enjoy this effort but for me I found too many parts of the film cartoonish to allow myself to admit this as a guilty pleasure.",4,0,1,12 February 2005
