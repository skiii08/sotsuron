Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," without doubt......the worst star wars film.
","For me, this is the most boring and annoying of the entire Star Wars Saga.The only highlight of The Phantom Menace is the 'Duel Of The Fates' between Obi Wan Kenobi, Qui Gonn Jinn and Darth Maul, plus it was a bad error to kill off Darth Maul at the end, because his character was the most enigmatic and interesting in the whole film.Jake Lloyd is a bitter disappointment as Anakin Skywalker. Why did he have to be a little ten year old brat who needed a slap? Why did he have such a stupid, stupid pudding bowl hairstyle? The climatic dogfight was ruined by Lloyd's over the top acting in that cockpit with R2. I hated him, and yet this is supposed to be the most intriguing character. Woeful.Yes, the special effects are impressive. But the special effects in Jaws 2 were 'impressive' as well. The original Star Wars Trilogy had a sense of awe and wonder that made you smile, without the need for special effects...in...every...single...scene...and set-piece. You get the impression that because of so much computer generated effects in this 'first' chapter, you are watching an alternative version of Shrek, nothing 'feels' real.I'm making it official in my commentary here. Jar Jar Binks should be tied to a giant bonfire the way Oliver Reed's priest was in Ken Russell's The Devils and slowly burned to death....one of the most irritating characters conceived in the history of motion pictures...George Lucas states in the DVD commentary that Binks is the 'key' in all of this. Which showed how out of touch he was with his fan-base and cinema audiences in general.Most of the cast are woeful. Ewan Macgregor is like a Gerry Anderson puppet in this and sounds like an effeminate rent-boy. He is only marginally better in Attack Of The Clones. Natalie Portman is beautiful looking as she usually is. But that is it. Liam Neeson, as the Jedi Master Qui Gonn brings a decent conviction to his role even if he is bemused talking to Jar Jar Binks most of the time.John Williams traditional score is majestic and commanding as always, so no grumbles or problems there then....except for the daft 'parade' ending on Naboo, when Boss Nass is handed some sort of glowing marble from Queen Amidala there is some kind of child like chanting soundtrack that will make anyone over the age of ten cringe. A screaming disappointment from start to finish.",4,0,1,22 July 2006
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Should have been re-released in cinemas last year!
","Raiders Of The Lost Ark is an extraordinary action adventure film. It will probably never be bettered. The opening sequence is gripping and the introduction of Doctor Henry 'Indiana' Jones is the best since James Bond's character in Doctor No. Harrison Ford is sensational in this film, this is quite simply the best action hero he has ever played. I love his Fedora hat, leather jacket and cracking bull whip.Raiders from start to finish produces a ton of classic scenes, no one will forget the classic switch of the bag of sand for the Hovito Idol, or the Bar room brawl/gunfight in Nepal...and what about the locations and the set pieces! No CGI desert backgrounds here, just the glorious enjoyment of huge Nazi excavation sites to unearth the enchanting but mysterious power that is The Ark Of The Covenant. The fight scene between Indy and the huge German soldier underneath a rotating Nazi plane is one of the best fight sequences I've ever seen, plus the Truck chase in the desert with Indy on horseback is a joy to behold.The script is excellent. Lawerence Kasdan deserves a special mention for producing good memorable dialogue. The supporting cast are superb, Karen Allen is extremely attractive as the feisty Marion Ravenwood, even though she has a tough exterior (demonstrated by that classic punch to Indy's face) She somehow hinted in the following scene that she had been vulnerable when she was first involved with Jones and wasn't as tough. Paul Freeman is terrific as Belloq, i think that he plays him with a sinister charm and has some wonderful dialogue 'Your going to give mercenaries a bad name!' Steven Spielberg's direction is the same magic he weaved with both Jaws and Close Encounters, this was a man who wanted to make a great memorable picture during production in 1980 and he has stated himself that it is the one film that he can look back on and watch with an audience or his own children and truthfully admit to enjoying it as much as anyone else. All power and credit to Mr George Lucas as well, his ideas and scenarios at the time were about how to create special effects that lifted a scene and blew an audience away (like the Ark's power unleashed at the climax) and not about how to make an empty green screen into a CGI cartoon.Special honorary mention to the great John Williams. Sir, your film score for this movie is absolutely stunning and glorious. Indy's theme is instantly recognised whenever it plays. It is one of the most famous soundtracks for a film character in Movie history...i salute you Mr Williams, you are a genius!Raiders Of The Lost Ark is one of the greatest Action Adventure films ever made...to be honest it really is the best adventure film. Welcome to the world of Indiana Jones!",10,2,4,23 May 2008
United 93," We should all see this film.....if only to witness courage and bravery.
","United 93 is not a Hollywood Glamour thriller portraying the events of September 11th 2001 like a daft blockbuster in the style of Armageddon or Independence Day.The events of that day are well depicted in a Documentary style 'as it happened' mentality, as if the audience or viewer is an observer at every location where things occurred that terrible day.Kudos then to Paul Greengrass for professional handling of a very sensitive moment in our history. Some people have cried out 'Too Soon!' But after i viewed this film on DVD, the message could not be simpler: The passengers of United 93 fought back and showed courage and bravery, knowing only too well that they faced inevitable doom.After viewing this in my home, i had a lump in my throat.I don't think i could have handled this in the Cinema.But you must see United 93, and not for entertainment. How could it be? You must see it to remember those brave and courageous passengers who teamed up to Face off an Evil that is still very much alive in our times.A devastating and brilliant dramatisation.Ten Out Of Ten.",10,0,1,28 October 2006
Star Trek," I hate this movie. I hate everything about it.
","This film does to Star Trek what Superman Returns does to the 1978 Richard Donner Classic. It tries to capture the magic of the original movies which it could never do. Chris Pine is like Paul Walker...like a live action man figure, they might as well have cast David Beckham in the most important role. All the special effects are complete CGI and phoney...no brilliant model work or optical effects here, this movie is strictly for the X box generation.You know, i think i hate the makers of this film more than the finished product...and if you HAVE to make Star Trek frigging 2 (!!) Then at least come up with a half decent bad guy and DO NOT bring back Khan OK? He died just before Reliant exploded. Don't be Lazy.You can stick this up your Tan Track Paramount, along with Indy IV.",1,1,7,21 May 2009
The Beach," Worst movie mistake, make characters we couldn't give a stuff about
","I saw this almost a decade ago on the big screen. A decade ago Leonardo Decaprio still had a lot to prove despite finding teen pin up status as the doomed peasant in Titanic and as one of the star crossed lovers in Romeo and Juliet. He proved he was capable of making a film that wasn't really any good at all.Watching Tilda Swindon rave to Yeke Yeke was downright embarrassing. The scene where Leo's character Richard runs through the jungle in computer game style animation almost destroys the effort to keep taking the film seriously.Robert Carlyle gets to do an impression of a Glaswegian Junkie/alcoholic screaming his head off in a Thailand hotel corridor, smokes a joint with Leo boy and is seen later in a really stupid dream sequence (in the trailer, that said sequence is sold to the audience as an action segment with Carlyle waving a gun around and shouting at a scared Richard, so its a bit of a cheat)then he is never seen again.The french actress was pretty and her in the ocean 'sex' scene had all the glamour of a Bounty advert. This film bored me to tears. Avoid.",3,3,5,11 September 2009
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Great 'final chapter', but too much attention on the Ewoks...
","This was it. The final battle. The exciting build up to the ending that we had all been waiting for after the Empire Stikes Back, questions to be asked that were finally answered: Will Han Solo be rescued from Jabba the Hutt? Will Luke Skywalker face Darth Vader a second time?Who is the mysterious Emperor? And what will be the final outcome between the Rebellion and the Imperial Forces? When i saw the film at the Odeon Cinema in the summer of 1983 as a boy i thought it was a brilliant ending for the Star Wars Trilogy, now that i'm older and wiser i can see that 'Episode Six' is full of half-baked acting, a kind of 'Let's get this movie over with i'm fed up' attitude from Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, moments that are mean't to be moving (like Yoda's death Scene) drag on forever and many more problems.One of the flaws is the lack of threat from Darth Vader, so imposing and powerful in The Empire Strikes Back, here he is reduced in screen time and only really comes alive again during the three way confrontation on the Death Star with Luke and the Emperor, which in my own opinion is the best part in the entire film.Also the Death Star space battle with the rebel fighters is brilliant as well, but i will be damned if i like those stupid Ewoks, which were invented to find an audience that loved the Muppet Show.George Lucas should have stuck to his original concept of Chewbacca's race: the Wookies. Instead he has silly little furry care bears. Think about it! legions of Stormtroopers versus marauding Wookies and laser blasting Rebels on Endor? Talk about lost potential!Return of the Jedi also has a terrible bad acting exchange of dialogue moment between Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams.It occurs just before Solo leaves for Endor he says 'Look i want you to take her' meaning the Millennium Falcon, Lando replies 'Don't worry Buddy, she won't get a scratch!' Ford turns away trying to express uncertainty at William's promise and almost stammers 'I gotcha promise now? Not a scratch right?' William's moos like a cow by exclaiming 'WOOUULD YOUUU GET GOOINNG YA PIRATE?'It looks like they used a rehearsed take on the actors rather than try to make it more convincing.That is evidence that there was a lack of conviction on this film, unlike The Empire Strikes Back where you see great performances as well as bang for your buck.But still, Return of the Jedi is a satisfying conclusion if not on a par with a New Hope and Empire to the trilogy.It is ten billion times better than the Phantom Menace.",10,0,0,31 August 2004
Pan's Labyrinth," Best fantasy drama in a long time
","This is an excellent fantasy drama set during the fascist wars of 1944 Spain, in which a young girl comes into contact with fairies from another World and is given a series of Tasks to perform. However, danger lurks in the form of her dangerous stepfather general, an evil man who cares only about power and the prevailing of a New Fascist Order in Spain.Having seen the film on DVD only last night, i can't remember the names of the actors and actresses playing the main roles, but i will tell you that Pan's Labyrinth is one of the best fantasy fairy tales I've seen in a long time. The set pieces are excellent, the gruesome special effects are fantastic and the cast are superb.See it with your eyes open and your mind clear, and you will enjoy a great story!",10,3,6,3 April 2007
Alien," A science fiction horror masterpiece classic.
","Alien is perfect from start to finish. The opening title sequence is one of the creepiest and effective in modern cinema. Jerry Goldsmith's music score is chillingly vibrant throughout the film's duration.The cast are perfectly suited to their roles. Sigourney Weaver excels as Flight officer Ripley, showing the character to be tough and by the book. (Like telling her captain 24 hours for quarantine). Its easy to see why this film made her a star. The atmosphere, set design and special effects were so new when this film was released in 1979, that audiences worldwide were seeing something that they had never saw before (just like George Luca's earlier Star Wars)in fact when i saw the film on its 'Director's cut' cinema release in November 2003, i was in awe of the fact that the film has not dated at all...it is utterly timeless, and will probably stand the test of time for years to come.Special mention must go to Ian Holm as the science officer Ash. His portrayal of this character is perfect. I won't spoil it for you dear readers who have not seen this classic, but Holm is a revelation here (as is his character) and you will remember his part in this film (as well as the infamous dinner table sequence). Alien is the best science fiction horror film ever. It has not been bettered and its been ripped off countless times: Deepstar Six, Leviathan, Event Horizon and Sunshine come to mind. You cannot beat perfection.",10,0,1,10 March 2008
Lost in Translation," Scarlett Johansson is overrated. Bill Murray is depressing.
","Lost In Translation is about an actor (Bill Murray) who arrives in Tokyo to film an advert for Whisky. At his swanky hotel, he meets a young woman called Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and over the duration of this movie bemoan how dull and tedious their lives are.And how right they are. Bill Murray has done much better than this in other films like Mad Dog And Glory and Ghostbusters, roles where he had a likable funny charisma. Here, he sleepwalks around playing the actor Bob Harris like a former shadow of himself, perhaps this is the point, to show how TIRED he is of life.....yawn.Then there is Scarlett Johansson. A very pretty and attractive model who walks around certain places in Tokyo exploring the culture with a big dumb look on her face while her director husband is away filming on location. Why did she win all this praise for this role? Has she been in a box office smash since? The Island anyone? There's nothing really badly made on a film making note with Lost In Translation, it has a not bad soundtrack and a nice opening shot of Scarlett Johansson's butt over the titles, but apart from that there's not anything terribly interesting going on.Dull as ditch water.....three out of ten.",3,4,9,31 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars is well and truly finished as far as cinematic blockbusters go.
","Once again, JJ Abrams hailed as a 'visionary director' proves hes nothing of the sort. Instead he conjures up a truly dismal plot featuring the return of Palpatine 'calling' from somewhere in the galaxy who is planning yet another attempt to rule the galaxy.
It turns out that it was Darth Sidious himself who was behind 'The First Order' and is the creator of 'Snoke' the villain from the first two films. Like, wow! Im completely blown away with this revelation! Anyway Palpatine has been building a new secret enormous space armada of star destroyers to rid the rebellion OOPS, i mean 'The Resistance' on a mysterious planet.
Our 'heroes' the boring Rey, the idiotic Finn and the dullard Han Solo wannabe Poe Dameron are on Palpatine's trail to finish him off forever. Oh, and Rey is Palpatine's granddaughter. Hows that for a shift from the narrative of The Last Jedi, a film just as bad as this one? Can you sense the boredom from me as i type this review? i have absolutely no excitement for Star Wars anymore. I cant even be bothered to properly conclude this review.
Let me finish by saying that the corporation known as Disney need to badly find someone who understands the Star Wars mythos, the fantasy, the adventure etc. someone who has a true vision of what could be brought to the screen and not only sell billions in merchandise but also create GREAT NEW FILMS.
Star Wars is Dead.
Only The Original Trilogy is special.",1,6,9,22 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Action and thrills intermixed with overlong love boredom...
","Set ten years after the events of The Phantom Menace, Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker investigate an assassination attempt on senator Padme Amidala's life, and have various adventures, while the Sith lords plot the rising of a 'clone' army.Is this an improvement on The Phantom Menace? Well, it has the same look and feel as the first episode, but thankfully Jar Jar Binks is kept to the minimum this time. That is a good start.The casting of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker was a good choice. The young actor does well having to wrestle with terrible dialogue when he makes his character's feelings plain to Padme while guarding her on Naboo. Natalie Portman is beautiful looking again. And that is it. Their love relationship is aimed at the mentality of seven year old silly little girls that will see Hayden's Anakin as a pin-up and not the disturbed Jedi warrior hes meant to be. Irvin Kershner got it so right with Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford's characters in The Empire Strikes Back. Their relationship started as people who didn't take to each other right away. They argued and traded insults, it worked. Here it clangs badly.Ewan Macgregor is slightly better as Obi-Wan Kenobi than he was before. One of my favourite scenes is where he interrupts a Jedi class under Yoda's instruction, and together with the help of the young lings, they solve a missing planet puzzle. No action or thrills here, just a lovely moment.The Duel Of The Fates this time is with Christopher Lee's Count Dooku. What a stupid name for a fallen Jedi/Sith Lord! I prefer his Sith alias Darth Tyrannus. His light sabre battle with Anakin and Obi-Wan is ruined by silly actors' face close ups and flashy neon lighting. Crap. The rematch at the start of Revenge Of The Sith between them is far better.Attack Of The Clones is a minor improvement on The Phantom Menace, pertaining more to the action and thrills rather than the computer generated effects which sadly dominated the prequel trilogy throughout.",6,1,2,29 July 2006
The Godfather: Part II," The best sequel ever made.
","You take THAT director, THAT photographer, THAT production designer and THOSE actors, make a massive richly detailed follow up telling two stories in the one film which runs at 200 minutes and you have the greatest sequel of all time (along with the empire strikes back).Part II tells how the Corleones have progressed in the year 1958,with Michael Corleone now truly in command of his empire at lake Tahoe in Nevada, he is now in business with a dangerous Jewish gangster called Hyman Roth who is secretly in partnership with Michael's weak-willed brother Fredo in an attempt to assassinate Michael and pull off a deal that involves Cuba and gambling casinos in las Vegas.When Michael learns he has been betrayed, he orders his brother's death and starts issuing threats to relatives and friends alike, slowly becoming warped and paranoid, Michael's face is ravaged and sullen, his eyes are as dark and lifeless as his father's were in part I, thus the circle is complete. like father...like son.Not only do we learn of Michael's Ascension as emperor of the Corleones but we are shown how the young Don Vito Corleone first came to power in many flashback scenes. A special mention must go to Robert De Niro for his turn as young Vito speaking all his lines in Sicilian dialogue, you really believe this is Don Vito as a young man in 1917 New York city.The senate hearings on organised crime are brilliantly staged and interesting with Michael's denial on ever running the 'biggest criminal organisation' in the USA. I could go on and on about this amazing film but i will end it on saying that the godfather part II is every bit as majestic and tragically mesmerising as the original.ten out of ten.",10,1,4,26 March 2004
Léon: The Professional," Stylish action thriller with superb character performances.
","What can i say about this film that hasn't been said already? No matter what Hollywood blockbuster Jean Reno stars in, EVERYONE who has seen Leon will probably agree that this is the character he will be remembered for. An excellent performance of physical strength and brutality masking a terrible past of loss, pain and isolation.Natalie Portman as Matilda. Forget the Star Wars movies. THIS is the film that made her. Every film she has starred in since Leon, be it good or bad, she is always watchable and never disappoints. She is also one of the most gorgeous actresses thats ever lived.Gary Oldman's Norman Stansfield does for this film what Darth Vader did for Star Wars. An excellent OTT performance that stays in the mind long after the film has concluded.Just recently, i saw 'Leon:The Professional' on DVD, and it makes a classic film ten times darker and EVEN BETTER. 10/10",10,3,6,25 March 2006
The Thing," A horrifying gory Masterpiece!
","A brilliant horror film. Utterly gruesome and very scary too. The Thing is a remake from John Carpenter, but please, do not let that put you off this film. It is simply brilliant. The start of the film has the alien's spacecraft hurtling towards the Earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the film's title in amazing shining white and blue stating 'THE THING'. One of the best opening credits for a horror film ever.The cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their Station in Antartica is visually impressive on DVD widescreen. It must have been great in the cinema. I regret not seeing this on the big screen.Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base. All the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected. My favourite scene in the whole film has to be when Macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection, it is tense, scary and finally spectacular. I love it because its funny as well.Special mention must go to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself. If he didn't get an Oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have. This is also debatable as to whether this is John Carpenter's greatest film...its certainly a gruesome masterpiece.Wait for a cold winter night. Get some Budweiser from the fridge. Sit down and watch The Thing, a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting shape changing towers of gore and slime.Utterly brilliant.Ten Out Of Ten.",10,1,2,7 November 2006
The Machinist," Haunting....tragic tale of guilt and terrible consequence.....
","Christian Bale gives a great performance as Trevor Reznik, a man slowly wasting away on Insomnia and a secret terrible guilt from times past. He works as a Machinist at an Industrial Plant in Los Angeles.He is a walking skeleton, looking like a Concentration Camp Survivor and a former shadow of his self in personality and charisma. This film cleverly depicts his slow road to insanity and possible salvation and finally delivers the tragic incident that led him to the state he has fallen to.I'm not going to spoil it for you, see the film. If you like films like The Conversation, Five Easy Pieces, The Ninth Configuration or even Taxi Driver you will be intrigued by this haunting gem.Eight Out Of Ten.",8,2,3,7 October 2006
Aliens," Not only a brilliant sequel, but a classic horror thriller on its own.
","Aliens is a brilliant sequel to a masterpiece. AND it is a masterpiece on its own right. This is a film where the director James Cameron cared for the story, characters, special effects, thrills and scares like his life depended on it. It starts perfectly, just like the original, countering on the small escape shuttle from the Nostromo after 57 years have passed...one of the things that Cameron excelled on was his faithfulness to link reminders of the first film i.e. the view-screen with the dead Nostromo crew's profiles highlighted at the Board meeting between Ripley and the company executives, and the lecture she gives the marines about the crew member Kane and what happened...superb. Aliens is also action packed once the marines encounter the dreaded creatures at their lair in the sub station, the audience are gripped until the very end.The performances are top class as well. Another excellent turn from Sigourney Weaver. Michael Biehn is great as Dwayne Hicks. Bill Paxton was superb and funny as Hudson. Jeanette Goldstein rocked as Vasquez, her bandanna wardrobe reminded me of Robert Shaw's Quint in Jaws. And like that shark classic, this film is a winner because you end up caring about the characters and hope that they escape from the terrible menace they face.Alien is a Masterpiece. Well, that goes twice for Aliens, one of the greatest sequels and greatest horror science fiction movies ever made.",10,3,5,13 March 2008
The Exorcist," A unique horror chiller
","Most of this film's strength is its chilling atmosphere from start to finish. From northern Iraq to Georgetown this barely lets up.The Exorcist is tagged as a film about The Devil possessing a little girl, but its unnerving when The Priest (an excellent Jason Miller) doesn't really know just what kind of entity that dominates Reagan and doubts his own Faith even more.The special effects are still gruesome, the shocks still shock and the face of Pazuzu flashing vividly in Karra's dream sequence with his mother coming out the subway is still really scary and frightening.A classic horror film for all time.",10,0,1,10 February 2009
Quantum of Solace," Terrific action packed thriller. Daniel Craig IS......better than George Lazenby!
","This sequel to Casino Royale is action packed brilliance from start to finish. Okay, i'm not a fan of Daniel Craig as James bond but he makes a great action hero in the sense of Jason Bourne or even Keanu Reeve's character in the blockbuster Speed.For a new generation i guess, Daniel Craig IS James Bond. Pretty soon, you'll be naming your favourite actors to play the role the same way you name your favourite Tennis players. Guess that makes me a Connery and Moore fan. I believe its to do in the years you grew up in and the first actor you saw in the role which shapes your taste. Anyway, the film keeps you glued to the screen, Craig is playing straight action man all the way, little room is left for any character portrayal but who cares? Hes great in all his fight scenes and they are awesome.The babe who plays Camille is gorgeous. One of the most beautiful women to grace the screen (well, aren't most of the Bond girls?) There are only two things wrong with this 007 adventure, and that is another crap title song that doesn't go with the theme of the movie. I wish John Barry would come back, Simon Arnold as a composer for the Bond films seems to make all his soundtracks (even the Brosnan episodes) all the same.The other problem is no menacing threat of a henchman. No Red Grant type cold killer. No Oddjob oddity. Instead we get an awful campy, skinny bowl-cut assistant to the villain who is about as threatening as Stewie from Family Guy. I mean what was the deal with that bowl-cut? I kept thinking it was a special wig where he kept a secret weapon, but hey! Thats Moonraker territory right?Oh Yes! Daniel Craig doesn't go heavy on his pout (like he did in Casino Royale!) Surely other people must have noticed this? glad to see you listening Daniel, and yes you ARE getting better in the role!8 out of 10",8,3,4,8 November 2008
Independence Day," A movie where the trailers turned out to be better than the feature.
","I saw Independence Day twice in the cinema during the summer of 1996. The first time, i thought it was action packed, with stunning special effects with fantastic set pieces like New York and Washington D.C. being blown to pieces by the invading aliens. Then i had to see it again. This time i went with some friends.When i walked out after the second showing i realised that the film was disaster rubbish with sit com comedy dominating the entire feature. The proof is in the daft stereotypes. Jeff Goldblum takes the film seriously for about five minutes (during the arrival of the massive ships over the New York skyline) after that as far as Goldblum's concerned its Laurel and Hardy time with Will Smith's fighter pilot when they team up at the end to take on the mother ship. Then there is Will Smith. The director must have just said to smith 'Just be yourself' meaning Fresh Prince of Bel air in a military uniform. Smith is much better in Men In Black (a real comedy) and the excellent i, robot so it is a shame he just made his character into a complete parody of the Hero.Special mention must go to Randy Quaid for playing one of the most annoying characters in movie history. Rand's character is to this film what Jar Jar Binks was to the later Star Wars prequel The Phantom Menace.The potential to make a great invasion thriller with measured humour and stunning thrills and chills is lost amid silly comic capers and daft one liners between insipid characters. ID4 made a lot of money but for me (and my friends) it was one of the biggest letdowns of 1996.",4,9,17,23 September 2006
2012," Its the end of the world...again.
","This wasn't too bad. I hated Independence Day and feared this would be worse, happily enough i left the cinema feeling moderately entertained. The special effects are the selling power of this film. Although Danny Glover was pretty good as the President. John Cusack was actually good as well. The tidal wave sequences are quite frightening (just like in the teaser trailer) and the earthquake sequences are fantastic. In terms of action its about survivors escaping disaster after disaster until suspension of disbelief is at breaking point. You'll like this film if you liked The Day After Tomorrow, but personally if given a choice id rather go and see Earthquake on the big screen.Cal",6,0,0,23 December 2009
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Another knife through the heart.
","An insane let down of a storyline with really bad performances from all the new characters, and the new film makers at Disney continue their mission to destroy everything that Star Wars means to the fans.The Force Awakens was a lazy rip off of the first film from 1977, only this time the political correctness and the Mary Sue rubbish are everywhere in that pile of garbage. The Last Jedi is more of the same and far worse too.Star Wars is dead in the water. The films will never regain their undisputed title of King Of The Hollywood Blockbusters, now they will forever brcome your run of the mill 'Meh' actioner bogged down by uninteresting characters and even more boring storylines. Folks, the magic has been destroyed forever.Saw Solo: A Star Wars Story and it was much better than The Last Jedi, but it had A V E R A G E stamped all over it, even the reliable Ron Howard as director couldn't make it a cut above the rest, Rogue One was marginally better but only just and some of it was very boring which should not be happening in these new films. The Disney gang have completely destroyed Star Wars.The Force is not with me. It left me on December 2015 and will probably never return. I was late, very late in typing this, due to the fact I have been totally aghast at how bad these films really are.R.I.P.

Inside Man," Best bank robbery film in years
","Dalton Russell (Clive Owen, Excellent)and his gang take over a New York bank and hold hostages, demanding the usual things from the Police presence gathered outside like food and drink and an air plane from the airport etc. etc.Enter Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington, superb) who is put in charge of the case and soon becomes suspicious of the gang's intentions....Jodie Foster plays Madeline White, a sort of freelance troubleshooting spin doctor lawyer who, hired by the bank's owner Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), is charged with obtaining a document within the vaults that cannot be seen by either Bank Robber or Policeman and would have serious consequences for Case if it were to fall into the wrong hands...This is Spike Lee's best film in a long time and certainly his best attempt so far at Hollywood mainstream thrillers, the whole film keeps you gripped from start to finish and has a surprise fantastic twist that will have you slapping your knee and going 'RIGHTTT!!!' Special mention must go to Clive Owen who stands out and steals the show from both Washington and Foster both Academy Award Winners, it can only be a matter of time before this fine actor gets a shoe in as well.9 out of ten.",9,1,2,7 October 2006
Pulp Fiction," Talk Fiction. Overrated and overpraised disappointment
","I will never understand why Pulp Fiction is hailed by so many as one of the greatest films ever made. Quentin Tarintino's first film Reservoir Dogs was amazing. It had excellent performances, some good action scenes, an impressive structure and fantastic sound track. When Pulp Fiction came out in my country in October 1994, i could not wait to see it. Empire Magazine gave it 5 stars. I remember when i went up to Glasgow to see it with an anticipation i had not felt since i had went to see some thing like Star Wars or Indiana Jones.Oh boy, twenty minutes in and i was already sick to death of Samuel Jackson's character. He just talked and talked and talked and....talked. John Travolta's Vince Vega was a guy i wanted to decimate, oh Travolta you looked ridiculous with those hair extensions and then you talked and talked and talked with Uma Thurman in a silly black wig. There was so much talking in this film that it made me want to walk out. I have only ever done this once in my life and it was with that utter garbage Jack Nicholson flick Wolf. Tosh.So i kept hoping that something good would happen...Christopher Walken as an army bloke talking and talking about a gold watch up his ass...NOT GOOD...a male rape scene with talk...NOT GOOD...Quentin Tarintino turning up in a cameo that should have got him shot (in real life) talk talk about disposing of bodies...oh, this film was the pits, i must have been the only one in the audience that hated this film, because everyone was whooping and hollering like they were watching a Naked Gun comedy. Oh yes, they loved it.Quiet frankly my admiration of Tarintino was gone forever, he got his head together with the brilliant Jackie Brown then lost the plot again with the silly Kill Bill volumes. Pulp Fiction is one of the worst movies I've ever had to endure, its a long boring ride to a sore head.",1,71,159,17 July 2008
The Da Vinci Code," Read the book again, because this is rubbish
","The Da Vinci Code was a straight adventure story with a dramatic revelation concerning historical events around The Holy Grail. Once you read the book by Dan Brown, you really did not need to see a film about the story, so when the book became a huge bestseller Hollywood produced one of the biggest wastes of money ever...yet it was a hit.The films crap. Tom Hanks is 100% miscast with one of the worst mullets in Cinema history.Audrey Tautou is frankly rubbish as Sophie and can't speak English very well.Jean Reno will always be Leon no matter how good he gets in films.The character of Silas is wrong. Paul Bettany is too young for the role and looks like a Sith Lord from the Star Wars films.And when the revelation comes it goes with a whimper and not a bang.One of the biggest letdowns of 2006.",1,1,5,4 December 2006
The Departed," You would not want to be a cop in Boston!
","This is a good movie from Martin Scorcese, about two Boston cops: Billy Costigan (Leonardo De Caprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who are involved with gangster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson).Billy Costigan is the 'good guy' cop who is sent undercover to bring Costello down, meanwhile Costello has an ace up his sleeve in Colin Sullivan, a man who has just left Police College and is rising high in the Boston Police Department within a short time. When Costello discovers he may have a 'rat' in the house he charges Sullivan with finding out the identity of the undercover cop thus placing Costigan in a very dangerous game of Cloak And Dagger.De Caprio is excellent in this film and Matt Damon shows us that as well as The Talented Mr Ripley, he can deliver a desperate bad guy when he tries. Jack Nicholson is his usual brilliant self, his Frank Costello reminded me of a cross between Jack Torrance and Darryl Van Horn. Kudos all around for the acting stakes.Special mention to Mark Wahlberg as a foul mouthed hard as nails detective, he really convinces as a hard bitten detective and he has good scenes with Alec Baldwin who is also very good in a small role.Oh and i lost count for the amount of people getting their heads blown off here, but take it from me if you enjoy fast paced violent thrillers you will lap this up.Seven Out Of Ten.",7,0,0,12 October 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Any potential for a classic sequel is destroyed forever
","I saw Transformers 2 Revenge Of The Fallen last night. I had been looking forward to seeing it for months. Well, this is a car crash of a movie sequel, i mean even though i enjoyed the first one very much, i was still disappointed how different Optimus Prime, Megatron, Jazz, Bumblebee and Starscream all looked in the final movie compared to their appearances in the Genration 1 comic books. But my disappointment got bigger and bigger until i left the cinema consumed with a hatred for the makers of this vile garbage that i could barely contain.To begin with, it starts with another gigantic, confusing battle in China (i think) there was so much happening in these scenes that it confounded my mind into a bloody headache. Optimus Prime and the autobots have teamed up with the platoon of soldiers from the first movie to go hunting down Decepticons around the Earth, so far so ho hum. The problem with this scene is that i couldn't tell who was autobot and who was decepticon because of the way the Transformers motion around on the big screen during the action scenes, this was a problem i had with the original as well.The narrative and the storyline were all over the place. I couldn't help thinking that the cast were hurrying through their scenes as if they were desperate to be somewhere else. Shia la Beouf is one of the worst actors ever to become a film star. Hes like a human version of Jar Jar Binks from Phantom Menace, honestly i wanted him to die horribly.Megan Fox kept me going though, but lets face it, she knows why shes in this film and its not because we all think she has the same range as Jodie Foster and Meryl Streep combined, its because shes fantastic looking straddled out over a Harley Davidson thats why. Thank God for that scene alone.The 'comedy' scenes stamped any potential this sequel had into the ground. What did the screenwriters think was so funny about Shia's mother running around his Campus high on Drugs? The dogs having sex on the couch didn't help either. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.I honestly thought this would be a great follow up to the first movie the way Superman 2 or even Terminator 2 was to their originals, but boy i was wrong...absolutely terrible.Cal.",1,26,57,13 July 2009
The Holiday," A sentimental sickening load of rubbish.
","I took a date to see this film and halfway through it she turned to me and said 'This is torture for you, is it not?' I replied 'Yes, especially Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet trying too hard to be funny and only making me more depressed.' There's a nauseating bit where Diaz's Amanda puts on The Killers' Hot Fuse album and dances her head off to the great band's Mr Brightside while slugging from a bottle of beer. Believe me, the cinema was full and no one was laughing.Oh Yes! The plot. Cameron Diaz (five miles OTT) is Amanda, an American cinema trailer editor with her own business. After dumping her man (Ed Burns) because he slept with his secretary she desires to get away from Los Angeles to a place where there are no males. After chatting on the computer with Iris (Kate Winslet) they agree to swap places for a few weeks or so. After arriving in England, Amanda finds herself falling in love with Iris's brother Graham (Jude Law) and Iris at Amanda's place, bonds with an old screenwriter veteran (the magnificent Eli Wallach) and slowly, SLOWLY falls for film composer and Amanda's work colleague Miles (Jack Black, on autopilot).This is one of those films that tries too hard to make you feel good and warm inside, like the Al Pacino film Frankie and Johnny. Anyone who is a bad egg gets their just deserts and anyone who is a good person triumphs in the end up. Not my cup of tea.However, Cameron Diaz is absolutely beautiful in every scene shes in. And the scene where Iris is telling Miles about her unrequited love for Jasper (Rufus Sewell) while he listens had me in tears of laughter when it reminded me of the scene in Airplane! when Ted Striker is boring the old woman passenger to death about his love for Elaine.If there are any witty scenes in this dross, its when Miles and Iris are in a DVD rental store and Dustin Hoffman has a five second cameo, when you see it you'll smirk. The rest is utter garbage.",1,23,46,12 December 2006
Jaws," The Greatest Film Ever Made.
","Jaws is the reason that i'm a Movie Fanatic today. One of the regrets of my life is that i have yet to see it in a cinema screen. Perhaps one day it will be released on its 50th anniversary on the big screen and a new generation will be haunted from going for a swim down by their local beach. I know that i will be first in the queue.Most users reading this review will be familiar with the plot. A gigantic Great White Shark starts feeding off the shores of Amity Island. A free spirited woman called Chrissie Watkins who takes a night swim is devoured in the film's unforgettable opening sequence. The Chief Of Police, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider in his most famous role) immediately closes the beaches in fear of another attack until he is persuaded by Mayor Larry Vaughan (Murray Hamilton) to keep them open because Amity needs 'Summer Dollars' to survive in the winter.When it becomes clear that the shark has no intention of going away and kills again, the authorities bring in Ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, brilliant) to determine exactly what kind of creature they are up against and how they can solve the problem. Despite efforts to convince the Mayor to keep the beaches closed, the Mayor refuses and horror strikes again during the 4th of July. Finally, and with no other alternative, Brody hires Shark Hunter Quint (Robert Shaw, in arguably his greatest role) and along with Hooper they set sail in Quint's vessel The Orca, to hunt the Shark which takes up the last fifty minutes of the film.The photography, lighting, set pieces (including the wonderful Orca itself) are absolutely brilliant. This is a film that ages like a fine wine. Some detractors and critics of this film might deride the Shark for its unconvincing close ups towards the end of the film, but its as good as any Computer Generated Imagery simply because it is really THERE.John Williams memorable score is one of the most popular in film history. The music is terrifying when the shark is around, and it is thrilling when the crew of The Orca chase the shark across the Atlantic whilst firing those yellow barrels time and again. William's Score was fifty percent responsible for the success of this Picture. He also won the Oscar for it. Enough said.This is Steven Spielberg's Best Film. It is also The Greatest Film Ever Made. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and especially Robert Shaw should have been awarded special Oscars for such brilliant character performances. There have been rumours that they are planning a remake or a re imagining of Jaws, but if this happens, then Hollywood will have swallowed itself like a Boa Constrictor, for this was the first film that defined the term 'Summer Blockbuster' and created an era of big Hollywood movies that were King of the Box Office...a remake might destroy that forever.My Favourite Film Ever. I Love Jaws.Cal.",10,3,7,18 March 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best 'prequel' without a doubt
","There's much more villainy and action in Revenge Of The Sith than what has gone before, but still there are boring parts where you are strumming your fingers, and the 'love' dialogue between Anakin and Padme is a random irritation throughout.Special mention to Iain Mcdarmid as chancellor Palpatine and Darth Sidious. His careful skill of drawing an insecure Anakin deeper into his web of deceit and evil is masterful, and the scene where Palpatine battles with Mace Windu is one of the best moments in the film, as is his eventual appearance near the climax as the grim reaper figure we all knew from Return Of The Jedi.The opening sequence in Revenge Of The Sith is a joy to behold, the space battle has so much detail going on around the main characters, that you see something new that you missed before.The rematch battle between Skywalker/Kenobi/Dooku is another superb highlight, there is more use of Christopher Lee's stuntman in these scenes but the digital 'head' effects are so better than they were in Attack Of The Clones that you really believe that Lee is really doing all his own stunt work. masterful. And the scene where Anakin kills Dooku is a star wars 'shock' moment on a par with Luke getting his hand chopped off in The Empire Strikes Back. Excellent.",8,0,1,29 July 2006
Platoon," The Best Vietnam War Film Ever Made
","This film is Oliver Stone's greatest film. Platoon is a film made by a man who was there, and saw the Vietnam War from the 'Grunt's' perspective.Charlie Sheen is particularly good as Chris Taylor, the young naive teenager who will receive his baptism of fire in the jungles of Nam through the leadership of Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe, Excellent) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger mesmerising as the bad guy).Platoon is a film that does what it sets out to do: Portray the Vietnam War for what it is: The loss of 58,000 American lives at the expense of Government propaganda on Communism.If the ending of this film does not get to you, you've probably got a heart of stone. The film is up there with The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now as one of the best films about the Vietnam War ever made.",10,1,2,16 December 2004
Halloween," The Original and Best.........alongside Halloween II
","You can tell a very good horror film by the amount of imitators it has had and Halloween has had its fair share.But what makes Halloween a classic scare story is the unique and chilling bogeyman character that is Michael Myers, stalking young female babysitters in the town of Haddonfield.He is quite simply a murderous killing machine dressed in mechanical overalls with that scary 'captain kirk' white mask exclaiming nothing but motiveless murder.... It is here that John Carpenter successfully confounds us with the truth that this monster is a twenty one year old kid who brutally murdered his older sister when he was six and has returned to Haddonfield fifteen years later to relive that past crime over and over by stalking Jamie Lee Curtis and her sex mad friends and offing just about anyone, (or any animal, it must be said) that gets in his way.Excellent performances from Curtis, Donald Pleasence, and the supporting players, plus a special mention for the actor/director Nick Castle who brought to life probably the most frightening bogeyman of them all.On its own, Halloween plays as a one off, but its first sequel, Halloween II, is excellent and essential viewing as a worthy concluding companion. Forget the other sequels. Ten Out Of Ten.",9,1,2,18 March 2004
Raging Bull," The perfect film about a man's self destruction.
","This is one of the most beguiling and emotionally upsetting films about a violent man's self destruction i have ever seen.Martin Scorcese's masterpiece is like a violent 'Life' magazine turned three dimensional.The fights that Jake La Motta has in the Boxing Ring with Sugar Ray Robinson are filmed like brutal stormy images in Hell.Robert De Niro would not turn in a performance like this until 1991's Cape Fear. His Jake La Motta is mesmerising from start to finish. Now and again i think about that terrible sequence where La Motta is facing his shadow against a Jail Cell Wall, then starts beating his fists in a rage and screaming 'why' at himself. Lots of people always remember that scene.Plus the moment where La Motta lets himself be beaten to a pulp by Sugar Ray Robinson is the turning point in the whole film. The character's downfall is horrible to watch both mentally and physically but that is the essence and power of this savage and brutal story.Special mention must go to Joe Pesci as La Motta's brother Joey, who does well as the alienated sibling who ends up abandoning Jake because of his terrible assault on him for suspecting an affair with Jake's wife Vicki.See this film. It is a Masterpiece.Ten Out Of Ten",10,2,4,28 October 2006
Casino Royale," James Bond has returned.....Utterly miscast in a disappointing film!
","Casino Royale is a very good action spy thriller that anyone who is not a real James Bond Fan will enjoy immensely.However i'm a James Bond Fan and i'm afraid that Casino Royale is a disappointment. It left me feeling the exact same way as i did when i saw On Her Majesty's Secret Service for the first time, and not just because its a miscast actor in the role.I mean Daniel Craig is simply WRONG for the role of James Bond! There's a scene where he tries on the Tuxedo in a hotel room for the first time and poses in the bathroom mirror to let the audience speculate. Sorry, but he reminded me more of Robert Shaw's Red Grant in From Russia With Love rather than Sean Connery or Roger Moore...and i'm sick of hearing that most of Moore's Bond films were rubbish, they were brilliant flicks! Anyway, Daniel Craig seems to have been told by the director Martin Campbell to REALLY pout those lips at the camera and the Production lighting enhances those sea blue eyes of his as to make him as sub human as possible. All wrong i'm afraid. Daniel Craig is a superb character actor in films like Layer Cake and TV shows like Our Friends In The North, but as James Bond 007 he is severely miscast on looks alone. As I've said he would have made a great Bond villain or henchman but not as the suave and sophisticated great Spy himself.Its not all Daniel Craig's fault of course. The music score is rubbish as is the title song 'You know my Name'. David Arnold is a lacklustre composer who recycles classic Bond themes and tracks through crappy computer and keyboard equipment, John Barry he is not! The way the Bond producers try to screw around with the 'tradition' of James Bond films defies belief. By tradition i mean the classic mini adventure has been tampered with to have James Bond's gun barrel sequence take place in.....a slum toilet. And Bond's second kill in this film is a tired retread of James Bond's assassination of Professor Dent in Dr. No. The storyline is asking us to forsake all that has gone before from Dr. No to Die Another Day and that Bond has just obtained his 'OO' license to kill and that the real Bond adventures start here.If that is to be the case then what the hell is Judi Dench doing as M?! Her character has been badly rewritten, she does not really like this Bond but during the Brosnan days she secretly liked and yearned for Bond to come back safely. Its all really depressing that the producers and writers were anxious to change the formula again, and what if Daniel Craig quits after his second outing like Dalton did? Then they are in trouble , because if Bond ends up being portrayed by as many actors who played Tarzan then the character of Bond will become lost for good and no one will identify with who and what he was all about in the first place.A bitterly disappointing Bond film.",5,1,3,8 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Knife In The Heart.
","Forgive my pretentious summary but thats how I felt after seeing The Force Awakens on Friday the 18th of December 2015 at the IMAX theatre next to the science centre in Glasgow.Why do I mention the location? Simply because this was where I slowly felt the beginning of the end of my enthusiasm for future Star Wars films. I love the original trilogy and I like the prequels to an extent, the problem with The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith is that the dialogue was quite bad, the acting was wooden and there was a superabundance of Computer Generated Imagery. Also, as with Episode I, George Lucas clearly thought that Jar Jar Binks was the most interesting and important character in that movie instead of someone with a fantastic presence like Darth Maul. Likable and audience appealing characters are strangely underwritten and hardly feature in the Star Wars Universe. Weird. But I STILL like the prequels, remember folks, to keep grounded, George Lucas was making this up as he went along. Its the only way to accept all the plot holes poorly linking Prequel to Original. Entertaining nevertheless.Anyway, The Force Awakens is directed by JJ Abrams, a man who is a competent enough action and TV director, but mostly makes films that are copies of better works from more extremely talented film makers. Nicholas Myer who directed the classics Wrath Of Khan and The Undiscovered Country is a far better director than Abrams. Why didn't they ask him to direct The Force Awakens? I bet he would have made a more interesting and engaging film.The plot is the same as A New Hope except for different names. Poe Dameron is Han Solo. 'Rey' is Luke Skywalker. Finn is Threepio/Luke/Han/Lando. Kylo Ren is Darth Vader. BB8 is R2 D2.The Story: A young woman teams up with an on the run rogue who protect a droid carrying vital information to help in their defence against the evil galactic FIRST ORDER.Han Solo and Chewbacca make a solid entrance later on in the film. Then Han Solo is murdered by his son who it is revealed is none other than Kylo Ren who was once 'Ben Solo' Its actually a good scene ruined when Solo is thrown off the bridge and discarded as if he were a ten minute extra or star trek red shirt. That was a knife in the heart, one of the greatest and most beloved science fiction characters of all time and he is killed off as if he were nothing.Update. As over two years have passed, I watched this on Netflix and it is an absolute failure in terms of new characters and storyline. A bad rip off of everything that has went before.Carrie Fisher as General Leia was a little disappointing, shes just portrayed as an ageing rebel fighter in command of a section of the 'Resistance' that looks exactly like the Rebel Base Headquarters on the planet Yavin, with the same computer looking billboards etc etc.God, I'm getting bored typing this up, what should have been a Triumph for all of us Star Wars Fans is at worst badly written character development at best an 'ok' remake of A New Hope, which for many on here is unacceptable.The ending is a brutal, spirit crushing disappointment. Rey, having acquired Jedi Knight usage in the space of an hour and a half confronts an Obi Wanish Luke Skywalker on what looks like Middle Earth (A Lord Of The Rings Crossover??? Nooooooooooooooo!!!!!) He in turn, stands looking at her, she takes out his lightsaber from her satchel and holds it out to him, he looks at it, does absolutely nothing and they stare at each other before a Helicopter POV shot spins wildly round the two figures before breaking into Star Wars end credits and the show is over.I cant even be bothered to type about the mega Death Star which is a planet with a laser in it and is SO original. After it was destroyed I found myself yawning just wanting it to end. The film is a major disappointment, I don't care if it earns 5 Billion, that is the result of blinkered fan-boys refusing to admit that they've been had by a Coporation that wants a return on their 4 Billion investment and doesn't really give a HOOT what the public want in a story and Adventure.Ill be waiting for the next two films to come out in cinemas and my plan is this: If they are worse instead of better than The Force Awakens then the only films ill be buying in the future regarding Star Wars will be the Original Trilogy Theatrical Versions on Blu Ray. I can't see the spin off movies being brilliant, the film here isn't really that great, its merely passable because people are blinkered to the Truth which is this: THE FORCE AWAKENS IS A REMAKE OF A NEW HOPE. THE CHARACTERS ARE MORE OR LESS STEREOTYPES ON WHAT WAS BEFORE. AND THERE WAS NOTHING DISTINCTIVE FROM JOHN WILLIAMS THIS TIME.This gets five out of ten simply because I refuse to hate on a franchise that is the benchmark for all modern adventure fantasy cinema.A very disappointing start to the new trilogy.....heres hoping it gets better.",1,35,41,4 January 2016
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The classic original is the best in the series.
","I love A Nightmare On Elm Street. Every time i watch this i think it has a terrific energy and strength running through it. I like the way the film starts with Freddy Kruegar making his Finger Knife Glove in his basement cellar, then the music kicks in (what a creepy score) as the first teenager is frantically running around his maze-like Boiler Room in her dream state. Freddy is only hinted at in the shadows or ripping through cloth with his glove and i love the way you can hear animals and creepy noises emitting from all around Tina, as she becomes cornered before Freddy comes out of the shadows. A great opening.Tina Grey is played by Amanda Wyss, who is really good in her role for the short time she is in this film. I always remember her character in this film the way i remember the Chrissie Watkins character at the start of Jaws, i think you know what i'm coming too. Tina's encounter with Freddy in her backyard is my favourite moment in this film, and it is one of the most horrifying deaths I've ever seen. Its frightening to see and if you are faint hearted at splashing blood then look away because it is a screamer.Heather Langenkamp is excellent in this film. Shes very attractive,and gives 100% as Tina's friend Nancy Thompson who starts to have the same nightmares. My favourite moments with Nancy are mostly her scary encounters with Freddy scored to an energetic music beat by Charles Bernstein. I would say part of the movie's success is down to his creepy score. I also love the bathroom scene when Nancy falls asleep, absolutely gross and hilarious at the same time. The thing is, these 'funny' moments are actual imagines of how Freddy wants to prey on his victims before killing them, this is done in this first film with a measured discipline, then you watch The Dream Master and Freddy is basically killing kids while being 100% comic about it as well.One of my favourite other scenes in this film is when Nancy is following Tina's corpse down her School halls (having falling asleep)and runs into a prefect women who states 'Wheres your pass?' Nancy doesn't respond in kind, and as she goes running down the hall, the girl reveals herself to be Freddy 'No running in the hallway' an eerie moment that is funny too.Finally, special mention must go to Robert Englund as Freddy Kruegar. This actor's contribution to the character is 100% superb. I think that Freddy Kruegar IS Robert Englund and vice versa, even though a lot of his moments in this film are about injecting a scary visual presence, he also creates a mystic before the film's revelation: Who is he? Where does he come from? Why is he doing these things? After the third film of the series, Englund would become a Hollywood star and a horror icon. Rightfully so.A Nightmare On Elm Street is a classic horror thriller and, along with Halloween, is one of the best horror movies ever made.",10,16,18,26 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Greatest Sci fi adventure ever.
","Star Wars was the film that changed cinema forever. It had everything, brilliant special effects, a scary villain, fully built set pieces that you had never seen before, a brilliant music score from John Williams and likable characters in Han Solo and Obi-wan Kenobi well played by Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness. It was a film that had blazing action from start to finish, it was a film that the writer and director George Lucas had intended for children, his target audience was twelve and under, but it became a true mega blockbuster and people of all ages came again and again, dragging their friends with them.My favourite scenes include the opening sequence: the massive imperial Star Destroyer roaring over the screen attacking the fleeing rebel cruiser, that scene is mind-blowing on a cinema screen, i love the introduction of Darth Vader emerging from the smoke of the laser battle between the Stormtroopers and the Rebels, i also like the way Vader is established as an evil killer right away when he crushes the neck of some poor hapless rebel prisoner holding him up with one hand and throwing him to the side like a rag doll, this gives Vader's character a sense of malevolence from the kickoff.I also like the lightsaber duel between obi-wan and Vader on the Death Star more so for the verbal exchanges between the two Jedi 'When i was with you i was but the learner now i am the master.' Obi-wan:'Only a master of evil DARTH!!!' The duel is not as energetic as Luke and Vader in The Empire Strikes Back, but it is still a powerful and moving moment especially when Luke, Han and Leia make a dash for the falcon and Luke sees Obi-wan cornered by Vader. That scene is one of emotion that Lucas hits right on the head, Luke sees Obi-wan's plight, Obi-wan smiles at Vader, he raises his sabre and closes his eyes, Vader strikes as look screams 'NO!' and John Williams score swells with tragic loss as Luke blasts away at the Stormtroopers. Its the one scene that sticks in my mind about A New Hope, that isn't special effects or cgi.The final aerial assault between TIE fighters and X-wing fighters over the Death Star is perhaps the most exciting finale of any movie, the tunnel chase with Luke's X-wing and Vader's TIE fighter thrills ALL the time. Finally i have to say when i talk to people who have seen Star wars in any shape or form, rarely do they say they don't like the movies, but when i do meet someone that hates these classics they ALWAYS say the same thing: 'Im not really interested in films.' That says it all, does it not?",10,4,7,4 October 2004
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best Star Wars film ever made.
","The first sequel is the darkest and the best ever made. (I know that episode III is still to come out but i dunno...) My own theory for the success of The Empire Strikes Back is that at the time of it's release audiences believed it would be more of the same as the first film but bigger and better, what they got also was a great storyline, developing characters both good and bad, blazing action sequences and John Williams Empire/Darth Vader score that was to return in the next movie.My personal favourite character in this episode has to be Darth Vader. Alfred Hitchcock once said if you make a thriller or suspense drama and there are bad guys in your story they HAVE to be interesting and dangerous, in Vader's case his introduction on his star destroyer when we first see him standing with his back to us gazing out at the empire's fleet of cruisers, you hear his heavy breathing, the film is saying to us 'No introduction necessary!' After that he starts murdering commanders who fail to catch the rebels in the Millennium Falcon with a wit that is darker than his cape, i also loved the part where he has an audience with the emperor, that scene is dripping with evil, Vader perched on a podium while a huge hologram of the emperor beams over him and they plot to lure Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side, this scene also suggests that Vader has purpose for wanting Skywalker to live, as we later find out.The memorable duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker is one of the most defining moments of the trilogy. I remember seeing this film on it's special Edition re-release in the Glasgow Odeon in 1997, when Vader states 'The force is with you young Skywalker...but you are not a Jedi yet.' Luke climbs those stairs to face his nemesis, the audience just shut up.What I'm saying is THIS moment is the fight the fans were all waiting for and the outcome was so surprising and cliffhanging that people could not believe that a space fantasy film had come to such a conclusion of uncertainty for the heroic rebels.The Empire Strikes Back is not only the best star wars film but quite possibly one of the greatest films ever made in over a hundred years of cinema history.",10,0,1,10 August 2004
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Last Crusade is another blockbuster masterpiece...JUST.
","By the third film, you can see that Temple Of Doom was a departure and that this plot was the same structure as Raiders which is no bad thing at all when you consider that the casting of Sean Connery as Doctor Jone's father was a stroke of genius. It also gave the screen writers more material to elaborate on the characters of both Indy and Henry as they fight the Nazis in a race for the Holy Grail.There are welcome returns for Sallah and Marcus Brody, as well as new characters like Walter Donovan and Indy's love/hate interest Dr. Elisa Schneider. The action sequences at the start of this film are a bit flat on the circus train and are trying too hard to be light hearted, but the Venice speed boat chase and the fight between Indy and the SS Nazi on the huge battle tank more than compensates. Sean Connery is excellent as Dr. Henry Jones, playing him with the correct wit and sense of humour and interacts marvellously with Harrison Ford. The sun sets on a fabulous third adventure, sadly George Lucas just could not leave things be.",10,0,1,17 June 2008
The Godfather," The Mafia Masterpiece you cannot refuse!
","The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made. A complex and detailed gangster epic from 1946 to the late fifties on the Corleone family 'business'.It stars Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, the most powerful lord of the Cosa Nostra, approaching the twilight of his life, the Don and his family come under attack from a Turkish gangster called Sollozzo who is angry at the Don's refusal to give him legal protection for his new drugs business, and so a war begins between the five families of New York city over a period of five years. Slowly the Mafia Don's reluctant son Michael (who is a decorated soldier) takes over and later self-discovers that he was always destined to be a man like his father.This is really what the heart of the story is all about, a man who wanted to be honest and good in life but because of terrible circumstances takes over an Empire and becomes a figure he always denied.The cast and supporting players are all excellent but the standout is Al Pacino.Ten Out Of Ten.",10,1,3,19 March 2004
