It," Its not a horror film.
","OK just lets get one thing out of the way. I have not seen the original TV series or any other production of this story. I also have not read the book so this is not one of those 'its not as good as the book or original moans'. Having just watched the movie I can say its definitely worth watching. Its a well enough made film with some great effects and acting. However I did find some of the kids dialogue inaudible and it seemed to be difficult to pick out what they were saying sometimes with too many voices at once. Another issue with the sound was the odd choice of music which did not seem to sit right with the actual scenes. There were a few comedic parts which did not really seem to hit the mark either. However what I will say is that the film just is not scary. There's no tension before any of the supposed frights, they are set up in a way that you see them coming a mile off and when they do you basically find yourself thinking, OK so the clowns here and its doing its cgi thing but no that was not a surprise and I did not get a fright. In the screening I was I did not see a single person react to any of the scares. That is the main problem with this movie. The posters and trailers sell the film as a scary horror, which it is not. Its like a mix of The Lost Boys and Stand By Me. I could see this movie having a PG rating if one or two scenes were removed, but these scenes do not involve the clown. If you are expecting a real horror film or something closer to the book you may be disappointed. But go in with an open mind and you will probably enjoy it. Its an adventure movie not a horror.",6,16,30,11 September 2017
Captain Marvel," An average Marvel movie nothing more or less.
","Having noticed the hyperbole surrounding this movie I decided to go see it for myself. There seems to be polar opinions of hate and love which is basically both sides of the same coin. People who havent seen the movie who are pushing an agenda.
Since I dont care for either side of this debate I wanted to make up my own mind.
In truth this is an average Marvel movie, something like one of the Antman movies in terms of scale and impact. Its a simple origins story so its not fair to compare it something of the size of a Guardians or Avengers.
The effects and cinematography are fine, however the acting, script, humour and action sequences are very average, it is not an emotional roller coaster by any means. This movie does not trigger any strong emotional responses, but this is a superhero movie anyway.
There are on the surface some politics woven into the story, its about refugees. Also this is some female empowerment stuff however that is obviously not aimed at people like me. I just chose to ignore it and it didnt really spoil anything for me. In truth this is more of a Marvel movie aimed at a young female audience. Its simply not for men. Similar to how Black Panther was aimed at a black audience, this will be well received by its target demographic.
Not every Marvel movie is for the same audience. Deal with it.",5,7,13,11 March 2019
Us," Obvio-us? Good, but not as good as Get Out.
","Expectations for this movie were very high, based on the previous movie by the same director.
I managed to watch this on its first screening at the local cinema, along with one other person in a not very busy screening.
I am a fan of the writer/directors debut Get Out which was an original horror with quite a bit of social commentary. However Us neither feels as original or has the same level of explicit social commentary Get Out has.
Maybe it does have a social commentary message and I just didn't get it?
This movie feels like a guest directed movie version of a Twilight Zone episode, which is pretty much what it is.
The story revolves around a family returning to their beach holiday home and having to deal with the unwelcome and dangerous visitors who come in the middle of the night. Watching trailers gave the impression that this was a house siege type of movie which it isn't. The action moves away from the family house and elsewhere so if you were expecting a drawn out tense home invasion movie that's not on offer.
This is more of a psychological horror with some violence and blood, not flat out impossible levels of gore.
The film does build up tension and doesn't rely on jump scares, there is also some humour which does work, although the other patron I saw this with didn't seem to think so. Well not everybody likes rap music or maybe he was the police?
The score and soundtrack are both very well done, adding to the comic relief at some points.
The biggest problem I have with the movie is that the ending was predictable, maybe this is due to the source material being part of the Twilight Zone cannon. What may have been difficult to second guess back in the day is quite easy to predict today. It takes more to fool people these days.
Where this is original or at least unfortunately rare is that we have a horror movie, well basically a movie about a middle class black family which is to be celebrated. We are moving away from the hood movie equals black movie era which can only be a good thing. Even black horror movies in the past always seemed to located in a ghetto environment. Not this time.
Its a very good horror movie its just unfortunate that Get Out is an excellent horror movie which its bound to be compared to.
One thing about the movie is that you simply cannot understand everything about it in one showing. Anyone who thinks they can is deluded and simply trying to appear smarter than they are. It has been designed to be watched multiple times which begins to feel like a cheap trick to manipulate the box office. Based on this reason I have downgraded my rating to a five, if you cant experience the full story watching something once, its a fail.",5,3,4,22 March 2019
Aquaman," Now that was just silly.
","Aquaman is just the next comic book hero movie to come along that nobody in particular asked for. Part of the underwhelming DC universe its a surprise that this movie was released based on the bad reviews of so many of the DC universe cannon. It was a strange decision to release the Justice League movie which was an ensemble cast before each of the individual characters had their own movies released.
Back to Aquaman. The basic story is that Aquamans mother (Nicole Kidman) is cast out of her underwater kingdom and is taken in by a lighthouse keeper, played by Temuera Morrison. Fast forward and Aquaman is born and his mother is dragged away by some angry Aquaworld police in space uniforms. This sets the tone for the movie as it seems that any time we have any relative quiet, something explodes. This a repeated theme throughout which begins to seem laughable on repetition. Another odd motif is the use of shouting. Not people shouting in arguments using actual words, just AAAAAAAAAARRRGGGGHHH for no real reason. Trust me this happens. Although this is supposed to be an underwater story it really looks like a sci-fi set in space with lazers, space ships and space suits. At one point it actually looks like Tron Legacy and even sounds like the Tron Legacy soundtrack, this cant have been a mistake?
As for the actual storyline its quite hard to keep up as it seems to bounce around quite a bit, there is a subplot about an evil pirate who is out for revenge against Aquaman called Manta, but he should really be called Frog Helmet due to his ridiculous costume. Watching the movie you basically forget he exists until BOOOM, another explosion and there he is. I warned you about the Booms.
Despite a few well known faces the acting is quite poor, Aquamans is case in point, he seems to chew his words and it looks like the only reason he got the role was his looks. His jokes and pretty much all of the jokes in the movie fall flat.
Some of the visuals are impressive but its a 95% CGI movie and despite the sheer amount of onscreen action its neither engaging or exciting. Its a very Zach Snyder type of movie, at times dark visuals with slow mo but a very hollow experience.
You could easily stick this on to watch while you tidy your house but I doubt that it would be enough to draw you in to make you give up the housework.
It can be interesting visually at times but with a messy script, zero emotional content, sub par acting and very little to remember after. Still, you will have managed to complete over two hours worth of housework with some flashing lights and loud noises for company.",5,0,0,6 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Far too much in two hours!
","I have just been to a midnight showing of this in the UK. I attended the other two recent movies in the same cinema also at midnight screenings and for some reason this one just didn't have the same excitement around it. The cinema was half empty which is very unusual for midnight screenings of Blockbusters.
Even trying to avoid spoilers many of them have been leaked in the press so unless you have avoided all media you are sure to have any surprises ruined.
As for the movie? It really just plays like an action movie. Which is no what these are supposed to be about. There is zero emotional content. This is supposed to be the resolution of a 40 year franchise and it just seems clang to a halt. It's not that the story doesn't resolve, its just that on an emotional level, it doesn't.
This is partly to do with the sheer pace which things happen. Everything is so crammed in there's no space to breathe. This is a three hour plus movie crammed into just over two. You simply don't get the time to emotionally engage with the plot or characters which leaves it a bit of an empty experience. Also the story is far too similar to Jedi, it's just been done with 2019 special effects. The fact it's nothing new story wise also makes this feel like a wasted opportunity. It's one thing reference previous movies but 90% of this movie is from the first three. I think this episode will lead to a game of thrones response, I can see a petition to have this remade. Sorry to disappoint but for all the action it simply lacks emotional engagement and storyline.",5,8,16,19 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Deceptively Average.
","There are far too many Queen fans who have over-rated this movie but its easy to see why.
This is a very basic/average movie which is lifted by the musical scenes.
Despite the content and story, this is a very bland and strangely unemotional paint by the numbers story of a rock band, the way they would like you to think of them.
There is barely a mis-step on the bands journey from small venues to first album and then sell out shows. Surely it wasnt that easy? Because its certainly not believable.
The movie is structured in way it shows you a bland story section then a live music number and repeat till the end.
The live musical scenes are done well however this detracts from the actual story telling and emotional content which falls quite flat. Also too much story time is wasted on how certain songs were written. It seems like each band member wanted to show that they wrote a song in the Queen canon as if this actually mattered for the story. So much seems to have been missed story-wise in the 2 hour running time and this is where a huge chuck of the movie is wasted.
The reason I say the very high ratings are deceptive is because the only moment which packs any punch is the last act which is very well done.
The problem is that it leave you wondering why this was the only section of the movie which engaging and worth the fee. Its also why we have so many reviews which are so high is because this is the last part you experience.
For me the 8 and even 10 ratings are reserved for movies which have better content than a decent last twenty minutes.
The critics were correct, this is a flawed movie, its just that it ends on a high and some people cant see past this cheap trick.",5,3,10,21 November 2018
Grease," Late to the party.
","I had managed to avoid watching Grease for 44 years. The reason being that Grease is primarily a movie for girls. The reason I say that is that even as a child I can vividly remember girls reactions to the movie which was basically the same as they would to a boy band. This response is guaranteed to repel any male.
Not to mention its basically a love story from the female perspective and the males are basically goofballs along for the ride. All of the main characters are female, dont believe me? How many males versus females get their own song?
There are some very odd complaints about this movie which are common. First is they thinks its anti-women. Which is impossible being a female focused cast. The other so called 'anti-feminist' belief about the movie is that they think the message to girls is they have to change for a man. This is bizarre. We know that both the lead male and female make superficial attempts to change for each other. So to argue that its only the female who makes an effort to change is easily proven wrong. Not only that but if anyone genuinely believes that changing your clothes and hairstyle (which they both did) means a change in personality then psychological science has it all wrong. Everyone has to make allowances for their partners but in this case it was basically two people who made small changes in order to be closer and in effect try and take on some of the others' personality or likes, to be together. The thing is it was obvious that this wasn't actually required of either of them.
What made me actually watch this was the current trend of live orchestral music during a movie. This is not a cheap option as its basically attending theatre (with theatre prices) while a movie plays. This is expensive event cinema. Luckily for me I obtained a complimentary ticket and attended, so this review is from someone who caught this as a movie with live orchestra which greatly enhanced the event. Basically without this I was unlikely to watch this on a big screen.Other odd complaints are that it feels dated (it was set in the 50s) or its not serious enough. If you want serious there is always Rumble Fish. This a musical comedy and supposed to be fun. Which it is. The enthusiasm of the cast and their joy on screen is what elevates this movie. Basically the grumps who dislike this are basically saying they don't enjoy watching people have a good time. Yes these people exist.
The music is iconic and the performances perfect, yes we all know that they arent kids in this movie but hey, if it was it wouldn't be as good.
There isn't much else to say about this apart from if you havent seen it you should as its part of the best American movies ever made. If your a guy, try your best to avoid watching it with large numbers of females (because they will get overly excited and sing along). And if you do get the chance watch it with the live orchestra, it brings a whole new level of enjoyment.",8,0,0,6 February 2020
The Exorcist," It gets better as you age.
","Everyone has watched the exorcist at some point and its so well know that franchises like Scary Movie have ripped it off so well that its difficult not to raise a smile when scenes which were lampooned show up in the first few mins of the exorcist. Or so I thought.
It doesnt take long for the creeping dread of this movie to make you forget Scary Movie ever existed.
Theres no real need to explain the plot as its so well know.
Having watched this when I was much younger what I recalled were the possession scenes and the exorcism itself, however that isnt where the magic lies.
What stands out re-watching this as an adult was the sinister and creepy build up towards the exorcism.
What seems to be forgotten is that in this movie the possession is never really confirmed until the final third of the movie, a host of psychiatrist use the crude science available at the time in order to try and explain away the behaviour of the possessed girl. Watching the mother try to come to terms with whats happening and the ordeal the girl experiences at the hands of the medics is also harrowing.
The reason this is regarded as one of the best movies ever made are the human relationships and trials as an adult which are tested by the devil. Its aim is to drive a wedge between families and exploit the guilt families may feel towards each other. It is also authentic and was aided in production by the church who ensured it treated the matter seriously.
Sure some of the effects may look dated but its still effective. Or it was when I watched it this halloween in a freezing, dusty and decaying cinema. The environment certainly added to atmosphere of the movie.
I have heard reviews that some younger audiences have found this funny and cannot take it seriously, I doubt that will be the case when they grow up and watch this with the eyes of an adult. Its much more than one of the best horrors, its one of the best movies ever made. Period.",8,4,5,3 November 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Great ending to the franchise.
","I managed to attend a double bill of this and Infinity War last night with Endgame being the midnight movie.
Going to a midnight showing takes alot of effort as you are disrupting your working week to watch a movie until 3 am, but it seems to be the only way to avoid having the movie spoiled.
Was it worth the upheaval? In short yes. This definitely delivers as the franchise closer. This is a very dark movie at the beginning and while their is alot going on story wise (there are alot of character story arcs to deal with) it feels like a resolution to the overall narrative.
This could be problematic for some people who haven't seen every movie in the franchise as stories are resolved from characters origins movies.
As is the standard with this franchise the action scenes and effects are so well done that watching other superhero movies can pale in comparison. The blending of the different character universes is seamless and the fun is watching the interactions of the characters.
All action, twists, humour and emotion which you have come to expect in these movies is here.
If you have managed to resist looking for spoilers online then see it as soon as possible, because people will want to discuss this movie. If you are the type of actively went looking for them then you may have ruined the movie for yourself as one of the numerous rumoured plot lines is real. You only have yourself to blame.
Endgame doesn't have the same heavyweight emotional punch that Infinity War does but they were never going to top THAT ending. Although there were men crying in the screening I attended and tried to pretend they weren't.
This appears to be a definite ending to this particular story arc as there is NO post credit scene, so you are know equipped with the knowledge to beat the crowds at the end.
No spoilers and a handy tip? You don't get that from every IMDB reviewer!",9,0,4,25 April 2019
Climax," More French Arty Garbage.
","This is an extraordinarily bad movie experience.
This is from same director who made Irreversible, the movie which prompted mass walk outs and for good reason. He seems to enjoy disgusting people with violence most would not class as entertainment. We yet again are subjected to extended discussions about anal sex which seems to be a theme in this directors work, to what purpose? It seems its all about intentionally trying to provoke disgust 'in the name of art'. In Climax we see pregnant women being kicked in the stomach, small children drugged and electrocuted and incest between siblings.
That is the tone of the movie and it beggars belief that this has any high ratings on here at all, or it says alot about the moral compass of those who enjoyed this trash. Its basically aimed at a pretentious audience who believe they have superior taste to others because they think 'enjoy' things the majority rightly ignore or that because the movie is in French its somehow above critique. If this had come from Hollywood or if more people knew about its content it would have been slated.
The film itself doesn't amount to much. Its based around a group of dancers, we initially see them being interviewed then it moves to the dancefloor. An extended stylised dance sequence takes place before a party where most the dancers drink a sangria spiked with LSD. The remainder of the film is basically each dancer having a bad LSD trip and the final act is just plain nonsense with everyone writhing around on the floor while a red strobe flashes and camera is shot upside down. Oooh arty.
The odd thing is that none of the dancers seem to have any clue as to how LSD affects individuals, they all have the same reaction which is negative. This rings hollow. Anyone who has attended a rave or music festival where hundreds if not thousands of people may be on drugs do not all decide to try and kill each other. Its not a realistic premise. Nor is the premise that despite bad things happening they would all decide to hang around in the same room. Its difficult to make a movie about being trapped with others when the doors are all unlocked. Fail.
There really isn't anything about this which is positive, its odd that quite a few well know electronic musicians agreed to have their music attached to such a bad movie. That being said the musical choices of each artists don't exactly fit well with the scenes they are used in. Although the soundtrack is probably what attracts some of the audience.
Oh yeah the closing credits of the movie are at the start and some of them are written upside down or backwards. If you think thats 'edgy' then you may like but if you just find it tedious trying to read upside down or backwards then head for the exit because it just gets worse,way worse after the credits roll.",1,10,22,7 March 2019
The Favourite," Entertaining, if crude, period drama with a very weak ending.
","Fans of period dramas will be split on this movie. For many period dramas are a genteel affair which provide an escape from many of the trappings of modern movies such a explicit sex, violence and swearing. This point was brought home when I attended a screening of the favourite and noticed just how many of the audience were elderly women, keen on seeing what all the fuss was about with The Favourite.
It was clear that many were shocked by this movie as it is fairly sexually explicit and the use of course language is rife throughout. This is no BBC production.
The story itself concerns a power struggle between two cousins who try and outdo each other using any many underhand means as possible to gain favour with the Queen and become her favourite.
This is a very engaging movie for the most part however the ending just seems to happen without any real conclusions, its as if the final reel has gone missing and it is a major disappointment. More so because the story seemed to be coming to a head and then........... just nothing.
The cinematography however is stunning and so many scenes look like a painting come to life.
This is a modern slant on a period drama with explicit sex scenes, very vulgar language and cruel humour so be warned, if that is not your thing then The Favourite is not for you.
If however you enjoy great visuals and dialogue similar to that spouted on The Thick of It by Malcolm Tucker then you may find this to your taste. Do not however blame me for how you react to the ending as you have been warned!",6,4,8,9 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Not Tarantino for his 90s fans.
","This movie appears to be splitting critics for some obvious reasons which are nothing to do with the quality of whats on offer.
This is not the 90s wham bam constant action to a groovy soundtrack with multiple plot twists Tarantino movie.
If thats what you think you are getting you will be disappointed. This is a more mature and skilled Tarantino affair in which your own knowledge of cinema will be rewarded if you have that background. Think of Marvel Easter eggs but for film buffs.
This is a high quality movie which has great dialogue without being overly preachy or Tarantino-esque and lush cinematography.
Its almost 2.45 hours long but doesnt feel too long, unless you were expecting a 90s Tarantino movie.
The mastery of the movie however is the story telling, you simply do not see coming what does and like Hitchcock, Tarantino is fantastic at building up tension. We expect the narrative to go one way however.....
In short you will need to see this before its ruined with spoilers.
It has been attacked on very simplistic, lazy and selfish identity politics reasoning.
We have critics who have attempted to quantize the value of female characters by using the metric of words spoken. However not by all the female characters just by one. Using this metric negates every other aspect of what an actor brings to the screen. If acting was judged on word count alone we would have some very odd looking movies. Its also telling that this highly selective metric is applied to only character. The odd thing is there are far more females in this movie than males. How does that add to the argument this is a sexist movie? Also the female characters are treated exactly the same as the males when they step out of line. If anything this movie does more to enhance the memory of Sharon Tate and extend her screen life than any identity politics rant that ignores facts in order to skew an audiences mind into not seeing the movie. The identity politics advocates real issue is that they did not like seeing women experience violence, they are loath to articulate this clearly so they label the movie as misogenistic. They know that if they did explicitly state this is that there are two main issues with this stance. Firstly that the Manson family are known for the murder of a pregnant woman and her child for no reason and secondly that they would be asking for special treatment for only the female Mansons, that is despite their violent intent they should be spared any violence because they are female. Clearly an immature position based on identity politics and laughably unfair. It appears they would rather see female Manson murderers get away it and receive therapy for their deeds instead of swift justice.
Also the other criticism seems to be about the fact you can see feet in the movie. However thats only an issue for those very odd people who hate feet, despite the fact they also have them.
I actually find these people stranger than foot fetishists.
This movie treats its female characters as equals throughout and enhances the public image of Sharon Tate.
This is a major success for Tarantino in 2019.
Its a very grown up movie for grown ups, ignore the identity politics brigade and the immature I hate feet people!",7,2,2,28 August 2019
1917," Solid but not groundbreaking.
","I was lucky to attend a preview screening of this for almost nothing. War movies are never my first choice. They either seem to be glorified body counts using high tech killing machines or preachy 'isn't war just terrible and we should all be ashamed' movies. This one is in the latter camp. This is a saving private Ryan style narrative minus the pyrotechnics of the opening scene. Two soldiers are selected to pass a message to a commander to halt and advance into a planned trap. The movie itself is basically about their journey and the overall emotion it conveys is one of tension. The problem I had with the movie is that the soldiers are basically inept. Every problem that they face is basically self inflicted and the result of bad decision making. Which makes it a little hard to be sympathetic. This is really a story about dumb luck and who does or doesn't have it.
It's well shot however it has less visual impact than the recent Peter Jackson effort which used real moving film. Which brings me to my next point. The tone of 1917 is very sombre while as the Peter Jackson documentary showed that wasn't always the case. For some reason its forbidden to show anyone smiling over anything in world war 1. This will earn high praise from the anti war middle-class that's lovely cinematography crowd. But many will be disappointed when the movie doesn't match the initial high scores of professional critics. Midway was a much more entertaining and emotionally engaging war movie.",6,2,3,15 January 2020
Jaws," Still hold up....more or less...
","Jaws was the original summer blockbuster movie. Its the story of a police chief who believes a shark is responsible for a number of unexplained deaths and his fight with a local mayor, who is worried that closing the resort to protect the public will destroy the local economy. 
However the action with the shark seems to have overtaken the rest of the narrative in many peoples minds due to the effectiveness of the shark scenes which terrified audiences at the time. Anyone who watched this movie in the past recalls the shark attacks but the main driver of the story, which was about officials arguing about financial survival versus public safety, is less well remembered. 
Many of the sequels of Jaws seemed to focus more on the shark action than narrative, which seems to have angered many of the fans of the original to the extent they have exaggerated how bad they sequels actually were. 
The thing is, the shark scenes, driven by the now famous score were only as effective as they were due to them having a shark which looked terrible on film. As a result its screen time was minimised which added to the air of menace. 
The cast in this movie is iconic. However many of the deaths come as less of a shock as they do in the second movie. In some cases not everyone who dies is a sympathetic character.....
Watching this movie in 2018, this is no longer a film which is as shocking as it would have been in 1975. Horror movies have moved on and this is now seen as more of a thriller than something that would deliver real scares. As such its viewed more in terms of being a decent quality movie with great characters but the effects etc may not scare your average cinema goer. Remember this was an A rating when it was released, it was then downgraded to a PG. It will likely still scare kids but adults not so much.
If you haven't already seen this movie where have you been? Its a genuine classic, just don't expect it to give you nightmares like it would have to audiences in the 70s.",7,0,0,24 September 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Anne Frank With Added Whimsy
","Having finally managed to find the time I decided to watch Jojo Rabbit, I had managed to avoid any trailers or spoilers. All I knew is who directed and the rough outline it was about the Nazis, Hitler in particular and was a surreal comedy.
What stood out about this prior to seeing it was a general mood that this was too difficult a movie to describe. However having watched it and in the main enjoyed it, its simply an updated Anne Frank style story with some humour thrown in.
Unfortunately it is not in the same league as Wilderpeople. Its good thats all not great. The humour mostly lands and in the main how you feel about the silly version of Hitler is likely how you will feel about this overall. A glaring mistake for me however was during the movie Hitler used a phrase which made reference to something which was actually contemporary which had a jarring effect as it spoiled the illusion of this being set during the war.
Despite it mainly being a comedy with most of the gags at the expense of the Nazis the final act does turn darker which may explain why so many didnt like this movie.I can understand why as it feels like two separate movies split by the final act.
Worth going to see but its not groundbreaking and the way its being sold to the public doesnt really fit with how it actually is. Its basically a rehash of Anne Frank with a few more gags.",6,1,4,23 January 2020
