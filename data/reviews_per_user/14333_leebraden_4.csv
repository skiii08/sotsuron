Walk the Line," Really Entertaining
",I didn't know much about Johnny Cash prior to this movie. I knew he was a country singer but didn't know the struggles he faced while he was younger. Growing up he had to watch his brother die and served in the air force when he was a young adult. He struggled with many addictions while he was touring and was a shadow of the man he once was. It was really interesting watching him go from the bottom barely scrapping by and struggling with supporting for his family. Then reaching the top with his music getting more and more popular and becoming a big star in the business. Then hitting the bottom again as he loses everything he had due to substance abuse. Watching him write his wrongs was a very inspirational story because for many people it is hard to come back from those addictions. And through all he put June through she was still by his side through everything.,7,1,1,29 January 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Exceeded Expectations
","This movie was visually stunning. I really liked comic feel and that was something that was joked about throughout the movie. This movie was both funny and action packed. It was really good at keeping your attention through the developing parts of the movie with funny jabs at mistakes Sony had made with Spider-man over the years. It was fun to watch this new take on a different version of Spider-man. This was one of the top super hero movies of the year, it will be interesting to see where Sony takes this story form here.",10,2,4,24 January 2019
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Boring and Slow
",I think portraying the movie in black and white was an awesome way to show the time period this movie takes place. I think the director did a really good job getting the setting right. The problems I have with this movie are just how slow and boring it is. This movie has hard shot after hard shot and is carried almost solely by dialogue. It was just a very redundant movie with the same thing taking place over and over again. Another thing is that whenever senator McCarthy was speaking they had it in the background of the movie. If this is the main conflict of the movie why is it being played in the background. I think this movie requires historical knowledge about the event for you to enjoy it. I watched this for a class and when the teacher would stop to give some background information the movie made more sense.,4,0,2,23 January 2019
Back to the Future," A classic
",This movie was released before I was born and was a classic my parents watched when they were teenagers. All this time later and they still hold up. The movie is fun. I really like the conflict with the past and present in this movie because it is just so fun to watch. I think they did a really good job portraying the two different generations. I think this movie will forever be a classic,9,1,1,4 February 2019
