The Avengers," My No.1 film
","I watched the trailer for this film and kept saying to myself 'i have to see this, it looks amazing.' Finally went to see it shortly after it was released in cinemas and was not disappointed one bit. It contained plenty of action and the humour certainly made it better.The Hulk smashed everything in site Thor went berserk with his hammer Captain America's shield is cool Iron Man - well - he took on all of those drones in the final battle, he managed to get a suit on in mid-air and he has the hottest girlfriend. So wish i was him. He was amazing. I think Robert Downey Jr suits the part of Tony Stark really well...its like the character was made for him and am definitely looking forward to Iron Man 3 next year along with an Avengers 2 if one is being made.I recommend this film to everyone who loves superheros and who loves action.",10,4,11,14 June 2012
