Lucky Number Slevin," A amazing film
","This film is a really amazing film, with twists and turns that get you thinking right until the end, and even when the film is finished you still wonder how everything is put together. All of the actors are amazing in this film. As far as action goes there is not a lot but as far as mystery goes its shear class. The film is also the perfect length to have your attention all the way, not very high budget stunts or effects but everything is done to perfection! I truly recommend that you see this film if you like the gangster/action genre.I have a true feeling that this will become one of them groundbreaking films just like pulp fiction! MUST SEE!!",10,5,15,26 February 2006
