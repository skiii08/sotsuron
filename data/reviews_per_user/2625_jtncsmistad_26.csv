10 Cloverfield Lane," '10 Cloverfield Lane': Have we been set up?
","'10 Cloverfield Lane' is Producer J.J. Abrams shrouded in secrecy sequel to the 2008 surprise found footage hit 'Cloverfield'. Sort of.Without completely surrendering the premise, there are thematic elements from the original which come to prominence in this amply anticipated follow-up widely released this weekend (3/11/16). But certainly not to the overarching degree that these aspects factored intrinsically into it's predecessor.John Goodman is a particularly peculiar survivalist/conspiracy theorist (like there's any other kind?) who takes Mary Elizabeth Winstead into his farmhouse bunker for 'safekeeping' in the wake of a violent car crash. John Gallagher Jr. is already a tenant of this cozy cum creepy underground community.Goodman is, as per usual, his reliable character actor self as Howard, a guy whom you never really know both if you can accept what he's saying as gospel (he claims the world above the trio has succumbed to a catastrophic chemical assault) or what in the living hell he may do next.Winstead has emerged as a personal favorite of mine. Her role as Michelle is one of a super sci-fi action hero here. It is a distinctly distant departure from previous impressive roles in substantially smaller scale productions including 'Smashed' and 'Alex of Venice'. Winstead proves in resounding fashion to be more than up to the formidable demands of this heretofore unexplored province of performance. Still, despite a couple of moving moments, it is decidedly disappointing that more of her considerable acting acumen was not on display in this story.'10 Cloverfield Lane' dutifully delivers it's fair share of twists and turns, scares and surprises and jumps and jolts to be sure. But in the end it couldn't help but feel as one long lead-up to a tacked on departure point for the next installment in the series. And I think that we as faithful fans expected and deserved just a little bit more than that.Wouldn't you agree, J.J.?",7,4,7,13 March 2016
Hereditary," 'Hereditary': Brutally Tough Watch...if you Dare.
","Toni Collette is searing in a viciously raw performance. The music by Colin Stetson is among the most frightening scores ever put to film. And the special effects are so viscerally realistic you MUST turn away.No, this deeply disturbing saga of Satanism and a family unspeakably tortured by a legacy of raging evil is not a horrible film. It is, however, one so harshly horrifying that it is difficult to recommend. Watch at your own risk. You have been warned.",4,0,7,16 September 2018
Detroit," 'Detroit': Madness in The Motor City
","I was a child during the hell on earth Detroit summer of 1967. I don't remember it. Acclaimed Director Kathryn Bigelow has done one helluva job recreating the powder keg that exploded over a half century ago in the based-on-actual-events drama 'Detroit'. It is profoundly difficult to process that a human being could be as recklessly racist as these rogue cops are. Will Poulter is particularly chilling as the brazen ring leader. That these white officers of the law could treat mostly black suspects as lives that scarcely matter is sickening. Yet, as the disturbing courtroom scenes reveal toward the end of the film, how do we know?",6,3,6,12 March 2018
In Bruges," If you like your movies PC then you're gonna hate on 'In Bruges'
","If you like your comedy dark, as in pitch black tar dark, then 'In Bruges' is for you. Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell are an unlikely pair of hit men hiding out in the titular quaint Belgian hamlet after a job gone horrifically awry. And while Gleeson plays against his standard surly sort as he kills 'em with kindness and Farrell is a riot as a shampoo for brains shooter, this odd and ominous story didn't ultimately come together as I'd hoped it might. There were moments of laugh out loud levity. And then there were scenes of malicious mayhem and deep despondency. Alas, the jarring juxtaposition of this deviant divergence just didn't jive in the end to fully satisfy.Still, in keeping with the sardonic underpinning of 'In Bruges', let us all be clear, shall we? It's dwarf. Got it? Dwarf.",6,0,2,10 July 2016
Wind River," 'Wind River': Murder with a Message on 'The Res'
","I love, love......LOVE......Elizabeth Olsen. I can pretty much take or leave Jeremy Renner. Their performances are equally exemplary (Renner's best work yet for my money) in the crime thriller 'Wind River'.Olsen play's greenhorn FBI Agent Jane Banner. She is dispatched from the Las Vegas bureau to investigate the murder of a teenage girl on a Wyoming Native American Reservation. Once on 'The Res' she winds up teamed with Renner's character, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 'hunter' Cory Lambert. Together they trek through blinding snowstorms and brutal backcountry in search of a killer. The acting is solid, the suspense sufficient and the scenery as intimidating as it is breathtaking throughout 'Wind River'. Yet what resonates most is the enduring message that the indigenous citizens of our country continue to suffer a shamefully raw deal.",8,0,1,13 January 2018
Green Room," 'Green Room': Code Red in The Great Pacific Northwest.
","Didn't think I really needed to see the skinhead suspenser (yep, I damn well may have JUST NOW invented this oddball genre description) 'Green Room'. And perhaps I didn't. But now that I have, there are worse ways to while away an hour and a half of living.Here's what I found worthwhile about the experience. It showcases the beauty of my stomping grounds, the stunning American Pacific Northwest. It features some cool punk rock AND Credence Clearwater Revival. And the mere presence of the great Patrick Stewart is more than enough to class up this, or any other, joint.There are confusing scene sequences, unlikely plot developments and scads of interchangeable neo-Nazi dummkopfs proliferating throughout 'Green Room'. But so what? There are certainly enough scares and acts of mayhem going' on here to run a charge or two through most folks.And if that's not enough to suit ya, then, in the lexicon of the prevailing mentality of the film, 'F--- it, man.'",6,0,3,21 August 2016
Us," 'Us': Grim Reminder that it could always be Worse...
","The Coen Brothers, Atom Egoyan, Shane Carruth and now Jordan Peele. This is my short list of favorite film directors ever.Peele's latest deep and deliciously demented dive into modern society is 'Us'. There are many messages to be mined in this movie, all woven expertly into a decidedly disturbing yet darkly comic story.My key takeaway? No matter how bad you think you may have it in life, there is an alternate path which would have led you to something far more unbearable. And, as Peele so ingeniously reveals both literally and figuratively in 'Us', it's not that far, or that different, from hell.",7,0,5,28 June 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," 'Bohemian Rhapsody': Captivating Chronicle of a Band and it's Fabled Frontman
","I actually witnessed the rock group Queen perform live with Freddy Mercury as front man not once but twice.The new biopic 'Bohemian Rhapsody' portrays the legendary lead singer as a caricature much of the time. Because HE portrayed himself as a caricature. To us. However, the film allows the human being behind the faÃ§ade to reveal his soul, as well. It just chooses not to belabor the point.Mercury had reckless unprotected sex with countless men. We get it by way of several scenes in 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. And he was a vain, albeit massively insecure, prima donna. These points are established without beating us about the noggin about it.Much of the film's rousing soundtrack presented music I surprisingly wasn't familiar with. It was a most pleasant revelation. I've already downloaded these and several other songs from the iconic band for repeated listening enjoyment.And the music of the group is the point.Point, forevermore, well taken.",9,5,6,17 November 2018
The Thing," Don't wait as long as I did to see this Thing!
","I can't believe it has taken me this long to FINALLY see John Carpenter's 1982 cult Sci-Fi Horror classic 'The Thing'. Actually, I CAN, as this is not the type of genre to which I'm typically drawn. This said, there's this other realization I also can't quite believe now. And that is just how damn much I LIKED it!! The CAST for gosh sake! Okay, first of all Kurt Russell is a TOTAL bad ass as the leader vs. the creature among a bunch of guys encamped at a research outpost in Antarctica. But then here are only a handful of the veteran actor upper echelon who go to battle alongside Russell: Wilford Brimley (sans beard), Richard Dysart, David Clennon and Richard Masur. Hey, when you've got true pros like this workin' for ya the credibility quotient of any horror flick, hell, ANY flick at ALL, clicks on up the quality pole a couple of full notches at least.And there simply aren't enough superlatives to commend the absolutely astonishing job contributed by the special effects, visual effects and makeup crews here. Their cumulative brilliance had me constantly aghast at the abhorrently repulsive and terrifyingly petrifying shape-shifting monsters these folks so ingeniously conjured up for the exclusive purpose of completely grossing us the F--- out! Toss in the unsettlingly creepish music scored by Ennio Morricone and Carpenter has constructed one of the most near-perfect dread fests of all-time.I am not one to beg. However, PLEASE, if you've put off experiencing 'The Thing' like yours truly had for so long, I PLEAD with you to watch it. And even if you like the film only half as much as me, that still means that you got a pretty stout kick in the butt out of the whole deal. And if you don't like it...well...then...perhaps that's 'the thing' I just can't explain!",8,1,3,19 December 2016
Split," No 'Split' decision here-this Shyamalan shocker shines
","Finally got 'round to scoping out 'Split'. My foremost takeaway? Well AWRITE M. Night! Shyamalan doin' what he does best as a Writer and Director here-keeping it simple, swift and sinister-shows that my man hasn't completely lost his propensity for suspense and scares. He coaxes primo performances from James McAvoy as a deeply damaged schizophrenic and Betty Buckley (one of THE hottest TV mom's EVER on the '70's series 'Eight Is Enough') as his/her shrink.May I suggest clinging closely to this tried and true formula, MNS. After all, it's not like it hasn't served you well up to now or anything, dude.",7,1,4,26 June 2017
Goon," 'Goon': A Power Play of laughs, drama & hellacious hockey action
","With the NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs getting under way this week (of 4/10/16), I thought it would be fun to dip into the archives for my review of the 2011 dramedy hockey flick 'Goon'.Right off the bat (or 'stick' in the case of this hockey comedy/drama) I thought that 'Goon' was going to be really stupid and that I'd made a big mistake in ordering the DVD. But I decided to give it a chance. And I'm glad I did.This is a flick that could have been a silly and over-the-top throwaway. But thankfully the film makers together with a commendable cast took the story in a whole different direction. And they wound up with a fresh and engaging take on friendship, love and loyalty.Seann William Scott is blissfully ignorant as a man/child with the capacity to become a fearsome enforcer. His character says those bluntly candid things we all would like to if we didn't have a filter. Alison Pill is his too-cute-to-take girlfriend who falls helplessly for the big guy's honestly innocent charm. The seemingly ever-under appreciated Liev Schreiber delivers a memorable turn as an aging hockey thug giving it one last roundhouse swing as he rides the downhill slide to the end of a black-and-blue career. And Jay Baruchel is just flat-out funny and whacked-out as hell as Scott's best friend.Be cautioned, however. The violence is jarring and brutal. But, hey, no one ever confused Pro Hockey with playing patty-cake.This one could have been mindless. The good news is that it not only has a brain, but a big ol' heart to go along with it.",7,0,0,16 April 2016
Legend," 'Legend' stars a Legend in the Making in a FAR less than legendary movie.
","I love this guy. Love, love, love, love, LOVE him. Ever since being thoroughly stunned by his astonishing one-man tour de force performance in 'Locke' I have been a gigantic fan. He is gifted, multi-dimensional and compelling. He is Tom Hardy. And he just may be the best actor alive.So established, I regret to say that I definitely did NOT love Hardy's 2015 dual role project 'Legend'. Oh, HE was outstanding as usual in bringing us both Reginald AND Ronald Kray, the real life identical twin brothers who ruthlessly ruled the gangster roost in 1960's London. The problem is that the story, along with this production, is stultifyingly bleak and doggedly despondent. Add to this that there is never any effort dedicated to fleshing out a backstory, nor is there nary a cursory attempt to explain how these repugnant thugs became consumed by a life rife with crime and terrorization while apparently establishing and wielding absolute power over all competition along with Scotland Yard.Consequently, it is damn near impossible to recommend that anyone watch 'Legend'. Even WITH two times the Hardyness to behold.Reg and Ron each rotted and died in prison, as well they should have. And it sure as hell wasn't getting any more pleasant for either one of them after they perished.But did we really need a spirit-smashing movie like 'Legend' to inform us that these abominable snakes once slithered about our earth in the first place?",4,2,3,23 November 2016
Get Out," 'Get Out': You will want In
","Thought about it. For awhile. And this is the genre I decided upon for the super strange suspense flick 'Get Out'. 'Socioracial Horror'. Yep. Pretty sure I just made that up. But that's what I'm going' with.I'm not exactly certain what Writer/Director Jordan Peele was aiming for message-wise here, only that he succeeds wildly for the most part in crafting an unnerving potboiler vibe right from the ghastly get-go. The hallmark of any top-notch thriller no matter the plot is to keep us guessing, anticipating what in the hell we may watch go down next. Peele does this in expert fashion. And does it in spades.And if you've seen, or now plan to see, 'Get Out', please understand that I certainly do NOT mean that as any 'socioracial' play on words.The intent resides strictly in the superlative sense.",7,3,5,2 July 2017
Room," 'Room': Tour De Force Performances tell a Brutal Story of Survival.
","After God's love for us all, a mother's love for her child is the most powerful force in our universe. Never is this inestimable strength more explosively in evidence than in the relentlessly gripping domestic drama 'Room'.Brie Larson unequivocally earns her Best Actress Oscar as Ma, a young woman who at 17 is kidnapped by a sick fu-- and held as a sex slave in a suburban backyard garden shed for the better part of a decade. During this time she bears a son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay in a stunning and utterly natural performance). For five years this boy believes the 'real world' consists only of this 11 x 11 foot prison he and his mom inhabit. Until the day that Ma stuns him with the declaration that there is a vast and diverse existence beyond the four walls of 'room'. And she hatches a plan that may just lead to at long last freedom from the sinister oppression of the evil incarnate 'Old Nick'.At this point in the story Director Lenny Abrahamson takes us on the rocky journey experienced by survivors of unspeakable trauma, both from the perspectives of those who lived through the ordeal and those whose lives were devastated in the 'not knowing'. It is here where Larson and Tremblay, along with the great Joan Allen as Ma's mother, Nancy, and Tom McCamus as her partner in particular, shine with poignant ferocity amidst a consumptive crucible of relief, remorse and regret. And never is there a false note struck among the emotional carnage.As 'Room' concludes we find Ma and Jack together gaining at least some measure of closure to the horror that has befallen them. And while it is certainly not a happy ending by any standard, it is nonetheless one of, while admittedly tenuous, hope for the future. And considering what may have been in this oh so sad chronicle, this represents infinitely more than we as an audience could have hoped for at the outset of this deeply moving examination of the triumph of the human spirit.",8,0,1,7 May 2016
Pawn Sacrifice," 'Pawn Sacrifice': Maguire & Zwick make Chess Exciting...Really!
","Tobey Maguire is superb as the late chess phenom Bobby Fischer. It's a damn tall order to make a movie about chess compelling, but Maguire and Director Edward Zwick (TV's 'thirtysomething', 'The Last Samurai') manage to pull it off with panache to burn.This is an absolutely scintillating yet ultimately sad tale of a genius who could not dig out from under an avalanche of family resentment, crippling self castigation, massive ego and unchecked mental illness following his 1972 landmark victory over Soviet arch-rival Boris Spassky. Those who know one whole helluva lot more about the 'King's Game' than I maintain that this wunderkind from Brooklyn is the best the world has ever known.Or may ever.",8,1,4,24 March 2016
La La Land," 'La La Land': Fa la la la la la la la FUN!
","I am far from your typical RomCom Musical Movie sorta guy. This notwithstanding, there are exceptions to every rule. And the 2016 mega-hit from a genre generally gone by, 'La La Land', would be a rare one indeed for me in this regard.Writer/Director Damien Chazelle has fashioned a bit of beatific and, at once, bittersweet brilliance. And all the while he pays both subtle and blatant homage to the multitude of merry musicals circa the golden era of the 1950's and '60's. Ryan Gosling is very good, Emma Stone, better for my money, as star-crossed lovers who I found myself willingly suckered into rooting to see get together in the end. For those who have yet to see the film, far be it for me to divulge if this cute and crazy couple actually do wind up living happily, and tunefully, ever after. I shall only share that the entire intricate production satisfied both fully and with flying colors after all was said, sung and done.And, to quote the late, great John Lennon-a dude who knew a little something about music himself-it 'done me good'.",8,0,1,9 January 2018
Don't Breathe," 'Don't Breathe': Not as simple as Good Guys vs. Bad Guys.
","How can we genuinely root for either 'side' in the crime thriller 'Don't Breathe'? Both are reprehensible. And yet each in their own way also manage to stimulate an investment of pathos and pity.On the one hand we have the trio of desperate young folks, whom life has collectively exploded a big ol' gigantic sh-- bomb all over while they slowly disintegrate in the dregs of Detroit. We feel for these kids, yeah. But not overly so. After all, it is of their own free will that they engage in a series of suburban home break-in robberies, with the most unstable among them the only one who is armed. Not exactly keen inspiration for advocacy on behalf of the audience with this boorish bunch, is there? Enter the other component in the equation presented in 'Don't Breathe'. He is 'The Blind Man', a Gulf War vet who lost his eyesight in battle fighting for his country, and whose misfortune is compounded by the tragic loss of his only child, a daughter who was accidentally run down by a car. Instant sympathy for this sorrowful soul, right? Ah, but not so fast. Consider that this guy is also liable for kidnapping, imprisonment and torture, all within the creepy confines of his dilapidated domicile, and even the most compassionate among us are given pause to reconsider our position.So, given the respective parties in 'Don't Breathe', it is for us, then, to examine and assess where we come down regarding any potential allegiances as we watch the grim and grisly proceedings play out in this house of horrors.Until, at last, it is game over.Or IS it?......",7,1,4,4 December 2016
Sicario," 'Sicario'. Merciless Means. Yet is there an End?
","At times (and it seems these times happen FAR too often) we all find ourselves checking to see how long a movie has until it ends, freeing us at long last from some manner of misery. And then there are cinematic gifts like 'Sicario'. Man, I NEVER wanted this brilliantly brutal masterpiece chronicling the down and dirty business of fighting Mexican drug trafficking to frickin' ever FINISH! Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin and Daniel Kaluuya. Uniformly exceptional performances from each of these TRUE pros in every sense of what this word stands for. One minor quibble. I REALLY would have liked to see Director Dennis Villeneuve focus in greater detail on Del Toro's agonizingly tormented character Alejandro. 'Sicario', the exquisite model of top-tier movie making that it is, could have been considerably better served through more concentration invested in and close-ups of a man whose soul is condemned to be interminably tortured whether or not he exacts at last the vengeance he stalks with such fierce and unbridled commitment. Del Toro is certainly that class of actor who I believe could have given us even more to remember in an already tour de force performance.However unsavorily gained, U.S. law enforcement ultimately scores a major victory in 'Sicario'. The film's final images portray a seemingly innocent scene of a bunch of kids being cheered on by their moms while playing soccer in the Mexican dirt. The abrupt and menacing 'time out' delivers a stark and sobering punch to the gut with the reality that this insidious war on drugs rages on.Brolin's character warns us earlier in this harrowing story that as long as 20% of Americans are consumers of the commodity at the core of this ruthless combat the fight must continue. Which leaves us to struggle with the enduring and deeply disturbing question...How, then, is it EVER going to end?",9,4,7,14 February 2016
The Witch," 'The Witch': I gotta make a Switch, People
","I really need to start reviewing more comedies, man. Watching the downtrodden early American supernatural domestic drama 'The Witch' directly on the heels of enduring 'Hereditary' has damn near got me inserting my head into a blazing hot oven. And leaving it there.Well done movies, both. Yet there's only so much dismalness and despondency the kid can take. But if for some reason you ever find yourself yearning for an anecdote to joy...well you just have at 'em there, pardner.Killjoy.",4,1,2,25 September 2018
Arrival," 'Arrival': A 'Little Green Men Land on Earth' Saga for the Thoughtful
","'Arrival' is the story of a global alien invasion. Though this is far from the familiar fodder of 'our planet is in peril from intergalactic creatures intending malice and mayhem'. Instead, Director Denis Villeneuve ('Sicario') has fashioned an intriguingly different approach, one of a foreign force from the far reaches of outer space whose primary intent seems to lie in occupying and manipulating the human mind and soul.And while it is about 25 or 30 minutes too long, the dialogue is often muddled (not counting that of the giant intruders) and several of the scenes are so dark it is a real struggle to distinguish what exactly is happening, I found 'Arrival' to be a mostly creditable use of nigh on two hours of my earthly existence.Amy Adams ('Nocturnal Animals') is quite good here as Louise Banks, a linguistics expert who is charged by the U.S. military with the monumental task of attempting to ascertain what it is that these who have trespassed against us are efforting to communicate. What she ends up learning will profoundly change her life. This discovery is viewed almost as a blessing in the context of the narrative. However I, perhaps like you, can only consider the 'gift' that these space travelers have bestowed upon Ms. Banks to be nothing other than what I daresay it would represent to the balance of us.An insidious curse.",7,1,6,6 March 2017
The Big Short," 'The Big Short' is long on all the gory details and lotsa fast-paced entertainment!
","I had heard that Director Adam McKay ('Anchorman', 'Anchorman 2') takes the colossally complicated details of the catastrophic 2007 U.S. housing crash and parcels out the grim details to the audience of his extraordinary film 'The Big Short' in unusually palatable ways. As soon as I saw the fetching Margot Robbie explaining a portion of these perplexing particulars while enjoying a bubble bath and drinking champagne served from a (no doubt most grateful) butler, McKay had me eating up what he was serving with just a big ass appreciative spoon! 'The Big Short' is a two-hour-plus dissection of and dissertation on greed and unspeakable institutional incompetence and arrogance that succeeds in never once feeling as if it is dragging on. Not an easy trick to pull off. And all credit for doing so, and in stunningly spectacular fashion, goes to McKay's snappy style and breakneck pace working in seamless tandem with flawless ensemble performances from the superstar stable of Bale, Carell, Gosling and Pitt. Each actor absolutely nails their real-life character here as they collectively make a financial killing at the expense of the American homeowner and right under the clueless upturned noses of the nation's banking and mortgage industries along with a feeble federal government.Any film that can (and almost without realizing it is happening) have you veritably rooting for these self-serving guys who see themselves as merely taking advantage of an insidiously flawed system whose pompous proprietors are fast asleep at the wheel is doing something right.Even if nearly everyone involved in this seedy story is doing practically nothing but dead wrong.",9,4,5,22 May 2016
The Conjuring," 'The Conjuring': Man, that Ending packs a helluva Wallop
","I am a big fan of Vera Farmiga. Not so much Patrick Wilson. That said, the two veteran actors are excellent together as real life ghost chasers Lorraine and Ed Warren in this based on a true story imagining of the couple's 1971 experience battling violently malevolent spirits in a family's remote farmhouse.While the tone is unsettling and disturbing throughout, what we witness in the final twenty minutes of 'The Conjuring' will blast you right square in the jaw as the Warren team gives it all they got to kick the holy hell out of evil.Movies are great.",7,0,1,2 June 2019
Straight Outta Compton," 'Straight Outta Compton': Stark Examination of Rise & Fall of American Music Pioneers N.W.A. deserved more Oscar Love
","I needed to see 'Straight Outta Compton'. Not because I'm a fan of the music. Not because I embrace the mentality inherent in such. Not because I am familiar at all with the ruthless ghetto reality that inspired the songs. I needed to see it because I understood that it's a hell of a movie. And it is.I also understand that the members of the Academy of Arts and Sciences did not deign this film worthy of neither a Best Picture nor any Best Acting Oscar nominations. And to paraphrase the real life characters composing the '80's pioneering rap band N.W.A. in this captivating story, 'That's some real sh--, man.' Nothing wrong with being in your 60's, male and white as most of the Academy voters reportedly are. The problem is when you have absolutely no intimation as to what is happening on screen and can consequently generate no semblance of appreciation for it.The exceptional performances in 'Compton ' were thoroughly authentic, resonate and impactful. The hardcore rap and hip hop music featured in this production have significantly influenced our culture to this day. To formally ignore such a superb chronicle of how this came to be is nothing short of shameful.Race does not a good movie make. Quality of purpose sure as hell does.",8,3,28,5 March 2016
Rear Window," Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' is at the front of the line of Classic Suspensers.
","Boy, could that James Stewart ever carry a movie in the dude's prime? That answer would be an unequivocal HELL YEAH! This is precisely what the legendary actor does as his hobbled photographer turned opportunistic voyeur character of Jeff is integral to nearly every single scene in Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1954 mystery thriller 'Rear Window'. I'm not going to launch into detail regarding plot and such as you, unlike me, have in all probability seen this film before, if not several times.I will simply say that ol' Al, along with a uniquely twisted sense of both the macabre and of human nature, also had quite the natural knack for comic relief in the form of sly sexual innuendo and salacious double entendre to go right along with his mastery of suspense.Oh, I suppose I could nitpick on conspicuous aspects along the lines of a window reveals what's on both sides of the pane. And hey, Raymond Burr, as you advanced upon a wheelchair-bound Jimmy with extreme menace toward the finish of the flick, did it not occur to you to shut your eyes when you knew the flash was coming? But why niggle? This is such a suck-you-in story that is at once so damn fun and funny only a horse's as...uh, 'rear'...would fish to find fault in it.",7,0,2,5 October 2016
Annihilation," 'Annihilation': Tear it Down and Start Again
","What if the human race got a do-over? This seems to be the overarching premise of the fascinating and fantastic sci-fi drama 'Annihilation'.What is indisputable is that the five actresses who play the leads in this film are individually and collectively exceptional. Don't call them bad ass babes. And don't you dare call this a 'chick flick'. What these ladies, in real life and by way of their fine performances, SHOULD be called, as a wise man of few words, my beautiful father, would say, is 'substantial'.And Dad would mean that as a supreme compliment.",7,1,3,8 June 2019
The Martian," 'The Martian' unleashes the forever ferocious spirit of The U.S. Space Program.
","My dad helped put Americans on the moon. He is a fiercely proud retired NASA engineer. As his son, and if it's even POSSIBLE, I am even MORE proud of the remarkable and historic milestones my father and his fellow NASA teammates achieved both in outer space as well as right here on earth.'The Martian' is a testament to the inherent talent, commitment, resolve and enduring grit and determination that continues to drive and inspire the United States Space Program toward both unexplored horizons and indelible greatness. Such magnificence does not come without a cost, however. It never has, nor was this ever guaranteed.As the movie's star, Matt Damon is an astronaut who believes in his mission, THE mission, so completely as to risk his very life in ferocious commitment to honoring it. His raw and riveting performance personifies all of what makes my dad and, by bonded blood, me, SO damn proud to be part of something that has always been, to quote Damon's courageous castaway character Mark Watney, 'bigger than me.'",9,1,3,28 February 2016
