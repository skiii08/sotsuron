The Blair Witch Project," An excellently horrifying thriller
","A lot of the people I saw Blair Witch Project with had never learned or had any experience with voodoo or witchcraft.  I think that those people were seriously shorted of an excellent movie.I loved how the directors used a subjective point of view throughout the film... it really brings the audience into the plot.  It hasn't been used for a long time, and it was very natural.I don't think that the movie gave enough information about the spells and meanings of some of the symbols in the movie however. There are short shots of particular objects and writing that are not really explained.  Giving the audience the background information about the power or meaning of each object the characters find would have significantly changed the reaction of the audience.Overall, the movie is one of the best horrors I have ever seen. To anyone who is even remotely interested in seeing this movie, do so in the theaters... it won't be as good on video with the subjective point of view. Before you go, soak up some voodoo/witchcraft information.  Your experience will be 75% more satisfying.",10,1,2,9 August 1999
