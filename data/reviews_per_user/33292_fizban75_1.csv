Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pretty good for the most part, but loses some of the human feel in the emphasis on special effects
","I liked the movie. How could I not. I'm a Star Wars fan. But I think that there is too much emphasis on the technology involved in making the film and not on the actors involved in making the film. I think that Jar Jar was annoying and not 'real' enough. His voice and animation were terrible. Too much movement! I would have preferred a live actor in a suit, similar to Chewbacca. Voice choices for the the battle droids was terrible also. Too comic and not threatening enough.Other than those things, I enjoyed my time at the movie. The way I looked at it, the movie did for me what it was supposed to do.
