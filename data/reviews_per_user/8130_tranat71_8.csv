It," Surprisingly good
","I have not read this Stephen King novel.I have seen the older 'It' TV miniseries when I was a kid.Overall, I would say that this new 'It' is a pretty good movie when compared to all movies.Compared to other horror movies, I think 'It' is better than most of them. Of course, 'It' is nowhere near as good as 'Shawshank Redemption' or 'Green Mile' as a movie in general. Shawshank was meant to win the Oscars. Shawshank is in a class all by itself. Green Mile was also meant to be included with Oscar talks, although not in the same league as Shawshank. 'It' is just meant to be entertaining as a horror movie. Nothing more. I still like 'The Dark Tower' movie better than 'It'.So this year, I saw 4 Stephen King movies: 'It', 'The Dark Tower', 'Gerald's Game', and '1922'.I like all 4 movies, and I would rank 'The Dark Tower' #1, 'It' #2, 'Gerald's Game' #3, and '1922' #4.",9,1,5,3 November 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," The most imbecilic Spiderman movie to date
","This is the most imbecilic Spiderman movie to date.Actually, it is the worst comic book movie to date. It's basically a bunch of one-liners with an extremely weak plot with tons of holes. All the characters are annoying as hell.After 30 minutes, I just wanted all the characters to die and the movie to end. It is THAT pathetic of a movie. You will just have to see it for yourself, but don't get too excited and don't expect anything good.This is one of the worst movies of the year.It is annoying as hell. Every single character in this movie is annoying as hell. I already mentioned that, but it deserves to be over-emphasized. It felt like a 4 hour movie because it is boring beyond belief and annoying as hell. Iron-man could not save this movie. All the Avengers and Marvel heroes probably couldn't have save this movie.",1,9,13,17 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The reviews are 1000% more entertaining than this movie
","The name 'DISNEY' is now permanently associated with 'Worst Piece of Crap'.So any movie that has the word 'Disney' attached to it will be pure crap.With all the money Disney has, you would think they could afford the best writers and directors and actually let those writers and directors do their jobs.But it's Disney. They are made up of imbeciles. They can't help themselves.It's like a GEICO commercial. Disney does Stupid. It's what they do. But hey, I just saved 15% on my car insurance. Haha.",1,12,20,11 February 2020
Baby Driver," Pretty good movie
","I would agree that it is a pretty good movie.But I also think it is probably over-hyped. I don't think this movie is anything 'masterful' or so unique. I liked a few songs in the movie. But the problem is that I didn't care any of the characters in the movie. When I think of 'super cool' and 'masterpiece', I think of movies like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Matrix'.I would not put 'Baby Driver' in this category of being super cool & masterful.",7,2,5,3 August 2017
Dunkirk," A very good movie
","I will watch every movie that Christopher Nolan (and Clint Eastwood) directs.I think Christopher Nolan and Clint Eastwood are probably the best directors of all times. With that being said, I prefer movies like The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, and Interstellar over war movies.I think Dunkirk is a very good movie, but probably only because Christopher Nolan directed it. I think this movie would be be pretty bad if someone else had directed it (Clint Eastwood would have also made it very good).So what exactly am I trying to say? I think the story itself is kind of boring. 330,000+ allied troops were trapped on Dunkirk and the Germans could have annihilated them. Somehow the Germans screwed up and allowed the allied troops to escape. It was a miracle for sure. Of course, I'm glad those evil Germans didn't kill the allied troops. But other than that, it's boring story, probably because it is faithful to the actual events and not some fiction to make it more exciting.",8,0,9,3 August 2017
1917," What a stupid movie
","First, I usually love war movies. They are among my favorite genres.My criteria for judging isn't about accuracy. It's about plot, character development, and the usual good story telling.I loved Dances with Wolves, Saving Private Ryan, Midway. I even liked Hacksaw Ridge even though I thought it was pretty stupid for a person not to carry a gun in a war.But this '1917' movie was just stupid. It's poor copy of 'Dances with Wolves', 'Saving Private Ryan', and 'Hacksaw Ridge'. Probably a copycat of other war movies too, but 3 examples is good enough.Dances with Wolves - remember the beginning scenes where Kevin Costner gets on his horse and rides across the battle ground where the enemy could take open shots at him? Yeah, just watch toward the end of '1917' and you will see what I mean. So stupid.Saving Private Ryan - remember how they were on a mission to save private Ryan? In '1917' it's another brother they want to find.Hacksaw Ridge - remember how the main character doesn't like violence so he refuses to shoot anyone or even carry a gun? Pretty stupid in a war? Yeah? What would you do if your ENEMY's plane came crashing down in a flame of fire in front of you? The same ENEMY that would KILL you in a heartbeat? Would you try to SAVE your ENEMY's life and risk getting blown up or catch on fire or something else? Yeah. 
No wonder that stupid 'Parasite' movie won at the Oscars. There are just too many stupid movies being nominated.",1,7,10,3 March 2020
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Excellent Comic Book Movie
","In terms of comic book movies, I've only liked Watchmen, The Dark Knight trilogy, Punisher, and the Wolverine movies because I felt they were more serious, mature, dark, and more R-rated.I never liked the other comic book movies such as X-Men, Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Avengers, Iron-Man, Captain America, or Thor because I thought they were too light and fluffy and too PG-rated.Just like in the 2nd season of Marvel's Daredevil, I loved it when The Punisher and Elektra were on screen and didn't really care for Daredevil because he's too much of a Boy Scout. I mean seriously, who would fight sword-wielding ninjas with sticks? When villains come at this new Batman with a gun, he doesn't respond with a slingshot. When people come at this new Batman with a knife, he doesn't respond with a stick. When people fire machine guns at this Batman, he answers with his own machine guns. BvS doesn't try to lecture politics or preach good vs evil. It makes no apologies for its uninhibited realism. It immerses the audience in this dark and dire DC universe. And I thank Zack Snider for this. Thank you for Watchen, 300, and now BvS. I forgive you for Man of Steel. No comic book movie is ever perfect. Watchmen came the closest IMO. And BvS came a close second. I think the people (both users and critics) who disliked BvS just didn't understand this movie, especially the ending of the movie. Overall, I truly enjoyed this movie and I look forward to watching Wonder Woman and the Justice League movies (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg).",10,4,8,26 March 2016
Annihilation," It could be worse
","Overall, I was okay with this movie.It wasn't a great movie like his 1st movie - Ex Machina. There are some things about it I didn't find logical, but I don't think it was as dumb as some movies like the latest Aliens movies where imbeciles would stick their faces into alien eggs. This movie felt very different that other alien movies. In contrast, all the 'Alien' movies have about the same plot. It didn't piss me off like some movies, so I wouldn't say that it's a bad movie.I think it's worth checking out.",8,2,5,15 March 2018
