Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I liked the Phantom Menace, though not as much as the first three.
","Now don't get me wrong- I LOVED the new Star Wars.  I've seen it four times- so far.  However it did not live up to the first three, this to me is obvious.  Here is a list of positives and negatives.  I'll start with negatives so that I can end this with positive things.Negative*The second line of the movie: 'Yes sir.  With all due respect . . .'. The pilot seemed so out of place.  When I saw the movie my stomach clenched at that point.  The pilots seemed like rejects out of Star Trek, not Star WARS heros.*The beginning started too fast, there was no lead up to the first battle.*I'll approach THIS issue with caution.  Jar-Jar Binks. hmmm. He was . . . OK.  I didn't LIKE him but I didn't hate him either.  What really annoyed me was when he was given the spotlight for more than a few seconds.  He was great as a backup character with lines like 'We ain't got no Mulah'.  But anytime he tried to spark a conversation it usually turned to disaster.  (also I hated it when he stuck his tongue out.  What was THAT about??*Boss Nass doing his slobber thingy.  I don't know why he had to do that. He was an AWESOME character otherwise.That was IT.  Now for positive stuff.*Once they reached Tatooine the movie stabalized and got great.*the Pod Race- excellent.*the music throughout the movie.*Jar-Jar; an excellent computer-generated character!  I liked the motion, I like the voice.  I just didn't like how he had nothing important to say.*I was really impresed with the conversation between Jar-Jar and Queen Amidala.  'yousa thinkin' Yousa people gonna DIE?' It was the most humanistic aspect of the whole movie.  Ironic that it was brought through Jar-Jar, a non-human.  It was also the only part of the movie where I truly LIKED Jar-Jar.  THe book presented Jar-Jar as a good character, he was sad when nobody like him.  In the movie he was presented as an emotionless creature who's only character trait was that he was clumsy.*Watto- awesome.  He was very cool.  I liked every aspect of him.  I think he should have hated to lose Anakin for more than money reasons, though. I think he should have been a little - fond of the boy, and miss him in a more fatherly sense as well. *The lightsaber duel.  Masterfully put together.  Absolutely cool.  Worth seeing the movie just for the last 15 min.All in all, I give STAR WARS Episode One: The Phantom Menace a B+ rating. 8.5 out of 10.  OF course I cut it a little slack because I wanted it to be good ( :P)",Null,0,0,8 July 1999
