Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," high five...
","I just had a chance to see this movie last week at a test screening and I must say I think it is the funniest thing I have ever seen on the big screen. I hope the final version includes the racier scenes and the MPAA doesn't pressure them to edit it (but they would surely be included on the DVD release). Basically it is a two hour journey following Borat across the U.S while he meets and greets all sorts of characters along the way. I don't want to give anything away but it manages to capture the hilarity of Borat from Da Ali G Show and hold it for the entire film. I was worried before I saw it because movies have a way of destroying all expectations brought forth from another medium but this film lives up to the challenge. Anyone who is a fan of the show will find themselves on the edge of their seats, trying not to spray urine on those close to them. We ran into Sacha after the screening and he gave us word that the release date was sometime over the summer, nothing specific but definitely something to look forward to.",10,372,758,5 February 2006
Friday Night Lights," A football movie for the ages
","Saw this movie as a sneak preview in cinema class yesterday and I was pretty blown away by the the action scenes as well as the story. Berg did a great job filming, lots of it is filmed with an unsteady hand cam type style which really draws you into the action. It is a touching story but not to the point of sappyness like Remember the Titans. I didn't read the book so I'm not sure how it compares but it is one hell of a movie. The acting is great as well, Billy Bob came into our class to talk about the movie and said that he didn't meet the real coach before filming because he wanted to have his own style, and he does. He does a great job playing a coach, very believable and he has so much talent. The kids are great as well, they do a very convincing job and will have a bright acting future ahead. Bottom line: if you like football or any kind of sports movie for that movie, you should love this one. Don't worry, it's not at all like Varsity Blues. Beautifully filmed and acted, I haven't seen as great or touching a sports movie in a long long time, it was like the emotion of Rudy but the action scenes of Any Given Sunday (but much better), I thought it made for a great combination. Go see it, it'll be a sports movie for the ages. As a side not, in the locker room scene when Billy Bob is giving the emotional talk to/about Boobie Miles, pay attention because the real Boobie Miles is standing right next to him, it makes it extra heart wrenching. Enjoy!",Null,0,2,1 October 2004
