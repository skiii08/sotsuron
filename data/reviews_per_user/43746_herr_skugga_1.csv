Casablanca," ''Here's looking at you kid'' - One of the greatest in Cinema
","Casablanca is nothing short of a masterpiece. Breathtaking at times. A must for every serious film-addict, even if it's not in your genre of choice. You're telling me that you can't spend 100minutes of your life on this little classic? That's lame.I'm not going to reveal the plot for you or tear the movies content down. I'm just going to leave you with this sentence:A must for the serious film-goer & a classic that will never be forgotten.",Null,1,1,8 April 2003
