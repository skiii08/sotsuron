Walk the Line," I Loved I Walk the Line
","Even when I was young, I was a Johnny Cash fan. Coming from an African American female who's favorite music is r and b, that's something. I absolutely loved the movie. I didn't realize Mr. Phoenix was signing his own lines until I saw him sing Folsom prison blues. he and Reese Witherspoon deserve Oscars. Bravo. I also liked the young men who played Elvis Presely and Gary Lee Lewis. They we marvelous. When Johnny Cash was going on a downward spiral and used drugs to combat hurt and win his father's respect I was very moved. My fiancÃ© and liked when he started wearing black and was asked was he going to a funeral, and he said 'Maybe I am.'",10,0,0,20 January 2006
