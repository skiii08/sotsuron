First Man," Drawn out and boring
","I love learning about space. I find it fascinating. I, unfortunately, didn't learn more than I already knew and this movie drags out all the scenes until they are painfully boring. I couldn't wait for this movie to end.",4,2,3,10 February 2019
Enchanted," Love finding other movie references
","I saw this when it first came out and it's still my favorite 'Disney Princess' movie. I love watching it and catching all the other Disney movie references throughout. Plus the songs are pretty catchy. I really like how well the animations match to the real life characters and even the concept of switching between the two is a great change from the classic Disney movies, which I also love.",10,1,1,3 September 2018
Shrek," Best Hidden Humor!
","I remember seeing this in the theater when I was in high school. My friend suggested we go, I was hesitant, but we were laughing throughout the entire movie! I love how many hidden jokes there are for adults to enjoy while watching with younger kids. I now watch this with my own kids and remember the fun we had watching it for the first time in the theaters all those years ago.",10,0,0,19 July 2018
