Vertigo," please rate the actual movie, not its historical value
","This is some weird movie..
I really do not understand why this is a top rated movie (besides the fact that it is very old)
This is very slow-paced, boring and the ending is horrible.
I really mean horrible. Ok it is surprising but it is not good.
The only thing I liked is the fact that it shows a San Francisco in the old times, the beautiful clothes people used to wear. A lost elegance.",6,2,5,25 November 2019
Knives Out," Awful
","You take a perfectly good cast and you waste them. The real protagonist was an evil nurse who did everything to mislead the police in order to cover for he incompetence. And eventhough in the end it appears that she was not responsible, she was. Because she stood by as the old man took his life.
She took the fortune for herself instead of giving it back.",3,4,12,10 February 2020
Oldboy," Very bad movie
","I really do not understand why this movie made it to the top 250. I found it pervert and too hard to watch. I did not like it at all. Incest, violence. It was a very dark and upsetting movie. I saw it 7 years ago so I do not remember the whole thing but I remember how bad the movie was. I did not like the plot, the filming, the actors. Please someone explain me why this movie is thought to be a top one. Plus I saw in my DVD club a movie called Oldboy but with American actors. Did they actually make a remake of this? I totally not recommend. Plus that Korean actor acted as if he was a real sociopath. I do not know whether I should admire this kind of dedication to a role or be afraid.",1,8,17,25 August 2014
The Hateful Eight," What an epic fail
","I usually like Tarantino's movies. Not all of them. But still I like them because they are fast and interesting. usually. This movie was almost 3 hours long. 3 hours of my life lost, watching this horrible movie. Let us begin. The movie was advertised to bring a new movie experience. But the whole movie is either in the snow or at Minnie's haberdashery. I don't even know what that means. So, you are not going to watch something with at least decent cinematography. The plot is really simple. Really simple. There is no plot actually. People want to save the woman who is about to be hanged. It doesn;t go according to plan. End of story. The only thing Tarantino promised and he accomplished, was creating truly hateful characters. Can I make a break and say that I NEVER NEVER EVER LIKED SAMUEL JACKSON??? I feel that he destroys every movie he is on. He is hateful in any movie he played actually. And the whole thing with the colonel's son was outrageous. Why did Tarantino make such an upsetting scene? No reason to. Anyway, there are 2 actors I actually like in this movie. Kurt Russel ( who doesn't like Kurt Russel?) and Tim Roth. Kurt Russel played in Deathproof . Tim Roth and Michael Marsden were in Reservoir dogs. We can also see Zoe Bell who is most of Tarantino's films. But this movie was stupid. It has nothing to do with reservoir dogs or any other of his movies. But I honestly believe that Tarantino is indeed clever. I believe he intended to make a movie as horrible as this one. It is slow and unwatchable. Still the ratings are good. Why? Because it is a Tarantino movie. A movie he came close to stop shooting it even if he thought of it years ago. So that makes me thinking that the destroyed his own movie on purpose. For me the experience was wtf did I just watch? For those who haven't seen it yet , you are about to watch a dull, boring movie, about people you don't even care what will happen to them because they are hateful.You just hate them. You don't care. And they will all die, the most stupid way possible.",1,2,3,12 July 2017
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," 10/10
","Excellent movie.
It delivers unstoppable action for 2 hours.
If you like action movies then you will be thrilled with this one.",10,1,2,25 July 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," The movie is mediocre
","I will have to say that I have watched all Harry Potter movies but I haven't read any book in order to make the comparison. Same case here. I have no idea about the book,if the movie depicted the book well or not. My judgement is based totally on what I have seen. The movie was ok but just that. Nothing special.It had one or two interesting plot twists but the movie was very slow. The special effects were ok,nothing extremely great. The plot was very simple and slow.
I mean they could add so many more things. it was plain and simple",6,0,0,25 January 2019
Inside Out," Not bad but not as good as people say
","I watched this film due to the fact that it is rated very high so I had great expectations.Those expectations were not met.
The film is slow.Very slow. It has some good moments but it is not thrilling.
Joy tries to prevent sadness from creating sad core memories and therefore they are lost in Riley's memory.They try to go back and fix this before she loses her joy and personality. But it is somewhat ridiculous.
This quest is not interesting. I got very bored watching this.And I like animation, it's just that this one fails.
The idea is interesting but it is not well executed. I do not think that this movie was made for kids, it is more of an adult movie. It is not funny at all. It is depressing. It also makes no sense. Why Riley's parents sold their beautiful house and bought this horrendous house in San Francisco? And why didn't they try to clean their house.The house was awful.It is not a place for a kid to live. And all these weird stuff. Imaginary friends,broccoli pizza, scary clowns. The script is plain and absurd.
I feel that lately animation films are totally drained out of interest and plot. It is not as bad as 'wonderpark' and 'ralph breaks the internet'.Those films were horrendous. But this one is dull and miserable. Joy wants to bring joy but she is more depressed than sadness.",6,2,3,23 April 2019
How to Train Your Dragon 2," I did not like it
","The reason I put 3 stars at first place it is because it had nice graphics. Other than that the movie was terrible. Spoiler alert!! Hiccup's mother left them and never came back because she was looking after dragons?? Stupid His father and mother find each other after so many years and they want to start over (WHY? she abandoned them) anw and then he dies?? He dies because of toothless who was under mind control? Sad The good alpha dragon just died?? Toothless and Hiccups remain best friends even after toothless killed Hiccups' dad? All these do not make sense The movie had no plot It was terrible Plus the person who makes Hiccups' voice has a deeply annoying voice. It is not a cartoon movie for kids. It is very dark. And the first one was dark but this one is worse. I think it should be a pg13 movie. The feeling after watching the film was sadness and disappointment. I like cartoons, I liked the first one too. But this it was a big failure",3,4,9,14 February 2017
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," excellent
","It has been almost 20 years since I have watched it. I was 17 at the time,without any particular taste in films and there was a small cinema in the small city of Ioannina in Greece where I was on vacation. I need to add to this point that by that time I had watched many many films regarding kung-fu, mostly old movies with Lee and Chan and these movies were the reason I started practicing martial arts from a young age. So I went to the cinema hoping to watch another Kung Fu movie. Oh boy, I was wrong. This movie is a masterpiece. I have watched it several times ever since. It is so special. It is not about Kung Fu. It is about love,loyalty, living for a higher purpose. I need to say that I only enjoy this movie in Chinese. In English it is not that great to watch because it looks fake.
So take your time and enjoy this great film.",10,3,4,4 April 2019
Aladdin," pretty good but..
","This film is really good, even though I have watched aladdin many times since I was a kid, this film was really nice to watch. Because it was not 100% the same and it kept you wondering about the ending.
Guy Richie is my favourite director and even though this totally different from his other movies,he nailed it. The colours,the scenery were amazing.
What I did not like is the feministic views that appear so strongly in this movie.
In the cartoon Jasmine did not want to become a sultan. In this movie she wants to be a sultan so bad that it is ridiculous.
I liked will smith as jinnie ,he was really good at his role.
I did not like tha casting for Jaffar, because he never looked as scary as jaffar was. Jaffar is a super villain,they should cast someone who gives you the chills.",8,4,8,8 August 2019
The Lion King," I was disappointed
","If I compare this movie to the original movie (1994) which is my favourite movie, this movie is 1 or 2 stars MAXIMUM.
However if I try to see it as a movie on its own without any comparisons it is an honest 6.
If I put the two movies side by side this one is terrible. Its lack of emotion is evident and it can not be covered up by the good CGI (good not excellent, I think they could do much better). The plot is there, it is good but good is not enough. The scenes I liked was 1) mufasa rescuing simba and nala from the hyenas and 2) timon and pumpa were delightful in all scenes. I found them funny.
BUT the most important scene of the movie( mufasa's death) was uninspired and emotionless. I always cry when I watch that scene, I was not even feeling emotional.
Scar was not well animated because at the scene where Scar was fighting Simba I could not tell who is who.They should at least try making him more recognizable(or Simba). Also many meaningless scenes from the original were really prolonged (the mouse at the beginning and when Rafiki realizes Simba is alive when hair from his mane travel to his tree). They were not that important scenes. But Mufasa's death on the other hand was fast.
I watched this movie 25 years ago (boy time flies fast..) and I was 10 at the time. I was blown away. And I still am blown away when I watch the original masterpiece. If I try to imagine myself being 10 years old again and having watched this movie as if it is the first time..I honestly believe that I would not feel the same.But I would not rate is a rubbish either. If this stood alone it could be 6 or more.
Btw the songs were not good either. Lion King's soundtrack is impeccable. No one can deny how beautiful it is. It can not be compared to these songs.
You know.. I would try to watch this movie with my niece who has not seen it yet in order to tell me her opinion. I am really curious. Do kids like this movie?or is it meh. For me it is average",6,0,0,11 October 2019
Logan," what a horrible ending to Wolverine character
","This movie is terrible. Awful. Hideous. I mean who likes to see a young girl decapitating people? This was even worse than wolverine 2. 
It was the worst possible ending to wolverine and professor X.
I am not going to lie, I don't know those character endings based on the comics they rely on. But even if they did die this way, films have the freedom to depict whatever they like.
You don't have to kill wolverine. You can always recast him.
Wolverine is a legend, as well as Superman and Batman. 
Any the movie was sad. A monstrous girl , created by Logan's unique blood sample. And Logan becames very old, he is dying actually and all he does , he takes care of professor X who has ceisures that endager all people around him.
BUT WOLVERINE does not have to grow old. He is an immortal. He has lived through centuries without a scratch. And suddenly he is so weak.. 
And his hideous daughter. What a freakish hellish child. So marvel wants to reaplace Wolverine with that abomination?
I am so sad they ruined the whole wolverine idea..",2,4,11,26 July 2018
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," beautiful movie
","I should have watched it earlier.
This movie is a gem. It is so unique it doesn't fit into any category.
It deals with something most people have struggled to deal with.
The pain that comes from the memories of a relationship that has ended.
What if someone magically (or with the use of advanced technology) could wipe out all the memories associated with a person? Good or bad it doesn't matter because you have to let go of everything attached to the person you once loved.
And what if these people meet again? will they form a connection again?
Will they feel something?
The movie is one of a kind, it is well-worth of your time.
It is simple,not pretentious, beautiful",10,0,0,16 July 2019
Les Misérables," it was terrible
","I must admit it. I could not watch the whole movie. I left the theater much earlier. So many good actors, such many potentials. And yet, spoiled by the continuous ( I mean really unstoppable singing) They could have made a musical (even though I really dislike musicals), containing some songs , but not this. Every line was sung!!!! Every line!!! I could not even watch anymore. I tried to stay, to make my ticket money count, but I could not anymore. All the actors were singing, watching the camera face to face. Everything was so terrible. Except the costumes. I would not suggest this movie to anyone. I can't probably understand HOW this thing made it to the top movies.",1,2,6,12 December 2014
Joker," Joaquin Phoenix deserves the Oscar
","I am not a fan of Batman movies (though I have watched them all) and I really hated the Dark Knight movie. And the reason I hated it was the reason everyone loved it. It was Heath Ledger. His acting was the epitomy of abnoxious. It was sooo annoying to watch him. But then he died and everyone praised his acting even more.
I am not a fan of Joker either. When I saw this movie's trailer I was like Oh my here we go again. Another annoying movie.
I was not supposed to watch it. But after all the success and the reviews I decided to watch it, not in order to enjoy it but in order to see what everyone was talking about and have my own opinion.
I was shocked because instead of watching a mehh movie I watched a masterpiece.
I really do not understand why many governments banned this movie for people under 18 (it is not scary or gory) and I do not understand why people expected mass shootings or things like that.
This is JUST A MOVIE. Not scarier than other movies I have watched. It is a movie about people with mental illnesses and about people who are neglected by their country and authorities.
But what makes this movie really worth watching is Joaquin Phoenix. I like him as an actor but I never thought he was THAT good. He is excellent.",10,3,5,12 November 2019
Bram Stoker's Dracula," It could be a masterpiece but..
","When the fim was released I was around 10 years old.That is why I did not watch it. And I remember at that time special effects in movies weren't great but they were not THAT bad either. I remember the knight rider, back rogers etc and they did have superior effects.
Anyway I just saw the movie.And it is faulty. But I don't judge it very harsh because it has a 'poetic' feeling.
I really liked Gary Oldman , nice style. Keanu Reeves had a terrible British accent. I mean terrible.Winona Ryder spoke as if she was sobbing.
But the story was interesting and decent.
I wish it was better executed.
This movie was not scary at all but it was upsetting. The moment dracula hands the baby to the female vampires or when Lucy holds a child on her way to the tomb. Also some serious plot holes.
Mina seems enchanted by Vlad, she goes out with him, she lets him hold her and kiss her etc and then when the telegraph comes from the fiance she does not really care about, she goes (alone) in Romania to marry him. I mean it does not make sense how se even managed to get there. And why does Jonathan want to marry her so bad? Should not he be recovering from all the trauma he had been through?
At the end why Mina cuts his head off?I mean she embraced the fact that he was evil, she wanted to be with him and he is dying,she pushes the sword deeper to release him. Ok I get it, he was dying anyway, but why cut his head off? If he had any chance for a second chance it was gone..
When mina attacks Van helsing and the other 3 vampire ladies come, van helsing performs a small exorcism and the we see them attacking horses or something,next scene they are lying next to each other and Van Helsing cuts their heads off. When did all these happen?
The movie was absurd but all together it was interesting and memorable. I have watched movies and at the end I could not remember watching them. I don't think I will forget Gary Oldman as Dracula.",8,0,2,5 September 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," This is not the best film ever done
","I watched this movie around a decade after its release. Back then, internet was not everywhere and probably imdb did not exist.I remember the movie.I did not like it, but it was not terrible either. It is a movie about the framing of an innocent,it is about all the bad things he went through and finally comes redemption. That's it pretty much. Do not expect a classic movie. I was not moved by the movie,I was not excited ,I did not have anything to contemplate. It was a simple story. It is not bad, but please don't tell me that this is the best movie ever made. This is absurd. I have watched so many movies in my life and I have watched masterpieces. I cannot believe people said this was the greatest movie. Do not have so high expectations if you want to watch it. You will end up disappointed.",6,0,1,25 January 2019
The Woman in Black," So scary
","This movie was the end of me watching scary movies ever again. I scared the hell out of me.As a horror movie I can say it is brilliant because it is so scary. But I should have stopped watching it from the opening scene. I should not try out of curiosity to watch the whole thing. I do not know what happened in this case. I have watched quite a lot scary movies including movies like the Exorcist, Saw, Scream, the Ring, the Grudge, the Eye, etc etc. OK someone might tell that those are not so scary compared to others. BUT the woman in black shocked me. My boyfriend came to see me after I had just watched the movie (plus I watched it with low sound and my hand almost covering my eyes 'cos i could not watch it otherwise) and he found me shaking out of fear. I told him I had watched a really scary movie, he insisted on us re watching it together in order for me to overcome that irrational fear but i could not. The next day he watched it alone out of curiosity and he said he was not scared at all. I do not know what to say. I say so many movies with exorcisms, ghosts, vampires, serial killers etc but this one marked the end of me watching any kind of creepy staff again. I do not know how to explain the fear I felt for the very first moment",7,2,4,25 August 2014
Creed II," It is at least better than Creed 1
","Viktor Drago is a nice person. He grew up without his mother ,without money but he is disciplined and he is not cocky at all. BUT the problem is that he should be the star of the movie because in addition to his good qualities , he is also a much better boxer than Creed. In the first fight,he destroys him, Creed is down and out of the blue, Victor lands an unnecessary punch which gets him disqualified. Why would they rip off this victory from him? I mean he could at least become a champion because he deserves it and then they could ask for a rematch. But he was deprived of the chance of becoming a champion and this is a mistake.
Ivan and Viktor Drago deserve to make a comeback. Drago did not kill Creed on purpose in Rocky 4. It was Creed's choice to continue the fight even if he was badly hurt and Rocky's choice not to stop the fight even if he could,because Creed did not want to give up. What kind of logic is this? In Rocky 4 I rooted for Drago because Creed chose to die than accepting the fact that he was outmatched by his opponent. Sometimes you have to know when to give up. Drago was a very solid character in the two movies he appeared and at that time it was Cold War time so in USA they had all these movies with the bad Russians (and they still make these movies, unbelievably in every action movie there is a bad Russian). I feel that the movie was biased against the 'bad Russians' who actually were the only ones who deserved the title",5,4,7,15 February 2019
Jojo Rabbit," THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
","This movie is not only a masterpiece ,it is also very original.
So different from everything I have watched, and I have watched thousands of movies.
Most movies are unoriginal. This is so great.
A war allegory, the enemies in our minds and the thought of being a good patriot not allowing you to see clearly.
I cried a lot in this movie.
I did not expect it to be so captivating.
Scarlett Johansson proves her self to be a great actress, away from those idiotic blockbuster movies.
The little boy's acting performance was intense.",10,13,25,11 February 2020
Lucy," Not a good film
","As a film, it begun interesting After a while it was a total mess And after the middle it was impossible to watch. First of all , it is based on a theory that people use only the 10% of their brains and if the proportion of use changes, many other things will happen. But, it becomes a total mess. Lucy experiences god-like powers, she is arrogant, evil, not a persona that someone would like. It becomes so messy, she travels through space and time and the movie shows fireworks and stars all the time. At the end, the unthinkable happens. Lucy turns into a bio computer and hands over the knowledge in a USB stick. It was a terrible ending. Besides Lucy's character (which is awful), there is no other character. The actors have an undeveloped personality. It is like no one else exists in the film. The film actually shows Scarlett Johansson behaving like a psychopath. And the whole theory that brain development will lead to this result? No one will buy it. It was not even a pleasant film. So many good action or sci fi films. I would never watch it again and definitely I am not interested in a possible sequel. Boring",2,1,6,6 April 2015
Deadpool," this is zero stars
","I have to say that this movie is one of the worse out there. It is zero stars for me. I am a fan of xmen and the marvel universe.I have seen all the movies, so I decided to watch this one based on the 8 star review from the IMDb. The reason I was avoiding it is because I really did not like the character as it was presented in wolverine origins ( a film I really enjoyed watching). The character should remain dead because he was awful. Not only they did not leave him there dead, they decided to make a movie about him.This movie is supposed to be special because he is an 'anti- hero'. Who cares? Of course the movie is special because it is absolutely garbage. No one should watch it. I can not even explain how awful it is. How on earth this movie got 8 stars? I think the reviews are paid reviews. It does not make any sense. I could not watch it until the end because it was hard for me. Please don't watch it.",1,4,13,22 June 2017
Annihilation," What a horrible and boring movie
","I had high expectations from this movie. 
But it was horrible.
So boring, so silly. The actors seemed bored too. There was no emotion in this movie. I had a difficulty watching it because it was so idiotic. 
For example, they go to this place to get answers , they walk into the terittory, things don't go well. They can not even remember the first days they were there but they do not even try to get the hell out of there. The go to that deserted base, they see the people dead from something like a fungus and they do not even attempt to go to other places. The characters are boring as hell. They die and you don't even care about that because you can not feel empathy or sympathy for them. The idea of it could be interesting but it was not well executed. It is like watching a sad documentary. At the end of the movie you do not get answers. If the alien entity ceased to exist just because it fullfilled its purpose by just taking over 2 humans, why didn't it do that earlier? For 3 years it was there. It could take over some scientists who went there, then disappear and let them go out of that place. It makes no logic staying there and killing all its potential carriers. Anyway, nothing made sense. The movie was boring. The special effects were not good at all. There was not even one moment when I cared of what was going to happen. I do not understand why the movie is rated so high.",1,1,2,23 August 2018
Spectre," I wanted to like it but..
","James Bond movies defy logic in many cases (The hero is undead, the hero can take a plane down with his bare hands, the evil guy even if he has James Bond at a gunpoint, chooses to give him a way out) .This is typical James Bond but it is also enjoyable. This movie defies logic at a whole new level.
It has no actual plot, it has no soul. Daniel Craig looks tired of the James' Bond character, but I guess he could have let someone more eager to take the part instead of destroying the movie looking misearable.
And Cristoph Waltz. What a waste of such a great actor.. He showed up in the movie I guess for less than 10 minutes. And the reason his became evil??? Are you kidding me?? He became evil because his dad adopted an orphan boy?
This was the evil character's backround? That a spoiled Austrian brat got jealous that his father adopted another son?
But I should have known from the beginning,when James Bond recklessly hijacked an helicopter and put so many lives at risk. And for what? Because a dead woman told him to. And she also told him to attend the funeral?Why? Because she knew that as a sex maniac he is he would have sex with Monica Belucci and therefore find out where the criminal organization meets?
And Dave Bautista? He killed someone because he wanted his place at the table ,nobody hurts him for this disrespect,and then instead of enjoying his place at the organization,he embarks on a journey to hunt James Bond?
What a really unreasonable movie. Nevertheless ,it was fun to watch,that is why I still give 6 stars instead of 1 or 2.",6,0,2,22 July 2019
