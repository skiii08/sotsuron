Catch Me If You Can," Good viewing, but mostly tame ...
","LdC wasn't too bad in this movie. Great having a face that can either be 16, or 29, depending upon the scene/era.  I was at a bit of a loss though ... when Hanks went to France, it was in December 1967, however, he and Leonardo were on the plane home in December 1969. Did Hanks stay in France for two years, or was that a bad continuity call?  Lastly, in 1961, Tony Curtis did a similar job to LdC in 'The Great Impoostor'. At least in that movie, he was good at what he did, no matter whether it was as a doctor, or a prison shrink! LdC's role seemed to more of a case of 'I wanna be a doctor, even though I'm totally clueless!'6/10",Null,0,1,14 January 2003
