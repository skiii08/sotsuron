Who Framed Roger Rabbit," crazy and fun
","it was an awesome movie. Bob Hoskins performed well, his reactions to the toons were in my opinion the best, he also did well on his American accent. This doesn't matter to me but just in case you want to know it isn't quite as innocent as a looney toon. If you get the DVD its quite a fun menu. Roger Rabbit is what a toon is supposed to be , funny and insane. My favorite character was Eddie Valiant. probably the most insane parts of the movie were characters acting serious when in a comical situation but don't mind me, I like crazy. The moral of the movie is its better to have a sense of humor I think that's true. It's twisty yet it can be predicted. So if this comment was useful let me know.",7,0,0,11 May 2007
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," one of my best
","This is among my favorites, it's thee greatest film of James Cameron. It's better than the first and third but if you have never seen any terminator movies, you should watch the first. This movie won special effects of 1991 but it deserves more. Arnolds acting has improved from the first. You should get the extreme DVD, it is extended with extra scenes that are quite important (in my opinion). This movie is also the most lightened up of the three (mostly due to john Connor's sense of humor). Like all terminator movies, the bad guy has more advantages. This movie has a little bit slower pace than the other two, it is also the longest, 1 hour 59 minutes regular and about 2 1/2 hours extended.",8,2,2,14 May 2007
Pulp Fiction," like a graphic novel
","this was a great movie in my opinion it is similar to the movie sin city as crime/noir as the main genre and being set up like a graphic novel, this movie is in a graphic novel format because it is divided into chapters, the first scene they show the definition of pulp 1 of those meanings is a magazine or book containing lurid material its better to like story almost or as well as action which i do so i like this movie. Quenton Tarintino did an excellent job directing. This movie isn't great for kids but if you believe your child can handle it go ahead. also similar to sin city due to multiple story lines making a story. This movie has well developed characters (i.e a heroine addicted mafia enforcer, a boxer who isn't afraid to kill, a mafia enforcer who recites a bible passage). A difference from your average movie. 1 time where the critics are right.",10,0,2,2 May 2007
