Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worst sci fi since Plan 9 from Outer Space
","Let me just start off by saying, SHAME ON YOU GEORGE LUCAS!  How could you take such a wonderful franchise, the STAR WARS saga, and create such a horrific atrocity?  How dare you violate your fans like this?EPISODE 1 is by far the most vile and retarded science fiction movie I have ever seen.  This movie proved a very strange theory for us all, and that is, that there is no limit to how much money and technology you can expend on a single movie and yet create an end product that is worse than even the lowest budget attempts.  EPISODE 1 assaulted every sense of taste and decency that an average person would have.The plot of the movie is paper thin and yet over-written.  It basically revolves around this SITH lord who using the Trade Federation to exploit some people who live on a peaceful planet.  Some Jedis come along to negotiate peace and the Sith takes the opportunity to try to assasinate them.  Along the way they encounter what must be the most ludicrous and annoying character in cinematic history, Jar Jar Binks, who is a poorly done computer generated monstrosity that attempts to provide comic reliefe for the movie.  His jokes are not funny and most of his lines, including his accent, are racially offensive.  He clearly speaks with a Jamaican accent and refers to the two WHITE Jedis as 'his massa.'  He is not the only character in this pile of garbage to be racially offensive, the evil 'fish people' of the trade federation deliver their ametuerish lines in an Asian accent.  Anyway, the two Jedis come across an INCREDIBLY annoying little boy named Anakin and blah, blah, blah, blah.  Are you bored reading my review yet?  You should thank me!  This is actually better than the movie!
The movie is so poorly written it defies description.  It is on par with your average television Soap Opera.  The lines are banal at best, offensive at their worst, and generally just boring.  The special effects are supposed to be top-of-the-line, ground-breaking, but they are actually just cartoonish.  The over-all look of the movie is what I would call 'Anime gone bad.'Let me point out one aspect of the film that actually bothered me more than any of the other attrocities.  The action-oriented conflict of the movie revolves around one loan bad guy named Darth Maul who is chasing down the Jedis, Obi-Wan and Qui Gon.  He chases them through part of the movie and this sets up the big final fight scene, the show down between them, climaxing in an over-the-top light sabre duel to the death.  One quick criticism:  When did the Jedis start learning Kung Fu?  I guess the Jedi counsel must have gotten a copy of THE MATRIX at some point.  The light sabre fights in the first three movies were much more exciting.  The problem with the light sabre duel in Episode 1, however, is not so much in the choreography, but the premise of the fight itself.  Why is Darth Maul so emphatically chasing the Jedis?  Simply because his master told him to. That is a major lack in character motivation. Why does he attack them both at the same time?  This OBVIOUSLY puts him at a disadvantage.  And this is the real problem.  The end fight is Qui Gon and Obi Wan teaming up against Darth Maul.  This makes Darth Maul the UNDERDOG in the movie!  And audiences always root for the underdog!  So this totally deflates the excitement right from the start.  Not to mention, its pretty stupid of Darth Maul to do this, and it is also not very sinister.  If he was really on 'the dark side' of the force, would he not wait and attack his prey when they are at a real disadvantage?  Wouldn't that at least be smarter?  And it would make the audience hate him more.  Instead, the audience is not given any such motive on which to base their dislike for Darth Maul.  But hey, he wears black, so I guess he must be evil!  That is LAME!  An audience needs character development in order to really get in to the movie.  Darth Maul is not developed AT ALL!  His story amounts to a scene where his master tells him to go kill the Jedis, and then he attacks the Jedis who escape, and then finally he fights them at the end, and that's it.  This was VERY POORLY DONE!What I believe happened is, George Lucas simply got too big for his own good.  He had too much power and not enough motivation to try harder. When he first made STAR WARS A NEW HOPE, he was really a struggling film maker. He was FORCED to re-work his script, time and time again, making it better and better.  Experimenting with what works and does not work.  The pressure was on to prove himself.  But these days, what does he have to prove?  He is litterally the wealthiest man in Hollywood.  Why waste his time STRIVING for perfection?  What difference did it make to him what the end product of the film amounted to?  It made no difference.  And in fact, the film totally sucked, and yet made a ton of money world wide.  Why?  Simply because he exploited the devoted fans like myself.  This go around, we are the ones who suffered for Lucas' mistakes, not him.  And now, he has gone on to make the next installment, EPISODE 2, which no doubt be just as bad if not WORSE than EPISODE 1.  I would not normally think that a movie could actually be BELOW the low point that EPISODE 1 sank to, but George shocked me and taught me a lesson:  if there is a new low point, he will find it.  And so it seems, EPISODE 2 will in fact exceed 1 in SUCK-i-tude.  Its almost as if he is trying to make the movie worse, he isn't even bothering to shoot it on FILM! And after viewing the trailer for the new movie, it is OBVIOUS that it was shot on Hi Def Video.  Which, by the way, make no mistake, LOOKS LIKE VIDEO! Again, this is substandard to the tradition set forth by the earlier Star Wars films.Shame on you George Lucas!  You should have backed off from this project like you did with Empire Strikes Back.  Irvin Kershner should have been brought in to bail out the new Star Wars projects.  And on that note, is it any real surprize that Empire was the BEST of all the Star Wars movies? Hmmm, could it have anything to do with the fact that George Lucas had almost nothing to do with that film?  George, you need to take note:  NO ONE liked HOWARD THE DUCK.  Therefore, that kind of film making is a TOTAL WASTE!  Jar Jar Binks would not even appeal to a small child, and he did nothing but insult the intelligence of the rest of the audience.Also, the chariot race in Episode 1 was really a low point of the movie. For one thing, it was TOTALLY ripped off from an ANIME movie, so it was not even original.  And isn't it strange that the 'Pod Racer' video game was released WAY before the movie?  Clearly, that entire scene was put in the movie as nothing more than a marketing ploy so that George Lucas could get even welthier from the sales of that stupid video game.  I would be willing to forgive such a blatant selling out if that scene had actually been worth watching, but as it turned out, it was just as boring as the rest of the movie!And finally, a note to other Star Wars fans:  If you are defending EPISODE 1, you are KIDDING YOURSELF.  We ALL know that movie SUCKED really bad. Now, I say this to you, DO NOT GO SEE ANY MORE STAR WARS MOVIES!  The Star Wars fans should REFUSE to go see EPISODE 2.  I am not going to see it, and I won't even rent it. This is the ONLY way to send a clear message to George Lucas that we will not just sit back and take his crappy attempts.
Avoid Episode 1 at ALL COSTS!!!  I am voting this movie a 1, which means AWFUL on the IMDB.  I wish I could vote in the NEGATIVE INTEGERS!",1,33,64,20 February 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Worst Star Wars Movie
","After reading what the other users have said in their comments, there is little left for me to add.  However, I wanted to emphasize that as a true Star Wars fan, this movie was nothing more than insulting.  I hated it from start to finish.  George Lucas dropped the ball with this one, that's for sure.  I wont waste time telling you how incredibly stupid Jar Jar Binks was.  He was the worst of all the idiotic characters depicted in the film and everybody already knows that.  This movie was not done in the same way that Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back were done.  No, this was more in the style of George Lucas' other atrocity, HOWARD THE DUCK.  There was NO character development, the plot was non-existent, and the light saber fights were over done, too flashy, boring, and completely under motivated.I admit, I will stand in line like a moron to see the next movie.  And George Lucas will get richer because of my stupidity.  But lets just hope that maybe, JUST MAYBE, he actually learned something from the fiasco that was THE PHANTOM MENACE.  I am not asking for much, maybe just a coherent story line, and maybe gear the movie towards people that have an IQ greater than that of an average 1st grader.THE PHANTOM MENACE SUCKED!  Bottom line.",1,1,3,11 January 2001
Underworld," Disappointing and Boring
","Two of my favorite genres are action and horror, and considering UNDERWORLD was werewolves vs. vampires, I did not expect to be falling asleep in the theatre!  I could hardly keep my eyes open!  This movie was a big disappointment for me.  The previews made it look action packed.  But in reality, the movie was overlong and only had a couple of action sequences. Don't go to this movie expecting to see MATRIX type action or something like BLADE.  BLADE and THE MATRIX are millions of times better than UNDERWORLD and UNDERWORLD is not even in the same class.It's a real shame, because I think UNDERWORLD had a lot of potential.  I am sure most people who saw the movie would agree with me.
The movie was shot well.  The production design was great and the overall look of the film was fantastic.  But the script fell short.  There was a lack of tension in the movie.  The audience does not really care for any of the characters.  The 'love' story between Selene and Michael was non-existent.  They fall in love with eachother after only meeting for a few seconds.  And, in that time, Selene constantly has a gun in Michael's face. Ridiculous.  Also, there is no RISING ACTION in the movie.  The writers failed to RAISE THE STAKES.  That is a basic element of good screen writing, and it is absent in this movie.  And for the most part, none of the characters are developed.  There are two characters in particular that really annoyed me.  First, Kraven was terrible.  I will be amazed if the actor who played Kraven EVER works in a real film again.  Through out the entire movie, he is trying to act 'intense' and 'angry.' But he just constantly breathes heavily through his nose!  He didn't convince me at all!  The other character that really bugged was that black guy who was the werewolf with the SUPER deep voice. That was just silly.  Obviously, they are trying to test him out as another counterpart to Vin Diesel.  Vin has a low voice, but the joker in UNDERWORLD sounds like a cartoon character.  He was trying to be all serious and everytime he opened his mouth I was laughing out loud!  You really have to hear this guy's voice to appreciate how stupid it sounds.  You can't hardly even understand him.  But believe me, it isn't worth sitting through the entire movie just to hear this stupid guy's voice.  Just take my word for it, it is silly. The movie is technically done pretty well.  It is definitely a case of atmosphere over substance.  I really wanted to like this movie, I really expected to be thrilled by this movie, but instead I was just bored.  I will go watch BLADE 1 and 2 again.  But in closing, I must comment on Kate Beckinsale and how she is incredibly HOT!  She is very hot.  And even though the movie was boring, at least I got to look at her most of the time.  She looks better when she is not all gothed up.",3,0,1,22 September 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Everything a Pirate movie should have
","This was a great pirate movie.  It has been a long time since a high budget pirate movie has come out.  The last attempt was the dismal 'CUTTHROAT ISLAND.'  And where that movie failed, POTC succeeds. 
POTC has everything that a pirate movie should have.  Plenty of swashbuckling action, of course.  Lots of beautiful sailing ships.  Huge pirate vs. Navy battles with side guns blazing and swords flashing. Mysterious islands with hidden treasures.  And of course, a great sword fight showdown on top of a mountain of burried treasure. 
Of course, the highlight and the twist to this movie is that some of the pirates are somewhat ghosts, suffering from a curse.  The special effects team at ILM has once again impressed me.  The effects are amazing.  As the pirates move around, passing in and out of the moonlight, they transition so smoothly back and forth from ghostly skeleton to flesh.  It is seemless and very realistic.  There are an amazing amount of special effects shots in this movie that must have taken hours of pains taking work.  The special effects are definitely worth seeing, and they do not skimp. 
More importantly, perhaps, is the story of POTC.  The story is very well written, and the key characters of the script have very clearly defined motivations.  Captain Sparrow wants his ship back and to take revenge on the mutaneers.  The pirates want the curse lifted, and need the blood of one of their own.  Elizabeth wants to be with the blacksmith she has loved since childhood.  And he wants to be with her.  Naturally the pirates kidnap Elizabeth and the blacksmith is off to rescue her no matter what, and to discover his own origins.  All of these needs and wants are presented clearly and quickly in the movie, and backed up with a lot of great action. This makes the movie a lot of fun to watch.The leading lady, Elizabeth, is incredibly hot.  They did a great job casting her, because she is a lot of fun to look at.  But that brings me to my only complaint about the movie.  She seems to be the only really hot girl in the whole movie.  I think it could have used a few more hot girls.  But then, I always think that.  There is a lot of great stunt work, with a lot of great rigging.  But the stunts are not so over the top that they become distracting, which was the case in both 'CHARLIE'S ANGELS' movies.  POTC takes you back to stunts in the style of an Indiana Jones film.  On top of a great story, great writing, great casting, great locations, and great action, this movie is also funny.  There were many moments that the entire audience was laughing out loud.  Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.  You will have a good time.Definitely worth the price of admission.",8,0,1,14 July 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," HORRIBLE!
","This movie bored me to death! Don't waste your time seeing this horrible, boring piece of crap! The majority of the movie is people standing around acting scared about the weather report! They go ON AND ON for over an HOUR, just people TALKING about the weather changing! It was INCREDIBLY BORING. Nothing exciting happens in this movie at all. It is a total waste. I hated it, and I wish I had my money back. Everyone in the theatre was GROANING as the horrible lines were delivered on the screen. Every cliché was used. The effects were very CGI in characteristic. The movie was just plain boring and stupid. The main subplot was about Dennis Quaid HIKING to New York, because his son was trapped there. That was VERY STUPID! What could Dennis Quaid POSSIBLE do to improve the circumstances once he arrived!Walk with the people some more? This movie was just stupid and boring. DON'T waste your money or your time. Not to mention, this movie had a STRONG ANTI American theme and message. I REALLY hated that. But really, it is nothing to worry about, since no one will even see this stupid movie because it was so BORING! Anyone who might watch this movie is going to be BORED to death. I saw most of the people in the theater FALL ASLEEP! On the IMDb the lowest rating is a 1, and that is what I voted on this movie. I wish I could have voted LOWER! This movie SUCKED!",1,4,8,2 June 2004
Cloverfield," Great monster movie
","Cloverfield is a good monster movie. That is what it is, and that is all it is. I loved the 'monster movie' music over the end titles. That was great. Really good track. Obviously, this movie was done in the 'Blair Witch' style, but with awesome 3D effects. I will mention that at the end of the movie, as the credits began to roll, the audience was definitely disappointed. But that does not reflect my assessment of the movie. I liked it, and it was strange for me to hear the groans of the other patrons. They seemed really angry. So I will say that if you are not a fan of the genre, or if you don't 'get' what the movie is trying to do, then you will not like it.But the movie is genuinely entertaining. It has a particularly scary part inside the subway tunnel with the night vision feature of the hand held camcorder. It reminded me of the terrifying sequence in a subway tunnel in '28 Weeks Later.' I loved it, and I felt that the director did a great job with suspense and action.The movie is scary, it has great effects, good acting, and a good story line. I think that most people are not going to appreciate the thrill ride like I did. I recommend the movie, but I recommend going into it with an open mind.",7,1,5,19 January 2008
We Were Soldiers," Not as good as I expected
","ICON productions has had a couple of great movies.  Namely, BRAVEHEART and PAYBACK were both fantastic movies that I watch over and over again.  But 'WE WERE SOLDIERS' does not live up to the previous titles. 
The movie was talked up to be extremely graphic with explicit images of war violence.  And, in fact, it was pretty graphic.  But after seeing SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN, this movie was mild by comparison.  Also, I did not find myself caring about any of the characters as much as I did the characters in RYAN and BLACK HAWK.  The movie does not seem to flow very well.  The first act of the movie is very long and teeters on the edge of boredom.  It mostly follows the 400 soldiers that would be the first to encounter the North Vietnamese army as they prepare and train.  The audience learns about the characters and the beautiful wives and adoring children they will inevitably leave behind.  By the way, the woman that plays Chris Klein's wife is SUPER HOT!  If I had a woman like that, there is no power on earth that would pry me away from her. Not the Viet Nam War or anything else.  Anyway, that first act dragged on a little too long.  Also, the characters are presented as just a little too saint-like.  Half way through I was thinking, 'Is Mel Gibson a soldier or a preacher?'  The movie practically beats you over the head with a cross as you watch.  I kept expecting to see Mel Gibson walking on water. By the way, combat helmets have chin straps for a reason.  Why do the soldiers in this movie only wear their chin straps while they are in formation on a parade field, when not much is really happening?  But then, when all hell breaks loose on the battle field, nobody puts their chin straps on.  I thought that was distracting.   Now for my biggest problem with this movie.  CAUTION!  SPOILER ALERT!OK, fair warning.  The wives wait back at home to hear word of their husbands.  The telegrams informing them of the dead are delivered by the ominous yellow cab.  So, when the yellow cab shows up, the wives all freak out and the audience is nervous to find out who has now died.  Each time that yellow cab shows up, somebody else has died.  And we are worried about Mel Gibson's wife and family, of course.  Then, at the end of the movie, the yellow cab makes one last stop...at Mel Gibson's house where his wife and kids are waiting.  The door bell rings, and the wife looks out the window. There is that awful yellow cab.  She can hardly open the door, and emotionally orders the children to bed.  Then, bravely opens the door...and surprise!  Its Mel Gibson!  He survived!  And felt that it was necessary to RING THE DOORBELL TO HIS OWN HOUSE!  WHERE HIS FAMILY LIVED!  Maybe it was just a little JOKE he was playing on his EMOTIONALLY DISTRAUGHT WIFE!!!??? A cruel little joke.  I am sure his character was thinking, 'Haha, it will be hilarious to trick my wife in to thinking I have been horribly killed in battle!  Then, SURPRISE!'  No, I don't think that was what his character had in mind.  I think the director of the movie took a CHEAP SHOT at the AUDIENCE!  And this was a low point for the movie, to be sure.  No one in my family ever rings the doorbell when they are coming home, they just WALK IN because THAT IS WHERE WE ALL LIVE.  I don't ring the doorbell to my own HOUSE!I don't want to be disrespectful to this movie or to the cause of the Viet Nam War, or to the men who died there.  My father fought hard in Viet Nam, and saw a lot of action.  As I grew up, he spared no detail in telling me about the various horrors he witnessed.  And because of this, I have a better understanding of what Viet Nam was about and therefore I have a higher standard by which I judge movies dealing with the subject.  In my opinion, I have never seen a movie about Viet Nam that depicted the events accurately.  No, not even PLATOON was accurate.  When directors make movies about the Viet Nam war and they glorify or romanticize the events, then they do an injustice to heroes who fought there.  WE WERE SOLDIERS tries to do justice to the events, but it falls short somewhere.  However, it is not without a certain element of entertainment.  And I really enjoyed Sam Niel's character.  He was great as an old war dog, bitter and strong. 
Unfortunately, I have to rate this movie fairly low for the reasons listed above.",5,0,0,3 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," PAIN!...SUFFERING!
","Carrying on in the DISMAL tradition of PHANTOM MENACE, the sad and tired fans of STAR WARS are forced to sit through another special effects nightmare cooked up by the old has-been, George Lucas.
I will mention the plot outline now, but does it really make a difference what this movie is about?  How much time do you think George spent cooking up this snooze-a-loney and cheese sandwhich of a story?  OK, someone is trying to kill Senator Padme (Natalie Portman is extremely hot!) and the trusty Jedi, Obi Wan and his apprentice, Anakin, are sent to protect her and figure out who is out to kill her.  The Republic is dangerously close to collapse and on the verge of a major war with the trade federation.  Are my readers asleep yet?  Well, go see the movie, that will put you to sleep quick enough.That's the basis of the plot, and yes, it sucked.  There is a couple instances in the film that remind us of the STAR WARS of the old days. But they are few and far between, and not nearly as exciting as the originals.
Which brings me to a couple of good points, and I will mention them first, before RIPPING THIS FILM TO SHREDS.  Ewan McGregor is the only one who does any real acting in this film.  His character of Obi Wan is flawless and he brings excitement to the screen.  The best part of the movie is when Obi Wan ventures alone to the rain planet and confronts Jango Fett.  (Yes, its Boba's father.  I guess EVERY character in the original movies has to be taking after their FATHERS in these new movies!)  On the water planet, a giant clone army is being created.  All of them, clones of the fearsome bounty hunter, Jango Fett.  This part of the movie gives us insight in to Jango's past and possible future, and it was well done.  It builds up to a decent fight scene between Jango and Obi Wan, where both characters get to show their stuff.  The special effects of the weirdo alien hosts are well done, and the sets appear to be sprawling and well conceived, in a very 'sci fi' style.That's it.  That's all the good stuff.  Now, to take my gloves off.  THIS MOVIE SUCKED!  The ACTING was THE WORST I have EVER seen in a movie theatre, and I saw 'UNIVERSAL SOLDIER' with Jean Claude Van Damm and Dolf Lundgren. OK? I mean, the acting was ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!  TO the point of being both irritating and laughable.  The worst actor, of course, being Hayden Christiansen.  Where did this guy go to acting school?  The SEWER?  And Samuel Jackson delivers THE WORST performance of his entire CAREER!
But, in the defense of the actors, they had VERY LITTLE to work with.  A good example of a typical, cliche line is Anakin wooing Padme, 'I don't like the sand.  It's coarse, and irritating, and it gets everywhere.  Not like you.  You are soft and smooth.'  OH BROTHER!  PLEASE somebody make him SHUT UP!  But no, he KEEPS ON!  And the worst portion of acting is when Anakin returns from trying to rescue his mother, and he has a little emotional breakdown in front of Padme.  'It's no fair!'  He whines, 'Obi Wan is holding me back! I hate the sand people!  I hate them!'  Most of the people in the audience where turning their heads from embarassment for the poor actor.Now on to Yoda.  The special effects team did not manage to pull off his fight scene believably.  My head line to this review is a comical quote from one of Yoda's many, many irritating dialogue sequences.  He is 'sensing' some disturbance in the force, and he QUOTES an old STAR TREK line. 'Pain!...Suffering!'  He exclaims.  Remember that STAR TREK episode when Kirk and Spok went in to that cave and confronted that creature made of rock?  And then Spok 'mind-melded' with the creature and he yells to Kirk, 'Pain...SUFFERING!'  I laughed out loud when I heard Yoda repeating that horrible line.All of the fight scenes in this movie are lack-luster.  But, its difficult for an audience member to be excited by a fight scene when you don't care AT ALL about any of the characters on screen.  I think the big problem was that the story failed to give a clear sense of what was at stake.  In the original movies, you knew exactly what was at stake.  The underdog, Luke, had to blow up the Death Star, or else they would blow up the entire planet that the rebel alliance was on.  That's pretty clear.  Also, they had to save the princess.  How clear is that?  Very clear.  So it was easier to care about these characters.  Not to mention, there was a lot of character growth in the original movies.  EPISODE 2 has no character growth whatsoever.Also I noticed that George failed to include some STAR WARS classics.  No one said, 'Delusions of grandure.'  There was no swinging on ropes.  When he finally did work in, 'I have a bad feeling about this' it was EXTREMELY forced!  VERY awkward!Also, watch out for C3Po's TERRIBLE jokes.  He gets his head knocked off, so he says, 'Oh, I have lost my head!'  His head rolls over by his body, he says, 'I am simply beside myself!'  WHO is writing THAT CRAP!!?!? A five year old?  What kind of moron writes a line that is THAT obvious?  In all of Hollywood, George Lucas could not a find a writer to help him come up with something more clever than THAT?!  I have to tell you , I was absolutely SHOCKED to hear lines that were so banal.  Even DISNEY features have better writing than that.So why is it selling so many tickets?  Why all the hype?  Why is everyone so excited?  Well, the fact is, EPISODE 2 is actually better than EPISODE 1. So everyone is excited.  But what does that really say?  If you said, 'Well, its better than PLAN 9 FROM OUTERSPACE' what would that really mean?  PLAN 9 was considered the WORST movie ever made!  EPISODE 1 was SO AWFUL how could any other movie be worse than that?  The fact is, if the name STAR WARS was not attached to this movie, no one would see it.  In fact, no one in their right mind would finance a script so ill-conceived.  So the movie would never have even been made.And just to let you know, yes, Jar Jar is in this movie.  Obviously, George Lucas listened to the millions of people who so vehemently hated that horrible character.  So, Jar Jar's appearance is quite limited.  But, he still remains INCREDIBLY irritating and HARD to watch!  Jar Jar is, by far, the WORST character ever conceived.Jar Jar is also a good metaphor for what has become of the STAR WARS sage. It is over done, poorly written, very obnoxious, and it would not exist without extensive computer special effects over-kill.",1,0,1,26 May 2002
Watchmen," Super Hero, Super Soap Opera, Super Boring!
","Why make a movie about super heroes that are retired? This movie completely sucked. It was so totally boring. I was shocked, I was mad, and I had to fight to stay awake! There was actually a guy in the theater that fell asleep and SNORED through the entire movie. It was really funny, people kept trying to wake him up and tell him he was snoring. He would awake, apologize, and then 5 minutes later he was snoring again! And I was thinking, 'Who can blame him!' His time was better spent asleep because I am sure his dreams were more entertaining than this stupid movie! The movie is THREE HOURS long and is made up mostly of dialog. It is also FILLED with flashbacks that we see over, and over, AND OVER again. The movie would have been HALF as long if they would have only shown each scene ONE time.I am a huge fan of super hero movies, I loved the Christian Bale BATMAN movies, I loved IRON MAN, I loved BLADE, but this movie just bored the crap out of me. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! Just skip it, save yourself three hours. This movie was horrible.",1,81,169,7 March 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Worst movie since THE PHANTOM MENACE
","I have never seen so much fanatacism by fans over a movie that was so boring!  The people who are reviewing this movie are talking as if they have had a religeous experience.  Visually, the movie is well done, which is to be expected considering it was directed by Peter Jackson, who is a genius. The movie is acted well, the sets are good, the costumes are good, all the elements essential for a good movie are there, except one...a decent story line!  The story line for this movie reads as follows:  'Let's get the ring from point A to point B.'  THE END!  And it didn't even accomplish THAT!  At the end of the movie, the entire theatre full of people around me were saying out loud, 'What the hell was that?  That's it?  What a rip off!' Here is a note to the studio execs who pushed this project through:  if you are going to have an audience sit through three hours of dribble, there better be some kind of pay off at the end!  The biggest problem with this film is that it does not follow the standard structure for a good movie, which is First Act:  Set up, Second Act:  the main characters are in peril and all might be lost, Third Act:  Resolution.  This movie had none of that, it was all pretty much First Act.  And I understand all these die hard fans keep saying, 'But that is how the first book went.'  Well, TOO BAD!  This is not a BOOK!  And I know this is a trilogy and the first movie is the first act, but EACH movie should be able to stand on its own.  Just like the original Star Wars trilogy did.  Each movie was a complete film and stood on its own, each with its own first, second, and third act. 
Another problem with LOTR, the action was very boring.  The action was boring because there was no set up.  It was simply a group of UNDEVELOPED characters walking around and encountering obstacles, passing over the obstacles, and moving on...THE END!  A perfect example is when they encounter that giant octopus thing.  That came out of nowhere.  We, the audience, did not know that an octopus was lurking around.  Just suddenly out of nowhere, it attacks them, and easily enough, Strider runs over and hacks it away and all is better.  Now, on to the next obstacle.  Oh, an entire army of Orcs?  No problem, Strider hacks them away.   On to the next obstacle.  Another giant army of swarming bad guys?  No problem, Strider...go get 'em.  BORING!  BORING!  BORING!  Who the hell is Strider, anyway?  The geeks would probably say, 'Oh, you have to read the book.'  No, I do not.  I SAW the movie!  If his character was not developed in the movie, then that is a short coming of the MOVIE!  This was a big problem with LOTR, no character development.  I think overall Peter Jackson was trying to do the best he could with a script adapted from an overlong fantasy book written in the 30's.  I think the movie could have been a lot shorter and a lot more straight forward.  A big problem with the film was that the ring never changed hands.  Of course, this goes back to the lack of a second act.  If there had been a second act at all, the ring would have ended up in the hands of the bad guys, and all doom would be about to take over, and then just in a nick of time, out of courage and cleverness, our little  hero Frodo somehow saves the day with an act of self sacrifice, and hurls the ring in to the cracks of doom or whatever.  This would have been much more interesting, much more exciting, and a lot less time consuming.  Another thing:  the Hobits were SO ANNOYING!  They were nothing but wimps! And the 'hero,' Frodo, had no heroic qualities at all and didn't even seem to be attached to the mission.  Everybody he encountered, he tried to give the ring up to them.  The elf queen, Gandalf, just whoever wanted it he quickly offered it to them.  And he was of very little use in the movie, he was always running and hiding.  This film failed to make me care about any of the characters.  And what about when that human (006 from Golden Eye) dies at the end?  Has there ever been a longer on screen death?  I was in my seat going, 'Come on already!  DIE!  GET IT OVER WITH!  OK, you're dead! LET'S GO!'  He was dribbling on and on and dying on screen for like 15 minutes!  And that bad guy that killed him, the really big, ugly Orc, the audience was supposed to hate him.  But we didn't have enough time to hate him!  The character was introduced and then quickly dispatched....BY STRIDER!  Wow, don't mess with Strider, he will kill anybody.  I guess he is invincible like SUPERMAN!  Again, BORING!  If they wanted us to hate and or fear that big ugly Orc, they should have introduced him early on, and had him kill somebody close to Strider, and then have him pursuing our heros through the film, and at the end of the film, he and Strider fight again, this time to settle the score.  Now that would have been exciting.  That would have given some structure to the movie and given the audience something to anticipate towards the end.  The basic rules of movie making were thrown out the window by this film, and that is why it suffers.  I will not go see the next two installments.  So at least I learned my lesson, even though it cost me three very painful hours of my life.  If you are looking for something boring that doesn't challenge you at all, then this film is for you.  If you like good movies that are exciting, AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS!  This movie DOES NOT belong in the IMDB Top 250 list, and it is an INSULT to movie fans around the world to have this film listed as NUMBER 1.  It doesn't rank as number 1, it has way too many problems to even be on the list, and I hope more sensible people will rate this film and knock it down to where it belongs.  I rate this film a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10.",1,2,9,3 January 2002
21," Avoid this one, don't believe the hype
","This movie was exactly what I thought it would be. A boring plot, no interesting characters, and 'paint-by-numbers' direction. Mainly this movie just lacked a compelling plot. It was just BORING. I figured it would boring, but I saw it anyway just because nothing else was playing at the time.Aside from being totally boring, there was one particular error that really bothered me. The characters throughout the movie are visiting a variety of casinos in Las Vegas. All kinds of different casinos on the strip, and some of the casinos that are nowhere near the strip, such as the Red Rock Casino. However, no matter where they go, Lawernce Fishburn's character is watching them, and happens to be at the casino they are in no matter when they are there. How did he magically transport himself around the entire Las Vegas valley like that? It was really obvious that the movie makers did not take this into consideration. They just expect you to believe the Fishburns character is inside every casino at all times.Another thing that bothered me about this movie was the geographic setting of the casinos. I live in Vegas, so I know that the Hard Rock casino is NOT located on the strip, as it was depicted in the movie.Anyway, this movie sucked, I hated it, and I wish I had not wasted my time seeing it. So, take my advice, and go see a different movie. Hopefully one that has a decent plot.",1,13,20,11 April 2008
Pitch Black," Best Sci Fi movie since THE MATRIX
","Finally a sci fi movie done RIGHT!  This movie is basically the old sci fi formula famous in many other science fiction movies...space travelers crash land on a strange alien planet, and soon are stocked by deadly aliens, and must struggle for survival and to find a way off the planet.  The story has been done before, but never as good.  Vin Diesel's character of Riddick is ground breaking.  My favorite movie heroes are always the 'Bad' good guys...as bad as a good guy can get, and still be a good guy.This movie is brave.  The script is original, the execution of the movie is phenomenal.  I loved this movie!  And I am sure you will too.I have to comment on this movie's ending.  Don't worry, no spoilers here. But the end was brave.  It will surprize you.  You think you know who is going to survive and who is going to die, but you will be surprized.I actually spoke to Vin Diesel himself at a chance meeting at the Hard Rock Casino here in Vegas and he told me the sequel to this great movie is in the works, and it will be called 'THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK.'  I will be first in line to see it!",10,1,1,5 January 2001
Resident Evil," Great Zombie movie
","This is a fast paced, high-tech, high-action, horror film that keeps you entertained from beginning to end.  There have been other attempts at bringing video games to the big screen that had miserable results.  Of course, we all remember the ill-fated Mario Brothers movie.  MORTAL KOMBAT was probably the biggest let down.  TOMB RAIDER was not as bad, but still failed to really 'wow' audiences.  So far, I would say RESIDENT EVIL is the best video-game-gone-big-screen so far.  The plot outline is pretty simple:  A team of commandos venture in to a secret corporate research base to discover what went wrong and why all the employees were killed off.  They find out that horrible experiments were taking place and a biological terror is released in the form of vicious, flesh-eating zombies.  They have to find the antidote and get out before they are sealed inside forever.  The film moves fast.  There are a lot of scares, some of which are set up with fast editing, but the film pulls it off effectively.  The gore abounds and is VERY well done.  Some of the disfigurements of the zombies was done with CGI to great effect.  There is one zombie that is missing a large portion of his head, which pretty much looks like swiss cheese, and that effect is both startling and grotesque.  I loved!  And if Zombies are not enough for you, there are also zombie dobermans.  And if that doesn't give you nightmares, there is a big, Frankenstien/Alien-from-hell monster that breaks loose from its incubation chamber that probably will give you nightmares. Besides the great effects, there are a lot of cool scenes throughout the movie.  The highlight of which is probably the part where the commandos are sliced up with a laser beam.  Also, the gore effects here are fantastic. (The end of the guy's knife getting sliced off and falling on the floor was a nice touch!)  In fact, this movie is a lot gorier than I anticipated it would be.  It is much more gore-infested than most movies that have been coming out in recent years.  So that is a breath of fresh air to a horror fan like me.  In some ways, the movie amounts to a very well done 'B' horror flick.  If you are like me, you will love that kind of stuff.  Although this is not a perfect movie, the second act is long and well developed.  By this I refer to the characters getting further and further in to trouble.  The situation gets worse, and then, just when you think the situation could not get any worse, it gets WORSE still!  Which creates some good suspense and great action scenes which build up to a fantastic third act with an exciting final battle on the train.  Without giving anything away, I will just say that the conclusion was really well done.  I really liked the ending, not only because it was creepy and the final special effect was really grandiose, but because we get to see Milla Jovovich's muffin...who could ask for anything better?  She certainly doesn't seem to have a problem getting naked, which is a good thing.  Made me reminisce of the good old horror movies of the early 80's.  Only two minor complaints.  The part where Milla starts breaking everybody's neck, I didn't really buy that.  The human neck doesn't break so easily. Although, dying with Milla's thighs wrapped around my neck sounds like a pretty nice way to go.  And sometimes the characters get in to deep trouble and then the movie doesn't really explain how they got out of that trouble. This doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film, however. 
If you liked ALIENS and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (my all time favorite horror/zombie movie) then you will like RESIDENT EVIL.  Don't make the mistake of thinking this is another bummer of a video game/movie.  It is an effective horror movie all on it's own.",7,0,0,17 March 2002
No Country for Old Men," Good action movie with a terrible ending
","I will skip the plot synopsis, since I figure you already know what this movie is about if you are reading my review. I want to speak directly about the ending. So if you haven't seen the movie, don't read on because there will be spoilers. *****SPOILER ALERT******I was really enjoying this movie right up until the ending. The movie centered on the conflict between two great characters: a seriously ruthless, relentless bad guy and a very likable 'everyman', who was a clever underdog played by Josh Brolin. It was really great watching Brolin's underdog clashing with the terrifying hit-man, and the whole time you are rooting for Brolin to win because you like him so much and you hate the villain so bad. Then, a little more than half way through the movie, the two characters become set to face off against each other. I was thinking, 'Wow, this is going to be awesome. We are going to see one hell of a showdown.' The two characters who have been chasing each other through the whole movie finally have a voice to voice phone conversation and they promise to kill each other. But what you expect to happen is actually the opposite of what happens in the movie. The good guy does not win and ride off into the sunset with the girl. Instead, the bad guy wins and kills EVERYBODY! And he gets away with it! At the very end, Tommy Lee Jones gives some kind of rambling monologue about a dream he had regarding his father. I am sure it was meant to have some kind of a summary importance to the movie, but it seemed pretty vague to me. If anything, I got the feeling that the movie was trying to send a message, and I believe that 'movie messages' should be implied, not imposed. Bottom line, I don't like bad guys winning! I hate having a good guy character that I identify with get killed by a bad guy that I hate. That is a flaw that I cannot forgive in this movie. I rated this movie a 4. I would have rated it lower but I really liked the action and the characters in the first part. They had a lot of tense moments and a lot of good gun fights. That was definitely worth seeing. But the ending absolutely ruined it for me. I know other IMDb users are going to say that the Coen brothers were trying to be unconventional, artistic, and they were trying to stay true to the book of the same name, etc. But I don't care about that. I care about GOOD MOVIES! And I am disappointed that this movie took such dumb turn at the end. It could have been and SHOULD have been much better.",4,1,3,5 January 2008
District 9," Good, but fatally flawed plot
","SPOILER ALERT! I am going to talk a little about the plot, so I am warning you that I might give something away in my review. Great movie, a lot of fun to watch, good action, good special effects. HOWEVER! Why did the aliens trade all their super cool, super powerful weapons for cat food? RIDICULOUS! The story shows the prawns being very quick to attack or harm humans. They are quick to be violent, and they clearly don't like being treated so badly. They are characterized by being involved in all kinds of sleazy behavior and crime, so why in the world would they willingly disarm themselves? They had to wait all that time until Wikus comes along and finally starts using their weapons against the humans to realize that they should be using the weapons? All that time they had been willingly disarming themselves, trading their weapons over for CAT FOOD? SERIOUSLY? That just did not make any sense to me at all. The movie is a lot of fun, lots of action, lots of gore, great special effects, good tension, good characters...but the whole time I was watching the movie I was asking myself, 'Why did the aliens trade their weapons for cat food!' That made no sense. So I felt that was a fatal flaw in the plot. I just couldn't get past such an obvious flaw in story logic. I am surprised that the movie makers didn't ask themselves that while making the film.",5,0,6,22 August 2009
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Good, but not great
","This film is getting a lot more attention than I ever thought it would.  I am amazed that a film of this genre has been so well received here in America.  As a fan of Hong Kong cinema, I am glad to see such films getting more attention here.  However, this movie is getting more attention than it deserves. First of all, the flying warrior genre is not new.  It has been done many, many times before.  Personally, I have never cared for wire-assist stunts. Really, THE MATRIX is the film that has broken the ground for films like CROUCHING TIGER to get acceptance.  But in THE MATRIX, the wire assist stuff was minimal.  CROUCHING TIGER has people flying all over the place.  The big problem I have with the flying warrior genre is the effect never really looks right.  The people are sort of running through the air, and their feet don't ever seem to hit at the right time when they are supposed to be jumping off stuff.  I just find it irritating!Next, CROUCHING TIGER is not a lot different from IRON MONKEY.  Same basic concept.  Same basic plot, and yes, IRON MONKEY was ridiculous.  The big difference, and saving grace, is the big epic love story in the middle of the movie.  I am a huge fan of action movies, but really, the best part of this movie was the love story in the middle.  The fight scenes were OK, but they have been done MUCH better.  Not to mention, the fight scenes were largely unmotivated, and I hate that.  Also, some of the fight scenes did not have enough light and it was difficult to see what was going on.  I suspect this was due to the fact they had to use stand-ins extensively because Chow Yun Fat is no martial artist.  The acting was good, the love story was good, but overall the movie was long and the plot was typically over-complicated.  I don't know why its getting all the attention that it is, but I think it is just a case of right place/right time.  I hope we see more martial arts movies in the future where the stars are real athletes and do not require the assistance of wires!",5,0,0,18 February 2001
A Quiet Place," Slow, boring, and full of plot holes
","Don't believe the hype on this movie. This is an example of extremely lazy script writing. I'm kind of shocked that so many people are saying this movie was great. I saw Chris Pratt on Instagram raving about this movie and urging his followers to go see it. As I sat in the theater, I was so distracted by the constant glaring plot holes that I found the movie extremely frustrating and boring. If you are paying attention to the movie as you watch it, you will find it impossible to take serious. SPOILERS AHEAD! 
The monsters key on sound, right? But we learn about halfway through the movie that there is a nearby waterfall, the sound of which is sufficient to mask the sounds that the monsters would normally key on. Uh, so, why not just move the family right next to the waterfall (where is also where they fish for food) and just camp out there? Pretty stupid. OK, next, the dad has the farm rigged with tons of lights. Just, lights strung up all over the fields. Where does he get the electricity for all those lights? Not to mention his little technology lab down in the basement. No generator? Is there a generator? If there is, how does he keep it fueled and how does he keep it from making noise? The monsters can be easily fooled with a kitchen timer, right? So, seems to me that it would be pretty easy to set traps for these things. Or, at the very least, how about rigging up noise makers? You know, you could power them with the apparently endless electricity they have? I could go on and on, but lets talk about the nail scene. I found this particularly frustrating. The nail is nailed DOWN in to the step, but the HEAD of the nail gets caught on Emily Blunt's laundry bag, and gets pulled up. The makes sense. But then, suddenly, the SHARP end of the nail is pointing UP. That makes no sense. Nails are not pounded UP in to the steps. The head of the nail would be up, which would probably hurt if you stepped on it in your bare feet, but it would penetrate. That nail scenario made absolutely no sense whatsoever. These and many other glaring plot holes made this movie impossible to enjoy. Perhaps the biggest problem of course is the very essence of the title: they are in a world where it is essential to make no noise, so, despite having two healthy children to look after, they decide to have a baby. Pretty much the only things babies do is poop and make noise. So their plan is to put it in a sound proof box? For how long? The next 4 years of it's miserable life? That's their plan???This movie was just stupid. I hated it. It is nothing but bad, lazy writing with setups and scenarios that do not make sense and do not make sense. Save yourself from this movie. Don't believe the hype. Don't bother. Read my review and know that this movie sucks.",2,778,1317,13 April 2018
The Hurt Locker," Like watching paint dry
","This movie won the Academy Award for 'Best Picture of the Year?' Seriously? Are you kidding me? I think that tells a lot about the Academy Awards and how completely stupid, pointless, useless, and misleading they are.Watching this movie was like watching paint dry, but thinking that at any moment the paint could explode. But then, when it does explode, you don't really care.I have noticed that 'action' movies that are directed by women are usually not great. When I started out watching this movie, I had high hopes for it because I had heard good things about it, and of course it won an Academy Award (for whatever that is worth). And I thought it would be interesting to finally see a good action movie directed by a woman (Kathryn Bigalow). But instead it was a total let down. Maybe Kathryn Bigalow should get a job making movies for the Lifetime Network, and stay the hell out of the action genre because 'HURT LOCKER' sucked.Watching 'The Hurt Locker' made me feel like I was INSIDE a Hurt Locker! And all I wanted to do was get out of that locker and go do something else. Every time the movie built up any suspense or tension, Bigalow manages to slow down the pace and kill the scene. Also, there a lot of times when you think the movie is going to take a new direction, and really get into a decent subplot, but then it just simply goes NOWHERE.Don't believe the hype on this movie. Stay out of the Hurt Locker, save yourself two hours of life. Somebody should put an explosive on this movie and blow it up. Funny, a movie about a bomb squad that is, itself, a total bomb. How ironic.",1,56,87,4 April 2010
Event Horizon," Great Sci-Fi/Horror Combination!
","Event Horizon is a great movie, and a masterful combination of science fiction and horror.  This movie has it all, great special effects, excellent actors, fantastic set design, good story line.  When I heard about this movie I knew the movie makers tried to basically create a 'haunted space ship.'  So I had my doubts.  But when I saw the movie I was very impressed. They definitely succeeded!  The Event Horizon is scary, but very convincing as an actual space vehicle.  I liked the originality of this film.  A lot of people were turned off by the premise of a genuine horror movie.  I think people went to the movie expecting to see some kind of alien incarnation, and when they didn't see that, they felt short changed.  But to me, this is a strong point.  The whole idea of a blood thirsty alien stowing away onboard a space ship and eating the crew one by one, has been done a million times.  So I really felt like this movie successfully broke new ground.  Its very original and very scary.  However there were some bad points in the movie, too.  The part where the character of Justin floats out in to space was not very realistic.  He actually exits the air lock without a space suit on, and is exposed to the icy vacuum of space...but he survives!  Impossible.  Scientifically speaking, his lungs would have been instantly collapsed and the nitrogen in his blood would fizz up, like a can of soda that has been shaken too much and suddenly opened.  The next part of the movie that is really weak is the part where Cooper gets blown out in to space and then 'surfs' back to the Event Horizon by blowing his air tanks.  If you have seen John Carpenter's 'DARK STAR' this part will remind you of the end of 'DARK STAR' when the astronaught surfs in to the planet's atmosphere.Other than those two weak points, EVENT HORIZON is a very good movie.  A scare fest full of originality and some refreshingly gory scenes.  If you are a fan of science fiction movies, you need to see this movie. The ships are great, the set design is fascinating, the ideas about space travel are new and even thought provoking, the scares keep you on the edge of your seat, and its really spooky.By the way, does anybody else see the similarities between Lawrence Fishburn's role in this movie and his role in THE MATRIX?",8,0,1,29 January 2001
Clash of the Titans," Awful, just plain awful
","This movie should have been called 'Clash of the Boring Idiots.' I am a huge fan of the original 1981 classic film, and I was excited to see a remake. I thought it looked like it was going to be amazing judging by the trailers that I watched. Wow, was I ever disappointed! This movie was terrible! The trailer was awesome, and it fooled me. I was hearing a lot of bad reviews before I went to see the movie, and I did not believe any of them. Again, the trailer looked so cool, I figured that reports of the actual film had to be erroneous. But the film just sucked.The special effects were great, but the story was just terrible! You would think the original story was so great, it would be hard to mess it up! But they did. There was no character development, and I found myself not caring at all about any of the characters. Characters seemed to just appear for no reason with no back story, and then disappear as quickly and easily as they had arrived with no wrap up or resolution. The story telling really felt rushed and underdeveloped. It was very boring.And officially, I am DONE with 3-D. I was not impressed. In fact, I was annoyed more than anything and I finally took my 3-D glasses off and tried to watch the movie in 2-D.The Boo Bo cameo fell absolutely flat. It did not make me laugh. I thought it was just pathetic.My recommendation: Go re-watch the original. Andromeda was way hotter, anyway (she is SUPER fine in the 1981 original, not to take away anything from Alexa Davalos). And even despite the old stop-motion special effects, aside from being a bit old fashioned, I think it holds up great and is a lot of fun to watch. Don't bother with this remake, it is a stinker.",1,10,15,24 April 2010
The Last Samurai," A long, boring let down
","***MILD SPOILERS*** I had such high hopes for this movie.  But, with my high hopes came cautious pessimism.  Of course I knew way ahead of time that Tom Cruise was the star of this movie, and he has proven time and time again that any movie that he so much as touches is ALWAYS ruined.  The same holds true for 'THE LAST SAMURAI.'  This movie was way too long, drawn out, and just plain boring.
The plot is not only thin, it is underdeveloped and vague.  Tom Cruise delivers a HORRIBLE job, filled with over acting.  Right from the start we see Cruise as a 'drunken, troubled military hero.'  His performance is absolutely embarassing to watch.  The rest of the movie leading up to the poorly motivated action sequences are filled with long shots of the characters looking at each other.  This is supposed to be the characters looking in disbelief or having a moment of epithany, but it is so over done it looks like the characters are about to KISS eachother!
I could go on and on about all the parts that are horribly wrong with this movie.  In particular (SPOILER ALERT) I will mention that Cruise is shot MULTIPLE TIMES with a .50 CALIBRE GATLIN GUN and he SURVIVES.  IMPOSSIBLE! Also, the flashbacks were SO amatuerish!  I couldn't believe it!  Zwick has been to film school, he should know better than to try to use flashbacks to develope his characters.  That kind of thing is better left to the real professionals.  What a doofus!The only decent scene in the movie is when Cruise is training his new troops and the superior officer comes down and declares them ready for battle. So this sparks the drama between Cruise and his superior officer.  Cruise argues that the men are not ready.  As the stakes are raised in the argument, Cruise places himself in front of the men and commands them to fire on him.  That was a good scene, it was well written with good conflict and good tension...TOO BAD THAT SOLDIER WASN'T A BETTER SHOT!  He would have killed off Cruise and saved the rest of my evening from being ruined!
In short, let me just say that if you want to see a REAL Samurai movie, go watch one of the many Akira Kurasowa classics.  If you have had the priveledge of viewing 'THE SEVEN SAMURAI,' then you know why I am slamming 'THE LAST SAMURAI.'  Akira had NO WHERE NEAR THE BUDGET when he made his classics, and yet they are all MORE exciting than this overblown pile of crap!  If you have not watched 'YOJIMBO,' or 'SANJURO,' or 'THE SEVEN SAMURAI,' or 'THE HIDDEN FORTRESS,' then you have no idea what a good Samurai movie is.  It is THAT simple.  If Akira Kurasowa had the emense displeasure of sitting through 'THE LAST SAMURAI,' he would just sit there and shake his head.  So much missed opportunity!  So much wasted effort! 'THE LAST SAMURAI' is SO BORING!  I hated it!That night, after I sat through the TORTUROUS 3 hours of 'THE LAST SAMURAI' I went home and watched 'SANJURO.'  That satisfied my longing for Samuraiaction.  Of course, my favorite Samurai movie is 'THE SEVEN SAMURAI,' and if you have not seen that movie, then you don't know anything about film.",1,17,42,9 December 2003
The Hurricane," Awful...should have been called 'SCOOBY DOO THE MOVIE'
","This movie was absolutely terrible.  It is a fictionalized account of some events that actually happened.  This movie in many ways is like the old Scooby Doo cartoons.  The 'medling kids' set out to solve a mystery.  After they gather some clues and start getting close to solving the mystery, the bad guy shows up wearing a beige trench coat and fedora (just like they always did in the cartoon) and warns them to back off.  Of course, they don't, so the bad guy sabotages their car (Mystery Machine) and as they are driving, the wheel falls off!  There are so many similarities to the old Scooby Doo cartoons that I find it very difficult to believe the director did not parody the cartoon on purpose.  Further more, most of the the movie is done via Denzel's narration, as his character recounts the story of Hurrican Carter's life.  This movie drags on and on and ON!  It is extremely boring.  I found myself interested in the movie when it first started, but soon I was seeing through the over-dramatic bull crap and I was repulsed. This is a terrible movie and should be avoided at all costs.  I gave this one a one out of 10 possible points, only because I cannot vote in negative integers.",1,21,39,19 March 2001
Jack Reacher," Not good
","Not a great movie. I had high hopes, I really liked Tom Cruise in MI: 4 Ghost Protocol. That was awesome. I guess I was hoping for more awesome Spy action. But this movie was a let down. It was almost good. But, as usual, Tom Cruise along with shoddy direction made this movie more irritating than entertaining. Tom Cruise is not a good choice for this role. Should have been somebody rough around the edges. Not pretty boy Tom Cruise playing a tough-as-nails Army investigator. I think Dwayne The Rock Johnson would have been better, or somebody like Arnold in his prime. That would be cool. But 5 foot 7 inch Tom Cruise as the ultimate tough guy? No. And the movie is really long. Something like a full two hours. Over long if you ask me. And the direction was slow paced. This felt more like a 1980's style made-for-TV movie than a block buster action flick. Now there are two good reasons to see the movie: Alexia Fast and Rosamund Pike. One word for two women: Hot! Especially that little hot number Alexia Fast. I want to see more movies with her in them. She looks amazing. Totally hot. And I have had a crush on Rosamund ever since I first saw her in Die Another Day. The movie could be a good action flick, but the direction is just too slow. The pace is slow. It plods along and fails to get any real momentum. And the whole plot seems a bit trivial. Some kind of hostile take over of a construction company or some stupid thing. Boring. Also, I have a message for Tom Cruise: Tom! Stop taking your shirt off! Tom has an awkward body and he is looking his age (50 years old!). He just looks out of shape and you can tell he is trying to hold in his gut and his man boobs are sagging almost as bad as Arnold's! It's just sad and ridiculous. Keep your shirt on, Tom!Now for a little complaint about the end. Waring! Spoiler Alert! Emerson holds Helen hostage, hiding behind her with a gun to her head and a gun pointed right at the door to the room they are in, in the dark, waiting for Reacher to enter. He is completely hidden behind Helen. Suddenly, Reacher jumps in the doorway and fires one perfect shot and kills Emerson immediately. Uh, yeah, right. I don't think so. That was lazy writing. The writers couldn't figure out a cool way for Reacher to save the girl so they copped out. That bothered me. In that scenario, Reacher would have certainly shot the girl and probably gotten shot himself. This movie is only so-so. Not bad, not great. If you want to see an awesome spy action flick, go see Sky Fall. If you have already seen Sky Fall, go see it again. It will be more fun than this movie. Looks like Jack Reacher was 'reaching' for a better film. Too bad he didn't have longer arms.",5,4,12,26 December 2012
Hancock," A thinly veiled Obama campaign ad
","I boycotted this movie when it first came out, despite the fact that I like Super Hero movies. I have always had this funny feeling about the movie, thinking it looked weak and stupid, and I had this suspicious feeling about it, too. So recently I finally decided to rent it and to my surprise, my suspicions were all confirmed. This movie was nothing but a thinly veiled Barak Obama campaign advertisement.It is about 'Hancock,' named after one of our founding fathers John Hancock. A MAGIC black man (super hero) who will 'Change everything.' The idea of Change comes up over and over again in the movie....if only 'people can learn to accept him and to like him. The whole world will change!' Hancock's friend in the movie is the character Ray, who is an image consultant. His day job before he meets Hancock is going around to EVIL CORPORATIONS run by WHITE MEN and trying to convince them to DO WHAT THEY DO, PRODUCE WHAT THEY PRODUCE, BUT GIVE IT ALL AWAY TO THE WORLD FOR FREE. Just like Obama's communist political agenda! I am not exaggerating, that is EXACTLY what he tells the corporations in multiple scenes. Also, get a load of this: the license plate of Ray's car is shown in one scene of the movie...it reads 'GREEN 44.' Any significance? How about the GREEN MOVEMENT and the 44th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? Let me tell you, I know movies, and in just about EVERY movie scene where a license plate can be seen, it has some kind of hidden meaning or code put in there by the director. That is one of the oldest and little known tricks in the book of movie making.Also, this movie was released on July 2, 2008 here in the U.S. Just in time to start brainwashing people and warming up their minds for the November Election. Don't forget that stupid staged photo of Obama posing in front of that Superman Statue. That picture was circulated heavily during his campaign, and it was not long after this movie came out. Seems obvious to me they were trying to tie it all together. I guess the people who vote here in the USA really are incredibly stupid. This movie sucked. It had no central villain, and the one armed bad guy they tried to put up against Hancock was weak and under developed. Overall, I rate this movie VERY low. It was a pathetic campaign ad, that's all. Don't bother with this piece of crap.",1,7,17,2 February 2009
Beowulf," The Grendel wants his neighbors to turn the music down!
","Great 3-D animation, good to see the first story ever written in the English language to graduate to such a high degree of technological incarnation. Some of the 3D computer shots actually looked like real pictures of real people. I definitely recommend the movie, and it was entertaining, but it did not follow the original story all that closely, which was a bit of a disappointment for me.Also, the first half of the movie seemed a little odd to me. It really seemed to me that the Grendel was like a person who had noisy neighbors. Ya know? Like, have you ever had neighbors who played loud music at all hours of the night? And all you wanted to do is sleep, but they are partying all night long and you can hear them, so they keep you up? And you just get to a point where you are so frustrated with them and you want them to just shut up, so you bust down their door and start biting all their heads off? That is pretty much how the first part of the movie plays out. And then, after the Grendel kicks everybody's ass and kills the party so he can finally get some peace and quiet, he leaves kind of like, 'Keep the music down or I will come back again and kill you all!' I've had neighbors like that, so I totally understood where the Grendel was coming from! But Beowulf is a great hero and it is good to see a good movie about one of history's greatest heroes.",6,0,7,19 November 2007
