The Blair Witch Project," It Worked as a Comedy...
","Whatever you do, do not see this movie!!! Do not add your dollars to the box office of this bad movie. It is not at all scary, that is unless you find a bundle of sticks or a pile of rocks scary. Now putting a woman in charge of directions, that's scary. I will say that, no joke, this works as a comedy. I was seriously laughing throughout the movie. I loved how the stoner dude kept saying man. If that was in the script it was great. If that was improv-ed credit goes to the actor. Then how these morons were afraid of piles of rocks and bundles of sticks? That was hilarious. And since these people apparently were the only film students to not see Scream, I would like to point out that anyone who has seen a 'horror' film should know never to run up or down stairs when you believe you may be in some danger. Whatever film school these three went to apparently neglected to show ANY HORROR MOVIE MADE IN THE LAST 25 YEARS!!! Go see Arlington Road; that was actually good.",2,1,3,7 August 1999
