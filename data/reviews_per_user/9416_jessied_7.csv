Catch Me If You Can," Interesting cat-and-mouse game
","***Possible Spoilers***Two mice fell into a bucket of cream.  The first mouse drowned.  The second mouse kicked its legs until it churned the cream into butter, and it crawled out and lived.  Director Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can tells the story of both types of mice in this cat-and-mouse detective drama based on the life of Frank William Abagnale, Jr.  The script contains major holes, but audience members forgive unexplained details because of screenwriter Jeff Nathanson's intricate and well-written script.  Every event and clue has a satisfying albeit predictable payoff, and the continuous scheming of Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio) keeps the viewer constantly wondering what will happen next.  Nathanson began with incredible material from Abagnale and Stan Redding's same titled novel, and he, Spielberg, and the cast turned this unbelievable history into an engaging film enhanced by a convincing and laudable performance by DiCaprio.Catch Me If You Can is told in retrospect to add to the outlandish nature of the situation.  Abagnale first appears as a scruffy but very young man-one with peers who rightfully act like teenagers with juvenile preoccupations. But by this time people have already called Abagnale a teacher, a doctor, a pilot, and a lawyer even though he never received any legitimate training in any of the professions.  He has traveled the world, intimately known numerous women, thrown fabulous parties, made wedding plans, hoarded large amounts of money, and figured out how to elude the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Abagnale has lived a lifetime-or more accurately stated, many lifetimes-and done so all before his twentieth birthday.Spielberg and Nathanson presented DiCaprio with an actor's dream.  Abagnale is a criminal, but he is a lovable criminal with good intentions and a desperate need to escape his loneliness.  The character's choices drive the plot, but his personality makes the movie.  DiCaprio delivers an awkward performance as the sixteen-year-old Frank, but one cannot criticize too quickly as the character must have struggled outside of his alter-ego existence.  Abagnale slips into the shoes of a twenty-eight-year-old physician with ease, but his own youthful sneakers never seem to fit. Abagnale's multiple roles require him to learn and imitate a variety of professions, but his disposition remains constant.  His charm woos the women, and his confidence and masterful use of language persuades even the greatest skeptic to believe his assertions.  DiCaprio's performance defines smoothness, and his choices illuminate the humanness of a man who chose a life of crime in order to escape a reality he could not accept.Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent duped for years by Abagnale's trail of bad checks and Christmas Eve phone calls.  His acting is only surprisingly adequate as the no-nonsense government agent, and is certainly not noteworthy.  The part does not demand much versatility, and Hanks' obvious reactions and other mediocre acting choices elicit little sympathy or interest in Hanratty's persona.  He is legitimately ultra-serious and focused on his career, but Hanks fails to create a sufficient amount of dimension in a character purposely written without a lot of apparent depth.The cat-and-mouse game and Abagnale's unusual situation provides over two hours of quality entertainment, but the many subplots and themes complete the film and make it memorable despite its minor flaws.  Jennifer Garner joins the cast to add more star-quality to the picture in a superfluous role, and Martin Sheen also appears with a bit part as a rich and influential attorney.  Christopher Walken completes the list of celebrities with an admirable performance as Frank William Abagnale, Sr., who teaches his son how to be the mouse that churns the butter and lives but who ultimately drowns in the cream.  Nathanson wrote a story about a long game of hide-and-seek for the screen, but he also wrote a story about complicated family dynamics, love and loneliness, and the complex relationship between a criminal and his lawful pursuer.",Null,0,0,28 December 2002
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," How to Lose an Audience in 10 Minutes
","Women repeat the phrase `How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' over and over again as if it's a brilliant concept in the film of the same name directed by Donald Petrie.  Screenwriters Kristen Buckley, Brian Regan, and Burr Steers' unimaginative choice for the title is indicative of their collective writing ability, but one exits the theater wishing they had more appropriately dubbed this comedic disaster `How to Lose an Audience in 10 Minutes.'  The story is expectedly built on clich√©s, not a criticism as it is inherent to the subject matter and a truth that applies to many films in this genre, but the writers rarely discover creative ways to turn hackneyed ideas into humorous situations.  The dialogue often lacks ingenuity, the scenarios are much too familiar, and the script is nearly void of an honesty that makes people want to believe in predictably trite romantic comedies.	Headlines that lure women to purchase fashion and beauty magazines fall off the covers and slide across the screen as morning activity ensues at Composure, the fastest growing women's magazine in the country.  Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) finishes a political masterpiece at her computer, and her colleague commends the article but reminds Anderson that she works for a publication that prefers articles about fitness, cosmetic surgery, and shoes.  The clientele just isn't interested in poverty, religion or the environment.  Poor Anderson.  Straight out of Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism with a column of her own and a schedule and salary that affords her plenty of free time both during the day and at night, a 5th Avenue apartment in Manhattan, and extra cash to spend on Knicks playoff tickets. Perhaps taking a more typical beginning journalism job covering the crime beat and town meeting after town meeting would have satisfied her desire to write about things that matter.  The staff meeting at Composure provides a bit of enjoyable light humor and a peek into an exaggerated display of new-age office tactics, but introducing Anderson in this context with her firm agenda in such a flimsy atmosphere is awkward and unbelievable.Single-life lover Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey), how cute--two A's for Andie and two B's for Ben, accepts a bet offered by his boss and associates at the advertising agency, which pairs him with Anderson.  The couple plunges into a romantic relationship, and both characters conceal their real objective after agreeing that all is fair in love and war.  The conversation that takes Anderson and Barry out of the bar and into the restaurant where they feast on lobster and get to know one another is the first glimpse of a witty and refreshing exchange; enjoy these fleeting moments as they are the exceptions rather than the rule.  Laughable moments do return, however, in full force during late-middle scenes in this nearly two hour film.  The first dinner date at Barry's apartment, the boys' night poker scene, and the couple's therapy session all rescue the drowning viewer from the depths of ennui.But even these rare moments cannot save How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. Nevertheless, the film does find some redemption in its two lead actors. Individually, Hudson and McConaughey add spark to dull words and circumstances.  Together they are dynamite, and one laments the fact that they were not endowed with a script that matches their talent.  Hopefully they will reunite at another time--after both actors prove themselves in other roles that better display their abilities.  In this film, though, both performances are expressive, intelligent, and warrant acclaim for adding something laudatory to a film that should have been canned and hidden away forever out of public sight or left on the cutting room floor.One does not learn anything from the `how to girl' in this film except that love ferns die just like relationships if they are not properly nurtured. Diamond companies do not pay advertising companies great sums of money to come up with a slogan like `Frost Yourself'; one can only hope this was a failed parody attempt.  Men do not come back carrying flowers and missing the smell of perfume on pillows to women who are prone to dating faux pas. No man should tolerate ten days of Andie's erratic behavior, and no woman should want a sports-fanatic boyfriend who skips game seven of his team's playoff series to go to a Celine Dion concert.  Andie is annoying but occasionally endearing and the gestures by Barry are valiant, but none if it is real.  Comedy doesn't need to be steeped in reality, but How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days suggests that something needs to resonate with the audience or all is truly lost.",3,1,2,6 February 2003
Capote," Capote. Man and Film--Imperfect but Captivating
","Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) lied to the people he pursued for stories that made him one of the most laudable American writers of the twentieth century. While the screenwriter (Dan Futterman), director (Bennett Miller), cast and crew of Capote deserve praise for an overall entertaining film, one must wonder if this creative team employed similar, manipulative tactics to please audiences and critics alike. The film does not tell the story of the Kansan family brutally murdered by Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) on November 15, 1959; famed writer and director Richard Brooks accomplished that task in 1967 with Capote's In Cold Blood starring Robert Blake as Smith and Scott Wilson as Hickock. Instead, it tells the story of its namesake who suffered through a self-imposed mission to return the convicted murderers to the realm of humanity. The story is captivating, but it is also rife with details altered from Capote's original account. Hollywood conventions effectively trivialize the life of the author and his work and diminish the credibility of the film and its creators.Audience members should not limit filmmakers to original texts. Entertainment value typically trumps dedication to an original narrative if the alteration does not interfere with the story's integrity, but one must scrutinize artistic liberties utilized in films that aim to inform as well as entertain. Creative teams should not substitute sentimental falsities for mundane realities. Choices that substantially differ from the reality of a situation must be made with great care and caution. The filmmaker must remember that he or she rewrites history for the masses with each detail that he or she changes, and that these changes cannot be justified simply for dramatic effect. A lack of thoughtfulness cheapens the richness of life that exists outside of the movie projector and disrespects those who lived and died with experiences suitable for the silver screen. One who attempts to capture absolute truth on film will usually fail, but this failure exceeds any attempt that procures cinematic greatness at the expense of humankind.Capote does not necessarily mislead its audiences or distort the author's memory of events that served as the basis of the novel that followed Breakfast at Tiffany's and became the last work Capote would complete before his death in 1984. All noticeable changes relate to details concerning the Clutter family if Capote's account is to be believed: names of minor but significant characters have been changed, characters' stories have been combined for cinematic efficiency, a sappy last line appears in Nancy's last diary entry, Perry kills all four family members, and the author rather than Sheriff Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) receives the murderer's tearful confession. Filmmakers cannot be limited to reality, but they risk losing their audiences' trust with every artistic variation. Name changes and the compilation of characters might have been unavoidable and necessary for practical and legal purposes. Hollywoodisms such as the diary line, a furious rage in which one killer storms through the house killing four helpless victims even though both men pulled the trigger twice, and a tearful confession made to Capote appear from start to finish, however, and they cannot be satisfactorily justified. The writer and director simply did not trust the abundance of character, suspense and tragedy inherent in the Clutter story, and in attempt to create more drama they undermined their credibility and made the Capote story difficult to believe.Capote finds the Clutter story on the front of the New York Times, travels to Kansas with friend Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), spends three months interviewing the people of Holcomb and the surrounding area, sympathizes with one of the convicted murders, fights to preserve the Sixth Amendment trial rights of Hickock and Smith after their initial conviction, writes the majority of the novel that he tells people was the 'book (he) was meant to write' and one that would be the book of the decade, stops visiting and corresponding with the men, tires of the long and laborious appeals process, and finally attends their executions after a near-catatonic and pathetic experience of self-pity due to the impending doom of his literary subjects. The story follows the basic plot. Capote's eccentricities, effeminate mannerisms and speech patterns are illuminated. One sits in the audience wondering how Nelle Harper Lee of To Kill a Mockingbird fame tolerated her miserable and egoistic companion with such patience, and also fully comes to understand why he ultimately dedicated this labor of obsession 'with (his) love and gratitude' to her and also to his patient lover, Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood). The characters and relationships seem real, but only as real as any Hollywood creation. If the creative team allowed significant changes to one storyline, one might easily assume they did the same to enhance all others.While entertainment value arguably trumps informative value in this film, one cannot fairly criticize its shortcomings without giving credit where credit is due. Futterman told an incredibly paced story with powerful dialogue and memorable images. Miller skillfully directed a talented cast and, as did Capote, subtly developed the murderers into sympathetic human beings despite their faults and horrendous deeds. One cannot point to a weak-link in the cast, but Hoffman unquestionably delivers the most notable performance by capturing the stereotypes that formed a reputation Capote both loathed and purposely exacerbated with his caustic attitude, mannerisms, and oftentimes inexcusable behavior. Capote could not handle criticism. He could not handle situations that he could not control. He was ultra-effeminate. He was ultra-vain. He was Capote, and Hoffman embodied his persona with perfection.One may lament the use of Hollywood devices and the inability to fully trust this film, but it deftly captures the essence of Capote's curiosity, torment, extreme vanity, eccentricity, perseverance, devotion and retreat, desire to be loved, and gradual descent into perpetual misery and alcoholism. Capote cannot escape deserved criticism, but neither can it escape its deserved status as of one of the year's best films.",8,0,1,12 October 2005
The Pianist," Details
","Actual footage from 1939 Warsaw opens director Roman Polanski's film The Pianist. The non-threatening footage hardly sets the mood of the film, but it immediately establishes the time and place and consequently alerts audience members to the specific part of an immense and painful history that will be told through the film. This is a story about German Nazis and Polish Jews. It is a story about raw and arbitrary brutality. It is a story about moments of selfless love, and it is a story about all of the other familiar anecdotes associated with the Jewish Holocaust. But it is also a unique story. It is unique because it tells the story of the Warsaw Ghetto and one of its inhabitants, Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody).Polanski begins with the new story as he promptly introduces Szpilman playing Chopin in a Warsaw radio recording studio, but he quickly retreats from the unfamiliar to the familiar. A man and a woman wrestle with a can of soup, and it spills into the filthy streets; the man falls to his stomach and slithers on the pavement as he devours the thick gruel. People are starving. Armed SS officers use people as puppets when they make awkward couples dance in the streets. People are being humiliated. SS officers interrupt a family dinner, pick up a crippled man in his wheelchair, and casually dump him off the top-story terrace; the family is herded downstairs, ordered to run, and gunned down in the streets. People are being killed. Most people can anticipate what will happen when an angry SS officer randomly selects men from a line and orders them to lie face down on the cobblestone street. The quiet scene of strewn suitcases and dead bodies is haunting but expected. The wooden door of a railcar packed with scared and screaming Jewish people slams shut, but Polanski does not follow the train to its destination because 21st century audiences should know about the gas chambers, the shovels people used to dig their own graves, and the crematoriums waiting at the end of the tracks. People should know about these horrific treatments and events, and many might choose to glance away from the screen during the most graphic scenes. During these moments of elected relief, a person might begin to wonder what happened to Szpilman's story. Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood do well to stay in the Warsaw Ghetto and the surrounding area to keep the narrative focused, but Szpilman gets lost in the general history.The newness exists in the subtle subplot of resistance. When reports of mass killings at Treblinka leaked into the Warsaw ghetto, a surviving group of young men organized the Zydowska Organizacja Bojowa, which translates to Jewish Fighting Organization. The members smuggled a small number of weapons into the ghetto through their burlap sacks of food. They urged Jewish people not to board the railcars. The April 19, 1943, uprising and revolt lasted over one month, a fact not entirely clear in The Pianist, but the German forces ultimately defeated the resistance movement. Still, the Jews had fought back, and their efforts were significant. So significant that one is justified half-way through the film to wonder if Polanski picked the wrong story. Szpilman's story, like every story of a Holocaust victim or survivor, is important and deserves to be told and heard, but the cinematic interest seemed to be occurring away from the camera's scope on the Jewish side of the brick ghetto wall lined with broken glass. By the time of the revolt, Szpilman had escaped and watches the action from a short distance in his hiding place. The audience member is confined to his temporarily protected space and separated from the historical events taking place inside the ghetto. Szpilman laments that he should have stayed with the men even though it would have meant his death, and again only for viewing sake, one might guiltily share his sentiments. Humans, after all, possess a curiosity and a desire to safely experience the most dramatic moments of history, and watching the ghetto crumble in fire from a distant window fails to places a person within the action.But this is the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, the masterful Jewish pianist who escaped his death because of his musical talent under tremendous circumstances, and one would be wise to trust Polanski's choices. There were at least 750 stories within the burning ghetto, but the one followed in The Pianist is equally compelling once the Warsaw ghetto is in ruins and Szpilman's life becomes the sole focal point of the film. Brody speaks as much with his body as he does with his mouth during the second half of the film, and he is equally if not more brilliant in his verbal silence. The circumstances are harsh and nearly unbelievable, and his acting prohibits audience members to blink in fear of missing one moment of the performance. One stops breathing as Szpilman plays dead in the street to avoid actual death. One feels Szpilman's internal emotion when his hands return to the piano keys after a long absence. One tastes the raspberry jam he licks off his boney fingers. Brody says nothing as Szpilman, but the audience understands everything.The Pianist succeeds on every level for numerous reasons including its attention to detail. Polanski provides specific dates associated with movements and events. Three hundred and sixty thousand Jews in the Warsaw district were relocated to the small designated space in the ghetto. Majorek (Daniel Caltagirone) names Treblinka--it isn't just a concentration camp. Details, details, details. The film also succeeds in its ability to speak to current issues. Polanski does not include the story of the merciful Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann) to create sympathy for the German perpetrators. He does not haphazardly highlight the parallels between how the Germans tortured the Jews and then how the Russians tortured the Germans. Violence only begets more violence. Hatred is an epidemic for which no cure exists.",Null,0,0,25 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Tepid Two Towers
","New hideous beasts join the Balrog and Orcs as audience members return to Middle Earth during Director Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.  Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and five other members of the original Fellowship continue their arduous journey to Mordor to destroy the Ring.  Conditions are often intolerable.  Powers clash and collide.  The battles are fierce and unrelenting.  Friendships and alliances are tested.  Innocent people and brave warriors lose their lives.  Love is found and lost and unreturned. The world is simply a darker place.  But even this enormous amount of conflict and drama does not engender a superior sequel to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.The team of screenwriters (Frances Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Stephen Sinclair, and Peter Jackson) undeniably undertook a difficult task in reproducing J.R.R. Tolkien's epic in script form, but this fact does not excuse the film's slow pace and occasional incomprehensibility.  Both major and minor characters are introduced too quickly and little or no time is invested in many of these people, which prevents audience members from connecting and sympathizing with the characters.  Th√©oden (Bernard Hill) orders elderly men and young boys to fight an impossible war, but one cannot connect with the weeping women or terrified men as leaders outfit them in helmets and swords and send them off to a likely death.  The writers have not given audience members the time or reason to care.The overriding theme in The Lord of the Rings is that the good in the world is worth a tremendous fight and that evil cannot prevail despite its overwhelming force, but other themes evolve through various characters and subplots.  Few people can miss the dominating theme; Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) even states this Truth at the end of The Two Towers just in case it has eluded anyone in the story's first six cinematic hours.  Unfortunately, many other themes are lost not simply because of exclusion from the original text, but again, because the writers did not invest enough time in explaining the details and significance of certain events.  Allowing Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) to return momentarily to clarify certain points and clever monologues by Gollum (voice of Andy Serkis) avoid complete disregard for intelligibility, but more of these not-entirely-innovative but nonetheless helpful techniques would have benefited the film.Gollum embodies the possibility that any inherently good creature can be transformed into something evil.  The entire cast delivers laudable performances once again, but this computer generated character steals the spotlight in every one of his scenes.  He appears deformed and acts maliciously, but the writers gave him a tremendous amount of depth and so his deformities and deviance is forgiven.  Gollum is complicated, and he is endearing.  He has become a slave to the desire for power, but traces of his former Sm√©agol self penetrate his dominating ugliness--especially in an intense but entertaining forest monologue.Unfortunately, Gollum also represents the most disturbing reality of the second part of this film series: The Two Towers relies too heavily on its computer generated characters and special effects and not enough on the story and the abilities of its human actors.  Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) prances off boulders and dramatically flies onto a horse during battle, which elicits laughter during serious moments and detracts from Bloom's natural ability to play the part.  The Fellowship of the Ring is not entirely void of these non-human creations, but the focus is on the nine-member Fellowship.  The actors are responsible for the overall success or failure of each scene in the first film, but the exact opposite is true for the second film and pure spectacle does not afford cinematic greatness.Jackson's talented cast is not as present in The Two Towers, but they make a valiant effort to carry the film even through too numerous sweeping landscape scenes.  Still, few of the actors exhibit flawless or even nearly flawless performances.  Wood and John Rhys-Davies, who plays Gimli, occasionally overreact with melodramatic reactions and facial expressions, though it is admittedly the exception to Wood's otherwise skillful and intriguing performance.  Rhys-Davies is particularly guilty of this amateurish act, however, and these poor acting choices coupled with a script that portrays him as a fool cheapens the overall story and discredits the Fellowship.  The most troubling acting problem, however, is the lack of chemistry between the lead male characters excluding the hobbits.  Every single leader is captivating in his individual monologues and scenes, but their camaraderie seems forced and unauthentic.  The camera does most of the work, and the actors rely on background music and other visual effects to compensate for their collective inefficiency.  Thankfully, the believability of all other relationships balances this inadequacy, and newcomer Miranda Otto as √âowyn shines.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers lags behind its predecessor, but Jackson and his cast and crew have created another film well worth the price of a movie ticket.  The story begs for more explanation and the actors are undermined by technology, but the special effects and computer generated characters will keep audience members content through the three hour duration.  One Ring was forged to bind all creatures in the darkness of Mordor--despite the film's faults, don't be the only one to miss this continued journey that will determine if the dark prophecy will come true and send Middle Earth into catastrophic ruin.",7,1,3,18 December 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," almost is not good enough
","Dobby the house elf warns Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) not to return to Hogwarts for his second year of magical lessons soon after the audience receives a taste of Harry's miserable existence with the Dursley family in the opening sequence of director Chris Columbus' Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  Dobby, a computer generated character and one of the special effects that keeps this film moderately entertaining from start to finish, remains ambiguous in his warning but stresses that `terrible things are about to happen!'  Many audience members exit the theater wondering if Dobby spoke of the dangers awaiting Harry at Hogwarts or the trite and threadbare story awaiting theatergoers for nearly three hours of the film's duration.Screeching mandrakes, the howler Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) receives from his mother (Bonnie Wright), a conversational diary, the phoenix, the ghostly Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson), and other special effects including a cinematically superior game of Quidditch make the second Harry Potter film better than the first installment and superficially enjoyable, but spectacle alone cannot sustain a film even in this magical world.  Kenneth Branagh wins the hearts of his female students and audience members in the role of Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Jason Isaacs is notably cold and cruel as Lucius Malfoy, and the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore creates depth for his character amidst the other one-dimensional characters of the film, but these three veterans along with Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall cannot tap their wands and make magic out of Steve Kloves' lackluster script that includes the most exciting events from J.K. Rowling's novel but fails to support these events with other necessary plot points making much of the film random and nonsensical.The young actors including Radcliffe, Grint, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy generally showcase improved performances from their first attempts in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but they all lack the versatility and subtlety of accomplished actors.  None of these amateurish actors attempt to find believable persons within their characters, and consequently each character emerges as a dull caricature.  Harry is the unsuspecting hero.  Ron is the pathetically helpless and bewildered sidekick.  Hermione is the brain of the operation. Draco is the representation of evil.  The script provides only one-dimensional characters, and none of these actors has the ability to create something out of nothing as more skilled performers can do, which adds to the banality of the film.Columbus' first priority for the next film in this series should be to find a screenwriter with a vivid imagination and the creative ability to bring Rowling's world to life.  The cast will miss Harris as Dumbledore and the young actors need a few more lessons in their craft before shooting begins, but with a decent blueprint this cast has the potential to rival anything the imagination could possibly create.  Improvement is a step in the right direction and the film is almost worthy of some acclaim, but as Ron discovered in Professor McGonagall's class, almost is far from perfect and never quite good enough.",6,0,0,2 December 2002
Gangs of New York," Not Perfect but Bloody Close
","***Minor spoilers***Director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Jay Cocks revived the violence, hatred, and lawlessness that governed New York City from the 1840s through the bloody Draft Riots of 1863 in the epic film Gangs of New York.  New York natives despised the poor immigrants that arrived daily by the shipload. Continuous bloodshed resulted from intense racial and religious tensions. Prostitutes and pickpockets roamed the city looking for victims.  Hangings in the square brought together the community and elicited loud cheers of approval.  America was born in the streets, and the New York streets were covered in blood and home to the trampling feet of gangs fighting for territory, dignity, and respect in the developing city.Scorsese wasted no time placing audience members in the time, place, and ambience of this relatively unknown tumultuous era of United States history. Father Vallon (Liam Neeson) carries his cross and marches to a somber beat through the torch-lit catacombs collecting men and women of the Dead Rabbits gang for battle.  A entourage of Irish-Catholics including Happy Jack (John C. Reilly), Hellcat Maggie (Cara Seymour), and Monk (Brendan Gleeson) join the priest before he kicks open the wooden door and steps into the wintry, desolate streets of New York's Five Points.  Young boys including Vallon's son, a present-day Catholic curiosity, accompany the gang but move to the periphery as members of the Bowery Boys lead by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) emerge from their own dilapidated building.  The two leaders exchange battle cries as the people raise their knives and clubs, and the first of many violent sequences ensues.  The pure white snow is defiled with the warm blood of battered members from both gangs before the ensanguined crowd retreats after another day of immense loss.Nearly twenty years pass before the Gangs of New York camera returns to Five Points, and much in the community has changed though violence and corruption still reign.  Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio), the priest's son, returns with the camera after spending his childhood and adolescence in an upstate Catholic orphanage.  The Dead Rabbits are nothing but a memory and no person dares to mention the old gang name.  Members of the fractured gang now offer their loyalties, time, and resources to rival gang leader Bill the Butcher.  Religion died with the priest along with the value and honor attached to both life and death.  Amsterdam steps off the ship with a vengeful heart, but he gradually assumes the role of Bill the Butcher's adopted son and begins to viscerally understand the Dead Rabbits betrayers.
The turbulent relationship between Bill the Butcher and Amsterdam dominates the story from opening to closing credits, but other characters both add and subtract from the richness of this wonderfully shot film.  Henry Thomas delivers the second most admirable performance as Amsterdam's sidekick Johnny Sirocco.  Sirocco recognizes Amsterdam soon after he returns to New York, and out of respect and admiration he offers to help him survive in the city.  Amsterdam commits another kind of betrayal and alienates Sirocco, who then makes a choice between allegiances and consequently engenders another major conflict.  The character is extremely unlearned and his life is dictated by emotions, which makes him prone to irrational behavior and regrets.  Thomas is endearing from his first appearance, and he demonstrates great versatility in a small but important role.Cameron Diaz slips in and out of her Irish accent, does nothing to improve her poorly-written character, and disturbs the otherwise well-devised cast chemistry as coquettish Jenny Everdeane while DiCaprio and Gleeson deliver particularly commendable performances, but Day-Lewis creates a villain that makes the entire film unforgettable.  Bill the Butcher thrives on putting blood on his blade and uses pigs to practice his technique for slaying human beings.  He never flinches at the slaughter, and he almost never feels remorse walking away from his slaughtered victim whether it be beast or man. He personifies all evils associated with the American Dream such as materialism and the insatiable desire for power.  Bill the Butcher is a loathsome character, but Day-Lewis is too good to be hated and wins over the audience just as he wins over Amsterdam with his dynamic personality.  He is never kind and rarely selfless, but he recognizes the nobility of integrity and honors this trait even though it is a quality he knows he will never himself achieve.  This honorable recognition does not nullify his dishonorable disposition, but it gives the character a tremendous amount of depth that Day-Lewis uses to deliver one of the most noteworthy performances of 2002.Gangs of New York is not historically accurate, but the film still teaches audience members about obscure historical events while it entertains for its nearly three hour duration.  The cinematography is beautiful, Scorsese skillfully incorporates violent scenes into the picture but does not include any superfluous violence and allows other important themes to surface alongside this dominating aspect of nineteenth century New York life, DiCaprio's return to the screen after a lengthy absence is impressive and encouraging, and Day-Lewis secures Bill the Butcher's name in American history.  Gangs of New York contains lackluster moments, but overall it is an exuberant epic well worth the price of a movie theater ticket.",8,0,0,2 January 2003
