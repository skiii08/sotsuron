Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's a cash cow.
","And not very good. Filled with lousy acting, bad dialogue, video gamespecial effects, and some bizarre racially inappropriate lines- Jar JarBinks, I think, will go down as Lucas biggest mistake- this Star Wars isthe least of them all. Hopefully Lucas will get back on track with thenext one, because this one left much to be desired. Even the die hardfans I went with were let down.",1,1,2,20 June 2001
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The best of the bunch.
","This is it, folks, it doesn't get any better than this. You know the plot, you know the music, but trust me- this is the one to see. Harrison Ford at his peak, Karen Allen is perfect (why in the world did Spielberg not use her again? She was far superior to the whiny Kate Capshaw) and every supporting actor is spot on. This is the one that started it all, for better or for worse. I'm of the school that thinks the sequels were inferior retreads, but that's neither here nor there- this is a great movie and you should see it already!",1,7,69,17 June 2001
Fight Club," Boys who fight!
","Big strong handsome boys take their shirts off and sweat and fight eachother! Oh boy! Oh yeah, there's a girl in here too (Helena BonhamCarter) but she kind of acts tough like a guy too. Lots of posing andposturing in this film, it's very 'cool'. I found it hollow and couldcare less. Clockwork Orange said it better and was better acted 40 yearsago. Rent that one instead.",1,13,41,20 June 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Wonderfully awful!
","And I mean that as a compliment, this movie must be seen to be believed.It is out of control in a way that will make you cringe away from thescreen as you're laughing your a** off. It has all the jokes from theshow, but as the title says- they're bigger better and uncut. Not onlyis the scatalogical humor intact, but the music is actually pretty good.It really does hold up as a musical, which is no small feat these days.How on earth it lost the academy award to that Phil Collins song isbeyond me. You will love this film.",1,7,37,28 June 2001
Pearl Harbor," One of the worst movies of the decade.
","This is Hollywood at it's worst. Lousy acting, terrible script, one ortwo BIG EFFECTS! and not much else. Oh, yeah- a lot of hype andpublicity, including shills posting 'rave reviews'- but oddly, thesereviews are only for this movie. Anyway, it's bad. Believe the critics,they're trying to save your ten bucks. They have taken an historic eventand tried to turn it into a 'thrill ride', mixed with From Here ToEternity. Do yourself a favor and rent From Here To Eternity, it's areal movie. There is nothing worth seeing in this movie except for thebomb dropping on the ship, and that was in the 'coming attraction'. Thepeople who made Pearl Harbor should be forced to watch this drivel, allthree hours of it, over and over until they have learned their lesson.Really, what could have been going on in their heads?",Null,0,0,20 June 2001
Pi," Beautiful odd and in black and white.
","This is a wonderful ad for independent film making. One of the mostoriginal movies to come out in the 90's, this movie features no stars,an odd story, bizarre camera work, and yet it all comes together andworks marvelously. I won't go into the plot- what I could get of it,that is- except to say that it combines 4 or 5 subjects that you can'timagine going together. I was fascinated the whole time, and yet hadkind of a headache as well. I'm very interested in what this team ofyoungsters does next.",5,0,0,17 June 2001
Annie Hall," Woody Allens best film ever.
","Yep, this is the one. It's fun and fast and thoughtful and smart andsexy and it makes New York City the most romantic city on film. DianeKeaton is marvelous as the title character, she shines as does everysingle actor in this film. Christopher Walken is her brother, in one ofhis early roles, and you can see how it lead to his career today! WoodyAllen perfectly sums up most all romantic relationships in this film,the good and the bad, and he does it in a unique 'American' way, I lovedloved loved this film!",10,0,0,9 June 2001
Once Upon a Time in America," Beautiful.
","I've seen the short version of this, and the long, and believe me, youmust rent the long version. The short one doesn't do it justice. This isan epic and deserves to be seen as such. It's got great performances byDeNiro and Woods as childhood best pals, and the women areextraordinary- Elizabeth McGovern proves again to be an Americantreasure, and Jennifer Connely- yes, that's her!- is perfectly cast asthe child Elizabeth McGovern. This film also has one of the best scoresyou'll ever hear.",7,3,6,28 June 2001
Reservoir Dogs," Sensational.
","This is a great if odd movie, and one that is definitely worth watchingmore than once. Masterfully shot and performed, it's really a callingcard for Pulp Fiction, Tarantinos greatest work so far. Kietel andMadsen give amazing performances, as does Buscemi, Penn, Tarantino etal. And the music really helps tell the story in a way that is hard todefine. Pure cinema adrenaline.",1,4,18,28 June 2001
Pulp Fiction," An amazingly great film.
","This is a superb film in all possible ways.  The acting is astonishing,  the camera work sublime,  and the score is fantastic.  This is the best work Travolta has ever done,  and even Bruce Willis gives a great performance.  A stellar supporting cast includes Tim Roth,  Amanda Plummer,  and Eric Stoltz in the famous 'needle' scene.  Rent this,  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",10,0,0,2 April 2000
Shrek," Great fun, mediocre animation.
","This is a great film for little girls with issues about their looks,it's funny and fast and silly and irreverent.  I only wish the qualityof the film had been better, at times it looked as though Princess Fiona(adequately voiced by Cameron Diaz) was floating instead of walking. Theanimation is not as endearing as the Wallace and Gromit films, or eventhe Disney films, but the whole enterprise has a spirit that isinfectious and great. It pokes holes in lots of fairy tale bunk thatwe've all been weened on since birth. I particularly liked the'gingerbread man' scene, he shows such pluck and vinegar that it madeyou want to stand up and cheer. Kudos to the writers and performers, butI'm less sure about this animation. It looked like a bad dreamsometimes.",1,7,20,9 June 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A great movie.
","I wouldn't say it's THE great movie, but it's the best sci-fi out there.When I first saw this on the big screen, it was shocking. Just a jolt offun after a decade of heavy handed social dramas that were good(serpico) but hardly whiz bang!  Star Wars is a swashbuckling sword epicthat had the audience cheering and yelling, like a ride at Disneyland.Say what you will for how it affected the Box Office and how studioheads now look at summer films- it most likely ruined it for all of usfor a long time, as now they all want HUGE OPENING NUMBERS and saddle uswith bloated 'blockbusters' such as PEARL HARBOR, but Star Wars had/hasa spirit and a life to it that is wonderful to behold. Get it on DVD,you'll have a ball",6,1,6,21 June 2001
Jackie Brown," Very long.
","Yep, apparently no one wanted to tell Quentin Tarantino 'no', so we havean almost three hour movie that loses it's audience quickly. I wanted tolike it, but it's almost like he's daring us not to by staying in scenesfar too long and giving us uninpired performances. I loved RobertForster and Pam Greer, but what was DeNiro doing, and what was BridgetFonda doing? They were cliches of the thug and the bimbo, and I couldcare less about them. To me, the magic of Tarantino is taking onedimensional characters (see Pulp Fiction) and showing us a differentside of them that makes us love them and care about their stories. I gotthat with only a few of the roles in this film. I will always see thismans films, I think he's a major talent, but I hope he sticks with thelesser known actors who will really come through for him and leave the'stars' (unless it's a Travolta like comeback) to other directors.Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction will remain on my shelf, but not JackieBrown. Come back Tarantino! Make another film, and make it cheap fastand out of control!",2,4,14,18 June 2001
