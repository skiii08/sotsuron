Angels & Demons," Enjoyed the book more
","I read the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons - then watched both the movie over a period of time. I think in both cases the movies really lacked substance - and coming from a lightweight like me that is saying something I can tell you.This movie had much, much less content than the book of course and I agree with some of the other reviews - key elements were left out.In the end the movie has some good periods of excitement but it really dips too much in between.I love Rome, I loved the book but I will not be watching this movie again.",4,0,1,9 January 2010
