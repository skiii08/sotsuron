Sucker Punch," A different but nice movie.
","Many of my friend's were criticizing this movie but I find it very unique and mind boggling movie. If you are watching it for action and adventure then you will only love it if you like CGI and hot chicks with weapon. But it is a real treat for 'fantasy' genre. It is not an epic fantasy like 'Lord of the Rings' but it's more like 'Pan's Labyrinth' where boundary between reality and fantasy overlaps. Many people are claiming it to be a senseless movie because of its unrealistic fight scenes and uncleared story but according to me that is the best thing about this movie. The plot, graphics, and story were awesome, Fight scenes were not up to the mark with '300' and 'watchmen' but they were also good. To sum it all: Don't watch this movie if you are not a fan of dark fantasy genre.",Null,1,2,18 September 2011
