The King's Speech," It will fill you with joy
","In opening, I must say this is a film I would recommend to my friends. The story perfectly tells us how Bertie, unfit to be a king, overcome his speech impediment and leads his country through the war. The script is laid out cleverly and the film is well-paced, so we don't have time to be bored. This moving tale is witty and I appreciated the dry British sense of humor.The actor's game is splendid and excellent and I must say everyone did a solid job in this film. Colin Firth's performance is brilliant and Helena Bonham Carter is perfect as the haughty Queen consort. She brightens every scene she enters and the way she encourages her husband is brave and lovely. As Lionel Logue, Geoffrey Rush is very good and very funny. They are all excellent.What is interesting in this film is that it isn't all about the Royal family and their duties. Otherwise, it would have been boring. Colin Firth compels attention and sympathy in order to make the watcher interested. Moreover the pictures are bright and beautiful.All in all, The King's Speech is a must-see film that catches your eyes and tears at your guts. Full of emotions, this biopic is perfect and you can see it twice without being bored. It will just fill you with joy.",9,0,0,12 May 2011
