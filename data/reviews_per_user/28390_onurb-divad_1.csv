Kill Bill: Vol. 2," What did you kill Bill?
","The Beatles song about Bill is more exciting. Don't give us much, just boring minutes... Tarantino tries to give us a family-conflict-dramatic plot... Doesn't work. Just bad and boring. Overrated flick. I like Tarantino otherwise, but this i just bad, sad... to say. In this sequel to the first one, he forget what he he is best at, telling a good story. This is just boring. Ten lines OK... It is boring, and doesn't com up to the quality of Tarantino as usual.. If you are a fan of Tarantino it's all right I guess. But for me this was a disappointment. No suspense, a good storytelling, no... Just extremely bad. Extremely overrated this film is I believe... Tarantino can when he wants, here he didn't.",4,2,4,28 June 2015
