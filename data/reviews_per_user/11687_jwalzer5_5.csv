Spartacus," SPARTACUS: a flawed masterpiece
","As a student of Roman history, I generally cast a jaundiced eye on Hollywood epics dwelling on ancient Rome.  They're either camp, like 'QUO VADIS' (Robert Taylor's impersonation of an actor is particularly unsettling), or badly researched and preachy, like the incredibly overrated, 'BEN-HUR' (starring Charlton Heston, and his flying circus of facial tics).  Given Hollywood's miserable track record in handing out awards (i.e., 'How Green was my Valley' over 'Citizen Kane'??? --- enough said), it is telling that 'Ben-Hur' snagged 11 Oscars, including Chuck's, but 'Spartacus' was virtually ignored (Ustinov's wonderful rendering of Lentulus Batiatus excepted).And yet, as history, 'Spartacus' is a terrific film.  There are, inevitably, inconsistencies: the real Gracchus (played by Charles Laughton), was dead fifty years before Spartacus' rebellion occurred and Spartacus himself died in the film's final battle - he was NOT crucified, an imaginary incident conjured by Douglas to allow for a heart-breaking farewell scene with Jean Simmons - this is regrettable, but forgivable, dramatic license. Overall, however, 'Spartacus' is one of the few films that can withstand historical scrutiny. In one of many brilliant scenes, Olivier and his brother-in-law, spectators at the gladiatorial school run by Ustinov, cavalierly discuss politics, oblivious to the fact that, in the arena below, two men are fighting for their lives.  Their detachment from the slaughter being perpetrated, ostensibly for their amusement, is a vivid and unforgettable reminder that barbarism once passed for entertainment.  And the now-'Un-infamous' scene where Tony Curtis and Olivier make homoerotic small talk is not only tame by today's standards, but quite realistic, given what we now know of the bisexual nature of many upper-class Roman men in the first century B.C.E.There is one other flaw in 'Spartacus': namely the sanctimonious condemnation of slavery in the opening narration.  Nearly all of Hollywood's films about ancient Rome -- indeed, the ancient world in general -- incorporate this tired, pompous disclaimer about slavery and the pernicious effect it had on whatever civilization is being targeted: we need to be reminded that here, in the USA, the evil that was slavery flourished for a hundred years, as it flourished for centuries in Britain, Russia, Spain, and China: the United States of America endorsed and approved slavery, and certain areas in this country still tolerate racism, misogyny, and homophobia -- but we would resent any entity that would consider those flaws an embodiment of the American Mind.  Oppression was no more typical of the Roman Empire than Mississippi is typical of the United States (thank GOD!). We should remember that before we condemn a culture that survived for over 2200 years (from the founding of Rome in 753 BCE to the fall of Constantinople in 1453 CE). Finally, Alex North's wind-and-brass-besotted, jagged score is wonderfully appropriate and especially effective in the military scenes.  This is one of the few films I felt compelled to buy, so as to have my own copy.  It is flawed, but only because Douglas aimed so high, and it remains one of the few films that I term, 'great.'",10,33,64,26 May 2002
Shaun of the Dead," An unexpected delight
","This was one of those films that sneaks up on you. Jaded by endless inferior sequels and re-makes, I approached this film with some trepidation but was pleasantly surprised. 'Night of the Living Dead' ripoffs are so common, one often has an aversion to parodies of this sort which have become a genre of their own. Nevertheless, this is a good-natured satire which this viewer found very entertaining. The characters are quirky without being bizarre, and there is a good deal of amusing self-parody - for instance, having one of the characters improbably exclaim, 'we're going to get you, Barbara,' referencing one of 'Living Dead's' most well-known lines. All in all, a nice twist on a horror theme that is in danger of petrifying itself out of existence.",9,0,1,6 February 2005
Alexander," Unwarranted criticism
","I am not a big fan of Oliver Stone, but I think, 'Alexander' has gotten a very bad rap. I thought, 'Platoon' was great, but 'Born on the Fourth of July' sucked. Nevertheless, 'Alexander' was visually stunning and I think it's detractors are more motivated by homophobia than concern for artistic excellence. Alexander's love for Hephastion was beautiful and should be celebrated not deprecated. The film's critics should take a good long long in the mirror. Alexander was one of the the greatest Kings the Western World has ever known. He deserves better from his critics than the kind of cheap polemics to which he has been subjected. The world certainly deserves better.",10,3,12,14 November 2005
Braveheart," Mooning is the film's highlight
","I am, admittedly, not a Mel Gibson fan.  But the laurels accorded this film by critics and the Academy make a response obligatory.  This is one of the WORST films about medieval England ever made.  Because of Mel's self-adulation, his enemies must always appear in the worst light, justified or not.  And so we have Mel as William Wallace, in reality a rogue and vagrant, who even the nobles of Scotland would not tolerate, as he was a commoner and beneath their contempt; and we have Edward I, who some historians have dubbed, 'the greatest English King', and 'the English Justinian' because he was a lawyer, statesman, soldier, etc.  In other words, a stellar King, and an admired and effective ruler.  But, wait: in Mel's hands, William Wallace (who he conveniently portrays) becomes a democratic model spouting egalitarian principles totally at odds with the England of 1299 and more redolent of America, 1776: and -- BIG SURPRISE -- as Mel's opponent, Edward I is trashed by Patrick McGoohan, who plays the character as a combination of Darth Vader and Heinrich Himmler.  Mel wears the White Hat and his enemies wear the Black Hat - get it??  Some films, like 'Spartacus' and 'The Lion In Winter' and 'Glory' are fairly faithful to history; others, like 'A Man for All Seasons' and 'Anne of The Thousand Days' contain nuggets of truth, couched in gorgeous scenery and period costumes.  And then there's, 'Braveheart' - a film that might fascinate Mel's fans, but which leaves everything to be desired where historical truth is concerned. 'Braveheart' is the kind of cheesy junk that future generations will term, 'so bad, it's good.' 'Glen or Glenda' and 'Braveheart': one hell of a double feature.",1,19,44,1 June 2002
The Wizard of Oz," Ttimeless and Exquisite.
","Anyone who has not seen this film does not know what cinema is. The term, 'classic' is far too loosely used but I know of no film more aptly designated. I saw it first when I was 6 years old and I can think of no film that so delighted and enchanted me. Munchkintown was a riot of color that left a lasting impression, Billie Burke, as Glinda, Good Witch of the North, was the incarnation of grace and beauty - and was there ever a more hideous Wicked Witch than Margaret Hamilton? - She scared the Hell out of me and gave me nightmares for days afterwards - talk about a tribute to an actress's performance. It's hard to believe that Ray Bolger as a second choice for the Scarecrow - the Studio originally wanted Jack Haley, who, ironically, became the TinMan! The wonderful Frank Morgan, whose kind nature brought such sweetness to his portrayal of the Wizard was a second choice - the studios wanted W.C. Fields, whose sour nature would, I believe, have left a bitter, aftertaste in the role of Professor Marvel which I believe Frank Morgan fulfilled far more capably. A glorious production.",10,2,4,10 July 2005
