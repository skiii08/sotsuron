Gremlins," Don't miss the message...
","Yes, the Mogwai are cute.  Yes, the gremlins are funny.  But, we're missing the message...Gremlins is great because it is one of the most biting anti-consumerism movies in history.  This film is loaded with little statements about American lives being over gadgetized and how this love for 'Gizmos' could eventually lead to our downfall.  Just ask Mr. Futterman...There are also tons of little jabs at man's attempt to control nature and failing (even Billy's attempts to wrangle his dog are unsuccessful).Look for some of the great skewed camera angles when something weird is about to happen.  Also, the many shots where Red, White, and Blue are prominent in the frame.  Not artistry, think again!",Null,0,2,11 July 2002
The Dark Knight," Got $10? See it again...
","I am not kidding when I say it was the best movie I've seen in 10 years! The Joker was basically painted as a half-crazed homicidal terrorist. I found it chilling, disturbing, and relevant to today's issues. Although Heath Ledger was amazing as the Joker, the story / screenplay was phenomenal. I can't believe something that well written and directed came out of the Hollywood of late. I'm sure that the studio execs won't truly understand why it was a huge success. It's not the budget or the performances (though they were very good). It was the execution. The screenplay and direction made Batman a real human experience full of anguish and sacrifice.A side note to the Academy, it's time to nominate a superhero movie.",10,2,5,20 July 2008
