It," Horror Movie of the Year
","Well, it's no only an horror movie, there's an emotional story between these kids, which by the way, the cast is perfect. Bill Skaarsgard as Pennywise is absolutely terrifying. At a first look doesn't felt like that but when you see him in action it's scary as f***. Andy Muschietti have proved us that he loves the genre, he made a good adaptation of the book.",9,2,3,2 October 2017
