Howl's Moving Castle," An Epic adventure!
","Following the success of Spirited Away, we all knew that Studio Ghibli would be back with another fascinating animated adventure, and so they did, in the magnificence that is Howl's Moving Castle. What can I tell you but it is a brilliant piece of film, successfully captivating audiences in it's bright colours, wonderful scenes, incredibly deep storyline, and that's not even half of what this film has to offer!The story begins in a coastal town where an insecure girl named Sofi owns a hat shop. On her way into town is confronted by a legendary wizard known as Howl and rescued from a group of strange morphing henchmen. She is immediately fascinated by his charms as is he but their meeting is short-lived as he disappears into the crowds soon afterwards. Later that evening, she is confronted in her shop by an overweight woman known as the Witch of the Waste, who begins to make snide remarks about her and her shop. When Sofi takes offence at her comments, the Witch punishes her by cursing her with the body of a hagged old lady, she is also unable to explain about the curse to anyone. With her inability to explain, she decides to leave home and venture into the Wastes outside of town, there, with the assistance of a strange hopping scarecrow, she manages to climb aboard Howl's Moving Castle, taking shelter from the cold winds. There, she meets the heart of the Castle known as Calcifer, a fire demon that gives the castle it's life with his power. Throughout the rest of the film, it is up to her, Howl, Calcifer and a young boy named Markl to help stop the war that is raging between theirs and a neighbouring nation, as well as keeping Howl free from being forced to fight in the war as wizards who do degenerate into Mindless Monsters.Again, a wonderful film that truly demonstrates the finest in animation skills and some of the greatest storyline's I have ever come across. A truly enchanting film that is well worth a watch!",10,0,1,6 August 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An Okay restart to the Franchise
","Star Wars Episode I for me was one of my favourite Childhood films, it was fast paced, it was action packed and it had some interesting characters, except for the one creature that many consider to have been the downfall of this entire movie, Jar Jar Binks. Indeed an obvious gimmick used for comedic reference, but the problem is after the first few minutes of his insatiable babbling it becomes totally obnoxious. And apart from that, he contributes next to nothing to the entire movie, bar leading Obi Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jinn to the underwater city of Otho Gunga. Other than that he is just a useless character who spends a majority of his time being beaten up by thugs, blasted by tanks, shot at by speeder bikes, nearly run over by transport craft and getting thrown from his own horse (or, duck like thing, I don't know...). If you exclude this ridiculous character, the film isn't all that bad, the story is very well written as it introduces many pivotal characters such as Obi Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and many other Jedi Master's of the original Trilogy such as Yoda, as well as giving a better background to where they came from.So the story begins above the Planet Naboo where Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi Wan Kenobi are masquerading as Ambassadors to the Supreme Chancellor to help resolve a Trade Dispute that has the planet blockaded. However, they are soon recognised as Jedi and after consulting the mysterious Darth Sidious, a sentenced to death. Escaping their pursuers, they sneak aboard a landing craft which is part of a massive invasion of the Planet of Naboo. Upon arrival on the planet, the pair come across the Comic Relief and he leads them to Otho Gunga. After mind-tricking the Gungan Leader Boss Nass out of existence, the pair leave aboard a small craft under the partial guidance of Jar Jar Binks to navigate their way to the Capital City of Theed via the planet's water based core. After coming across some nasty underwater beasties, the trio arrive at the city only to find that it has been overrun by the Droid Army of the Trade Federation. After rescuing the Queen from her Captors, they make it aboard the Royal Spaceship, but it is damaged whilst escaping the blockade. With Power fading, the ship is forced to land on the nearby Planet of Tatooine where they hope to gain parts to repair the ship. Whilst in a small parts store, they come across a strange young boy named Anakin Skywalker who agrees to help them pay for the parts by competing in the Boonta Eve Pod-Race, an incredibly dangerous sport with no apparent rules, but with little option, they have no choice. At the same time, Qui Gon senses that the Force is strong with the child and after a blood test, it is found that he is stronger with the force than any other Jedi known, which leads him to believe that he is 'The Chosen One'. What will happen to our hero's? Will Anakin be able to win the race and thereby allow them to get their parts? Will Naboo ever be saved? Only the movie holds the answer...As mentioned, an interesting story with some complex nature, although I do feel that there is a little too much comparison with the Nativity Story with there being immaculate conception, and of course, Jar Jar Binks, who has been and continues to be panned by critics. Other than that, the acting is pretty good although it can be quite bland sometimes and some of the special effects may need a little work. Other than that, a great little film for the kids.",6,1,4,29 August 2012
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," An interesting Bridge for the Prequel Trilogy
","Like Star Wars Episode V, Attack of the Clones doesn't really introduce many pivotal characters that will appear throughout the entire series, it mainly develops the characters that already exist such as Anakin and Obi Wan, Yoda, Mace Windu, Padme Amidala and so forth. This film mainly demonstrates Anakin's path towards darkness and how events in this film drag him closer and closer to the evil that he will become. The acting is certainly upgraded from the previous Star Wars movie, with Anakin being the more emotional and hate filled adult who has many conflicting emotions including the fear of losing his loved ones, his secret love for Padme and the hatred and anger that develops throughout the film, thereby following word for word Yoda's teachings of Episode's I and V. And do I need to mention the fact that there is little to no Jar Jar Binks in this movie?The film begins on Coruscant, with Senator Amidala's Royal Ship arriving at a Landing Platform, however, the ship is blown up by an unseen assassin. Padme is however disguised as one of the fighter pilots and her bodyguard disguised as her is killed in the blast. After meeting with the Chancellor, it is decreed that Jedi Master Obi Wan Kenobi and his Apprentice Anakin Skywalker will be assigned as her bodyguards. Almost immediately, a relationship brews between Anakin and Padme, but it is against the teachings of the Jedi for them to be in love as it results in fear for their loss and begins a path to the Dark Side. That evening however, the assassin's try to kill her again, this time with poisonous centipede like creatures. Sensing their presence, the two Jedi quickly dispatch the vicious creatures and after a long Speeder chase through the city, the pair eventually catch up with the would-be assassin, but she is quickly killed by a mysterious figure which jet-packs away before she can give away who hire her. The next day, Obi Wan takes the poisonous dart to a former Prospector and Diner Chef named Dax, who identifies it as a Kamino Sabre Dart. Meanwhile, Anakin and Padme are advised to leave for Naboo disguised as peasants for safety and the pair slowly begin to express their love for one another. Meanwhile, Obi Wan eventually finds the Planet Kamino and find that they are creating a mysterious Clone Army that was apparently ordered by one of the Jedi Master's. The design of the Clone Troopers is based on that of a resident Bounty Hunter named Jango Fett, and his Cloned son Boba Fett. Whilst attempting to capture Jango, a small fist-fight ensues and Jango escapes, but not before Obi Wan can place a tracker on this ship. Meanwhile, Anakin's fear for the loss of his mother escalates to a peak and the pair fly off to Tatooine to find her, where it is revealed that she has been captured by a group of Tuscan Raiders. Disobeying his orders from the Council, Anakin sets out to find her. Meanwhile, Obi Wan follows Jango Fett to the Planet Geonosis, where after a small skirmish in the Asteroid Belt orbiting the planet, he manages to sneak onto the planet surface and begins to investigate the Trade Federation presence on the Planet. Meanwhile, Anakin eventually finds the Tuscan Village and his mother who has been brutally tortured by the savages. After dying in his arms, Anakin gives into his anger and slaughters the lot of them. Meanwhile, Obi Wan discovers that the assassinations were planned by the former Trade Federation Viceroy from the previous episode with the help of Qui Gon's former Master Count Dooku, who is planning to make another Droid Army to conquer the Republic. Whilst relaying his message to the Council, Obi Wan is captured and so Anakin and Padme take it upon themselves to rescue him. Will they be able to save him in time? Who will stop this evil droid army? Only the film holds the key to the truth...It is an interesting film but certainly one of the weaker ones. Indeed many pivotal characters such as Boba Fett and Count Dooku are introduced, but it is mainly based on the development of the previously introduced characters and thereby bridging the gap between Episode I and Episode III. Again, a really good film for the kids and certainly an enjoyable watch.",6,0,2,29 August 2012
Spirited Away," A Fantastic Piece of Animation that cannot be overlooked
","This truly is Japanese animation and story writing at it's finest, Spirited Away combines fantasy and romance through the magic that is animation, and when I say animation, what I really mean is absolutely fantastic animation! This film has so many brilliant aspects put together to create a piece of cinematic theatre that really does top the bill! The characters are complex and well developed, the soundtrack is brilliant, the scenery and layout of the locations is memorising and to top it all off, it has a fantastic story that is really very original.The story begins with a lazy ne'er-do-well girl named Chihiro and her family arriving at their new town. Whilst en-route, they come across an old country lane which they mistake for being the way to their new house. At the end of the lane is a dark tunnel. They get out of the car and begin to walk down it on foot with Chihiro reluctantly in tow. At the other end they arrive in what appears to be an old train station and beyond that a wide open field with what appears to be an abandoned Amusement Park on the other side. As the trio explore the amusement park, the parents get an insatiable urge to eat all the food at one of the stalls. Even though Chihiro tries in vain to stop them, she eventually goes off to explore elsewhere. Finally she comes across a castle which is stood upon its own precipice with only a wooden bridge connecting it to the land. As she takes a step onto the bridge, she is suddenly confronted by a strange boy who demands that she leaves immediately. When she tries to get her parents, it is revealed that they have been transformed into Pigs and that the wide field has now been turned into a river the size of the English Channel. Unable to return to what could only be described as 'The Mainland', the strange boy from before assists her in reaching the strange castle without gathering the attention of the animal like spirits that have inhabited the Amusement Park. Successfully getting her onto the castle grounds, the boy leaves her to confront the Spider like Boiler-man Kamaji and demand a job from him. She is eventually taken upstairs by another woman named Lin. As she enters the castle, it is revealed that it is in fact a spiritual bath house where all kinds of spirits come to cleanse themselves. With the help of Lin and another Spirit, she eventually reaches the office of the evil witch Yubaba, the owner of the Bathhouse. Following the advice the boy gave her earlier, she demands that she be given a job to save her from being transformed into an animal. Yubaba reluctantly agrees in order to stop Chihiro's yelling from disturbing her over-sized baby and she is forced to work in the Bathhouse as a servant girl. Can Chihiro work for her freedom? What will become of her parents? Can she return to the normal world? You have to watch this masterpiece to find out!Overall, a fantastic piece of cinema that I recommend to people of all ages. Even if there was no dialogue, no sounds, just the soundtrack, I'm sure through the artistry and craftsmanship of the animation you'd be able to fathom what the story is. It is a wonderful film!",10,0,1,6 August 2012
Quantum of Solace," Really taking a step backwards
","After the success of Casino Royale, you'd Quantum of Solace to do nothing but keep up the brilliant work that was put into its predecessor...Oh how mistaken we were...This film has really taken the subtlety and class of the previous film and thrown it away in order to accommodate some of the more idiotic themes of the previous Bond films we'd hoped never to see again. All of the moronic dancing girls in the title scene, the over the top killing scenes, the ridiculous one liners, the going to bed with every girl in sight that was taken away in Casino Royale has shamefully been returned when there was so much promise that could have been done. A majority of the criticism for this film came from viewers who didn't understand the story unless they watched Casino Royale before hand. Since I've watched both that's not a problem for me, however, everything else about this movie is...Within the first 5 seconds, you can probably tell the one fundamental flaw with this film. The camera angles are so short and flashy, I'm surprised we all haven't been reduced to gargling simpletons on the living room floor. The camera's just cannot take a scene and develop it for more than half a second. One second Bond is being chased, less than half a second later and after a dizzy flash of about 5 or 6 shots, the bad guy's car is falling off a cliff. I really cannot fathom what is going on.Overall, this is an unmitigated mess with no real originality. So much so they even reused the gag from Goldfinger where the girl is painted in Gold, only this time she's painted in oil. I'm not sure what Skyfall is going to be like, but I hope to God it goes back to the good old ways of Casino Royale in order to rescue the Bond Franchise once again!",3,2,3,15 September 2012
Independence Day," If the word Epic was a movie, this would be it!
","This film is really what brought Sci Fi back in the mid-1990s, bringing together some of the best Special Effects with an all star cast, a soundtrack that was written in gold and a way about it that is not beyond the realms of reality. Independence Day is a real collection of brilliance, combining the typical B Movie story of the 1960s with the technology of the 1990s, and Roland Emmerich's magic wand of directing blends it to perfection!The story is your typical sort of B Movie thing, Aliens arrive, cause trouble, so we kill them, the end. But the way its executed is what makes it unique to other films of similar genre, and all of these points are entirely plausible. The Aliens seem plausible, the plot seems plausible, the way we destroy the aliens seems plausible, the characters and their backgrounds seem plausible, so generally, this film doesn't stray too far from reality, which makes it better than other films which would have us believe that we destroyed the aliens using pop-tarts catapulted from the side of Mount Rushmore.Overall, a really good film to watch, although it can be quite scary for some younger audiences as well as the use of bad language and battle violence, its just a great little film to watch, just sit back and enjoy the ride! :D",10,0,0,18 July 2012
Twilight," If Misery was a film, this would be it...
","This film is so downhearted and miserable, that I wouldn't be surprised if all the people who watched this movie turned into Manic Depressants and Suicidal's. This film and it's following sequels are a nonsensical mess of Vampire love that goes wrong and a list of people who have no personality. The worst of it all, is the leading lady Bella, a 17 year old who believes she's been dealt the worst card in life and feels that she is tortured from day to day even though she has no problems at all. She then goes on to get enticed with Edward Cullen, a Vampire who doesn't want to get involved with her because of his secret truth. But once she finds out and after Edward has to fight off his siblings before they rip her throat out, she decides that she wants to marry him and become a Vampire herself even though everyone including Edward has said with absolute certainty that it's throwing her life away. So he distances himself from her in order to protect her, only to find that she takes the idea of Attention Seeking to a whole new level by driving motorbikes into trees and jumping off cliffs, this really is a good message to convey to girls who have just lost their boyfriends, Jumping off cliffs and crashing motorbikes is the only way to get him back and teach him what he's done his wrong, the only problem is you may be slightly dead at the end of it.Anyway, she then goes and gets intimate with another boy who seems much more supportive and caring than Edward, only to find that she dumps him in like a second because Edward looks at her funny across the Cafeteria. This causes another war like situation between the Vampires as to who gets to devour her blood. Eventually, Edward wins and he agrees to marry her, only to find she goes off with the boy from earlier again. This character is the most manipulative and self centred creature I have ever seen in film, and makes me beg the question who the real bad guy is anyway?Overall, this film is a depressing dunce of sadness, it makes little to no sense, the characters are unspeakably bland and by far the worst part of it is Bella. If someone like her ever existed, they'd probably be a bane on teenage boys everywhere. Stupid, Stupid, Stupid!!",1,8,11,15 August 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," An enjoyable ending to the Star Wars Franchise
","So Star Wars has come full circle, with this final instalment of the Star Wars saga, Anakin's final transformation into the Dark Lord, Darth Vader. Much like Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith has some very good acting from the main characters and really does capture the emotions of our heroes as they turn against one another in a daring battle between good verses evil. However, many scenes are rather spontaneous and for the uninitiated, the opening scene of the massive battle above Coruscant is explained in the 2003 Cartoon Series, Star Wars the Clone Wars, where the final 3 or 4 episodes cover the story involving the battle and the capture of Chancellor Palpatine by the Droid Leader General Grievous.As mentioned, the opening to this movie begins above Coruscant with a vicious and brutal battle taking place. Recently returning from another mission, Anakin and Obi Wan are assigned to rescue the Chancellor from General Grievous' flagship 'The Invisible Hand'. After making it aboard, the pair fight their way to the main observation tower before confronting the evil Count Dooku. After removing both of his hands, Anakin avenges himself upon the Sith Lord under the persuasion of the Chancellor. However, the trio are captured and brought before the General, after a quick battle in the Bridge, the ship plummets from the sky, eventually crashing down onto a landing platform where the trio make it from the battered hull pretty much unscathed. After taking the Chancellor back to the Senate, Anaking and Padme reunite where it is revealed that she is Pregnant with his child. However he begins to have frightened nightmares about losing her and he slowly begins to fall to the other Dark emotions such as anger and frustration. He also begins to question the loyalty of the Jedi Council to the Republic after he is assigned to spy on the Chancellor. Invited to an Opera Performance, the Chancellor plays on his fears of loss and tells Anakin a story of how a Sith Lord was able to stop those he loved from dying using the force, which plays on Anakin's mind. Meanwhile, Obi Wan is called away to Utapau where it is revealed that General Grievous and the Seperatist leaders have been hiding out. After a long and complicated battle and chase through the Utapau caverns, Obi Wan eventually kills the General by blasting his internal organs with a gun. Back on Coruscant, Chancellor Palpatine reveals himself as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, and Anakin grants him mercy due to his mixed emotions. However, Mace Windu and a few other Jedi Master's confront the Sith Lord and after a brutal fight in the Chancellor's apartment, Mace Windu has the dark lord cornered. But Anakin arrives and saves the Sith Lord from Mace Windu by slicing off his hand before he is blasted out of a window with Force Lightning. With no other choice, Anakin pledges himself to Darth Sidious and is thereby dubbed Darth Vader. His first order of business is to destroy the Jedi Council by invading the Jedi Temple and slaughtering all inside. Meanwhile an order is given to Clone Legions across the Galaxy to kill any Jedi they come across, including Obi Wan and Yoda. However, the pair escape and rendezvous with Senator Organa on his ship the Tantive IV. Unaware of the events on Coruscant and Anakin's conversion to the Dark Side, the group attempts to sneak into the Jedi Temple to send out a message to any remaining Jedi to stay away from Coruscant, in the meantime finding out that Anakin has become the sinister Darth Vader. Meanwhile, Vader has travelled to Mustafar to slaughter the Seperatist Leaders whilst Darth Sidious proclaims himself Emporer Palpatine and thereby creates the Galactic Empire. After telling Padme that Anakin has fallen into Darkness, she desperately goes to Mustafar to find him, with Obi Wan stowing aboard. Believing her to have betrayed him, Vader chokes her half to death before beginning a long and complicated fight scene with his former master and friend. Meanwhile, Yoda attempts to face the Emporer head on in a vicious fight scene within the Senate. However, Yoda is defeated and after escaping Corsucant, goes into exile. Meanwhile, our two heroes find themselves riding the rivers of Lava as they battle to the end and after attempting to slice down on Obi Wan, Vader has his arm and legs cut off before falling down the slope. In the immense heat, he catches fire and is badly mutilated, Obi Wan leaving his fallen friend to burn on the slopes. However, Vader uses the force to save himself from death and the Emporer arrives in time to take him back to Coruscant, where he is rebuilt and placed into the Black Armour. Meanwhile, Padme gives birth to Anakin's children, Luke and Leia before passing away. It is then decided amongst the group that Senator Organa will bring up Leia as his own whilst Obi Wan takes Luke to Anakin's brother and sister-in-law to be brought up by them before they all go into exile. All the while, Darth Vader and the Emporer preside over the construction of their Ultimate Weapon, the Death Star...As mentioned, some great acting and some incredible special effects, in my mind a great way to end one of the most famous Film Franchises ever to hit the cinema's. There are many depressing scenes within the movie which I wouldn't recommend for younger kids but apart from that, its quite a good film for all sorts of ages and definitely worth a viewing.",7,0,2,29 August 2012
Casino Royale," My favourite James Bond movie!
","This film takes everything a good spy thriller needs, and puts it all in, Shaken, but not Stirred. It's smooth, it's cool, it's unbelievably subtle, there's no Overly Complicated Killing Scenes, no long winded sex scenes, no ten a penny girls and most importantly, it has a story that stands up on it's own!The film begins in Cold War Czechoslovakia, where Bond is sent to kill a British Agent who has been selling secrets to the Soviets. This is before Bond has been issued a 00X rank and has to have at least two kills under his belt before he can be given such a prestigious but dangerous rank. In previous flashbacks, Bond is seen killing the agent's contact in a bathroom, his first kill. Bond then achieves his rank by nonchalantly dispatching the agent. What follows is what has to be the best opening to a movie I have ever seen in my entire life. A fast paced thrill ride of flying cards, henchmen being killed by clubs, Kings, Queens, Jacks and Aces, and not a single one of those monotonous dancing girls in sight! (This is where I knew this film was going to be a good-en!)We then move to Uganda, where a Freedom Fighter is setting up an account with a financier names Le Chiffre, who works through an organisation known as SOLICE to fund terrorist groups throughout the globe. Le Chiffre is a subtle but calculative character, sly in motive, but sinister in appearance, and one of my favourite Bond villains. We then move to Madagascar, where Bond and a fellow agent are tracking a bomb-maker. After his assistant is spotted, Bond proceeds the chase the Bombmaker through a Construction Site and into the Namibian Embassy. Violating all international codes, Bond enters the building and takes the man hostage before dispatching him and escaping. In his backpack, Bond finds a set of explosives and a text message on his phone with the word 'Elipsis' written. Meanwhile, News spreads across the World about Bond's rash invasion of the Embassy, and M and Bond have a heart to heart conversation about how she is ready to feed him to the press if he doesn't stop his rash behaviour. But this is not before Bond has tracked the origin of the text to a location in the Bahamas.Continuing his mission, Bond arrives at a Seaside hotel and after creating a rather humorous distraction, scans the security tapes to find that the person who made the text was a Greek man named Alex Dimitrios, a known Arms Dealer and hirer of mercenaries. Bond introduces himself to Dimitrios in a game of Poker, in which Bond emasculates him by taking a large portion of his money and of course, his Aston Martin DB5. After seducing his girlfriend, Bond is able to learn that Dimitrios is flying to Miami. Bond follows him to an art museum where he sees Dimitrios place a baggage tab on a Poker chip. After a subtle attempt to murder Bond, the Secret Agent gets the upper hand and quietly kills Dimitrios. Upon returning to the Poker chip, he finds it missing and after using Dimitrios' mobile phone to track the agent, Bond follows him back to the airport. Disguised as an Airport Security Officer, the agent sets off the alarm and steals a fuel truck in order to crash it into a Skyfleet Prototype Jetliner. This will send Market's Tumbling and since Le Chiffre has bet against the markets, it will make him a rich man and allow him to fund his terrorist groups. Bond is hot on his tail as the pair have a long fight in the cab of the tanker truck. The agent sets a bomb underneath the cab and jumps out. Bond is able to stop the truck with inches to spare and is arrested by Police. The smug looking agent sets off the bomb but realises that Bond has attached it to his belt, blowing him up.Because the stock markets didn't fall as he wanted them to, Le Chiffre searches for a new way to get his money back by setting up an all steaks game at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. Bond joins the game, and on the way meets with his new assistant Vesper Lynd, an agent for the Treasury, who is there to make sure the money goes where necessary. Can Bond beat Le Chiffre in the game and save the much needed millions? Is there a relationship brewing between the reluctant Vesper and Bond? Only the movie has the answer...As mentioned, this film is just, fantastic! It really is. I loved every minute of it and could watch it over and over again. No cocky one liners, no half baked schemes, just some good honest British Spy Action! Give this Director a knighthood!",10,3,5,29 August 2012
Signs," I don't know how this is so popular!
","For a film that is supposed to have been the thing that made Shyamalan what many describe as the next Spielburg, there are too many things wrong with this movie. The main points of interest being the Characters, the Story and worst of all, the fact that they actually state out loud why the movie is doomed to fail.First off, lets start with the characters. They're all as bland as is humanly possible. Everyone seems to have a problem talking in this movie because they resort to whispering, even when the situation isn't tense enough to require it. Also, no one seems to have an emotion, they literally just say their lines. Mel Gibson seems to just monotonously deliver his lines, and don't get me started on Rory Culkin, who seems to have kept up his family tradition of blank, emotionless faces that seem to come naturally to them because no one else on earth could put on such a boring face even if they tried. Also, the children speak like adults and the adults speak like children. Whilst Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix discuss yelling and acting crazy to scare away the aliens, Rory Culkin is busy describing the fate of the future and the earth to his sister like he was some kind of Einstein trapped in a child's body. Children do not act like this in reality, rather than discussing what their kids might think of their current situation, they'd be running around waving their arms in the air panicking, if not they'd be thinking about what's on TV tonight.Second of all, the story is rather inconsistent. It has Mel Gibson as the distraught father who lost his wife to a car accident and this is somehow woven into an alien invasion. However, the points at which they choose to reflect on Gibson's troubled past are so ridiculously timed. For example, whilst the alien is holding his son hostage, he decides to have a 5 minute flashback to when his wife died. As for myself, I'd be thinking of a way to get this alien off my son and kill it and leave the contemplation of my past to another day. The flashback scene of his wife dying would have had a more appropriate appearance say when he was lying awake in bed thinking of the past, like it does in most other films. Also there are many characters who say really odd lines which you may think are important who don't appear again, just 5 second cameos of people saying things that could be important to the situation, but they again just disappear.And thirdly and most damningly, the fact that they state out loud why the film can't work. The planet is being invaded by a technologically superior race of aliens who have travelled light-years to get here, but they can't break through Pantry Doors! Whoever thought that up needs to be kicked for being so stupid! You can't be this idiotic! If the aliens had trouble working with doors, say they were allergic to wood or something, they would have built a device to help them overcome this problem, but nope, they came all this way just to have their grand invasion plan brought to a grinding halt by a wooden door!Also, the aliens are harmed when they come into contact with water, it melts them. Well, perhaps they should have realised that critical point before they decided to invade a planet where 2/3s of its surface are covered in this harmful substance. The first rainstorm they come across (and if they've invaded the United Kingdom that's only minutes away), they'll be running down the drains in no time! You'd think also that they'd prepare for such an eventuality, like, oh I don't know, creating some protective suit or something so that they can't be harmed by the rain or any other water. But again, nope, they just came all this way with no preparation for this kind of situation, just so they could melt away into the gutter faster than they can say 'maybe we should have prepared for something like this...'This movie has too many problems to count, the characters are bland cardboard puppets, the story is driving in reverse, the climax is ridiculously simplistic and they went and admitted the film's fatal flaw right to the audience. If no one else picked up on this obvious plot hole the size of the Grand Canyon, then I must be going slightly mad. Yes Shyamalan is a great director, especially in previous films like the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, but those were psychological dramas rather than something more practical like an alien take over where a little more emotion and a little more practicality is involved. My advice to him is, go back to the stuff you were good at, the stuff that actually got you good reviews without having to butcher the whole plot and the film's feasibility whilst doing it.",2,4,7,20 July 2012
