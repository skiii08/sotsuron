War Dogs," Crazy way of making money - War Dogs
","The movie stands apart from the other recent releases and definitely is a must watch film, and delivers astounding performances by all the actors.On one hand, while it has a well drafted story, on the other hand, the screenplay and direction did their perfect job in rendering a masterpiece of movie.I mean, who believes that the US government invites bids from the normal people for their arms and ammunition requirement. This is one horrible thing that all the people should know about the Bush atrocious leadership.",8,6,10,9 November 2016
World War Z," Well, it's The Brad in a Zombie Flick!
","Obviously, very less people might have assumed that this could be a normal zombie flick, with lots of blood and gore in it, zombies with lost and dangling body parts, blood churning zombies or similar, whatsoever. Well, it ain't. This is an A-Class zombie movie.I couldn't expect much from such a blend of team. I can only read much criticism. But, it ain't a movie of that kind. You will definitely enjoy it, the whole off it, from beginning till the end. There are many scenes in the movie, which can bring you to the verge of the seat, highly tensed, and it carries the same emotion and tense till the end.And the only thing, that disappoints is the ending. Bcoz, I felt like, it could have been a little lengthier.You will definitely feel the same, unless you are some countryman, expecting some blood and gore or a chick flick!!!!!!!!!",8,3,11,26 June 2013
The Secret Life of Pets," At times boring, but gives an interesting ride all over!
","As the review title says, the film may make you feel bored at times, for the predictability and resemblances to other movies. However, the cute actions of the animated characters gives you and your kids a wonderful watch all through the film.One more disappointment with the movie is that there are several animated characters to watch out for, and each and every one speaks of its importance in the story.Nevertheless, the story will be engaging for you and keep your kids glued to the screens watching the amazing and sweet actions of the dogs and cats.",7,2,3,16 November 2016
Finding Dory," Its the same as Finding Nemo!
","Everything is same as in the prequel, Finding Nemo, except that you find more different characters this time with new places to look out for in the sea, and this time you can even spend more time on the land, than in the sea.However, it is the same kids detective story of finding the parents back and reuniting with them finally by the end of the movie. One more aspect that keeps your interest in the movie is that Dory suffers with memory loss, which marks for several twists all over the movie.So, it is a feel good movie with interesting elements to watch for and will keep you and your kids glued to the movie screen.",7,0,6,16 November 2016
Cloud Atlas," As David Mitchell says, 'a sort of pointillist mosaic'
","We have seen many movies in the past that deal with a plural number of stories (multiple story-lines) trying to prove a single point. In such movies that deal with different kinds of stories based on a singular point requires the best screenplay either in the novels or for the silver screen; to make sure an unbiased presentation prevails all over. Cloud Atlas is such movie containing six inter-woven stories trying to prove a single point, but are not based on a single point.The movie is made of opulent and dramatic scenes, that gives its viewers a spellbinding and, yet a realistic experience. We never feel confused for the intertwined stories, but the kind of storytelling brings us to the edge of the seat till the end of the cinema.The movie is special in its kind, for the stories in the movie are not based on a point but are interwoven and their relation in trying to prove a single point:'An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution.'Worth a watch for all the movie-goers, and definitely worth spending for the ticket. Relax and enjoy the one-of-a-kind storytelling.",8,0,1,7 January 2013
