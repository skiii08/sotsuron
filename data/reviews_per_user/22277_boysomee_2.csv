Sucker Punch," This movie is the most horrible thing I have ever seen
","I wish I could give this movie score 0 because it does not deserve even 1,most painfully idiotic movie you could possibly seen,story is beyond stupid,a total dissapointment,whoever did this is a piece of ****.",1,2,10,10 May 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," All I can say is that this movie is an abomination
","Its funny how this movie got such high rating when it deserves nothing,cliche jokes,cliche teenagers,everything cliche,the jokes are so lame and the way spiderman acts,total money grab from brainless teenagers,I miss the badass Spiderman Tobey Maguire,movies would have been so much better if he still was the spiderman not recycling the same thing over and over again and let it develop,BRING TOBEY MAGUIRE BACK AS SPIDERMAN,for me spiderman is a bad joke now.",1,4,10,12 May 2018
