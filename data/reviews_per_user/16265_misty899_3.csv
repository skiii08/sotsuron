It," meh...
","Ok. Disclaimer. Huge King fan. Seriously, i normally do not watch the books adapted to movies. I usually hate them. But my son really wanted to watch so... Here's a review. It's not bad. It's not great. It does follow the book in some aspects and ignores in others. If you haven't read the book, watch it. If you're a King fan, well, don't expect much. And, being brutal, Tim Curry as the original Pennywise is freaking fantastic. The other actor cannot compare or compete.",6,1,1,18 January 2018
Us," Good not great
","This movie being touted as the follow up by the director of Get Out, did not do this movie any favors. Excepectations were too high. Get Out is fantastic, but I think people judge too harshly expecting follow ups to be as good or better than past work. Then proceed to judge with one stars. Just look at M. Night Shyamalan. This is in no way a 1 star movie. Not even close by horror standards. It will keep your attention. There is some fun dark humor, gleeful gore, with a twisty ending. You end of liking/empathizing with characters (a skill only good horror movies have, making an audience relate and grow close to the main characters). The complaint I will agree with is that the doppelganger voice is ridiculously annoying. Seriously. We're not all just being picky by mentioning it. I dropped a star for that stupid voice. It was over the top and grating while adding nothing to the plot. Do I understand why it was that way? Yep. Still bloody annoying. This is worth a watch by horror afficianados. Kept my attention, didn't blow my socks off though. Good middle of the road horror/thriller movie. With a stupid voice.",6,3,4,3 December 2019
Tombstone," Just watch it
","Ok. Background. I'm a Sephora junkie girlie girl. And I love this movie. For me, this is an important caveat. This is not just a guy movie. It's ridiculously good and the 'I'm your huckleberry' scene is one I can watch over and over transfixed. Val Kilmer is that good. This is Val Kilmer at his best. Kurt Russell is phenomenal and tell me a movie that Sam Elliot sucked in. I dare you. Because he's awesome in everything. Guys ultimate movie? Yes. Women? Well, if they're not moronic vacuous creatures, yep, they'll love it. Or they should anyway.",9,5,7,5 July 2018
