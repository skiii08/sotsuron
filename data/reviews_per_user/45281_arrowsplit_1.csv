Ford v Ferrari," Suspicious About The Authenticity Of The High Ratings
","First of all, you expect a conflict between the two adversaries mentioned in the versus that happens to be the movie's title, right? Nope...Wrong. This movie is all about Ford and the struggle of creating GT40. All the conflict and drama awaits you in the Ford section. Ferrari name is like a clickbait in lame internet portals: 'You won't believe what Enzo Ferrari said when Henry Ford tried to buy Ferrari' :PWe literally see almost nothing from the Ferrari side. Well, I don't blame them for this cheap hoax because firstly I know from my very own experience that no one grew up with dreams of owning a Ford. We dreamed of Ferrari. Far fewer people would watch this movie if only the Ford name was mentioned in the title.Leaving this 'title nonsense' behind, I can confidently say that two of my favorite actors Damon and Bale have both presented decent but slightly poor performance compared to their average. Plot is weak and painfully predictible even if you haven't heard of a machine called 'car' before. In addition to that, unnecessary length gave me this crazy idea that if I would cut this movie into 3 second long pieces and reunite them in the order of 1-3-5-7 and 2-4-6-8, I would probably have 2 half length, almost identical movies without losing full version's essence. That would be my director's cut I guess. Long story short, you won't miss much if you don't watch it but if you like this specific genre, it wouldn't hurt to spare 2,5 hours of your time. I didn't hate the movie. It was just far behind what it offered with it's cast, 8+ star rating, fantastic reviews and so on.",4,3,9,17 February 2020
