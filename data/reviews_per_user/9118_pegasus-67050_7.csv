The Avengers," Perfect Superhero Movie!
","This movie is such a classic and remains a pinnacle for comic book cinema. It has drama, intensity, humour and sadness all packed into this film.The character interactions and banter are fantastic. So are the visual/sound effects and overall simple but effective plot.It is well acted, scripted and written in a way that can keep audiences of all ages and genders entertained for the entirety of the film.I think everyone has to give this film ago. It's a true classic. :D",10,0,1,26 February 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," AWESOME!!!

Avengers: Infinity War," Intense!
","This movie really has it all on a grandiose scale!
Emotion, struggle, humour and phenomenal team work shines in all the right places. In one such way this film is outstanding is in the character development. Mainly the relationships between: Thor & Loki, Thanos, Gamora & Nebula, Tony & PeterAnother place that this film excels at is the tension and intensity of the situation at hand aka Thanos and his army wreaking havok all over Earth and surrounding planets.We learn that Thanos' motivations are pretty intriguing and that he truly believes he's doing the right thing in his own mind despite his adopted daughters telling him otherwise. His long-saught, desperation leads him to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to gain all of the six infinity stones. Sacrificing his own adopted daughter. This scene was a heartwrencher and so was Loki's devastating demise. Other extremely tense situations were when Gamora begged Quill to end her life so that Thanos would be unable to obtain crucial information about where to and how to retrieve the remaining stones. Quill, in tears respected her wish despite being in love with her and shot. Only to have bubbles come out of the gun thanks to Thanos. The two were in devastation as their arranged plan did not work out.The ending battle was also full-on epic and emotional as various characters vanished into dust and Wanda had to kill the love of her life, Vision.This film is still a pinnacle of all superhero movies to date (alongside Endgame) and shall be respected well on into the future. :)",10,0,1,26 February 2020
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A classic, whacky and fun adventure for the whole family!
","This movie is a true classic. One you can watch over and over again and discover new things and never get bored! The story has good morals, the atmosphere is fun and there is good acting to top it off. Wonka is so wonderfully whacko yet likeable and all of the other characters are played well such as: Charlie, Mr & Mrs Bucket, Grandpa Joe and the parents of the feisty children. We even get a backstory of some of them such as Mr. Bucket, Willy Wonka and the Oompa Loompas and how he met them and got them to work for him in the grand Factroy.Each of the children are played on-point and they are all memorable in their own ways.Visually it's a wonderful treat and the catchy soundtrack by Mr. Elfman compliments everything onscreen so well.If you're looking for a movie that the whole family can enjoy, this one is it. Don't bother with the old, inferior version. This one has much more character to and varied atmosphere that will stay with you into your adulthood. I HIGHLY recommend everyone gives this movie a watch or FIVE. :D",10,0,2,2 June 2020

Thor: The Dark World," Visually lovely and continues off from the Avengers with some valuable character development
","This movie is certainly not on par with the first Thor film. It is still lovely however. The villain sucks but it's worth watching for Thor & Loki alone. Everyone else is pretty impactless except from Frigga and Heimdall. The acting isn't special apart from some memorable scenes with Thor, Frigga and Loki. Everyone else just doesn't leave an impression.Visually, Asgard is still stunning and is important to the plot of later MCU films (Endgame).The best part of this film in my opinion is Thor & Loki's interactions. Same with the other Thor movies but they also had extra content that actually meant something. I know this seems harsh but this movie is still one of the best fantasy/Thor/Loki/Warrior/Godly/Norse journeys out there!After Loki *dies*, the film is a lot more meaningless to me. He is easily one of the best parts of the film as he provides angst, laughs and some great interactions with his adoptive family. Even the other Asgardians (aka Thor's friends: Sif and the Warriors Three). He's the star of the film besides Thor obviously. Jane is much less interesting of a character than she was in Thor 1. She spent most of the movie possessed by the Aether (aka Reality Stone). Darcy and Erik are still true to their characters which is cool! We need some funner characters (No reason to mention the new 'intern.' He IS meaningless!) Don't get me wrong I love a darker, intense story sometimes (Infinity War/Endgame) but here Thor was extremely serious; To the point of being almost characterless. I love Thor. He was great in Thor 1, The Avengers and Ragnarok but here he was pretty boring. Nonetheless Loki was so cool in this movie as I already said, so at least he livened up the movie where it needed it most.Odin and Heimdall didn't do much except sit on the throne. At least Heimdall got a cool battle scene and helped Thor out of Asgard although it was forbidden by the Allfather. Frigga got a nice scene with Loki. One of the few since all of hi- most of his and Frigga's scenes were deleted :( even though they were *very* important to the plot of first Thor movie but at least those scenes are on the internet (YouTube). :/I didn't mention the soundtrack because in all honesty I don't remember it at ALL even though I've seen the movie at least five times. The soundtrack in Thor 1 was beautiful and emotional Even the Ragnarok soundtrack is more memorable than this film's one. I'm sure there is some nice music in this movie. It just doesn't - you guessed it, leave an impact.Overall a decent movie with good storytelling, amazing visuals and some awesome character interaction! :D",9,0,0,9 April 2020
Annihilation," Boring but Beautiful
","Very visually impressive but STRONGLY lacks in the story, characters & acting departmen. I used this movie as a '4K Demo' on my TV :P 
BORING! Had the potential to have more monsters and adventure but nope. Too odd for me.",1,2,6,16 September 2018
