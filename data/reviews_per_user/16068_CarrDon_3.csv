Iron Man 3," Don't let the trailers fool you!
","Okay,I checked out the long anticipated IRON Man 3 and I gotta be honest, I wasn't impressed! It started slow and then it only got slower! Because of the leisurely pace my movie partner crashed before half time!! I purchased 3D because everything else was sold out! It was seriously 3D at the beginning but became a regular movie early in, about ¾'s of the movie was not 3D. The story was Okay, **Spoiler** Mandarin wasn't even Mandarin! I give it a '6' and the Codec wasn't even worth wait'n for!....... I'm not surprised by Ironman 3's big box office opening. All the places and times I tried to get tickets to were sold out.My main issues are with (1) the slower than normal story line and (2)the scheme to use the Mandarin to pull in Ironman fans and (3) the high price for 20minutes of 3D!",3,2,4,6 May 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Here we go AGAIN!
","Let's talk about Edge of Tomorrow, another Excellent Movie! I think Tom Cruise has mastered the art of 'action and adventure' movies. **SPOILER ALERT** Tom Cruise's character continues to live, fight, die and then repeat throughout the entire movie, but you won't get bored because he eventually does different things that bring about different outcomes. As an actor he plays the same character in all his movies, but somehow it seems to work. This is a movie I would pay to see again and perhaps purchase, so I'm giving it an 8. The Little love scene in the movie was not even with the effort but the action was well worth it all, over all a pretty good movie! Not sure which summer movie to see next!",8,3,6,1 October 2014
The Martian," Okay, let's do the Math!
","Okay 'Let's do the math!' Mark Watney (Matt Damon), doesn't have enough food supply until the next voyage from Earth to Mars which is 4 years from now, or;, maybe, Let's see what's it like to be stranded on Mars until you're rescued? 'Hello Houston.. We got a movie!' If you liked the special effects in the movie 'Gravity' or the great science in 'Interstellar,' You'll love the movie 'The Martian.' It has Both and then some! I saw the Movie in 3D and I thought the Martian Landscape was Amazing! Matt Damon was great in his role as the stranded astronaut that works so hard with his brain and muscles to survive. If Damon doesn't get another Oscar for his role, Ridley Scott will definitely get one for best picture! (I give this flick an 8.5 out of 10)",8,3,20,5 October 2015
