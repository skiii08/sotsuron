Deja Vu," Brilliant
","The TV ads for this film fell way short. Had I known the awesome suspense sequences in Deja Vu I would have seen this in the theater instead of in my hotel room. Time travel is the least part of this performance -- it is the final answer--not the subject--not a science fiction film. Denzel can make any story real, but the dual present and past storyline is both original and riveting. The chase scene is absolutely fantastic! Best I've ever seen! One eye in the present and one in the past. Deja Vu belongs on the big screen. I'm mad about the previews. Space-folding is all I've heard. Deja Vu is a love/detective story. The technology is a well-done aside. Everyone will love this movie.",9,1,2,13 April 2007
