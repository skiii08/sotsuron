Skyfall," An Absolute Pleasure, Mr Bond.
","Just about the best 007 movie since On He Majesty's Secret Service, Skyfall also delivers on the promise Daniel Craig first showed in Casino Royale, but was squandered in Quantum of Solace. Here is a Bond with action to set your pulse racing from the off and a story that makes (almost) perfect sense. Beautifully photographed Roger Deakins and expertly directed by Sam Mendes no less, its great to see the copious talent involved in this long-delayed project has not been wasted. Javier Bardem is Bond villain in the classic mould and the gags are finally back but - and this is the thing - they're great gags (my personal favourite involves an old couple and a Tube train but you'll have your own). I saw it with an audience who cheered and applauded the climax. An absolute pleasure, Mr Bond.",9,17,42,26 October 2012
Shaun of the Dead," Deserving of accolades, but uneven.
","The thing is, 'Spaced' (the TV series from which this is closely derived) was perfect. Did I say that? Blimey, a perfect series. Wow. So this is not perfect because it occasionally looses it's way trying to balance it's heady blend of extreme horror, genuine drama and big 'ol fashioned belly laughs. That's a hard trick to pull off and 'Shaun' succeeds way more than it fails.In the red corner, Shaun (the magnificently louche Simon Pegg) and his mate agonise over which of his precious LP collection to spin at the zombies' heads while the undead loom over them. Very threatening (not). In the green corner, a really heavy scene in the pub where Shaun has to shoot his dear old mum in the head because she's copped a bite from a nasty. The latter is much more effective than the former and I can't help but think (director) Edgar Wright is really hankering to make this a full-on drama. He has all the tools.Anyway, see 'Shaun' because it's really good, much better than 28 Days Later.",Null,0,1,27 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Oh Dear
","Two films in and its now too late for Lucas's 'prequel' trilogy to be regarded as anything other than the greatest act of creative suicide in the modern cinema. No matter how good Episode 3 may be (and lets not kid ourselves, it stars Hayden Christiansen - is that his name?), there can be no doubt that these bloated, portentious, self-agrandising CGI cartoons have de-constructed the Lucas myth beyond redemption.The awful acting we expect, but Portman and Thingy make Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher look like Laurence Oliver and Vivian Leigh! If I live to be 101 I hope their mind-numbingly awful 'courtship' scenes never cross my glance again. There are words to accurately describe it that the rules of posting here do not allow.Like a lot of Star Wars fans old enough to remember the originals on the big screen, I tend to go back and see these films again. These are supposed to be the ultimate fantasy epics, the cheerleaders for modern escapism. This time, I went back to see if it really was as wooden and un-engaging as I'd first thought. George, you really have lost the plot. Lovely to look at yet empty at the core. We don't care about your worlds anymore, Peter Jackson has shown us the new way. Oh, and you owe me 12 quid.",8,0,1,15 January 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Marvellous Stuff
","Let me be honest here, I'm fully signed up to the 'Harry Potter is an irritating little git' brigade. But then, that's what hype does for you. No, I've never actually read one of the books at publication and, if I did (which is unlikely), it certainly wouldn't be in a breathless dash to the finish line along with 10 squillion others (usually to be found on tubes trains to work, on park benches or other public places as if to say 'Look! I'm reading the new Harry Potter!'). Harry Potter is great stuff but, please, keep it indoors people.So, having overcome my in-built inhibitions, what of this third Potter epic? This could well turn out as the best of a very impressive series. Visually stunning and brimming with inventiveness, this owes something to the weird and wonderful likes of the 'Singing Ringing Tree' and the warped vision of stop motion-master Jan Svankmeyer (Alice). Not the sort of thing one expects from a movie aimed at the average 14 year old. Its power to scare and thrill in equal measure is a tribute to director Cuaron and his team. So if you're still a Potter cynic, who can blame you. But if you love fantasy cinema, don't ignore this film",Null,0,1,6 February 2005
Quantum of Solace," Hey, its OK!
","Some observations (as Gareth Keenan would say)...Well, this is a decent movie but I'm not at all sure how it is 'by some margin' (according to Barbara Brocolli) the most expensive 007 movie made. I mean, for one thing it's a good 45 minutes shorter than the average Bond movie and for another, no major set-piece apart from the last one is actually *that* major. Oh sure, its all guns guns guns and lots of rapid cuts of Daniel Craig rolling around amid showers of broken glass but I'm still wondering...where da money go Boss? But then, this is Casino Royale part 2, and as such works quite well even if it feels more of an appendage or extra limb to Martin Campbell's superior entry. But it's still a bloody good action film. (over) edited to within an inch of it's life and replete with stunning stunts and thrills. Craig and Dench are almost a double act in this one - she seems to pop up all over the place as though second guessing his every move. Which is an amazingly generous use of her time considering he's just this new agent, just starting out, apparently...And yes, the plot is slight and feels under-developed but its not that different from any other Bond film. Basically, any film company that continues to employ two hacks like Neil Purves and Robert Wade (the literary genuius's behind 'The World Is Not Enough' and 'Die Another Day') gets what it pays for. Which is a damn shame because things started to look up a bit in 2006...But see this for film what it is - a lean and hungry return for the best Bond actor since Connery in a rather dull storyline. By no means the ball-drop the critics would have you believe but not the greatest either. A decent modern Bond film that keeps up in the air the ball 'Casino Royale' first kicked but doesn't exactly have any juggling tricks.",7,1,2,20 November 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Return To Form
","Actually, Pulp Fiction might be the 'better film'(tm) but this wonderful bit of celluloid has a different agenda - pure cinematic adrenaline. I saw this on the afternoon of it's first day's exclusive presentation run at the Empire Theatre in London. I wasn't intending to rush out and see it so soon but, hell, it's the new Tarantino isn't it? A good move, as it goes because this movie *seriously* rocks and I have no hesitation in recommending it to any fans of the grindhouse genre it celebrates. Sure, it's plotless but so are most of the movies I love now come I think about it. This, like those movies (2001, Apocalypse Now, Jaws) is concerned with the *experience* of cinema. CGI-obsessed studios take note - this is the real deal. Bravo Quenten -Jackie Brown is just a fading memory. We're all kids again, so enjoy.",Null,0,0,12 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Okay, but still an almighty mess
","This goes some way to redeem the gigantic steaming piles of CGI overload of the first two chapters. Not that this isn't another gigantic steaming (make that molten) pile of CGI overload but at least a semi-coherent plot kicks in at some point (about halfway through, unfortunately).But my God, what a lot of unnecessary shots of Corruscu...Corrisco...Corroscin...that city with all the little lines of spaceships in the sky. Come off it George, enough of all those gratuitous cartoon panoramas, have you learnt nothing from Peter Jackson? Oh well, no more chances left to remedy that one. The acting of Hayden Christwhydidtheycasthim is marginally less wooden than before but he does actually make a good fist of turning to the dark side. Unfortunately we still get some ludicrous lovey dovey stuff with Natalie WheredoIpickupmycheck. Are you doing this to taunt us because we hated AOTC so much George? Well, it worked, you taunted me you toad-necked old fool.What works in this one is the the mythology of it. Try as George does to derail the whole thing with wave upon wave of demented CGI overdrive, the 'birth' of Vadar and the Empire is compellingly rendered (so to speak) Yes, there are a few shivers when he is finally revealed. Unfortunately they get Hayden Twerp to wear the costume which makes him look like a puny little guy wearing a Vadar costume instead of the towering Sith of old (or new, whatever).So go see it and get the DVD and watch it collect dust like the other two. But it'll look nice on the shelf, eh George? Maybe someone should show him 'Sideways'...",Null,1,3,28 May 2005
