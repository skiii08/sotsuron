Moneyball," Good film about baseball and maths
",Baseball and maths are two of my interests so this was an enjoyable film to watch. It is the best performance by Jonah Hill that I have seen. The mix of the old footage in with the filmed parts works well. Also great to hear the song The Show sung,7,0,0,8 February 2020
Inside Out," Great concept from a film by Pixar
","Brilliant from Pixar as usual ðŸ˜Š many of the ideas are very relatable.
Great cast made up of people from the office and parks and recreation. Amy pouler is an excellent choice for joy",8,0,0,4 May 2020
Yesterday," Really nice film
","A very easy watchable typically English comedy by Richard Curtis. Some funny lines and a sweet storyline.
Ed Sheeran's cameo is a good one.",7,0,1,26 January 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," Great soundtrack
",Absolutely brilliant set of songs in this film. Real good throwback songs! Enjoyed seeing Chris Pratt in this. Could have been more story and less action,7,0,1,27 April 2020
Mother!," The worst film I've ever seen
","Everything about this was quite simply terrible. The camera work was so bad that I actually felt physically ill during and after watching the film. Due to this I spent occasional moments of the film staring at the emergency exit sign in the cinema just to try and not feel dizzy. I'm not even being over dramatic here, I've just never had a film make me feel so unwell before.Throughout the entire film literally nothing makes any sense and you think there must be some clever twist coming to explain it all - regrettably this never arrives. As it turned out both me and my sister wanted to leave the film throughout the majority of it but didn't do so because we both thought the other was enjoying it!Even if a 5 year old had written this story, it would be considered a poor effort. Had I know what the concept was then I would have gone to see such rubbish in the first place.Watching this was a complete waste of 2 hours of my life. Ultimately, I wish I had just gone and watched the bloody Reece Witherspoon movie that was out at the same time instead!",1,1,1,27 April 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Excellent film and very well acted
","This film is the perfect mix of funny and thoughtful. It highlights both the ridiculous nature of the Nazi regime as well as the very real sad consequences of it.
The two young actors who play the lead characters are fantastic. The character of Hitler is absolutely hilarious too and is played by the chap who made the film.
The Soundtrack is pretty good also with German version of classic pop songs.
All round very good film!",9,0,1,12 January 2020
