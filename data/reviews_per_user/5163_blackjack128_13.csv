Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," All Special effects, hardly any plot, but not bad
","Here it is, folks, the setup for 'Luke, I am your Father' It was great to have at least a few familiar characters, (although I definatly miss Han Solo, Luke and Princess Leia) The Lightsaber battles here were the most intense yet! And Anikan working with R2D2 to save the world, just like his son, Luke. boy, That Brings back Memories. I wonder if James Earl jones will be alive to Play Anikan when he actually becomes Darth Vader.",Null,0,1,12 August 2000
Ghost," stands the test of time
","sense comments are still being posted for this movie, more than ten years later, it's obvious that this movie stands the test of time.'Unchained Melody' is a great song, of coarse, and this one has a big spiritual impact for me: Life after death, Heaven and Hell, it does a good job with those issues. when I heard the title, 'ghost' I thought of a haunted house and dead trees and thunderstorms. you know, that sort of thing. but I was pleased that this movie proved to be quite differant. sure, it deals with a serious issue, but the comedy is always welcome. I did laugh during this movie, especially with Woopi Goldberg as the reluctant Oda Mea Brown. 'Ghost' is another classic that should have it's own special anniversery re-release.",Null,1,2,24 March 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," the weakest one of the trilogy
","this one lacked a certain edge that the other two had. not to mention that 'Luke, I Am Your Father' was a lot better than 'Leia's My sister!' that was just plain silly, not to mention as to how Leia reacted to that. was that the same Princess Leia that said classic lines like: 'I'd rather Kiss A Wookie!'? that was one of the wussiest displays of emotions I have ever seen. The Lightsaber Battles just weren't as intense as in Empire Strikes Back, and the death Star II.  Ha! Like we haven't seen THAT before, and those Ewoks! Man, what a dumb Idea! Living Teddy Bears? what Kind of Allies are that?",3,15,30,12 August 2000
Grease," Good Movie, Up to the very end (SPOILERS)
","This movie was O.K, not as dark or bleak as the Stage production (In the origional play, Rizzo really IS pregnant, and Frenchy never gets back into school)John Travolta did great as a punk, he filled the part nicely, and sandy.....I found it hard to believe that Olivia Newton John was 30 at the time of this movie! allthough THAT was more evidant with Hooker-Sandy at the end. That's right, Sandy turns punk and takes up smoking just to get a guy. pretty cowardly. discounting the ending, the rest of the film was great: a nostalgic look the the fifties, race cars, tail fins, and the songs were great, such as 'Tears on my pillow', 'Summer nights', 'rock n' roll is here to stay' and the memorable 'we go together'",Null,0,1,5 September 2000
The Mummy Returns," this can be viewed as a totally seperate movie, and not a sequel
","This Movie was awesome! I only saw it half an hour ago. this movie was exciting, emotional, and suspenseful. the sword play, the instince action, the love between the O'Connells was very realistic, and it adds a nice touch to the movie. I won't spoil the parts that show this,how ever. and the visuals were so cool on the big movie screen. I'd buy another ticket just for that.",10,0,0,23 May 2001
The Mummy Returns," woefully under-rated (A MAJOR SPOLIER!)
","After I saw this Movie, I was shocked to see all the bad reviews that it got, such as the sayings that it had 'bad acting' or 'shallow characters' and 'no plot'.I thought this movie was great! Easily the best movie I saw all summer! if you want shallow plots, watch 'Jurrasic Park III' which will give you 2 hours of people screaming and running from Dinosaurs.On the other hand, If you want a story with heart-pounding action, Romance, and suspense, and above all-emotion, than watch the Mummy Returns.This movie drew me in right from the start. for instance, I just love to hate anck-su-namun/meela, (SPOILER!!!) I felt for rick when he (temporarily) lost his wife, and I actually stood up and cheered at the ending.and second, I thought this Movie was MUCH better than the first. I Like how they advance the characters in this story, mainly with Ardeth Bay and Evelyn. Plus, the addition of the action will have your heart pounding! the first one did drag on a bit; in fact, the story didn't really pick up until halfway into the movie, and the ending was a little unsatifactory. Not the case here!so please. give this movie a chance and ingore all the complaints of 'bad acting' 'shallow characters' and 'no plot'. because i didn't find any of those flaws here.this was THE movie of summer 2001. no other movie even came close.",10,1,2,22 February 2002
Groundhog Day," *click* 'so put your little hand in mine....'
","That, is one of the funniest elements of this movie. possible spoliers-proceed with caution-My favorate parts are phil trying to commit suicide, driving over the cliff, jumping off the building, but every time-*click* 'so put your little hand in mine...' the funniest part, though, is him ending up in Jail, but cheering when when he wakes up at the inn again. Time Loop Storys are some of the best plots hollywood has ever come up with, if you liked this movie, i highly recommend 'Christmas Every Day'",Null,0,1,4 January 2001
Titanic," The ship sank. Get over it.
","This Movie was stunning, and yes it did move me, but the fact that all these people are pretty much dead by now anyway, marred the whole tragidy part, so I liked the Special Effects. They really did catch the realizm of it all, and They Did pull the old heartstrings with the mother singing her Kids to sleep while a quartet played 'Nearer My God to Thee', But I was in it for the intense Action: Miles of corridors filled with water, the Lights flickering out all at once, and the ship Breaking in half. that was cool",8,0,3,13 August 2000
The Lion King," My Favorate Disney Movie
","This Movie was My favorate because it was quite a contrast to other Disney Movies. the biggest contrast is that there is no Wussy Princess or 'fair young maiden' to rescue, and I like the lack of that plot here. the songs are unforgettable, being written By Elton John, the vivid animation, the moving storyline....after I saw this movie, for the next nine months, time just crawled by for that video to come out.",Null,0,0,12 August 2000
Shrek," funny movie, although a tad bit predictable
","This Movie was Hilarious. the obvious disney spoofs make it funny. it even spoofs a walt Disney World Attraction(see if you can guess what that is!) the problem was that whan I Found out why fiona doesn't like to be out after sunset, I saw the ending from a mile away. but anyway, the Ogres in this film don't really look that ugly, only the green skin lets you tell the differance(except for maybe the shape of the ears) but still, a funny movie",Null,0,0,26 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," 2nd best of the trilogy
","first seeing the movie, I thought it was just Blast this and blast that. It wasn't bad. after seeing the other two(ESB, RTOJ) I ranked this at second because there was no interesting twists like in Empire Strikes back(you know what I'm talking About), and Return Of the Jedi, which ranks three in the trilogy for me. in this one, Luke developed the school boy crush on Princess Leia, and I thought that was funny. it was long before that scene on the Bridge in return of the Jedi(BLLeeeechh!!)",7,1,2,12 August 2000
Tarzan," Hmmmm.....Haven't I seen this before?
","Hmmmm....haven't I seen this before? Ah yes. 'George of the jungle' George of the Jungle was ment to be a Comedy, with gags everywere! but while 'George of the Jungle' was a comedy, this one although it had basically the same plot, focased more on the emotional aspects of being orphaned in the jungle. if you ask me, Disney should of tried a differant plot, becauseThe Lion King was their best one dealing with emotional loss.if you like the plot of Tarzan, watch 'George of the Jungle'",Null,0,2,7 September 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Best one
","This one might of fallin short with the space battles, but it more than made up for that with the Lightsaber Battles and the plot twists(you now what I'm talking about) and the cliffhanger at the end was a great Idea. the best one.",9,0,0,12 August 2000
