50 First Dates," memory loss????
","Now, when I first saw this I thought it was absolutely brilliant, I could watch it every day for the rest of my life and never get bored. The idea was excellent, A man attempting to fall in love with a that loses her memory every night and apart from that it is HILARIOUS! It's just altogether a fabulous romantic comedy.Drew Barrymore was definitely the pest person to play the part of Lucy because I think that there's something really about her that allows you to see her character through her really well. Adam Sandler also played his role very well.The best part of the movie was the end as I'm sure all of you were thinking she was gonna get her memory back but... It didn't happen, did it but it is still my favourite movie.",10,0,0,21 May 2006
