Saturday Night Fever," One of the best films ever made
","Is the only reason this is not in the the top 250 films, snobbery? Its a film about disco, about a dumb teenage (19 year old) dancer, it was an enormous hit with pre-pubescent kids, it helped sell a lot of pop records. Its easy to dismiss and yet with each repeated watch it gets better and better. What is so great about it then? For starters John Travolta delivers the most physically exciting male lead acting role ever on screen. The dialogue is unrelentingly rough and dumb, perfectly matching the group of deadbeats that Travolta hangs out with. The editing is relentless allowing the viewer to get to know a lot about Travolta's character and background in as short as time possible. And of course it has the most exciting, intimate dance routines on film ever. It should surely sit among the top 50 best films ever made.",10,5,8,23 September 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Overblown
","I give this one out of ten to emphasise that I do not think this should be in the IMDb top 250. Undoubtedly it is an honest, somewhat rare and powerful attack on heroin, uppers and cocaine. The acting and pace are good too. What spoilt it for me was the special effects and sound effects constantly over laboured the horrors of drug withdrawal and the psychological impact it brought. As another person has commented I felt I was being bluntly manipulated into a situation where I would feel 'devastated' by the whole experience. Knowing that this was the case I consciously switched off from these bits. I have no objections to a film which leaves me emotionally whacked out, but I prefer it to be done in a more subtle way.",1,8,18,5 August 2006
Marie Antoinette," History brought alive
","A brilliant way to explain the history of this era to those who would not normally pick up a history book. Coppola may not have gone for absolute historical accuracy, but who really knows exactly what it was like back then? Coppola creates a character that we can relate to. Whether that is accurate or not is not the point. Once we sympathise with Marie-Antoinette then we can enter her world and start to imagine what it might have been like in Versailles in the 1700s. Yes it would have been good to have seen what life was like for the peasants in France then, but that would be a different story. On an entirely different note, loved the fact that Coppola puts all those great neglected post-punk records from 1978-81 onto the big screen where they belonged all along.",8,1,3,17 August 2007
Spice World," A wasted opportunity
","The point at which the world's love affair with the Spice Girls ended. Prior to this they got by on a mix of cheek, charm, enthusiasm and luck. Here they seemed to believe their own bulls**t. e.g 'We're big pop stars now, we can do anything. Acting, no problem' While they trained to sing and dance, they are clueless as actors. To be fair half of the blame lies with a script that appears to have undergone no re-writing and a TV director who has no feel for the big screen. Much of the locations are way too bland for what was then the world's hottest pop act. In fairness it was probably rushed because they had a tour/ album lined up. What should have been a laugh was one of the most excruciating 90 minutes I have spent at the cinema.",1,3,8,9 June 2007
"I, Tonya"," Tonya Harding's sweet revenge
","I am glad this film got made. I always smelled a rat in the media coverage of the Kerrigan/ Harding spat in 1994. Kerrigan was not so sweet and Harding not so nasty. Margot Robbie does a fair job as Harding and the staging of the big incident is well carried out. The film is ultimately not as powerful as it could be, as Robbie is too good looking, too magnificent looking. Harding was small, tough and put upon - we do not get that sense from seeing Robbie on screen. Also the mockumentary style falls flat in parts as the jokes are not funny enough; the cutesy girl/ dainty mum being foul mouthed is overused and never really as funny as the film thinks it is. The dialogue often meanders and is only pulled together by the use of the 70s early 80s rock tracks. Still very glad this film got made. Go girl, Tonya.",7,0,0,1 March 2018
Rush," Nicki Lauda's struggle and successes brought to life
","The full personalities of F1 racing drivers were never really revealed back in the 1970s. It was all about the vicarious thrills of speeding of the cars, crashes, shunts and the chequered flag. We saw the drivers spraying large bottles of champagne around, but we did not get to care what they were really like or much about the technique of racing. So the full enormity of Nicki Lauda's quick recovery from his burns to getting back into the driver's seat did not get properly examined at the time. Ron Howard's film redresses this by revealing the brilliant mind of Lauda, his crises, his struggles and his professionalism. It also, of course, shows the swashbuckling bravado of James Hunt and the glamour he brought to F1. The only criticism I would make was the film's budget could have been used to better bring alive some of the exotic locations, such as the final 1976 race off next to Mount Fuji, which heavily relies on computer graphics.",8,1,1,10 January 2014
A Hard Day's Night," Paul's grandfather
","The more you watch this wonderful film the more the significance of Paul's grandfather reveals itself. The 52 year old Wilfred Brambell - who was actually younger than Paul's father at this time - acts as a cipher for the louche behaviour afforded the Beatles through their fame. He is a womaniser, always up to mischief and an opportunist. His 'dirty old man' persona with his unshaven appearance is used to contrast their clean cut ebullience. The long running joke that he is 'very clean' is ironic, as he seems to play the role of fall guy to disguise their amphetamine driven, highly sexed life - a hint of which is given when John sniffs a coke bottle. The Beatles' excesses are no secret now, but it was in 1964. Their marketing was of four wholesome, clean blokes who you would invite home to meet the family, unlike Paul's grandfather!",9,0,0,10 October 2013
Sweet and Lowdown," Woody Allen's best since Stardust Memories
","I rate this Allen's most complete film since Stardust Memories. Though I know fans of Crimes and Misdemeanors and Hannah and Her Sisters would disagree. I think Allen has long since ceased to be a convincing foil for his scripts. I thought Sean Penn's performance along the other actress who plays the mute girl were among the best I have seen in an Allen film. Allen's updating of Fellini's La Strada as a theme was welcome too, I mean how could you expect Hollywood to get round to doing this? Allen you should stick to supporting roles in the future.",9,0,0,8 January 2001
Da 5 Bloods," Message papers over cracks
","Delroy Lindo is due an Oscar for his performance as Paul, the angriest of the 'Da 5 Bloods'. This means the film is much better than some of the low rankings I have seen on this site. Its strength is its allegory about black men who came of age in the 1960s and the lessons it can teach a younger generation. Paul (Lindo) has anger management issues and is ill-informed, of the three other Vietnam vets one takes opiods, one is a drunk and one a businessman who lost his fortune from spending foolishly. Spike Lee gives each of them redemption, but the redemption he offers Paul is off the charts, a truly moving scene (I think his name is a nod to St Paul). The film's weaknesses are well documented on this site; Lee suspends incredulity again and again with simplistic plot devices and cardboard cut-out side characters. But, Delroy Lindo (and Spike Lee's direction of him) saves the film.",6,0,0,25 June 2020
