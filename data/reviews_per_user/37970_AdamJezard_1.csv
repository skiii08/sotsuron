The Monuments Men," Give it a chance
","Reading the reviews of this made me feel as if I'd been in a completely different film from everyone else. This is not a bad film at all, but it is not a rip-roaring auctioneer for the brain dead either, thank goodness. It puts most modern action films to shame.Good ensemble cast, good story and I thought a decent script. Certainly not the catastrophe many others here say. Give it a go, it's worth watching. Reading the reviews, I can only think other people were seeking the boys' own heroics of Kelly's Heroes or The Guns of Navarone. If that's what you're expecting, you may well be disappointed, but if you're looking for something more sensitive and less fantastic, then this will do more than entertain.",8,2,4,11 March 2014
