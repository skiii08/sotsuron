The Avengers," Excellent with a few mistakes.
","Okay let me go off by saying this, I say this movie a when it came out and let the record show, wow this movie is wonderful some might say its, 'As good as it gets' Yes people of the world it is,(Quote on quote)'As good as it gets' and this is why: GOOD PARTS: This movie will defiantly keep you watching it with joy or what ever makes humans happy. This film is decent to watch with the family, a great one to watch with friends, and a superb one to watch by your self. It's high points include things such as: Explosions, innocent civilians dying with not even a last breath, hero's, villain's, okay dialogue, a big green man that isn't from space, thrills, aliens, Gweneth Paltrow, big flying whale things that qualify as, 'Aliens', a happy ending, PLOT TWIST, girls with tight outfits, (Wait make that girl with tight outfit) some sandwich that nobody has had before, FRICKEN IRON MAN, no Charlie Sheen, and the destruction of New York!(YEAH!) BAD PARTS: The director is seldom in my opinion he did some okay things, Buffy The Vampire Slayer and he has done some great things, Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog. But, for me a superhero movie is a little bit out of his league. This is the biggest thing, Monkey flipping Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow! I mean really Marvel/Disney/Who ever the heck picks people to star in block busters if you guys are just going to put in people that have you know what.(Wink, wink, nudge, nudge you know what I mean. You guys were practically drooling when you first saw her)If your going to put some one like Scarlet Johansson as a superhero then you should just put Rihhana in a movie about robotic Battle Ships, oh wait they all ready did! All I'm saying is that Kristin Wiig or Marion Cotillard would be a better Black Widow then Scarlet is. Any ways all in all this movie is great just put this on a ten disc blu ray set that is over priced and everyone will be happy. SIDE NOT: Cobie Smulders...",Null,4,10,29 June 2012
