Blade Runner 2049," Denis' Incredible Addition to the Blade Runner Universe
","Going into this film, like others around me, I was expecting an above average sequel given Denis' previous works and the golden, holy name that is Roger Deakins and his cinematography. What I was NOT prepared for was a slow and methodical, well thought- out, brusquely dystopian, beautiful, masterpiece of a film. Best of all, it stood on its own weight and did not lean on the success of the first, and more importantly, did not succumb to the obligatory setting up of future installments that so many franchises bow down to today. Many have stated their issue with pacing and plot weaknesses, but for myself, I would rather a calculated, philosophical, noir epic that the first Blade Runner did so exceptionally well. Then again, I have never been a fan of the Big Brosnan Bonds that quench the short attention spans of the star conservative reviewers, who obviously hold an unparalleled and acute taste in filmmaking. Could the run time have been cut down? Sure, but for such a small quip, it firmly stays in the shadow of the gargantuan amount of positives that I believe put this sequel above even the original. 10/10 A+",10,5,14,6 October 2017
