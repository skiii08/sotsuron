The Blair Witch Project," great!
","While using few traditional horror movie techniques, this movie is scarier than just about anything out there. Additionally, it has great-great-great performances not only from the three principles but all the small parts as well. Totally unlike any other movie I've ever seen.",10,1,2,17 July 1999
