Blade Runner 2049," Horrible Director
",As a fan of the original Blade Runner movie I was looking forward to this very much. The movie started out very slow and then got slower and slower. Visual effects were fantastic and had great detail. But instead of having a great sound track much of the movie seemed to be set to screeching sounds and dissonant chords. The movie had beautiful women and a lot of nudity but even that could not mitigate the outright boredom I felt while waiting for the next tedious scene. Only after the appearance of Harrison Ford's character did the movie pick up the pace somewhat. Too little too late. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I will remember the directors name and NEVER see anything he directs in the future.,1,14,28,17 October 2017
