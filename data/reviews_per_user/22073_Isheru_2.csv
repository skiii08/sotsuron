The Avengers," 'The Forbidden Fruit'
","This is exactly the joy that you will experience after watching this unforgettable remarkable piece of art dedicated to all the comic fans in the galaxy. Watching the movie is like having a guilty pleasure that is so sweet and addictive that keep you asking back for more. The Avengers has raised the standards so high that as fans we won't settle for any less than what we have just tasted. Direction, production, acting all were in my humble opinion deserve no less than two thumps up. Most of us entered the movie with high expectations And the avengers delivered that and more. Honestly speaking I didn't think that we will get to see the avengers in my life time. As a result I would like to dedicate my deepest gratitude on my behalf and on the behalf of all fans out there to every single man and woman who made this fan service comes to life.",10,1,5,4 May 2012
Sicario," worst movie of the year
",am crazy about movies and mostly i got through reviews especially users reviews to decide if am gona watch the movie or not. This time they gave the movie a very high rating which encouraged me to watch it. To all the movie fans out there ... The first hour of the movie i saw lots of ppl leaving the theater and cant blame them the movie is so slow that you feel your suffocating and makes you feel like shouting saying 'comooon give us something' more ppl started leaving but i remained waiting for a twist or a turn of events that can make this movie passable or worh the ticket. the movie ended and i was like ... Thats it ?! Wow i need to write a review about this so that others be aware. This movie is by far the worst movie of the year,2,21,50,24 September 2015
