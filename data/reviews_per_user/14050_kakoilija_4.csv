Marie Antoinette," not worth your time
","the points are from amazing cinematography, costumes, and scenery.besides that i could not tell anything positive about this movie.i like historical documentaries...but this was like 21th century people put in that time...comedy was lame...boring...and the rock... wtf what was up with that? some points were like a teen-shopping movie, while other parts were like boring drama.complete waste of time. i've seen a lot of worse movies, but this one is totally missable, crap,...shame on coppola!",4,2,2,3 February 2008
Nacho Libre," uh oh...
","I'm a Darwinist. I don't like Jesus crap.This was a wannabe happy movie for christians.It did not display, any of the Mexican angst...Hated every second.I had to watch this with a girl who was giggling...so I didn't tell her how I felt really.LORD ITS NOT REALLY CHEEZE BUT IT TASTES LIKE IT =D=D=D=D=D=DDO NOT WATCH THIS IF YOU RESPECT YOURSELF. DO WATCH IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE MORONS... who doesn't like individualism, and want to conform lies, ... sorry christians there's no god no matter how funny you make the movie =D (read for example little R. Dawkins books etc). Not funny...AVOID! POINTLESS! NOT FUNNY! Watch Happiness or Human Nature... those are really good comedy.",2,3,6,9 February 2008
District 9," Not a great Sci-fi movie or I'm getting old!
","I went to the movie to be entertained. However came out quite irritated.Irritation was due to the fact that movie seemed very ignorant, as it tried to be somewhat intellectual? I have studied African matters in great extent, and I found that the movie was just playing on the stereotypes from there. Like the Nigerians, who are blamed for everything in South Africa (even though most migrants are not even from Nigeria). There are hundreds of big crime syndicates in South Africa that are very violent, but they are not all Nigerian.Then what I found irritating was the fact these beings were altruistic? So human, even when they come from a completely different planet. I like real movies, but this was made for ignorant people playing on their stereotypical thinking, and little added glory and goodness for the viewer... happy endings make better bucks I read from a Hollywood marketing book.I just found the fact that movies that simulate suffering, and displacement of people due to conflicts and hunger are the only ways that people can somewhat even see the real problems. This movie is testimony to the ignorance of the general public on almost all matters... reality is so terrible that people cannot face that. It could also be that I'm getting old, and too aware of reality.1 point for good looking RED ONE material 2 points for good Violence 1 point for good CGI + lots of tracking",4,27,54,29 August 2009
Zombieland," Boring, but nice compositing!
","Compositing, and effects are good... The movie was like home-alone =D as stupid and as funny...I really don't know what write more. Phantom shot slo-mo in the beginning were cool...The script was maeby more for the average person who sees one movie or two a month... but yes I wouldn't recommend this for the horror-fans... nor anybody who likes sick movies, this ain't even close, boring...OK did I already get my 10 lines? Well I guess if you are hangover then this movie is OK to watch... smoke a little weed maeby then it is watchable? No boring maeby... oh lord I payed money to see this...",3,6,13,24 November 2009
