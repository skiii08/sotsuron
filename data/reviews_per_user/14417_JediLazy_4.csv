Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't Listen to Critics
","I really don't know what's up with all this negative vibe about this movie. People don't appreciate a MASTERPIECE anymore.  This movie was the BEST movie I have ever seen!  I don't understand how anyone can say anything negative about this movie.I don't even know where to start telling you how great this movie is.Lets start with CGI's that were beyond any others I have ever seen Lucas's company has done work for this movie that will up the standards for ALL movies after this.  No doubt about it.  The graphics are BEAUTIFUL.Next the story wasn't a big part of the movie but, if you're a StarWars fan and watched Episodes 4,5,6 then this movie would make a lot more sense.  I just love to see how the Jedi council has formed.  I thought it was very informational.Let's see.  What's next?  OH I KNOW.  The costumes of this movie were just perfect.  George Lucas was trying to bring a more brighter and a more elegant than Episodes 4,5,6 because just like in the 1800's the dresses and suits were more colorful and shall I say again elegant.!NOW THE BEST PART!Without a doubt the thing that makes this the best movie (besides that I am a Loyal StarWars fan) is the choreographed fight scenes.  These are the best sword fighting I have EVER seen.  I know everyone has to agree with that.  I haven't even seen this type of sword fighting in old Kungfu movies.One more thing I almost forgot.  There isn't a better villain then Darth Maul(Ray Park).  The look of Darth Maul just gives me the chills.This is one hell of a movie.  Go see it, and if you don't then you are missing a MASTERPIECE.-----10",10,0,0,2 August 1999
Reservoir Dogs," One of my personal favorites
",Reservior Dogs is Quentin Tarantino's best movie.  The way the movie just keeps flowing makes it great.  The dialog which is Quentin's strong point is great.  It even had me fooled when I found out who was the cop.  This movie is a masterpiece and goes into my best movie list.  I gave this movie a 10. Because its almost at the top of my list.,10,0,2,13 July 1999
Pulp Fiction," Great Movie by Quentin Tarantino
","I can tell you right now not everyone will like this movie. Especially critics, but I personally thought it was brilliant directing.  It was a great idea to put the movie in different order.  This then makes you pay more attention than most movies. Also what I loved and always love about Quentin Tarantino movies is the dialog.  The way a character talks helps me understand the character more which makes the movie easier to understand. Last but not least, its the little things that get me to like a movie. Like the code for the briefcase which is 666, and the bandaid on the back of Marsellus Wallace(Ving Rhames) neck. Now how did that happen.  Overall I gave this movie an 8.  I always thought Quentin Tarantino would make great movies.",9,0,0,13 July 1999
The Truman Show," A great movie for Jim Carrey
",The Truman Show is another one of my personal favorites.  This movie will probably disappoint people if you think its an all out comedy like all of Jim's movies.  But it's not.  In fact I think its way better.  Jim definitely shows his acting abilities as a persona other than comedy.  The idea of this movie is just extraordinary.  And the climax and resolution of this dramatic movie is wounderful.  I gave The Truman Show a 10.  This movie will surely give Jim Carrey a future in more wide variety movies besides comedy.,10,0,0,13 July 1999
