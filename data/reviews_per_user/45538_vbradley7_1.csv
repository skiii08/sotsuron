Hereditary," Missed opportunity
","This film had such potential and the first half was exciting, scary, thrilling and absorbing. Then it felt like they had no idea where the story was going and made it up as they went along. No explanations or reasoning given just a very disappointing lack lustre ending.",6,0,2,21 June 2018
