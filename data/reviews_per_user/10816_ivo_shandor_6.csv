Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Lots of holes in the ship...
","I love the Pirates of the Caribbean films, all three of them, though I occasionally notice the holes in them, and though they are not perfect, they're still a lot of fun in the good ol' classic adventure style. On Stranger Tides is maybe the weakest of the films. Ian McShane is great at Blackbeard, his look is great, but Blackbeard was notorious for killing anyone simply because he could. He only kills maybe 2 or 3 people in this movie. Bruckheimer states he's the most evil character we've ever given you, not true, he hangs sailors upside down, he does burn a guy, but that's it. Disney is afraid to be too scary or villainous even though Shan Yu in Mulan killed an entire village and they prove it. Disney is simply afraid to have villains be too evil. You can't have that for your film, it really downplays it.At the end of the film, Philip and Syrena kiss and she drags him underwater...and that's it...they don't explain what happened to them or how he's able to breathe or anything. Also I don't think we cared for the fact that mermaids are actually underwater vampires. I though it was cool that the mermaids kill sailors, but that they turn into beasts seemed silly.I didn't care for the opening of the man lost on the raft and then we're in Spain, with the rain, lying mainly on the plain. We want an opening with our favorite characters, something like the opening to Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Trek Into Darkness, where we catch Jack on an adventure that has nothing to do with the main one in the movie, this happens in every Indy film.The cast is good, I don't have anything against Geoffrey Rush, he's my favorite character. Depp is always good as Jack.That whole scene where they have to jump into the river is the worst scene in the movie. They drag out this scene for longer than absolutely necessary. We know hoe the scene is going to end; he jumps in regardless of how long you drag it out and he lives, the main character always lives through those jumps. Why are they dragging the scene out when we know what's going to happen already? They always survive the jump in adventure films, let's move on, why are they so worried he's gonna die? This is treating your audience like they haven't seen this kind of film before, insulting their intelligence.There is not one cannon shot in the movie, only sword fights and pistols, which are cool, but still, no cannon fire which is one of the most exciting elements of pirate films.The locations are great, classic adventure sets, good action scenes, like the sword fight between Jack and Angelica, I like the opening scenes, especially when Jack is caught in London. There's a good chase scene then and I like how Barbossa is on the same chase as Jack.There's some good scenes, again but some stuff falls flat, even the end, which is essentially the ending of Last Crusade.",4,1,1,31 May 2013
Iron Man 3," One of the biggest disappointments...
","I'll say this...this movie has two good action scenes...and that's it. Iron Man 3 has one of the worst twists for a comic book movie. Turns out the Mandarin isn't the Mandarin, he's an actor pretending to be the head of a terrorist group. I'm surprised more people aren't mad about this. This is blatant false advertising. We were promised the climax of Iron Man vs. Mandarin, instead we get a mad scientist who breathes fire. Our main villain breathes fire...that's the worst comic cliché you could have, especially for a movie...didn't we stop with powers like that in the 50s? I was really let down by this movie. The main villain isn't supposed to be a robot, clone or hologram. Hey guys, guess what, Darth Vader was actually just a hologram built by the Emperor...or wait, Dr. Doom was actually an alien in a body like in Men In Black? That is the dumbest idea for a villain ever conceived, and this isn't the first blatant attempt. That's just insulting our intelligence.Also, you're telling me the group in the first movie have no leader, they're just some guys in the desert with no purpose in the span of three films? Has anyone noticed the trend of 'villains with a twist' in movies nowadays? In Prometheus, Guy Pearce appears as Weyland, and no one cared he was there, and then no one cared when they revealed his daughter, for no apparent reason, and then no one cared when he died. Dark Knight Rises, Talia al Ghul, who everyone say coming, appears in the last 20 minutes of the movie, basically as a 'oh and by the way, I'm the villain.' Bane, who according to the trailers, we were promised was the villain, turns out is not the mastermind we were all promised, but a sideshow character and lovesick puppy dog taking orders... Plus Bane is killed off in the most anti-climactic way possible. Same thing happened with Mandarin in Iron Man 3.Mandarin is revealed to be an actor, when according to the trailers, we were all promised the fight between Stark and the Mandarin....way to false advertise Marvel. We had false advertising for two main villains in blockbuster movies. I'm surprised more people aren't outraged at these filmmakers who think they're trying to be clever. Their work comes off as jumbled and disrespectful to the source material, plus they don't hesitate to insult your intelligence. Joseph Gordon Levitt also comments about chasing large alligators in the sewers in the third movie. This is Nolan making fun of Batman and Killer Croc...Nolan thinks Batman and Superman should be realistic...these are comic book characters...what makes them so fascinating is that they are not realistic.Villains aren't supposed to be revealed as a clone, or robot, or android, or someone from the future, it's a cliché that give comics a bad rap. Villains should be an imposing threat to the hero.",5,10,21,30 May 2013
Man of Steel," No Superman here...
","Live action filmmakers apparently don't know anything about Superman. I should warn you, I think the best Superman adaptation has been in animation, especially the animated series of the 90s with Tim Daly as Superman. Superman is always the boy scout, the Captain America of the DC Universe, honest, noble, brave and true. This is not the case in Man of Steel. The filmmakers were confused by Nolan. Nolan created a realistic and dark, brooding Batman series. Here is the problem. Batman is not realistic. And neither is Superman. You can't make Superman a dark, brooding individual who's confused about who he is.The worst line in the movie is when Pa Kent says, 'You should've let the boy die.' He is referring to when young Clark rescues a bus full of children. Pa Kent would never, ever in a million years, say anything like this. Pa Kent is the same as Superman, honest, noble brave and true, a small-time farmer who has the simplest and heartfelt take on life. He just said you should've let people die...wrong. Superman is not like Batman, you can't turn him into a dark character, because that's not who he is. Nolan for some reason became the Joss Whedon of Marvel. Simply because Nolan had a hit with Batman, doesn't mean he should sheperd all upcoming DC films.Whedon gets the game; he knows the characters and has even written quite a few comics. Nolan is a one note filmmaker, and he's not the best person to oversee DC. Also, Nolan is overpraised as a director, I say. Onto Zack Snyder, one of the worst filmmakers today. Snyder has no directing style. He simply thinks if he puts in an absurd amount of slow motion, that it will turn into gold. That's not how filmmaking works. Warner Bros. simply hired him because he was cheap and he made a cheap Superman. Warner Bros. clearly hired the wrong man for the job. Duncan Jones was even in the run, a far more visual and stylistic filmmaker than Snyder.Snyder thinks that if he puts it in slow motion, it's cool. Wrong, the Wachowskis only put slow motion in the Matrix when it worked, not the whole movie. Snyder overuses a zoom in shot 5 times simply because he's not a stylistic filmmaker. It's the same shot Abrmas used in STar Trek, when they're space jumping to the drill in the first film, and then the Vengeance is falling through the atmosphere to San Francisco. Snyder merely saw other better films, and decided to rip them off, saying 'hey that scene is cool and better than mine, maybe I'll out in there.' Man of Steel is like a stupid combination of Transformers and JJ Abrams' Star Trek series. When Superman is battling the earth eating device, for no reason, Transformers Michael Bay tentacles suddenly come out and start attacking him. Okay....Also, Zod is defeated by a black hole device, sound familiar Embassador Spock? Its embarrassing that the first 20 minutes of the film on Krypton rip off Avatar, another terrible film. The filmmakers even got Krypton wrong. Krypton is supposed to be a paradise planet, no war, no disease, like the Amazon. Instead, Krypton is a sterile and cold, wasteland like planet, and you don't really feel sorry for seeing it blow up. Even Zod is left something to be desired. Shannon is rather William Shatner hammy as the villain. Zod should have been more like Khan, from Star Trek Into Darkness. Zod doesn't need armor, just needing a simple motivation for revenge would be fine for him. Killing Jor-El was also a mistake, yeah spoilers, he kills Jor-El, with immediately killed for me the hope of seeing his revenge story. Zod's costume should have been more like Khan's in Into Darkness, and funny enough, that's what other versions of his costume looked like.Perry White doesn't do anything in the film, not one thing, he's just there because he's Perry White. Lois Lane also doesn't do anything, she's simple there because she's Lois Lane and her primary role in the film is to be rescued by Superman. Wow, you just destroyed the character of Lois Lane already. She's supposed to be a tough, self reliant and powerful leading lady for Superman. In this she's taken into a secret military base studying aliens and taken onto the secret military jet to destroy Zod's world eating device, then Zod takes her onto his ship...for no reason at all, simply because she's Lois Lane. Reporters would never be allowed to see these things. Her only role in the film is to be saved by Superman.The nail in the coffin is the end fight with Superman and Zod. Spoilers, Metropolis is completely destroyed, knocking over 50 skyscrapers in their fight in the process, killing thousands. Superman and Zod are locked in a death grip, Zod about to use his heat vision to kill 4 innocent people. Superman in an attempt to save them...breaks Zod's neck. Thousands of people are already dead and you're worried about 4 people? Superman would never cause such violent destruction, he would always put out fires, do everything to keep buildings from falling, vowing never to let go, lest he gets someone hurt, he even said this in the final episode of the Justice League series in his fight against Darkseid.Superman finds a ship that contains his suit and Jor-El's memories. Yeah, spoilers, no one designs his suit, not his mother or father, he simply finds it in a ship. Why was it there? Who used it before? Are you implying that 1000 years ago when the ships landed, they knew a Superman would be there? Are you implying someone was Superman before Superman? That really kills your whole, you're unique Clark theme in the movie...Superman simply finds his suit, which I thought was a laughable plot device, ruining Superman's back story. Watch the animated Superman instead.",1,71,136,16 July 2013
Hero," One of the worst films ever made....
","Why is this rated 8 out of 10 stars? This is one of the worst, one of the most boring films in the history of cinema, a movie that dares to call itself a motion picture...I don't care about any of those Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon type film...why are they popular? Because people can jump and do stupid stunts like run on wind? These are some of the worst films ever made, the stunts are laughable and they serve no purpose whatsoever. Just because a movie has stunts and people can fly, for no explained reason, doesn't make it a good movie. This is a travesty. This movie has absolutely no plot. No plot...I don't care if people say there is one, I lost track of everything in the first 5 minutes. This film was 3 hours long, time I will never get back, a huge waste of time, money and I pity anyone who went to see it. This is one of the most forgettable films in the history of cinema..seriously I can't remember anything about this film...it has no redeeming quality. No plot, laughably bad acting, and boring as hell. A travesty this is rated 8 out of 10.",2,0,6,30 March 2012
Clash of the Titans," Absolute garbage
","Disney has a much more accurate movie than these people. There is so much wrong with this movie: 1. The opening credits dictate that the Kraken killed the Titans....really?....a water creature from Norse mythology, not Greek, why they bothered with it at all....destroyed the Titans of Earth, Water, Fire and Air.....how does that work? These people obviously never read Greek mythology. 2. Hades is the villain: wow, what a big surprise, and let's get Ralph Fienes to not act, let's have him talk like he smoked 80,000 cigarettes. 3. The original had a more convincing villain and a surprising villain, watch it. 4. The original was a love story, this one is just a dumb revenge tail, because certainly people don't want human characters, they want mindless action and characters who have no plot or purpose. 5. The people in the desert are called gyn, Arabic for genie. Why is Arabic mythology in here now? Perseus should have wished to get out of the movie. 6. Why does the Kraken take the whole movie to appear when in the original, he appeared in less than 5 minutes...twice...? 7. Why is Medusa played by a supermodel in this, when in Greek mythology, remember that?, she was cursed with ugliness? 8. Did anyone else notice that the middle eastern guy blew himself up? Think about it, won't you? 9. Sam Worthington can't act. 10. No one in this film can act. 11. There is an alternate ending where Perseus destroys all the statues on Mt. Olympus. Wow, our main character just killed every living person in the world, because that's what heroes do, right? What a dick. 12. What purpose does Andromeda have in the story at all, and frankly why is she in the sequel? 13. Worst possible 3D ever invented. Let's waste money like hacks like George Lucas and James Cameron. I had a science fair project back in high school that had more convincing 3D. 14. The original is still 10 times better than this thing that dares call itself a motion picture. 15. They said that the Kraken is a piece of Hades....how does Hades the ruler of darkness and the underworld create a water monster with his skin? 16. According to real mythology, why does Hades always hate being in the underworld? He's got all the word's riches, Persephone, and all the souls he wants....why does he always hate his job?Ray Harryhousen does better special effects than most people do nowadays. That's how far our technology has gone, we have actually downgraded technology to the point where a flying Mary Poppins is more convincing than a giant Godzilla monster reject.",1,3,4,8 March 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Toss it into the dark side of the moon...
","This movie isn't very good either. The opening is just hilarious because NASA automatically thinks that the ship crashing is a UFO? How do they know that? What if it's a meteor? Did you read the script ahead of time? Shia is also one of the most annoying actors working today. He's a stuttering annoying teenager in every movie. That's not acting...He has the worst scene in the movie, when his car is smashed, he starts screaming at the top of his lungs. It's the single most annoying moment I've ever seen in a movie. Another scene is when John Turturro and his assistant are in the Russian bar and then they have a Mexican standoff for no reason, only because Michael Bay uses it in all his films. Turturro then speaks the worst fake accent I've ever heard in a movie. It's just embarrassing on the astounding level of filmmaking of Michael Bay, pre-school humor and explosions.The level of stupidity in this movie astounds me. First off, how did the Russians get ahold of Transformer technology? They never got to the moon. Did the Americans just give it to them? This was the Cold War, that would never happen.We were tricked with this movie as well...We were told the main villain would be Shockwave. Lie...Megatron is the semi-villain while Sentinel Prime is the villain. That's another false advertisement for the movie. Shockwave only has one line in the movie...one line...and he's defeated by a parachute...a 10-foot tall robot is defeated by a sheet...embarrassing.Optimus Prime in the end, throws an axe into Megatron's face and then kills him. Prime would never do that, it destroys his character as a moral leader, never killing his main enemy. And he does it for no apparent reason, only Bay killing the franchise.There is only one good scene in the movie, when the building collapses. Bay's sense of humor is just dirt level, unintelligent and he just shoves as much stuff on screen as possible.",1,5,8,2 June 2013
