The Blair Witch Project," America's dumbest home videos
","A - I knew very little about this film before seeing it. It didn't help, I still don't like it.B - I do get it, I just wish that I didn't.C - If this film only cost $30,000 to make, they must have spent $28,000 of it on beer and pizza.D - The most frightening thing about this movie is the fact that I shelled out six bucks to see it (I won't count the popcorn, I was hungry anyway).E - If I ever see this film again, I'll have to be a prisoner of war undergoing psychological torture.F - The person who thought this idea up is the greatest marketing genius since the guy who invented the pet rock.G - If you enjoyed this mess then I have several hours of home movies you would likely consider a masterpiece of modern cinema.H - I never thought I'd see a film worse than 'Eraserhead'. I was wrong.",1,5,11,10 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better the second time
","I learned some time ago to discount most of the hype surrounding highly anticipated films, and just try to take them as I see them. As a result, I thoroughly enjoyed The Phantom Menace. O.K, maybe it seemed just a bit too 'kiddified' and some of the little plot twists were rather contrived. As well, none of the characters had the screen presence of a Han Solo or A Princess Leia. But on the whole it was a pretty good film. It did not lack a plot as a number of other folks have claimed, but in my opinion had no more nor less plot than any of the other films in the series. Try and keep in mind that this is ONLY Star Wars, not Shakespeare in space. It's really only supposed to be fun and entertaining, not a life changing experience. The simplest and most basic endorsement I can give is to say that I've seen it twice, enjoyed it more the second time, and look forward to my next viewing.",Null,0,0,28 June 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Flaws are not worth mentioning
","I was feeling weary from the constant barrage of action flicks, teen comedies and generally mindless drivel that you must endure as the 'Coming Attractions' whizz past your eyes every time you enter a theatre. Five minutes into SIL, all memory of those images were completely driven from my mind and replaced by the best screenplay I've encountered in a long, long time.This is not a perfect film. It doesn't matter. Any criticism that I could come up with would only feel like nit-picking at best. This is the sort of film that you encounter only once in a long while and renews your faith in the movie industries ability to make something truly wonderful. I had been quietly rooting for Saving Private Ryan to dominate the Oscars this year. Now, I must change my mind.",10,0,0,20 January 1999
Elizabeth," 'Tonight we settle all the royal business'
","I'm a fan of costume dramas, so I was only mildly disapointed with Elizabeth. I found the dark period candle/torch lighting to be pleasingly realistic (much more realistic than the historically innacurate plot). Generally, the acting was pretty competent, highlighted by the performances of Blanchet and especially Rush. Strangely, I found Joseph Fiennes a little miscast in his role, though I thought him superb in Shakespeare in Love. Without the benefit of reading the other comments on this site first, I was reminded a great deal of The Godfather during the scenes of rounding up and punishing the conspirators. As costume dramas go, I almost prefer 'Lady Jane', an equally historically inaccurate film that just seemed to come together a bit more cohesively and provide a bit more compelling story while being somewhat more entertaining. Still, I suppose it's a great deal better than most of the other dross on offer most of the time.",Null,0,0,9 March 1999
54," Nostalgia isn't what it used to be
","I agree with those who call this a poor imitation of Boogie Nights. It's not that it was all that bad, it just isn't that good. It's like the cream of wheat of movies. Fills your stomach up when you're hungry but fails to excite. Mediocre acting (Mike Meyers was OK), mediocre script, and mediocre plot. It could have done a much better job of conveying the shallow tackyness of disco culture, given that it was focused on the capital city. Just a whole lot of wasted potential.",Null,2,4,22 March 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Only great films are this hard to pin down.
","This is a monumental film. As proof of that claim, I offer two points to ponder. Firstly, look at the number of user comments on this site. Few other films contained herein have inspired such a reaction (good or bad, it makes no difference). People simply do not take the time or effort to make so many comments on a film of minor importance. Secondly, the comments made represent just about every opinion and point of view conceivable. Many movies on this site are referred to as both the best and worst films ever made by the people who send in their comments. Usually, those opinions display a number of recurring themes and tend to form a pattern. Not so for SPR. The comments I've read run the full spectrum of criticisms, some of them highly contradictory. Only a truly monumental film can garner this type and degree of reaction, and draw such a diverse response from so many. Some of the greatest films ever made have continued to be controversial for long periods after their release. '2001:A Space Oddysey' is a good example. It's still loved, hated and misunderstood by hordes of people. Love SPR or hate it, it appears to bear the same stamp of indefinability.",Null,0,0,1 February 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," The most intellectually challenging film of them all.
","Calling 2001 the best film of all time is a distinct possibility, but calling it my favourite film of all time is a dead certainty. No other film before or since has had the effect on me that it has.Firstly, I have to say to those who find it pointless or confusing that it does indeed have a point and makes perfect sense once you discover it's meaning. For me, this took over 20 years and a great deal of thought and life experience (and a fair amount of reading). Don't have the time or the inclination? Stick to Star Wars (an enjoyable but totally different kind of film).I was only ten when I saw this film for the first time. Did I understand more than 20% of it? No. Did I wish to? Passionately. I'd go so far as to say that a desire to understand this movie played a significant role in the direction of my intellectual development. That's a heck of a lot to attribute to a single film, but I'll stick to this assertion nevertheless.I still experience a feeling of awe and wonderment every time I re-visit 2001, even though I now feel that I pretty much understand the film. Partly, I suppose this is a recollection of my first viewing as a child when I understood little of it, partly the debt of gratitude that I owe to the mental journey I undertook to finally 'Get it'. If anything, It has more of an  emotional impact on me now in my understanding than ever before.I'm also the only person that I know who feels this way about it, so if you don't 'get it', don't feel badly. You aren't alone. If you feel the same way about, then we share a bond.",10,0,2,24 January 1999
Mission: Impossible," Entertaining but ticked me off
","This was an entertaining film. OK, the stunts may have been a little implausible (most movie stunts are anyway) and it may have deviated significantly from the ensemble nature of the series, but I thought that it stood up well on its own as a spy film. Some found it too difficult to follow, but to me that kind of challenge makes for interesting viewing.What really ticked me off was the treatment of the Jim Phelps character (I guess the film's been out long enough to reveal that they made him the bad guy). This simply wasn't nessesary. Not only did they make the good guy of the old series the villain of the movie, they made him a particularly vile and nasty one. This is a bit like having Batman team up with the Joker or James Bond decide to go for the bucks and to hell with the rest of the world. Although I enjoyed the movie, I will always hold a bit of a grudge against it for such a lapse of good judgement.",Null,3,4,19 January 1999
A Clockwork Orange," Prophetic, challenging and a pleasure to the eye
","Clockwork Orange is a prime example of why Kubrick is considered one of the best directors ever (my own personal favourite). Having said this, it's definitely not for everyone. Although not terribly graphic by today's standards, it has a psychological potency matched by few films since. There is also a rather prophetic feel to it in its view of future (now present) gang violence that some may find a little too close to the mark to be comfortable with.Like most Kubrick films, CWO is an intellectually challenging film that leaves the audience feeling a sense of puzzlement as to the meaning of many of its elements. If you only enjoy movies that play down to your level, you will not enjoy it. However, if you like to be challenged to reach upward a little and struggle a bit, even long after the closing credits, you will find it a treat.Artistically, it has a great deal of that Kubrick style that leaves the viewer with the same feeling that you get after listening to a great piece of music or studying a fine painting. No one does it like Stanley.",Null,0,0,24 January 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," speechless
","I've literally just returned from seeing this movie. I'm not quite sure what to say. I stayed and watched the credits until the very end of the reel because I didn't want to get out of my seat. I still feel like I'm in a trance. I also feel like crying with the knowledge that this will be the very last Kubrick film. 2001 will always have a special place in my soul, but Stanley was right. This is the best thing he's ever done. Wow.",10,5,10,18 July 1999
The Truman Show," A star is re-born?
","Like another of the commentators before me, this movie reminded me of 'The Prisoner' television program. The Truman Show is a somewhat thoughtful little film, and raises some interesting questions about the nature of privacy and of freedom and free will. The problem I had with it was the premise. I can sort of allow myself to be convinced that a man can be raised under such circumstances and not be any the wiser, providing he is kept happy enough not to examine his world too closely. Heck, I know people like that. What I can't swallow is that so many people could be so enthralled by the act of observing him sleep, eat, pass wind, pick his nose, etc., that it could survive for thirty years on the air. The most surprising thing about this film is Jim Carrey's performance. Sure, his comic persona may peek out once in a while and might be a bit inapropriate, but it's the mark of a potentially great actor who is still a little hesitant to let go for a while of the thing that made his career soar. I've heard it said before that he has the makings of a first rate actor if ever he is given the right opportunity to develop. After seeing The Truman Show, I'd have to agree. What were Tom Hanks and Robin Williams doing fifteen years ago?",Null,0,0,6 March 1999
The Thin Red Line," Good but not quite great
","I was just a little disappointed with this film. I suppose the usual media hyped high expectations were at work, but aside from that I have to say that a few things troubled me.I could attempt to critique the film with the usual attention to artistic merits that everyone else has already done a fine job of, and I could do the inevitable comparisons to Saving Private Ryan, using a point by point comparison.What I'll do instead is resort to a much more visceral approach and simply point out that at the end of this movie I found that I was glad to have seen it but would not care to go to either the trouble or the expense to see it again on the big screen. I can try to disect a film 'till I'm blue in the face, but I've found that my final indication of any films worth to me is my desire to revisit it. I would run out to see Citizen Kane again in a second if it were re-released, I went to the theatre to see the re-release of The Wizard of Oz and I would like the opportunity to see Saving Private Ryan again on the big screen.I will probably see this film again at some point in the future on video, but I can wait a long, long time. Enough said.",Null,0,1,18 January 1999
