The Blair Witch Project," One of the most effective no-budget films ever
","The Blair Witch Project consists of footage that was found in the Maryland woods where three college students had disappeared back in 1994. The footage is what they saw. These 80 minutes are the last days of their lives. The footage is horrifying, chilling, disturbing, and haunting. We see these three kids have a lot of fun at first, but then things don't go exactly as planned. They lose their map, they get lost, and they find strange trinkets and symbols around their campsite. As they get more and more lost and the situation gets more and more hopeless, the situations start getting even more disturbing. They are attacked in the middle of the night, they scream, shove, and attack each other, and the sounds they hear in the middle of the night get even more disturbing and horrifying. The last twenty minutes of this film are some of the most hardcore scenes of horror I've seen in a modern horror film. It all leads up to an ending that contains one last creepy image that will likely be ingrained into your mind forever after you have watched the film. The Blair Witch Project is a film that uses atmosphere to create a foreboding sense of dread, suspense, and intensity. The film is scary, not because of what you see, but what you don't see. Most of the horrific scenes in the film are scary because of the power of suggestion and of fear of the unknown. We don't see monsters. We don't see what happens to these kids in the woods with our eyes. We do see what happens in our minds, and that's a lot more terrifying than anything that the film could show us. The fact that there's no logic to the horror adds a level of unease and makes the viewer feel not only completely scared but also helpless. That's how I felt when I watched the film. It is one of the weirdest and most disturbing low(VERY low) budget films I've seen.",Null,0,2,27 January 2009
The Mask," One of the best comedies of the 90s
","THE MASK is the story about a nice guy, Stanley Ipkiss, who is unhappy. He has a landlord who always yells at him, a boss who always berates him, and people always take advantage of his nice nature. One day, his life changes. He comes upon a mask in the lake and puts it on. Upon putting on the mask, he is transformed into a kind of comedic troublemaker who can do anything. What results is one of the funniest and most enjoyable comedies made in the past twenty years. Jim Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss totally perfect. His character is so quirky and likable, and yet he manages to let loose way further as the mask. The mask, in question, only contributes to an already very rubber face. The visual effects are all very inventive and original, especially for the time! Cameron Diaz makes a stunning acting debut as the woman of Stanley's dreams. I haven't even mentioned the big bank heist, references to Tex Avery, the climactic fight scene, the two incredibly brilliant dance sequences, or the adorable dog yet. All I have to say is that all these subplots are balanced perfectly. There are some incredible sight gags herein, the exploding windshield early in the film still makes me laugh. This is a wonderful film and it certainly entertained me more than than most 90s comedies. I highly recommend this film if you're looking for a fun laugh.Pros: -Excellent performances from Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz -Amazing visual effects -awesome dog performance -the two dance scenes to end all dance scenes Cons: -cheesy villain and resolution to that -it ends a little too quickly",Null,2,2,6 July 2008
Fight Club," One of the most brutally honest mainstream films about mental illness that you're ever likely to see
","Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club explores the darker side of mental instability in the form of a dark comedy. The film tells the rather unsettling story of an insomnia stricken man, played by Edward Norton. His life changed one day when he meets a mysterious soap maker named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and, after his apartment room is blown up along with all of his belongings and the little that remains of his personal life, they became inspired to co-create a seedy underground club in which men are invited to attend and to pummel on each other to their heart's content as a form of physical therapy as well as an advanced form of personal male-bonding. Things get complex when a female drifter named Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who inadvertently gets involved in the mentally deteriorated world that these two men share. Things only get worse when Tyler decides to take the club out onto the streets and then into their homes and into the lives of more political and respected people.As technically talented as Fincher is, what I admire most about the film is how he doesn't let the visuals tell the story. The sarcastic, bitter, angry narration of Edward Norton that plays over the events helps a lot in driving the atmosphere of the film into it's audience, but it also adds to the humor of the film. Is the film a satire? Yes. Then why the sly, cool tone, the clever dialogue, and the slick visuals? Well, to me it all seemed very forced and over-the-top. Nobody in the real world talks like these characters, and it seems pretty obvious that the film is self-aware. You can tell in the sarcastic narration. I think that people may likely forget that we're watching the story unfold from the perspective of someone who is obviously crazy. Every person in this film is crazy in one way or another. What makes the film so bizarre is the fact the thoughts of the main character make sense in the sense that they have rationale to them. The physical appearance of the main character slowly grows worse and worse while the characters around him grow more positive, more open-minded, and more like he was at the start. What makes this so funny is the fact that the methods these characters use to make themselves happier are so completely irrational and ridiculous. Not to ruin the plot, but when it comes to illegal acts of vandalism involving public property being destroyed, there comes a point where politics don't seem so important in retrospect since we live in such an interesting and advanced time in the world today.Looking at this film ten years later, it still has just as much power as it did in 1999 or 2000 or whenever it was when people decided to start watching it. As I said before, David Fincher is a technical talent. His films often hold an incredible amount of visual energy, and Fight Club is no different. The performances are excellent. Edward Norton's performance here is one of his best, as is Helena Bonham Carter. As for Brad Pitt, he does exactly what the role requires from him and kudos to his for being such a good sport for being in this film. The music in this film works equally as well. It's very dirty, industrial, and overbearing, much like the film itself. The film just has a tremendous spirit, though I can't say that I actually enjoy watching it. It's full of blood and guts from beginning to end, it's often very ugly to look at, and the film feels a little too dirty in that way that makes you want to shower. This is also a very very homo-erotic film, not just in the fight scenes but also in the way the male characters act around and toward each other. I can't say that I'm anywhere near as infatuated with it as I was when I was in high school, where any film that tried new things seemed revolutionary and brilliant, and just as well, this film makes it very difficult to take Brad Pitt seriously in most of his other films. The fight scenes in this film are also excellently choreographed and the gore effects in these scenes are wonderfully done. The final shot of the film may, at once, be considered by some to be an amazing and rebellious shot, but I laugh just thinking about it due to another very brief image in one frame of the shot that occurs just as the credits are appearing.So overall, Fight Club is still an entertaining film. It's funny, it's dark, and it provides a very honest depiction of mental illness that very few films have the balls to explore. The film has developed a strange cult following, reminiscent of the cult audience surrounding American Psycho. These people seem to feel that these two films contain deep philosophical messages about the nature of humanity, but they definitely don't. I don't think the characters in Fight Club should be taken completely seriously and I'm astounded that anyone even could take them seriously. It's like saying that Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon was right to rob the bank and that the police were all wrong. Both sides made mistakes and both sides learned things, but that doesn't change the finale of the film. If you're going to watch Fight Club, please don't try to watch it with an open-mind about the characters and the things that they say. Watch it knowing everything that you know now about politics, science, religion, and humanity. I'm sure that the film will have the desired effect on you.",Null,0,3,21 May 2010
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," A brilliant satire, but also an honest comment on parental responsibility, censorship, and morality.
","Stan, Kyle, Ike, Eric, and Kenny all go to an R rated film which is an adaptation of their favorite show, a crude humor filled Canadian skit comedy called TERRANCE AND PHILIP. Upon leaving, they imitate the language in the film, prompting their parents to react in surprisingly shocking ways. They start the MAC(Mothers Against Canada) before getting president Clinton involved along with talk show host Conan O'Brian before arresting Terrence and Philip and putting all Canadian-American citizens into special Concentration camps. Canada decides to act upon this and thus a gory war on Canada is declared. The boys realize that it's up to them to fix things before Satan takes over the world as soon as Terrence and Philip are executed. The fact that this film is animated is what makes it funny and ironic. In a way, the film is making a comment on itself and it's source material. The fact that the film has something very relevant to say about first amendment rights is what makes it daring and worth seeing. I do not know of any other film that does this. The originality of the concept really helps it define it's ability to be watchable. I consider the show, SOUTH PARK, to be one of the most brilliant and funniest television shows to come around for a while. This film not only pushes the idea of the show in a direction that makes sense, but it also takes into consideration the feedback the show gets for it's language and subject matter. Everything about this film is pretty perverse. Anybody can figure that out by just the title, SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER, AND UNCUT. When it was in theaters, a lot of people I knew who had no idea what the show was just assumed that it was a pornographic film. Indeed, there were times in the film in which the content was pushed a little too far. However, the show does this to me almost all of the time. What makes the show really special to me is that it actually bothers to challenge me and what I can handle in a way that works because it is animated. There are times when the show is really hilarious and over-the-top, and there are times when it actually challenges the viewer to laugh. There are times on the show in which there are genuinely emotional moments and times where there is heartless cruelty. This film is no different. The character of Eric Cartman has to deal with a V-chip that is surgically implanted into his head that caused him to get shocked when he swears. Stan is in love with a girl in his class who he can't have. Kyle's mother is the woman who starts the coalition against Canada and is forced to deal with the embarrassment of that and has to protect his adopted younger brother Ike as he is Canadian. These plights in this movie are treated with more sincerity and respect than they probably ever would in another movie. To help push things along and add even more emotion, there are also musical segments. The film is a musical and the songs in them are fantastic. This film has one of the better soundtracks of the last ten years. This film will always hold a special place in my heart. Nine years later, it is still amazing and funny as hell. Definitely check this one out if you haven't yet.",Null,2,2,13 May 2008
Brokeback Mountain," If you like really epic and intense films, this is for you. A remarkably solid film about family, bisexuality, and coming-of-age
","So BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is the film known as the 'gay cowboy movie'. I think it's a little too easy to call it that. For a supposed 'gay' film, it's not very gay. There's one sex scene between two men, but it's so brief and so quick and so mild in every way that it probably could have been filmed in the 1930s. It's not even a sex scene really. You see them grope each other and then you see them wrestling, then Heath Ledger spits on his fingers, the we see Jake Gyllenhaal's pleasured facial expression and then they moan, and then it ends!!! I went into this film expecting a ton of gay sex and penises and stuff and that scene was all I got. Sure, we see Heath Ledger have sex with his wife, but that's different. But I guess it doesn't matter because the film is really good! Ang Lee did exactly what I was hoping he would do. He tells the story of two men who have similar lives who get especially intimate with each other and then spend the next ten to thirty years trying to deal with it. It's a very moving film. Ennis(Heath Ledger) marries and has a girl. Jack(Jake Gyllenhaal) goes out to find love with several different women. They both care for each other but they also still love the women in their lives as well. Who can blame them? Their wives are incredibly attractive and both have beautiful bodies. Still, they are ashamed and they still find conflict in what they are doing. I don't want to give too much away, but their situations become increasingly desperate and they have a harder and harder time letting go. Is it a love story? Kind of. Is this thing that these two men share really love? What I do know is that they definitely care about each other and they will do anything for each other. They both are what the other person has been looking for in a human being. They both can talk more comfortably about life and about anything with each other than they can with their wives and children. They both admire each other to a degree that is quite beautiful. They share so much and are very fond of each other. Maybe that's what love is. However, they both love the women in their lives as well. I'm not 100% sure it is love that they share or if it is compassion, but for the sake of simplifying something that is complicated I'll call in love. People can love their friends, their pets, their children, their neighbors, and even their wives. The thing that these men have for each other is love, and it's the most pure and innocent kind of love. It's not a sexual love or a weird, sick, confused type of love. They don't love each other for their manly looks and their desire to have the other jump their bones. The two men love each other as human beings. If one of them were a woman, it would be the exact same thing. If they were two women it would be the exact same thing. These two men just want to be with each other and want to share their lives, and it's a beautiful thing to watch grow and progress. I don't exactly know why this film was controversial. There were other films that came out that had gay sex scenes that were far more graphic than the scene in this film(MYSTERIOUS SKIN). But whatever. People have been known to waste time, so I guess it doesn't matter. What I do know is that this is a beautiful film that I highly recommend to anybody who just wants to watch a straight-forward, emotional, strong, well made film. Definitely check it out. It's a masterpiece.",Null,13,14,10 September 2008
Silent Hill," Disturbing and grotesque, but beautiful and gripping
","Everything works except the story in the second half of the picture. I will say that for the first half, the storyline works great. There's a crazy back story involving the town folk being burnt alive and killed by an underground coal mine explosion. Ash rains from the sky, fog drapes the area, and all these deformed victims begin appearing. There's this one guy who crawls out of a rotten looking stall whose feet are tied to the back of his neck with barbed wire, dead children who implode into flames, and in particular, a giant of a man with an even bigger triangular shaped beak on the top of his head, The Pyramid Head, who carries around a gigantic knife and strips the entire flesh off of humans with one pull of his wrist. All that was all cool and interesting. But then about halfway through, they just dropped all of that and suddenly all the fun went away and the film became a horrific decent into cults and macabre rituals involving the burning of a little girl. The switch is so inappropriate and totally not at all what should have happened. The film is incredible looking, the sound editing and music are very haunting and clever, the acting is quite believable all around, and the film is really pretty creepy. There were a few parts that definitely scared me. However, the switch halfway through from ghost story to crazy cult fanatic story just mucks it all up a little. There's an interesting subplot involving the husband of the woman who gets lost that remains quite engaging and helps add more suspense. The last twenty minutes of the film are a real gore-fest. There is an incredible sequence in which people are torn apart and split open by flying barbed wire, including one woman being picked up and getting ripped open from the inside out by it. It's pretty creative, but unfortunately if you only saw the first twenty minutes and the last twenty minutes, they literally have almost no connection. The way the film ends is pretty chilling, but it also appears to be a little too reminiscent of David Lynch in some strange way as it revolves around parallel universes, alternate dimensions, and people getting stuck in a twisted variation of the space-time continuum. It all sat well with me, but what caused me to get quite disturbed by the film was a particular favorite character of mine got really brutalized and tortured before slowly being incinerated. That bothered me more than almost anything I've seen in years and it happens right at the end to just to add insult to injury. The film worked in that it got to me in such a deep way, but I still can't recommend it to everybody due to the sudden jump into weird supernatural demonic stuff. It's too weird. I love the video games, however, and I really dug the references and the camera angles. French director Christophe Gans must be congratulated for making a video game movie work so well. It's the best one I've seen so far. I think even people who've never played the video game would even enjoy it for what it is. It's a little gross, but I liked it. Hang tight though. It starts out quite slow and takes it's time before picking up speed about thirty minutes in.",Null,0,1,19 June 2008
Crash," Not My Kind of Movie, But Certainly Well Made and Interesting.
","When the lives of an L.A. cop, a half black couple, two black thugs, a rich couple, a black man whose mom favors his son, a middle easter shopkeeper, a Mexican mechanic and his daughter, and a rookie cop collide, there is no stopping the skid marks from appearing. This film was made in the style of one of my favorite films. MAGNOLIA. The different characters and they way they interact with each other just gives off that fresh cinematic feel. The film works very well.The whole racist theme seems at first to be what holds the character's lives together, but these characters are very human and everyone does know people who behave these ways. The acting is, overall, top-notch. The storyline is generally well crafted, and everything else, from the music score to the filming style and cinematography, is perfect. And yet, I do not like this movie.It is simply not my kind of movie. I don't really like movies that try to give you meaning and not knowing how to do it. Don't get me wrong, this film has a good message, but the way it is delivered feels too overdone. This film will make you think, and this film does need to be talked about after it is finished, but I just wish the film gave the audience a chance.Not everyone likes a movie that teaches you or forces you to think. But by giving the film too much of a grim tone set aside by spectacular and inspiring and breathtaking scenes, it just doesn't feel right. And that's where MAGNOLIA gets it right. And that's why this film irritates me. There is a particular scene near the end that i will not ruin suffix to say that the scene throws a completely unfair blow to the audience. It is especially irritating that the circumstances surrounding the scene are completely unlikely.Overall, i recommend the film and i do feel that there was a great deal of talent working on it. The film had won Best Picture for the Academy Awards of 2005. Do I think it should have won? Hell no. The other four films that were nominated were wonderful films that i felt deserved the Oscar far more than this. This, to me, was okay, as a film, its a step in the right direction. I just wish that the stem was a little bit bigger, thats all. Recommended. I hope that it dazzles you and changes your life.",Null,8,11,13 December 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A gore fest of a Musical, and also one of Tim Brton's strongest films.
","A disgusting gore fest of a musical, but there is a kind of uniqueness to it that I felt really helped it be worth more credit than just the goriest film of the year. I felt that Helena Bonham Carter was particularly impressive in this picture and she added a much needed lightness to the material. Johnny Depp does fine with singing. Sacha Baron Cohen was quite bizarre. The first half of the film was rather stylish and moving, with barely any on-screen violence, but the second half was just an all out blood feast, littered with spraying arteries, broken bones, and sliced flesh. It's all rather foul, but the film still feels alive despite having a lot of washed out colors and pale skin. If you don't mind A LOT of blood and gore, it's probably worth seeing. But there were parts that really grossed me out. Still, the violence didn't ruin the film for me. Check it out. It has some neat songs.",Null,2,4,2 January 2008
Taxi Driver," My favorite Martin Scorsese film.
","It is an intense allegory of a lonely and disturbed taxi driver. He drives around the city doing his job and hating it. This man does not have a good life or anything close to a good motive. Whether it be from his insomnia with the painful memories of the Vietnam war or just wanting to get out of his version of hell, the streets of New York, is irrelevant. One day, he meets a child prostitute and is so disturbed by her situation that he decides to use her as an opportunity to act out in violent and unusual ways. When I watched picture I wondered if I was supposed to feel sorry for this man. I felt like I shouldn't have, but I did. He is so disturbed and so inhuman, but in his mind he is perfectly stable and strong. I love films that challenge me like this one did. Travis Bickle is not a good person. That's one of the things that is established almost right away. He is among one of the most insane and disturbed characters I've seen in a motion picture. However, unlike other films that would paint him in a negative and stereotypical light, Scorsese has the balls to force us into his mind and force us to see the world from his eyes. We recognize what state of mind he lives in and what he feels about this world he sees. It is very unpleasant, but it is a powerful and daring thing for Scorsese to do. There are parts in this film that seem to say that hell is the only place that Travis could exist in, no matter what. He is incapable of existing outside of this realm of decadence and self-destruction. He searches for good things in his life and grabs hold of them so tightly that he forces them to become bad things in his life to suit his situation. Eventually, the film comes to the conclusion that he should stop searching for good things to change his life, and start searching for bad things so that other people's lives can change. The film is hard to watch at some parts, not because of it's explicit violence, but because of the emotional pain that Travis goes through. The hardest scene to watch is a part where Travis picks up a deranged passenger played by Martin Scorsese himself. A film like this is special when it can achieve those kind of emotions from a viewer. The emotional pain is a lot harder to watch than the extreme violence that occurs in this film.That's not to say that the violence is easy to watch because it isn't at all. It is sickeningly abrasive and nightmarish, yet strangely enchanting. The blood looks very much like red paint, with a slightly light tone to it that makes it looks somewhat pretty when splattered on the wall.. It is all the more so in that the film forces us to view this and shoves our faces in it while trying it's best to spare us from the emotional pain. This is one of Scorsese's finest and most complete films. It is a powerful and polarizing work of art. It is among one of the most emotional and suspenseful films I can say that I've seen and it's one that you'll definitely remember!",Null,1,1,22 June 2005
Barry Lyndon," Kubrick's Most Accessible film.
","This was an exciting and uplifting film about what a person of lower class can accomplish when they put their mind to it. This is just the kind of film that one just can sit back and admire and take it all in all the while still being entertained by how resilient the main characters are of their surroundings and the whole idea about if you want something done right you have to do it yourself. It doesn't even matter whether or not he's a good guy because, really, at the end of the day these sorts of elements would've detracted from this sort of story. For some reason, people find this film boring, although i found it to be constantly entertaining due to the whole narration bit and how the film doesn't just jump around but actually takes it's time to allow the viewer to analyze the whole thing. The music score is simply wonderful. If I could pick a favorite Kubrick film, which is difficult since almost all of them are so wonderful, this would definitely be one that could tie with whichever one i choose if i choose one other than this one. A perfect film that is easily Kubrick's most accessible.",Null,1,6,24 April 2008
Full Metal Jacket," One of the Greatest War Films.
","War can make monsters out of anybody, but the desensitization of the effects of war may not be from actual combat. This is a horrible film to sit through, but i is intelligent and knows exactly what it is talking about when it comes to the effects of war. This isn't really a war film so much as it's a study of manic insanity and disturbed behavior. Many people will be upset by the fact that the two best developed characters die about fifty minutes in, but I found it to be an effective way of breaking down barriers that all war films are forced into having. Usually in war films, there are characters you know you live and characters you know will die. In this, you don't get that sense. Any of these people could die, and that's what makes FULL METAL JACKET so uncommonly effective.",Null,1,4,24 April 2008
Fargo," This is my favorite film of all time.
","The opening shot of the film is the best. It immediately establishes how dry and strange the film is. The opening shot is just white. Eventually out of the white emerges a truck in the middle. It is soon established that what we were looking at was a road. We wouldn't have known this since we couldn't see anything that was indicating that a second ago. The plot(which the film shamelessly exclaims at the beginning is based on a true story) is pretty original. a man, Jerry Lundigard, who is behind in dept needs money. He comes up with an ingenious scheme. He is to hire two criminals to kidnap his innocent wife and ask for a ransom from her rich father. Then, when her father hands over the dough, they split it with him. The plan doesn't go as well as it should. A body count starts across the valley of Minnesota and dead bodies are found everywhere. The two criminals hideout in a cabin in the woods where they try to communicate with Jerry so they can rearrange the deal as blood has been shed by them. Meanwhile, Marge, a very pregnant police officer, gets involved as the body count rises and things get more twisted and more out-of-hand. What makes this film particularly interesting to me are the bystanders. They all sound exactly the way they are supposed to. The film takes place in Minnesota, which I am very familiar with, so the people all have accents and talk a certain way that may sound funny and quite friendly with many people who are not familiar with these kind of people. This puts the film at a really interesting angle and fits perfectly. This may sound weird to have this kind of a dark theme in a film that has such light little quirks, but somehow the Coen brothers pull it off. The theme of the film itself may not fit with many viewers. My mother rented it one time thinking that it was a comedy. She hated it. So this basically puts viewers who have not seen this film in a weird spot. The people going in to it thinking that it'll be a comedy will most likely be disturbed by the strong violence and intense feeling that this film uncomfortably radiates. The people going into it thinking that it's a thriller or a serious drama will be a little bewildered to find the film having a light sense of humor detracting from the horror and the violence. But the people going into it wishing nothing more than for it to be an entertaining film will most likely be satisfied. That being said, I really loved this movie and have watched it millions of times. There are very few people i know who, surprisingly, don't really like it. It is so weird when i see a film that, in my eyes is brilliant, but i then recommend it to somebody and they return saying nothing but how much they hated it. This film doesn't appeal to everyone. Anyway, the film's music score is so beautiful in expressing the grim looking locations and the intensity of the storyline. With it's droning violin hang downs and its low sounding rhythm, the score sounds beautiful and makes it more than worthwhile to get the soundtrack. The haters of this film have one good thing that they absolutely can't deny. The acting is completely top-notch. William H. Macy as Jerry is perfectly weaselly as the imperfect husband. Steve Buscemi(one of my favorite actors) is also perfect as the the leader of the two criminals and manages to make somewhat of a sympathetic feeling out of a wacky and sadistic guy. But it is Francis Mcdormand as Marge who truly gives the role of a lifetime as the pregnant cop who has everything to win and is appropriately cheerful when she needs to be. This film's sense of humor can be somewhat dry, but thats partly what makes the film so different. And aside from having the greatest death scene in a film since PSYCHO(1960), boasts incredible believability. This is comparable in terms of very realistic thrillers such as THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE(1974) and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT(1999), and yet can also just about stand next to comedy classics such as PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES(1987), and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL(1972). This film succeeds in spades as being an excessively violent thriller and a chuckle inducing comedy, but what it succeeds most at doing in my eyes is be good entertainment. The ending is so haunting and yet so fitting that it truly seals the deal that this film is an American classic.PROS:-Incredible originality in everything-stunning performances by the whole cast-incredible genuine horror and humor-unpredictable-the most shocking and brilliant ending to a film I've seen-gripping plot and charactersCONS:-the dry humor and the graphic violence isn't for everybody",Null,1,5,3 April 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," Another Letdown from Director Alexandre Aja
","*1/2 out of **** When I saw HIGH TENSION, I was completely disappointed. The film was terrible and unbelievable, and yet it was well acted, sounded great, and looked cool. However, the storyline stretched out into a terrible film in which a lesbian woman completely screws up all of her easy chances of saving her and her friend so many times that the film turned into a big joke. Many people had complained about the ending of the film being terrible, but it was my favorite part of the movie because it confirmed that it was all actually a big joke.Now there were a few little moments in HIGH TENSION that I thought were excellent scare quirks. Two good examples were an early scene in the film where the killer has oral sex with a severed head. And another scene when a tiny little musical device dances on a woman's desk gave the film a creepy mood, but when the thirty minute mark of the film was hit, the film instantly became horrendous. The film was my #1 most hated film of 2003, but I knew that the director of the film could make a good horror film with the right stuff though.Now director Alexandre Aja has made another film. A remake of an early Wes Craven film that is now considered to be one of the best cult classics of horror. THE HILLS HAVE EYES. In it, a whole family is forced to do battle with weird inbred freaks with a cannibalistic urge. This man's remake changes a couple things. First, instead of being weird inbred people, they are now mutated creatures that were the result of a nuclear reactor exploding and melting them. And the family seems to have many more members. Did I think that this film was the good horror film that I have been waiting for? Well I'll tell you...The look of this film is beautiful and ugly, just the way it should be. The characters do seem quite realistic in there own little ways. The mutants are scary and grotesque, and the music is appropriately eerie enough to create the right amount of tension and suspense, and yet it is a terrible film. The reason why has nothing to do with the film being made poorly in any particular area, and I am well aware that a horror film doesn't have to be entertaining or thought provoking to be good(just look at THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE). And I normally have no real complaints about shock value. But this film is just plain disgusting and horribly overdone.Again, this normally wouldn't be a problem at all, but in this case it is. Don't think that I hate shock and gore and disturbing stuff. Some of my favorite films are PINK FLAMINGOS, OLDBOY, BRAINDEAD, ICHI THE KILLER, CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, and IRREVERSIBLE. The film is overdone to excess. The real scares are drowned out by the buckets of gruesome images and events. There is exploding heads, crucifying, burnings, dismemberment, mutilation, cannibalism, and even a couple quasi-rape scenes. The film just isn't worth the time to sit through in my opinion. The film is boring in its excess of flesh and torture and yet somehow gives the impression that it is a serious movie. There is so much gruesome, disgusting, and violent content that the film stopped being scary and because the equivalent of a freak show. It would have worked if it were low budget, but for a theatrical project, it was boring and stupid.The audience in the theater were pretty freaked out. Many girls were crying and screaming, and many boys were jumping at the jump scenes and being shocked by the scenes of violence. The theater was pretty packed when I saw it opening day. This film obviously was an unpleasant experience for them. The number of people who walked out was a little surprising because I honestly was far more grossed out by sAW2 than this. It didn't help that I was watching this with three of my cousins who were all horror film fans. After we all came out when the film was over, all of my cousins said that they hated it, but I didn't hate it. I was just wished that it was done a lot better.I still do not doubt that Alexandre Aja can make a really good horror film, and I know that for a fact now. This film was close, but he overdid it. The original film was bad, yes, but it didn't really matter that it was bad because it tried to be bad. It tried to be trashy and stupid and excessive. This film sucks because it didn't try to be bad. It tried to be good and it had spirit, but it didn't have a heart. The film was too 'in your face'. It was to resilient. It was too unforgiving. A good horror film doesn't have to be any of these things. A good horror film has to have a good story, good characters, and a heart. This had a good story and good characters, but no heart. Oh well. Maybe next time it will be perfect. It was better than HIGH TENSION, but it was still stupid.Rated R for strong gruesome violence and terror throughout, and for language.",Null,0,1,10 July 2006
The Shining," Scary as Hell
","True horror isn't a monster running around eating people, a ghost, or unexplainable phenomena. Sure, all these things can be made scary with enough skill, but what is truly scary is the idea of somebody that you are close to and love more than anybody else in the whole world turns and tries to hurt you and that they aren't the person that you thought they were. This film taps into that idea and uses these ideas as the backbone of what makes this film scary, and by golly it's scary. I actually feel that this is one of the scariest films ever made. No other movie has given me such a sick feeling of vulnerability and being unsafe. I can never forget some of the images in this film, no matter what horror films i watch. This is supposed based on a Stephen King novel, but it is too different to really compare. Just see it. It's the perfect Halloween film.",Null,1,3,24 April 2008
American Beauty," Top-notch 90s classic
","'American Beauty' is a film that deals with death. The film is about Lester's final months. Lester doesn't know that he will die. We find this out within the first minute of the film. We know this just from the opening shot of his own daughter asking her boyfriend if he could kill him for her. We know right away that he is a loser, a geek, and a terrible father and husband. The film details the lives of Lester and the people around him. Lester is married to Carolyn, a perfectionist and an emotional woman. Her and Lester hate each other. They are married with a child but they are not in love. Their daughter is Jane, who is spiteful of her parents behavior. Her parents constantly argue and betray each other. Why should she be happy and proud of her parents who aren't particularly supportive of her, though they try to be.During one of their attempts to be involved more with their daughter's cheerleading, Lester falls for one of her friends, Angela, who he then constantly tries to woo and impress. This eventually leads him to change himself into the person he thinks that he wants to be. Meanwhile, the family has new neighbors. Frank, the homophobic father of Ricky, who is in love with Jane and videotapes her through his window. When Ricky becomes friends with Lester, Frank begins to suspect that he is gay. 'American Beauty' does something that isn't done enough in American films today. It actually makes us feel for the characters. None of these characters are bad people. Their decisions are bad, but all any of them want is for things to work out for themselves. They are all very good people. They just got too caught up in what they think society wants them to do or doesn't want them to do, though Lester rebels instead. He is sick of how society treats him and how everybody treats him. He goes a different way than he is expected and attempts to become his own person. He lusts after a teenager, despite the fact that he is middle-aged. A lot of middle-aged people secretly do this, however, it's only a serious problem if they act out on their desires. Does Lester do this? It's a difficult question to answer, though I guess, in a sense, he doesn't. But why does he lust after her? Does he lust after her because he is beautiful or because she is a mirror image of what beauty is supposed to apparently look like? Carolyn is an interesting character. She tries incredibly hard to sell a house at her job and berates herself for failing. Is she past the point in which she isn't able to even feel anything anymore? Has she become that numb to her problems? These people are not close and their marriage doesn't mean anything. The only people in the whole movie who are actually happy are their two gay neighbors. Jane wants breast augmentation surgery, but why? Her breasts already look pretty big. Does she think that people will like her if her breasts look fake? If they were any bigger, that's what they would look like. Why does she feel that people wants girls that look fake. She is already lusted after by Ricky. Ricky, at first, appears to be a really strange person. Angela speaks of rumors involving him going to a mental asylum. They may or may not be true, but that's not the point. The point is that he is unashamed of who he is and this makes him an interesting character to compare with all the other characters. His father doesn't seem to realize that his son is on to his mental tricks and that Ricky only tells him what he wants to hear rather than speaking his mind about the issues that he brings up. Frank doesn't really hate homosexuals, but the way he was brought up allows him to think that way. This is especially evident in a surreal scene toward the end. What I haven't mentioned is the sheer intensity of the film and the events leading up to the death of Lester. Indeed, the last thirty minutes of the film remain very suspenseful and revealing. They are full of so many bizarre coincidences and misinterpretations that it's actually quite funny to watch at times. It's a painful final act, but it's also a surprisingly insightful depiction and comment on loneliness and being hopeless in troubles. The last ten minutes are surprisingly honest and unique in that the viewer feels enlightened when, in reality, the things we are told are things we all know but don't realize that we know any of it until we are reminded by a film like this. Do people need to watch films like this? Absolutely. How else are we able to be reminded of what we know about human existence. The things that are brought to light in the final minutes are not things we learn, but rather things we know and pick up on when we are infants and are developing. As babies, we make mistakes and learn from them. We don't remember those mistakes, but we remember what we know. The philosophy behind this film is that a lot of us were brought up to not make mistakes and to learn what the parents and teachers teach in elementary school and in our early years as humans. But in this being done, we are not able to develop into our own people. Instead, we take what we can get, use it, and then grow up having learned nothing except that we should only know certain things. 'American Beauty' is one of the ideal examples of brilliant film-making.",Null,2,4,29 April 2008
Edward Scissorhands," One of the greatest films ever made
","Tim Burton's EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. It is simply such a treat to watch a film about a man with such childlike ability and innocence. And yet he has talent and a good heart. He creates art and is happy to know that what he thought was just a hobby to do when he's bored can be so attention grabbing. This fantasy film is a simple one told mostly in images. An Avon lady(Diane Weist) is having a typical rotten day when she sees a creepy looking castle way off in the distance. She takes her chances and drives all the way up to the castle. She finds a pale looking man(Johnny Depp) in the attic and sees that he is missing his hands and in place of where his hands should be, there are different shards and colors of scissors. This sight scares her at first, but eventually she feels deeply sorry for him and takes him home with her. The neighbors see him in her car and so begins the gossip. 'A man with scissors for hands?!' 'What a weird looking man!' 'Who in the world is that?' 'What is he doing here?' The man is talked about by everyone. He befriends the Avon lady's laid back husband(Alan Arkin) and her young son(Robert Oliveri).Later in the film, The Avon Lady's beautiful daughter, Kim(Wynona Rider), shows up and meets Edward too. And eventually he becomes popular with the neighbors when he shows that his scissor hands can create absolute beauty. Unfortunitly, he is taken advantage of, and that is when darkness begins to shroud the town's usual colorful spirit. Edward has disadvantages with his scissor hands and yet nobody except for Kim sees him as a man who is complicated and scared of this new world he has entered. Edward is somewhat clumsy, he is very unsettling looking with his cuts and scars all over his face, and he is quiet. Everyone ignores these characteristics except for Kim. The neighbors, when he shows something different in his usual activities, freak out! The people run from him, he is molested in the back of a hair salon by a strange woman, he is attacked by Kim's boyfriend, and he ends up being expelled from this so called normal world. The musical score by Danny Elfman is absolutely spell bounding. Quite possibly the prettiest soundtrack in motion picture history. It completely fits with the classic feel of the neighborhood and the mystery of Edward. This is my favorite Tim Burton film and I believe that everyone should see it for its beauty, its love, its look, and Edward. The film is hypnotizing. Vincent Price, the nice inventor, gives his best( and last) performance to date, and the flashbacks involving him are an absolute joy to watch. They are touching, beautiful, revealing, horrifying, and spell bounding. He may have been even more childlike than Edward in fact. In one flashback, he is shown reading to Edward and he suddenly exclaims 'This is boring!' so he switches to some funny poetry and teaches Edward to smile. This film must be seen.",Null,1,2,17 February 2006
Control," I normally don't like biopics about people who committed suicide, but this really struck me
","Being a Joy Division fan, I wasn't crazy about seeing a film about someone whose talent I'm a huge fan of committing suicide. I was intrigued, however, by the director Anton Corbijn who was the man responsible for many of the photographs that we've seen on the band on stage. This is his directorial debut, unless you count his music videos, and I'm always interested to see the films of first-time directors.I wasn't expecting the film to really tell me much about Ian Curtis or Joy Division, which is fine. All I really wanted was the film to tell a story. I didn't want to watch anything like WALK THE LINE, which, despite being a well made film, is just a plot less tribute piece that nobody can really enjoy unless they're a Johnny Cash fan. That was the main thing I was afraid of when sitting down to watch CONTROL. Needless to say, I was not disappointed in the least.There isn't really much to say about the film in terms of what it's about. It pretty much details Ian Curtis's life and the rise of the Joy Division band from the perspective of Ian Curtis before depicting his complete disintegration and destruction all the way up to his suicide. To keep things interesting are the many people in his life which is what develops the plot.Samantha Morton, in particular, is the main driving force in the life of the film as well as the voice of reason and she is the sole witness to all the pain and horror that constantly overshadows the film. His band members are also depicted much the same way, though without as much of the witnesses. They understand that he's in much pain but due to Ian Curtis's attitude they don't allow it to affect their lives as much which is what leads the band to a sort of semi-downfall, though they would later pick up and become New Order.The thing is, the film is as much an art-film as it is a biopic. There is much attention granted to the visuals and the editing that gives the film a rather haunting and dreamlike quality, yet at the same time it lends the film a kind of gritty and uncommon sense of dread and sadness that makes the film feel a lot more personal and intimate than you would expect.It's terrifying to watch at times knowing that it's based on a true story, but that was the aim of the film obviously. What struck me more about the film was how it didn't sugarcoat the cons of being part of that kind of lifestyle. I think because of this the film allows more humanity to shine, which is ultimately very much needed in this story. The film comes off truly beautifully because of this.I think what a lot of people dislike about this film are the more artistic moments in which the film just lets things unfold naturally. There are a lot of really long takes and close-ups of many meditative moments. This doesn't make the film boring in the slightest because the tone of the film is so fascinating. The film is extremely slow-paced, but it helps to allow the viewer to digest the atmosphere of the time period so that you can really get into the story.I think the other thing that a lot of people dislike about the film is the way that Ian Curtis and the band is depicted. It's not a very positive depiction, but I wouldn't call it negative either. Just, very human. I think people need to remember that this isn't a documentary, it's an artistic reinterpretation. It doesn't have to go by the facts because if it did there wouldn't be as much to appreciate in terms of human interaction. In addition, the film already is intimate enough.This isn't a film for everyone. It's extremely depressing and gut-wrenching at times. It's a very bleak film and it really doesn't make you feel good about life. It's a very quiet and simple film and I understand that a lot of people want there to be a lot of depth with this kind of story when there really isn't any depth to it. Ian Curtis had some serious problems and when he couldn't take it anymore he committed suicide.The film is unflinching and ultimately one of the most powerful biopics I've seen. So what if it doesn't have a good detailing of all the events of the time period like Michael Winterbottom's 24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE? Even though I like 24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE more than CONTROL, though I still love CONTROL. CONTROL is a powerful and very moving piece of film-making and I, for one, and very happy that I saw it.",Null,1,2,4 July 2009
American History X," Solid film
","Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors, and he does a fantastic job as usual. This is definitely one if his most intense roles ever. And Edward Furlong, of course, is a fine young actor who pulls the right heart strings in this. The film is about a former skinhead leader who gets out of jail and sets his sights on diverting the influence of the gangs from his younger brother. He wants to tell him his story and tell him why he quit being one. Will he succeed? The film packs a punch and has some terrifying sequences. It wasn't a perfect film. It lacks the gritty realism that worked so well in ROMPER STOMPER, it lacks the subtlety that made A CLOCKWORK ORANGE so terrifying, and it lacks the style that gave personality to TRAINSPOTTING. It definitely had a real human side to it, and it certainly shows when it's prevalent. I recommend American HISTORY X because it's a good film. Don't expect to enjoy it though.",Null,0,2,30 July 2007
Saw III," Despite Some Deep Flaws, this Film is generally solid, although fans might be heavily split(no pun intended).
","** out of ****I went to see this one opening day on the 26th or whatever, and i have to say that i got pretty much what i was expecting. Gore. Now don't get me wrong. I was pretty much positive that this film wasn't gonna scare me, despite high theatrics, good plot, and a generally dark tone. Well, it had all that, but the main attraction here is the violence.The plot consists of a low level nurse being forced to try to keep Jigsaw alive for as long as another man can pass tests in some other rooms in the area whilst Jigsaw is dying of cancer. In case you haven't seen the first two films, i'll fill you in. The Jigsaw killer's hook is that he never really kills anybody but rather gets people to kill them out of their own foolishness. This film has a nasty, awkward, weird vibe to start with in the first few minutes when people are stuck in traps that are pretty much impossible to survive no matter how hard they try or no matter how smart they are. This film is really strange because the first two films were pretty much puzzle films. Many people probably liked the first two films because of the puzzling aspects of those films. But unfortunately for sAW3(at least until the end, where the twists occur) there really aren't any aspects of the film that really make you think about the situations.What replaces it are some truly painful and disturbing scenes of torture and gore that become nearly unwatchable for the faint-hearted. This film is a true gore-fest in the latest tradition, and while I'm glad that they totally topped HOSTAL in that area, I'm hesitant to recommend this film. But if you are a fan of gore, which many who saw the first two films were, boy oh boy are you in for a treat!!! This film is probably the goriest film so far this year. For example, there's a device called 'The Rack' in which a man has his head, arms, and legs all plastered up to a big machine. And every once in a while, the spokes twist and twist his arms and legs and neck with it. Needless to say, there is a lot of snapping bones and compound fracture complete with overdone sound effects and gore. In another awesome scene, a woman has her entire ribcage torn out while attached to a metal apparatus.So yeah, generally i'd say if you love gore, check it out, if you're looking for a good puzzle film, try to sit through it till the end. If you have a strong stomach and are looking for something scary for Halloween, check it out. Although certainly not as scary or intense as THE DEPARTED, it has a couple edge of your seat moments that should get you good. Check it out.Rated R for strong grisly violence and gore, sequences of terror and torture, nudity and language.",Null,2,3,2 November 2006
Pearl Harbor," The film was Stupid. I wished I had Not Watched it.
","* out of ***This film is an adaptation of the events surrounding the tragic American event that took place on the military base Pearl Harbor. The lives that were lost will forever be a sad reminder of the horrible nature of war. Unfortunately, this film is not a good portrait of the event. I feel bad for hating this film so deeply because the event that it is about is not one that should be screwed around with, and with such a tragic event you would hope that all the people who decide to do stories about it do it with care and respect for the event.Basically what this is is a three way love triangle in which the event of Pearl Harbor just so happens to happen right in the background. And with such an inconvenient event taking place at such an inconvenient time, everybody in the film, for no reason at all, is forced to act stupid and pretend that they don't know what they are doing. The only bright spot of the entire film is the Cuba Gooding Jr. character, who is brave, smart, and very memorable. Unfortunately, he gets surprisingly little screen time.When the event of Pearl Harbor actually occurs, we are left a little underwhelmed. The same things blow up repeatedly over and over with very little care for continuity and humanity, and more for just technical effect. Take for instance the sequence in which a bomb hits a boat and sinks it. The result involves a lot of people flying all over the place in all different directions and being blown to several pieces by different planes. The effect just comes off as gratuitous rather than sad. The CGI is terrible.The director Michael Bay, has made some very enjoyable action films that I cared for hugely. The Rock was one of the most entertaining action films of the 90s, The Island was entertaining, Bad Boys was pretty good though the sequel was just gross, Armageddon was the closest a film has come to giving me a heart attack, and Transformers was alright. So far Pearl Harbor is his worst film yet!",Null,4,6,16 July 2007
No Country for Old Men," The Best Movie of 2007, and the Most Horrifying.
","The Coen brothers have outdone themselves with this crazy and unforgettable masterpiece of a film. Based on the book, the film tells the story of the discovery of $2 million, heroin, and a lot of dead bodies. When an outsider cowboy type dude discovers these things, his whole life is in jeopardy when an extremely dangerous mass murderer armed with a cattle retracting gun comes after him. Meanwhile, a police man gets on the trail of the killer, but doesn't take into consideration that this man is impossible to get in contact with without dying. The film also has three perfect performances from Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem. Tommy Lee Jones is delightful as the old timer who isn't up to the times so much as he doesn't get what is going on. He contributes a solid supporting performance. Javier Bardem is creepy as hell as the demented killer. There were parts where he was so ratty and nasty, he reminded me of Nosferatu. He gave me the chills. Josh Brolin is the main character who finds the money and the dead bodies. He contributes a character who always has to be on his toes ad who could die any second. The scenes in which he must evade the killer are extremely suspenseful. I had to shut my eyes at one part in which the killer is about to blow his gun through a lock on a door that Josh Brolin is directly on the other side of. Add to all this one of the most chilling endings in recent years and you've got yourself an entertaining, unforgettable, and extremely suspenseful masterwork of a film that also happens to be funny and that also works in what it represents. It represents the generation gap between the old and the young and how ill-prepared both are, the fact that Vietnam veterans deserved to be treated better than they were when they got back to the states, and also the fact that life is funny and that the most unexpected things can happen, even to sick people. This was the craziest and most intelligent film I've seen in years!",Null,1,8,7 December 2007
Twilight," Ludicrous, but in an interesting way.
","Here is a film that just feels wrong in so many ways. The film, as you all probably know by now, is about a girl and a vampire who fall in love. I understand that the idea of a girl falling in love with a vampire is rather fascinating since vampires are often depicted as being very sensual and strange. However, the idea of a vampire falling in love with a human to the point where he refuses to suck her blood makes no sense. It's makes as much sense as a dog falling in love with dog food. The humans are the prey and the vampires are the predator. However, that's just the tip of the iceberg. I have several questions about this movie and I have several confusions. My main complaint about this movie regards the female characters. They're all weaklings. Why do female characters always get depicted as weaklings who always work in the kitchen and must let the big strong man fight the battles and defend her? Why can't we have a popular movie with a strong female character? It's stupid! There's no women to look up to in this movie. In addition, the main female character, Bella, is just as lifeless as the vampires themselves. I actually thought that she was a vampire at the beginning of the film because she was so much paler than everyone else! There's one scene where she has to pretend to be a vampire and I thought to myself 'That should be hard!' Then they make a big deal out of it as if it's the ultimate challenge or something. It's really funny! However, that brings me to my next complaint. The lack of conflict. Why do nearly all the characters, including the head vampire family, have to be so damn unusual and strange and quirky and kooky and bizarre? What is the deal with all the male characters being surrounded by so many women? Why on earth does a vampire's skin reflect and bunch of diamond-like shards? Why doesn't their skin burn? What is with all the racism toward the Native-Americans??? Why are they getting called wolves? Why is the Bella character so popular when she appears to be so anti-social? The sole highlight of the film is Taylor Lautner's character. Taylor is a truly beautiful boy and I feel bad for him that he's involved in such a project.How does anyone not notice a man stopping a car with his bare hand when he pauses for a long time after he does it? Why doesn't Edward just constantly suck Bella's blood if he can do that without turning her into a vampire? Why do the vampires have to play baseball in the rain? These questions, and many more, which I can't reveal without spoiling the plot, ran through my mind throughout this film. The camera-work is awful. There are so many close-ups that you can never get a good look at anybody a lot of the time. Other times the camera just swoops and sweeps around for no reason. The narration kept on taking me out of the movie and never really matched what was going on in the plot. This film is a complete mess and I'm surprised that so many people are so obsessed with it.I actually did enjoy the movie, believe it or not, but there is no doubt in my mind that it doesn't work. This film fails to provide any sort of moral. It fails as a love story. It fails as a vampire film. It fails as a coming-of-age movie. It just doesn't work. I'm not going to bother not recommending it since you've probably already seen it anyway. I was just stating my opinion. Years from now, fans of this movie and of the books and of the films to follow will look back at this and feel ashamed. This movie is going to age like crap.",Null,5,6,22 December 2008
28 Days Later...," A Realistic Interpretation of the End of the World
","I found this film to be very good. I personally wouldn't call it a horror movie since it feels more human than that. It is very realistic, violent, well made, and evenly paced. It just sort of draws you in. It's a very good movie. I definitely recommend it if you want to see something good. The ending is a tiny bit on the sappy side, but i didn't mind that at all, even though some people probably would. It's a pretty horrifying film at times, but it manages to keep up a human feel to it that gives it more of a pure feel than other horror films.Pros: -Excellent performances -Really scary -Very Realistic -Unpredictable -Good twistsCons: -The tunnel rat scene doesn't work that well -The ending is a little weak",Null,1,2,2 January 2008
Schindler's List," The cruelest film ever made. This is the closest we will ever come to witnessing pure evil in film.
","This, to me, is the cruelest film ever made. Sure, there have been many films that have depicted cruelty in it's most realistic and most non discriminating. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL showed us a very true depiction of the holocaust. CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST showed us how far people will go to be known and to be famous. IRREVERSIBLE showed us a nine and a half minute rape scene that is nearly impossible to watch and to sit through without being forever haunted by it. SALO' OR THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM showed us pure innocence being destroyed and defiled by political right-wingers. HAPPINESS showed us how deeply depraved and how inhuman and mentally deformed some seemingly 'normal' people are. VISITOR Q depicted a family whose members indulge in the most disgusting, horrific, and depraved and don't even seem to know that what they are all doing is wrong. MONSTER was a film in which a prostitute killed her customers, not because she got a thrill out of it, but because society left her no choice. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE depicted a damaged and deranged human mind and then showed us what happens when the body that mind belongs to is no longer able to perform what the mind wants it to. PINK FLAMINGOS shows us two groups of people who act in every bad and evil activity known to mankind, knowing that it's bad and not caring. However, SCHINDLER'S LIST in my opinion, goes even further than all of those films. SCHINDLER'S LIST is a film that all of humanity should be required to watch and sit through. I refuse to watch it again. SCHINDLER'S LIST was a film that affected me so strongly and so deeply that just thinking about it frightens me. I've tried to sit through it a second time and got about halfway through, but I just couldn't handle it and I refused to finish it. SCHINDLER'S LIST is the closest we will ever come to knowing what it was like to be a part of the holocaust. It is among one of the darkest films I've ever seen in my life. The film itself is about Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi party, who owns a company and puts Jews to work in it. However, on the opposite side of the structure we meet a man named Amon Goeth. Goeth is a man who cares so little about the value of human life that he target practices with Jewish people in the Ghetto. To say that the violence in this film is unflinching isn't doing the violence enough justice. We don't watch the violent scenes as much as we full on witness it in at it's angriest and goriest. People are shot in this film. We don't see people firing a gun and then have the camera cut to people falling to the ground. We see people helplessly held at gun to the head and then shot like dogs. We see the blood shoot out very violently and graphically. We see it coat the faces of the victims and the executioners. We see many more horrific things. We see bodies blown apart, tossed aside, and broken apart. We see rotting corpses cooked and we see the remains rain from the sky. We see children get butchered and slaughtered as if their young lives were worthless and expendable. We see it all and we feel helpless. The people who do it don't see anything wrong with doing it and even make games and goofy gestures out of it. Many people will have a difficult time sitting through this film, but it remarkably watchable. As cruel and as brutal and dark and gory as it is, it is a flawless film. The film's ending makes it all worth sitting through. It remains to be one of the most moving and emotional ending in motion picture history. The final thirty minutes are so heart wrenching, honest, beautiful, and strong that it is worth enduring two hours and forty minutes of non-stop cruelty. The ending remains to be the of the great endings in motion picture history. We may not recover from the film, but what we gain from the ending alone makes it all worth defiling your mind.PROS: -Absolutely perfect performances from the entire cast and all speaking parts.-Unflinching and honest depiction of the Nazi Holocaust of the 1940s.-beautiful black & white cinematography.-A true knockout of an ending! CONS: -none",Null,9,13,8 September 2008
Grave of the Fireflies," One of the great animation classics.
","Let me put it this way. When I was five, I would wake up early every morning to watch my favorite cartoons. One night, I woke up way early than usual. It must have been around three o' clock. Anyway, I did what I usually did. I watched television. Nothing was on, so I switched it to channel 8 and laid down. There would always be weird interesting stuff on that channel that I used to love watching. A few minutes had passed with me watching whatever was on this channel ans eventually, GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES came on. At that time, I had never seen a serious animated film. The film started and there were two ghosts. I remember seeing how peaceful the whole thing seemed and feeling that it was strange that it wasn't a scary type of film. However, I probably shouldn't have assumed that it wasn't a scary film at that point. Soon after, there were terrifying scenes of destruction and chaos with people getting shot and butchered. A boy and his baby sister were caught up in it all and were desperately trying to get away. I saw these two siblings and the love and care that he had for his younger sister and immediately broke into tears. At that time, I had never seen a film where people cared about each other in such an honest and unflinching way. It was shocking to me in a way that I had seen a film that displayed so much love and desperation. The film continued and their trials became more and more horrific. By the end of the film, I could barely breathe. The film had hit me so hard in my heart that I felt wounded. I have never feared and loved a film both at the same time as much as I had for GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES. When the film was over, I fell asleep crying. When I awoke, I wondered if what I had watched was a dream. Could such a film ever even exist? I had been afraid to find out, but inside I yearned to learn more about it. Fast forward thirteen years later and I know more about it than I had when I was younger. I haven't seen it since, but I remember it as clearly as possible. I remember the music, the images, the emotion, the love, etc... I can never forget this film. Will I ever decide to pick it up and view it a second time? Absolutely. I just need to make sure that I know what I will get into if I watch it again. It's a touching piece of work and one that will go down in history as one of the most emotional and beautiful films ever made.",Null,16,17,21 May 2008
Saw II," Now this is Much more like it!
","**1/2 out of ****SAW 2, I am VERY happy to saw, is a lot better than the first go around. In a way this is really disappointing though because this was pretty much the film I was hoping the first one would be when i saw it in theaters after i read so many good reviews for it. I was very disappointed by the first film and when i saw this in theaters, i didn't read any reviews of it because i felt this film would be a long, scary, confusing, gross, and loud mess like the first one is. Well, it is long, scary, confusing, gross, and loud, like the first, but it is anything but a mess.The plot of this film is much like the first. Seven or eight people are trapped in a room inside of a big decaying house filled with very disturbing deathtraps. The people must work together to escape, but unfortunately, there is a time limit. The house is filled with a weird poison that will kill them very soon.There is much more to the story than just this simple plot line. There are flashbacks throughout the film which was really distracting in the first film but much more fleshed out and organized.The 'Jigsaw' killer's identity is explored much more and adds solidly to the plot. His character is developed very well and he doesn't feel like a plot device like he did in the first film.The characters are much more likable compared to the everlasting crybabies in the first film, but not likable enough to have you crying when one of them is killed, which many of them will be.The gore is extremely repugnant and revolting, but, again, it is added to be integral and flesh out the nature of the film more. There is at least one scene to me that, while i successfully sat through it, was very hard to swallow and made me want to look away. It worked though.The film's ending is, again, a twist. But it isn't the kind of twist that will give you nightmares, like the first one did, instead its the kind of ending that gives you a really good accomplished feeling. You feel good when it happens.This film, despite being a sequel, manages to be better, stronger, gorier, scarier, and even funnier than the original. This gives me great hope in this growing series. Looks like it might just have a chance at being a pretty solid horror film trilogy like SCREAM and not like Friday THE 13th. I have great faith in the SAW series and i look forward to seeing the next in this series.Rated R for grisly violence and gore, terror, language and drug content.",Null,0,0,16 February 2006
From Dusk Till Dawn," Well Made Action Film
","**1/2 out of ****Now here is a cool idea. A film with a Quentin Tarantino plot and Robert Rodriguez action. It makes you almost believe that it could be twice as good as PULP FICTION (1994) and DESPERADO (1995). And it is, kind of.The plot is relatively complicated. Two brothers, Seth (George Clooney, who does very well here) and Richie (Director Quentin Tarantino who is just plain scary in this film) are on a crime spree(NATURAL BORN KILLERS should ring a bell)and kidnap a priest and his two children. They drive to Mexico and find a biker joint, whose residents cause quite a damper on their evening. The second half of the film is pure action and mayhem at its loudest and its most explosive.Here is the problem with this film. It feels like two completely different films in one. The first half of the film is just like another QT classic. It has all the plot, over the top action, and intelligent script. It is a really great road movie. But then, the halfway mark approaches. The film turns from cool to Wacked Out. We no longer have the cool dialog and neat characters. Now we have a film, somewhat like a horror film, that is too quick, too strange, too random, and too action packed for us to care about anything other than what neat special effect they have next, or, who is going to survive. Kind of like a Rodreguez film.Still, if you are looking for a really fun movie full of action, adventure, laughs, and horror, this should suit you fine. If you are just in it for the Quintin Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez stuff, you might be disappointed. I enjoyed this film a lot. But I was kind of hoping it would be a lot more organized.Watch for Selma Hayak is a small but unbelievably sexy role. The film is worth watching just for her.Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity.",Null,0,1,24 September 2005
The Dark Knight," A Magnificent Superhero film, crime film, ensemble piece, and all around great film
","This film was incredible. It was two hours and thirty minutes, but it felt half as short. I loved every minute of it. It was gripping, shocking, moving, funny, and clever. Christian Bale took his strange persona he had in BATMAN BEGINS and ratcheted it up a notch and a half. I can't imagine a better Batman. Maggie Gyllenhaal did an even better job than Katie Holmes did and managed to make me forget that she was Maggie Gyllenhaal. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman were all top notch as they usually are. Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker was absolutely chilling and incredible. He was like a deranged combination of Jack Nicholson, Cesar Romero, Brandon Lee in THE CROW, Malcolm McDowell as Alex DeLarge in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and Tadanobu Asano as Kakihara in ICHI THE KILLER. I'd say that his performance was worth an Oscar, except that Aaron Eckhart as Harvy Dent was just as incredible. I don't want to spoil anything, but his performance will most certainly be remembered as one of the most emotional and unforgettable performances in a superhero film. He does just as good a job as Heath Ledger, who already did an immense and perfect job. I hate to call the film a superhero movie though, because it is much much MUCH more than that. It is an ensemble piece. This film is just as much about Batman as it is about Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Dent. All three characters are explored to such an incredible depth that it doesn't feel at all like a superhero movie. That's not to say that the film doesn't have it's fair share of action, because the action scenes in this film are extraordinary. The actions scenes in this film are not only satisfying, but they are also incredibly intense, unpredictable, and, they actually move the story. As if the film isn't perfect enough, it also manages to accomplish even more. The film feels like a crime saga in the vein of something like THE UNTOUCHABLES, THE DEPARTED, and, yes, even THE CROW. This is a magnificent film and a gem and it deserves to be remembered as a milestone in the realm of great superhero movies. This is a great film and I highly recommend it.PROS:-everything that was great about the original is multiplied.-extraordinary performances by Aaron Eckhart, Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Heath Ledger-perfect visuals, action scenes, fast pace, and storyCONS:-Obviously, some suspension of disbelief is definitely required for a superhero movie.",Null,3,6,20 July 2008
Into the Wild," This film is fantastic
","As much as I want to, I don't want to say exactly what makes this film wonderful to me. It's tough, but I can only say that it is perfect in a way that I can't explain. INTO THE WILD is the kind of film I just want to cherish and admire and keep to myself all at the same time. It's the kind of film that really just gets me in a much more personal way than usual. It's the kind of film that I don't want to just spend time praising for fear that it may lose effect just from thinking about how good it is. It's the kind of film that I only want to share with people who are close to me. I loved this story about a guy who decides to escape from it all just so that he can be one with the world.

2001: A Space Odyssey," Brilliant.
","Since this film is partly about the idea of how technology can gain control of us if we aren't careful, expect it to be grim. However, being that there is so much to absorb, the lesson seems less heavy handed than you'd expect. When you watch this film, leave your expectations at the door. This isn't the sort of film that you can expect anything from except pure imagination and wonder. This film not only shows us the accomplishments, the troubles, the dilemmas, and the wondrous beauty of man, but also gives you an experience unlike any other. The film is mostly without much talking, which actually helps the audience absorb what is going on. This film also provides some true horror as the results of letting technology get ahead of us destroys the future of human kind. Just see it. It's wondrous.",Null,1,7,24 April 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A great Science fiction film, but also one of the most realistic love stories I've seen!
","'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a film full of unique ideas, characters, situations, and philosophy. It is one of the most alive films I've ever seen. It's a film so full of life and love and graceful quality. It is a film that is as ripe and as fresh as any of the best romantic comedies. It is, at times, incredibly funny. At other times, it's just simply heartbreaking. It doesn't matter if you've been in love or not, because you will get something personal out of this movie.The film basically is about the human desire to want to erase unpleasant memories. In the case of this film, it is Joel Barish(Jim Carrey) who wants to annihilate the horrible memories of his ex-girlfriend, Clemintine(Kate Winslet). The film takes this premise to it's highest potential by placing the viewer in the mind of Joel as his memories are being wiped out. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play their parts as perfectly as any on-screen couple has. While most of their scenes together are harrowing and unpleasant, they are full of truth and clarity. Jim Carrey has that subtle pacing of how to react to things in a nondiscriminatory way while Kate Winslet comes across as more authentic and blunt as she can be without going over-the-top. They both do fantastic. The bulk of the film takes place in Joel's mind, as a matter-of-fact, and while this premise may sound like it is stretching credibility it still manages to achieve that rare feeling of nostalgia, chance, and hopefulness that we all have in our lives. The idea of losing these sorts of memories is a terrifying idea, but Michel Gondry, the director of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, knows this and has strategically added a serious flaw in the film, not to make the film weaker, but to make the film funnier. Enter Patrick, Mary, and Stan, three people whose job it is to do the mind erasing. Throughout the course of the film, the character of Joel repeatedly regrets going through with the procedure and tries to escape the brainwashing. This causes these three people who are working on him to encounter technical problems with their equipment and even causes Joel to enter into a waking life state in which he is wide awake but his brain is completely asleep while his mind is being fried. The problem with this is that it is only natural for someone to regret this sort of procedure while it's happening, so these three people should be used to doing this. Michel Gondry knows this and he knows that the audience knows this because he adds in a level of self-parody on top of all the mayhem. This is such a risky think for a director to try and pull off. Add to that the fact that the film is in non-chronological order, the character choice of Clementine getting her brain erased first, and a borderline manic subplot involving a secret love affair between two of the doctors and a love affair with of the doctors and Clementine and you have yourself a very complicated sounding film. If you haven't seen the film yet, what I am telling you will go right over your head. Trust me when I say that this film is a lot easier to swallow than I'm making it sound. All of these elements are developed and played out very carefully and delicately, but not to the point where any of it becomes second nature. This is a real work of art. It is Michel Gondry's masterpiece, no question. The screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, as usual, is beautiful in it's simplicity. Michel Gondry really brought it to life though, and that is something of a miracle. Michel Gondry has the mind of a child. He's so full of life and love and his mind is so open to infinite possibilities. He has taken all of that, and, with the writing of Charlie Kaufman, crafted this beautiful and touching masterpiece of film-making, and I can't thank them enough for making it.",Null,1,2,25 January 2009
Saw," Clichéd Script and Unlikable Characters Sink this Un-scary Film
","*1/2 out of **** Two men, a doctor and a photographer, wake up in the most disgusting bathroom in a dank underground Cavern. They are chained to the wall and have mad the gross discovery of finding a dead body in the room with them. They soon find out that they have been kidnapped and have to play a game in which the doctor must kill the photographer or the kidnapper will kill his wife and child. Soon they begin to collect clues and information about each other, but will they be able to escape, not only with their lives, but with the doctor's family's? The concept of this film is scary. The ideas are somewhat clever. Unfortunitely, those two things are the only things that are able to carry this film. And thankfully, they carry them a long way, but not through to the end, sadly.This could have been forgivable if we were to care about the characters, but we can't. These kind of films should have more character development, but instead, SAW pushes that aside and layers the film with buckets of blood and guts, neither of which particularly grossed me out since we, again, could care less about the characters, especially the photographer(Leigh Whannell) who goes over the top to make the viewers surprised that the doctor(Cary Elwes) doesn't immediately murder him.Speaking of which, the normally brilliant Cary Elwes doesn't do well here. He begins too wooden and then tries to be emotional and then gets even more wooden and it just doesn't work. However, I understand that if an actor is British and must switch to doing an American accent, it won't be easy. It wasn't easy for him, and it won't be easy on the audience when he begins doing unrealistic whining noises as he and Leigh are getting chopped to pieces! What wreaks the film the most are the amount of flashbacks that occur nonstop and detract from the plot. The film could have been a good grisly time, despite the flaws, if it just centered on the one room that the two men are tortured in. The flashbacks are annoying and feel like an excuse to just talk about the killer and his sick ways, which eventually accidentally turn themselves into plot devices.However, the film, despite being really bad, has good points. The plot is intriguing, and the violent torture acts are great fun for gore fans. At one point, a woman forces herself to cut open a man's stomach and find a key to unlock the door in his intestines. And the last fifteen minutes of the film is a create montage of disturbing insanity and depravity that I must recommend to those who like sick stuff. And the twist ending works great and really ends the film with a disgusting BANG!!! The bad out weighs the good this time, but for those looking for a lot of grisly violence will have a good time here. The film manages to just about deliver the gore, but the film has a long way to go to being as good and gory as SEVEN or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I hope they get it right next time.Rated R for strong grisly violence and language",Null,2,2,13 February 2006
A Clockwork Orange," Twisted, Sick, and Extremely Violent, This film is a seductive, beautiful and Brillaintly acted Masterpiece.
","This Kubrick film is quite special due to it's ideas involving what could happen when man ceases to be a man due to his inability to make a choice. Then he becomes an animal, incapable of making a choice and only holding on to his survival. This film takes this idea to it's extreme. It's disturbing to see the human form be reconstructed in such a way, and yet there is something disturbingly satisfying about actually seeing bad come out of this sort of situation. When it happens to somebody who only wants to hurt people, does that make it justified? This issue is still just as relevant, if not more, relevant today. So this film is not at all dated, and in fact is still ahead of it's time despite being made in 1971. I believe that this and FULL METAL JACKET are Kubrick's two most relevant films, but especially this. I simply cannot imagine this film not existing. It's perfect.",Null,2,4,30 November 2005
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," A Well Made Film, but it's Very Redundant and inaccurate.
","*** out of ****At first I didn't think too kindly of this film. I thought it wasn't done in a very managed and interesting way. I felt that even though thepoint that it made was well done, I just didn't understand the shock of it. It didn't have any marginal impact and i thought that if it was more restrained, it would have worked better. But I have viewed the film several times since I first saw it and I now appreciate it for what it is.This film was made by the brilliant Pier Paolo Pasolini and was based on the extremely sick novel by Marque De Sade, THE 120 DAYS OF SODEM. In Northern Italy, eight young boys and girls are captured by strange people. They are subjected to torture and mutilation. The boys and girls are graphically raped and beaten. They are force fed feces and are sexually abused and injured. Eventually the less satisfying ones are butchered.It is depressing, and it is truly horrible to watch these innocent children exploited and destroyed. Their humiliation is as realistic and as strong as it can be. The film, when not showing sexual organs, feces, or gory nastiness, is beautiful. The parts in between all the weird and dreadful things were the parts i looked for in this film. They are far and few in between, but they are there.I felt that the era of that time in Fascist Italy was accurately and realistically portrayed and was quite an interesting setting. The children are treated like sex objects and voodoo dolls. The scene where feces is consumed is ghastly, yes, but it wallows in excess so much that the viewer is more effected by it as they would normally be. The buildup to the end is quite intense, as are the quiet moments of horror.As for the setting, I am a socialist and i have always wanted to learn about different kinds of eras in places like Germany, France, China, and Italy. This film's depictions on Fascism in Italy are surreal. The film is very much worth seeing. It has a certain style,or lack of, that makes the film feel like something very special.The thing i didn't like about it the first time was that it didn't have an honest effect on me. I watched it, but not with an open mind. I only watched it because i was a fan of the director and thought to be impressed by the visuals and the story. Alas, this is different from his usual stuff in that the sexual content is not existent. There is only violence being done by human beings to other human beings. These are the kind of people who live like animals. They have no regrets, no feelings, no emotion, and no ability to choose anything other than what they want. That is why it is so hard to watch. An animal in some ways is better than a human because it does exactly what it is supposed to do and nothing else. The idea that a human can choose to live like an animal is wrong and inhumane.The film doesn't exist just to be a shock film. It exists because the idea based around it and the concept of human hurting other humans is an easy story to craft, but it is hard to explore. I feel that the two films that do this the best are this film, SALO', and the 2003 Gus Van Sant film, ELEPHANT. In both films, we are presented with ideas as to why a human would want to hurt another human, but these films explore this idea with an open mind and an honest fearlessness to it. It doesn't matter that somebody chooses to hurt another human. The real question is, is that what they think they are supposed to be doing?not rated but contains explicit violence, torture, and rape.",Null,2,7,15 September 2005
Eyes Wide Shut," Stanley Kubrick's Final film is, Ironically, the Only One of His That I Didn't Love.
","** out of ****Stanley Kubrick's final film is a sexual thriller about a couple who grow apart due to one admitting lusting after a man that neither she had ever met. Her husband goes mad with jealousy and dashes out into the decrepit streets of what appears to be New York, looking for sexual escapism. When he gets involved with a sketchy sexual cult of some sort, he realizes that he is way over his head and must find the effort to go back to his loving wife and try to patch things up, or to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.Being that I'm not a big fan of either Tom Cruise or Nicole Kidman, I'm not totally surprised that I didn't like this film. But I felt that they did a fine job in this film, so it's not because of them that i don't like it. the reason i didn't like it was because i didn't find the plot to be either very interesting or particularly believable at all. I love thrillers, but for a thriller, this film doesn't work too well at establishing any sort of immediate danger. There are moments of threatening toward a separate character, but all the danger takes place off screen.I did, however, love the production design and the musical score. These are aspects of film that Kubrick has always been able to master, however, and it shouldn't really come as a surprise. It just concerns the film as to whether all this beauty was right for this kind of film. Personally, I would have rather had the film not have so much beauty since this is a rather dark and ugly story the film is telling. It just feels out of place.Overall, despite it being a disappointment for myself, I'd still recommend the film to fans of his, or to fans of sexual thrillers. I would not, however, recommend this film to fans of Tom Cruise or Nicole Kidman, unless you will still love them even when they are being total douche bags to each other.Rated R for strong sexual content, nudity, language and some drug-related material.",Null,1,4,2 September 2007
Pulp Fiction," The best thing to come out of a million grindhouse exploitation films besides entertainment!
","The plot is a little more complicated than usual. The film opens with a couple played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plumber excellently by the way. In fact, there is not a single slacker in the whole film. Soon the viewer begins to realize these two people are up to no good. Then the film cuts to two hit men (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) who are on their way to extract money that a group of college kids owe their boss. Soon, more characters are added to the growing storyline and the intensity level is heightened.The sequences in this film are out of order. This is actually a good thing because the director, Quentin Tarantino(KILL BILL, JACKIE BROWN) doesn't want to show you that part of the story or that character yet. By doing this he is able to take the opportunity to continuously provide a consistent tone and level of humor while at the same time shocking us with unexpected graphic violence. I found this approach to be very stylish and effective in creating genuine emotion.The soundtrack perfectly complements the character's mindsets and the mood of the film. The end result makes for some really very memorable scenes throughout. While the film is basically a crime comedy, the music, in addition to the context of the scenes and the dialogue, are full of personality and classiness. This film is that it isn't for every taste. Sure there are things in this film that any open-minded viewer can admire about it, but the film is very over the top in it's scenes of graphic violence. One scene in particular is a grotesque nod to DELIVERENCE. This film is not for the squeamish. This is the kind of film that can be watched over and over and will always be exciting and fulfilling until the end. It's a modern classic. It's entertaining, brutal, funny, and unforgettable. It's a true classic that has inspired many many films and yet still manages to be just as entertaining as it was in 1994.

Mystic River," This horrible film hits harder than a hammer to the forehead. Definitely a shattering experience.
","Clint Eastwood has crafted a truly sinister masterpiece. What he has done here is that he not only took the time to develop a very involving and emotional film about childhood trauma and how it can truly screw up a person's life, but has also made a very engaging murder mystery with a lot of horror, suspense, and great dialogue. This is a film, not only about friendship and loyalty, but also paranoia, love, suspicion, and the perils of vigilante justice. The story just draws the viewer in like a good novel. The viewer just doesn't know how the story will play out and what kind of direction it will go in. As a result, when the characters really start showing what they are capable of, the viewer will be shocked by the outcome of it all. The ending to the film will most likely get to many viewers. In truth, it made me want to rip my hair out by the sickening nature of it. However, the viewer should have been aware that it wasn't going to be a pleasant film watching experience from the beginning. Sure, the result of the story is upsetting and gross, but at least it didn't lie to us. It is an honest, effective, and thought provoking film. It's one of the most uncommonly effective films I've seen in years. When I think about how all these characters came to such a conclusion, I understood what the purpose of it all was. In return for watching this, I was told a great story that was involving and unfolded in a really unique way.",Null,1,2,27 April 2008

","ORIGINALLY POSTED: 29 June 2009Let me put it to you this way. If all you want to watch two robots fighting each other, you will not like this film. What you will experience instead are the following; Giant robot testicles, John Turturro's scrotum and buttocks, two dogs humping nonstop, robots humping humans, non-stop close-ups of Megan Fox's clothed private parts, a giant robot penis, endless amounts of sex jokes in general, robot heaven, robot black racist stereotypes, conspiracy theorist stereotypes, a mentally handicapped college professor compare himself to god, a woman going crazy from exposure to marijuana, two second transportation across the world over and over, a girl speed racing to Washington from LA, a guy not caring that a robot has saved his life constantly, characters getting killed and then magically being alive again, obnoxious and annoying subplots involving human characters that we couldn't possibly even begin to care about, pretentious and shameless Michael Bay advertisements for his other work, lots of falling wheels, lots of falling cars, lots of falling cogs, lots of falling bolts, lots of falling pieces of random scrap metal that breaks apart far too easily, lots of people not caring that giant robots are fighting in the middle of the city, lots of really bad dialogue, lots of confusing gray colored robots with no discernible features, endless amounts of plot holes, endless amounts of scenes of characters pointing out plot holes and then being shut up, and NO PLOT. There is nothing here. Not even the fight scenes manage to satisfy. It's all just a lot of endless noise and machinery flying all over the place for no reason!

There Will Be Blood," A true vision of hell
","People will rave about Daniel Day-Lewis's performance. Indeed, it is one of the greatest performances of the past year. However there's a lot more about this film that is fascinating and great than just the acting. It is certainly one of the best things about the film, but it's difficult to describe how it works and why it works well. The film is simply powerful in it's subtly and it's vision of the early 20th century America. The idea of oil drillers and petroleum operators is, in itself, fascinating. The film uses these ideas and works them through the character of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day-Lewis). Daniel is a man, destroyed by hard work and closed mindedness, who has a son, HW, who doesn't even belong to him and who is is seriously deranged by the utter aimless direction that his life is slowing heading toward. Sure, he has the ability to become prosperous in business and in wealth, but it will never truly change him or help him. He is a man who is already lost in his extremes. Enter Eli Sunday(Paul Dano), a bible thumping, arrogant, and greedy person that Daniel Plainview despises. Daniel hates people who use religion to make money and to not accept responsibility for their actions. Eli Sunday's money making religious scam business is more successful than Daniel's oil drilling business, despite how they don't appear to work as hard as he or his men do. Both Eli and Daniel are bad people. Daniel is bad because he is a mess of a man who, despite being successful and smart, is a liar and does 't think twice. Eli is bad because, although he is also successful, he is arrogant, loud, annoying, and doesn't seem to realize who Daniel is. The film is about how these two men are able to exploit each other and cause the downfalls of each of their businesses. This is a film that truly says something about how confused the human spirit can get under the most bizarre circumstances. The two characters do end up completely losing it, but this isn't a surprise to anyone. When I first saw the film, I criticized it for the last third, which I felt went too far in it's grotesque nature. After seeing it a third time, I understand now that the last third of the film is perfect for the rest of the film. I knew that the two characters would be descending into madness, I just didn't expect it to be so extreme as it is in this film. The last third part of this film works because the audience has a sense of impeding dread from the very start. This is why the music by Johnny Greenwood in the film works so well, because it drones and sounds very industrial. At the beginning it's distracting, but you get used to it because, in a sense, it's like the soundtrack to hell. I don't believe in the afterlife in general, but if hell did exist then the world of this film would probably be like what it is like. As extreme as the film sounds, it is not because of the content. People going into this expecting a lot of blood and murder are going to be shocked that most of the violence is limited to the last third and they will most likely leave before them. What makes this film so extreme is how indiscriminate the character of Daniel Plainview is in the people he hates. He doesn't hate them to a certain extent or is mildly annoyed by them, he hates them all about as much as a human being can hate another human being. It is in this that drives the character down. These characters are bad people. Watching this film is like watching two hours of a big, beautiful, vast world being created and then seeing every single part of it get destroyed and set aflame in thirty minutes time. Daniel Day-Lewis does such a fantastic job. His character is so complicated and horrific and somehow he gets to a point where he can do whatever he wants. Daniel Day-Lewis goes off into his own little sick world in this and I will be very surprised if he is able to recover from it. Paul Dano is a good contender to go head-to-head with Day-Lewis in who can be the crazier character. It's a brutal ride, but it's accelerating and, above all, brilliant. This film took me into a fascinating and horrific world and I loved every minute of it. Truly a fantastic accomplishment.SPOILERS: One thing I need to mention, however, is the ending. Many people have criticized the ending for it's grim and bizarre turn of events. Basically, it ends with Daniel Plainview finally having enough of Eli Sunday's lies and manipulation and beats his head to a bloody mess with a bowling pin. Daniel's butler comes down sometime later only to discover the bloody mess, with Daniel sitting by it. Daniel then turns around and says, 'I'm finished.' CUT TO HAPPY MUSIC. The obvious purpose of this ending is to show that Daniel is left with nothing. Of the two men, one could argue that Eli loses more, but the only thing Daniel doesn't lose is his life. He is dead in every way possible. The only way for him to conform to that is to make Eli be actually dead. I found it to be powerful, shocking, and very unique. It sure wasn't a pleasing way for a film to end. There isn't any real closure, but there isn't always a meaning behind everything in life. END SPOILERSPROS:-Perfect performance by Daniel Day-Lewis-Beautiful look-Excellent attention to detail-Marvelous opening sceneCONS:-The music may be annoying for many viewers-The final turn of events is off-putting, to say the least",Null,2,9,4 March 2008
The Wrestler," The best film of 2008
","Randy the Ram is a famous wrestler who has been involved in the sport of professional wrestling for several decades. Wrestling has taken it's toll on his body. With the combination of injury, drug use, and over-exertion, Randy's body has deteriorated over the years to the point where he can no longer wrestle according to the doctor's orders. Left with nothing to do, Randy decides to get his work hours extended at the local deli, tries to get closer to his best friend, Cassidy, who is a stripper, and decides to try and repair his bad relationship with his daughter, Stephanie. However, living in the real world may be too daunting a task for Randy. Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler is an uncompromising vision of life. We don't just see the downfall of Randy as much as we witness it. We see him backstage with his wrestling partners and we see them as very close and more comfortable with each other and knowledgeable of each other's bodies and their fighting styles. Then we see Randy and Cassidy and we see the juxtaposing of the wrestling lifestyle and the stripper lifestyle and we see how strangely similar they are. They both are entertainers and their bodies are the entertainment. We see Randy work at the deli and he has the same high energy and forceful nature that he does in the ring. We see Randy with his daughter and what we see looks like a bad train wreck. We don't see any relation, any chemistry, or anything in common with these two people. These are two completely different people. Randy is a mass of muscles, greasy hair, and large clothes. Stephanie is beautiful, young, smart, and it is suggested that she is a homosexual. As the film goes along, we see all these common elements of Randy's life completely fall apart. We slowly come to the realization that he needs to wrestle in order for him to be able to manage his life. Randy is an entertainer and he was born to entertain. Unlike Cassidy, however, he goes to extreme lengths to entertain. He allows his body to be ripped to shreds. As part of the world of wrestling, he must hide razor blades in his wrist straps in order for him to take it out and slash his face. We see him get nearly ripped open with barbed wire on one scene. The gory scenes in The Wrestler could rival the endless scenes of mutilation in The Passion of the Christ, which is even referenced in one scene by the Cassidy character. The second half of the film is extremely intense in it's unfolding of events. While we know that Randy is not able to function that well outside of wrestling, his lack of order, structure, and discipline soon takes an even bigger toll on him than the injuries he gets in the ring. His fall from grace is difficult to watch in it's honesty and the film is unsparing in it's distraught nature. There is no time for the audience to breathe. We witness the battle and, when it ends, we aren't fully sure if it was worth it. It doesn't matter though, because what we saw was exactly what a good film should be. The Wrestler is a fascinating and harrowing piece of film-making. Micky Rourke practically plays himself and it is a fearless piece of acting. Marisa Tomei and Even Rachel Wood both come off just as strong. The film is so fascinating to watch. We feel privileged to see this life that is so different from our own. We are shown sides of people that we would never never see, not even if they were our brothers or sisters. The attention to detail and the gritty camera-work only add to the authentic feel. The soundtrack is incredibly memorable and fits so well with the character of Randy. All of these elements lead up to an ending that, I think, is one of the year's best. While many people will hate the ending to this film, many will also love it. It's the kind of ending that rings so true and has so much power in it's hard hitting nature. I felt happier at the end of this film than I did to the ending of any big budget Hollywood Blockbuster. The Wrestler is a one-of-a-kind masterpiece and it is the best film of 2008.",Null,2,4,25 January 2009
The Silence of the Lambs," The first film that ever made me puke
","This film is the most bad-ass movie I have ever seen. Everything about it is so good. You have the scene in which Buffalo Bill pretends to be handicapped and the victim is nice enough to try to help him before he knocks her out and checks her bra size or whatever and says in that creepy low pitch voice, 'Mmm, perfect...' You have the classic escape scene in which one guy gets in in the face with some mace, that was pretty gruesome. You have the scene when Buffalo bill does some hardcore crotch folding action. You have the scene where his victim kidnaps his poodle. This film also has a scene in which I puked in which Jodie Foster is outside the bathroom door and busts in only to find the skinned corpse of a girl in the bathtub that has noticeably been there for years, before the lights go out. I almost passed out when I saw that. That was a true gross-out horror movie moment. This film is truly a suspenseful and perfect film that will be remembered as one of the most twisted serial killer films ever. This is a classic!Pros: -Brilliant acting from Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins especially.-shocking suspense -breathtaking script -horrific and brilliantly done brutality and gross out scenes Cons: -none",Null,1,1,4 July 2008
300," I wasn't a big fan. I couldn't take it seriously.
","I thought the film looked pretty. Real pretty. It had the look of a video game. The look of the film is what makes it good in my book. However, other than that, there isn't much else. The film has pretty good acting and a pretty cool story based on the legend of the 300 Spartans versus the Persians. However, the cheesiness of the whole thing got in the way and the film just doesn't really recover from it. The crazy images and the over the top logic just made me almost pee my pants in the theater. It is a hilarious movie. I couldn't stop laughing. It was great. There were closeups of people grunting and growling in some of the weirdest ways. A lot of the characters acted so goofy that it was impossible for me to take them seriously. All of the warriors had six packs and eight packs, even the wicked thin dudes. The two parts that made me laugh the hardest were when the guy is pushed down the conveniently located endless pit, and when Xerxes appeared for the first time or as i like to call him, The Human Chandelier. He had so many ridiculous looking rings in his face that i could barely look at him without cracking up! And his voice!!! He sounded like a robot!!! He was weird looking. And then when that guy appeared with the buzz saws for arms, i just couldn't take it anymore. It was too ridiculous to be good. If you want to see a film that ensures nonstop laughter, I highly recommend 300.",Null,3,4,11 October 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," The most uplifting film of the year.
","This is the story of the journey of a boy becoming a man and what he will do to prove his love to the woman of his dreams. He gets on Who Wants to be a Millionaire, a show that she is fond of, and tries to win the top prize in rupees. His journey is not without a lot of pain and a lot of challenges. This was a surprisingly uplifting and beautiful film, which is a surprise considering how dark and intense it is in the earlier scenes in the film. While the film does have a lot of style in terms of music and color, the camera never stops moving. It is always very shaky and always cutting away. This helps to establish how intense the situations in the film are. The characters are all clearly defined and given a lot of personality and quality. Even the most minor of the characters are given plenty to work with. The film just bursts with life and with beauty and innocence and emotion. There are scenes of incredible clarity and power. This is, by far, Danny Boyle's most ambitious film yet! It's certainly not his best(in my opinion that would by Trainspotting) but it's one of his better films. It's easily the most accessible and the most enjoyable for most audiences. It's probably his most mainstream film. I have a feeling that this film was what he wanted A Life Less Ordinary to be like but at the time didn't have the money or ability to pull it off. Slumdog Millionaire is a success and it is a good movie. There are flaws, don't get me wrong. Some of the music doesn't work, the middle section of the film is surprisingly weak and confusing, there are too many unnecessary chase scenes and fight scenes, one of the characters does some really extreme things that seem out of the ordinary, and the film's editing can be to abrasive at times. Still, this film is fun, it's entertaining, and it's uplifting. This is the 'feel good' movie of the year. See it, not because you want to but because you deserve to.",Null,3,6,22 December 2008
Princess Mononoke," A brilliant work of love, fantasy, and adult animation.
","Can an animated film get any better? The only other Japanese animated films I can think of that I love just as much as this are GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES, AKIRA, SPIRITED AWAY, and GHOST IN THE SHELL. PRINCESS MONONOKE is perfection. The film is simply flawless in it's storytelling, it's animation, it's characters, and it's emotion. The film is about a boy who is cursed with a sickness that will kill him but, at the same time, gives him superhuman abilities. He ventures out of his hometown to find a cure. In the process of finding a cure, he is caught in the middle of a war between animals and humans and gets involved by the leader of the animals, a human female named Princess Mononoke. The film is an epic work of fantasy. Out of all the Fantasy films I've seen in my time, this is probably my favorite. There is so much imagination at work here with the characters and the action. At times things become overwhelming due to the epic scale and the emotion evoked in the storyline and the action. Some of the images in this film are so strange and indescribable that I can easily recommend it on the note that there are sights that you will never see anywhere else, but I don't want to make it sound like a freak show. What makes the film's bizarre images even greater is how the strength of the animation alone can carry it along with the plot in such a elegant and masterful way. It's wondrous when a person can create such images full of beauty and bizarre otherworldliness. I always love when filmmakers do that. The fact that this is animated allows these images to absorb the viewer in much simpler and extraordinary ways. At times the film is so astonishing in how it's able to carry this stuff that it is emotional. I love the film because it reminds me that the human race is capable of creating the most astonishing things. I love the human race, and it's because of films like these.",Null,2,4,21 May 2008
