It," Brilliant!
","I love the fact that they made the whole youth portion into the entire first movie. The second one will be the adults part. Absolutely brilliant. As for the movie itself, very very atmospheric and the scenography is great. Score and cast deliver in every way.I've loved the Stephen King novel since the late 80's.And the first mini series scared the hell out of me.This movie took a excellent spin on the already solidified universe.I just hope more reviewers realise that it's a 2 part movie and don't get too upset thinking the creators skipped the whole adult part. Patience, friends, it will come.9/10",9,0,0,13 January 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Legacy.
","Star Wars has been through one heck of an ride over the decades. It has gone from underground nerdom to global phenomenon. From merchandise cashgrab to labor of love and back to merchandise cashgrab, to social confusion.The original trilogy will always stay treasured and loved. The prequel's upset the more diehard fans but opened Star Wars to the masses in ways no-one would have anticipated, and the prequels are suddenly loved even by the diehard fans that as previously stated had issues with them, because of the nosedive the new films did (episode 7 and 8.)I wasn't alone in feeling a sense of death of a franchise we all loved.Then Rogue One was announced.Somber wait.It released, and we went to see it.It revived my love for Star Wars all over again. What an absolute gem of a movie, made with love and it shows.A epic tale, set right before A New Hope.If you haven't seen it, maybe because of fear that it would be yet another Star Wars movie that hammers the proverbial nail of sadness into the coffin? Don't fret, don't be afraid. The movie is amazing. Cast, acting, score, atmosphere, they nail it all, it feels 'Star Wars' right to the bone.",9,5,7,29 December 2018
