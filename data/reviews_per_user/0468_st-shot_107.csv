The Devil's Advocate," The Devil's Advocate takes its time burning out.
","Not that he needed to but Taylor Hackford more than confirms he is no Roman Polanski in this slick modern day Gothic horror that in the course of its healthy running time (144 minutes) becomes one to endure. Poorly paced, over and under acted this slick looking bore grows more incredulous with each reel as the characters lose steam with Hackford desperately tries to inject some shock value ( a demented Charlize Theron going topless in a church being one of his grander flourishes) into this supernatural snorer.Florida counselor Kevin Lomax has all the tools to make him a superb defense lawyer. When he gets the call to go to work for a firm in the majors he jumps at it. Moving to the Big Apple he joins the firm of John Milton (Al Pacino) whose piercing intensity Lomax finds both motivating and intimidating. He begins to prove himself fast and is given some big assignments over senior staff. Career wise things are going great but at home wife Mary Ann (Theron) is starting to deconstruct and there is strong suspicion Milton has something to do with it.With the wooden Reaves in the lead Advocate is sore in need of one as he feigns confusion at the most obvious of ploys put forth by the evil Milton. For a guy that's supposed to be a sharp lawyer he spends an awful amount of the films running time oblivious to Hackford's heavy handed red flags. Pacino's sartorially attired Beelzebub is all wide eyed sadist and smugness with runway models replacing Gog and Magog as companions. Oozing unctuous charm and calm he toys with Lomax longer than a cat with a chipmunk and it's just about as entertaining. Theron fairs the best among the leads by tamping down her share of the hysteria but by the time Devil's Advocate arrives at its climax it has already gone to hell.",5,1,6,3 June 2011
The King's Speech," Sometimes it ain't so great to be king.
","With Hitler about to throw the world into chaos and his elder brother and first in line for the throne of England shirking his duties to slavishly chase of all things a twice divorced, well traveled American, the future King of England, George VI (Colin Firth) is about to have the awesome weight of leading Great Britain in its most dire hour thrust upon him. Cursed with a stammer since the age of four he is ill equipped to do so in the age of the wireless but duty demands it and his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) desperately seeks a cure. Literally and figuratively making her way through a London fog she engages the help of an Australian (Geoffrey Rush) speech therapist who employs unorthodox methodology. Reluctantly the future king acquiesces to treatment but it's a bumpy ride all the way.The King's Speech is a gripping historical film that deals with the fate of the world in drawing room drama fashion. The conflagration that will engulf all of Europe has yet to begin but we are all aware of what's next and the pressure and frustration of awesome responsibility worn on the face and in the stuttering cadence of the future king is as tense as any panoramic battle scene.Director Tom Hooper does an excellent job of staying on point without letting Speech becoming too dependent on dialogue. Camera movement and editing give the film the energy George by virtue of his handicap of fits and starts cannot. Remaining faithful to history he gives brief but effective glimpses of the major players ( George V, Baldwin , Churchill, Queen Mary ) of the day economically conveying the strain of duty over self. In addition Barry Cohen's cinematography deftly compliments the sober mood with muted canvases, making the most of the few exteriors with some dazzling pertinent imagery without calling attention to itself.The supporting cast of Bonham Carter, Derek Jacobi, Guy Pearce Michael Gambon and Claire Bloom among others are uniformly precise while Geoffrey Rush's speech therapist displaying a flawed confidence with a hint of vanity is an excellent foil and counterbalance in scene after scene with the frazzled heir to the throne. It is Colin Firth's towering performance as 'Bertie' though that gives The King's Speech it's voice. He may be royalty but he is also nothing but a man hobbled by a crippling defect and Firth conveys it with magnificent nuance. Ill fitted to deal with greatness in its three forms 'Bertie' is both sympathetic and a prig. Waylaid as he is by his malady he is fully aware of his station in life and Firth is equally adept at being cruel and condescending within that vulnerability. Suffice to say Mr. Firth will soon be in need of a much larger mantelpiece at home as well as being addressed differently in the future for a career paved with standout performances with this arguably his finest hour.",8,3,6,6 January 2011
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Second verse same as the first but worse.
","King of high cinema kitsch Quentin Tarantino's second installment of things I stole from Sergio Leone and Bruce Lee and tarted up with a big budget is amazingly even worse than his first act of cannibalism. There's the same torpid pace, solemn goof ball rhetoric and the endless close-ups of bug eyed Uma Thurman looking determined all painted in three coats of red. And if the last one wasn't slow enough there's an extra twenty minutes on this one to put you into an even deeper sleep. It's Slower Pussycat, Bore, Bore.Ah, yes the plot. Somewhere in a parallel universe Clint Eastwood sex change Beatrix Kiddo takes up where she left off in her last hell bent crusade to exact revenge upon the indelicate crowd that made a mess of her wedding day. Facing some of the same cartoon characters from the first installment bridezilla runs into more than a share of rough patches (yes me lads an ladies Elle Driver is back) but it is more than clear from the twinkle in Kiddo's bulbous orb it's gonna take a lot more than a blast to the chest from a shot gun filled with rock salt and being buried alive to neutralize this righteous dudessa. Bill 2 is filled with Tarantino's typical smug sadism (it's all his characters seem to live for) and poor taste in music score lifting. There's the grindingly slow pace, the inept self indulgent use of film grammar (lotsa commas and capital letters) and as always the sentimental wallowing in vapid low budget nostalgia. It's the type of garbage that was third on the bill at the drive in back in the 70s when you were trying to get as much face time in with your date before you had to take her home ( 'Of course it's late, it was a triple feature.'). The only difference is that hipster auteur Tarantino has enough cash to spray paint it with a high gloss metallic lacquer that in this day and age gets gobbled up by a moronic generation raised on computer game violence with a reference point that stretches back as far as 1990. Can't wait for the third installment.",2,3,7,26 January 2011
Black Swan," Portman prevents Swan from diving
","Darren Aronofsky's signature hallucinogenic style dealing with the individual in crisis is well in evidence in this take on a prima ballerina going bonkers in pursuit of perfection. But there's more frosting than substance and Black Swan lurches from Polanski to Halloween franchise in order to make its case.Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is the hardest working hoofer in the ballet company over at Lincoln Center. A technical marvel she lacks the killer instinct to play the heavy but is never the less chosen to take on the dual role of the white and black swan in the Tchaikovsky ballet. In rehearsal white is going well, black isn't. Her autocratic and always horny director tries to get her to 'loosen up' with him or a Frisco company import, Lily who also is understudying her. Feeling the pressure (including that of a suffocating mother) Nina begins to descend into a paranoid abyss as the big dance approaches.Aronofsky usually deals with a heavy hand, balancing it with bravura camera work that climbs inside his troubled leads (Ellen Burstyn in Invitation to a Dream, Mickey Rourke in the Wrestler), forcing the audience to see the world through their eyes with ample amounts of subjective angles. He gets the same results here with Ms. Portman whose serene physical beauty is undermined by her struggle with a polarizing combination of innocence and ambition. But visually Swan flounders as the director with an embarrassment of possibilities to go Gothic horror zaps the films rhythm with repetitive and unnecessary supporting character re- enforcement. Andrew Libatiques camera work is a bit sloppy and erratic as he chases Nina around the stage duplicating dance moves without really achieving full extension. His resting compositions are at times shapeless and unfocused and while it may be arguable to say it does so to reflect Nina's emotional state its rumpled look extends beyond her character. The Black Swan tips its hand early but overall it is a decent suspense/horror film about the destructive nature of striving for perfection; something that Portman's performance flirts with from start to finish.",6,7,14,11 January 2011
Skyfall," Brand Bond still slickly packaged
","Like Cocoa Cola the James Bond franchise has run smoothly for nearly have a century with the same formula. Brash and predictable it still provides some hair raising moments in the traditional format of the instantly recognizable figure in silhouette, 60s electric guitar riffs a wild opening scene followed by a pop ditty the same as when I caught the Saturday matinée of Goldfinger back in the 60s. In Skyfall we are given the same adrenalin filled flawless start enhanced by today's evolving technology but we are also saddled by it's understandable intent to appeal to a larger audience in which Bond is a tad more touchy feely with major female players defraying action and pace in favor of tedious heart to hearts.James Craig is probably the best Bond since Connery and Javier Bardem a worthy quirky villain but with the odd choice of the pretentious Sam Mendes directing and an Oscar winner (Judy Dench) playing M the film bogs down in tedious dialog and the film begins to drag. There's a wonderful nostalgic re-appearance by a classic Bond character (non-human) but an equally disappointing non-appearance in a role tailor made for Sean but played by Albert Finney instead.There are some riveting action scenes but some sloppy ones as well and while it delivers much of the time it hangs around too long for its own good. Face it the first three Bonds in the early 60s will always be the gold standard no matter how advanced the technology.",6,0,6,10 January 2013
The Hangover," No headache, just laughs in Hangover.
","The Hangover is a reckless comedy that follows the usual male bonding road trip formula but with an edge that makes it stand out from the rest of the pack of sophomoric comedies made in this vein.Stu, his two best friends and his rather odd brother in law head for Vegas to celebrate his bachelor party. On the rooftop of the Bellagio they drink a toast to the night ahead. Flash forward to the next morning where three of the four awake to a trashed suite with a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in a bedroom. Stu is nowhere to be found and everyone's memory (due to spiked drinks) of the night before is a blank slate. In order to find Stu and get him to the church on time they must piece together the night before.Hangover's ability to maintain a degree of suspense, albeit comic, throughout while remaining irreverently hilarious as it goes in an out of bounds of credulity and taste is what makes it a refreshing entertainment. So a wedding chapel owner gets shot in the shoulder with no repercussions or the hapless trio agree to be tasered by police in a classroom who then give students a turn. Ridiculous? Yes? Hysterical? That too. It's clearly a guy film with it's un PC chauvinism, insensitivity and actions by the eclectic band of jerks in full display of extended adolescence but women's laughter was every bit as evident as men the day I caught the show. It was easy to see why.",7,2,4,12 June 2009
Marie Antoinette," Let them watch frosting: Sophia Coppola's flashy tea party.
","This embalmed piece of empty storytelling makes for one beautiful corpse with its Versailles locale, opulent set design and costuming and in the incapable hands of Sofia Coppola rigor mortis sets in fast.This latest re-telling of the fall of French Monarchy and the woman who helped bring it down is filled with sumptuous scenes of glorious costumes, colorfully lush decor and gluttonous excess by France's 18th century beautiful people. Coppola remains at a loss however to bring any substance to character or story. What she does she advances clumsily and with nothing much to say the striking imagery simply evaporates into fashion show and a caravan of pastry carts.Kirsten Dunst as teeny bopper Marie conveys beauty and little else. Dunst is not much of an actress and she is just as clueless here as she was in Coppola's other travesty, The Virgin Suicides. Jason Schwartzman is nearly invisible as Louis XVI. He is a cloying amalgam of a 10 year old and Hoffman's Ben Braddock. As a lady in waiting Judy Davis takes her repressed acting style to a new level. Rip Torn as Louis V gives the only acting performance the film offers, while the rest of the cast is required to do little else but display expressions of disdain and condescension and eat with their mouths open.In addition to her directionless direction Coppola employs a music score featuring Bow Wow Wow (ranting I Want Candy) and other au courants to personalize her vision with some ironic hipness. It comes across forced and uneven.Marie Antoinette is like a display wedding cake in a bakery shop window. It has an impressive frosted surface of color and design but underneath it remains hollow.",3,2,2,3 June 2008
It," Too much bump in the night waters It down.
","It has plenty of chills and thrills, along with too many characters and dead moments that weigh heavily on the pace of this dragged out horror that runs well over two hours. With Pennywise on the scene the film roars with sadistic terror but with a crowded field of unpleasant adults and vicious teens to hassle our small platoon of heroes the film slowly implodes into tedious Stand by Me bonding.In the Maine town of Derry kids are disappearing at an alarming rate and the parents don't seem to be concerned as much as a half a dozen loser kids confronting a real demon or their own personal fears. A bookish new kid discovers that every 27 years something dreadful befalls Derry convincing them to investigate further but that entails circumventing parental disdain and indifference to the situation along with the sadistic ever present teen thugs.Horror films like It demand a lot of suspension of disbelief that should be dished out at a healthy pace. Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) is an outstanding iconic villain that brings a real fun house feel to the theatre with a patient impish leer and sudden violent acts. Whether present or hinting of it Penny knows how to lay on the big scare. Unfortunately director Andy Mushietti slackens the pace by wasting time on the mawkish sensitive interplay of the children, each a heavy handed clichÃ© in a group that could have been halved to save time and amp up pace. But I guess Stephen King's book which I have not read placed heavy emphasis on growing pains which is misguidedly overplayed in a movie being sold as a terrifying roller coaster ride stalling on the interludes with a few too many creepy adults, bully scenes and obnoxious whiny kids when they should be allowing Pennywise to do his dirty work in under a hundred minutes. I only hope the heavily hinted at sequel will tighten things up with less adolescent growing pains and more of Penny's unique terror.",5,3,8,16 September 2017
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Rabbit hops along at an hilarious pace.
","One of the most original and novel films of the eighties Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a laugh filled non-stop comedy for all ages as well as subversive satire with historical roots. It is also history making with the first and only appearance on stage together of the two biggest quacks in animation history Donald and Daffy.Private Detective Eddie Valiant is hired to get the goods on cartoon star Roger Rabbit's voluptuous wife Jessica and Acme cartoon producer Marvin Acme. Producing evidence RR goes ballistic and Acme ends up dead. Naturally Rog is the prime suspect but Valiant digs deeper and finds there is a lot more to the equation than a simple homicide.Melding animation with reality fluidly Rabbit takes off from the get go with high comic moments from end to end as both Looney, Disney and assorted other cartoon greats make appearances that will permanently imprint a smile on your face from beginning to end. In addition there are some wonderfully appropriate references to Chinatown mimicking not only scenes but also bureaucratic skulduggery with a basis in truth that plagued LA in the first half of the century.Bob Hoskins as the rumpled alcoholic gumshoe is fire plug sized perfect to ride around in talking taxi's and punch out cartoon characters with a frustrated cynicism. Christopher Lloyd also fills the villain role with aplomb, sadistically dispensing with a toon in the films most disturbing scene. On the animation side Roger is annoyingly and hilariously unable to put a cork in it. The buxom Jessica is a combination Lauren Bacall, Mae West who claims she's not bad, 'just drawn that way'. Then there are the dozens of cameo performances of animated greats populating the film that never allow you to catch your breath along with all sorts of cartoon gadgets that make you realize the kid in you never left. Who Framed Roger Rabbit deserves to be called a unique classic.",9,1,1,26 February 2013
In Bruges," A Blot on a beautiful town.
","Director/writer Martin McDonagh's stunningly incredulous piece of sentimental claptrap involving touchy feely hit men and highly principled mob kingpins is all location, location. I've never visited a lovelier large town and this tale about a lethal Laurel and Hardy team is an insult to it's name.Ken and Ray have just performed a sloppy hit in which a priest and a young child are the victims. They're ordered to hideout in Bruges until they get further word from their boss Harry Waters. When orders do arrive they are for Ken to kill Ray. Veteran hit man Ken however goes soft for cuddly developmentally delayed Ray and can't go through with it. This is where things become absurdly unrealistic.McDonagh is well schooled in Coen and Tarantino but there are only hints of the former and an excess of the latter. There's some nice comic dialogue in the early going that balances well with the violent moments but after forty-five minutes things become convoluted and insipid as kingpin Waters takes it upon himself to go to Bruges alone assaulting citizens and running through town shooting away at Ray since from the looks of things the entire Bruges police force is on Christmas Holidays and it's left up to a pregnant hotel keeper to stand between gun toting thugs. Even though Ray and Ken go soft they are physically resilient to the point of super hero status. Ken already shot and bleeding profusely falls from a roughly three hundred foot church tower splatters on the cobblestones but still manages to warn Ray whose tough hide takes four shots to the trunk of his body but is gamely hanging on at the end. A supporting cast of ugly North Americans, a dwarf, a wimpy skin head, and a misunderstood drug dealing hooker, thief whose a sweet girl at heart are erratically developed and manage only to contribute to the films torpid pace.McDonagh spills blood liberally mixing it with heavy handed symbolism but it's pure comic book by the last half so it's hard to take the plot or the characters seriously. Colin Farrell's Ray has the makings of a fascinating and absorbing character in the films early moments but soon dilutes the suspense with a more impish than tortured approach that just repeats itself. As Ken, Brendan Gleeson displays a world weary fatigue with a convincing glum resignation that makes him the film's most interesting character before going soft and doing the inane swan dive from the church. Ralph Fiennes is completely over the top as the illogical mob boss.McDonagh does a fine job of filming Bruges, particularly at night but this is supposed to be more than a travelogue and his imagery and editing is unimaginative. In Bruges is one botched collage of poorly woven ideas, incoherently realized by a juvenile imagination. They should not have let McDonagh and company across the town line.",3,10,26,30 September 2008
Chinatown," As good as American film gets.
","A boatload of major Hollywood talent is on their game in this intricately complex tale of murder and corruption in 30s LA. Featuring a multi layered script of sub plot and deception by Robert Towne, impeccably translated by the florid cinema syntax of director Roman Polanski.JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a successful snoop dealing mainly in marital discord. When he's hired by a woman posing as the wife of the Water Commissioner, things immediately get ugly as prevarication runs rampant and people get hurt.Chinatown is a perfect blend of form and content. Every shot counts, every camera movement precise and for a reason. All characters resonate no matter how insignificant they may seem. For two hours he keeps both the audience and protagonist Gittes in the dark as he offers up one outstanding set piece after the next in a park, restaurant or a morgue brilliantly transitioning both place and mood as he does in one that starts out in a barbershop. Bloodletting is brief and minimal but about as brutal and jolting as any you will find in film. Leads and misleads are subtle as we literally in some cases tale Jake throughout the whole film since he is in every scene allowing us to watch things unravel in real time.The sardonic Nicholson is tailor made for the role, his smart ass remarks fitting like a glove as he takes his lumps and stumbles upon evidence inadvertently doing more harm than good. Faye Dunaway's fatale is magnificently ambiguous, her icy exterior deceptive enough to allow the mystery to deepen even further into the film's running time. John Huston is tour de force avuncular creepy and Polanski in a cameo an imposing diminutive gimp with a blade.John Alton's cinematography, Richard Sylbert's production design, Sam O'Steen's editing, Anthea Sylbert's costume design and especially Jerry Goldsmith's plaintive moody score all rise in compliment to Polanski's dark polished vision.Arguably the finest American film of the last half century no amount of superlatives can convey the challenge, demand and awe to be found in one's first viewing of this cinematic masterpiece. Subsequent viewings will be void of the mystery that is perfectly shadowed from end to end yet the edifying moments of repeated showings will make the experience no less satisfying. Chinatown easily ranks with The Maltese Falcon and The Big Sleep as the best detective film in history. It's eloquent masterful telling by Polanski as graceful and well spoken as cinema language gets. Chinatown is film done perfect.",10,3,5,11 January 2019
Wind River," Snow job.
","Jeremy Renner delivers a fine performance and the state of Wyoming looks magnificent in this hackneyed disappointment of a murder mystery that sulks from beginning to end. Sloppy and improbable it stumbles more than once as it injects statement, upending a rhythm that is near moribund to begin with a cast of characters snowbound in blues.Corey Lambert (Renner) is Wyoming game warden trying to balance the predator population in Wyoming when he comes across the body of 18 year Natalie Hanson, dead from hypothermia but while running from something in the process. With the death occurring on tribal land FBI agent Jane Banner (Liz Olsen) is assigned to sought things out but makes a less than impressive debut that she more than makes up for with some deadly shooting, take charge tough talk as well as withstand half a can of mace sprayed in her face without mussing hair or make-up. Eventually they get around to dropping by the prime suspects place. At this point the already sputtering story stalls momentarily to play with time and tenderness and in doing so obliterate the meager tension remaining before resuming the earlier aborted climax killing carnage that auteur Taylor Sheridan interrupts to jam a strong woman statement in. It rings hollow (much of the blame belonging to the limited and miscast Olsen) and drains the outcome of impact to go along with a busy Lambert in the film's final minutes sun setting with three different characters. As the credits role Sheridan makes another pitch for the plight of women on reservations but it does not assuage the fact Wind River is a clumsy, gratuitously violent piece of sadism made even more distasteful by a concern that is meant to purchase license for his slipshod mayhem and murky funk.",4,10,28,6 September 2017
The Big Lebowski," Living in the Past
","The Dude is content to let life go by if can bowl once a week, get stoned and sit in his bathtub surrounded by candles. This meditative deadbeat existence is suddenly thrown into disarray however when a couple of thug debt collectors break into his pad, shove his head in the toilet and urinate on his rug. It turns out he is a victim of mistaken identity. At the urging of his semi-psycho bowling partner Walter (he pulls out a 45 to settle an argument over two pins)Dude seeks recompense from the intended Lebowski, a well heeled millionaire with a mansion and a teenage wife who may have been kidnapped by German nihilists.Jeff Bridges is a perfect fit as The Dude inhabiting the mannerisms and style as well as displaying the contented munchies developed gut of a lifetime passive resister still living the summer of love. In perfect counterbalance is fellow kegler and ex Viet vet Walter who is also living in the past but at Tet. By share force of personality John Goodman's Walter occupies center stage as much as Dude. Shadowing wispily in the background the timid Donny (Steve Buscemi)rounds out the unlikely trio. In a bowling tournament sub-plot opponent John Turturro as Jesus is over the top hilarious as he baits Walter and The Dude. Philip Seymour Hoffman as millionaire Lebowski's obsequious assistant also registers in a brief role.Like its protagonist The Big Lebowski is a lovable shaggy dog of a movie whose layed back style purposely and with hilarious results undermines the seriousness and suspense of the kidnapping and amputation that drive the plot. Not since the late Pro Bowler Ray Bluth's unique bowling style has the game been presented in such an unorthodox way. Taking the mundane washed out color setting of a bowling alley (including the parking lot) the brothers Coen create a surreal dream in which eras and genres collide as they borrow from and update classics with their own visual flare. From the bowlers montage over the credits to Busby Berkeley musical numbers, Jesus's entrance and the out of sync conversations between the team the Coens deftly utilize the alley setting, fully realizing it's ignored potential of pop art and surrealism.The convoluted plot might suggest some Big Sleep and the anachronistic Dude might have a resemblance to Gould's Long Goodbye Marlowe but the style and presentation are pure Coen in three hundred game form.",9,0,2,29 March 2008
Public Enemies," Public embarrassment.
","There is an efficient fluidity of failure in every facet of Public Enemies that astounds as it frantically uncoils with sloppy incomprehension and crass piousness over it's two and a half hours running time. The John Dillinger film bio which gets recycled every 30 years (45 with Lawrence Tierney, 74 with Warren Oates) this time around has a bigger budget, bigger stars and slicker production values making the finished product with its wretched excess even more appalling. Heavy handed, master of bombast Michael Mann's (Heat, Miami Vice) bloated and ponderous style jerks rather than plods this time with cinematographer Dante Spinotti's jittery camera-work shot mostly in tight under lit close-up obliterating composition and setting throughout. As Dillinger, Johnny Depp does a very impressive Elvis imitation; more lovestruck than ruthless, more thoughtful than reckless. It's an abomination. Depp may have more talent than the other Dillingers but Oates was edgier and Tierney probably would have been more at home as a member of the real gang than the Hollywood crowd he populated. Depp is too suave, noble and lovesick. Christian Bale is equally woeful as Melvin Purvis; emptily staring out from beneath a fedora most of the time, sounding like a subdued Tennessee Williams character when he does blurt something out. Marie Cotillard as main squeeze Billie looks glum throughout while Billy Crudup's mincing J. Edgar Hoover (closely and silently shadowed by agent/lover Charles Tolson) and Stephen Graham's manic Baby Face Nelson provide unintended comic relief.Of course blow hard Mann's big and empty acts of self indulgence would not be complete without the self important cathedral music scores of Elliot Goldenthal. As he did most memorably in another hot air balloon Heat, Mann attempts to elevate his hardscrabble characters and situations to mythic proportions with grand flourishes of Goldenthal's vapid score. It fits like a cheap suit. This isn't knights of the round table, it's the Depression.Amid all this ineptitude Mann manages to find time to be au courant (shades of Guantanamo) by shoehorning a police interrogation scene involving torture and it's ineffectiveness into the story. Typical of his clumsy and fatuous style he even takes it up a notch by having the craven inquisitor look like, you guessed it Dick Cheney. It makes one wonder if Mann needs a crane to lift his hands. Public Enemies is a textbook example of arrogantly bad film-making. With it's slick and expensive look, star power and self importance it displays a blundering confidence, gutting history and making the fatal mistake to go Bonnie and Clyde (not to mention the beautifully realized doomed lover bank robber films They Drive by Night, Thieves Like Us and Gun Crazy) while ignoring the grittier more realistic possibilities on the life and death of the Twentieth Century's most infamous bank robber. It's a fatal mistake that makes Public Enemies DOA.",3,18,46,1 July 2009
Knives Out," Knives Out doesn't cut it.
","When 85 year old mystery writer multi millionaire Harlan Thrombley (Christopher Plummer) is found with his throat slit, foul play is naturally suspected. Previous to his demise he decides to cut his parasite family out of the will and give it to his nurse Marta, (Ana De Armas) much to the angry chagrin of the rest of the family. Meanwhile famed detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is brought on the case by a mysterious employer to untangle things.Clue anyone? Performances by all the suspects are arch and played for laughs but not many materialize. They are simply en masse a greedy, unctuous family offering broad performances and cringing personalities while Craigs corn porn accent grills suspects with marbles in his mouth.Rian Johnson's direction is anemic as he relies on guilty expressions in wide angle to advance his predictable plot that attempts to have two mysteries (one to clear our heroine, one to find the real culprit ) hanging in the balance and both are torpidly pursued.The real star is ultimately the mansion and its incredible interior of furniture, secret passages and fantastic wall paper that gives the film a Gothic mystery feel. It at least gives you something to look at while Craig mumbles and surly family members crumble.",5,31,60,3 December 2019
The Irishman," Enough Scorsese leftovers to give you agita
","Stylish, empty and overlong Martin Scorsese's Irishman is one long conversation featuring an exhausted looking Robert DiNero, a frail Joe Pesce and an over the top Al Pacino in a bad toupee. It's like watching the Marx Bros. in Go West, rusty ghosts of the past.The Irishman follows the career of close Jimmy Hoffa confidant and mobbed up hitman Frank Sheehan. Tied in with some of the greatest hits Scorsese provides a score card of casualties to buttress his film with historical fact and with snippets borrowed from the usual suspects, MeanStreets, Taxi Driver, Good Fellas, Casino. It is a veritable senior citizen version of Good Fellas.DiNero has not been able to carry a two hour film in twenty years and here we are asked to endure over three with a doughy and somewhat distorted Bobby looking old from the outset, his movements creaky, his delivery half hearted. A scene where he beats a grocer takes on an almost laughable WWE look as he huffs and puffs through some rage of yesteryear. Pacino starts well but wears thin. You just look at Joe Pesce and worry about his health. The wives wear loud clothes are vapid and loyal. The only energized and enthusiastic performance is delivered by Bo Dietl as union flunky Joe Glimco.Scorsese does apply lipstick on this hippo with a certain flair as his camera sweeps in on crane shots and he tracks more than Max Ophuls employing an excess of wide angle framing in order to showcase his nostalgic recreation while employing his signature aid of pop music and Fellini like mugs. It all leads however to DiNero's dense monotone narration and one close up after the next of tired old men in tough guy conversation a decade or two past their prime as actors. The Irishman is one stale bore.",5,30,60,27 November 2019
The Great Dictator," The Great Chaplin
","With war raging in Europe and only a matter of time before America's entrance Charlie Chaplin took it upon himself to go where other moguls feared to tread with this courageous satirical broadside. The Great Dictator does not mince words with its comic evisceration of Adolf Hitler and his Fascist cronies. It is a savage mock-up in which only Chaplin alone could make a comic moment out of the fascist lynching of a Jew without devaluing the impact of the film's firm indictment and condemnation.The film opens on a World War l battlefield with Charlie evoking his 1918 Shoulder Arms silent character manning Big Bertha. He suffers battle fatigue and is sent to a sanitarium to recuperate. Meanwhile Dictator Adenoid Hynkel capitalizes on his country's economic woes by scapegoating the Jews (and after them the brunettes). The vet unable to comprehend the passing of time returns to civilian life and his job as a Jewish Barber, unaware of his country's moral deconstruction. Hynkel continues to lust for world power while the Barber is brought up to speed by cruel storm troopers when fate intervenes.This timely and absurdist black comedy on the eve of WW ll might be the finest piece of Hollywood political activism in Tinsel Town history. Chaplin could have easily stayed out of the argument but chose instead to wade in not with some prepared statement or sit down protest but with the full weight of his prodigious talent resulting in a motion picture that sits between Duck Soup and Dr. Strangelove in displaying the brilliance of satiric Voltarian discourse by way of Mack Sennett.Chaplin's script and Hynkel's portrayal along with fellow cronies is devastatingly funny and demeaning reducing them to comic buffoons; removing their Conrad Veidt to vanquish them from another angle. Hynkel is a vainglorious Moe and Chaplin cuts him to the quick with a comic jabber and an unsettling but balletic display of lust for power. Henry Daniel as Garbige is chillingly serious and persuasive in mock contrast to funny but a bit over the top Billy Gilbert's Herring and Jack Oakie's Napaloni, though Mussolini newsreels from the era reveal not by much.Chaplin does get overly preachy during the climax and it deflects from the no holds barred style of the humor and pace somewhat but overall it is a brave and audacious piece of film making in which someone can so powerfully assimilate pain and laughter without diluting the impact of either.",9,0,1,10 December 2010
Dead Poets Society," Goodbye Mr. Quips
","This cloyingly overlong prep school based drama about a teacher thinking outside the box in 50s America and a mix of conflicted dullards he influenced to literally new heights with tragic consequence seems to meander more than build. When it finally does at nearly two hours grasp some intensity it does so by a quick fix deus ex machina.Newly arrived John Keating ( Robin Williams) roars into his first year at the staid Welton Academy with some unorthodox ideas. A former student himself he encourages the lads to reform the Dead Poet's Society and seize the day. It all seems rather odd that having gone to the school and understood its highly conservative motto he might take it kind of slow in his first year but hey, no one's gonna get in the way of Robin doing his routine.Williams is mawkishly idealistic, less zany more zen. Only he could commit an act of Fascist book burning and make it seem nobly liberating. His students are more or less relegated to looking upon him in awe addressing him in hushed tones. Norman Lloyd as the headmaster chews up more than one desk.Peter Weir's direction lingers rather than soar and the film never achieves much trajectory, just plods in mostly morose adolescent funk. John Searles cinematography is town and country and Maurice Jarrre's music score flush with pompous importance. Dead Poet's Society may not be dead on arrival but it's in critical condition most of the way.",6,1,1,14 October 2011
Midnight in Paris," Getting lost with the Lost Generation
","Midnight in Paris is one of Woody Allen's better efforts over the past decade which for the most part has been repetitive and erratic. There are some bumpy moments and Allen sometimes allow his conceit to become a little too precious and stretched but Owen Wilson as his scruffy alter ego does a commendable job of playing guide to the ride to the past and Allen does a good job of disguising the outcome late into the film.Gil (Owen Wilson) is a Malibu screenwriter visiting Paris on a freebie with his fiancé's parents. Totally caught up in the past he pines for the romance of The Lost Generation and a desire to stay in the City of Lights and get caught in rain storms but squeeze Inez wants him back in sunny California churning out garbage for studios. One night, a bit tipsy, he takes a walk and gets lost. Attempting to get his bearings the clock strikes twelve and a vintage automobile pulls up with partying occupants who lure him in and back to Twenties Paris where he is introduced to the cream of the art world. He converses with the Fitgeralds, Hemingway, Picasso, Gertrude Stein among others as well as becoming infatuated with Pablo's mistress. Back in the Twenty-First Century things are becoming more abrasive with Inez and family. Gil now ponders whether he should return and remain in the previous century.Things move slowly in Midnight as Allen declares his total love for the City of Lights with a ponderous travelogue opening before going voice over into the credits to establish almost immediately the strain between Gil and Inez. Tagging along with another couple Inez keeps up her demeaning ways ad nausea until we are rescued by time travel with Gil and the Montparnesse crowd but the novelty begins to thin, that is until Gil hangs out with the Surrealists (Luis Bunuel, Man Ray and a terrific cameo turn by Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali) and the pace and humor begin to finally pick-up as Gil attempts to straighten his backbone. Allen name drops to no end with his legendary characters. Making some esoteric comic inferences such as explaining the plot of The Exterminating Angel to a confused Bunuel that may not resonate with the audience at large but one doesn't need to be up on his 20th century art and literature to find a decent amount of humor in Midnight.Owen Wilson is one of the best protagonist fits for Allen in some time but problems persist for his female characters with all three romantic interests ( Rachel McAdams, Marian Cotillard Nina Arianda) somewhat cliché and underdeveloped. Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy as the parents do a fine job of allowing Allen to get in his jabs about conservative, ugly Americans while Corey Stoll as Papa Hemingway does a wonderfully stoic take on his macho ethos. Carla Bruni, wife of French President Sarkozy appears as a translator which is probably not a bad method of getting a country's cooperation to allow you to shoot a Keatonesque slap stick scene in Versailles Hall of Mirrors. Allen has done time and space travel before. He's done it better ( Zelig, The Purple Rose of Cairo) funnier (Sleeper) and worse (Scoop) but in today's era of devalued cinema Midnight in Paris offers decent respite from the frat house moronic humor and computer generated cuddly creatures monopolizing screens at the multiplex and perhaps reinforcing our understanding of why Gil wants out of these times.",7,1,3,4 July 2011
Zodiac," Well crafted Zodiac a suspenseful search.
","Films based in fact often play fast and loose with the truth. Witness the semi slanderous history lessons of Oliver Stone. The story of the Zodiac, a serial killer who terrorized San Francisco and other California counties in the 60s and 70s has sensationalism written all over it since he was never officially caught. A filmmaker undertaking the project would have a myriad of options to fictionalize the fact that the Zodiac existed. Judging from his previous blood and guts works (7even, Fight Club) I expected another lengthy gore fest from director David Fincher. I was thankfully mistaken. While there are some brutal and violent moments, Zodiac spends most of it's time battering its characters psychologically in their frustrating decades long search for the killer. It's a gripping portrait from end to end.Over two and a half hours in length Zodiac steadily maintains suspense throughout as the investigation veers in all directions with false leads,wrong suspects and police departments failing to coordinate. Fincher uses his three major characters almost as a relay team to run the course of the film. Editorial cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gylenhal)police inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and reporter Paul Avery(Robert Downey Jr.) doggedly pursue leads but over the years fatigue and burn out set in. Erratic behavior leads to discord and suspicion as we watch each character stumble.Fincher ably captures the times and the city of San Francisco living in a state of fear which includes a clip from a film made during that time about the Zodiac called Dirty Harry. He eschews the pro-vigilante theatrics of this classic in favor of presenting the truth and adding depth without diluting the suspense making Zodiac a draining but engrossing experience.",8,0,0,2 August 2008
Milk," Lukewarm
","The life of Harvey Milk, which through his own admission was nothing special at forty certainly contains all the elements for absorbing cinema. A charismatic late blooming civil rights activist, he mobilized a marginalized segment of society into a political power with a relentless determination that went from a series of political defeats to victory and eventually martyrdom. Milk's mercurial rise and fall is an absorbing story but perhaps too brief to justify it's over two hour running time.Director Gus Van Zandt opens Milk by economically summing up his adult years and what he faced as a gay man in New York with documentary photos and footage of the famed Stonewall incident in the early 60's. With this as a backdrop we are introduced to the priapic Milk (Sean Penn) cruising a guy on a subway platform. Becoming lovers they decide to escape the oppressive east coast scene and go Greeley. Moving to San Francisco they open a camera store. Milk once again experiences bigotry but this time he decides like those at the Stonewall to take a stand. Successfully employing the same boycott tactics that Civil Rights groups did in the segregationist South in the fifties he finds his voice and becomes a leading activist in SFs gay community. Running for office he is defeated twice but perseveres and is eventually elected a city manager where he locks horns with conservative ex-cop Dan White, his and the city mayor's ultimate assassin. Milk's greatest battle though is with American as apple pie orange juice pitch person and homophobe poster child Anita Bryant who is zealously attempting to blacklist gay school teachers throughout the country.Through Milk's character Van Zandt carefully and clearly conveys the struggle for equality an end to the blatant discrimination homosexuals faced in the seventies. It is an historically significant story but Milk's private life is mostly soap opera and it breaks the torrid pace of the events taking place on the world stage. Van Zandt tries to elevate it with operatic crutches (literally employing Tosca) but it becomes mired in self indulgence and repetitious scenes of Harvey half lit speaking into a tape recorder and this deadens the rhythm of the film. Sean Penn is incredibly moving as Milk. Avoiding the over the top scenery chewing he served up in the recent All the King's Men remake, he gives us a man of commitment whose greatest strength was not to take himself so seriously. Penn deftly sidesteps queening it up (going Capote) with wonderfully controlled nuance and inflection bringing a great degree of dignity to the character. Beyond Penn's performance, the rest of the cast offers little more than reactions and Van Zandt fails to explore in much depth the crucial character of Dan White, up tightly overplayed by Josh Brolin. The film's only other intriguing character is to be found in the documentary footage of Miss Anita Bryant spewing her blind hatred in a most ladylike fashion and it is a chilling performance to witness.",7,1,4,17 February 2009
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," The unglamorous world of espionage.
","Director Tomas Alfredson and company do their best to deglamorize the surly double dealing world of counter intelligence in John Le Carre's Tinker, Tailor soldier spy. Drained of color and muted in every way ( tan and gray seems to be the fashion choice for everyone ) it is a long way from the jet setting action packed world of James Bond.After a mission goes very bad in Budapest the head of a British Intelligence branch, Control ( John Hurt) is forced out along with agent George Smiley (Gary Oldman) of the bureau. When it's discovered that a mole is operating within the agency Smiley is brought back in an attempt to expose him.Without the fast cars, gadgets, babes and things to blow up TTSS is a pretty somber and low key affair that has an intriguing enough start. The agents are mostly surly, cynical and distrustful and suspects are numerous. The narrative itself is a series of confusing flashbacks and dark shadows however and the film soon begins to drown in convolution bogging down in excessive wordplay and the occasional shock incidental.Oldman as Smiley looks and moves with a convincing world weary persona of a man who takes his work seriously, maybe too much. Director Alfredson's intent to keep things low key drains the life out of most of his characters, especially Smiley and by extension the picture itself. His direction overall is erratic at best as his juggling act of adding peripheral characters and placing more importance than needed on superfluous scenes only serves to make matters more distracting and confusing. Sober as it is most of the way Alfredson tacks on a mawkish denouement with a touch of happily ever after summed up in natty threads and an expression of smug satisfaction which deviates in a jarring way the film's mood and tone over the previous two hours.",6,1,3,13 January 2012
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Wild Bunch light.
","Released on the hooves of Sam Peckinpah's blood drenched last gasper The Wild Bunch Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a kinder gentler more sanitized for public consumption look at outlaws on the run with the Twentieth Century gaining on them fast. It even has a pop tune video and a jolly Burt Bacharach score to keep things light and mawkish which might spell disaster for a wild west shoot'em up were it not for the legendary first and best pairing of Newman and Redford as Butch and Sundance.The Hole in the Wall Gang has been making a living robbing trains for awhile when the Pinkerton's begin to intensify their pursuit. With their membership decimated Butch, Sundance and his girlfriend light out east to NY and eventually on to Bolivia in hopes of beginning anew.The naturalness between the laid back Butch and the wound tight Sundance has the perfect cadence of a friendship partnership developed over time as they play off of each other with the comfortable familiarity of a Tracy Hepburn duo.For a film featuring protagonists with a bounty on their head Cassidy has an upbeat mood most of the way as director Arthur Hiller keeps things light and polished but nearly sacrifices the picture in favor of entertainment with the intrusive BJ Thomas ditty video and an overlong montage of tintype imagery from Coney Island. It is left up to Conrad Hall's cinematography, especially in low light situations, to supply the film's power and suspense with one outstanding composition after another. With Hall's strong look informing the picture and Newman/Redford clicking like Rogers and Astaire Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is well worth a watch in spite of it's heavy saccharine aftertaste.",7,0,0,18 January 2014
Crash," Crash is a Wreck
","In Crash, Director Paul Haggis goes Altmanesque with this garbled attempt to discuss bigotry in contemporary LA. Overall it lacks Altman's energy and offers up gross cliché characters instead of quirky originals. Crash begins to go into its spin right after Detective Weathers (Don Cheadle) sums up the 'City of Angels' populace in the first line of the film. 'In LA nobody touches you. We're all behind glass and metal. Sometimes I think we crash into each other just so we can feel something.' We are then introduced to a full cast of impatient, ill tempered Angelinos of all stripe and persuasion connected in some way to make life miserable for each other. There's the bigoted cop, the successful 'Uncle Tom' black, the Asian trafficking in human cargo, the hard working Latino, the misunderstood Persian and gang banger of principle. It's LA as a microcosm of the world, Hollywood style.The enemy is ourselves seems to be the message as Crash's one dimensional characters snarl at each other from start to finish with occasional moments of insight and exposed vulnerability as they spend scene after scene reciting well worn bigoted archaisms that have been around for decades. When Haggis runs out of these he goes into music video mode with a solemn track playing over a montage of Crash's hapless citizens looking dutifully glum.Serious as it attempts to be Crash is a rather vapid message picture with a couple of incendiary scenes connected by preposterous coincidence that patronizes its token cast when its not busy spitting stilted racist venom. It's a five car pile-up.",4,17,25,25 November 2007
BlacKkKlansman," Lee's Black privilege fails to disguise heavy hand.
","Spike Lee gets his shots in at the Klan in this lumbering repetitive tale of a black detective infiltrating the organization in BlacKkKlansman. One shot however is in his foot as he exposes himself for what he condemns.
Dan Stallworth is hired by the mostly lily white Colorado Springs Police Department where he chafes at the smug bias of officers in the records room. He requests a switch to detectives where he is given assignments to infiltrate the Black Panthers and KKK which finds him a love interest and getting up close with grand wizard David Duke, acting as his bodyguard during a visit. Eventually the dim witted Klan members put things together and plan a big hurt for Stallworth and his politically woke squeeze.
Poorly paced, haphazardly edited, Lee loosely attaches the plots of his storyline together without much rhythm or energy, his players (with the exception of some of his moronic goobers) lifeless dullards of sober demeanor that make every pregnant pause overdue. The entire cast looks like it could use some rest.
There are attempts by Lee to be au courant hip (it's Saturday Night's Live's Alec Baldwin! And how bout that title? ) and address today's racial tension with current news footage perhaps attempt to elevate this banal film's gravitas. But it cannot hide Lee's lifelong problem with pacing, packed on mostly with insipid dialogue and sermonizing displayed in abundance here with Lee's heavy handed juxtaposition.Most revealing is Spike's handling of scenes from Birth of a Nation with its vile representation of virulent racist black faced northern pillagers. Given the absolute clueless imbeciles of the Klan and the casual bigotry of the boys in blue he presents in his film one might suggest Mr. Griffith has taught him well. A shame DW's artistic style never rubbed off on him. BlackkKlansman is a rambling bore.",3,8,19,5 December 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Cinema worthy of Swift
","There has never been a more biting and prescient satire on mainstream American film than Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, a black comedy about nuclear annihilation. In the face of this sober reality Kubrick and co-writer Terry Sothern's scenario provides an endless parade of petty buffoons in power played out by a veteran cast of actors who give career performances.Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) has gone rogue on his commanders and put into place a plan to attack the U.S.S.R. with nuclear bombs. When Mandrake (Peter Sellers) a timid British officer gets hint of the problem he brings it to Ripper's attention who locks down the area and shuts down communication with the outside world in order to assure fruition to his plan. In an underground bunker President Muffley (Sellers) debates with the Russian Ambassador on how to avoid mutually assured destruction. As ideas are tossed around Dr. Strangelove (you guessed it) offers the most radical. Meanwhile back at the base Ripper lectures Mandrake on the theft of precious bodily fluids.Strangelove clicks on all cylinders in perfect harmony. The story is audacious in its presentation given perfect breadth by the darkly comic life like caricature richness of type with the cold dark oppressive neon light sets and compositions of Kubrick's claustrophobic and sterile world providing ironic staging to the serious and hilarious goings on.Peter Sellers deserves the triple crown for his trio but George C. Scott, Peter Bull, Slim Pickens, Keenan Wynn and especially Sterling Hayden in the time they are allotted hold their own with him though it must be said Kubrick's wide angle and framing does decidedly add to each performance. Acclaimed overwhelmingly as a classic upon its initial release nearly fifty years ago Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove has lost none of its luster over that period and I'd like to believe it says more about the flawless assembly of the film than civilization. But given these times with nukes in the hands of world leaders that literally match the caricatures created by Kubrick and Southern it is clear little has been learned in that time. It does show however that Kubrick was well ahead of us in realizing it.",10,2,4,17 April 2010
Horrible Bosses," Horrible leads can's Bosses.
","The bosses are excellent but the trio of leads dreadful in this pedal to the metal comedy that floors it from the start but doesn't get far with these three flat tires. Lotsa screeching but little traction.Nick, Dale and Kurt bemoan the fact that they love their jobs but hate their bosses. Unable to quit and move on they decide to hire a hit man to off them but that goes un hysterically wrong and they are left to do the dirty work by themselves. They then spend the remaining hour plus trying to whack them in a series of poorly timed dark humored bits that fall for the most part flat on their face under the slipshod direction of Seth Gordon.As the villains of the piece Kevin Spacey, Jenniffer Aniston and especially Colin Farrell as a coke head CEO with a green belt fulfill their part of the bargain with flying colors. Jamie Farr faux hit-man also registers but Jason Bateman's Nick is without spark, Jason Sudeikis' Kurt's smarmy confidence off putting and Charlie Day's Dale aggressively abrasive Bobcat Goldwaithe resurrection one annoying harangue from start to finish. There is no chemistry at all between these three stooges and the adolescent logic they employ as each clearly ignore what the other one says. I realize fifty five is the new forty but these guys act like thirty five is the new fifteen.The extent of Gordon's erratic and anally fixated direction looks like he outlined a scene turned his camera on and let the three say whatever came into their droll minds; the result being blank stares, unctuous cool and whiny hissy fits. In the credits Gordon parades his ineptitude even further by showing outtakes, one of which features the zany Farrell in a drug store dealing with a pharmacist. In its truncated version it is far funnier than most of the dead wood floating through the body of this picture magnifying to an even greater degree the horrible decisions by the makers of this slop.",4,28,58,29 July 2011
The Town," Actors and film could use a shave in this cops and robbers fairy tale.
","Director Ben Affleck displays a much better grasp of storytelling and film grammar in his second time (the belabored Gone Baby Gone) out as director but his overbearing le petit Marlon Brando lead eats up too much celluloid and The Town loses its grip not far from the finish line before convulsing in mawkish sentimentality as it takes incredulity and perverse optimism into another stratosphere. Doug MacRae and his gang are an efficient quartet of armored car and bank robbers operating out of Charlestown MA. He foolishly becomes involved with a bank employee in one of his robberies and this sets off all sorts of alarms for the gang and the FBI. Mercifully in between we are treated to some hair raising chases and shootouts climaxing at Fenway Park.Afflecks cloying Doug is all moody torpor and the sadness of his childhood and newly uncovered information about it are met with dumbfounded and inexpressive stares. It's embarrassing Brando in need of a shave. Also in need of some facial landscaping is FBI pursuer Adam Frawley played by Jon Hamm with a refreshing touch of sadism. As Mac Crae's trigger happy sidekick Coughlin, Jeremy Renner is Cagney 2000 and the worse for it. Peter Postlewaite as a Whitey Bulger like florist walks away with acting honors. Better to watch two hours of an ugly grand actor emote than the flat handsomely chiseled features of the melancholy Townie Affleck who has as much range as Ahab at short. Director Affleck does have a good eye for capturing the congested New England Town of Charlestown as well as Boston and his chase scenes really screech with suspense but the weight he accords the unreality of the films romantic aspects puts the breaks on The Town allowing it to advance no further as this self indulgent noir has a head on collision with a fairy tale ending that fades to a folk song over credits. This is the second example of more is worse in The Friends of Eddie Coyle wanna be stakes. First there was the bloated The Departed with a roster of Easter hams and regurgitations of Scorcese violence and now this slick looking slam bang / implausible romancer. The minor masterpiece Coyle choked with realism and an unromantic mood of taedium vitae that today's cool and Affleck's incurable romanticism just won't allow. It may look and taste good but that's because its filled with sugar.",5,4,9,5 October 2010
Closer," Corny Knowledge
","Some things never change. Nearly forty years after Mike Nichols explored a quartet of adult relationships in the over-hyped, drab and limp Carnel Knowledge comes Closer an over-hyped drab and limp exploration of love and betrayal dealing with another foursome of vapid, transparent characters. Little has changed over the period with the males still insecure sex obsessed boys and the women restrained adults swimming in melancholy, victimized by the eternal child.Newspaper obit writer Dan (Jude Law) rushes to the aid of waitress / stripper Alice (Natalie Portman) who is bumped over by a taxi. The two become romantic and move in together. With her as muse he writes a promising book but falls for Anna (Julia Roberts) the photographer doing his jacket cover portrait. During a chat room exchange Dan let's his negative capability get the best of him, posing as female for horny surgeon Larry ( Clive Owen) that leads Lar to Anna. Anna marries Larry but Dan leaves Alice for Anna who leaves Larry for Dan causing Larry to stop shaving and straightening his tie and pay a visit to Alice at the strip club where his bestial desires heightened by sequins and colorful neon demand great restraint. Sensitive Dan in the meantime, with his 'addiction to the truth' grows petulant and weepy after a couple of epiphanies while looking into mirrors. Nichols characters are like the letters on a compass; demarcated by type. Sensitive male, brute male, young beautiful free spirit female, mature beautiful cautious female. They also interact in the same way since they don't seem to be listening to one another. The cast never seems to jell as Nichols disjointed narrative leaps to and fro without establishing relationships or maintaining mood from one scene to the next. Chemistry between the actors is non- existent as they try to stay within their insecure types. Jude Law's Dan is a spoiled unlikable child while Owen is a caveman infant terrible. Julia Roberts shows little enthusiasm for either male but has a whirlwind marriage with one while falling passionately in love with the other all in a year's time. Leave it to the world wise precocious stripper, effectively done by Portman to be the most level headed as she deals out sage advice while lying spread eagle before lustful Larry at the club.Closer is a sober, solemn bore that whimpers along from start to finish. It's attempt to rise above its torpor with updated dirty talk and considerable exposure of Ms. Portman's (it's partially successful here) hot bod results in tepid titillation all around with this Carnal Redux by Nichols breaking no new ground two generations later. Relying on wide eyed pursed lipped close-ups of good looking movie stars to get at the heart of the matter never even scratches the surface of what makes their characters tick.

Lost in Translation," Adults behaving cautiously.
","Fading movie star Bob Harris ( Bill Murray ) arrives in Japan for a big pay day doing a whiskey commercial. There he meets Charlotte, the bored wife of a photographer on assignment ( Scarlett Johanssen ) and the two spend of the rest of the picture alternating goofing on the Japanese and treading lightly around intimate feeling. Writer, director Sophia Coppola infuses Translation's melancholy bent with some striking imagery, energized editing and carefree nature as the two leads contend with Tokyo neon and culture in basically an action-less film where confusion and monotony is the catalyst. The late night bar scenes at the hotel create an ideal atmosphere for quiet desperation and tempered by Murray's craggy face dead panning evokes Antonionni with a sense of humor. The simmering sexual tension between the two begins to wear thin after awhile though and Coppola's compromising positions and pregnant pauses begin to repeat and fail to move the story forward. The open ended climax informed by an inflated music score and a step up in the emotion department simply fails to register or live up to the film's first hour and Lost just wanders to its mottled conclusion.",6,1,2,11 January 2012
Barry Lyndon," Kubrick's beautiful museum tour bore.
","Stanley Kubrick offers up end to end JMW Turner landscapes along with some eye popping portraiture of 18th century styled Marisa Berenson in this stunningly photographed visual masterpiece lensed by John Alcott. But given its lengthy running time featuring a dreadfully miscast Ryan O'Neal as the title character it amounts to little more than a museum tour; and even The Louvre gets tiresome after three hours.
Youthful Redmond Brady falls for his cousin Nora, getting himself into a duel with an English Army Captain and killing him causing him to flee Ireland, be waylaid by highwaymen, join the army, desert, sleep with the farmer's wife, join the Prussian Army, hook up with an Irish card sharp and marry into title and property the massive success he had hoped to become before a swift downturn in fortune.In the hands of a capable actor of the day, Barry Lyndon may well have ranked as one of Kubrick's better films but O'Neal simply rings hollow from end to end going from an overgrown chubby cheeked young adult to a dissipated, aging old man with the healthy glow of Malibu Ryan still in evidence. His lilt is a timid wisp and Kubrick's incessant close-ups of his lifeless look of hurt an indignation after awhile can no longer be assuaged by Stanley taking us on frequent trips to the country.Michael Hordern lends the imagery and the dignity it demands with his narration while chamber orchestras bang out Vivaldi, Bach and Schubert among others to present us with one gracious tableau after the next but with O'Neal as the linchpin to this picaresque journey across the magnificent countryside of Ireland and GB the picture staggers more than gallops.Kubrick himself bears blame with a running time that includes four duels, the first offering one of the film's more expedient moments while two others run inexorably overlong. His mesmerizing candle lit interior shots at times seem like they will run the length the stick or at least until the band takes a break.Barry Lyndon may be the prettiest girl at the dance by far but it lacks the energy of Tom Jones (1962) before it, along with Albert Finney and a magnificent supporting cast carrying it along at break neck speed. It also had an outstanding look but more importantly a heart and vitality that Lyndon lacks barring it from the pantheon status that its look commands.",6,3,7,24 December 2018
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick out of Ammo with Full Metal Jacket
","By the time Stanley Kubrick made Full Metal Jacket it was evident the once enormously talented director had lost a step or two. Barry Lyndon was a beautiful bore to endure and his adaption of Stephen King's The Shining was drained of terror. Full Metal continued the slide but did not end it. The worst was yet to come with Eyes Wide Shut. Jacket is Kubrick's late entry to a long line of Viet Nam films that followed the unpopular war. The first half takes place on Paris Island where Marine recruits are put through basic training. It is a brutal and suspenseful first half made all the more powerful by Lee Ermey's intense DI. Once overseas the film founders badly. Kubrick keeps his camera moving with elaborate pans and tracking shots but his actors become lifeless caricatures and psychos, a rich pastiche of ugly Americans and moronic commanders. In Strangelove there was a dark comic touch that made it work. Here it only shows an out of touch artist trying to be relevant and hip with a paler Apocalypse Now take that was done (and done a lot better) eight years earlier. The last half hour really exacerbates matters with a scene that concerns routing a sniper. To maintain suspense this long is impossible in such a situation and it is proved here. There is also a contrived denouement to the whole scene that rings hollow. Put another director's moniker on it and the crit's would give it passable grades as an anti-war film with a touch too much self indulgence and sluggish editing. But since it's Stanley's watch what you say. Well since it is Stanley's I give Metal a five instead of a six since the great cutting edge director of classic original film work as Dr.Strangelove, 2001, A Space Odyssey and Clockwork Orange followed this time instead of taking the lead as he has done in the past. In this case with a less than impressive effort that borrows heavily from some of his past works.",5,6,15,4 June 2007
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Nice add, fair product.
","Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) is not the easiest person to live with. Far from a Town and Country mom she is acrimoniously divorced and had a rocky relationship with a young daughter who has been murdered by someone still on the loose. Frustrated with local authorities who she sees dragging their feet regarding the investigation she rents three abandoned billboards along a stretch of a secondary road and disses the local authority, a popular chief (Woody Harrelson) with terminal cancer. Town folk are less than pleased with his treatment and matters escalate when a venal Barney Fife like deputy oversteps his authority.In Billboards writer, director, English import Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Six Shooter) drags his steamer trunk of gratuitous violence and incredulous plot twist to middle America tightening somewhat the bloodletting faucet but the credulity once again stretches beyond the borders of realism which diminishes the film beyond repair. Francis McDormand's uncompromising Mildred simply carries the film from end to end with a stubborn resolve. You find yourself sympathizing but never really embracing her due to her emotional myopia. A plausible conclusion might make her the villain in the piece, the townsfolk certainly feel that way. Sam Rockwell's goober like Dixon is over the top early but eventually settles well into his transition period but the stretch is too broad the damage for the most part done to make it convincing.Where Billboards wobbles from the outset is tourist McDonagh's approach to the community. Most of the locals are portrayed as ignorant clichés and as in past films he employs copious violence and bloodletting with minimal injury. Add the fact Mildred commits about a half dozen major felonies before heading off into the sunset with Dixon makes it more than clear McDonagh has not left his preposterous storytelling behind in 3 Billboards that never fully settles as absurdist dark comedy or stark drama.",5,3,8,3 December 2017
Gone Baby Gone," When offbeat is awful.
","Ben Affleck matches his wooden acting talent as a first time director with this shabby attempt to match in mystery and atmosphere Mystic River. Sloppily edited, filled with cliché performances and tortured plot twists it rings false from beginning to end.A child has been kidnapped in a rough clannish section of Boston called Dorcester. It's clear that the folks in this hardscrabble part of town have little faith or trust in the cops so the family hire a pair of local private eyes to get some answers. The two then form an uneasy partnership with a couple of veteran detectives as they pursue a rogues gallery of low lives to get some answers. It makes for some very haphazard storytelling on the part of director Affleck.Keeping things deliberately confusing this patchwork quilt of a mystery is poorly stitched together as scenes bump into each other rather than transition smoothly. GBG jolts the audience in more than one scene but in Affleck's incapable hands the action wanders and the actors remain unconvincing. He seems content to allow his music score to telegraph the emotions of actors who offer little more than solemn stares.Offbeat casting can sometimes revive tired genre types and instill something fresh into the recipe but Casey Affleck looks like a runaway from a boy scout troop confining his performance to cold expression and side glances. PI partner and girlfriend played by Michelle Monaghan does little more than stand around waiting to jump in a quarry. The chemistry between the two is non-existent. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris simply punch a clock with Freeman under and Harris over acting. As the abducted child's mother Amy Ryan is excellent but it is the only bright spot to be found in this oafish production that flounders from start to finish.",4,1,2,30 March 2009
American Hustle," The hustle is in the making.
","There are a quartet of excellent performances to be found in this fast and loose re-telling of what led to the famous ABSCAM sting involving congressman and corrupt Jersey pols back in the 80s but under the guidance of David O Russell's feverish, erratic direction the film implodes into improbable silliness before its pat happily ever after finish.Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale)is a career con artist with a chain of dry cleaning stores (how appropriate) and a phony investment business that scams desperate investors with the promise of a heavy return. He meets Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) a Jersey stripper who can produce a fetching English accent and the business takes off as well as their intimate relationship. When she gets busted by a hyper intense FBI agent Richie DiMaso ( Bradley Cooper) they agree to working a sting that starts out small but mushrooms big time when the DC pols develop a taste for some illicit green waved in front of them. Mob involvement raises the stakes.Leading man Bale is outstanding as the romantic oily con artist with a flamboyant comb over, pot belly and heart of gold that fails to ring true in the long run by going soft with his mark a crooked Camden mayor, Sol Politto (cinematographer homage?) another sweetheart of a guy with a Brady bunch family, including an adopted black kid, greedy for bucks but all in the name of altruism. Adams, Cooper, Jeremy Renner as the mayor and Jennifer Lawrence as Irv's off the wall wife more than hold their own with the superb Bale but the projectory of the story begins to lose thrust halfway through as Russell struggles to amp up the suspense with smoke, mirrors and a hint of slapstick.Hustle pads itself heavily with music video to give it an energy and many scenes crackle with it as agent DiMaso, Irving and Sydney play a sexual tension cat and mouse game with each other. But Russell as he did in his last overheated exercise Silver Linings Playbook fails to maintain a consistent mood, vacillating between tension and humor to tell his story making it uneven and ultimately unconvincing as it ties up loose ends in a mawkish way with Russell sacrificing verisimilitude in favor of making his loathsome characters warm and fuzzy for audience consumption. Just like Irving's bilked clients you only find out at the end you are the one who has been had.",6,12,25,23 December 2013
Fargo," Fargo is Flawless
","Fargo is probably the last American Film masterpiece of the Twentieth Century and the last 25 years. Highly original and imaginative it is a depressing tale told in a dark comic style with flesh and blood characters intricately and smoothly connected with dialog and plot twists all brilliantly conceived by the brothers Coen.Sleazy car dealer Jerry Lundergaard hatches a plan to have his wife kidnapped so he can pocket some of the ransom his emasculating father in-law will have to fork over. Through one of his mechanics he gets the name of a low life who might be interested and travels to Fargo to work out the plan. Things go awry from the outset though and soon the cold snowy landscape is littered with dead bodies. Solving the case is left up to a last trimester pregnant Sheriff from Brainerd, Minnesota who initially comes across as a little slow on the draw.Fargo is flawlessly constructed with subplots girding the storyline, enriching characterization and sharply calibrating the suspenseful pace. The frozen north setting is a refreshing change from big city and vacation land locales that dominate feature films and the Coens expertly put it to use to create mood, evoke humor and accent imagery. It is the best use of snow since Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller.William Macy as Jerry takes the car salesman stereotypes to new lows with one of the most memorable cloyingly unctuous characters in film history as he dismantles his family in pursuit of wealth. Whether trying to tack on extras to customers or keeping police at bay while surrounded in a motel room he remains steadfast in deceptive practice until the end. As the Sheriff Frances McDormand evolves from small town cop to Colombo subtlety and successfully without fanfare while Coen economically brings more depth and mystery to her with dry comic snapshots of her married life and a meeting with an old school chum. As one of the blundering kidnappers Steve Buscemi is a motormouth of comic complaint while his taciturn, hypochondrial partner played by Peter Stomare (a lot more grounded in reality than the Frankenstein creation running amok in the Coen's No Country for Old Men) is icily terrifying.Fargo is the Coens' best film to date. They fell into a malaise after The Big Lebowski with heavy handed comedies (The Lady Killers, Intolerable Cruelty), dependence on charming movie star George Clooney as well as a flaccid and forgettable foray into black and white (The Man Who Wasn't There) before going Oscar with the slow moving overrated Old Country, followed by the praise worthy acerbic screwball comedy Burn After Reading. Even with their failures they had more to offer than quality work of tamer directors by offering razzle dazzle camera work and original off-beat characters. Taking chances they sometimes pushed the envelope beyond credulity but with Fargo they give us a perfect measure of style and realism with a dark comic soul that is rich in detail and perception of this thing known as the human comedy.",10,7,10,23 May 2009
Nightcrawler," Gyleenaal makes your skin crawl.
","Jake Gylennall channels Norman Bates and TV news gets cuffed around in Nightcrawler an absorbing tale of cold blooded ambition. Shot in an around the neo noir capital of LA Gyllenhaal as Louis Bloom slithers through its dark underbelly with a disturbing detachment that garners him the attention and admiration of local station directors and talking heads who live by the coda 'If it bleeds it leads.' Bloom, a petty criminal out ripping off fencing and manhole covers one evening comes upon an auto accident being covered by free lance videographers and decides to give it a shot. With a second rate video camera and first rate chutzpah he barrels into action, crossing police barriers and getting what others can't. His work now leads the newscast and he parleys that into bedding a ratings desperate news director Nina (Renee Russo)and hot red muscle car to roam LA after dark in search of carnage. When he is first on the scene to a house invasion with three dead he gets the money shots but also withholds evidence in hopes of stage managing an even bigger exclusive.Gyllenhaal is annoyingly excellent as the creepy Bloom, a focused pragmatic, misfit void of empathy and compassion. He may lack social skills and border on psychotic but his self confidence and deductive reasoning remains dispassionately sound. In a strong supporting role Rene Russo's news manager may be more grounded but she is just as jaded and perverse as Bloom as she plays fast and loose with the truth for ratings.Writer director Dan Gilroy does a fine job of maintaining suspense while hammering home the theme of the media run amok. In addition cinematographer Dan Elswit's night shots and fractured hand held imagery inform and provide a suitable backdrop to Bloom's task at hand. It is the highly effective and disturbing performance of Gyllenhaal though that remains at the center of Nightcrawler, elevating it to an above average thriller with some hints of Network thrown in.",7,0,2,6 November 2014
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Williams sole energy source in 'feel good' Nam film.
","In Good Morning Viet Nam Robin Williams takes his stand up act to SEA as an irreverent DJ. A mild mawkish comedy under the mundane style of Barry Levinson who seems content to just turn the zany comic loose it never attains much of an energy level outside Williams inconsistent rants. Transferred from Greece to Nam to DJ and entertain the troops Adrien Cronauer has little respect for the men running the war and he subversively gets it across to the grunts on the ground fighting it who bond with him. His superiors find his attitude trying however and take steps, one very cynical and drastic, to remove him.In his prime Williams took his wacky and irreverent comedy routines and incorporated it into a 'Mr. Wonderful' persona in a series of films in which he championed the underdog and vanquished the big bad establishment with his rapier wit. Good Morning may well be the best of the lot with an ideal occupation and situation for Williams to be in but director Levinson brings nothing in terms of a look or a cohesive storyline to the picture. Injecting flaccid montages to accompany the era's music he more or less abdicates his directorship in favor of Robbie coming up with comic gold. There's some dust to be mined but away from the mike Williams drowns in schmaltzy interplay with the child like Asians( courtesy of Levinson's hackneyed patronizing) bridging the gap like LBJ and MacNamara could only dream of. Good Morning Viet Nam is little more than a stage for Williams routine and incite, something you can catch on a late night show in less time and for less money.",5,3,4,7 September 2011
Burn After Reading," Confederacy of Dunces
","Burn After Reading is a smart dark comedy about a cross section of DC area paranoids and functional idiots who seem determined to bungle their way to self destruction. Redeemable qualities are hard to find in any of these self absorbed but engagingly quirky characters who actively deceive partners while unconsciously living an existence of self deception themselves. It can and does make for a lethal combination.CIA operative Osborne Cox refuses a demotion and quits his post much to the chagrin of his ice cold wife whose having an affair with Harry Pffarer a US Marshall and a sex addict. Cox decides to write his memoirs but has a disk of material lifted by his wife whose about to begin divorce proceedings against him. The disk is then lost at a gym where two brainless, body conscious employees hatch a bribery scheme against Cox. Matters are further complicated when Harry begins an affair with Linda Litsky, one of the extortionists. Before you know it the CIA and the Russians are involved.This is the sharpest film the talented team Coen has made since The Big Lebowski. By insinuating much and revealing little they slyly keep the audience off balance throughout with a blend of comic detours and sudden violence. Their signature unpredictable style is well in evidence as they refashion stark characters of similar plots and manipulate star power to their advantage by casting Hollywoods two reigning hearthrobs, George Clooney and Brad Pitt to play narcissistic nitwits, which they do with aplomb.Francis McDormand as the dense Linda, John Malkovich as Cox, Tilda Swinton as his wife and Richard Jenkins as the gym owner are all letter perfect as well. Peripheral characters also register heavily, providing the Coens room for some Swiftian social commentary. A cosmetic surgeon, a divorce lawyer and two high ranking clueless CIA officers who confuse the audience and themselves in an hilarious epilogue say reams about today's society.Burn After Reading displays the Coens once again at the top of their game with an original and refreshing work that avoids the formulaic boilerplate and works outside the Hollywood box. It's visually tame for the Coen's but edited and paced in a way that demands such restraint, accenting both the suspense and the comedy with subtle movements that hold the same weight and impact of some of their grander flourishes. In doing so they have re-stated their claim to being America's best film makers.",8,2,7,15 September 2008
Baby Driver," Baby Driver ends up in the ditch.
","With more than it's fair share of suspense and thrills this high intensity but somewhat far fetched heist film roars right out of the box, begins to sputter midway and breaks down in True Romance fashion by the credits. Talk about being taken for a ride.Errand boy get away driver Baby (Ansel Elgort)has a severe hearing problem ameliorated by inspiring music that has him clicking on all cylinders whether picking up coffee or leading the chase; but it must be the right music. He owes big time to mobster Doc(Kevin Spacey) and is paying him back as a quirky wheel man that creeps out his cohorts. He finds a girl and wants out but Doc is not about to let that happen with over an hour to go of road mayhem and murder still on the meter.One has to suspend a lot to get through this pile-up created by writer director Edgar Wright with characters lacking depth or consistency. Doc, the cold merciless brains doesn't show much of them when selecting psycho killers to pull jobs or at least be adorned in intimidating tattoos and making sure the 'team' mix is at loggerheads in the planning stages. It gets even worse as Doc gets caught up in the cringing mawkishness that infects the film at its conclusion. Wright's free form absurdity extends of course to the Duracell battery villain (Jon Hamm in this case, Javier Bardem and Heath Ledger were actually given Oscars for their resilience in the past) a prerequisite these days for insipid films that move in and out of reality and constantly remind us we are watching a movie bordering on computer game. In one of the film's better chase scenes we have Baby on foot tortuously eluding police only to catch up with Houdini Hamm who has managed to extricate himself from being surrounded by cops over the same period. Gratuitous violence is plentiful but in Wright's hip world glossed over at trial and trumped by the fact he returned a woman's pocket book among other things allowing for our anti-hero to be out of jail in no time riding off in a 59 Chevy convertible with his girl in glorious black and white. The fact he participated in at least three brutal robberies resulting in multiple casualties and death is a non-issue in films of this ilk. Hence, the characters never progress beyond durable outline while the story remains repetitive, predictable and pretentious, its labored breathing depending heavily on pop nostalgia and the occasional rush of adrenaline with Baby at the wheel. Baby Driver is violent fluff.",5,39,76,8 July 2017
The Caine Mutiny," Bogart and Ferrer keep Caine Afloat
","In The Caine Mutiny Humphrey Bogart gives one of his finest performances as Captain Queeg, a by the book, mentally unstable commander of an eyesore tub during world war two. The shame of any fleet when Queeg assumes command, the Caine has a rather laid back crew and officer staff. Determined to get the vessel in ship shape Queeg alienates the crew with his hard taskmaster ways. Paranoia begins to take hold of the captain as he drives the crew to be the best they can be. An incident involving strawberries begins to expose Queeg's instability. When he makes glaring mistakes during a typhoon that nearly sinks the ship he is relieved of his command by Maryk , the first mate after he confers with fellow officers. Back in dry dock, Queeg accuses Maryk of mutiny and demands his court martial.When it sticks to the main plot The Caine Mutiny is an an absorbing story of disintegration and betrayal in the military. Bogart's collapse is almost too painful to watch as he rages against perceived slights to his command, close-ups registering a deep emotional pain as we witness the tragic last act of Queeg's naval career. Jose Ferrer as the lawyer that dismantles Queeg on the stand leads a solid supporting cast that also features Van Johnson and Fred MacMurray. Ferrer, sober and drunk acts as the conscience of the film with two fine speeches in the final scenes.A romantic sub-plot weakens the film and a big patriotic send off detracts from the climax, but Bogart's Queeg makes Caine well worth the cruise.",7,0,1,5 January 2008
The Shining," Tracks to nowhere.
","Laying down more tracking shots than the Union Pacific did rail during its cross continental building Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is an empty horror flic rich in production design and due to his methodical style void most of the way of suspense. For nearly two and a half hours Kubrick drags his camera around the empty surroundings of a deserted off season hotel and its grounds inexorably building up suspense but failing to follow through as he lets scenes drag on endlessly with superfluous dialog and hollow disjointed action.Writer Jack Torrance along with his wife and child take on the duty of caring for a grand Colorado hotel that eventually becomes closed off from the outside world. The son Danny has special powers that allow him to see the past as well as well as channel thoughts of others. As the days pass Jack slowly becomes unhinged and Danny's abilities become more vivid and gruesome. Meanwhile wife Wendy's hand wringing increases but it's clear that only a bloodbath will be able to satiate a patient audience slowed down by Stanley's innocuous attention to detail which impedes the pacing.Kubrick's visual style was at good as it got in the last half of the century and in The Shining we have some bravura compositions backed by a muscular score and soundtrack that ratchets up the suspense but fails to sustain it as Kubrick plods along with superfluous tracking shots and slow zooms that add nothing but time to the story and loosen tautness.Nicholson is a superb chilling presence but Shelly Duvall as his suffering and clueless wife is all wrong and the chemistry between the two is non-existent from the outset. It is left up to Nicholson's sick sense of humor to give some spring to the (you guessed it) drawn out finale that salvages moments from this polished bore.The Shining is a shining example of a master filmmaker out of his genre depth, slumming with his pedigree and being incapable of delivering the goods done so well and for a lot less by fellow directors who would not be mentioned in the same breath as this giant. The thing is he could have learned a lot from them.",5,5,11,17 April 2010
The Battle of Algiers," Battle still rages with power.
","Four decades after its release The Battle of Algiers remains as emotionally powerful and timely as ever. Its semi documentary look and universal theme addressing a people's right to run their own country and not some foreign colonizer or more pertinent to today's front page, despotic dictator, has not lost an ounce of its urgency or punch as the same part of the world including Algeria itself wrestles with self determination. Street thief Ali Lapointe is doing time in an Algerian jail when he gets religion after witnessing the execution of an independence fighter. On the outside he attempts to enlist with the FLN but is first tested to measure the depth of his commitment. Passing that he becomes part of a cell that encourages strikes against the French oppressor but when this fails the cell turns to violence. Career officer Colonel Mathieu is given command to subdue the rebelling Arabs and he does so by imposing greater restrictions and resorting to torture of Casbah residents and suspects.Director Giullio Pontecervo's cold sober story telling rhythmically carried along by Ennio Morricone's score and cinematographer Marcello Gatti's lensing of the vertical Casbah battle field in all its restrictive claustrophobia makes for an ideal stage to depict an oppressed people brought to the edge with nowhere to turn. While Pontecervo shows both sides resorting to atrocity he clearly sympathizes with the Arab cause and takes every opportunity to make French paratroopers look like Nazi Africa Corps and act like Gestapo. Conversely he does not glamorize (or infect the film with a movie star ) the cold dispatch of Ali and his compatriots instead leaving it up to the immoral situation to make its case.Mirroring the Viet Nam conflict during its release and used as a training film by terrorists around the globe since then The Battle of Algiers remains a provocative and absorbing watch that should continue to resonate not only as a call to arms but as an example of cinema at its most powerful.",9,0,1,21 March 2011
Silver Linings Playbook," Meandering manipulative mayhem.
","If you are going to make a comedy romance where the lead suffers from violent bi-polar disorder then it might not be a bad idea to make sure the headliner has kind blue eyes and sensitive features ala Bradley Cooper to keep it light and get you over the rough patches as he does in Silver Linings Play Book. Cooper who may well be the 21st century version of Jimmy Stewart does a commendable job of doing so but director David O Russell has a hard time getting his recipe of dash's of other films (Footloose, Last Tango, Saturday Night Fever) to reach comic heights because of the three hundred pound gorilla in the room, the illness with its violent overtones as a comedy launch pad.After teacher Pat Solitano finds his wife handing out favors to a fellow educator he goes nuclear and nearly beats him to death. Institutionalized for eight months his mother signs him out against advice and the volatile young man heads home to Philly to win his wife back. It doesn't take long for Pat Jr. to act out again with a half a dozen infractions that should send him right back to the bin but it seems the enormous patience of friends and the community (Philly mind you) is full of forgive and forget. Enlisting Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence)to help in his crusade he grudgingly agrees to enter a dance competition with her. With issues of her own the two form an abrasive alliance.Silver Linings breaks from the box fast with loose cannon Pat's unpredictability and unsettling behavior direction yet to be established but once it settles into it's comedy slot it is little more than a hyper When Harry met Sally. Lawrence and Cooper have some nice go rounds but outcome is telegraphed well in advance and the humor to help get us there runs its course fast.To give the film its energy Russell shoots most of it in disorienting close-up with a fair amount of middle of the street restaurant and home scenes that lack verisimilitude in their drama or comedy edge with their sarcastic punch lines.As Pat's parents Jackie Weaver spends most of the film welling up and wringing her hands while Robert DiNero as his bookie dad plays it with a little more intensity than his Focker dad. It is a terrible waste as we see glimmers of the greatness that was Di Nero in scenes played as straight drama instead of comedy between father and son may have made for a far better film with lighter box office returns. Russell remains intent however in coming up with 'the feel good comedy of the year' with a touch of edge but Silver Linings Playbook double bladed topic, silly comedy out of serious illness is ultimately a dull swipe at it.",5,3,8,8 February 2013
Dallas Buyers Club," Modern day plague anti-hero.
","During the early dark days of the Aids epidemic in America the powers that be took scant notice or chose to ignore the phenomena that was wiping out a certain segment of the population ( needle sharing druggies, gay men) at an appalling rate. Given the social standing of both groups in the eighties the government refused to sound the alarm bell, allowing instead for the FDA to take its time approving other drugs beyond the hard on the system AZT. Working at that time as a state health investigator in that field I encountered dozens of HIV positive individuals who claimed it made them sicker than they were and some stopped taking the med. South of the border in Mexico there were drugs proving to be more efficacious without FDA approval. Enter Ron Woodruff rodeo electrician,con man and hedonist who decided to do something about it when faced with the deadly diagnosis.In The Dallas Buyers Club Matt McConaughey creates a vivid warts and all portrait of the man who refused to take no for an answer and it is by far the best performance of his career. Painfully thin and skeletal looking McConnaghy's sickly visage belies a healthy determination to fight the system's apathy in an offbeat David and Goliath struggle. By employing his con man skills to circumvent the law and distribute the unapproved meds to the infected he starts the Dallas Buyers Club out of a dubious motel by selling memberships. The DEA however does not take it lying down and it results in raids and court battles.McConaughey dominates the picture as the surly pugnacious Don Quixote tilting at the government with a solid assist from Jared Leto playing his infected, drug addled transsexual Sancho Panza. As a physician and Woodruff's only ally working within the system Jennifer Garner comes across flat and dispassionate whiffing on more than one scene with McConaughey and disapproving colleagues.Things lag slightly towards the end but director Jean Marc Valee states his case plainly and solidly without hysteria on this one time hot topic that has cooled considerably over the years as the disease is no longer an automatic death sentence due to advancement in meds and education. You may quibble about the size of Ron Woodruff's contribution and his unorthodox methodology but there is no denying his effort to help a desperate population in the darkest days of the disease as anything else other than courageous.",8,4,6,4 January 2014
Now You See Me," The magic is in getting you to swallow this tripe.
","There is a little too much suspension of disbelief asked for in this slicker than snot heat and light fiasco featuring four snotty lads (yeah, I know ones a helium voiced young lady but they are known as the four horsemen) in this fantasy caper film celebrating smugness. It gets tiresome fast.Four illusionists hook up to pull off one daydream moronic wild goose chase as they go from Vegas to The Big Easy make a statement for the people before going on to New York City for the grand finale. Did I mention the side trip to Paris? Meanwhile they are dogged by a bullheaded irrational cop in need of a shave. There's also some French pastry, slender and pouting, along for the ride.Jesse Eisenberg leads a cast of smart ass punks who easily outwit the NYPD and FBI performing magic all over town such as creating a rollover on the Washington Bridge packed with traffic and no one getting killed or I believe injured. Amazing. I realize you have to concede something inside a dream palace but this is not worth it. It's nothing but a slick con game trying to blind you by its light of insipid jump cutting and monotonous merry go round panning theatrics in an attempt to give the en masse cast of bores (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine just need walkers) charisma. Not an ounce.",3,6,12,2 July 2013
Jackie," Funereal pace, erratic performance buries Jackie.
","With nearly the entire world privy to this historical display of collective grief the film Jackie attempts to get underneath the moment and images burned into the memories of all who lived through those days as well as the countless re-tellings over the last half century. It is not a pleasant portrait of an icon who showed remarkable courage and dignity in the midst of a mind numbing tragedy but it is an uncharted angle that is daring in theory but mealy and imbalanced in the telling.Centered around that dark day in Dallas and the period of national mourning following, Jackie presents a varied portrait of the President's widow both weak and strong, sober and medicated, profound and petty. As Mrs. Kennedy, Natalie Portman does not shirk from painting the ideal First Lady beyond the public facade as bitter and understandably disoriented much of the time resembling a more dictatorial Nancy Reagan as she stage manages the funeral plans and the legacy of her husband arguing in hush tones with brother in law Bobby and officials while the shady Johnson people get ready to set up shop. Portman's performance sways from perfect to strident displaying the grace and poise she was famed for while mimicking at times the breathy Jackie with lines meant to emphasize the famous voice that gave us a tour of the White House. It is an undeniably interesting take on a fascinating figure but the film relies on how well we are informed of this event and the films most emotionally powerful moment is to be found in the eyes of Caroline being told of her father's death. Pablo Lorraine's direction remains low key most of the way, milking the assassination a little more than he should but understandable given it is the film's only chaotic moment with the rest of the film submerged in stoicism and deep melancholy. Along with writer Noah Oppenheim he infers that JFK would have saved the world while the Johnson's with few words are visually portrayed as evil, particularly a dour calcified looking Lady Bird played by an actress 20 years her senior at the time. Whether the creators were attempting to draw a comparison between the vitality of the outgoing administration or make a smug comparison to Lansbury's Manchurian Candidate it is an unwarranted cheap shot. Lorraine is to be commended for not taking the easier highly admired general view of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, instead making her human with the same petty foibles we possess. But in his sober telling he moves too slowly as Portman presents us with an icon that perhaps is impossible to define or want to humanize by replacing deification with speculation. They should have 'printed the legend' instead.",5,0,2,2 March 2017
No Country for Old Men," Old Men is Old Coen
","The Coen brothers are on firmer and more familiar territory with this Texas noir based on the Cormac Mc Carthy novel. Trailer park resident Llewellyn Moss stumbles upon the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad in the Texas desert and makes off with the fortune in cash. A machine like but philosophical psychopathic killer is soon in pursuit. An aging sheriff takes up pursuit of both with little success as bodies begin to litter the territory.The film is filled with some highly suspenseful moments and for the most part remains that way for much of the film. The pace maintains itself by shifting back and forth between three characters with a detour here and there to introduce other players and plot twists. The diversions and turns eventually become wearisome though and Country starts to slow down.No Country is vintage Coen. After the Big Lebowski (a worthy follow-up to their masterpiece Fargo) the brothers seemed to have lost their edge with four lackluster efforts. Country recalls their superb earlier works such as Raising Arizona, Blood Simple and Fargo and therein lies part of the problem. A lot of Country has scenes and characters directly lifted from these works. The Coen's are masters at oblique dialogue that gets to the heart of the matter and many scenes resonate with these elements giving them both tension and humor. Their originality and unpredictability of action and character can raise suspense in the most benign of settings. Their heroes and villains are complex. They are not 24-7 people of virtue or mindless cruelty. Their quirks flesh out and bring depth to their character thus increasing the possible directions of the plot.Tommy Lee Jones as the Sheriff is a burned out Andy of Mayberry moving from middle age crisis to old age and the uncertainty of retirement, always a step behind the bad guys. Jones conveys his fatigue and dogged determination in a fine measured way. Josh Brolin is even better as Moss who goes to great lengths to hold onto the money. Brolin, who stole acting honors in American Gangster as a corrupt jersey cop does so here as well as a stoic Texan. Based on these two roles alone he could be Americas best working actor. Woody Harrelson is badly miscast as a contract killer in a throw away role.What ultimately makes No Country for Old Men a disappointment is the handling of the villain, Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. The film, grounded in a dusty realism slowly starts to fall apart as Chigurh moves across the landscape like Boris Karloff offing locals with an unconcealed customized weapon. Even after a dozen people have been eliminated by Chigurh you get the impression that only Sheriff Bell is looking for him since Chigurh has no problem moving freely about spreading mayhem. The fascinating character that Chigurh is (he seems to be searching for the meaning of life as well as the stolen money) at the film's beginning degenerates into a Schwarzenegian Terminator manqué by the final reel and this strains the credulity of the movie beyond its breaking point.With Country the brothers Coen may be out of the rut that plagued there last few works but their wheels are still spinning.",6,43,84,22 November 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Character assassination
","New Zealand director Andrew Dominik breaks many genre rules with this unconventional western about the illustrious outlaw Jesse James and his assassin Bob Ford. Better he should have broken something else (let's start with his type-writer) in this turgid, sluggish western that moves slower than a Conestoga wagon through the Badlands in the 19th century.The first rule he forgoes is in ignoring the axiom that Western characters are men of few words. The James brothers are in the twilight of their careers and this last gang they have assembled is a band of dullards and morons that have trouble putting a sentence together in between long vacant stares. The film opens promisingly enough as the brothers plan a train robbery in a stark wilderness setting. Here Bob Ford, the delusional, James worshiping sidekick attempts to inveigle his way into the good graces of Frank (played with a fine stoic, resignation by Sam Shepard) who will have none of it.Casey Affleck's speech and tick affected Ford is interesting for the first half hour of the film before he becomes downright annoying for the rest of it. Nevertheless, brother Jesse takes him under his wing and for over two hours we are given obvious hints from the pursuit of fame to latent homosexuality as reasons for Ford's ultimate act of treachery. Director Dominik clearly loves cowboy movies. He manages to plagiarize (in a decent film this would be called homage) from westerns good and bad. The Searchers, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, The Left handed Gun, The Great Train Robbery and Dead Man are among others all hinted at. Visually it has some striking moments but overall the cinematography is uneven. At ninety minutes this would have been a bad film. At two and one half hours it becomes a tortuous one. While the heavy handed Dominick deserves most of the blame, producer and actor Brad Pitt should have strangled this project at birth. His comatose performance of Jesse is all pose and little substance and as producer he green lighted this soporific monstrosities running time. For more engrossing, entertaining, better acted and filmed evocations of the James legend I strongly suggest you see The 1939 Henry King Jesse James with Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda and the 1973 Philip Kauffman film The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid.",3,10,20,20 October 2007
To Rome With Love," Woody fiddles while Rome fails to spark.
","Woody Allen's European tour continues, stopping this time in Rome to tell a quartet of unconnected stories that run from the absurd to listless. It's mishmash Allen in search of Fellini and it gets lost in translation fast. Working four story lines Rome opens swiftly as Allen inter-cuts the pieces but once established they all begin to bog down in vapid dialog, the pace loses energy and the payoff on all four vignettes found to be lacking. It's like channel surfing four mundane TV comedies incapable of holding your attention beyond five minutes.The cast has the usual big names to put in twenty minutes each with Penelope Cruz back to play her hot, high wind Mediterranean bombshell, Alec Baldwin whispering and doing the same things he does in commercials, a cadaverous Judy Davis acting and looking uncomfortable in her own skin, Roberto Benigni doing Roberto Benigni from two decades back and Allen himself showing hints of dementia. Allen's writing is both capricious and lame as he makes observations about the price of fame, the paparazzi, youthful infatuation and singing in the shower with a heavy hand. There's plenty of Fellini homage (Amacord, La Dolce Vita) going so far as to lift the entire plot from The White Sheik for one of the story lines. Little surprise it is the best of the segments but that's not saying much for this Rome ruin.",5,3,8,9 August 2012
Bridesmaids," Ladies leveling the playing field.
","Why should guys have all the ungoverned gross out laughs in films seems to be the intent of Bridesmaids a very funny response to the men behaving silly Hangover franchise. What amounts to a girls road trip picture is filled with some gut busting moments. Annie's (Kristin Wiig ) lifetime buddy Lillian (Maya Rudolph) asks her to be her maid of honor. Cash strapped Annie just coming off the failure of her cake business is honored but also perplexed on how to keep the cost down but remains determined to give her friend the best she can afford. A well heeled other maid (Rose Byrne) however attempts to assume Annie's duties with the two tight rope walking a precarious civility and developing a fierce competition. Out gunned Annie's attempts to keep things under control with disastrous but hilarious results.Bridesmaids is filled with comic moments of shockingly funny scenes with the diffuse group of maids and bride to be all pitching into the laugh pool. Wiig does a fine job of embarrassing herself in scene after scene while Rose Byrne as her poised nemesis does an equally fine job of stoking her insecurity and fostering havoc. In the role of the requisite funny fat guy ala Zach Galifinakis, Jack Black etc. Mellissa Mc Carthey fits the role perfectly with the same self assured dead pan flare.While the cast and the situations do hold there own in the zany department with guy versions Bridesmaids begins to drag with time outs for melancholy reflection and heart to hearts stretching the film beyond two hours resulting in diluting the full comic thrust and while it prevents Bridesmaids from becoming the bride of all comedies there are more than enough belly laughs for a good time to be had by all.",7,0,2,30 September 2011

It's like looking at the Macy's Christmas window decorations one city block after the next as Anderson piles on his colorfully precious detail from end to end while dragging the anemic plot behind it.Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) , head concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel and member in good standing with the legion of Crossed Keys is known far and wide for his close attention to detail and the extras (gigolo) he provides to one foot in the grave dowagers who check in. When one turns up dead she leaves him a precious painting and perhaps more but her Boris Badenov looking family will have none of this and H is charged with her murder instead. Along with faithful Lobby Boy, Zero, he sets out to clear his name and unmask the real murderers.All form and no content, Hotel is rich in color and set design seducing you briefly with its cleverness and play land look but with its one cylinder storyline engine it hardly advances at all as Anderson bombards the audience with endless dead pan compositions and sorry slapstick performed by arch characters and special guest stars. The precision, detail and the promise of its look simply fails to support its meager drawn out plot and by the halfway mark you get tired playing with the same toys going in circles.Ralph Fiennes as the perspicacious Gustave brings grace and more than a touch of sophistication to his charming and comic role but the rest of the cast is mass caricature that wears thin after initial contact and The Grand Hotel Budapest goes from four star to Motel 6 in no time.",6,8,18,31 March 2014
Gone Girl," Fun house satire, suspenseful but lengthy.
","Ben Affleck's wooden ways work to his advantage in this suspenseful missing wife tale based on the bestseller of the same name. Going up against a determined and ambitious mate his dim abilities prove to work to his advantage in the role as the craftier wife played with homicidal aplomb by Rosalind Pike runs circles around him and the community.Nick and Amy are about to observe their fifth wedding anniversary in less the best of circumstances where the home dynamic has become frayed over time. Upon arriving home one day he finds she has disappeared with evidence of perhaps a struggle. He reports her missing to authorities but becomes the focus of a possible murder investigation instead as he contradicts himself and evidence he can't explain pops up. Meanwhile Amy makes herself as scarce as possible by going trailer park chic as Ben squirms before authorities and the bright light of the media with a vile Nancy Grace type (played with unctuous relish by Missi Pyle) leads the attack. When the resourceful Amy runs into a road block with a couple of low rent operators she is forced to restructure her diabolical plan and works a former paramour into the scheme (Neil Patrick Harris), raising the stakes.Gone Girl is part Gothic horror part parody of todays rabid 24 hour news cycle and internet village descending on a befuddled working stiff being pummeled by a comely harridan who has done her homework with a vindictive zeal not seen around these parts since Glenn Close boiled the rabbit in fatal attraction. Affleck's vapid acting chops work well with his clueless character as he fumbles over his alibi again and again as the focused and out of sight Amy makes life a living hell for him. While Affleck garners audience sympathy it is Pike's ruthless Amy that fascinates and lights up the screen with energy and venom.Director Fincher's deliberate style lags occasionally and the plot reeks of incredulity at times but with logic suspended he delivers more than a fair share of powerfully edited tension filled scenes balanced against a sardonic take on media and society. When combined with a villainess for the times Gone Girl is one fine entertainment.",8,1,6,3 November 2014
Django Unchained," Eastwood in shades.
","Displaying the same disturbed imagination of a twelve year old that has made him the darling of hipster film watchers Quentin Tarantino's Django is filled with all the predictable heavy handed juvenility one has come to expect from the 'vaunted' writer director. It is his typical mix of gratuitous violence and sadism, hints of humor and a script sprinkled, no plastered with his two favorite spicy words. Marinated with heavy hand and pretension it is a slow go from the outset buoyed along by intervals of explosions and gun play to keep you awake for it's nearly three hour run.Bounty hunter/dentist King Schultz (Chris Waltz) buys ( in a very violent fashion naturally) slave Django (Jaime Foxx) from some surly traders and sets out to train him as an assistant in the bounty trade. It becomes a lucrative partnership for the pair but Django yearns for the return of his wife Brunhilde (a subtle Wagnerian touch by QT) and a strong desire to shoot surly unkempt Southerners. Arriving at the plantation of Calvin Candy (aptly called Candyland) in Mississippi he finds her and they try to create a ruse to win her release. House slave Stephen (Sam Jackson) however suspects something is up and it leads to the same blue print mayhem to be found in Tarantino's films, in this case a Kill Bill rehash with lead instead of swords.As Django, Foxx mopes and Eastwood's most of the way while the rest of the cast overacts ferociously, particularly in scenes between Candy and Stephen. The rest of the cast is relegated to being as unctuous as possible with pull cords reciting the same two words.For Tarantino fans it will probably not disappoint with its lusty bloodletting, tough talk and folks getting blown up. But with little to add to a canon of work fraught with heavy handed self indulgence it remains another one of his coloring book fantasies with dirty words and buckets of blood. The only difference is his cartoon characters have changed costumes and time traveled to other lands. Everything else is the same. It is another one of his big budget B movies.",4,5,11,27 August 2013
Get Out," Guess Who's Coming to Dinner 2000
","Sidney Poitier would have had his work cut out for him confronting the band of 'enlightened' upscale Caucasoid suburbanites found in Get Out, a well paced dark comic horror film by Jordan Peele. Expecting a skeptical Tracy and Hepburn the hero goes from Sid to Duane Jones, Ben in Night of the Living Dead instead.Promising photographer Chris and Kathy are off for a weekend to meet the parents in upstate NY. Chris a little edgy over the fact the parents are unaware of his racial make-up has these fears extinguished momentarily in their initial meeting as they attempt to make him at ease with cringing patronizing. Chris soon begins to see some strange behavior in the help and when he allows Kath's mom, a shrink to put him under hypnosis for his smoking habit the wheels really start to come off.Auteur Peel maintains a decent balance of shock and laughter throughout Out with judicious editing and a touch of Bernhard Hermann score as protagonist Chris begins to get the feeling he's in this situation on his own. Things do become farcical eventually but not before Peele exhausts the subtle creepy undertone that energizes the film.Dan Kayuuya's Chris as the much put upon hero takes it up a notch for a horror film conveying some intense desperation against a family out to get him. Allison Williams as his duplicitous girlfriend is chilling in more than one scene while Betty Gabriel as housekeeper Georgina offers up a few with a startling presence. Get Out is an entertaining and well crafted horror for first timer Peele that certainly merits attention his next time out.",7,13,24,13 December 2017
Drive," Boring Drive fails to maintain decent speed.
","This sluggish piece of neo noir featuring a protagonist (Ryan Gosling) in a constant state of comatose cool who assists in LA heists will have you wanting to get out after a couple of miles as it cruises into the slow lane of mawkish pretentiousness after the first twenty minutes. Other than a couple of taut car chases this lemon has to depend on some vivid gratuitous violence to keep the audience awake as it careens out of control.Gosling is Driver (what else?) who beyond giving instructions is a mostly mute dour fellow who looks in need of a good sleep. He don't carry artillery he just drives. Don't get him mad though.The story is needlessly convoluted with Driver becoming involved with the girl and her kid next door whose paroled husband is forced into pulling off a job involving mob money of the same shadowy characters that bankroll a race car (did I tell you he has sure thing Nascar driver promise? ) as well as his loyal buddy who employs him who wouldn't you know it is also involved in the heist that's really a scam to cheat the East Coast mob.Director Nicholas Winding Redfn opens Drive with a sharply edited tense nighttime LA heist raising the tempo to a high pitch almost immediately. But by the time the opening credits finish Redfn begins to stumble with awkward clumsily paced scenes filled with pregnant pauses and pallid posing in the dark by all concerned. Redfn moves his camera without purpose and when he does frame a composition well he lets it linger to a point of tedium. Making matters even more heavy handed are a soundtrack and music score (Cliff Martinez gets the blame) barging its way through nearly every scene of insipid gravity reinforcing ad nausea its tough guy stance to a point of unintentional parody. Performances are uniformly zombie led by Gosling, a clueless Carey Mulligan as the drab, conflicted love interest and Albert Brooks with his usual flat lifeless affect as a surly hood looking heavily medicated. Bryan Cranston as Driver's boss delivers somewhat but the script will only let him expand on his role to a limited degree lacking the depth to make him or anyone else for that matter absorbing or even mildly interesting. Drive is one long meandering ride of strained seriousness. Better you should walk.",5,6,11,29 September 2011
The Lives of Others," Powerful reminder of not too distant past.
","There seems to have been no shortage of totalitarian Philistines in East Germany after World War Two's housecleaning of the Nazi Party. Soviet Communism had a vast network of secret police and informers to practice their 1984 Big Brother tactics on it's fellow citizens with incredible fervor (Stasi agents) and fear (informers).In a stunningly subdued portrait of totalitarian repression The Lives of Others presents us with the reality of the Orwell experiment that was East Germany. Grounded in reality it does not have the option to utilize the future as seen through the imaginative eye of a fantasy, sci-fi storey line complete with dazzling pyrotechnics (Brazil, Blade Runner) depicting a 1984 future. Others is more terrifying than that since it took place in the lifetime of most adults living today.It is indeed 1984 and the Stasi (secret police) still have a firm grip on the long suffering people of East Germany. Repression and censorship is the rule of the day and no dissent is brooked, period. Artists are naturally stifled, yet some manage to get their work staged by playing along with the Party. Playwright, Georg Dreyman is a State fave, but chafes at the treatment of other artists black listed for being more forthcoming. A Beria like culture minister with designs on Dreyman's beautiful actress girlfriend initiates a file on him. Agent Wiesler (brilliantly portrayed by Ulrich Muhe) , a committed and ultra thorough investigator takes up the task. Dreyman believing he is above suspicion writes an anonymous piece for de Spiegel exposing the East and Wiesler has the goods on him. Wiesler's intense observation of Dreyman and co-horts though has exposed him perhaps for the first time in his life to the beauty of art, the preciousness of relationships and the freedom to think as an individual. Could the brainwashed career man be weakening?Director/writer Florian Herbel von Dommenmarck has made a powerful and important film with Other Peoples Lives. It is a sober, grim telling of what a society is capable of in the firm grip of a police state and the petty venal bureaucrats running it. His overall visual palette ideally captures the drab colorless GDR setting inhabited by anxious citizens and polluting Trabants. It is a joyless world of deep suspicion where neighbors, friends, co-workers, teammates (even Olympic gold medalist Katarina Witt was an informer) are turned against each other. It is society at it's most abysmal. I would make it required viewing for all freedom loving people were it not totalitarian of me to do so.",9,0,0,26 July 2008
Grudge Match," Two warhorses beating a dead one.
","What a perverse piece of garbage this nostalgic money grab is as two ancient entertainers dust off their pugilistic skills to be wheeled into the ring for the last time while a loyal audience from yesteryear slides into denial in the dark. Are John Travolta and Olivia Newton John waiting in the wings to reprise? Former ring foes with no love lost for each other but strapped for cash get convinced by fast talking promoter Dante Slate (Kevin Hart)to simulate for an X-Box game. Time has not softened their stance towards each other and the two looking like Kermit the Frog decorated for Christmas club it out. The video goes viral and the interest sparks the long awaited third and final slug fest between Rocky Balboa and Jake LaMotta assuming the stage names of 'Razor' Sharp (Sly Stallone) and Billy the Kid McDonnen (Bobby DeNiro). More suited to play The Sunshine Boys than their ghosts of the past, Stallone and DeNiro trade barbs better than punches with the same streetwise, schoolyard bravado we baby boomers grew up on but it becomes stale, tiresome and downright embarrassing as these two multi millionaires with reputations intact scrounge for more with this wasted exercise. It is left up to Hart as the fast talking Slate to raise the level of energy while Alan Arkin, clearly having a better late career than either of these two washed up thespian pugs shares acting honors with Hart. From the outset of Grudge Match it is clear that these two warhorses are more suited for the glue factory than the ring.",5,7,24,26 December 2013
1917," No Man's Land Nightmare
","A British regiment is walking into a trap and the only way to reach them is by messenger. It's a long shot and the troopers know it so the commander has wisely chosen Corporal Blake, the brother of a member of the regiment to provide them with incentive to move with haste. His war weary mate's feelings remain mixed.Fix your bayonet and join Corporals Blake and Scofield in a race with death across No Man's Land, April 1917. Without an ounce of let-up 1917 is a film experience like no other with director Sam Mendes seemingly only having to yell action once. Relentlessly paced it gives the audience like our protagonists little time to pause or relax as Mendes infuses every moment with tension, every movement one of unpredictable suspenseful outcome.Dean Charles Chapman and George Mckay as the corporals give powerful performances as they make their way through this macabre obstacle course of death, decay and destrutction. Chafing with resentment at times, they nevertheless have each others backs and commit to the mission.Pantheon cinematographer Roger Deakins simply delivers one rousing image and bravura camera move after the next that plainly states why he is. He along with Mendes and company (editor Lee Smith, production designer Dennis Gassner) have not only made the best film of the year but the best since its ground breaking predecessor Birdman (2014). Falling out of its high velocity synch only once ( a scene with a refugee and child) 1917 is masterful film making that will awe on many levels.",9,0,2,15 January 2020
Lincoln," Day Lewis carries lumbering Lincoln
","As he did in There will be Blood the art of Daniel Day Lewis simply overwhelms intriguing plot, solid production values and the lumbering direction of Steven Spielberg in Lincoln. Summoning his inner Henry Fonda Lewis once again proves with authority that he is the finest English speaking actor working in film.Lincoln concentrates on the final year of the war and the political struggle to end slavery in the Senate. Now just as then politics can be very surly and Spielberg does not spare Honest Abe when considering the stakes and he consents to whatever means possible.Spielberg's direction is deliberate and stodgy with beautifully lit compositions that hang around too long. He also stumbles with his jarring attempt to bring a comic relief to the sober theme regarding a trio of shifty con men displaying too much stooge slapstick working in concert with Lincoln's cabinet.Sally Field's Mrs.Lincoln does not hold its own with Lewis because no one's performance this year and most others don't but she does supply a fair share of powerful moments. Spielberg gets competent performances from the rest of his cast save Spader's manic hipster con man but with all the performances as well as director Spielberg's meandering pace you will hardly notice since Daniel Day Lewis has your complete attention from start to finish.",7,0,5,10 January 2013
Caddyshack," Caddy Shack nearly breaks par.
","After writing the enormously popular Animal House director John Ramis sat in the director's chair for the first time and wisely allowed Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield to do their own thing in this uneven comedy about Country Club swells and employees. There's plenty of funny in Caddy Shack but plenty of bogey making as well.The members of the club led by Ted Knight's pompous Judge Smails are predictable clichÃ©s while the frat house has been moved to the links to accommodate the animal class of 1980. Wading into a morass of diversionary minor plots and idol chatter Bill and Rodney tear the place up with their genuine brand of irreverence. Groundskeeper Murray acting and looking like he's taken a fair share of nine irons to the head delivers more than half of the films funniest moments particularly while destroying flower beds with a driver and delivering play by play. Dangerfield gathers up most of the remaining laughs by showing no respect for the snobbish members. Chevy Chase as the club pro is a smarmy waste and the rest of the cast verbose extras. Caddy Shack is clearly a two man show, everything else ends up in the sand trap.",6,1,3,11 May 2011
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Crayola Havoc
","Uma Thurman is Clint Eastwood in drag in this blood drenched comic book of a movie about revenge that is as stale as the the 30 year old low budget chop socky garbage it emulates.On her wedding day the pregnant Bride (Thurman) has her reception ruined when her old employer Bill (CEO of an assassination bureau) has his squad of flunkies shoot up the festivities. All present are killed with the exception of The Bride who remains in a coma for a few years. When sleeping beauty eventually arises all hell breaks loose. Determined to exact revenge on former co-workers in warrior fashion she embarks on a bloody path from the States to Japan.Movie boy wonder of the last decade, Quentin Tarantino, is a prime example of how far American Cinema has fallen since its late seventies collapse. Critics have sung his praises far and wide as a new voice with a fresh approach. Having achieved iconic pop culture and auteur status Kill's full title is Quentin Tarantino's 4th Film Kill Bill 1. Welles and Ford never got that type of billing and Hitchcock didn't earn it until his fiftieth film. Not QT, he's a phenom. I however must respectfully disagree.Bill is very colorful and surreal most of the time which dilutes its effect, kills the realism and turns the characters into solemn cartoon characters. Tarantino's dialogue is his typical profanity laced paragraphs that nuanced slightly could be interchanged with all his other profanity laced scripts of threat and bravado. His visuals go from tedious posing to nostalgic kung fu chaos seasoned in buckets of blood. They have the sophistication of a disturbed 9 year old who has troubles staying within the lines of his coloring book. In addition to Thurman's Eastwood sex change he evokes the style and pacing of the lumbering work of Sergio Leone from start to finish. As a comic book Kill Bill 1 would be a page turner. The only thing it turns as a film in the adolescent hands of Tarantino is one's stomach.",2,5,9,26 March 2008
The Hangover Part II," Sorry sequel.
","This dead drunk follow-up to the oft hilarious original is a shameless cash grab. Other than a change in locale the 'wolf pack' like the audience, falls for the same stunts as in the first except we're prepared making the material stale and our modern day stooges repetitive bores. Oh, there's a cigarette smoking monkey, a transsexual encounter and Mike Tyson along to sing poorly but what it depends on most, the shock value for laughs is reheated leftovers from the original. Stu is getting married in Thailand and hopes to avoid the Vegas debacle of two years earlier. Pressured into inviting the socially inept Alan (Zach Galifinakis) along disasters await in the wings. It's bad enough the father of the bride dislikes Stu to begin with but wait til obnoxious Alan adds his two cents. With big box office assured in the title alone Hangover 2 is inferior every way. Director Todd Phillips takes few chances using the same convoluted recipe of hallucination and black out from the first but with the audience prepared for it most of the humor lands with a heavy thud.Zach Galinafikis was clearly the centerpiece and biggest contributer to the success of the first film but here he's lost the edge and freshness and his five minutes ( most get fifteen ) seem to be over. As Stu and Phil Bradley Cooper and Stan Helms merely recite what they did in the first. Only Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow lives up to the originals audacity and energy but with the rest of the cast looking winded and ineffective Hangover 2 remains too sober for its own good.",4,2,4,11 June 2011
The Dark Knight," Badman
","One has to sit through a lot of idiocy in this sado masochistic wet dream in order to glean some exciting moments as this loud bombastic endless piece of highly polished garbage bashes it's way to a sequel. Given the running time there are plenty of thrills and chills that more or less simply repeat themselves for the last hour by which time it becomes a race between losing interest or your hearing.Gotham City is in danger of being picked clean by the mob. Only crusading DA Harvey Dent and Inspector Gordon stand between them. Enter the Joker, a sadistic yukster who can't get or deliver enough mayhem to all concerned. Even Batman has his hands full with the cruel overly optimistic and principled (it ain't about the money) bad Bozo. Now the stage is set to destruct much of the city, kill and injure much of the populace and give the Joker every opportunity to escape.Batman has always walked a fine line between fantasy and gritty realism (sci fi meets noir) that I felt succeeded when the tone was light. But this follow-up to Batman Begins allows even more darkness to seep in. The caped crusader is even more conflicted this time around since he's still sweet on his ex, now the DA's girlfriend. Then there is the impervious Joker. Still the energizer bunny to punishment he bounces back like a Joe Palooka doll no matter how bad the beating. After all if you kill him, you maim the sequel. The mirthful maniac, so crucial to keeping the train running is simply replaced by another less resilient villain.As Bruce Wayne, Christian Bale displays an ambiguous menace. As Batman he exchanges boiler plate philosophies (sprinkled with Bush administration policy) with cops and crooks sounding as if he has severe emphysema. It's hard to say if it's Heath Ledger or the make-up that makes him so ominous. Certainly the most sadistic Joker to date he lack's Nicholson's breezy take and better cosmetics as well as TV Joker Caesar Romero's boundless comic energy. But even with an Uncle Fester intonation he is a disturbing and convincing example of the fearless nihilist.Director Chris Nolan pours the chaos and carnage on like syrup with sensorial disregard. There's a well edited bank heist at the beginning of the film and Batman gets to tool around Gotham in a really cool motorcycle (Bat cycle?) but the biggest budget on earth (this may well have been) cannot disguise the fact it it is an inferior work to his gripping and imaginative Memento. Like another Indy phenom Steven Soderbergh he has chosen to sell out (Who can blame him, who wouldn't want a piece of the film gross?) to make bloated shiny movies that make a lot of noise and cash. The Hollywood moguls gain is the art house loss with this one time original filmmaker.The evolvement of Batman from the unique comic book crime fighter to the satirically brilliant TV show to the mega monster super film franchise has gone through many transformations to date. From the record breaking box office returns most would agree that it's for the better. Call me sentimental but it will never improve over the comic I would read twice while sitting under the maple tree in my yard and then trade even up with my friends for a Flash or a Green Lantern. Loud as this slick and crass masterpiece of marketing is it will never deliver the bang for the buck that the pages of the comic fed my imagination without all the noise.",5,8,15,7 August 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Magnificent self indulgence
","Stanley Kubrick's slow go science fiction piece demands patience from its audience as he bombards it with endless visual and audio extravagance at a sometimes snail pace that challenges one's concentration and endurance. It is a film experience to be survived with an outcome that will either dazzle you or bore you to tears.Something or someone is dropping large domino shaped monoliths about the galaxy. They seem to exude a superior intelligence bent on spreading the wealth where it takes on Earth enabling evolving mankind to kill and conquer through weaponry. When another monolith is discovered far into the future on the moon, Earth sends an expeditionary team comprised of five humans and one sharp self confident computer, Hal 9000 to inspect and follow the trail to Jupiter to get the lowdown. Dissension breaks out on the ship however and the mission is jeopardized.2001 is a visually stunning experience to behold on the big screen. It asks a lot of its audience and caught in the right frame of mind a cinematic experience of the first order. Ultimately it comes down to whether your mood is in alignment with Kubrick's tedious at times self indulgent floating rhythm. For nearly the first half hour there is no dialog for the remarkable opening transition from the dawn of man to present day space travel. Accompanied by a spot on music score (Strauss, Khachakurian) you are carried through space in a graceful and awe inspiring fashion both inside and outside the ship. The suspense ramps up when Hal goes rogue but even at this juncture Kubrick maintains his deliberate turgid pace that for some may ask too much. The visual fireworks really explode in the final segment partnered with an auditory assault that is to be endured rather than passively enjoyed as the last surviving astronaut roars toward Jupiter.2001 is a milestone in sci fi cinema; the halfway point between Melies Trip to the Moon from the 19th century and the ease at which advanced technology in this day and age can achieve creating similar terrain. Kubrick's use of sound and score to accompany his odd angled flowing visuals is indeed as mind blowing an experience one might have in 20th century film but his pace is painstakingly slow at times and you may find yourself wanting to abandon ship. Since it's opening decades back I have made half a dozen attempts to stay the course with this beast of a movie and finished it three times, twice with disappointment results. The one other time I completed it I walked out truly blown away. It is the one that remains with me and it is a very rewarding experience informing perhaps that the fault is in ourselves not the star, Stanley Kubrick.",9,5,13,8 June 2014
Midsommar," Millenial moron misadventure.
","This stunningly immature work of horror under blue skies about a well scrubbed overly benign cult into ritual gore bordering on the operatic opens with an intriguing table setter, a labor intensive slaughter of parents, before it goes full tilt silly at a remote Swedish village where members frolic in white with woodwinds and wander lust.Christian wants out with Dani ( Florence Pugh ) but sticks by her after the traumatic loss of her parents. She can be a real drag and further dampens matters when she goes along with the guys to do some tripping with a cult comprised of all ages and smiles. On the surface it looks like a Utopian society but then the ambiguous by-laws begin to kick in and things get gruesome.It becomes apparent upon arrival at the village that Midsommar is a group Wicker Man in the making, it's supposed well educated protagonists clueless as 12 year olds. Moving at a snails pace writer director Ari Aster's festival ground setting has a very artificial wide open emptiness that he accents with strategic groupings of posing cliches. Pugh's simpering Dani leads a cast of supposed adults acting like kids and all slow on the draw through this debacle as she mopes from end to end gets buried under flowers along with being crowned with an Easter basket while witnessing more horrors but with a new outlook. Aster's heavy handed, poorly edited money scenes are sluggish and unintentionally comic at times but one will find little to chuckle about after being duped into tolerating this obscenely lengthy gore bore.",2,3,10,14 February 2020
Alice in Wonderland," Pimping Alice
","Dark side director Tim Burton with screen alter ego Johnny Depp in tow would seem a safe logical and predictable choice to direct the surreal Alice in Wonderland in 3D and for his fans I'm sure he doesn't disappoint. But even though tweaked for today's audience with an age of consent anorexic Alice faced with a pre rabbit hole crisis there is a clear lack of creativity that makes this Alice a tedious waste of time. Burton with all the technical bells and whistles at his disposal employs his usual characteristic quirks while Depp dresses up in his latest Halloween costume making for a joyless and disturbing Alice bereft of charm and lightness of intent. As a shabby underworld Wonka Depp's Mad Hatter is a waste of time as is Anne Hathaway's White Queen. They are two big names who contribute nothing besides luring one to the theatre. The technical advances bring improvement to the rabbits the caterpillar and Ts Dumb and Dee but the Cheshire Cat is a disappointment literally lacking the 51 Disney's hallucinogenic color. Only Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen seems to capture the spirit of the original character.Since the turn of the last century there have been at least two dozen renderings on film of the classic children's story Alice in Wonderland. Like all children's stories it has amazing resilience in that its large core audience re-generates on a yearly basis by having it imposed on them by parents who underwent the same process. By the time this audience gets around to Cervantes and Dosteyevsky the numbers drop precipitously. Karamozov is a gamble but Alice is a safe box office bet. Time dictates updated makeovers however and like Betty Crocker and Aunt Jemima Alice has gone through a variety of changes not specifically intended for children. There have been adult, modern day, animated, musical and even x-rated versions. This take is little more than a tarted up and edgy Alice that is too dark for children and too childish for adults. This may add up to big box office drawing off both demographics but as a film it's an uneven travesty.",5,4,9,18 May 2010
The Artist," Retro Rubbish
","Somewhere in this unreasonable facsimile of and on silent filmmaking a clip of Doug Fairbanks as Zorro appears for under 30 seconds. For the the rest of the film I lamented the fact I wasn't watching it instead of this pale imitation of an homage to a mix and match variety of silent fact and folklore. This corny clunker proves beyond doubt there ain't nothing like the real thing.George Valintin is one of silent films great leading men (Fairbanks) that mocks the advent of sound before soon coming victim (Novarro, Gilbert) to it. As his star falls ( Norman Maine) a dancer (Vickie Lester) he once befriended and met in comical fashion riding a shooting one takes him in. His pride gets the best of him however and he begins to self destruct. Throughout it all his noble dog sticks to his side. The Artist is to be commended for its attempt to give later generations a look at what it was like to see silents the way they were meant to be. But after two visually impressive opening scenes the compositions become mundane, the montage slow the prosaic storyline banal scraps of classics including sound work from Welles, Lean, Chaplin and Berkeley. When the film itself stubbornly hangs on to its' silent stance even after the advent of sound it literally stalls and stunts itself, and the idea becomes self defeating. I'll do the cast a favor and mention no one beyond a charming Jean Dujardin for no one merits it save the adorable dog who doesn't need much to steal scenes from these ensemble dullard humans who offer little more than waxen posturing. They broadly parody the 'ancient' style of film acting but lack the faces and the nuance of the originals. Director Michel Havavicius simply turns off the sound shoots his film in black and white and shoots a cliché ridden Singin' in the Rain / A Star is Born hybrid and from the looks of it wondered if he'd researched any silents at all.For the uninitiated to the silent era and the masterpieces from it The Artist might be an exotic sea change from the impersonal computer generated 3 D world of cinema today but if one truly wants to see it done in all its antiquated magnificence then seek out theatre screenings of Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Gish, Lon Chaney, Vidor and Griffith. The Artist is simply a slick repro with nothing under the hood.",5,5,15,15 February 2012
La La Land," La La starts fast, crawls at finish.
","With its gangbusters intro, appropriately taking place in an LA traffic jam, La La Land looks like it is about to serve notice on the American film musical with an exuberant energy informing the audience it is in for a fun ride. The energy level however begins to waver when the dependence switches from music and dancing to melodrama and the film, divided into seasons (like LA has them) begins to stumble just before Autumn. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) first meet in less than amicable fashion on the everyday bumper to bumper existence of the LA freeway. Actress Mia works as a barista on a film lot and spends time off going to casting calls that end in disappointment. Sebastian is a quirky, purist, jazz pianist and his own worst enemy when it comes to being employed. The two cross paths again, hook-up and continue their artistic struggle for recognition. When success knocks on both doors it threatens the future of the relationship. La La Land offers up a handful of well done musical numbers, imaginative dance scenes as well as a some early comic friction between the leads but the story line remains banal. Director Damien Chazelle attempts to circumvent this by adding some 'what if' moments to the story to give it more life but it only packs on more minutes to this already overlong musical.As bargain basement Fred and Ginger the duo offer less than fancy footwork along with pedestrian singing voices but that is part of their charm. Stone at least looks like she is enjoying herself while digging deep enough dramatically to hold some of the films more torpid dramatic scenes together. Gosling is simply a lightweight whose abrasive character offers little to like to begin with and his singing and dancing along with a series of faraway stares grows tiresome by the second half and what started out with the promising chops of another Cabaret eventually degenerates into the mawkish graceless excess of New York, New York.",6,8,14,6 January 2017
Limitless," Limitless reaches its halfway through.
","Turn on, tune in, conquer the world seems to be the mantra in this Leary fairy tale about a guy with writer's block that gets his hands on the ultimate hallucinogenic that will open every door that Huxley puts in front of you. The film itself mimics a drug experiences with an early rush of intense energy and giddiness followed by fatigue and the drag of coming down and it turns out to be more pink elephant than white rabbit.Eddie Morra is on the skids. He can't get past the first page of his book and his girlfriend and meal ticket has just walked out on him. He runs into a shady of character former brother in law on the street who turns him on to a super brain steroid. The initial results are more than promising as he writes 40 pages of his book and screws his landlady. Clearly he has to have more of this stuff. He locates the ex- brother in law but more importantly inherits his stash. Eddie is soon wheeling and dealing ten to twenty steps ahead of his competitors and a hot property to land in the world of big business. He is dogged however by some pretty tough cookies who want in on the miracle drug.Narrated in the first person of the protagonist Eddie (Bradley Cooper) at first is a benign though self destructive Lubowski type who morphs into a smug Wall St. wizard creep before circumstance overtakes him and blood begins to flow and the film's minimal credulity flies out the window. Cooper does a fine job of carrying the film convincingly moving from Jekyl to Hyde as he trips his brain fantastic but director Burger is intent on making him an unrepentant super hero and the sublime early visuals soon become absurd posturing on a parallel planet, Eddie's World, which like this film is as barren as the moon.",5,1,3,22 March 2011
Some Like It Hot," Wilder's Broad Comedy is Hilarious.
","I more strongly prefer the masterly noir work of Billy Wilder, (I find his comedies forced with equal amounts of hit or miss humor) but Some Like It Hot is one comedy that excels on many levels. The script crackles with wit, there's plenty of slapstick and about half a dozen classic film moments.Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are out of work musicians whose luck takes another downward turn when they witness the St. Valentines Massacre. They take it on the lamb, adopting female identities and hook up with an all women band who has a sweet gig in Miami. The plan is to just get out of Chicago and away from the mob. Miami however does not prove to be a safe haven.Lemmon and Curtis are a perfect comedy team in Hot, superior to any of Lemmon's many teamings with Matthau. Lemmon's tendency to over act is evident in the early moments but once in drag it becomes pitch perfect. Curtis has never been funnier whether he's vamping it or doing his atrocious Cary Grant and the two acting styles work well as they comically frustrate each other from start to finish. Marilyn Monroe never was much of an actress but here she exudes the ultimate dumb blonde stereotype that creates the legend.There's a certain burlesque and stereotype to Wilder's work certainly evidenced in the buxom presence of Monroe and broad portrayals of Italian gangsters ( George Raft)Irish cops (Pat O'Brien) along with Keystone Cop chases that come across a little fatigued. O'Brien is hardly on screen and Raft had long ceased to ever be capable of acting and was no longer menacing. Joe E. Brown as an aging playboy more than makes up for the rest of the lackluster supporting cast courting Lemmon with hilarious nonchalance and along with the two male leads delivers Wilder and I.A. Diamonds snappy dialog with maximum comic effect.",8,1,1,22 February 2008
The Departed," The Good Fellas in Boston - Episode 4
","It's more from the boy who gave you Good fellas, Casino (Good Fellas goes to Vegas) The Gangs of New York (The Good Fellas go Back in Time) with his latest of the series, The Departed (Good Fellas in Boston). Yes it's more illegal mayhem featuring ruthless mob bosses, cold blooded killers, well edited acts of violence and murder serenaded with nostalgic pop music.All of these films are variations in one form or another from Martin Scorsese's highly original and brilliant first color film Mean Streets. By the end of the 80's he was probably America's finest active director with a resume that included two classics, Taxi Driver and the remarkable Raging Bull. Good Fellas was a well made update of Mean Streets. A kind of Mean Streets grows-up with a bigger budget and glossier look. Still it lacked the grittiness and energy of Streets. Casino had Pesci and Di Nero taking the same act to Vegas. It was back to New York and a century earlier with Gangs. This time it was Daniel Day Lewis and Leonard DiCaprio doing Bobby and Joe. Now we have The Departed with a hammy Jack Nicholson and Leonard DiCaprio doing a full court Brando in this tale about police corruption and the Irish Mafia in Boston. The same Scorcese themes and devices (corruption and betrayal, vulgarity and violence) are nuanced to fit the Boston Irish stereotype. Bad accents abound with Martin Sheen's inebriated Ted Kennedy taking the honor as best of the worst. The rest of the actors displaying 'Irish tempers' are uniformly bad. They rank with Day-Lewis unintentionally comic performance in Gangs.So if you like the series (the Oscar crowd certainly did) you'll get more of the same in The Departed. Marty won't disappoint. He's a celebrity icon now but I liked him much better when he was an artist.",5,1,2,11 November 2007
Zero Dark Thirty," Maya gets her man.
","The decade long hunt for Osama Bin Laden takes nearly as long to tell in this laboriously slow telling interspersed with explosions to keep the audience awake in Zero Dark Thirty. Director Ann Bigelow does an end run with the story as she tells it from the point of view of a high school recruited CIA agent who goes from innocent to intrepid man hunter over the period while the rest of a timid CIA runs in circles before she sets Director Leon Panetta straight and leads the team to his hideout. Given Maya's ubiquitous and sure handed presence throughout the film one is surprised at the films climax that she doesn't fly one of the copters and lead the commandos in the raid not to mention putting the bullets in UBL.Bigelow does not shy away from the controversial use of torture in getting info as the film opens with Maya's baptism of fire. She is at first repulsed and nauseated but over time allows it in her. interrogations. Following a series of leads, many going nowhere they eventually get lucky with the possibility they have located him in a house in Pakistan. The decision to move on the info is met with skepticism and doubt by the suits but Maya pushed to the back steps up and gives the it's spine. Leon likes her ( she does have that stoic spunk )and it's go time on her callAs Maya aka Joan of Arc, Jessica Chastein performance is a series of reaction shots and outbursts as Bigelow frames her in taut close up and Gary Cooper High Noon long shots. The film is all business and personal lives factor little. Maya alienated from the bungling around her connects little with the rest of the agents save for a giddy exchange of texting between girls bringing an enemy in that ends disastrously. Other than a torturer CIA agents are doughy and sheepish, the commandos Tony Robbins fans and good horseshoe players.With little or no depth of character to be found the film relies on it's suspenseful moments for it's voice but they are too far and few between to keep the film above the torpor it constantly lapses into and the result is a disappointing telling of the story of the century that more aptly might be titled Alice in Nightmare Land.",5,3,10,21 January 2013
Crazy Heart," Bridges lifts paper thin plot.
",Hard living Bad Blake is well on the downside of his career as he plays one night stands in small clubs and bowling alleys around the Southwest. Demon alcohol has taken its toll on the once gifted singer songwriter as he stumbles from show to show working with pick up bands and leaving mid song to vomit backstage before returning to finish.This country western version of The Wrestler has little to go on save for the touching performance of Jeff Bridges as Blake. Bridges has always had an unpretentious amiability that registers with audiences and as Bad he brings it to another level displaying a solid country voice to go along with his scruffy persona. But Bridges heavyweight performance cannot sustain the lightweight script.Director Scott Cooper shoots most of Heart in close-up and while it is effective in conveying Blakes state it becomes all too revealing in displaying the limited abilities of Maggie Gylenhaal as the love interest. Displaying the same vapid style and delivery that made Diane Keaton a star she is both miscast and unconvincing as Cooper bores in on her button blue eyes for power and introspection but instead magnifies her vacuity and how far out of her depth she is opposite Bridges. Robert Duvall and Colin Farrell also chip in with uninspired performances as Cooper does little to build on their relationship (particularly Farrell) with Blake. He's content to have them toss around cliché ridden dialog without getting too deep beneath the surface with his paint by the numbers storyline.It's a shame Crazy Heart plays it safe with Blake's difficult but always likable character. It might have soared if Bad was a bit more cantankerous and surly. It would have given the film a much needed shot of adrenalin and made for a more taut and powerful drama that for the most part limps along like a dreary country tune on your car radio two hundred miles from home.,6,2,6,21 February 2010
There Will Be Blood," Day-Lewis is Outstanding in well made Tale of Greed
","Without a word spoken over the film's first fifteen minutes director PT Anderson succinctly defines the persona of rugged individualist Daniel Plainview in this epic tale about greed and oil in There Will Be Blood. In excruciating detail we watch prospector Plainview toil under dangerous conditions as he burrows alone into the dark earth endure debilitating injury and literally crawl to the assayer's office to make his claim. Plainview is clearly a man to be reckoned with and over the next two hours we are witness to his rise and fall as he seduces, bribes, murders, gets saved and cajoles his way to vast wealth in the early years of the twentieth century.In Blood director Anderson deviates from his previous works such as Boogie Nights, a dull soap opera on the porno film industry and Magnolia, a promising Altmanesque quilt with a spectacularly inane climax, by avoiding the multiple speaking roles that tend to deaden and distract from character development. In Blood he focuses on Plainview alone and we are rewarded with one of cinema's most powerful and fully formed character portrayals of this young century. Daniel Day-Lewis lives and breathes the role of Plainview that remains riveting from start to finish. Minus the Brooklyn accent and scenery chewing that plagued him in Gang's of New York he displays every bit the threat and ruthlessness but in a more chilling and stoic fashion. Anderson daringly and successfully keeps Plainview in nearly every scene revealing his lust for money and his methodology. At the same time he allows the audience to ponder the ambiguous side of Plainview (misogyny, feelings toward religion)on their own. Anderson also does a deft balancing act in maintaining Plainview's relationship with H.W., his adopted son. Claiming him as his own son (he states the mother died in child birth) there are scenes of genuine fatherly love, but oil, wealth and power still remain Plainview's greatest passion and as the film progresses one questions his use for the boy in his grand plan.Robert Elswit's photography has a superb texture that presents us with a dry and dusty harsh California landscape filled with bleakness and challenge in which only the strong and driven can survive. He also daringly under lights scenes to convey the darkness of Plainview's character and world. John Greenwood's music score is uneven but effective most of the time and the sound recording is top notch.My only minor complaint about Blood is the miscasting of Paul Dano in the role of Eli Sunday, Plainview's religious fanatic opponent. Every bit as greedy as Plainview, Dano's Sunday lacks the strength of character and maturity needed to oppose Plainview. His fire and brimstone tirades seem out of place and out of time, very much resembling the contemporary style of Tom Cruises' Magnolia preacher. This aside, There Will Be Blood is a very rewarding piece of cinema, imaginatively directed, patiently told and masterfully acted by Lewis.",8,0,4,27 January 2008
Burlesque," The grotesque state of the film musical
","The state of American film in the 21st Century has been generally abysmal but nowhere is it more evident than in the film musical. Taking the most honored of the period Chicago, a Fosse wanta be with bad performances and forgettable tunes as the benchmark it is more than evident all singing all dancing has lost its voice and more than a step. The latest entry and every bit the tepid much ado about nothing heat and light display of flaccid musical storytelling as the Oscar winner (an even bigger comment on the unimaginative state of the movie business) is the insipidly slick Burlesque.Stop me if you've heard this. Young impressionable girl with massive hidden talent leaves the land of corn for the bright lights of LA where she stumbles upon a run down anachronism with a crusty but understanding owner still in it for love of the game who gives the kid a break and, well you can fill in the rest.In the role of Judy Garland Christine Aguleria sings the blues with impressive voice but it's all plastic soul and slumming for the former mouseketeer who presents an unintentionally jarring visual context of an Aryan uber babe singing Bessie Smith. Speaking of plastic Cher all polished and waxed like an antique Oldsmobile splits her time offering sage advice and sarcasm. In addition she does a couple of tunes with her signature howl wrapped as always in distracting outfit and opulent stagecraft to soften its blow. There's some male characters whose purpose it seems is to stand around with expressions of awe for the divas and of course the serious pyrotechnics surrounding the noir dance numbers that attempts to put some make-up on this pig but in the end it is all forced Fosse.",3,87,168,1 December 2010
Joker," Send in the gore, Bickle goes operatic.
","You have to be patient with Todd Phillip's Joker before he delivers the requisite gore fest this god of sadistic comedy requires. It is carried along most of the way by the outstanding performance of Joaquin Phoenix and a lax system and gullible society unable to put the obvious together that allows the morose Arthur Fleck to wreak havoc in plain sight.Nothing could live up to the film's hype and outside of Phoenix's stirring but admittedly overlong performance ( a little too many yoga poses) the film depends heavily on nostalgia (music, era, Scosese) to propel its meagre satiric moments. As far as the character, Peck is classic cliche loner, Travis Bickle as Paglacci hanging around his old haunts.Like all hateful Jokers, Arthur is imbued with the ability to take an incredible beating as he does here before rising from the ashes in Todd's apocalyptic uptown climax that is more nonsensical than parable.Featuring a performance for the ages Joker ultimately is a smug gratuitously violent slasher, its unintentionally comic moments watching the heavy handed Phillips maintain PC order amid all the chaos.",4,9,23,9 October 2019
A Hard Day's Night," The Beatles as Marxists
","The idea of putting pop stars and their band in movies goes back to Rudy Valle and his Connecticut Yankees in early sound. With a fan base and popularity already established a large audience capture would be inevitable even if the story line was tepid. As long as you injected a half a dozen songs or more into the plot it was a recipe for success. Vallee didn't take off but Bing and Elvis did and while Crosby had better scripts the lame Elvis vehicles killed at the box office.The Beatles phenomena was only a couple of years old when they released Hard Day's Night in 1964 and it predictably did excellent box office. What wasn't predictable was with the ease the Fab Four, albeit playing themselves, were at Marxian comedy. Under the stylishly hip (part mod, part nouvelle vague) direction of American ex-Pat Richard Lester, Night has an infectious energy that is bouyed by the comfortable impish charm of the quartet. Lester wisely avoids joining the boys at the hip allowing each his own space away from the other much of the film and they all comport themselves (especially Ringo) surprisingly well; though truth be told Wilfrid Bramble as Paul's rebellious grandfather steals every scene he is in. There's an album's worth of great tunes (still selling millions 45 years later) that make the film an even better listen but the band's brand of dead pan and anarchic humor (Marx Brothers light) is more than enough to sustain this very amusing little film on its own.",7,1,2,26 November 2010
The Wolf of Wall Street," Tortuously excessive take on excess
","Did Marty Scorcese fall asleep in front of his movieola or lose his place editing the last two thirds of this film involving vapid characters in wild pursuit of cash with no depth to flesh out other than a team spirit equal in locker room adrenalin to halftime at Ohio State. After a couple of overlong Rocknesque team motivating speeches channeling Andrew Dice Clay along the way Lenny and Wolf of Wall St. hits a dead end with nowhere to go but from one drug fueled, sex crazed Bachannalian bash to the next while staying a step or two ahead of the feds.Wolf starts fast with altruistic but ambitious Jason Belfort's ( Leonard DiCaprio) rise, stumble and meteoric burst by way of the penny stock trade to heading a major Wall St. firm. But less than halfway in Scorcese begins to audition acts for a comedy show slowing the pace in favor of DiCaprio and company giving us some stooge slapstick and dense straight man in scenes that neither build or deliver, just eat up endless minutes. The hedonistic office orgies, DiCaprio pep talks, the lust for coke, the reverence for Quaalude we get the first time, enough already.DiCaprio also starts strong but is asked or was given free reign to emote beyond audience patience and he staggers to the finish with one over the top outburst after the next. A scene (one of many) where a nostalgic return to some revered drug goes awry and we are treated to Lenny crawling from the interior of a dwelling down the stairs across the lot and into his Ferrari. It is a scene emblematic of Scorcese's self indulgence and sluggish pace. Halving it (no less) may have salvaged it. At least it would not have wasted so much of your time.The rest of the cast is relegated to throwaway inanity (save for a charismatic cameo by Matt McConaughy as a high powered trader) and team spirit in one noisy scene after the next that just goes in the same circle over and over and over eventuating in a dull payoff. Face it, his films have gotten longer and lousier. The Wolf of Wall St. has no bite it simply howls and howls and howls.",4,17,36,31 December 2013
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hollywood Valentine bouquet looks pretty but eventually wilts.
","Hail, Caesar is a nostalgic tribute to Hollywood movie studios by the Coen brothers that follows a day in the life of famed Hollywood fixer Eddie Mannix(Josh Brolin). Covering a myriad of both small and large problems from quitting smoking to saving careers from scandal Caesar is filled with wonderful set pieces, funny arch characters and incidentals but as a whole a scattered mess that doesn't deliver much of a story.Mannix's day begins rousting a movie siren from career disaster as he pays off cops and cuffs her a few times for her blundering. It's then off to confession where he is racked by lying to his wife about quitting smoking. Then it's a day of keeping religious leaders content, an aquatic star's pregnancy secret and gossip columnists at bay; mulling a job offer with Lockheed and paying off a cabal of commie writers who have kidnapped studio star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney).Hail, Caesar has a buoyant Hollywood Confidential look that is rich in production design and well lensed by Coen regular Roger Deakins offering up some richly nourish compositions as well as flawless Busby Ballet and On the Town.. Like the rag it offers a variety of stories with characters that come across more as caricatures than real and it dilutes both tension and interest as Mannix moves from one fire to the next while attempting to avoid nicotine along the way.Brolin's brooding Mannix is spot on but his simmering intensity begs for a meatier plot with higher stakes. Ralph Fiennes and Scarlet Johannes are both broad and hilarious while Francis McDormand in a brief cameo as a film editor nearly steals the film in under two minutes as does Alan Ehrenreich in a lengthier piece as amiable singing cowboy Hobie Doyle. Did I also mention Tilda Swinton playing twin gossip columnists doing the same? Even with the surfeit of entertaining performances the story scatters and it is left up to fans and historians to drain a semblance of interest from the veiled and blatant references to Ester Williams, Tyrone Power, John Wayne, Carmen Miranda, Loretta Young, George Cukor, Clark Gable while using using Paramount and Warner Studios as backdrops to the fictitious Capital Pictures in the film.With its sleek and colorful mid 20th century look, a half dozen fun performances and some outstanding choreography on land and water Hail, Caesar is filled with entertaining moments but is more a three ring circus than a cohesive story telling and it ultimately disappoints.",6,1,5,8 February 2016
American Gangster," Dead Movie Walking
","Ridley Scott makes an awful lot of noise in his well heeled films and says very little. American Gangster is no exception. This glossy and slick looking tale about a Harlem drug kingpin and the cop that brought his empire down is a slow moving, disjointed and suspenseless two and a half hour bore. Even though the film primarily focuses on its two main characters they never really develop much from the first reel. Gangster Denzel Washington moves Sphinx like throughout the film. Looking like he stepped off the cover of GQ, his handsome sinister look never really takes off and when he does go into an occasional rage, it is unconvincing and inconsistent to a character that sleep walks through most of the film. The opening scene immediately establishes the savagery Lucas is willing to administer to maintain power but then the rest of the film is spent attempting to sanitize him. Russell Crowe, a lot more animated, is terrible as well but for different reasons. Once again he is the working class stiff super hero who can do no wrong as he maintains a squeaky clean honesty throughout, refusing bribes, turning in partners and bucking a law enforcement system that seems to be totally corrupt. In addition he is working his way through law school which will give him added superpowers in the films epilogue and of course he manages to screw hot chicks, display his tough guy and sensitive side and on more than one occasion step in to save the day. His only flaw seems to be his lack of fatherly attention to his son. However even this is assuaged when his wife goes into a tirade about his poor parenting skills but is quickly mollified by his martyr like explanation. A sense of shame comes across her face. Even though her outburst is justified it's hard to hate this gruff but lovable shaggy dog, the most honest man in all of New York. While too much time is wasted on Detective Roberts story it does enable director Scott to juxtapose heavy handed irony all over the place. On Thanksgiving, straight arrow Roberts sits home in a cluttered apartment having a sandwich of dry turkey and potato chips. Meanwhile at the Lucas mansion Scott creates a wonderful mise en scene that evokes a Norman Rockwell Saturday Evening Post cover. He likes it so much that he replicates it later in the film. Much of the film is overkill with repeated montages of violence and intravenous drug use. Scott shows a real nostalgia (along with the requisite cheap shot Hollywood interpretation of a racist, antisemitic, incompetent portrayal of government officials) for the Seventies but it never gets below the surface. It is all gloss and pose and lacks the passion and realism of the excellent 70's cop films, The French Connection and Serpico which it attempts to imitate.National treasure Ruby Dee is treated just like one and her performance as Frank's mother reflects it. It is one of many failed opportunities by Scott to flesh out Lucas as a man through his relationships with family and friends. The one with his wife is nearly invisible. Her major contribution to the film is getting the reserved Lucas to dress up like Super Fly. Josh Brolin's corrupt Detective Trupo is the film's only bright spot. He portrays a fierceness and intensity far more convincing than anything else in this entire film. American Gangster deserves the death penalty.",4,18,34,3 November 2007
The Wrestler," Art imitates life in The Wrestler
","The Wrestler is a scrappy independent with a well worn look about it that features a towering performance by the worse for wear Mickey Rourke as an over the hill grappler long past his prime. Rourke an 80's sex symbol (9 1/2 Weeks)made a career change to professional boxing in the 90s and has been considered washed up for some time until now. Gone are the movie star looks and brimming self confidence replaced now with a weathered and battered (the creation of good punches and bad plastic surgery)face that ideally fits the character of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, has been wrestler.The Ram who used to pack arenas is now in the twilight of his career picking up matches when he can for lighter payoffs that allow him to catch up on his rent at the trailer park. When he suffers a near fatal heart attack after a graphically bloody fight that includes staple guns he is left with few options. He attempts to readjust by getting a job at a supermarket deli, reconnecting with his daughter and making a go of it with a stripper(Marisa Tomei)but the promise of all are dashed by Randy's inability to adjust normally outside the ring. So it's back to the canvas one more time for a highly publicized good payday match.Rourke has at least a half dozen powerful scenes that are truly moving. Realizing he's been a screw up in everything but wrestling he clumsily tries to make a go of it with a daughter that's bitter but willing to give him one more chance and the aging dancer who is faced with a similar situation. Tomei as Cassidy and Evan Rachel Wood as his daughter chip in with fine emotionally real performances that don't hesitate to call Randy out on past and present transgressions.Director Aron Aronofsky establishes 'The Ram's' bleak situation early but balances the story throughout by injecting a good deal of dark humor into situations. It doesn't move as maniacally as his Requiem for a Dream but there is some fine use of hand held camera-work and some striking compositions such as when he is retrieving his van after being released from the hospital that serve as perfect metaphor. Like Requiem he refuses the easy way out with his storySince it's a well traveled theme there's a little cliché and a lot of gratuitous violence in the Wrestler but Rourke along with able assists from Tomei and Wood convincingly convey the daunting melancholia of being worn down by life.",8,1,1,30 March 2009
Inception," Limbo crock
","One has to look no further than at this two and one half hour bag of hot air to understand why American film is on life support. In what would have made for an absorbing thirty minute Twilight Zone episode in the mid sixties has been (through the wonder of technology) turned into a flashy and noisy blockbuster as director Chris Nolan applies lipstick to this pig by the bucket. Cobb (Leonard DiCaprio) is a dream stealer in a land and time not far from now. He's particularly valuable to corporations keen on getting an edge on competitors but now in order to go legit and see his kiddies again he must do the reverse. Impossible you say, not in Chris Nolan's fantasy land of computer generated gimmickry and circuitous dialog.Inception's slick dishonesty lies in the parallel universe of the real and unreal worlds Nolan creates in an attempt to humanize its disheveled super hero by giving it a patina of reality and generate sympathy for Cobb. But Cobb along with everyone else acts like a stilted automaton (or Joe Friday from Dragnet) and while it try's redistributing its weight to give balance to the money shots (you know the fireworks) it comes across mawkish and syrupy. The premise itself is hashed and rehashed ad nauseum and so much one gets the idea that the producers are not only attempting to blind with shock and awe but confuse you with non-sequitors in hopes of successfully cloning you to buy another ticket.Even in the real world it is based Inception remains a fairy tale working off the borderless freedom of fantasy where things don't have to be logical just convenient. Nolan was far more successful in bringing the fantasy reality factor closer together in Insomnia and Memento. There was a grittier tension in these low budgets that Nolan has lost since hitting the big time and having at his disposal a huge budget for all star casts ( mostly wasted in minor roles here) and exotic locales to play out his ideas. These productions (Batmans plus The Prestige) may spare no expense but they lack soul and usually flounder mid way.While the blame can be clearly affixed to the the shoulders of writer, producer, director Nolan I would be remiss not to acknowledge cinematographer Wally Pfister's murky and dull compositions and Hans Zimmers relentless music score which plays like a leaky faucet throughout the entire film. Like an IV it attempts to transfuse suspense into the plot with an annoying undercurrent and the occasional crash of brass.",3,13,24,16 August 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," Suicide on the Re-make Express
","Even if it had not been done before (and very well at that) this return trip on The Orient Express turns out to be a rather tepid mystery excursion. Given its cast and author's (Agatha Christie) pedigree it lags well behind the locomotive powering it as director/ lead Ken Branagh gets sloppy with wasteful incidentals and issues unrelated to the mystery at hand.Hercule Poirot agrees to hitching a ride on The Orient Express from Istanbul to Paris. When a shady character (Johnny Depp) is brutally offed, Poirot is enlisted to solve the crime with a captive audience of suspects in a snowbound train waiting for AAA to rescue them. While I find the story to be one of Christie's more unsatisfying offerings it does offer up a dozen fun characters and suspects that can allow major stars a chance to ham it up. The cast is A list (Judy Dench, Derek, Jacobi, Michelle Pfieffer, Penelope Cruz, William Dafoe) but the performances mostly D as they are barely able to muster guilty expressions. There are some fine montages of the locomotive flexing its powerful muscles but moments where it looks like an American Flyer set up in a department store window as it moves through the snow covered terrain. It is impossible for me not to mention the 74 classic if only to highly recommend it as well as the managing of the cast in comparison's to Branagh's half inspired handling of his. Director Sidney Lumet (12 Angry Men) excelled at balancing and involving his cast who nearly to a member give wonderful broad performances. Branagh on the other hand lowers his suspect count, all but ignoring some of the other passengers implicated. Branagh himself is little less than a mawkish ghost of the brilliant Albert Finney's Poirot who conducted on stage the energy and fun that is missing in this present day version, it is simply the little engine that couldn't. It should have never left the station.",4,1,6,17 November 2017
Sherlock Holmes," Latest take on Sherlock all noise and set design.
","Same super hero different costume and era in this crass, abrasive and sloppy take on the world's most famous detective. Robert Downey Jr. as the scruffy Sherlock is more Indiana Jones than London Holmes as he battles a Bela Lugosi attired villain and other imposing cliché bad guys in what amounts to the usual loud and violent devoid of introspection formulaic pap that lines them up at the box office these days. For those it should not disappoint.Ham fisted director Guy Ritchie delivers scene after scene of action blood and gore across London where it climaxes at the semi completed London Bridge in predictable style along with the requisite franchise blockbuster serial ending promising a sequel. Save for Sherlock's ambiguous homo-erotic inclinations towards Dr. Watson nothing is left to subtlety.D Jr. does bring a roguish charm to the character of Sherlock (as well as many of his Iron Man qualities) but too little of the implacable deductive grace and style. Ritchie instead elects to have Holmes deductive powers announced by way of blinding flashes across the screen like light bulbs in comic strips. Jude Law's Watson is also an action figure while the female leads are more scrawny than fatale though one displays some trendy karate kicks in a nod I guess to market research.What does make this Sherlock Holmes for its time somewhat palatable is the rich set designs, costuming and CGI evoking Victorian London in both its majesty and squalor. But then again Masterpiece Theatre does the same thing every time it does a Dickens or an Austen. This comic book Holmes shows you can dress something up but it is no guarantee it will have any manners.",5,1,5,29 January 2010

Things quickly take a turn however when the housekeeper returns for something she left behind.Working with basically two class defining sets Parasite is a well filmed an interesting watch with the plot slowly unfolding in a darkly comic fashion before going into self induced chaotic free fall from the plausible to the absurd with a hurried climax and unsatisfying epilogue. Director Joon Ho-Bong and cinematographer Kyong pyo Hong do an excellent job of contrasting settings, situations, jabs about class and characters early, equally dividing the roles of his adult characters all benign and petty in their own way. It adds to the fascination of where this slightly off balance plot is going when the wheels come off. With no end game to the plot Ho-Bong decides to end it in conflagration and an insipid post climax that demands it defy logic.",6,15,29,13 November 2019
Paths of Glory," 'Glory' part of Kubrick's path to greatness.
","With the exception of Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front (29), Paths of Glory is probably the most powerful anti-war film ever made, clearly laying the blame for such obscene waste of life at the feet of vainglorious officers in ruthless pursuit of advancement. By 1916 of World War 1 the armies of France and Germany find themselves battling to a standoff in a quagmire decorated in barbed wire known as 'No Man's Land'. The 107th infantry stationed in the trenches on the front line is overextended and undermanned from casualties. The battalion commander, General Mireau (George Mac Cready) at first begs off an attack on 'The Ant Hill', a near impregnable position, for these reasons. But when General Broulard (Adolfe Menjou) offers him promotion Mireau quickly does an about face and agrees to the suicidal attack. When it fails miserably, Mireau attempting to deflect blame demands that enlisted men be chosen as examples and tried for cowardice, the penalty of which is death in front of a firing squad.From the beautifully choreographed dance for death between the cold hearted generals in the lavish country mansion to the grippingly taut tracking shots through the trenches and the attack across No Man's Land director Stanley Kubrick's visual artistry is well in evidence as he draws striking contrast between those who make war and those who fight it. The generals live in lavish spacious quarters while in filthy squalor the infantry hug trench walls under constant shelling. The trial itself is a mockery, with the impeccably dressed General Mireau lounging in an 18th Century love seat interrupting the proceedings as he sees fit while the accused look awkward and out of place in rumpled uniforms. Kubrick skillfully gives the proceedings a chess board look with these three pawns surrounded by knights and kings.As the ruthlessly ambitious generals, Menjou and Mac Cready look very much at home festooned in beautifully tailored uniforms, billeted in palaces. The war is a game to them as well as an opportunity for advancement. If it takes massive loss of life to achieve objective then so be it. As the bridge between officer and enlisted man Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax is omniscient witness to the cold inhumanity being practiced on the battle field as well as in the drawing room. Douglas gives one of his finest performances restrained in part by the fact he must be an officer and maintain control and not give vent to emotion. In the court room he fights passionately for his men, but on the battle field he must lead by example and his stoic demeanor as he moves through the trenches before going over the top in the attack scene solidifies his perfect fit as Dax. This is the first in what I consider Kubrick's run of superb films between 1957 and 1970. The topic is controversial (it was banned in France, Germany and Spain),the telling sardonic. Jump cutting gives the film a rapid rush to judgment pace and those incredible tracking shots evident in so many of his films are powerfully employed throughout Paths. The music score other than percussion and military drumming is confined to two scenes but used to maximum effect, especially in the film's finale. Paths of Glory is a rare combination of form and content flawlessly carried off by a cinema icon presenting a message that resonates just as powerfully today as it did back then.",10,1,2,8 August 2008
Marriage Story," Domestic Blisters
","Charlie Barber (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson looks like they have reached the end of the line in the marriage department. More a question of growing apart than exerting cruelty upon one another she moves to LA to do a series while Charlie a theatre director remains in NY. What remains important is access to their son and the semi-amicable break-up gets ugly when it gets litigious.Marriage Story is a high gloss soap opera in the tradition of Kramer versus Kramer featuring fine performances from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansen as the marital combatants. The split is not due to unbridled hatred for each other but lack of communication in which there is more frustration than rage. Writer director Noah Bombach's real villains in the piece are the down and dirty lawyers (played with relish by Laura Dern and Ray Liotta) and the divorce laws that can bankrupt both financially and morally a family.Driver and Johansen display an excellent discordant chemistry with each other amid sterile settings that Baumbach applies some subtle incidentals to but the argumentation eventually grows repetitive with some moments contrived, others rushed and sloppy such as the one in which Charlie is being served. Piling on the suds Randy Newman contributes a score of heart tugging strings and woodwinds that give the impression you are watching a Hallmark Channel film with four letter words. Outside of the lead performances an overlong, banal coast to coast melodrama that goes in circles.",6,3,9,5 January 2020
Raging Bull," Scorsese and Di Nero's unbeatable one-two punch.
","Robert Di Nero wins his Oscar early and often as Jake Lamotta in Martin Scorcese's bio of the former middleweight boxing champion, Raging Bull. Di Nero pulls no punches as he gives one of the most unsympathetic portrayals of an actual living person ever shown on screen. From the buff middleweight in his prime to a punchy nite club entertainer Di Nero delivers the most brutal male performance in American film since Brando's Stanley Kowalski in Streetcar. La Motta, an up and coming boxer is finding it hard to get a title shot by not paying respect to local mob figures. Possessing a volcanic temper and more than a hint of paranoia he is incapable of settling any matters without his fists. Violent both inside and outside the ring he slowly erodes the loyalty of his wife and manager brother with his paranoid outbursts and physical beatings. Never has a fighter been more deserved of his nick name than this raging bull.Providing a magnificent stage for this uncaged animal, Martin Scorsese is unrelenting in his depiction of La Motta and the 'sweet science'. Moving and jabbing with slow mo and jump cut he vividly conveys the brutality of the sport so graphically that it could make the case for its abolishment. In color it would be unwatchable. In the skillful hands of Scorsese though it becomes blood drenched poetry. From the Cavalara Rusticana serenading of La Motta shadow boxing, tightly edited fight scenes depicting the fury, to his meticulous detail of flesh and fluids Scorsese moves his film along gracefully as well as with force. The tracking shot that follows Jake from his dressing room to the center of the ring for his title fight against Marcel Cerdan is one of his best not only in terms of logistics but also in the story lines eb and flow. It is the moment that La Motta has been waiting for his entire career and Scorsese beautifully allows the audience to be part of his entourage in this crowning moment. Scorsese also skillfully utilizes sound as a smooth transitional device. His use of ambient noise from tenements and the local pool as Jake pursues future wife Vicki counterpoints La Motta's ring roar confidence and momentarily softens him in this toned down arena.Joe Pesci as his manager brother and Cathy Moriarty as wife Vicki both offer splendid support as they hold their own in every scene with Di Nero. Battered but tough in their own way they soldier on as long as they can with the impossible Jake whose biggest fight remains with himself.This is the best of all Scorsese/Di Nero teamings and probably the best work they ever did individually. It is a tough watch that may have you checking yourself for bruises and blood splatter as you leave the theatre but their is no denying its mesmerizing form and brilliant performance. Raging Bull is a winner by unanimous decision.",10,3,5,30 March 2008
Black Panther," New look super hero is welcome addition.
","Black Panther is a generic super hero semi sci-fi grounded on earth featuring the offbeat casting of an all black cast in the first feature of another Star War's franchise. With it's pacifist warrior lead (Chadwick Boseman) it offers up a less stoic more in touch with his feelings super hero that resonates beyond the action with underlying statement but ultimately relies on it's bread an butter action to seal the deal.Oakland gang banger and rightful heir to the throne of Wakanda, C'halla, is recalled to his country to take up the crown and deal with a crisis involving vibranium, the key to the country's incredibly advanced society. C'halla would like to promote the technology to help oppressed people throughout the world but it has fallen into the wrong hands and his attempts to retrieve it are being distracted by challengers from the throne; first from the imposing mountain people and then a crass one man war machine from the USA by the name of Kilmonger (Michael B. jordan). Kilmonger is no pretender to the throne however and is allowed rightful challenge to the crown.Panther breaks no new ground as the first all black Hollywood production but it certainly is a step forward in the evolution of the black film in Hollywood from the well intentioned Halleluah (29) to the talent laden Cabin in the Sky ( 43) to the abysmal The Wiz. Unlike the cliches, the patronizing and mocking (in the case of The Wiz just an incredible waste of talent) Black Panther maintains its dignity from end to end but most importantly offers a welcome twist to the Marvel franchise to film in setting, character and plot.Boseman is an approachable an amiable breath of fresh air without the stilted stoicism as the super hero, his actions involving a lot more familial activity with a precocious sister to play off as well as have a partner with a backbone. This well grounded humanity may serve him well in future episodes, creating problems and missteps on his part, causing him to drop his guard when it calls for steel resolve, enabling for chaos and confrontation and allowing the action fantasy film to do what it does best in this age of technology, speed, blowing things up and super human effort in making the Universe a better place.",7,2,6,18 March 2018
Iron Man," Scrap Metal
","It's loud, it's lame and after all of the hype should make a trillion dollars as the same ready to mix super hero recipe follows all of the directions in this overcooked CGI spectacular of blowin' things up real good. Updated from its comic book beginnings to our present century of world terror I M villains are the usual suspects of semi-literate hateful Afghans and greedy American capitalists strikingly familiar to the same difficult types encountered by Super,Spider and Bat mans.Tony Stark, brilliant inventor and mega rich arms dealer goes through a moral conversion after being wounded and captured by Afghan terrorists. Managing to build an armor plated flying suit under the eyes of his moronic captors he escapes to fight another day, this time in a really neat looking metallic model. When Tony wants to do a one eighty with the business his evil partner attempts to thwart him. Who shall win this titanic struggle of good and evil? Who cares. We're here to be visually mesmerized and that we are but only for brief periods and with the same twists and turns crashes and explosions that every mega budgeted fiction fantasy flic offers.Robert Downey Jr. as the I Man is a brilliant piece of marketing in art imitating life. The one time drug sodden loser like the comic book character has managed to rise Phoenix like from the ashes of a ruined career and parlay it into what looks to be a mega money maker for the next decade. Downey is the right choice but hardly tested as an actor since a super hero's emotional range is very limited (it's the reason villains are so much more interesting)but he does manage to bring a cool hipness to the square super hero model. Jeff Bridges overacts a tad with an evil Daddy Warbucks impression and Gwyneth Paltrow as suffering girl Friday Pepper Potts seems to be in the downward spiral Downey was with the culprit not being drugs but lack of talent.The special effects are predictably spectacular and there's a heavy metal music score to bludgeon you along the way as the assembly line plot unfolds with less grace than the first Spiderman and even less humor and suspense than Robo-Cop. You seen one you seen 'em all. This is a newer but not improved hybrid model of a crowded field and it is more tin than iron.",5,7,16,31 May 2008
Blade Runner," Rain comes to LA
","Something has happened between 1982 and 2019 that has turned arid LA into grimy Tacoma but that is the least of former cop Rick Decker's (Harrison Ford) problems as he grudgingly takes a job whacking replicants, robots imbued with identical human features and actions. Seems four of them rebelled somewhere beyond earth, killing their masters and now were heading for home. Deckard is an expert on replicants and hates them as part of a warped technology that has ruined the universe yet he falls for one (Sean Young). It does not cloud his thinking however as he ruthlessly pursues and 'retires' the replicants.Submerged in futuristic noir ambiance and with Ford our stoic Bogart, Blade Runner is an entertaining vicarious midway shooting gallery where the hunted are mere robots. None are programmed very nice to begin with as Deckard dispatches them amid shadow, neon and rain when in the film's climactic moment Roy the replicant played by Rutger Hauer is allowed a King Kong moment of provocative introspection. Ford is a lot darker than his Solo in this futuristic manhunt, more cynical, sarcastic and finer in a different way. Sean Young has the right fatale look, Hauer is intense and M.Emmett Walsh gives it a real noir stamp with brief his presence.The real star of the picture though is the dazzling production design provided by Laurence Paul along with the art direction of Paul Snyder, some wonderful special effects and if I can step away from my snobbery, an impressive music score by Vangellis.With much of everything in order however Director Scott allows the film to run a solid half hour too long forsaking the compact storytelling that noir crime dramas depend. Add to this the fact most of the main characters are robots Blade Runner simply runs too long for the same payoff reducing the punch while admittedly giving us more time to admire the impressive furniture.",7,0,1,29 October 2017
The Greatest Showman," Showman's a little too slick and shy for its own good.
","Showman / conman PT Barnum gets the same kid glove treatment Flo Ziegfeld received in 1937 with this antiseptic look at his life and legacy. Filled with a fair share of catchy tunes, a couple of impressive dance numbers and lush production values it mawkishly keeps things saccharine to the point of not allowing PT's kids to grow up over a period of years along with shouldering singer Jenny Lind with the blame regarding her nebulous relationship with Barnum when he had her under contract. It's understandable for a musical to do so but the story in this case is too timid to maintain the energy level between musical numbers.The dance segments are simply over edited cheating the audience out of a more fully fleshed out Hugh Jackman performance. A major broadway performer and fine hoofer, Jackman's numbers are simply cut to pieces in jump cuts that reduce him to a twirling top. Director Gracery also shortchanges his dance troupe as well by truncating movement and allowing the camera to move more than the dancers, the editor's blade obliterating their abilities and contribution. The numbers are slick and energized but at great disservice to the talent performing it and the audience being denied it.",5,2,4,23 January 2018
La Vie En Rose," Madmoiselle Sings the Blues
","La Mome is a biography about the street waif turned French National Treasure, Edith Piaf. The Little Sparrow as she was known led a tragic life of immense proportion before dying at the age of 47 making her story tailor made for a film bio, but in spite of this plethora of material, the makers disjoint the whole affair by juggling the chronology.From a depraved childhood filled with abuse and horror the scrawny but scrappy Piaf fends off a pimp, is discovered then ruined through scandal is re-discovered falls in love with a world champion fighter, becomes drug dependent and eventually gives up the ghost. You will never listen to a Piaf song in the same way again.As Piaf, Marion Cotillard ages and suffers convincingly but she does occasionally lapse into a buffoonish wide eyed Lucy routine along the way. Her sidekick Momone is like Bresson's Mouchette reaching adulthood. You want to throw her into the Seine. The rest of the cast including Gerard Deperadieu are just well dressed and forgettable.In addition to the film's confusing storyline director, co-writer Olivier Dahan relies on too much screaming and yelling from his actors to bring drama to his scenes. The story lags toward the end since flash forwards reveal where Piaf is headed earlier in the film. There is also an inexplicable waste of time devoted to a Marcel Cerdan fight which is given too much weight to the biography. Of course there is the music but you can save yourself a lot of time by buying the CD taking her biography out of the library, sit home and sip a good red. This film will only make you see red.",5,18,26,23 February 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Luke warm Woody short on comedy and drama.
","Woody Allen has all but exhausted his neurotic comedy routine in this dull and vapid tale of romantic intrigue and sexual tension. He's taken the show on the road to Barcelona, Spain and installed female characters (with the assistance of a male narrator) to verbalize the same anxieties that Fielding Melish, Alvy Singer and Danny Rose turned into comic brilliance.In Vicky Christina Barcelona we are presented with two American women, one grounded, one scattered who fall under the spell of a magnetic Spanish painter with Picasso bravado. Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) has little trouble bedding the free spirited Christina (Scarlet Johannsen)which to his dismay is short circuited when she comes down with food poisoning. Vicky, engaged to be married, resists Juan Antonio until the the right blend of Spanish guitar and wine do the trick. Humiliated by her backtracking she hides the truth from Christina who becomes heavily involved with Juan and moves in with him. Conflicted Vicky meanwhile agrees to marry her boyfriend in Barcelona. Back at Juan's place, passionate and unstable ex-wife Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz) moves in with him and Christina and spices things up.VCB is neither complex or convoluted, it's just plain dull. Vicky and Christine mouth much of the same in-certitudes and anxieties found in most of Allen's films while displaying confident intellectual banter and newly discovered artistic talent. Vicky soaks up Gaudy and Catalonian culture and drones on about 'turgid intellectual imperative' while Christina in under two months is on the road to becoming the next Cartier Bresson. In unabashed stereotyping Allen utilizes his 'hot blooded' Spanish leads to bring and instill passion into the proceedings but his tepid dialogue and action prevent it from building and it is left to a narrator to move things along.After nearly forty years of film making Allen has become a genre in himself. He was a major player during American film's last Golden Age in the 70's but since the late 80's has been hit or miss (mostly miss) with similar scenarios, dialogue and characters lifted from previous films. Farrow and Keaton have been replaced by Johansson and Barcelona pinch hits for New York City but Woody remains Woody and the lipstick he attempts to puts on this pig smudges quickly.",5,5,14,25 August 2008
Amélie," A Whimsical Paris Tale
","Amelie as it is known in the states is a warm sweet tale of a young Parisian girl who decides to practice random acts of kindness with neighbors and strangers. The thought aside, it is Amelie's methods that give the film its joie de vivre as she races around Paris concocting ideas that will bring a little light into the otherwise melancholy, hum-drum existence of co-workers, a concierge, a blind man and a stranger that she reconnects to his past. All does not go according to plan in some instances but that only adds to the infectious frenetic pace that transitions so well between reality and fantasy.As Amelie, waif like Audrey Tautou resembles a young Audrey Hepburn with a more impish demeanor and devious streak. All her acts are not out of kindness and an act of revenge on a fruit seller is comic and ingenious. With a character and look that falls somewhere between Chaplin and Giulietta Masina in La Strada it remains impossible not to fall for her charm.Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's assemblage is tour de force. His opening montage of scenes that reveals Amelie's life growing up is skillfully edited and juxtaposed with a narration delivered at a break neck speed that dilutes the gloom with dark humor. His excessive use of wide angle and tracking shots and zooms all seem appropriate to a style that bursts with energy throughout. The music score partners wonderfully with the pace and it gives the film an even more joyful trajectory. He also utilizes the Paris setting well (especially the Sacre Coeur area)without becoming self conscious. Part of the film's attraction lies in the great city but Jeunet never let's it get in the way of his characters. Amelie may be populated by glum, lonely people and topics that deal with loss of opportunity and dreams but Jeunet's audacious style turns it into a celebration of life by providing what Amelie does for those around her.

Moonrise Kingdom," Pee Wee Territory
","With it's self indulgent silliness and juvenile mise en scene Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom is situated smack dab in the middle of Pee Wee Herman country. Herman's childish surreal world along with Pee Wee's boundless enthusiasm made for some must see Saturday morning viewing but in small doses and Kingdom's clever little world starts to approach tedium about a Playhouse episode in.Dealing with the awkwardness of childhood Khaki Scout Sam meets Suzy, a disgruntled twelve year old living on the island of New Penzance in the 60s. Both are less than satisfied with their living situations and plot to run off together. When they do Scoutmaster Ward (Edward Norton) mobilizes the troop to hunt the AWOL Sam down while the Bishops (Bill Murray, Francis Mc Dormand) alert Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) daughter Suzy has flown the coop with cat, books and record player. In the mean time a powerful storm is making its way towards the island.Anderson's signature passion for pastels and killing dogs are in place as he builds this parable/parody with cutesy geometric compositions and self conscious set design that like everything else becomes wearisome fast. His adult quartet of stars for the most part sleepwalk through their parts, especially McDormand whose been in a permanent fog for years. Tilda Swinton's arch turn representing Civil Service comes across as an abrasive new age Margaret Hamilton from Oz while Willis and Murray walk around with scowls, confused. As troop leader Ward, Norton's crisp uniform does most of the talking.With his generic and banal storyline Anderson put's nearly all his emphasis on the precious look of his film and he certainly chose location wisely ( I cycle past some of the locations regularly) with Narragansett Bay and its islands. But as in all of Anderson's colorfully drab (The Darjeeling Express, The Royal Tanenbaums, Life Acquatic...) efforts it fails to hold up in the second half with the imagery getting old and the plot impossible to build on outside of the same self indulgence that served the first half.",5,1,3,22 August 2013
The Producers," Brooks directorial debut sloppy, crass, hilarious.
","Mel Brooks first time out of the box as a film director pays little attention to form and lays it all on the strident mugging of his leads Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder to belt out ( and sometimes swing and miss ) broad slices of Yiddish ham that result in an uneven but very funny comedy. Brooks more or less steps back and allows Mostel free reign and it works most of the time as the blustery iconic comedian by the mere force of personality holds court over an array of supporting characters taking their lead from Zero and making the most of small heavy handed bits that produce more belly laughs than groans.Down on his luck Broadway producer Max Bialystock seduces wealthy old ladies to get capital for his productions. When an insecure accountant (Wilder) comes to look at the books he gives max an idea on how to make a fortune; produce a failure. Max then sets out to get the worst possible play, directors and performers while stepping up his seductions. The Producers gives you the feeling Brooks is making things up along the way. Its oddly episodic with an array of patchwork meetings and rendezvous with one kooky character after another that either hits or misses and most of it hits before teetering on too much absurdity. Brooks frantic style goes well with Max's desperate plan but he does lay it on a little too long and too thick at times. Mostel is a life force unto himself and more for better than worse allowed to do as he pleases. Wilder's malleable lack of fortitude partners well with Zero and a handful of precious bits by Kenneth Mars, Dick Shawn, Christopher Hewett and 84 year old Estelle Winwood insure a steady steam of hilarious moments in keeping with a film that deals with putting on a musical called Springtime for Hitler. Brooks as a director would go on to get a better handle on film grammar in future films. Much of the Producers is shot in close-up though a Busby Berkeley moment and a casting call for Hitler types show him to be just as effective in his intent when he pulls his camera back. But the bottom line would always be about producing laughs and The Producers delivers droves of them.",8,0,1,21 February 2011
Munich," Spielberg mangles Munich
","Steven Spielberg has about as much success with Munich as Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain did when he met with Hitler there in 1939. Spielberg uses as his catalyst the 1972 massacre of Israeli Olympic athletes by Palestinian terrorists to deliver a semi-factual rambling disjointed, political, suspense film that tries to have it both ways as statement and entertainment. It fails on both accounts and Spielberg's confusion and indecision is clearly the culprit. The film opens grippingly with with the hostage taking scene at the Olympic Village. Then rather than play out the whole incident, Spielberg jumps to the aftermath, decision making and actions to avenge the killings. For the rest of the film flashbacks of the event shove their way back into the plot with unintended meaning. In a scene where the film's main protagonist makes love to his wife, Spielberg inter cuts the final violent moments of the hostage disaster. We are left to wonder if our hero is tortured or turned on by the event. Spielberg is clearly a cheerleader for Israel but he does attempt to put a human face on the Palestinian plight. Even this however comes across as patronizing and highly contrived in a scene where opposing groups have an uneasy truce at a safe house.Production values are top notch but it doesn't hide the poor editing and overall plot construction. At two hours forty-five minutes long there's plenty of time for repetitive hits and the rationalizing of such acts that could have been summed up in half the time. But Spielberg is in the act of being profound and drone on it must. The Israeli assassins are all noble and nondescript except for Avner who serves as the conscience of the cell and its actions. He is Spielberg's alter ego displaying a gung-ho hesitance but nevertheless steeling himself to commit morally objectionable acts in order to defend the homeland. The heavy handed Mr.Spielberg hammers this point home in the final scene of Munich with a distant lingering shot of the World Trade Center Towers, a taunting symbol of what our future holds and how the US will react. One is not sure if Munich is an attempt to absolve Israel of its rogue actions in reaction to the PLO, more firmly cement the bond between the two democracies as victims of terrorism or is a merely a plea for all of us to get along. In the end Spielberg's wishy washy approach as well as the abandonment of his renowned editorial skills leave us with a haphazard piece of questionable history that even doubts itself.",5,4,9,25 December 2007
Heat," Heat is stone cold bad.
","What passes for epic cinema these days can be found in Heat, a noisy, bombastic, self reverential cops and robbers bore that between gun battles drags for most of it's three hour (yes three) running time.Detective Vin Hanna (Al Pacino) is a standout cop with almost as many bad marriages as commendations. Neil MacCauley (Robert DiNero) is a career criminal always bent on the big score. Both men are very methodical and take great pride in their professionalism. After botching a brinks job Hanna pursues the gang which is beginning to fray at the edges. Mac Cauley realizes it's tough to get good help these days and decides on one last score before calling it quits.Showcasing the biggest meeting since Truman met Stalin at Potsdam director Michael Mann treats the first meeting of Pacino and DiNero together (both were in Godfather 2 but appeared in no scenes together) with the same solemnity as the two actors wheeze through their moment. With nothing new or revelatory to say, they show manly respect and understanding for each other. The problem is the scene is more about these closely identified highly regarded actors than the characters they play. Their star wattage (as well as their skills) may have dimmed by 95 but their legendary status carried a lot of weight. It's about as interesting as two old codgers reminiscing on an old folks home porch and rings hollow like the rest of this lumbering elephant of a film.The convoluted plot is filled with forgettable characters but it does allow Mann to wander around LA spreading gratuitous violence. The women in the film are relegated to looking tired and concerned over their boy friends, acting as sounding boards for the guys to spew their Mannly philosophy about honor and being true to your skills.The action scenes are big, loud, bloody, poorly edited and ridiculous as LA empties out to let the boys shoot it out in grand fashion on the streets. The badly paced montage of Al and Bobby dashing up and down the avenues with some very big weapons (size is everything to Mann)playing cops and robbers runs out of steam before they run out of bullets.By the time they made Heat Pacino and DiNero had peaked before doing self parody (though Pacino would go on to give a stellar performance worthy of his early years as Roy Cohn in Angels in America) and it shows in their lackluster tired performances magnified even further by the film stealing effort turned in by Val Kilmer as gang member Chris. Kilmer's energy and the self confident way he moves and acts delivers the passion the two stars lack.As in some of his other films Mann explores the theme of moral relativism with usual heavy handed pretension attempting to bestow nobility on the good as well as the bad, solemnizing the whole ponderous affair with Elliot Goldenthal's vapid score that is more appropriate for a coronation than a shoot'em up.In Heat MacCauley states 'Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out of in thirty seconds flat'. One should keep this in mind before watching this big helium balloon of hot air.",4,22,47,27 November 2009
Da 5 Bloods," Tribal Tedium
","Spike Lee's second war film ( Miracle of St. Anna, 2008) is one messy message picture featuring Lee's sloppy attempts at coherence. A brother bonding film of rage and self pity with more than its share of insipid dialogue, Lee attempts to inject history into the story with his occasional bias cheap shot. Scattered in every way, Lee's focus remains haphazard as he pontificates ham fistedly into nearly every scene which trail's off rather than resonate as this diffuse mess wanders from Crispus Attucks to BLM to make his point achieved so much more powerfully, summed up in one scene and decades earlier in Apocalypse, Now. Lee drags us through two and half hours to get to his. Speaking of Now, he does one of his heavy handed homages and manages to botch that as well.A quartet of four Viet vets return to the heart of darkness to retrieve their fallen leader and a huge gold supply. An abrasive but basically altruistic bunch they have to enlist some shady characters which leads to conflict while they sought out their inner one.As in many of his films we get the loose cannon threatening to upend everything and DelRoy Lindo does an excellent job here as the tortured veteran with the short fuse. Pursued by inner demons from the past he brings power to all his scenes, something lacking in the rest of Lee's bland undeveloped cast delivering banal dialogue. Lee utilizes his usual go to crutch of pop music well and the documentary footage in the early going really revs matters up but it quickly devolves into another Lee one note mantra as his band of brothers rumble through the jungle in a funk with the occasional burst of automatic weapons fire to keep the audience awake. Da 5 Bloods is a passionate but diffuse mawkish mess, unconvincingly told.",4,0,1,30 June 2020
Pineapple Express," Bummer
","American film humor in this day and age is rife with stoner sensibility. Most film comedies with contemporary settings feature it's ubiquitous presence visually or in the writing. Still federally illegal, marijuana is treated with a wink and a nod and don't ask don't tell policy by most of society while a powerful elite (the liquor lobby?, the last remnants of Puritanism?) man the barricades to prevent it from destroying Western Civilization and their profit margin. Presidents, Vice Presidents, senators and congressmen all readily admit to it's usage at one time or another and beginning in the late sixties it replaced 3D glasses as an enhancement to the film experience transforming lame films (Plan 9 from Outer Space, Dragnet) into unintentional comedies. Many a Friday night my friends an I would pass a joint (along with a quart of a cheap vodka and orange juice concoction called Tango) back and forth in the balcony at the Palace theater in Providence, RI laughing and cheering Harpo, Groucho and Chico (we booed Zeppo)as comrades in arms mocking an uptight society. In the film Pineapple Express the stoners have been removed from the balcony and put on the screen. They should have stayed in their seats.The film's title gets it's name from a super weed that is so potent and rare it gets one incessant toker to liken it to 'killing a unicorn' when put to flame. It's rarity however gets our two dazed and confused protagonists Dale (Seth Rogen) and Saul (James Franco) in a fix when Dale witnesses a murder by a drug kingpin and a cop accomplice. The boys have a real reason to be paranoid now as they are being hunted by some radically violent dudes. For the final 90 minutes of this Cheech and Chong, action film hybrid the boys alternate between high chatter and graphic violence making for one incoherent mess. It quickly becomes a victim of it's own smugness and excess with it's one note repetitive theme that quickly loses potency after ten minutes.Express has a patronising air and it's characters lack the charm and 'wit' of weed icons Cheech and Chong who more clearly defined the stoner mentality and spirit. Rogen and Franco's indecipherable whining most of the film is a very poor substitute for the ideal high guy inflection exhibited by Tommy Chong in film and record and the movie itself going in circles gets tired very fast. Straight or stoned The Pineapple Express is one bad trip.",3,5,10,19 August 2008
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," A Unique and Original Comedy Classic
","In spite of Viet Nam, Watergate and gas shortages the 70's was a period of superb film humor. Giants like Woody Allen and Mel Brooks were in their prime and British export Monty Python had established a beach front on American television. When the Python's released their first feature length film audiences expected waves of absurdity and 'silliness'. They received more. Based (or spring boarded) on the Arthurian legend of the quest for the Holy Grail, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is screamingly hilarious from its opening credits to its final scene. Coconuts, killer rabbits, flying cows and holy hand grenades fill the landscape as the Python troupe immerse themselves in multiple roles, skewering legend and establishment with their surreal brand of humor. They all shine individually but Cleese as dimwitted Lancelot, Tim the Enchanter, a witch burner and a castle guard with an 'outrageous French accent' is most memorable for me. There is also the creative collage animation of Terry Gilliam which fits seamlessly into the zaniness of the location footage by transitioning without a break in storyline or humor from one knight's adventure to the next. In addition to its abundance of original non-stop laughs, attention to detail in ambiance and composition (Gilliam directed the camera work, Terry Jones the actors) gives Grail an impressive look. Castles, forests, a Viking Ship are photographed in epic style giving the film a high gloss while at the same time heightening the comic absurdity. I was a year out of college when Grail was released. I had no steady job and no prospects but I saw this film eight times in that year (a personal record to this day) and that alone made it a very good year.",10,6,10,11 August 2007

","For every Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Simon and Garfunkel in the early 60s you probably had a thousand Llewyn Davis's; semi talented folkies who kept the dream alive by starving and crashing at other peoples pads, straining for that break, the brass ring remaining elusive. Inside Llewyn Davis is a week in the life of one aspirant whose dream is mostly a nightmare.Davis (Oscar Issac) opens with our protagonist warbling a melancholy tune at a Greenwich Village coffee house where neophytes try their luck. After his set he gets punched out by a mysterious stranger in the alley, finds out he has a fellow folkie pregnant, is being grossly under represented by his agent and has it revealed to him that he is a dad with a two year old in Akron. He is also sidled with a friends cat that he eventually abandons. He decides to try his luck in Chicago when he has opportunity to hitch a ride with a jazz artist and poet. Chicago it turns out is as welcoming as NYC and he is soon headed back after an audition that offers some daylight which he rejects outright.The Brothers Coen once again deliver a unique and original character in the self absorbed, irresponsible Davis. A moody ungrateful sponger you still find yourself rooting for him as he chases the elusive dream of making it big while refusing to confront reality. The overall narrative itself however is loose and raggedy with a patchwork quilt of stilted scenes and our hero literally going in circles with the contrived road trip, though John Goodman as the zonked out jazz cat does have a moment dissembling folk with his jazz comparison.The Coens do an excellent job of utilizing the cold harsh winter to emphasize Davis's wearying struggle as well as portray the times by lining the sidewalks and some expansive shots with massive eight cylinder behemoths covered in winter grime. There is also a wonderfully energized scene where Davis and the boys do a studio take of a Ray Stevens ( Please Mr. Custer, Alley Oop) type comedy tune popular back then that lifts Inside from its morose gloom momentarily before Llewlyn once again self implodes by signing away the royalties for cash upfront.The Coens are once again to be commended for continually going against the grain of formulaic main stream film in both character and scenario but with Davis little of the supporting cast is fleshed out and the ancillary characters that inform their past works with telling incidentals fail to register amid the glum theme here and the film like one of the Oldsmobile 88s mired in a snow bank spins its wheels much of the time.",6,8,14,15 January 2014
Her," Dreary Jonze My Mother the Car update lacks its humor.
","There comes a juncture in 'her' where you are either going to go with it or bail on the plot conceit where a professional letter writer falls head over heels in love with a board operating system while passing up a series of opportunities with a trio of girls with perfect skin in smog choking, impersonal LA. Get the picture? There isn't one, of her, that is. Call me heartless if you will but I am of the former. I just cannot get myself psyched watching Theodore, belt-less pants hitched above his belly button as he swoons for the invisible girl even if it is helped along somewhat by the idea of Scarlet Johannson's Claude Raines turn. One has to come to terms with the fact that if Jonze had the courage of conviction to see this through in all its absurdest glory he would not be utilizing the very recognizable voice of one of the hottest babes in Hollywood to soften his concept and literally paint a picture for you. If you want proof I offer up the ridiculous rush by critics to give awards to Scarlet for her invisible performance. Might an anonymous voice hold the nuance to reach such a level without pedigree? 'her' starts off at a saunter then vacillates between torpid and crawl. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding showing some spurts of life in an otherwise two hour downer performance (including an abundance of elevator and monorail rides) that is one of the finest of a good year that unfortunately is in a film that is one of the most trying to endure. Drained of humor as well as depth of field ( shallow LA?)director Spike Jonze continues to underwhelm since his days of being Malkovich. The absurdity had originality, edge, sexiness, humor; 'her' is just one languid disinterested jerk off that asks too much of its audience. Commentary on the times, prognosticator of the future? Perhaps but also a less inspired modern day version of the Wally Cox, Twilight Zone episode that economically tied things together with far more restraints ( time, budget, censorship)than this mopey big budget vision and with far more eloquence working within those constraints. I realize I simplify perhaps by over looking (or getting) the symbolic implications behind this match made in Apple/Microsoft/Verizon?, so I may not be hip? hep? to the jive these days but I'm still capable of suspending disbelief to feel sympathy for movie aberrations ( King Kong, Frankenstein) but at least in these you have a corpus delicti. More close to home you have the similar voice of Mary Tyler Moore In Richard Diamond but at least the gams to go along with it. Accenting Ted's lugubrious journey is some neo-Satie mixed with Walton's theme music and are you ready for this, some original music composed by the self named Sammantha ( more George Winston than Mozart but it's the thought that counts). Ya gotta believe. No thanks.The ambiguous ending ( I miss this too?) gives you pause for thought but by then Ted's been on existential Sominex for two hours at which point 'her' has you game for anything with exit in mind.",3,10,25,10 January 2014
Hacksaw Ridge," Generic War Film, Unorthodox Hero
","Conscientious objector Desmond Doss did not win his Medal of Honor the old fashioned way by wiping out the enemy. Instead he rescued his fellow soldiers as well as give aid and comfort to the enemy by ferrying wounded combatants off of a ridge that included Japanese who one soldier adds sardonically 'did not make it.' In Hacksaw Ridge, director Mel Gibson builds a generic war story around Doss's bravery that seems to celebrate the spectacle of brutality with a slow motion ballet like carnage opening and subsequent excess of bloodletting.Seventh Day Adventist Doss is drafted into the Army but refuses to carry a weapon, volunteering instead to serve as a medic. It does not go over well with his fellow soldiers and he is soon ostracized and brutalized for his principles. He faces court martial when his traumatized alcoholic WW 1 vet dad dons his army issue and miraculously pulls strings to get his son into combat without a gun. He along with his resentful unit soon find themselves in Okinawa staring up at a cliff swarming with enemy.Gibson's direction is heavy handed as it offers up copious amounts of gratuitous violence along with mawkish stateside scenes, especially when dealing with Desmond's old man. Performances for the most part are nondescript with a miscast Vince Vaughn and minor players assuming cliché roles dating back to a Walk in the Sun. Andrew Garfield's Doss is outstanding however bringing both sensitivity and backbone to the role without pose or preachment. Doss's story is a remarkable tale of courage and principle that needed to be told, I just wish it had been presented with less accent on battle scenes and gore to get the war is hell point across in favor of Doss's internalized struggle.",5,6,13,31 January 2017
The Great Gatsby," The Luhrmann Touch displays its crass heavy hand.
","F. Scott Fitzgerald's words continue to stymie filmmaker's attempts to present a decent rendering of his classic 20th century novel The Great Gatsby. The 26 and 49 version gave it little respect while the big budget 74 treatment suffered from the miscasting of long in the tooth Redford and too wispy Mia Farrow as Daisy, though rumored alternatives Ali McGraw and Sibyl Shepherd may have made it even more of a perilous effort. Enter the 2013 failure under the over baked heat and light direction of Boz Luhrmann's wretched excess.Given the same application as his insult to the Belle Epoque in Moulin Rouge Luhrmann slaps on the divine decadence of the Jazz Age at a furious pace while attempting in surreal fashion to remain au courant with an ill fitting hip hop score amid his flashy and noisy compositions populated by wind up flappers under car lot lighting.While the 74 was a disappointment this abrasive lout of a picture is far more of a mess with Luhrmann's response to everything bigger and louder. Even the Valley of Ashes is expanded to the size of Akron. Matching the overall bombast of this carnival (albeit the midway and not a sideshow) are scenery chewing performances led by Len DiCaprio as Gatsby and the rest of the cast following suit with the exception of Tobey Maguire's limp wishy washy Nick Carroway who seems blinded by the light from the outset.Along with Peter Jackson's botched King Kong, Gatsby is another example of Hollywood's passion for eye popping technology at the expense of story telling and human interest. Unfortunately with the failed 50s gimmick of 3-D catching on these days meretricious offerings like this will probably be the rule for years to come.",4,2,6,8 April 2014
