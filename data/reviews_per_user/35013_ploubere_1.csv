Blade Runner 2049," Boring
","It's just not interesting. I got bored about 45 minutes in and stopped watching it; came back a week later to finish it, but it never captured my imagination or moved me in any way. The story goes nowhere, its premise unexplained and unresolved by the end (I suppose to set up the next sequel). Characters are robotic, their motivations unrevealed. It's hard to tell which are replicants and which are human. 
There is some nice cinematography.",4,1,5,30 June 2018
