The Blair Witch Project," An instant great 'horror' film
",This documentary is one of the creepiest films you will ever see.  And it will haunt you.  The film itself is very well done and the ending is one of the best ever.  And finally a horror film of the 1990's that hasn't copied Scream.  A truly great horror film that can be compared to the likes of The Haunting. A must see if you like horror films or suspence thrillers.,9,1,1,18 July 1999
