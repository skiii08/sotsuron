Ford v Ferrari," having speedo in their veins
","Its a marvellous film about crazy speeding car pilots, humungous bright shining cars and cooporate power in the business of car driving, the two main actors give some of their best performances ever. its filmed in an orange glow that is almost surtain a viewer magnet.. the special effects are extremely well embroidered into the action, and the quotes of wisdome are very short and sober.the grumpy old man liked ''herbie'' and some of the other classics from the 70's, but this is even bigger. if you like cars, and speed and motor noise do take my recommendations and have a look, its a marvel",10,3,5,30 December 2019
Scarface," my favourite of all times
","Scarface is the story of an cuban imigrant that transcends into a druglord in the miami area. its cocain to to fingertips, not to say to the nosetips.the violence in this movie are spectacular, and the brute force og al pacinos acting are at a level that never can be copied by anyone. its the corruption, the money, the stuff, the family bonds, its the cartells, its the raw violence, and in the bitter end the profound empathy you feel for the most cruel drug dealer in the end. just dont mess with the shrew, cause youll get shrewed if you.do.the grumpy old man have seen this drug crime classic at least some 30 times, and i hold this as the best film ever made.",10,0,1,27 June 2019
Wind River," well done renner
","I dont know what it is about jeremy renner, but in the role as grave,cold and serious he is born to do it.give him a shot gun and he is even better.well done.
wind river are a great cold and barren movie ,with excellent filmography, inspiring editing,well done acting cast and good musical score.there are some weather issues in the cronology,with bad good bad good weather shift from scene to scene , but its a winter film so its excused.this is a must see film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",8,0,1,13 December 2017
Captain Marvel," frau Capitain Marvel
","Marvel has stumbled back to the tame and lame edition in this film. i know its a build up of an action hero, but how long it took to make her the super power source to protect us all from evil. its just a long waiting story, hoping for some good highflying superfast action to start. though it comes, at about 90 minutes in the movie, but that is far to late. to level it with something from the neolittic scify era, it must be superman one, one long build up, till he learned to fly and undress people with his eyes.its made for the marvel comics nerds, and even though it has its funny moments ,hanging around the mouth of samuel jackson, its not good enough. brie larson, shines like a super model as usual, i like her looks and her acting, but does not deliver either. for me the pace are too slow, the story too complex, the shapeshifters,too lame, and the score too classic(-al), howcome they dont use entirely heavy metal music as a score for this rough and tough lady. the dialouges and presentation tecniques are so stretched and out of date, so i wanda if its the insurance companies guidelines making an impact of this kinda filmaking?the visual and computer made effects are not good, the scene on top of the train are sooo fake, and the flight in space are junk to be modest.the grumpy old man regrets this filmview, and will not recommend it for the lack of action.",3,3,5,28 May 2019
Green Room," rough
","Ive had this film on my watchlist for ages. having seen it its a film full of radical substance on human values and views, its a violent film, but still impressively made violence, there are blood and gore, but thats what you crave for from a film like this, but the plot have some minor flaws to it, but i shall not dwell over that here.its a right wing versus leftwing clashabout, but its not political and wont boost extremism more than other stuff on the silverscreen. its by far a psycological horror thriller of proportions, the technical and visual aspect of the production are rock solid, so do take a look at green room thinks the grumpy old man, its rough and near the limit. its not for minors and fainters of blood and gore.",9,0,2,19 October 2019
Us," what is wrong with them
","I did look forward to see this film, but what a joke of a movie, it is horrorless as ''it comes at night'', and as stupid as ''suspiria'', its the upmost and extreme example of selfindulgence to write something as lame as this. its just weird and unfortunately leaves me with a whole lot of questions,why,why,why?so why 2 instead of one, well there are some good acting inbetween, especially facial mimic as the ball sized eyes of horror when the scare came.the grumpy old man does not recommend it at all....",2,2,3,22 May 2019
Aquaman," extreme,near biblicaly apocalyptic experience...
","Though the story are very marvel like...its all about a visual orgasmic cascade of vfx and cgi-effects, that bombards the optic nerve to a near apoplectic experience of motion,color and sound. its definately the very very best marvel/dc comic film i have seen,and really challenges avatar when it comes to visuall impression. i saw the film in 2d at the theater,and i donot regret that, what i really regret is that i did not do an extra effort to find a 3d screening,do that if you can....the acting though are average, but the fights and acton shoots are spectacular,and may the force be with you.....star wars really looses terrain compared to what aquaman presents.if youre a nerd you may not like all the breeches of physical laws that are broken when living a submarine life, and the moralistic standpoint taken on the polution of the ocean are daft and nevertheless-like.i have given a 10 in a mood of hysteria of this film experience, and even give a plus to the tenner for the ironical comments and comedy that are stuck inbetween. i also sensed this from other spectators when leaving the theater. so if you must choose between bumble bee and aquaman for your christmas giftcard cinema experience ,then go for aquaman,you will never forget it,and you wont regret it anyhow. im going to see this film many times at 0.5 and 0,25 speed just to swallow all the background and background movements. it is pivotal an d majesticly done.",10,2,6,31 December 2018
American Sniper," marvellous, fantastic.......
","this film is a jewel in the sense of light,view,sound and intensity .an emerald of direction, and a blood diamond of editing(cutting edge sharp). the love story are a bit narrow but cute,the story telling are OK,but i think the technical management behind this movie are very impressing. i will say ,after having seen a few of Eastwoods latest productions that he is leveling Scorsese and Spielberg in magnificence and immersion. Also impressed of Bradley Coopers acting in this film,his physical performance and appearance were amazing. praise those who can make ice cold hot shooting and breathtaking war movies like this",10,15,21,12 November 2017
LÃ©on: The Professional," besson and reno at its best?
","an entertaining but also grave ,destructive,shocking and some gut wrenching shoots makes this film well worth to see. well acted performances by Reno and Portman,and some sting of hilariously funny shots of Gary Oldman,gave me some quick laughs. the pace in this movie could've been better,cause there are some very slow moments,but the telling is good,some may say its a bad script,but this film doesn't need more.the actors told the untold story with excellence definitely an 8,and goes on to my top 150 list.",8,2,3,5 November 2017
Bird Box," main stream
","If you like virus movies,mass psychosis movies,it come at night movies and all the rest of tomorrow never comes movies,then you should make a blind date with this film.
it has some tense moments and very strict rules a paths to follow, but it is not the kind of film i like. i like sandra so thats why i saw it.she and some of the cast are doing a great job, but there are as usual too much jabbing about,so it gets what the germans say ''langweillig''. i just dont understand why they couldnt use polaroid sunglasses,or sun screenfoil on a divers mask just to reflect the develish vibes of sinisterism....
what makes this blindroad to succes come through are the awsome filmography,and scenic views.
the moral is to listen to what the blind man says,or become blind yourself,then you might survive this ordeal. its barely recommendable",6,7,28,16 December 2018
The Thing," this'll never grow old
","The thing of 1982 is a marvel at the sci-fi/horror front. i grew up with this thing and used it to scare the guts out of my younger buddies at the videogettogethers we had from time to time.
its an antarctic based story, where strange things starts to happen at a norwegian science station. the americans at the neighbour site fly over to see whats going on, and are gobsmacked to see what has happened to the camp, all ruins,and noone alive. flying back telling the story,strange things starts to happen there too. and well its the thing......if you havent seen or dared to see this classic, the grumpy old man recommends this as one of the best horror movies of the 80's",10,3,5,27 June 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," its too impressive
","I give this film a 9 because its enduring and keeps your attention from beginning to end, what i find as a drawback are the lysergic acid diethylamide- like spiderverse, that hits your retina with colours and bubbles and beams of lightning and flashing stars, just like the one you used to get when pressing your knuckles against your eyeapples as a child, that made you ask the question,''is this how my brain looks like on the inside?''. to an old grupy man with an unadjusted farsightedness,it becomes a bit too much.its recommended though.",9,2,5,25 February 2019
Climax," get engulfed by the madness
","Climax is one of the film i wish i had turned of, because it draws you through the wide spectre of human emotions. there are no coherence in what you see and may expect. its light ,its music,its hysteria,its madness,its dance,its movements, its noise ,its grief, it sucks you in by mesmerizing dancing, then youre turmoiled in the washing machine, then trown in the drier, and thereafter youre squezed trough the clothing roller, and you come out clean and plain , promising never to use LSD once again......its a french production, and french is kauderwelsh to me, so i feel like missing out some of the nuances that languageunderstanding gives.what really lured me in was the extreme dancing parts, especially the ensemble set up in the start of the film. i think i will replay that 6 minute section again and again just to analyse and to absorbe every movement done by the actors, because you get tunnelvision when watching it ,drawing the attention to the centerpart of the screen.at this point the film is worth 100 stars.but from there it starts to implode and end up with 6 stars as my final rating. i may insult those who admire ''a clockwork orange'', but '' climax'' is a film that makes the same level of sense , its senseless and weird. i will recommend it for its first half, because it made the grumpy old man dance on the sofa......",6,1,2,7 February 2019
The Favourite," weird but good
","I did expect more from a film having had so many academy nominations. the acting are good and the story are filled with witt and irony to the fingertips.
what i didnt like were the profound use af light and dark, actually so dark visuals so that i had difficulties watching and listening(''who said that,to who-hoo''?). i wish id seen it with subtitles that are like the rossetta stone to the one who hasnt got english as birthlanguage.the technical product,locations and settings, costume-makeup and artdesing are explicittly well done.
not to forget is the score, that are mostly beautiful, but at times enervingly irritating, like a heartbeat of madness....though the flaws and angle of storytelling its highly watchable and for sure recommended by the grumpy old man and his wife.",7,2,3,6 March 2019
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," the best of splatter horror comedy ive seen
","I wont be long, just saying that this is a flickr for the liquer among us, a terrific set of inglorious rednecks having their reputation branded as psychokillers, while the branders goes completely amock in a havock of blood and spatter, and guts and bile are extracted from every human made bodily openings.most of all its a paradoxial parody on the splatter horror genre, add to that a big lump of hardwood comedy, and a brushcutters intensity youll be hit by the spear of madness, and headless , but ever so good caracter acting. its a must see for all of us who grew up with late 70's and 1980's horror. this was an umbilical surprise for the twinheaded grumpy old man, and its a big recommend.",9,0,0,23 April 2020
2012," why are overexegerating sooo bad?
","Thats why i like this film, its overexagerated from start to end, and that entertains me, i feel more in touch with mother earth when watching 2012,than when looking at superhero flicks or lord of the rings,or even avatar,that are all drown by use of special effects.
only b ruce almighty would know how dull all these movies would have been without it..its fascinating and groundbreaking stuff made by roland emerich.
the acting are on average,the story are dry and thin, but the score and the effects are impecable. so lets float into year one,or 9 as it is when i write this,with the promise that i will see this film for the 10th time next year. i love it",10,5,9,23 November 2018
The Adjustment Bureau," a pretty decent movie
","Its the second time i watch this, and i love the way matt damon conquers the silverscreen , ever again. its a film about serendipity, or how serendipitous life can be, and how different your life couldve been if you had chosen a different path of life, choice of education, friends,hobbies,job etc.i have many a time been dwelling about my own destiny,and its serendipitous moments in life, especially on how i met and found the girl who became my girlfriend and who are today my wife and mother to our 3 children, i can with my hand on my heart declare, at better or for worse that this was a blinge or glitch from the adjustment bureau, or what i call serendipity. how it all happened i will maybe tell some other time, but i still get the goosebumps i had the whenever i recall thet time of life.review, well yes, its a solid handwork of a movie, with beautiful settings and mindbending twists that kept me hanging on, but , and thats ther reason i give a nine, it is so darn slow paced in periods, that it made my wife fall asleep, and that maybe a reason that the overall amount of stars are as low as they are, 20 minutes shorter would hjave saved alot.i just have to make a note on the score of this film, its the kind that youll barely reckognize, because its there and its beautiful in its environment and therefore not spectacular, but it carries the film on 18 wheels and the film wouldnt have been anything without it.the grumpy old man can just close this book by saying thank you matt, ill look forward to the next movie of yours to come, and why the heck aint you going for the presidency yourself.???",9,0,2,27 April 2019
Uri: The Surgical Strike," jay hindi........
","Well, this was a roller coaster ride between drama and action, spiced up with a lofentanil-induced patriotism that i havent seen on film since the cold war between east and west in the 70's a 80's. also the presentation of the pakistanis as the stupid neighbour both in the dialouges and action, really hits the bullseye of ultra-indian patriotism.but the action sequences of the film are blockbuster worthy, though the pyrotechnicians and bomb makers seems more interested in fireworks than what happens when a bullitt hits different material. we are also overloaded with info about where and when that flashes on the screen more than nescesarry.the score makes suspence to the action, but damages the drama, there are also some strange intermissions made by the editor that raised my eyebrows more than once.but in the end it delivers what the indian people wants, and thereby puts another kettle on the stove to boil up even more negativism about pakistan and the feud over khasmir. why they fight over this area, are not for making more lebensraum, i guess its because of the water resources stored in the khasmir mountains that has made this mess, including a bit religous differences and so on.well worth a look, but dont expect too much, the grumpy old man thinks",7,0,2,20 March 2019
Logan," the most violent film of 2017????????
","I feel a bit sick,delving over the film logan.logan spelt backwards are nagol,which is a tribal ritual,where young boys are made into men,by diving from 60-90 feet wooden towers,with only a liana atatched to the legs.....and i feel like i've done that just now.adrenalin on overdrive,a bit sick in my stomach,wondering....was this really necesarry.....i mean...they are after all x-men....there must be some lack of intelligence somewhere between here and there.in the early 1980's there were films that were banned for too much violence, e-g ''class of 1984'',''city of the living dead'' etc etc,wich scared the living daykights out of me,and have marked me for the rest of my life.i wonder what youngsters gain out of this film....terrible-terrible...............i wonder...how much have been banned out of loganhaving said this,after viewing and rated 1200 films(oand further thousands more),i have given the rating of 8.
why... well it is a marvelously made fimographic,audiographic and well edited product,with excellent cgi and vfx-work,marvellous visualls,and a very impressing piece of acting made by hugh jackman,thank the over-x (lord)for that.
i love the choice of locations wich gave the film some touch of sanity and reality.",8,1,5,14 January 2018
Hotel Mumbai," raw and full of realism
","One of those films that will fill you with sadness, so meaningless for most of us, and a signal of desperadoism from the rest.acting are at times extremely good, the bandits raw and extremely cold activities are cruelly well done. the sound effect department has done an brilliant job, the sound of shooting and boms were just petrifying.a film to watch if your in good shape, history nerd and can accept a glitch of absence of bollywood dance ensemble numbers. the playtime maybe long , but all in all the grumpy old man recommends a watch.",9,12,31,5 June 2019
Once Upon a Time in America," a superlong mobcrimedrama
","That goes faster and faster for each time i view it, so it might be some sense in the saying that time flies faster when you become older. its in fact so long and full of hidden loopholes that turns up like a gopher, did i see this last time?-feeling.its almost or close upto the godfather films of content and quality, and i remember when young , we had video egettogethers on saturdays, and i was the only one staring wide eyed at 4 a.m. in the morning the rest of my buddies long gone into neverland.so it made a deep impression to then,and still do today.for the young generations of today i guess they will sense this crimedrama as a new production, because the filmography,the score and the locationgallery are so darn timeless and the acting astonisjing. the only actor i miss in this film is al pacino, the mobster king above all.the grumpy old man has this on his top 20 list, and if you disagree,then do repeat the pain and review the flick another time, its the best of the longest....",10,1,10,27 June 2019
"McFarland, USA"," run to the hills and far away
","Gary moore once sang in a song from the 80's, did they find their inspiration from that or from run to the hills of iron maiden? anyway its a sports movie, a film about growing patiently from nothing to win it all. its not a funny movie, but like all american sprts flicks it happens to have a winner in the end, and its a darn happy ending too...as a filmproduct it follows all the moviemakers cliches that could be found whenever they are making a sports movie. what drags this film down on my scale of starawards is the unbelievable slow pace on the development of this movie. its like the director have said ''all you need to do is run'' to the actors, and may you thirst to death in the baking summer sun in central californian desert. there are not much finesse nor fantasy behind this victory, just running and that is just like forrest gump, at the end of his criss cross country running coming to a halt, ''i wanna go home'' and that really lingered my mind several times.the grumpy old man loves movies where the underdog wins, this was allreit and nothing more than that",6,1,2,3 August 2019
Titanic," the ultimate lovestory
","Titanic is the film ive viewed 2nd most of all, i am the kinda guy that can watche a good movie once every 2 to 3 months, and ive seen titanic some 25-30 times and i should know the storyline pretty well.when seeing this in the theater first time alone and the next night with my wife i was lost for words each time. my wife cried the whole night and well into the next night of this lovestory, and whenever i put this in the video, i know ill have the tv space for myself, cause she made a promise to never ever let herself into a mental state again as when watching it the first time.its not so much the act that does this film, its far too cliched' to become a marvel of acting, but its the heart and the cruelty of life and death that crushes my heart each time i see it. the last 15 minutes are the worst, and i usually stop when the flag goes below the surface of the ocean..the grumpy old man might be a cry-baby, but its worth it, the second highest on my ever best movie list",10,5,6,27 June 2019
American Made," chaotic fun
","Very good show of roller-coaster riding aviation and muffin puffin drug humour.especially one scene with tom cruise running along with a cloud of ''flee powder'' are extremely fun. i like the sound and light settings in this movie.very nice choice of music,though a little bit chaotic and shallow script to follow. it is a hasty lesson of American hidden ''red fear'' policy era, so i feel that the basic knowledge of the real history is beneficiary to enjoy this movie..too much money to hide to make it a 10'er. this is a likable edition of tom cruise,and the movie are within the range of my top 250 movies",8,4,9,15 October 2017
Joker," not sensational
","Its the untold story of gothams dear joker, lets call it the rise of the joker, that sounds better.for the acting by joachin phonix i give a star spangling 9, for the rest of the movie just a 6. its a slow movie, very slow paced, that rides on a junior wave, till the killerwave comes rumbling, in the most psychopatic way you can imagine. si i got what i expected, and a sequel will arise from the ashes of blood. just wonder how the clown train came in as it was ordered, serendipity or five flies in one whack.the grumpy old man have seen stories far better told, and by far much better plotted, but if youre in for it youll get satisfie will recommend for the acting.",7,1,10,10 November 2019
The Green Mile," timeless
","Its a stephen king novel. that says some, but its also a tom hanks movie, and that says alot, not that he does that great a performance, its the whole cast that really makes this film an unforgettable fabel of vast proportions.this ilm has ita all, cruelty, hate,love,mystery,secrets,miracles and a little bit of heaven breathing above it all. ive seen this feature film 1+-11 times, at least, and hold this one as my favourite mystery movie of all times. the wise man once said, why must always humans kill the best of the best humans?? i do have some religious translations ringing in my mind when i see this film, how come jesus got killed by his fellow humans, why did he have to die to withhold all human sin.... i'm not religious, so why delve over it...anyway, its a gripping movie, where even the worst of humans becomes empathised, and the real cruels are dehuminised.the grumpy old man has this on his top 10 allover genre list. enjoy the green mile, the last stretch towards the gates of heaven.",10,0,1,27 June 2019
Lord of War," extrem at its best
","Its a 2005 movie, maybe at nicholas cage peak of best, and he reallt delivers a top notch entertaining act in this weapon dealing thriller. i would compare it to scarface on the basics of crimes against humanity, and the the motto''the world is yours''.the first 75 minutes are just an ecstasy of brilliant filmmaking, then it unfortunately descends into a bore of realities. but for its generations of filmatic era its tells a brute story about weapon oile, diamonds and money in a brilliant matterwant to join the armistice of a cruel man, then mthe grumpy old man recommends",9,0,0,27 June 2019
Parasite," its not a new idea
","But its an amazing movie to follow from start to end. it has humour, sorrow, genial twists and lures, marvellous acting from the entire cast. the filmography is a marvel itself, and should be seen even though you might not like south korean film.the transitions between scenes are what i call supersmooth, and very well spiced musical score, that makes you relax as well as take your breath away of shock jolts that appears from nowhere.its a comedy satire, with a whole lot of wishing well realism, a quick look at south korean sosciety, the extreme contrasts , and the serendipidness of life that makes a grumpy old man impressed. its a top notch flick and its highly recommended.",10,26,50,10 August 2019
The Greatest Showman," superb
","When i tell you that i usually hate musicals,then read this:
this is an orgasm of song ,sound,acting,light,visuall enchantment,love,sorrow,family,fellowship,slendid choreography,dancing,, show,music,crying , laughing,advanced filmography,and sharp editing.
a feel of ''moulin rouge'' ,buts its a lot more happier..if you miss this,you will be the siss.
its the best showmovie in decades,believe me.",10,2,5,20 March 2018
Midway," its a roller coaster
","And remember the yorktown who fell to save the rest....its a roller coaster of action and wargames, i praise the use of special effects, just some lame action and lame explosion effects from the attack on pearl harbour makes some drawback, they could have made a better effort here.also the stereotypical presentation of japanese officers, and the patriotic, head down first , crying out loud emotional presentation of the american officers and pilots tastes cheesy and utterly sweet at times.but having seen it on the big and the small screen it passes the scrutinous eyes of the grumpy old man well, and it will be hard to match in the future. its a 9 with a great recommend",9,1,1,13 January 2020
Green Book," wonderful

Annihilation," unique,and well managed
","Its a cross over of alien,,the thing and it comes at night.
it is a very slow film,almost to slow,nearly tyering,but there are something lurking behind,and gives it the dimension of fear and annihilation.around the next corner.
no spectacular oscar winning acting,but the use of color and visual effects are triggering marvellous.the musical component are fundamental in this kinda films and ''it follows''.you
the guitar played,are plain and simple and gives life and consolation in a rather fearful and alien environment.
allinall,wellmade,a bit horrish,could havebeen a bit more action,but it is a ''femmes ''psycological horror troller after all. better than it comes at night.a 7 from me",7,3,7,13 March 2018
