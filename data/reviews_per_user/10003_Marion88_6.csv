Changeling," Good vs Evil tale for bigots
","MAY CONTENT SPOILERS What is Clint Eastwood's problem? Is the aging Pale Rider getting afraid of Death? Has he not found anything else than religious bigotry to cure his fears? Because that is what Changeling is about. A series of caricatured characters straight out of a Sunday morning sermon, in a story told with absolutely no humor, no irony - always a bad sign - on a pompous solemn TV evangelist tone. Be afraid of going to hell! Be afraid of sitting in front of 132 minutes of a sermonizing movie about good and evil. Add to this: clichés galore, a slow pace (you can go out and buy a drink, being comfortable you are not missing anything), plain camera work and picture compositions, and a very unconvincing performance from A. Jolie. Everything she does is unbelievable. When she takes her child in her arms it looks fake. Her feelings which may be genuine just don't come through. To her credit she has nothing to play: the character is the embodiment of virtue. She's good, good, good, so good, so dull, she should have asked for a rewrite. Only upside to her character: she works on roller skates for a telephone company, which may have sound cool on paper and is simply odd in the movie. Quite unlike her, a series of evil freaks badly try to harm the Virgin Mary who's lost her child. The corrupt cop, excellent performance by Jeffrey Donovan, a baddie who should get more parts, the corrupt and pervert psychiatrist (what else), and of course the formulaic serial killer who just walked out of an episode of CSI, except this time, the TV series plot is served with a sermon, as he finds true redemption owing to a last minute confession to a priest. The content of the confession most certainly holds the secret to the whole plot but nor us nor Mrs Jolie get to know it. The good mother is helped by another good character in her fight against the three baddies and guess what's his job: he's a reverend. Malkovitch looks so evil naturally that he manages to create an interesting character out of another dull part of the screenplay. He's a genius actor this man, Hollywood tends to forget his huge talent too much too fast. You end up wishing the film was about the reverend rather than his simpering protégé. Most of the time the plot is grossly unbelievable. The mother is manipulated by the press to accept a child which is clearly not hers; What made the real mother do it in the real life, who knows; but the film fails to properly account for this keystone to the story. The good reverend walks in the hospital with a warrant to save the good mother from the evil psychiatrist just as she is about to receive electric shocks, just like in a pulp B movie, except this one thinks very highly of itself. I mean come on, this can't be serious, what were they thinking? 2 out of 10 for the recreation of the 1930s LA costumes, props and visual effects.",Null,19,38,22 December 2008
The New World," Cast lacks charisma for a true epic
","Past the marvels of the opening shots, one must admit that the performance of Farrell is the core of the failure of this movie. The storyline is predictable until it ends abruptly, thanks to the new cut I guess, the dialogs are scarce which certainly does not help the actors, but in Farrell's case... maybe it does. The director did not manage to pull a hero out of him, nor a anti hero, nor a baddie, nothing but a dull performance. The music is nice but repetitive, 2 pieces are looped and played over and over again for over 2 hours. The settings are nice but do not vary except for a welcome trip to England which deserved a less superficial treatment. Come on. Pocahontas visits the Queen. This should have been a mythical sequence. It's hardly on screen. The desperation of the settlers deserved to be explored a bit more, to make them interesting rather than plain bad guys saying they are hungry. That is how deep the movie goes...",Null,0,4,2 April 2007
The Other Boleyn Girl," Flawed script and directing
","Regardless of historical accuracy, of faithfulness to the novel the Other Boleyn Girl is a bad film. The screenplay is a succession of scenes with very little purpose until the second half of the film. Even then it fails to create a sense of intimacy with the characters, a series of monsters in their own right for which the viewer does not care. Even the good sister is depicted as too stupid and obedient to be worth any sympathy. After all her sister has done to her she still loves her; whatever monstrosity her daddy or uncle asks her to perform she does it with a nod and smile. So she can't be the right point of view to tell the story and she is not. The main problem of this bad screenplay is indeed that it is not told from any body's point of view. The POV is outside. So is the spectator. Outside the theater quick. Fresh air. Relief. Now when it comes to directing, the director manages to make three of the most handsome actors and actresses in Hollywood today look plain, vulgar and tired. Almost every shot has the wrong POV. The camera moves are repetitive. Filming through a grid, a fence, whatever he can find is a repetitive pattern of photography. Horrible color timing. One scene is green, the other is dark, the other red, without any apparent logic. Lighting is crude, plain, TV-like most of the time, and all of a sudden falsely sophisticated for a minute without a reason. The castles feel empty and dead. You feel it's a movie set all the time. Costumes: ugly, taking all the appeal away from the actresses. A Majority of BBC TV period dramas look better than this film. Deserved to flop at the box despite its ultra glamorous cast and a very interesting story to begin with. A complete waste.",Null,2,4,2 May 2008
Quantum of Solace," Lack of talent may destroy world cinema greatest franchise
","When a formulaic screenplay meets a talentless director the greatest franchise in film history is in serious danger. No imagination, predictable scenes, repetitive action scenes shot clumsily by a director who cannot seem to give his actors any direction - as a result the actors speak their lines like priests at a funeral - A feeling of confusion, a big headache due to inelegant speedy editing of shaky close up shots. The director edits 15 close ups back to back and the spectator loses all sense of location and action scenes become tedious. What may seem cool on on a small avid monitor turns out to be a disaster on a big screen. Well what about the usually beautiful inventive opening credits sequences? Dull ugly graphics which may have seemed cool 20 years ago although I doubt it. Definitely not at par with the rest of the Bonds, including the previous Craig Bond movie which seems a masterpiece in comparison with this Quantum of Disaster. First time in my life I see people walk out the theater during a Bond movie. All feeling sorry and ashamed for Bond.",Null,7,10,9 November 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Another empty Weinstein marketing coup, a truly depressing movie
","Why is everyone ecstatic about this B karate/gore movie? I have tried to watch it several times and I have never been able to watch more than 20 minutes of it each time. No dialogs, a cigarette thin plot, gratuitous B violence, pompous artsy fartsy camera angles completely meaningless... Well, they actually serve a purpose for the director who keeps reminding the audience: 'look guys where I put the camera, I'm a genius, see, admire me!'. As a matter of fact if it wasn't for the weird camera angles this would be a pretty plain bad film instead of a pompous bad film. Filming dialog from the top of a tree or from underneath the soles of the actors' shoes is nothing to get excited about. This is not what cinema is about. This is advertising making. This is a film for brainwashed TV addicts who confuse ad making and film making. A very depressing film experience, I refuse to endorse just because so many ignorants got thrilled by it, just because they have never seen anything worthy before. Another pathetic Miramax contribution to the history of cinema. The Weinstein Brothers are the kings of marketing. Thank God history won't remember the Weinstein Brothers.",Null,5,9,26 August 2005
Avatar," Pure cheese
","**** CONTAINS SPOILERS******* I'd like my 3D with less cheese please Mr Cameron! I walked out of the theater with the same bitter feeling as when I saw the Star Wars prequel whatever it was called the Phantom something. The feeling of having witnessed a complete failure I wanted so badly to enjoy. It all starts with that cheesy voice over. Usually a bad sign, but I was crossing my fingers the guy is a maestro, a genius, a pure talent, after all I heard in the media. 20 minutes of miserable acting and unbelievably lame lines that belong to a B TV series later, I start doubting the reviews. Characters who are supposed to have been living together for months start explaining to each other why they are here, who they are etc... in a very contrived and unsophisticated way that make it all very laughable. The hero is played by a bloke who belongs to an afternoon TV series, and is described as a stupid marine. Impossible to even start liking him. I started asking myself whether the genius had made a comedy. But no, the rest of the picture was undoubtedly first degree cheese. We were not supposed to laugh. Then this big animal a giant black alien panther with 6 legs comes out of the jungle for a chase, I cheer up: the masterpiece starts here! A cool chase in the woods, our hero is separated from his patrol without means of communication and runs for his life in the jungle. His patrol leaves him behind. There is nothing they can do. The hero miraculously escapes by jumping in a waterfall. You'd think that his fellow soldiers would deem him dead after leaving him alone to deal with a giant panther in the middle of a an unknown jungle. No. The officer as if he had seen the movie fears: 'he won't make it through the night'. That's when I started thinking that there was something deeply rotten in Avatar: the script. It feels it has been written in a rush or by a talentless beginner, or someone whose power in the project was such that nobody would dare tell him the blinding truth: if you are over 12 years old, you cannot believe one minute of Avatar because it's too cheesy. The script is not at par with the budget, nor the CGI . The fact that it makes so much money at the box will certainly make the author(s) brush any criticism away. Regardless of the box, avatar is a scandal of a script. Then the rest of the movie is just a confirmation that what makes a bad movie is a bad story. It becomes an endless retelling of Dances with wolves, itself a cheesy retelling of Little big man etc. As usual it needs a white man to tell the Indians how to fight back, they're too under-developed, naive and primitive you see. With a few differences: the Indians are now the color the soldiers of the cavalry used to be, ie blue, they have rastafari dreadlocks, cats eyes and mouse ears and they are saved not only by Kevin Costner but also by the buffalos this time. The Buffalos join forces as they have learned their lesson: they understand what Buffalo Bill will do to them later on if they don't do anything. Many similarities still with your usual John Wayne western: the horses, the broncos they tame, the arrows the costumes and the squaws. But no Wayne. No actors at all. Our tasteless hero is accepted by the Indians, God only knows why, no explanation is given, except their sheer stupidity and he is taught how to become an Indian himself through a 30 minutes montage of boring sequences with no dramatic tension whatsoever. The rest is the usual celebration of testosterone and violence, the usual Hollywood dubious self-defense violence you find in any action movies except this one is lecturing us on its anti violence anti war stance. It still exploits an hour of pure violence to make money. End of story: the usual showdown between our dummy boy hero and the baddie, a ridiculous body builder GI Joe. A movie is as good as its baddie, Disney used to say . Well look at the baddie here: you'll know how bad Avatar is. The hero saves the Indians who without him would be toast, they're so crass and stupid, those 'savages', a stupid marine makes all the difference. I watched all this mess with a pair of heavy 3D glasses which darken the picture and leave a mark on your nose so everybody you meet within the next two hours ask you whether you've just seen avatar, it's so red in the middle of your face. They say it's 21st century cinema. It may well be, but when the novelty of the technique wears off, they'd better start hiring scriptwriters. I am not going back any time soon. I don't care about the 3D, I want to see a good movie please! The quality of the dialogs and the fun of the Ice Age or Nemo make those cartoons enjoyable for all. Avatar is only for kids who enjoy violent video games and do not care for any story or characters. I heard people say Avatar is beautiful. Avatar's conception of beauty is 'when it glows in the dark'. Like stars you stick on kids bedrooms ceilings. I'm way too old for fluorescent deco. There is good news in Avatar's box office: it is probably scaring the hell out of LA talent agencies who got used to making millions off star power. People seem happy with 3D without cast. It may be the only 21st century news in the picture.",Null,21,50,1 January 2010
