The Blair Witch Project," You will either love this movie or hate it
","*SPOILER WARNING*
Personally, I loved The Blair Witch Project. I had been waiting in anitcipation for it ever since I saw a preview back in April. I was happy to see that I wasn't disappointed. Rather than rely on expensive and cheesy specail effects a'la The Haunting, The Blair Witch Project used the views own imagination to scare you.You NEVER know what is out in those woods making those sounds, which I think is much scarier than an actor in bad make-up. Of course, if you have a poor imagination, this concept is kind of lost on you :) .  I loved the freakish sounds the characters heard at night, as well as the bizarre discoveries during the day. But once Josh disappears, it really picks up. When Heather finds the body part in the bundle of sticks and the final shot......brrrrrrrrrrr......freaky, scary stuff. It was like an old campfire story that was filmed. My one copmplaint was that there was too much day footage and not enough night stuff. I liked watching the slow breakdown of the characters, but I would have much rather have scene more of the creepy night sounds and maybe even a glimpse of a shadowy figure or something. As much as I loved this movie, I can understand why people may hate it. It was INCREDIBLY over-hyped by the Internet and the media. Hype will kill anything good OR bad. As well, the first hour is rather uneventful (but NOT boring). Not to offend anyone, but I believe this is a 'smart person' horror movie. If you have a good imagination, and a grip on what horror is, and are not expecting special effects you will love The Blair Witch Project. Just sit back, and try and put ypourself in Heather's shoes and I htink you will really enjoy it. But go in with an open mind and expect soemthing totally different. Side note, that one scene with Heather making the apologies was awesome! The terror in her eyes...especially when she heard that sound...the defining moment in the film!By the way, don't sit in the first few rows. I had to leave the theatre in the middle of the movie because I thought I was going to puke! The jiggly camera effects made me sea sick!",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worth the wait
","Great movie! It was well worth the wait. The story...the characters...the special effects made it all worth while. Although the basic storyline is a little convoluted, it was still a good set-up to the rest of the series. The only real problem I had was with Jar Jar Binks. He was REALLY annoying, and was often hard to understand whenever he spoke. Overall, I give this movie an 8. I think the upcoming episodes will be even better!",8,0,0,22 May 1999
