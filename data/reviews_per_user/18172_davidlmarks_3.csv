United 93," United 93-- the closest thing to the real thing
","I saw this film the day it came out with a friend of mine. I, like most of you, remember when and where I was on Sept 11, 2001. My life has never been the same.I watched this film, enraptured by it's third party view of the events (even though, of course, these people in the plane tower, like us, were captivated by the real-life events unfolding in front of them). This event, like everyone in this film (yes, many of the people playing roles in this film were the actual people who worked the tower that day-- including the lead role)!I watched in silence beside my friend.And when it ended, there was only silence, except for a girl crying further down in the audience.Yeah. My life was changed on 9/11. This film has come the closest to capturing that horrendous day.",10,4,8,15 July 2012
Train to Busan," One hell of a train ride!!!
","Wow.Where do I even begin? This movie shows that Hollywood does not own the monopoly on quality film making. But checking out the quality of the entertainment of late coming from Hollywood, that's not really a stretch.All young Su-an (played by Soo-an Kim) wants for her birthday is to spend it with her mother. So her separated and unengaged father Seok Woo (played by Yoo Gong) attempts to fulfill her wish. Her mother lives in Busan. That's a relatively unconventional short train ride, and with some coaxing, off they go.But, of course, the train ride is anything but unconventional.News filters into passengers on the train that something horrible is affecting people, turning them into crazed rabid flash eaters. Little do they know that this is about to infect the people on the train as well.Along with Seok Woo and Su-an, there are a whole host of great secondary characters that round out the cast. Like cheerleader Ahn So-hee, reluctant boyfriend and amateur baseball player Young Gook (and the rest of the team), Sang Hwa, a linebacker or sumo wrestler or just a plain bad-ass, and his expectant wife Sung Gyeong. Do NOT mess with this man's wife and child! The train is a perfect setting for a zombie apocalypse showdown. The train can not stop at stations because they are all over-run by the hordes, and the living passengers are continually being squeezed into tighter and tighter quarters by the increasing number of swarming undead that move like World War Z zombies-on-meth.Train to Busan is one of the best zombie action flicks I've seen in a long time. Director Sang-ho Yeon does an amazing job with pacing, the acting is top notch, and the screenplay (also written by Sang-ho Yeon) is visceral and touching.Highly highly recommend!",10,10,25,27 October 2016
The Cabin in the Woods," 'The Cabin in the Woods (2011)' -- not your average Zombie Movie -- A Review!
","'The Cabin in the Woods (2011)' is definitely not your average zombie movie. It's not even your average horror or sci-fi movie.How to describe it? It's like 'The Evil Dead' meets 'Night of the Living Dead' meets 'The Immortals...' meets 'The Truman Show.' 5 young folks suit up in their best summer-wear, hop in buddy's dad's RV, and head out to a cousin's cabin... in the woods.All of the prerequisite character types are included: the Jock, the Braniac, the Stoner, the Sexy (just turned) Blonde and of course, the Virgin.These roles become more and more stereotypical as the movie continues-- but that in no way detracts from this being one of the most creative, well scripted; at times hilarious, and at other times horrifying films I've seen in years-- and it's not just because it has zombies. Actually it has a whole 'redneck torture family of zombies'... who use weapons! Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford are absolutely fantastic in their roles -- a little jaded about their work, going through the motions-- but, eh... it's a living. Anybody notice the 'rookie' (shall we call him the summer intern) was named Truman. Coincidence? I think NOT! All of the kids are more than respectable as terrified late-teenagers, especially Fran Kranz as Marty, the constantly stoned wise-cracker. It's his stoner mind that starts to actually put things together-- except, is this sh*t really happening or is he just stoned? Marty Marty Marty.This was one of Fran's first movies-- and I predict we will see a lot more of him.There are more twists and bizarre turns than a really warped Penrose Stairscase! If you think you've got it all figured out, just keep watching. About every ten minutes you'll change your mind. And in the final climactic scene, there is such a smörgåsbord of violence and chaos that I wanted to stand up and cheer! Joss Whedon's quippy dialogue is a pleasure! Highly recommended!",10,1,4,25 January 2013
