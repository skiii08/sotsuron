3:10 to Yuma," Mind numbing in its stupidity
","There is no reason for this entire movie. Other than the acting, which was good, this movie is a total waste. The story has too many flaws and holes in it. 3:10 to Yuma is every bit as uninteresting as The Assassination of Jesse James. It's overwrought, loaded down with the same thing over and over -- long periods of tough talk, followed by shooting their way out of an impossible situation. Then more chatter followed by another implausible escape from death. It has all the cartoonishness of an Indiana Jones movie. If they had just shot Russell Crowe when he first gets arrested, the director could have called it a day and saved us all 2 hours.",1,31,56,17 August 2008
A Star Is Born," Would not recommend this to anyone
","It is a muddled, mediocre, hot mess. I find it hard to believe it was nominated for so many awards, and find it incredulous that it has won any awards!! I had read where this version was not like any of the previous versions -- but guess what folks - that's a lie. This is the same rehashed story as the other remakes. And this story it isn't all that interesting to anyone outside of the entertainment industry.My biggest complaint is the editing - this could have been tightened up a lot and perhaps someone could have written some interesting scenes.As far as acting -- Gaga did a credible job. Certainly better than Bradley Cooper.The music is atonal, melancholy and without imagination. All the songs are like listening to someone whine in a monotone.",2,4,6,4 March 2019
Brokeback Mountain," Why do people think this is a love story?? It's absurdly off the mark.
","The passage of time has not helped this movie. It's a horrible script that is held together with some decent acting. But my God - this is a hot mess of a movie. If this was filmed in an adult bookstore, it would make more sense -- but why are we trying to pretend this is a love story? They aren't making love -- they having a quick shag and one of them doesn't want to be around the other afterwards. I hear straight women carrying on about how this is wonderful love story and so romantic. It makes me wonder what their marriages must be like.",1,9,34,8 January 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Totally entertaining
","It may not be historically accurate - no film is. What this is, however, is entertaining. Compare this to A Star Is Born - and there is no comparison. Rhapsody entertains - A Star Is Born does not.",10,1,1,4 March 2019
Man of Steel," Like watching a bad video game for 2 hours
","Absolutely hated this. Some parts of the story line were pretty good, but the special effects and battle scenes were incredibly amateurish and over done. Years ago, I had a game called Rock 'em, Sock 'em Robots. This movie reminded me of that game. On and on, and just when you think it's over, there's more of the same. Just badly done special effects, trying to paper over the lack of any real substance. Especially bad is the tornado scene. In 1939, they depicted a tornado better in the Wizard of Oz than they did in this movie. As for the acting -- this movie doesn't require great acting. I thought everyone handled their parts fairly well. And Henry Cavill did a reasonably good job. He certainly has the looks. But, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",2,3,6,6 January 2014
Dunkirk," A hot mess
","I hated this movie. It did a horrible job of telling an important period in history. the script was amateurish. However, the biggest problem was the editing. I can't believe this is on any 'best' movie of the year list.",3,3,5,3 March 2018
The Favourite," A constipated movie
","It should have been an interesting movie in theory -- but this was terribly mishandled. I mean, how many times can you show people striding down a long dark hallway from one bedroom to another and expect the audience to be interested. So much repetition, so slow moving. The acting was good - oftentimes excellent - but the script was a mess, the direction was haphazard and it was historically a train wreck.Dangerous Liaisons (1988) was a similar type of movie - and is a great example of how to do a drawing room comedy/drama. The Favourite is a good example of what not to do with this genre.",2,19,34,2 January 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Call Me When It's Over
","Classic example of what can go wrong with a good story and good acting when in the hands of the wrong editor and director. Good editing could have improved this movie a lot. There was zero chemistry between the two leads. I didn't for a moment believe that either of them were obsessed with the other. There was too many redundant shots of bicycle riding to nowhere, and 'let's go swimming' scenes that really added nothing to the story. However, all of the scenes were beautifully filmed.I put this in a category with 'Ryan's Daughter.' It's overwrought, over worked, and in 20 years, nobody will remember this film.",6,52,119,24 March 2018
The Departed," Departed is example of what's wrong with movies
","Bad, bad, bad. All that big named talent and they were terrible -- sleepwalking through a horrible script that was never ending in its repetitiveness. Poorly directed -- it was like a junior college student's idea for a movie. It needed to be 30 minutes shorter.Hasn't this movie been done before -- and done better? This is clearly a movie that was done by committee -- and not a committee of people who love movies.I still maintain we will never see Matt Damon in a love scene with a woman. Reason: he's not a good enough actor to play a heterosexual leading man. It would be too much of a stretch for him.I want my money back.",1,16,35,28 October 2006
The Greatest Showman," Truly entertaining
","Damn the critics! This is good, solid entertainment. It held my interest and I was caught up in the singing and dancing. I liked it a lot better that most of the other movies I've seen this year.",8,3,6,29 April 2018
Unbroken," Nothing to rave about.
","There is nothing original about this movie. It merely takes scenes from other movies to extremes. I saw bits and pieces of Bridge Over the River Kwai, Cast Away and of course American Graffiti -- the standard way to end a so-so movie in Hollywood is to have a 1 minute summary of their characters lives. It might have been unique and satisfying at one time -- but it's not in this case.Standing on its own as a movie - apart from the book -- it is an OK movie but nothing great. But if you compare the movie with the book, it sadly missed the mark. The book is inspirational -- and the most fascinating part of the book was the post-war years. Instead, the movies focuses (perhaps over-focuses) on the WW II aspects of the book. Perhaps Ms. Jolie-Pitt will decide to make a sequel that really gets to the meat of the story. In the meantime -- save your money -- this is truly a rental.",3,39,78,25 December 2014
Green Book," About as good as movies get
",It held my interest. It was well acted. Perfectly cast. A good story. Well directed. I don't get the criticism that has been flung at this movie.,10,0,3,6 May 2019
