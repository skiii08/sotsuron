The Blair Witch Project," Make More Like This!
","Too many movies today come from the big budget school of force feeding the audience emotions.  Not many films actually allow us to THINK, to develop our own impressions of what's going on, to feel for the characters as if we were experiencing what they were.  This is an outstanding movie.  Probably not the scariest movie ever, in the standard sense of the word.  But, what this movie does is follow you out of the theatre, into your car, back home, and into your dreams.  I challenge anyone who has seen The Blair Witch Project to tell me that the last 5 minutes didn't have an effect on them, or that the last 3 seconds didn't make their head spin.  Please, Hollywood, make more like this!!",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
