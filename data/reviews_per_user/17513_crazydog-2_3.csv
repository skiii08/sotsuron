The Blair Witch Project," the hype...and the movie HAS A SPOILER!!!!
","i wrote the title like that because they are two very different things. so, here it is: 'the star wars of indie-movies'(referring to the hype) as said somewhere. I was really thrilled when i heard this new, horrible,'scarier than the exorcist'-movie was coming.(although a movie doesn't have to be scarier than 'sesame street' to defeat the exorcist in horror)I like scream, i.k.w.y.d.l.s. and their sequels, urban legend etc, these new 'horror' movies, but they don't scare me one bit. frankly, i don't know any person who can scared by a man/woman with a mask killing teens in most horrible ways. while watching the killings i hope he/she dies soon so the movie can go on with REAL horror: WAITING something to happen. The makers of Blair... have realized the true meaning of horror:(as i said)WAITING that something happens. The real horror is when you are alone in the  dark forest and suddenly, you hear something.... you come paranoid, you start thinking what's there...The real horror comes from your mind, you create it yourself. So the film makers realized it, BUT they didn't have enough skill to create this speechless horror. Sure, Blair... was a little bit scary,my heart even started jumping faster in the end, but mostly i was hugely disappointed. It seems the hype just was bigger than the movie.****SPOILER****** DO _NOT_ READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE*********SPOILER********' ------------------------------------------------------------- But there were some positive things too: 1.they didn't show us the blair witch. if they had, the idea of the movie would have been spoiled. We don't know if there were really something in the woods, we don't know if Heather,Joshua and Michael really saw anything. a friend of mine even suggested: what if michael was the 'blair witch!!!'  He could have put the weird things on the trees(don't ask me how!), and when Heather and Joshua were killed(or were they...) Michael could have done it!!!! I know this theory is really out there but that's just the beauty of the story:WE DON'T KNOW 2.Acting was really realistic, people in panic  probably had behaved the way they did. -- But mostly, the movie just makes you think, where else I could have spent those 40 marks that the ticket cost.",Null,0,0,30 November 1999
The Usual Suspects," Brilliant film with fantastic Kevin Spacey
","Plot (no spoilers): Five men are brought in a framed line up. Police guestions them, and no-one will talk. They decide to do a little 'f**k you' to the police. This story goes to the past, told by Verbal Kint, a cripple member of the gang. There are one name that keeps coming up:Keyser Soze, a Hungarian criminal, who's the Devil himself.As the story goes, we learn what this man has to do with the story... I admit it- at the first time I saw this film I didn't really understand it.(You know WHY did something happen or WHAT exactly just happened) All this because of one reason-I didn't follow it from the first minute and didn't think about anything. I thought that by watching it I could spend one boring afternoon doing nothing.That was my mistake. To understand 'The Usual suspects' you mustn't lay your eyes off the screen. Everything (well ALMOST everything) in this film has a meaning. So,as I said I didn't get it very well at the first time so I watched for a second time. The film goes on and you find yourself watching every second of the the film-and loving it. The actors are great-especially FANTASTIC Kevin Spacey(he got Oscar for this role) who plays Verbal Kint. Film's dark music fits to the movie perfectly-actually everything in this movie is perfect.10/10 One of my favorite movies ever.",10,0,1,19 May 1999
Titanic," Spoiler:the ship sinks!!!
","OK, I do have something other to say too. First I want to say, I really liked this movie. Great special effects, beautiful succesful young hollywood stars, a romantic love story and a catastrophe 80 years ago. What else do you need from a movie? But then I started thinking more: First thing that started annoying me was well, the entire idea. Who gives James Cameron the right to romanticize a terrible accident that took the life of a thousand people? Sure, the movie shows us how cruel the reality is. But the movie seems to tell us that Titanic and it's sinking are nothing compared to the sad and once-in-a-lifetime-lovestory. Then the second thing that annoyed me was the main plot: A rich girl and a poor boy and rich girl's parent(s) try to keep them apart? C'MON, like we haven't seen that before!!! The whole lovestory was just a big clicheÂ´ with of course required tears in the end. The best thing was FANTASTIC special effects. The sinking looks so real that it almost feels you were there yourself. BUT not even the greatest cover hide the empty inside. Oh, about the Oscars: Titanic didn't deserve half of it's Oscars: Best song-Celine Dion's horrible sounding My heart will go on.WHO CAN STAND IT!?!? Best movie- if this was the best movie of the year I'm glad I didn't see the worst. ANYWAY, Titanic is ok, it IS entertaining.I'm sure it wasn't meant to be anything else.",Null,3,5,30 November 1999
