The Blair Witch Project," As if you really were watching a home made video
","Blair Witch Project is a simple well made, thriller/horror flick.Back in 1994, 3 student filmmakers both make a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch. They interviewed some locals who were superstitious and religious on the subject of the Blair Witch. They say that numerous victims were killed by the witch if you trespass in her woods. So the 3 independent filmmakers go to those woods which is in the middle of no where.They were enjoying their project during the first few days. But every night they hear the sounds of stones being tapped together. And it's as if it was coming from all directions. And the next morning they'd find something different near their camp site. They figure it was just a prank played by someone, but they didn't tell anyone on where they were going. And eventually they start to freak out and have suspicion that the curse of the Blair Witch is more than a legend.Unlike the gory, overrated, and badly written flicks you'd see now and days. Blair Witch Project is unique and very well thought up. The cool thing is it's all filmed on student camera and video camera. Contains no visual effects, at all. It's so realistic, it'll make you think it really did happen. I won't give away the ending but it is one of those mysterious movies. And after you watch it, it'll make you think and imagine the whole movie and the student filmmakers experience.",Null,0,1,19 November 2006

Howl's Moving Castle," Like any Miyazaki film, this is another great movie
","I saw this movie first time ever in the theaters, I was lucky to of seen it on the Big Screen. It was a big opportunity to see a Ghibli Film on the big screen. This movie is based off of a book by Diana Wynne Jones. I read the book before seeing the film. The movie is very different than the book, but those who read it will recognize some parts fro the book.I don't care if it wasn't 100% true to the original book, it's still a wonderful movie to see. The background, characters, animation, and voice talents is all top notch. Plus Billy crystal is perfect with his role, one of the main things that made this movie have funny moments.Those who liked Hayao Miyazaki's previous films will enjoy this one. Anything directed, written, or has Miyazaki's name on it is worth seeing.I give this Masterpiece a 9/10 and just as good as the acclaim Spirited Away.I hope this movie will get an award for best Animated film of 2005.",Null,2,3,20 June 2005
Gremlins," Gremlins rule!
","I didn't see this movie till Summer 2005.But I gotta say that i enjoyed the movie a lot.Gremlins is about Gizmo a furry Monwaki who is bought by a traveling salesman who wanted to find the perfect Christmas present for his son, Billy.In order to take care of this creature, you have to follow 3 rules. 1. Let it near bright light, Sunlight can kill it. 2. Don't let it get near any source of water 3. NEVER feed it after midnightIf you do feed these types of creatures after midnight. You'll be seeing some nasty results. Gremlins are vicious and mischievous creatures. They like to dismantle machinery and have the pleasure of killing people.It's up to Billy and his new little friend Gizmo to eliminate the Gremlins before they turn the whole town upside down.If I saw this movie years before I'd be scared to death if I saw it for the first time as a kid.It's rated PG. Violent and thrilling for a PG movie. I recommend it to Ages 10 and up. Please know this movie may frighten little kids. I know I'd be if I did saw it as a kid.But Gremlins is highly recommended to those who like to see little creatures attacking.",Null,0,2,11 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," All Sagas have a beginning
","This is Episode 1 of the Star Wars Series. It's know to be the untold story of Darth Vadar. and it's token place 32 years before the original Star Wars Trilogy.The movie shows some familiar characters and what Darth Vadar is like as a young boy before he turned to the dark side. It introduces what the Jedi are like when it was still an active academy of peace keepers.And what it was like before the Galatic Empire was establish.The movie introduces some new characters, locations, and technology. Like any Star Wars movie it has the traditional Light Saber battles. Only these ones involve with more skilled Jedi.Phatom Menace is enjoyable to watch, but it's not a movie for every one. All of the old trilogy fans might be disappointed with this one. So I won't guarantee you that's a must see film.It's done by the same people who brought us the original Star Wars. The special effects are very good. And the Pod-Race is one of my favorite parts of the whole movie.It's still Star Wars. And a good movie in my opion. I give it 7/10. I don't care if it's the most hated Star Wars movie to allot of people.",Null,0,4,11 July 2005
The Ring," Only if you like strange/thriller/mystery movies.
","This one of my least favorite movies. So I'll try to make this review less abusive as possible to those who do like it.The Ring is about a mysterious video when it's viewed by someone they die within 7 days. After a girl dies within 7 days a single mom who works for a newspaper watches the video and doesn't find it possible for a strange video cassette to kill people for watching it.Within the next few days on investigating the single mom finds a lot of strange things going on. And soon believes that she will die soon enough.But with a lot of studying from the video and investigating she's close from solving this mystery.It's not my kind of movie. Probably because I'm not obsess with these kind of movies. But don't take my word for it, if you like Strange Thriller flicks then you might like this. Rent it or borrow it from a friend.Course one of the good things about this movie is they have Daveigh Chase from 'Lilo and Stitch' & 'Spirited Away' playing a role in this movie.",Null,0,1,31 May 2006
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Harrison Ford's most memorable role.
","Indiana Jones is a different kind of action movie. Taken place in 1936 when the Nazi party was still running Germany. And WW2 was yet to occur.Dr. Henry 'Indiana' Jones Jr. is an archaeologist who is likes to travel the world to find adventure and priceless artifacts. Course not all the time does he succeed in getting what he wants.One day when he's attending his archeology class at an university in Washington D.C. he's given a job in finding something that's said to be impossible to uncover. The Lost Ark that the Hebrews carried back in the days of Moses. Which is said to be a connection with communicating with God. The price of the Ark is unimaginable.Finding this ark will be risky and a challenge when the Nazis are already in progress in locating it in the Deserts of Africa. Once Indy finds the Ark he'll learn it's more than a price less artifact for a display in a museum.Raiders of the Lost Ark is done by the same people who did Star Wars. Directed by Spielberg and written by George Lucas. It has action, humor, fights, and plenty of good stuff for a perfect action filled movie. It's worth owning on DVD.",Null,0,0,23 April 2006
Se7en," Better than today's thriller movies.
","One of the few thriller movies I liked so far next to The Shining and Hitchcock's movies.Seven is about Brad Pitt playing a young detective and Morgan Freeman playing a much older detective. They're both involved in a twisted murder case that is linked to the seven deadly sins.Envy, Sloth, Lust, Gluttney, Wrath, Greed and Pride.The victims of these murders are linked to those sins.The murder behind these killings is a sick and obsess Catholic who's been planing to do this for quite sometime.Our 2 detectives must find the killer and who'll end up being the last few victims of this scheme.I rarely make good reviews for thriller movies cause the ones today are full of sh*t. I think this movie is way better than the Ring or Saw movies. Not obsess with Brad Pitt but Morgan Freeman was great with his role.I think this movie is worth buying if you like mystery/thriller/murder movies. This is a rare treat for a good thriller movie.",Null,0,0,14 May 2006
Wayne's World," Carvey and Myers make a great team!
","Before Austin Powers or Shrek, Mike Myers did Waynes World.Partner with Dana Carvey who both started out on Saturday Night Live, had created a one of a kind movie.Wayne's World is about 2 college age guys who star in their own TV show called Waynes World which airs from Wayne's basement.Wayne is the one with the Moloch and hat. Garth is the one with the blonde hair and frame eye glasses. They're cool, funny, and pretty much 2 dudes you'd find at a mall.Living in Aurora, Illonois, Wayne and Garth enjoy Rock and Rock, Heavy Metal, Solo Singer music. They're very well known at their home town cause of their TV show.When they meet a TV producer who offers them to be part of the 'Noah's Arcade' advertising, they couldn't refuse when it comes to a large offering in money.Not only that but Wayne got to meet Casandra the Sexy Catonese Singer. He fell in love with her. I wouldn't blame him for having the hots for her cause she is hot in my opion.With plenty of slap stick humor, jokes, and great moments. You'll know that Wayne's World is a movie to see again and again.If you like Mike Myers or Dana Carvey then you'll probably like this movie.",Null,3,7,30 May 2006
Akira," An excellent cult-classic anime.
","Before 'Memories' and 'Steamboy' there was 'Akira'.July 16, 1988, the outbreak of WW3 comes to an end. When Tokyo was wiped out by an enormous nuclear explosion. 31 years later in an alternate 2019, Neo-Tokyo stood where Old-Tokyo once stood from the nuclear blast.Neo-Tokyo is large, vast, and very high tech compared to the Tokyo we knew well. Over the past couple of decades, the city is over run by gangs and the newer generation. Inlcuding an unbalanced uproar of violence, drugs, crime, and sex. Shotaro Kaneda, leader of his own bike gang is someone to look up to when it comes to fighting off bullies and helping out someone in need. Including his friend Tetsuo, who was never a good fighter and was pushed around a lot as a kid. When in doubt, Shotaro will always be there to stand up for him. Shotaro, Tetsuo their pals were taking care of things perfectly in their neighborhood.Right until they encounter a mysterious decayed kid who's on the run. This kid has mysterious kinetic powers and is being tracked down by the military. When Tetsuo encounters the kid, he immediately inherits some strange illness which makes him a victim for the military to take and examine. Shotaro tries to get his friend back, but failed. Multiple experiments were performed on Tetsuo as he is now similar to the decayed kid he encountered earlier. The power he has is believed to be similar to Akira's power. And Akira is known for being the most powerful human being with Psychological powers.Shotaro, some of his friends and a group of protesters seek to help Tetsuo from the clutches of the military. What has become of Tetsuo? Who was that Decade kid? And who is Akira? This movie proves that Otomo was brilliant in the art of animation from the very beginning of his career. This movie broke the limits of an average anime film. And has all the right ingredients for an enjoyable movie. Including Excitement, violence, character development, girls, guns, choppers, technology, explosions, humor, and interesting script.It's an 80s anime with an 80s looks to it. But the animation is just brilliant for only being 2-D. The characters designs are cool. The locations are very visual. And the plot is well thought up.I didn't see this movie until after I was familiar with Otomo's other works. In my book, his skills in anime are worthy. And I can see why this movie was so well received during it's original and American release. It's definitely a cult-classic to watch time after time.Due to it being R rated. It has a lot of violence, including lots of blood, profanity, brief nudity, a few disturbing scenes, and suggestive themes. so viewer digression is advised when watching this movie.I recommend it to average anime fans, experts, newbies, as well as those who seen Otomo's other works.",Null,1,6,12 January 2007

","The Rookie is another based off of a true story movie.It's about Dennis Quaid portraying a guy who wanted to play major league baseball but couldn't because he's always moving with his family. And his dad never cared about his son's dream of being a baseball player.30 some years later, he's a science teacher who coaches baseball. He's married, and the kids at school like him as their coach.One day when practicing with a mph gun. It turns out that he can through a ball at 99 mph. With an arm like that he can be able to try out at the majors.This movie isn't too bad. I'm surprised that it's ranked as one of the few family sport movies. Due to the fact that it's a G rated movie, it's nothing compared to the other average sport movies. It doesn't have any language or anything that would offend young viewers.But I only recommend it to those who like baseball or family safe movies.",Null,1,2,19 June 2006
Underworld," Gothic, Dark, Action pack, and cool

Where Vampires and Werewolves exist. For Centuries they've been fighting each other in their own war.They're both different in a way of fighting, weaponry, and hideouts.The Vampires resemble Gothic people and live at a large mansion.

Their hideout is in run down areas next to the alley ways and subway system. They have laboratories and weapons developments to find easier ways in defeating the Vampires.The werewolves are after a guy who is suppose to be the key in stopping this little war or something like that. And by doing that the guy they seek must bite him to become a werewolf like them. When that happens the Vampires won't be able to bite him cause it would kill him instantly.Will the Werewolves succeed their goal?

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Bigger than the first one.
","I managed to see this movie a day after the premiere, and this time I knew it was going to be great after seeing the first one on DVD.It's done by the same people who did the first one and they even brought back a lot of familiar actors as well as some new ones for this sequel.Takes place sometime after the first one where Elizabeth and Will Turner's wedding was interrupted when a warrant for their arrest has been made for them both for helping Jack Sparrow escape in the previous movie.While Jack Sparrow's crew on the Blackpearl has grew larger than before. And little did he knew is that he's schedule to be a victim of the Flying Dutchman, Davy Jones. And there's no turning back on this one cause the Flying Dutchman can track him down anywhere at sea.Jack must find a way to get himself out of this with the help of Will Turner and Elizabeth. As well as unexpected characters involved in the same mess.I liked this movie a lot. It has element you won't see from the original. And it's action pack so there's never a dull moment. That and the ending is what you would call a cliffhanger. Which makes this one like 'Empire Strikes Back' where you'll have to see the next one to see how it ends.The next one 'At the World's End' is in production. I can tell that the next one will surpass the other 2.",Null,0,2,16 July 2006
Rocky V," The fall of the champ.
","After defeating the lethal Ivan Drago, Rocky has suffered some of the injuries he's received but figured it's nothing. So he heads back home to America to be welcomed as a big hero for the U.S. The press asks if he'll fight again, and a Boxing Manager name George Washington Duke offers Rocky an endless opportunity, but Rocky didn't give a straight answer to either one of those, as Adrian insisted that he's planning to retire, and got him out of there before any hesitation. Sometime later at Balboa Manor, Adrian finds out that Paulie gave their loan to a fake banker deal without realizing it. They went to the bank to try to straighten it out but, it was already too late. All the money Rocky has made was gone.Rocky figures that if he fights again, he could win back what was lost. But Adrian tells Rocky, he must see a doctor on his condition. And after a brain scan, it turns out that Rocky has developed some brain damage. The effects are irreversible and will get worse if he fought again. Rocky didn't want to admit it being true, but for Adrain's sake, he's forced to retire. And the Manor was sold. Rocky, Adrian, and Rocky Jr. moved to Paulie's home to live in. Rocky is back to being the worthless bum he was from the start. He decides to reopen Mick's Boxing Ring and become a trainer like Mick himself. Meanwhile Washington Duke does all he could to get Rocky to agree with him to fight for him. But none worked, as Adrain would be there to defend Rocky's condition.Tommy Gun, a young boxer has traveled all the way from Oklahoma to meet Rocky. And would like to learn more about his boxing moves. Rocky didn't know anything about professional managing but gave it a shot. And soon finds himself a new student to be taught about boxing. They soon became brothers, but little does Rocky know is that he's spending more time with his student than his family. Including his own son, who is losing faith in him.This fifth installment to the Underdog story, isn't as bad as I've it was. Only reason why it's receive negative reviews is cause it's Rocky's down fall in boxing. Things might seem bad at first, but it does become satisfying by the very end. And the climax fight is one of the best parts. The Rocky fans might not like this one, but it's still a Rocky movie to see every now and then for my perspective. It'll be cool to see Rocky come back in the ring in the latest and final chapter: 'Rocky Balboa'.",Null,3,3,20 December 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," I shoulda known it was going to be good.
","I didn't see this movie till it came out on DVD back 2 years ago.I regretted not seeing it in theaters, because I kept thinking it'll suck, because it didn't look like it be anything similar to the ride at Disneyland.But I was surprised to see that it's a very well done action movie. And surprised that it's even done by Disney. Cause it's not the common Family Friendly movie you'd find from Disney.The movie of course takes place in the Caribbean and during the 16th or 17th Century era. Which is when pirates ruled the 7 seas. A ship was sailing across the Atlantic which came across a wreckage of another ship. With only one passenger who is a young boy named Will Turner. Who had a gold medallion in his position. A girl named Elizabeth noticed the medallion to be pirate related so she took it and hid it from the ship's crew so that way they wouldn't think that Will is a pirate.8 years later Elizabeth is more grown up and Will is a blacksmith who makes and repairs swords for the army of the seaport town of Cape Royal. Life was very calm and peaceful till Jack Sparrow came ashore of Cape Royal. He is not your average pirate and he's very well known throughout the Caribbean. And there's a lot more to his back story than there seem to be.The medallion that Elizabeth holds is the key to breaking the curse of the pirates of the black pearl.I gotta admit i did like it quite a bit. I just wish I knew it was going to be a must see movie. It had action, great special effects, plenty of humor in some parts, and great characters to know while watching the movie.It's also unlike the common pirate movies you'd see anywhere else. Which is because it's a modern day made pirate movie. Those who are obsess with the ride might enjoy this movie a lot.",Null,3,5,5 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," C.S. Lewis's masterpiece now a full length movie.
","This has been my favorite book since 5th grade. I been looking forward in seeing this movie too.Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe is a novel taken place in 1940 back when WW2 had already occurred in England. 4 kids had to move to the countryside to avoid getting hurt from the Bombing that occurred in the city areas. They have to live at the Professor's(who's suppose to be a relative of theirs)Large Manor. They were given strict rules in not doing anything too noisy while they're in the Manor. The kids got bored with nothing to do so they played hide and go seek. One of them who was a young girl named Lucy decides to hide in the wardrobe. But soon she discovers that there's an another world beyond the wardrobe.I think it was a perfect movie adaption of the 55 year old novel. It was very truthful to the original book itself. A few small changes here or there, but it followed the book the way it should. The special effects are excellent. Some humor here and there. I was very satisfied with how the movie went.I'm sure other Narnia fans will be satisfied with this movie as well. It's rated PG for Battle Sequences, light fighting, no gory fighting. There wasn't a drop of blood in the this movie. So someone 10 and older or mature enough for a PG movie can see it.I give it a 9.8/10",Null,1,2,20 December 2005

Her name is CatWoman who is a woman with the instincts of a cat. It's undetermined whether she's friend or foe.With 2 psychopathic characters running around Gotham. It'll be interesting on how BatMan will be able to restore peace to the city.This sequel is as great as the first one.

Brokeback Mountain," Not Oscar Worthy in my judgment.
","I remember when this first came out back in 2005. I didn't know what it was about, I just kept hearing it was gay every time someone at my high school would bring it up. I finally saw it last February.It takes place in the 60s-70s. About 2 young cowboys given a job to guide thousands of sheep through the wilderness, through Brokeback Mountain, and to the ranch that's located there. As both Dennis and Jack bound with one another. They soon begin to have an unpredictable relationship. And liked each other in a way. But after their job was over they went back to their lives. They both went their separate ways and married straight women. But have met again time after time. But hardly anyone knows what they are up to. And soon things become complicated about why couldn't they get together and start a life at Brokeback. As well as their relations with their wives are becoming thinner and thinner.Please know that I'm straight, & didn't watch this movie because of it's theme. I just wanted to know what the whole big fuss was about it. And despite it having some great visuals in the backgrounds and Anna Hatheway playing as a secondary character. I give it credit on the camera job. But I don't think it's really worthy of being awarded for any category in cinema. The story is what gives me negative thoughts about it. I have nothing against homosexuals. It's just not a movie to see again and again.Brokeback Mountain is recommended to those who don't mind gay people. Even though the word gay wasn't used at all through out the movie. But those who are against non-straight people will hate it a lot.",Null,3,23,3 March 2007

And the first Hayao Miyazaki film I've seen(way before I even knew who he was).This was released in Japan back in 1988 along with 'Grave of the Fireflies' Came into the USA on VHS back in 1993(owned the Video for more than 10 years) and an upcoming DVD with a new English Debut coming in 2006! The story is taken place in the PostWar Era of Japan. With these 2 girls and their father moving to the Countryside. The girls like the house they've moved to(which is a 2 story home which is bigger than the other homes in the area). They're father is a College Professor. And their mother has a certain illness that had to be treated at this hospital that's in the country. Which is why they moved to the country so they can visit her more often.The 2 girls Satsuki and Mei, are enjoying their new home and the country life. Little do they know is that their neighbor is a big and powerful forest spirit who loves kids.Throughout the movie Totoro will help out Mei and Satsuki when they're in trouble. After you see the movie, you'd feel good about yourself.Unlike other Family Films this one is very special. It has wonderfully done backgrounds, characters, and music. The story is well written too. It's rated G has only one bath scene with the Dad bathing with his 2 girl(there's no mild nudity in that scene just know that in Japan it's completely normal to have a family bath). There aren't any villains or any one too cruel. It's a safe and perfect movie for the whole family to watch.I really recommend this to those who are Anime fans, Miyazaki fans, or even Animation fans.Get the DVD as soon as possible once it's in stores!",Null,0,1,6 November 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," It breaks so many levels in all Pirate movies.
","I awaited for this movie to come out for a year and got to see this Memorial Day weekend. And it was everything I'd hope for a third movie to be.Continuing from where we left off in 'Dead Man's Crest'. Elizabeth, Will, (newly revived)Barbosa, and the rest of the crew. Travel to Sangapore to obtain a sea chart which has the location of the World's End. The place where Jack Sparrow & the Black Pearl were sent to by Davy Jones.Meanwhile the Navy has made preparations in eliminating all of the pirates to once and for all end the Piracy Era. Davy Jones seeks to reclaim his heart that's now in the hands of the Caribbean government. The Flying Dutchman and the Navy made a deal by teaming up to exterminate the remaining pirates at sea. Davy Jones agreed to do so because they threaten to destroy his heart if he'd disobeyed.It's all a fight to the finish as both sides will soon battle to see who rules the 7 seas.I really enjoyed this one a lot. As it features much more than you'd expect from the previous 2 installments. Everything that was unsolved in the second one is resolved in this one. Despite it having excellent special effects and a well done job on the locations. I liked how unique the flow of the story is. And I talking about how all the action and comedy work so well together to make it entertaining. That and there weren't many obvious parts which is good. Movies with unexpected parts makes watching it enjoyable.Besides some monologuing scenes, there's plenty of excellent moments to enjoy while viewing it. And the climax ending is unexpected and well thought up. Plus this movie has so few openings that could lead to a 4th installment.Ignore those who have negative thoughts on this one. If you liked the previous one, I guaranteed that this one is as much of a classic as the first 2. I know so, cause I'm going to see it a second time and looking forward to owning it on DVD.",Null,3,7,4 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," Third Spider Man movie, Third review.
","I finally saw this movie, and it's six years in the making for both the trilogy and my reviews on the franchise itself.This time Spider Man/Peter Parker has three times the trouble. Two bad guys on the loose including a dude who's filling in the shoes of the Green Goblin from the first movie, and an escaped convict who appears to be another trouble maker for Spider-Man. Not to mention the encounter with a black substance that seems to be an improvement for Spider-Man's powers but may also be the key to one of his other problems. That includes his decision on his daily life, career, girlfriend, and his future as Spider Man.It has action, it has amazing special effects, and everything that was included from the previous two movies. As well as covering up some unanswered situations that were left unsolved in the previous installments.The problem is I can't except this third installment to be any better than the first two. Which I already posted my comments on(check my reviews on Spider Man 1 & 2 for more info). Again I'm not obsess with the entire Spider Man universe. Which is one of the many reasons why this movie didn't meet my demands on what a second sequel should be like. Nothing really made me like it more than the first two. Probably because it still has too many out of situation scenes that just made my eyes rolled. As in obvious and 'what is he thinking?' type of scenes. It just made me feel like I was watching Spider Man 1 or 2 again.If the script was improved in a feel parts of it. Then I might accept it's brilliants. But in the end the whole Spider Man Trilogy isn't worthy of being own on DVD.Not to offend the fans in anyway possible. I'm only giving my 5 cents of thought on the movie in general. I have nothing against the whole Spider Man series. It's just the live action movies could of been better made.To come to an end, I only recommend this to any die-hard fan of the series or the Spider Man Movies in general. For those who read much more negative reviews than mine. Then rent it or borrow it in case you're not sure if it's worth owning on DVD.",Null,0,1,16 March 2008
The Terminator," A pretty cool Sci-Fi movie to watch.
","I didn't see this till 2005. Since there was no way I could of seen it before since it's rated R.Anyways this is a cool movie. And the title that Arnold is famous for.This is taken place in L.A. of 1984. Out of nowhere a man appears out of thin air. And something about him isn't human. In another area another man appears out of thin air, and seems to act more human. At the other side of town an ordinary woman named Sarah Conner is your average girl of the 80s. Little does she know that her life will soon change forever.She hears the news about 2 woman getting murdered, it didn't seem too important to her, except those 2 victims are both named Sarah Conner. She soon gets the bad feeling that the killer will be after her next. Once she encounters the killer she gets saved by a man named Kyle Reese, who was given orders to protect her from the killer who is in fact a lethal machine from the future called a Terminator.Terminator is indeed a classic Sci-Fi film. I recommend this to those who like Sci-Fi flicks or 80s theme stuff.",Null,1,1,17 January 2006
Cloverfield," Most unique 'Monster Attacking City theme' movie ever.
","A regular night party is being held in New York. And everyone is having a great time. Right until an unexpected earthquake occurred. Then there was a new flash about an unknown intruder has invaded the Big Apple. Every local in the city was curious in knowing what is rotten in Manhatten. Right until they're all running for their lives because of an unknown creature that's so destructive it's wrecking the whole city piece by piece. The whole national guard is doing all they can to stop it. But what will become of New York and all the New Yorkers? The whole movie is view by a group of teenagers who didn't expect to be in the middle of an inhuman city attack. They don't know where it came from. Or what it really is. They just know it's big and dangerous.What makes this movie an instant classic. Is that it's nothing compared to other monster related movies. For instants it's all filmed on a video camera. Giving it a realistic feel to it. Plus we as the audience will be confused and befouled by what is going on. Because there are no other pointer views besides the group of teens we see throughout the movie.I like that effect for the movie. Because if they revealed too much of what is happening. Then it be too ordinary to watch. Being questionable like the main cast makes the whole thing worth watching entirely.And if this was filmed with a cinema camera then it be no different than any other ordinary monster film. If you're looking for something that looks basic but entirely original. Then Cloverfield won't disappoint you. It has a great complex plot, memorable moments, explosions, mysterious themes, suspense, and great special effects all in a video taped movie.Cloverfield is a hit, and an instant cult classic. I'll be looking forward to the sequel.",Null,0,1,9 February 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burton's most Violent/Dark movie ever.
","This is based off of the famous American tale of Sleepy Hollow. Which is know to be the first American Fairytale. Only this is different from the story you know by heart.In this version Ichabald Crane is a New York investigator not a school teacher who uses surgery tools to solve how a person dies. He's given an assignment on the murders that occurred in the town of Sleepy Hollow.When he was there he learned from the locals that the murders are done by the Headless Horseman. Who was originally a violent Hessian who killed many American Troops during the Revolutionary Era of America. He himself eventually got killed when his own head chopped off.And it is believed that the ghost of that Hessian aka the headless Horseman comes back from the dead and kill innocent people till he finds his head.Ichabald who isn't superstitious finds it impossible for that to be true. And tries to convince them that the killings are done by a murder.But as the plot goes along, Ichabald will soon learn that these killings are more than just a ghost story. And the mystery behind it all is very unpredictable.I have to admit I did like this movie a lot. I wouldn't of been able to seen it back in 1999 cause I was still a kid back then. But I think it was well done even if it's different from the original story. It's the only R rated movie Tim Burton has done so far.it also has plenty of celebrates like Johnny Depp as Ichabald, Christopher Lee, Ian McDiamard, 2 actors from Harry Potter films, and 2 actors from Tim Burton's BatMan Returns.A must see for the die hard Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fans. Just be sure you're mature enough to see an R rated movie. Cause this movie has a lot of violence in it.",Null,1,2,1 June 2006

The mother will soon learn that Silent Hill is more than a dull boring town when strange and hellish things start to appear out of no where.This movie is close to being a bad,over-rated horror flick. But after seeing the entire thing I consider it an average horror flick.Inlcuding it's use of CGI, thrilling parts, mystery, suspects, and off the wall stuff. Seeing it the first time weirded me out. While at the end it all becomes clear in a way of saying.I didn't know it was based off of a game at first, but I'm sure those who are familiar with it would enjoy this film.

A lot has happened since then.Luke Skywalker is becoming better in the ways of becoming a Jedi.And a new Death Star has been completed.The first part of the movie introduces Jabba the Hut and his gang of Alien goons. Which is one of my favorite parts of the whole movie.It even shows some newer characters as well. And a match between Darth Vadar and Luke which is a fight to the finish.Has a lot of action, excitement, and surprises in this one.It even has the best ending which makes a perfect finale for this Sci-fi Saga.Anyone who likes the other Star Wars Films will like this one a lot.A 10/10 for this one.

Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," The most grim musical you'll ever see as a movie.
","The gritty part of London in the 19th century. Lived a deranged barber named Sweeney Todd who was double crossed by a Judge many years ago. Sweeney now awaits to seek revenge on that Judge for ruining his life forever and for transforming his personality from a gentleman to a mad man with a razor.I've expected this movie to be unique in many ways. It's a musical so 3/4's of it has singing in it. It's directed by Tim Burton who has a brilliant mind for making goth theme movies. Also contains a cast of well known actors. Johnny Depp and Helena Boham Carter who both worked with Tim before did an amazing job together. Also two actors from Harry Potter, Timothy Spall & Alan Rickman make an appearance in this film.The idea of this musical was never made into a feature film until now. I never heard of it before, but it is something only Burton would direct. Despite the theme of story being very dark and grim, the movie does have a few good moments to it.Not saying it's bad, because I've seen Burton's other movies that surpass this one. If I have to use a word to describe it, it's Burton's most unique directed film. It is worthy of having a place in any Burton fan list.Please be advise that this movie is almost as gory as Sleepy Hollow(which is a great movie). And the second R rated movie Burton has directed.",Null,0,1,19 February 2008

But they both ended up being banned from doing figure skating after things went wrong. Even though they're both banned from figure skating. They're not banned from doing 'Duat Figure Skating'. So a coach decides to force the two to work together as this is the only way they'll ever get to skate for sport again. Despite both of them having different thoughts and different attitudes.There's nothing to look forward to for this movie. I never give a care about Will Ferrel. While John Hedder has been in better ones. The whole idea of this movie just didn't work with the whole plot hole, secondary characters, and less humorous moments. As in the moments that make your eyes role instantly.In return, I knew this movie isn't that good to see.",Null,0,0,13 November 2007
Lost in Translation," Bill Murray's best roles

Specially when they don't know the language and have nothing exciting to do. But when they meet each other, and start to know each other more, they'll find this vacation to be less boring. Bob and Charollet will have a blast by running around Tokyo and enjoy the scenery even if they don't know Japanese.This movie has some great tips and advice when going to Japan. Which I hope to visit there one day. The plot and flow of the movie is good in my pointer view.After you see this movie you'll learn that being in Japan is like being on another planet. I think some of the Bill Murray fans will like this one.Rent it first and see if you like it.",Null,0,1,10 May 2006

Forrest Gump is an Alabama man who may seem like just an ordinary fellow you'd see on a street.But he has a quite an interesting life. He wasn't the smartest kid at school, took advice from his mother, and doesn't know his own destiny just yet.Throughout the movie you'll see that Forrest has been part of history as early as the mid 50s. He'll face many great opportunities, meet famous celebrities, and finding out what was his own purpose in life.Forrest Gump is one of my many favorite movies. And probably one of the best ones that Tom Hanks has ever done. The movie did a great job in recreating each time period Forrest is in.

The Village," I rather watch Twilight Zone
","Just saw it recently, and here are my thoughts.Story takes place at an old fashion village, where the people are forbidden to leave and forbidden to use red.Due to the sightings of the so called 'forbidden to mention' monsters.Strange stuff happens during the nights such as animals being skinned and murders.The villagers question the elders, but they know nothing and suggested that they were done by carnivores like wolves or coyotes. But there's something that they know that the villagers don't know.The first 15 minutes are very slow. It took awhile for some real suspense to happen. Up to an OK start, but it really stank at the end.If you seen it you'll be confused and questioned at the same time.In my opion i could of had done a better job with the story. At least something as good as Twilight Zone.I couldn't bare watching it again. My advice rent it if you like confusing suspense movies but just don't expect it to be great.",Null,0,1,2 July 2006

John Conner is now a young adult. He now lives as a loner, and he made sure his identity and where abouts remained unknown. He thinks he and his mom prevented Judgement day, but he's wrong. The day the machines will take over is sooner than he expected.A new terminator the T-X appears out of nowhere. This time it resembles a young woman. Unlike the T-1000, the T-X is faster, stronger, smarter, and more knowledge than the original Terminator itself. In another area another begin comes back from the future, and you've guess it, another Terminator who is the same model as the previous 2.It was sent back to 2003 to protect John Conner again. John Conner must find a way to prevent Judgement Day from starting, if possible. With the T-X on his trail this will be a fight to the finish.Older Terminator fans might not like this one. But I think it's very good, has action and some funny moments to it. Plus I think the T-X is very hot for a machine.

He applied to be the Groundskeeper for a Hotel Resort in the mountains during the Winter. They close the Hotel during the Winter because the place would be snowed in and be difficult for the cars to get out. It would cost to remove the snow all the time so closing the Hotel for the Season is cheaper.Jack got the Job and brings his family along to stay there for the season. Jack feels very honored to get a job like this. His wife is proud of him too. And his son, Danny is looking forward in seeing the place.Danny has a split personality where he has a bitter half named Tonny who live in his mouth. And has some physic powers too. This freaked Danny's mom a bit but a Doctor said it's nothing too serious.When they made to the Hotel they get a tour from the Hedge mazed to the lobby and to the Kitchen. This Hotel however is built over an Indian burial ground. Strange things happen in this type of place. Being trapped in a place like this all winter can make a kind man become a serial killer.I never read the book but I enjoyed this movie a lot.

There's never been a movie that touched me so much.But trust me it does end with a happy ending. But be worn it might effect you soft side.

Adrian doesn't consider it a wise idea, because it's been years since the last time Apollo boxed. But Apollo has confidants that he can beat the Communist because of his years of experience. Rocky agrees to aide him during the fight along with Duke, and Paulie.With a good performance started at the fight in Las Vegas, it ended in disaster. I won't review what happens there, see it in the movie for yourself. But after Apollo's defeat, Rocky isn't going to let a Russian get away without a fight. So he travels to Russia to challenge Ivan to a match on Christmas. But if Apollo couldn't beat Ivan, does that mean Rocky would face the same fate? See the match, and know that Rocky will show the Red Army what America is made out of.This sequel is pretty cool. Despite Rocky facing his most lethal opponent ever. And this was made when the Soviet Union was still in power. But it does have some good training sequences and a breathe taking fight. just a note that the Apollo Creed Fans might dislike this one. So I suggest renting it first.",Null,2,4,18 December 2006

His friends at his work would make him feel bad on all sorts of subjects. Right until they asked him if he's ever got involved with a woman before. Andy of course has never had much luck with women in the past either. He tried to act like he has got involved with a woman before. But his friends already found out that he's still a virgin.Upset and humiliated, Andy feels more embarrass than before in his life. To make it up for making fun of him, his friends will help him get involved with a woman. But can a guy like Andy get involved with a woman?

Ratatouille," Pixar hasn't let us down yet.
","As long time fan of Pixar's works. I still consider it the best American CGI company ever. After seven big hits, the company is very worthy in the animation industry. With Ratatouille marking as their eighth film. I had a hunch it'll be something different.Set in a retro era of France. Remy the rat lives with his family of pack rats in the country side. Him and everyone else survive by eating garbage and waste. Remy had it with rats living in this kind of style. So he eats fresh food instead, which is nothing compared to the taste of everyday garbage. His father always told him to stay away from humans. Because rats are seen as thieves and unsanitary. Remy however wants to change that method. As he was inspired by a chef on TV named Gustav, who states that anyone can cook. So Remy begins to mix ingredients together to create dishes for his pack. Hoping that it'll change the way rat eat by cooking simple ingredients rather than steal food.One day however, after an unexpected accident. Remy finds himself in Paris, France. Where he stumbles upon Gustav's restaurant. Where he he'll cross paths with Linguini, a non-experienced employee, who ended up as a poor garbage boy. Remy however will change his life by helping him become an experienced chef. But can he change the image of rats for good? I have to say that this movie is more than great. The word great can't match the excellence of the film. Ratatouille stands out differently than the other Pixar films do. Directed by Brad Bird who's given us 'Iron Giant' & 'The Incredibles'. Has created a unique CG animated movie. Unlike his previous titles, which were science fiction related. This one is more of a culinary/fictional story. But the style and look resembles both a Pixar and a Brad Bird film.Ignore all the negative reviews from those who don't know true art. Ratatouille is highly a highly recommended movie for all ages & all Pixar fans. The humor will make you laugh. The plot will be interesting to witness. And the characters will sheerly entertain you.I guaranteed it'll be the best CGI film of this year.",Null,1,3,9 July 2007
Spirited Away," One of Miyazaki's best films yet.
","Spirited Away is an excellent anime film. I didn't see the film till I learned about Miyazaki and the films he did. After I rented the movie, I was blown away. The animation, storyline, characters, and voice talents are perfect. I would consider it one of the best anime films I've ever seen.It's something to watch and enjoy again and again. What's special about it is Miyazaki made it for a 10 year old girl he knew. This movie is also made for people about to become 10 or people who use to be 10, because the main character is 10 years old and goes on this magical adventure.It's taken place in Modern Day Japan, it focuses on a little girl named Chihiro who's moving to a new town. She's not very comfident or happy about moving. Most kids would feel that way when they miss their old home. Her family is driving to their new home, only her dad couldn't find the right road that leads to their new home. They ended up going through a path that leads to an old building, on the other side of it is an Abandon theme park, or at least that's what Chihiro's Dad thinks. I recommend renting, buying orborrow this movie. If you like Miyazaki's other films, then you gotta see this one. You won't be disappointed, I guaranty it.My Rating: 9.5/10",Null,1,2,15 March 2005
Gone with the Wind," A classic but too long to watch every now and then
","I kept hearing this was a classic film that did excellent back in 1939.So I watched it, and my gosh it's longer than GodFather or Lord of the Rings.Gone with the Wind is a Drama and Historical Fiction movie.It's taken place during the Civil War. It doesn't feature any battle scenes just focuses on those who aren't fighting in the war.The movie's all about Scralet who's a wealthy girl who'll go through a lot of hard situations through this movie. Including trying to find a life she'll enjoy and a possible love of her life.I'm very surprised that they were able to make a movie like this back then.It's not bad for a Civil War film. Just it's very long to watch.Nothing inappropriate to watch but this movie might bore kids to death.If you like seeing a memorable classic film, then you might like to check this one out. I suggest renting it before buying it.It's different from the other classics.",Null,2,3,7 March 2006
Batman Begins," I admit it was good.
","When I first saw it, I thought it was awful. Watched it again, and immediately changed my mind about how I felt towards it a second time. Maybe cause I kept hating how this movie had a long prologue to Batman. But since I'm only half batman fan I had different thought on how a Batman film should be presented.To those who probably already knew as a fact, that this movie has no relation with the previous 4 Batman films. This in fact is an entirely new vision on the franchise after the huge criticisms on 'Batman & Robin' 11 1/2 years ago. Course back then Warner Bros. tried to make the franchise suit-able towards the kid audience by lightening up the theme. Big mistake, and they learn their own lesson on that and made sure they wouldn't waist millions on another Batman film again.So this time they're starting from scratch with a completely fresh new beginning that's suppose to give the franchise a better name in cinema. They succeeded with this being the best Batman film in a long time. I admit it's good for being a revision on the series. But I don't have the heart to call the greatest comic book movie in the world.In this film it tells how Bruce Wayne became the Dark Knight and how he learned to do martial arts in which it becomes handy later on. He learns the meaning of moral justice as a way to bring down criminals as he tries to become someone in which everyone would look up to for hope. Hope in which to bring down the criminal master minds in Gothan City where gangs and mobs run the streets. Only someone like Batman can clean up the streets, only to face another criminal mind who's about to spread fear in the city.If you are a fan of the series, then there's no problem in worrying about the out come of this film. Cause I'm sure all fans of the franchise will be more satisfied with over 'Batman and Robin' or 'Catwoman'.",Null,0,1,31 January 2009
Cars," Pixar's Lucky 7 installment and they haven't failed us yet.
","Cars is another instant classic after seeing it twice in theaters.it took at least 3 years for this one to be released and it was worth waiting for.Cars is about Lightning McQueen is famous and well known rookie of the year race car. His goal is to win the official yearly Piston Cup. His components are The King(long time winner and mascot of Dinoco Gasoline Company) and Thunder who is desperate to win the Piston Cup.Lightning McQueen is looking forward in winning the race right until he ended up getting lost while traveling to LA. Since he's a race car, he has no headlights or rear view mirrors so it made it a problem for him to find his way back on the right road.Eventually he whines up in Radiator Springs a hidden tourist contraption town. He accidentally ruin the road and is forced to repave it. He won't be allowed to leave town till he finishes his job. He's willing to drive out of there and make it to the Piston Cup Championship within a week. But soon he does learn there's more to life than winning a trophy.Like all Pixar movies this is a must see for both Pixar and Car lovers.It's the longest one yet and it's a movie for everyone to watch. The background, texture and landscapes are very well detailed. And all the Cars and other auto like characters are based off of actual models. The voice acting, dialog, and humor is great too. This film is also dedicated to Joe Ranft. Joe Ranft was the voice of many character in the previous Pixar films and has been a great employee/friend to John Lassater and the Pixar Staff since the Toy Story days.It's a movie not worth missing out. Cars is as great as the previous Pixar films. And be sure to stay through the entire credits and see an extra funny ending.",Null,0,0,24 June 2006
Schindler's List," A very well done Halucaust movie.
","I didn't see this movie till recent. But I've been told it's violent and very well received back in 1993. I'm 17 so it was OK for me to see a movie like this.Anyways Schindler's List takes place during WW2. And those who attended history class would know that Adolf Hitler had total control in most parts of Europe and banned all Jewish activity and removed all the Jewish from their homelands. It was the grimmer moment in the entire Jewish history.A man named Oscar Schindler was a business man and a Nazi. Only he was different from other Nazis. He provides the Jews work at his company only if they have working experience. Schindler in secretly does not kill or torture any Jews. He finds the whole thing wrong in a way. But he doesn't adment it because he's might receive serious consciences if he were to say he likes Jews.He makes sure his Jews aren't killed or sent to the more lethal concentration camps by making a list of hundreds of Jews that he bought with his own money. With that list he could be able to grant their freedom by the time the war is over.This movie is very well made. Spielberg did a great job in recreating this time period. I can see why it was given an Oscar during the 1993 Accadmy Awards. It's also interesting that 3/4s of the movie is shot in Black and White.It's strongly recommended for any Spielberg collection. Just know this movie isn't for everyone. It has swearing, violence, and some strong nudity. It's not for kids so I'd recommend it for ages 16 and up or at least someone mature enough to see a violent movie.It might offend certain Jews or those who are offended by Nazis as well.",Null,9,13,30 June 2006
The Incredibles," So incredible I wish it was longer.
","This is one of the best Pixar movies made yet. I remember waiting to see it in theaters when they showed the trailer of it when Finding Nemo was out.I kept counting the days for when it'll be release in the USA. On November 5th, 2004 I saw it on opening day.And it was incredible! I enjoyed every single minute of the movie.The incredibles is all about superheros. Taken place in a retro 50s vision of the future. Mr. Incredible is one of Metropolis's main superheros. He fights crime and saves the day with his super strength. Life was super right until he was sued by a suicide diver who didn't want to get saved. While other superheros are getting sued here and there. This lead to a conclusion where people don't want anymore superheros when crime seemed to decreased more than average. The super heroes now have to face the rest of their lives as their alter egos. With the government protecting their private lives.Mr. Incredible aka Bob Parr his alter ego is now settling down with a normal life with his wife Helen aka Elastagirl with a family to raise. They have a son, an infant son and a teenage daughter. They developed unique powers of their own but they were told not to use them at all or their secret will be reviewed.Bob Parr misses his hero days. He wishes he could be able to go out in public as Mr. Incredible again. And without any questions he's given an assignment by an unknown organization. Which their given him an opportunity to be a superhero again.Little does our hero know is that this organization is cooking up a crafty scheme involving all the supers.The Incredibles is an awesome movie hands down. The direction, animation, story, and plot are all great in my opion. Brad Bird who did Iron Giant, must be very proud of making this movie. I recommend it to those who liked Iron Giant or great action films.It's the first ever rated PG Pixar movie. For Action Violence and non-bloody fights. It's not gory so it should be OK for a kid to watch it. Just don't expect it to be a Family Safe Toy Story movie. Cause this is way different from Toy Story.",Null,0,0,17 April 2006
The Elephant Man," A movie everyone should see.
","I never heard of this movie till 2006.And I'm surprised I never did before. This movie is very moving and very under rated.Elephant man takes place in England during the late 1800s. A surgeon portrayed by Anthony Hopkins finds a sideshow featuring many freaks. But one of them caught the surgeons attention. The Elephant Man, a deformed human born with an unbearable face that made him inhuman.At first you'd suspect he's an abnormal monster that should be killed. But deep down he is a sensitive man named John Merdick, 21, and very well educated.Over the years he's been living it rough with his condition. He's been beaten and treated badly ever since he joined the sideshow. John only wishes he can walk in daylight with everyone else. The surgeon does not find John to be a freak of nature. So he gives him care at the hospital he works at. Only problem is John is incurable. So it's merely impossible to change his face no mater how professional a surgeon can be.With a bit of hope and care, people of England will soon see John Mereith as a Human like them.This movie has a great morale to it. And it will change the way you think of people with deformed features. Just because of their looks doesn't mean they're not human. If you get to know them more you'd find out what they're really like. Because I'm sure you'd feel the same way if you were in their shoes and face the same music they do 24/7.This movie deserves more and wish it was more well known to the public. I'd put it in any greatest drama list. It's worth seeing for those who haven't seen it or aren't familiar with the story of John Merdick.

So Shrek, Donkey, & Puss N Boots head out on a journey to find Artie and convince him that he's going to be the new king of Far Far Away. Besides that Shrek was asked by Fiona about how great it be if they'd start a family. He of course isn't too found of being a father as ogre babies are more rampaging than regular babies. And keeps having nightmares about it during the journey.Meanwhile Prince Charming, has been a laughing stock for what had happened in the previous film. For that he goes to the Poison Apple to cheer up all the fairytale villains that there's still hope in getting their own 'happiley ever after'. Will Shrek be able to over come his fear in becoming a father? Will Artie successfully become king? And will Charming be stopped for his plot to take over Far Far Away? For only being the third installment, Shrek the Third contains the usual and running gags, copyrighted music, and in jokes. However it feels much different than the first 2 as the opening and closing of it are made differently. I like how they used some ideas that weren't thought up in the previous 2, as well as more background character to spot throughout the movie. The downside is it's not above or the same as the first 2. As some of the scenes are obvious and a few that can be seen a mile away. I guarantee that there'll be more 3 funny scenes in the movie.But overall it's either a you like it or you don't like it movie.

Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," No doubt it's a Miyazaki Classic!
","This movie has been around for like 20 years and I just saw it for the first time ever a few weeks ago. I knew I was expecting a great movie cause it's made by none other than THE Hayao Miyazaki.I was blown away when I watched it, the entire movie was excellent. The characters, animation, and story are all great. Plus the voice acting for the English Debut is great. Alison Lohman is a good choice as Nausicaa. Patrick Stewart was suitable for his role as Yuppa. Uma Thurman(not a fan of her) but she was great as Kushana. Chris Sarandon as Kurotawa a perfect choice. Mark Hamill even got to do a role in the movie, not a big part as the Pejite Mayor, but still a good part.Some of the music is a bit 80s like, but this was the first movie Joe Hisashi teamed up with Miyazaki. His composing was still great back then and still great for Miyazkai's recent films.If you like Princess Mononoke, you might see about checking this one out. Has the same type of plot which contains Human Vs. Nature related story. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is now one of my personal favorites next to Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, Porco Rosso, and Totoro.I give it an 8/10. Once you see it you'll know why it's such a great movie. If you want to see more of the series I suggest buying the manga it's based off of. They're made and drawn by Miyazaki himself so keep an eye out for them.",Null,2,3,11 March 2005
Transformers," Great live action film for all time and new comer fans alike.
","I remember Transformers being a big series back in the 90s. I wasn't a huge fan of it, but I remember the cartoon being a cool franchise which still is today.I first heard of this movie as far back as 2005. And found it to be cool for a new live action movie being made for the first time ever for the Transformers series. Even though I was entirely familiar with the series background, I read some history and story lines on the internet before seeing the big picture.Eons ago on the planet Cybertron, lived a population of different life forms. Machines that have advanced into intelligent beings and formed a community on the hi-tech planet. Two sides were made: Autobots & Decepticons. The Autobots want peace and prosperity. While the Decepticons want communism and terror. Despite both sides thinking differently, they start their own war. One day a cube which is said to be the source of all their power went crashing on Earth. And it won't be found until a certain 'Day of Awakening' occurs when either sides try to get their hands on the cube first.And it was cool, every thing to make this movie a reality was more than amazing. With today's special effects, creating the robots in a live action film is accomplish-able and would of been impossible to do a decade ago. Every big franchise gets a movie like this one. And it was about time Transformers gets revised with a blockbuster hit.There wasn't anything disappointing or boring about the movie in my opinion. Just a lot of the screen time is spent by the secondary characters than the robots themselves. A few changes made for the movie for obvious reasons. Including making both the Autobots and Decepticons look more machine like than their cartoon appearances. And there's so much detail when you look at them in the movie. I'm not an expert in cars, but I do find the transforming sequences to be believable.Overrall this movie should please both the old time and new comer fans of the series. And it's going to get it's own sequel which is being predicted to be bigger than this one itself.",Null,0,3,14 November 2007

Let's say the plot to it is similar to the Grinch only with more Gothic humor to it.It involves an intro to a place where holidays originated from. Each door leads to a certain holiday, this one focuses on Halloween and Christmas. The leader of Halloween Town is Jack Skellington aka Pumpkin King. He's the town hero/favorite. He does the honor of leading and making the Holiday as great as it could be.But he's been doing from year after year, that he's tired of doing the same old thing.

Till he spots the XMas door which caught his attention and is willing to see what's in it.He goes in and before he knows it, he's in a different land which amazed him and wants to know what it is by examining the way it's celebrated and done, but ends up stealing it for himself and Halloween Town to create their own XMas.This is a one of kind film to see. It's all done with Stop Motion animation. Story written by filmmaker Tim Burton. Contains numerous and memorable characters and songs to admire.Made a lot of merchandise out of it too.

After they spend sometime together, they both went back to the swamp where they got a message from a messenger that Fiona's parents would love to see her and her husband(who they presume is Prince Charming). Shrek doesn't want to go while Fiona insists that Shrek needs to at least meet her parents if he wants to be part of the family.After a long argument short, they packed up for their trip to the kingdom of 'Far Far Away'.

And he's planning to be made as the top criminal in the whole city. By creating terror and committing crimes that no other criminals were able to do. Batman is on the pursuit to bring this insane clown down to justice.Plot: Highly well written for any existing comic book movie. Not only did it feature some great action sequences but it also features the overall best car chase and crime related scenes in any comic book film.Acting: The Joker steals the spotlight of this movie. And is therefore given the credit for the best acting. To think there could be someone other than Jack Nicohlson who can pull off a good performance. Not saying that Jack's role as the joker was bad or anything like that. But I like Heath's role in this film more than his role in Broke Back.Visuals: All perfect for this film. The explosions and bat radar special effects are all suitable for this film.Overall: This a movie in which all Batman and non-Batman fans can enjoy. It's also the only superhero movie to ever be on the top 10 movies of all time list.Years from now this movie will remain as a classic. This is the movie Heath Ledger will be remembered best as.

","This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back 10 years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies.Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only 7 when I first watched it in theaters).The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like 'Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc.' The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him.Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a 'Buzz Lightyear' action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys.Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more.I give it an 8/10 perfect movie for the whole family to watch.",Null,0,0,1 October 2005
Singin' in the Rain," Well at least it's original.
",Singin in the Rain is more than just a guy who enjoys singing in a rain.It's a story about 2 long time friends wanting to become successful musicians but couldn't get anywhere with their act.Eventually they make to motion picture business in Hollywood slowly till they make it big to everyone else in Hollywood.Taken place when movies were still silent the first sound picture was introduce and stunned many people.One of our leading characters discovers a young women with an incredible voice who can really make it to motion pictures.This movie isn't too bad for a musical. Some of the songs are good. And I heard it had good potential back in 1952. It's very clean and not a bad choice for a family movie night.,Null,0,1,26 June 2006
Toy Story 2," The 3rd Pixar Film and a perfect Sequel
","This is the sequel to the famous Toy Story movie. It was released in theaters 4 years after the first. And 1 year after A Bug's Life.Not only is it Pixar's first sequel but it was also a big hit back in 1999. It received more money at the box office than the first. And was given an Award for best Sequel and best Aniamtion.Anyways story continues when it's like a year after what happened in the previous one. It has the original voice talents from the original, including Tim Allen and Tom Hanks as the 2 main characters.The designs of the characters are similar to the previous Toy Story film, only with some improvements on the extra characters in the backgrounds, and good detail involving dust particles on a book self.It starts with Woody looking forward to cowboy camp with Andy, his owner. But didn't go when his arm got a torn a little. Woody felt bad that he didn't go with his owner.Sometime later when he saved a toy from being sold at a yard sale, he's been spotted by a Toy Collector, Al who is interested in him. Andy Mom refused to sell him Woody, so Al managed to steal Woody when Andy's mom is distracted by an accident he caused, and took off with Woody.Now Buzz Lightyear and the Other Toy must hunt down and find Woody before Andy gets back from cowboy camp.This movie is great and never gets boring. I enjoyed a little more than Toy Story 1, but I still like the original, just this one has more funny parts to it. It even introduces some new toys, and bigger locations.Those who liked the original will like this one also. If you heard bad reviews about this movie, ignore them cause this is one of those rare sequels that are good for a change.",Null,1,2,24 October 2005
Saw," Only if you like watching people kill each other.
","Here's another horror flick I didn't like. And I'm glad I didn't waisted my money on this sh*t.Saw is about 2 guys trapped in a bathroom, chained to the walls who are both involved in the same crime about some twisted dude who goes by the name of Jigsaw.Doesn't kill people by himself, he forces his victims to kill each other or themselves without a choice.We learn more about the 2 dudes locked in a bathroom as they figure out what to do before 6 am.Eventually they go crazy and try to force their way out of the chains their in. And find out who this Jigsaw dude really is. At the end it gets really bazaar once you know who he is.It's a twisted plot and story. But it's not my kind of movie. My version of this movie would be different. Cary Elwes is cool but not his best role.If you're into horror/twisted movies you might like it. Cause a non-horror fan like me didn't enjoyed it too much.",Null,2,3,23 April 2006

A Clockwork Orange," Twisted and interesting to watch.
","This movie is done by Kubrcik himself, the same dude who did '2001: Space Odyssey'.Unlike the other works I've seen him did so far. Clockwork Orange is a solid adult movie.Taken place in a Retro Future in Great Britain. Gangs roam the streets, violence and rapping is a common crime in this twisted future.Alex is a leader of one gang who like to club other gangs and hobos. Their specialty is going to someone's home and rape an unexpected woman.It's all fun and games for Alex and his buds to walk around the neighborhood and spend sometime at the Milk Bar. But Alex's crimes and perverted behavior will change once he gets caught.Clockwork Orange is a different kind of movie. It has a lot of sympathy music and nice locations in Britain. I've seen many adult movies with nudity in it. But I have to say this is the first movie I've seen with a lot of it. So in other words it's a Solid R movie and not just your average R flick.Stanley Kubrick fans or fans of Strange and unusual films might like this one. Please know that this is for Mature Audiences. It has language, Strong Nudity, rapping scenes, and suggestive images.So if you're mature enough to see naked women or at least aloud to see an R movie then it should be safe to see this movie without any trouble what so ever.",Null,0,1,2 May 2006
The Fly," Average B rated movie from the 80s.

After many tests, and failures, the invention finally succeeded, the scientist then tested it on himself, but didn't know that a fly accompanied with him on the way.And soon he'll start to mutate into a half man and half fly creature.This movie isn't too bad, just doesn't rank as a great Sci-Fi film. I don't mind seeing it again, just it's not a keeper for me. If the flow of the story and ending was improved then I'd consider it a classic.The good side is it has good special effects for it's time.

Rocky," Best Boxing Movie ever!
","I didn't see this movie till last year ago.I've heard a lot about this movie, and decided to check it out. And it was a well written and well thought up movie.Rocky is about an Italian/American born in Philledelphia. An underdog boxer who's only fought other underdog boxers. Rocky Balboa lives in the run down side of the city, and makes money by the fights he's been and working for a loan shark at the docks.He never went up against a professional boxer. Right until Heavy Weight Champ, Apollo Creed has offered Rocky to fight him on New Years Day, that'll surely give him the chance of a life time. So Rocky now trains with all he's got with the help of his trainer, Mick and the support of Adrian, the woman he loves. This will make it a million to one shot fight for the least suspected challenger.I'm not into boxing, but you got to admit that this is a great movie. From the beginning to end, you'll root for Rocky as if you were watching an actual boxing match. The acting is great, the story is inspiring, and the characters are memorable. No wonder this movie was highly acclaimed when it first came out in the 70s.I highly recommend to the Stalone Fans and Die Hard Boxing Fans alike.",Null,0,1,11 December 2006

","After Rocky won the title of Heavy Weight Boxing, he's gain fame, fortune, and a living out of boxing. Over the years he's been in car ads, magazine covers, and meeting famous celebrities. Life was good for the Italian Stallone.However a ruthless Black Boxer name Clubber Lang, was jealous and outraged that rocky has all the fame and he doesn't. So he comes around and challenges Rocky to a one on one fight. Eventually Rocky goes up against the loud mouth challenger. But Mick did at all want to be involved with this fight in the first place.Unfortunately the fight didn't last like the way it should. And Rocky feels as if his winning streak has gone down hill. Luckily Apollo has seen the whole thing and offers Rocky some help on regaining the title. And in order to do that, he'll need to challenge Clubber for a rematch, and Apollo will teach Rocky some boxing techniques that he's never mastered before.But will Rocky be able to beat someone who's more ruthless than Creed himself? This is a worthy sequel of the Rocky Series. What i like the most about it is, Apollo and Rocky are now close friends in this one than arch rivals from the previous 2. It has the same theme as the previous 2, and still has the style that Stalone provided in the series. Fans of the first 2 might like this one. But depending on one's own opinion.",Null,1,2,16 December 2006
Castle in the Sky," A Fantastic Film from THE Hayao Miyazaki
","This movie is Fantastic and breathe taking at the same time. Castle in the Sky is one of my 5 top personal favorites of Miyazaki's films.The best thing about this movie is that it's taken place in a world containing Aircraft machines of all kinds. This film shows how Miyazaki likes flying machines. It's an old anime film, but it's very well animated for an old movie.The animation, story, background, characters, and voice talents are all great. It's a blend of Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-fi, Comedy, and Drama all in one. The voice overs for the English version is very amusing, Mark Hamil is excellent with his role as the main villain Col. Musca. Jim Cumming(Famous Voice actor) plays a General, not a common role but he's just great with the part.The entire movie is all great from beginning to the end. Many of Miyazaki's films don't often have a good vs. bad related story. This movie how ever is like one of his only ones containing an actually villain, and this movie's villain is a cool one too.I give it 8/10, I recommend buying or renting the movie. It's suitable for Ages 8 and up.",Null,4,5,12 March 2005
It's a Wonderful Life," A classic everyone should know about.

He feels as if his life is falling apart. On X-Mas eve he thinks the world would be better off without him.When all seemed hopeless. A man named Clarence who is said to be a guardian Angel will help him change his way of thinking.Unlike other holiday movies, this one is one of those feel good movies and has a great moral to it. That every person who fails deserves a second chance.I think every person should know what this movie is. If you haven't seen it yet, do so, cause this is a must see classic. And it be a perfect movie for the whole family to watch.There's nothing too offending in the movie. No swearing, some drinking scenes, non-brutal fights, and I think it's perfectly fine for the kids to watch. Just to let you know that this movie is long and has some long scenes too.",Null,3,6,3 June 2006

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A nutshell review on this summer's talked about sequel.
","Transformers 2 has had a lot to offer. Including the usage of more Autobots and Decepticons than the first one had to offer. As well as a continuing story from what was left off in the previous installment.In the sequel, the Autobots have form alliance with the U.S. military in tracking down the remaining Decepticons that are wandering around parts of the world. While Sam is trying to keep his involvement with Optimus to a minimum by attending college, however after encountering a piece of the all spark from the first movie. A great deal of information had raced through his own head, and Sam ends up writing symbols of a code to something that the Decepticons are interested in getting hold of. Sam who tries his hardest to live a normal college life finds himself involve with the Autobots saving the planet yet again.This sequel was slightly better than the first one, but it didn't get where it was suppose to in surpassing the original. One would think that Michael Bay and the rest of the film team would be able to know what the old and new fans of the franchise want to see in a Transformers movie. The only pet peeve about this movie was the scenes that weren't necessary for the story itself, most the ones that involved the humans. While there's so much they could of added for this movie. Maybe giving some more screen time for most of the Transformers or more scenes involving Decepticon hunting.The only reason why I gave this movie an 8/10 was cause of the usage of more transformers than the other one and the transformer battles which saved the movie from being bad. I would give it a 9/10 if they took out the unneeded parts of the movie and more screen time on the Transformer's side of the movie.There's always a chance for the third installment to be better than this one. But let's hope they'll learn their pet peeves and know what to include for the next sequel. My suggestion is include a battle royal of at least a hundred Autobots and Decepticons fight against one another, that's what I'd like to see for a third installment, cause what would be more entertaining than watching all of your favorite transformers having their own role in the field of battle.",Null,8,13,2 July 2009
War of the Worlds," Even Spielberg isn't too perfect with remakes.
","I just rented this movie recently. I'm familiar with the story, so I knew what it's about. Only thing is this movie seems 100% different from it's original content.It starts with a narration like in the original W.O.T.W. about Mars planning to invade earth. Ray, a family man who works at the docks. Has a slacker son, and a daughter. He was an ordinary father till one day when an unusual storm occurred and lighting struck more than twice on the same spot. Ray and the locals went to investigate the spot. Right until the ground started to crumble and a large alien machine came out of the ground. It was gigantic, with tripod legs and tentacles. With a large scourging raw, it starts to disintegrate every living thing there is.And Ray starts running for his life, and do all he can to protect his family and run as far as they can from the invaders.Sadly this remake fails to be as thrilling as the original story it was based off of. I don't have the heart to place it in the category of 'Best Sci-Fi films'. But more worthy to be in the 'Less Admirible but made fun of Remakes' section right next to 'Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes' and 'Poseidon (2006)'.I completely related this movie to Poseidon. As they're both remakes of a successful film, both modernized, both have flaws, and both have misguided directions in the script.Besides this movie being a less lovable remake. It does have a good use of special effects. Just the flow of the story and differences is what the problem is. I've only seen a handful of Tom Cruise's films, but I can tell you that he's only done an OK job in this movie. I think the story could of worked out better if Cruise portrayed as a Scientist instead of a family man, so that way it would feel more close to the classic.Dakota Fanning is one of my favorite child-star actresses, but she's portrayed as the 'kid who seems to know more than the adults' part in this film. Those kind of roles can really make a film go down hill. Dakota did a much more impressive role in 'Hide and Seek' instead of this film.Finally the one thing this movie doesn't have is use of character pointer view of the action. In other words this film only focuses on one set of people. When it could of been more interesting to see at least 2 different sides of this story such as the National Guard or the other victims of this tragedy. If that was present in the movie, we could of seen more scenes of the Martians destroying buildings and mayhem. But since after the 9/11 thing, I guess they didn't think it be wise to show any of that. That I find understandable, but 'War of the Worlds' is a work of fiction.To wrap up my review on this remake. A lot of famous and less well known directors have had their successes and their mistakes in life. I've quite a few of other Spielberg films that were winners, and I know that this one ain't his best effort. Since 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' & 'E.T.' were grade A winners. Because they were original and not remakes of any form of cinema.This, Poseidon(2006), Burton's Planet of the Apes, and many other infamous remakes are prime examples of Hollywood's usage on making more money on redoing movies that were too great to get make overs. If World of the Wars was a little more faithful to it's original form, then it could of been as successful as Peter Jackson's 'King Kong'(as that one was a great remake cause it stick to it's originality and not modernizing).My advice is to rent it first before thinking about buying it without knowing whether you'd like it or not. It does have a few parts you'd find recognizable in the original. But I don't think the fans of the novel will be at all proud at how different they've made it. For me it's something to watch like every now and then to make fun of or to criticize over the flaws presented in the film.",Null,1,3,27 January 2007

Including sexual harassment, flirting and pulling off pranks on the anchorwoman who won't leave her desire in hosting the news. What will become of Ron Burgundy? I'm not remotely obsess with Will Ferrel. And this movie is an almost great comedy in my opinion. I almost thought this was based off of a true story right till it had a collection of slap stick humor.

Who is program to be female. It was love at first site, and Wall-E tries everything he could to show his feelings towards EVE and that he cares about her.No doubt, Pixar always succeeds in making a well received animated film. That's because the writers and producers spend a lot of time in making the story good and giving us viewers what we like to see.The plot and story is very well made. It's the first Pixar film to include actual live action scenes which are seen on the hologram screens and the first one to only include 1/2 of voice dialog while the rest is partly silent with the robot only making sound o fix to talk.The visual effects and animation are superb. The details on the abandon earth and space are all solid grade A work. There's so much detail, it's one of those movies where you'd have to re-watch it to see what you over looked.Parodies, including the usual Pixar in-jokes from their other films. This one includes a good number of parodies from various Sci-Fi films next to some original stuff. Also you'll be seeing a musical scene form an actual old movie throughout the film cause it plays an important part for the Wall-E character.Overrall, I recommend this movie to anyone including Pixar and animation fans a like.

","This is Brad Bird's first directed animated film.I saw this movie in theaters back in 1999. And I was blown away by how nicely done this movie was made.It's taken place in the late 50s. The Cold War was still at large, Sputnik was still active in space and made millions of Americans fear about Nuke attacks from the Soviets.On one stormy night in the Atlantic Ocean a meteorite comes landing into the eye of the hurricane. Only this isn't a meteorite. It's a artificial giant made out of iron. A boat navigator spotted the giant at sea and couldn't believe his own eyes.Meanwhile in a small town in Maine.

Which later on he'll try to hunt down the unimaginable invader on earth. Little does he know that soon he'll be the luckiest kid on earth.Iron Giant is a one of a kind animated movie. Nothing compared to your average Disney movie. It's one of the best animated movies of the late 90s in my pointer view.

Because of that he lives alone. Right until a band of fairytale creatures came because they were forced off of their homes. Reason why is because of Prince name Lord Farquot who wants his kingdom of Dulock to expand more.Accompanied with a talking donkey, who is slightly annoying to Shrek.

He wants to marry Fiona so he can fulfill in becoming King of Dulock. Shrek agrees with this deal and is about to have more than a quest to fulfill. And Princess Fiona is more than your average princess.I didn't expected this movie to be a big success. But I got to admit, that it's a classic for a CGI. Besides the unique storytelling, and humor, the visuals and texture are all well done. PDI, who made the movie did an excellent job in adding so much detail in all of the backgrounds. Every time you'd watch this movie, you'll notice small bits you didn't notice from before.I also like the use of parodies and in jokes on Disney. The choices for the main characters are clever. Including Eddie Murphy making the movie funny as Donkey. And Mike Myers fits the role of Shrek so perfectly.If you like mild humor comedies with action, and fantasy.

A mysterious crop circle appears in the middle of the corn field.It was too perfectly done for it to be a prank.Mel's character at first thinks it's just done by a group of nerds who have no life or anything better to do.Eventually strange things happen. And more crop circles are shown everywhere in the world. It's said to be an end of the world.This movie isn't too perfect. It just has more suspense and less aliens. You only see an alien for 4 minutes worth in the movie. I dislike movies that don't show you what you want to see. The acting is a little dry. And the story needed some more work. Cause the ending was just blah once you see it you'll know what I mean.I know there's better Mel Gibson movies and 'Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind' have much more aliens than this one.",Null,0,3,17 June 2006
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Best movie you'll see for this Holiday Season.
","A story about two foxes, Mr. & Mrs. Fox who once had a living in stealing chickens from a farm. However after escaping from a trap, Mrs. Fox told her husband that she doesn't want to steal chickens anymore due to the risk of getting trap became higher than before. Mr. Fox ending up agreeing with his wife that he'll find a new line of work in order for them to start a family. Some years later, Mr. Fox is now a newspaper writer for a column that's not very well received in the paper. Mrs. Fox spends her time doing scenery paintings. They both ended up having a son who tries to become an athlete but is too short to be fitted for sports.Everything seem good for Mr. Fox & his family, only with the exception on his career as a newspaper writer and the fox hole they're living in. So he goes to a real estate agent to check out on a tree that is on sale. The reason being is that it's next door to three big time farms owned by Mr. Boggis, Bunce, & Bean. All three of the farmers don't tolerate with wild animals or carnivores that steal their profits. Mr. Fox asked his lawyer about it, but his lawyer says it's not wise to live next to three wildlife hating farmers. However Mr. Fox ignores his lawyer's advice and has his family move in. While keeping it a secret from his wife, he plots out three plans to steal from each of the three farmers their profits. As it's in a foxes's nature to steal chickens and anything else that's editable. However messing with these three farmers would mean trouble to Mr. Fox and anyone who's connected with him. The farmers on't rest until Mr. Fox is shot and stuffed with cotton. But pretty soon, the farmers will learn that you should never try to out smart a fox.I never read the book, but I gotta say I really enjoyed this movie. For Wes Anderson's first animated film, I love the idea of the whole film made in Stop Motion Animation instead of the now commonly done CGI. That's one of the reasons this movie stands out more than the recently released animated films. I also love the story, action, & character alike. I've seen Wes's other films so I knew this movie was going to have some great moments and at least one memorable quote. Just like what was presented in his previous films. Also it has an all star cast along with people who have worked with Wes in the past.If you're looking for an animated movie that looks better than Planet 51, then Fantastic Mr. Fox is the other choice. Cause this movie is something that both kids and adults will enjoy together. To me it's a movie I'll definitely watch again and again.",Null,0,1,29 November 2009
The Ringer," Not an everyday comedy to watch.
","The Ringer about a dude who's never received a first place trophy before. Wants to feel like a winner.At his job his custodian friend gets fired and offer him to be his local gardener.After an accident our main character has to find a way to receive some money. Because his friend is an immigrant and not having his own insurance.He contacted his own uncle to find a solution and the solution is Special Olympics. But in order to do that he must act like he's stupid like most of the competitors. He just needs to keep up with the act and make sure the champion Jesse doesn't win.The humor for this movie is rather dry. Plot to it is OK. Even if the main character is pretending to have mental problems. I have nothing against mental people, it's just that this wasn't my kind of movie.I suggest renting it first if you like senseless comedies.",Null,1,1,29 May 2006
The Sixth Sense," Overrated and not too entertaining.
","I so far dislike M. Night Shyamalan's works after seeing 'Signs' and 'Village'.I finally saw more of Sixth Sense, more like Six Cents in someone's pocket.About Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child physiologist portrayed by Bruce Willis who meets with Cole Sear, a kid in Philladelpha who is mentally challenged, and living with a single mother.Cole can also see the dead, in other words he can see ghosts walk around like regular people. And the dead sometimes don't know they're dead at all. This frightens him a lot, and makes his mother worry. And thinks he need serious help. While Dr. Crowe does all he can to help Cole out with his unexplainable power.I can't say I enjoyed it at all, I didn't expected it to be great or anything, since I hated the way Signs and Village were. I'm just saying that Sixth Sense is a movie that doesn't seem well done. it needed some more plot wholes to explain the stuff they didn't even bother to explain. Least it wasn't as confusing as that 'Village' movie which had so many flaws in it.Bruce Willis was the only actor I know in the entire movie, he was alright in this one, but he's done way better roles in other better films than this one.That and Cole is nothing compared to Danny from 'Shining' or the 'Omen' kid. In other words I give this film a 5 out of 10. I'll see about checking out the rest of M. Night Shyamalan, for my full opinion on the Indian Director.",Null,0,1,22 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The best sci-fi series of all time!
","Not only is this a unique Sci-fi Series, but it also changed the way movies are made. And it's one of the biggest Box Office hits at it's time.It has everything you'd find in an average Sci-fi film. including Robots, machines, aliens, different planets, advance technology, and cool looking spaceships.This is taken place in the middle of a war between this Rebel Group and the Empire(A communist/dictator like organization). Their Leader: Darth Vadar, who everyone fears throughout the Galaxy. The Rebels attend to defeat the Empire and restore peace to the Galaxy.Our story focuses on 2 Droids who travel to find a New Hope for the Rebel's struggle on winning the war. Till they find this young lad who might be the galaxy's key to peace and freedom....This movie has action, adventure, danger, and a grand cine max. The characters are memorable, this is unlike anything you'd experience from a movie. Star Wars: A New Hope is something to see again and again.And if you want to see what happened before this movie, you can always check out Star Wars Episodes 1,2 and 3. To know more about Darth Vadar's past.Anyways if you like Sci-fi, adventure, smart/strong women characters, funny droids, action, aliens, and cool technology then you'll love Star Wars.",Null,0,0,31 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Star Wars continues in this one of a kind sequel.
","This is the 5th Episode of Star Wars. It has a more dark twist than the previous one. It introduces some new faces and other planets.It's taken place 3 years after what happened in A New Hope.There's allot of suspense and unexpected surprises to see in this one.It even has a cool Bounty Hunter: Boba Fett. And a Jedi Master: Yoda who'll train Luke more in the ways of the force.Those who like A New hope will like this one as well.It's directed by a different director, but George Lucas still wrote it and involved in the movie itself.Empire Strikes Back is worth the time. I give it a 8/10",Null,0,1,4 September 2005
Aladdin," My all time favorite Disney Movie.
","This has been my personal favorite of the Disney works for many years.I was only a little kid when it first came out back in 1992.The one thing great about this Disney movie is it has just about everything great animation, story, action, comedy, musical, and romance all into one.It's all taken place in a Abrian Nights land. Where it focuses on a young lad named Aladin and his monkey Abu who spent their lives in the streets of the market place. Having to steal food to prevent themselves from getting hungry. Aladin wishes he didn't had to live in the poor life. And hopes for one day to be somewhere more luxury like.That might all come true once he enters the cave of wonders where he will find this lamp of a powerful Genie who can grant him the wishes Aladdin has.This is a great Disney movie. Those who like Disney films will like this one a lot. It's something worth seeing again and again.My Rate: 8/10",Null,1,2,26 October 2005
Gladiator," Most Graphic movie ever.
","Gladiator is a obviously about a Gladiator named Maximus the Mighty.He became one after he escaped his execution.Being a Gladitator is a very dangerous job.It's a game of survival and death. If you survive then you receive more credit as a Gladitator, if you die then you get a reservation at the morgue.Maximus hopes to one day be free from being a Gladitator.This movie is OK. Not saying it's bad, just expected better.It's downright violent and graphic. So those who can with stand strong violence can be able to see this. I wouldn't recommend it to younger viewers or people who fear the sight of blood.",Null,0,1,1 May 2006
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Best one yet
","This one is my favorite Indiana Jones Movie so far.It takes place 2 years after Raiders of the Lost Ark, 1938.After recovering a Golden Cross, Indy is given another job. This time it involves the Holy Grail that was once used by Christ himself.Indy's father, Prof Henry Jones Sr. had studied the legend and possible directions in finding the Grail. A package was delivered to Jones which had his father's diary in it with all the notes on the Holy Grail. Indy went to his dad's house he finds out that his dad is no where to be found.So now with some info from the package that his father is in Austria. Indy packs his things and heads for Europe to locate his dad and figure out the where abouts of the Holy Grail.I like this one a lot, because it has action and good stuff you wouldn't find in the other 2 Indy movies.It has more Nazis in it than Raiders of the Lost Ark.Highly recommended to the Indiana Jones fans.",Null,0,0,4 May 2006
Shark Tale," Finding Nemo was better than this.
","I'm so glad I didn't waisted my money on this flick. It didn't look too good to see in the first place.A story about a Tongue Scrubbing Fish wanted to be a somebody. And Ends up being famous after the Aqua creatures think he killed a Shark.The only thing wrong about this film is it's unoriginal. And doesn't have much funny parts to it. I only laughed for less than a minute.I wish they'd improve on the story as well to make it a little better. But I'm not to crazy about Will Smith's films.Yes, this film is disappointing in it's own way. I mean Finding Nemo was a little more original and has more humor to it. I rather watch that than this.Sharktales is only worth seeing once and awhile. If you like Will Smith you'll enjoy the movie, but I won't guarantee that's it's something to see for other people.",Null,0,3,25 October 2005
The Birds," A good suspense movie.
","This is one of Hitchcock's(director of the all time classic Physco) most memorable movies.Birds is not dought all about Birds. They live along side with us humans and mean us no harm. But what would happen if they start to take advantage on the human race? You might find it silly for a sparrow or a crow to be viscous, but it won't be silly once you see them attack you without any warning what so ever.After you see this movie you'll change your view of the common bird you'd see in the sky or on a branch.Hitchcock did a great job on making this film to be suspenseful and thrilling at the same time. It's amazing they were able to do this sort of movie way before computers were in use for filming.I recommend it to the Hitchcock fans or people that like alternate/usual realities.",Null,2,3,3 May 2006
Princess Mononoke," Another good film of Miyazaki's works
","This movie which is one of Miyazaki's longest and most challenging anime film he's ever done. It's his first PG-13 film. While allot of his other films are PG or sometimes G. The animation and story line is very well made and planned out. I didn't see it in theaters when it came out in the US of 1999. I first heard of it at my Jr. high school, got the DVD of it later on when I learned more of Miyazkai's films. It's one of those films were at first it seem OK, but as you keep watching it it gets better every time it's viewed. Not in my personal favorites but it's definitely a fine piece of work by Miyazaki himself. I advice it to keep it away from younger viewers cause it's very violent. So it's suitable for like 13 and up.I give it 7.5/10",Null,2,3,13 March 2005
Dodgeball," Neither is it great and neither does it suck.
","This isn't my kind of movie so I might as well review it.Dodgeball is about 2 different GYMs one is an Average Joe GYM and the other is a much more cleaner and high tech GYM.When the Average Joe GYM is about to get bankrupt they must find a way to raise money to save the gym.They thought up of everything till they got it, Dodgeball. Not the old school game you'd find at school, but an actual sport in this movie.If they train hard they'll be able to win the prize money at the tournament. But when the rival GYM competes they're about to be in a world of hurt.This movie was OK. Had some funny parts, but can't say it's hilarious. Perhaps it's cause I'm not a huge Ben Stiller fan. But the Die hard Ben Stiller fans might like this movie.",Null,0,1,27 May 2006
