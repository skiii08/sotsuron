Howl's Moving Castle," Oh gee Hauru no Ugoku Shiro is AMAZING!
","I love this movie, especially since Miyazaki made it. He brought us so many classics, and Howl is just another one of them. The way Hayao Myazaki did the movie-- the characters, the settings, everything--!-- is so beautiful. At the intense war sequence, I found myself so immersed with the movie what my body was leaning towards the movie screen and i was almost falling off my seat! This movie makes you feel like you are inside the hat shop, you are in the wastelands, you are inside howl's castle, you are walking on air, everything that makes the movie special! I truly believe that this movie is worth spending a few dollars to watch. I strongly advise you to watch this movie if you are a Miyazaki fan, a fantasy fan, an anime fan or all of them!",Null,2,3,19 July 2005
