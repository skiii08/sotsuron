","I liked this film, but not for the same reasons most people did.I liked it because it fits in the series and doesn't stand out as bigger, badder, better. if it DID stand out, people would feel pretty lame watching them in order. A slam bang first part and then the film gradually get tamer. But any real problems with the script lie solely in the fact that Lucas has not written a screenplay since the original Star Wars. (He only wrote Empire and Jedi's stories, not the screenplays) His directing/writing style are definitely out of the 70's and most audiences don't really want a rather slow paced film anymore. Character development was no worse than in any other Star Wars film. I mean, did we get to know Liam Neeson's character any better than we did Lando Calrissian ? Or was Darth Maul any better/worse of a bad guy than Boba Fett ? Yet, I clearly remember seeing entire websites devoted to these very same characters that have about 15 minutes total screentime in the entire second triology.I think the deeper reason why people don't like this film is that nobody is six anymore, and we just can't feel the same sense of wonder we did watching the original triology.",Null,0,0,1 June 1999
