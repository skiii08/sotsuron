The Mask," This movie is SSSSSSSSMMMMMOOOKIN!
",This movie is very entertaining and hilarious! If you have kids that like Jim Carrey they will love This one.Peter Greene played a good role(the villain like always)and Cameron Diaz was good also..You gotta love both of them in The Mask.There isnt a part in the movie that you dont laugh at.It is funny all the way through!It is a great movie to watch when your bored and looking for a good laugh.The Jack Russel dog is so cute! I give it a 10/10*,Null,0,0,1 October 2003
Pulp Fiction," Very impressive!
","First of all Idonley (Castro Valley, California) Zed played a ''security guard'' slightly different from a  police officer...I do agree it was strange him showing up on a fantasy chopper though..Overall I loved this movie! This movie would'nt have made it if it was'nt for Samuel L. Jackson!
