The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," A tale like no other ***Spoilers***
","Cinema--it is said or more accurately theorized--was originally intended as a way to create an experience that can be shared by all. However, while watching this film for the first time, and the many times i've experienced it since, i've felt, like almost all the characters in this picture, a profound sense of loss and loneliness.An absolute magical exploration on the duality and also the polarity of identical strangers, The double life of Veronique is a film you MUST watch very closely and pay strict attention to. Every scene of this film, in some respect, matches other scenes to come. You'll have to pay attention to subtle clues and details as well as the metaphorical film language to notice them. Fear not! THIS isn't some kind of intellectual thinking persons picture. HOWEVER some profound questions are raised here about the very existence of SELF as well as the definition or what we define as human experience.There isn't much you can say about this film that hasn't already been said and if you've never heard it said please allow me to say it: This is one of the greatest films ever made and I strongly recommend watching this film alone. Why alone? Perhaps this is odd to say but the loneliness that haunts this film is surprisingly comforting. Only the magician (Krystoff Keislowski, Director) knows what he intended for the viewer when he made this. For the true answer go ahead and drift into the unique world that this film offers and allow yourself to be a part of cinema's greatest lullaby.",10,16,23,9 October 2002
Dark City," Matisse vs. Rockwell
","In no way am I comparing Alex Proyas(director of Dark City) to painter Henri Matisse nor am I comparing the Wachiowski brothers(directors of the MATRIX)to Norman Rockwell, however it is a bit confounding that most people missed the fact that the Matrix was an attempt by the brothers to recreate a work of art set before them by such a spectacular film. Like Rockwell, who longed to be taken seriously as a 'real painter' i.e. Matisse, The Matrix directors have only proven that plagiarism sometimes elevates that which has been plagiarized to the level of SUPERIORITY. Dark city is a superior work. If you like the Matrix you probably WILL NOT like dark city because let's face it, if you like Rockwell you've probably never even heard of Matisse. But whom do you think aspired to be whom? SEE DARK CITY. If only all films were this original!",Null,1,3,10 October 2002
