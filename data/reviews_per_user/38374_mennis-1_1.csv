Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," outstanding
","one of the best movies i've ever seen. right up there with the 'Godfather' and the 'Christmas that almost wasn't'. the movie really exposes people for who they really are. very eye opening and scary. especially the church scene. can't believe those wackos. best scene was the wrestling match. especially the censored part (unusually long black out, if you know what i mean)). Cohen is a genius. i could have sat through another 3 hours of his antics. can't wait for the DVD. should be a ton of extra footage. he may want to release another movie or separate DVD, like Anchor Man; the legend of Ron Burgandy. another great movie. especially the car scene, where Champ professes his love for Ron. see it.",10,1,21,8 November 2006
