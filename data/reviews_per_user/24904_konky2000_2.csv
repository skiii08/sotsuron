Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Great moments, but so much gabbing...
","Basically Quentin Tarantino is the Jimmy Page of our day. Page was a great musician and Led Zeppelin made some great songs, but that doesn't mean I have to praise his 30 minute 'Dazed and Confused' guitar solo. In a similar vein, it is not an insult to Tarantino's skills to say that Kill Bill 2 is about 30 minutes too long. There is genius to be found, but unfortunately this is one of those 'Dazed and Confused' moments where QT's self indulgence is trying the patience of fans such as myself.I could easily name 3-4 scenes that could be removed or shortened considerably -- scenes that added almost nothing to the story and served only to slow the pace of the film. The film itself might have been a dreadful bore if not for a sensationally choreographed showdown between Elle (Daryl Hannah) and the Bride (Uma). The scenes of Uma's kung-fu training were equally entertaining and were beautifully integrated into the story as a whole.Too many times, though, we are forced to sit through another one of Tarantino's signature 'Royale with Cheese' moments: meandering conversations about trivialities that are meant to draw out the tension by delaying the action scenes. Well, the technique is starting to feel like a schtick and just doesn't work so easily for me anymore.I am disappointed, because within 220 minutes that make up Kill Bill 1 & 2 are two sensational 88 minute films that coupled together would represent a great moment in stylish moviemaking. As it stands now, though, we have Tarantino standing on stage playing his triple necked guitar with a violin bow -- we are mightily impressed Tarantino, but just so you know, you had me already with the double necked guitar.",7,0,1,16 April 2004
Donnie Darko," Way overrated...
","I see a lot of people talking about how 'deep' this film is and that you have to watch it multiple times to truly appreciate the overwhelming depth and profoundness of it.  Actually, I don't feel I do have to watch it multiple times to 'get' the film.  What it is trying to say isn't really all that new, but says what it says with ambiguous plot points and slow-moving profound sounding dialogue, so a lot of people get fooled into thinking that it is some piece of high art.The fact is, you can pretty much deconstruct any movie made.  I remember a class at UC Berkeley where we did a fascinating analysis of 'Robo Cop,' for example.  The point is, the mere fact that this is a movie that some people like to pore over with a fine tooth comb looking for answers to the meaning of life, doesn't really say anything about the quality of the film itself.For me, the film featured an interesting style and had some very 'unique' elements, but in terms of editing, pacing and compelling dialogue, the film left a lot to be desired.",4,1,3,2 January 2004
