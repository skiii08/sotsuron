The Blair Witch Project," Original but average
","Original horror movie that was rewarded by a very good worldwide box office success although the movie itself is prevented from being better than average by it's rushed ending.Most audiences would want a more definitive conclution to a movie that tests said audiences patience thru very amateurish cinematography.The movie owes the audience a better ending than the one given.Only for big horror movie fans.Yes,it was scary but frustrating which in turn becomes irritating,thus causing a negative commentary during a review of this movie.A more defiitive ending could have really taken this movie to a higher level of respect.They did not have to show the 'entity' or 'witch' in keeping with the whole movie's style,but at least create a sequence of final scenes less questionable and full of blanks much like reading a very thick mystery paparback novel with no...........",7,0,2,29 October 2001
Alien 3," Watch this one last in the series
","Nightmarish horror sci-fi movie that has good all around production and accomplishes it's horrible objectives but comes off as too much of an ODDBALL in the overall direction and flow of the Alien series.To much psycho horror for it's own good.Sigourney Weaver does a great acting performance and so do the other cast actors.Watch Alien,Aliens then Alien Resurection first before checking this oddball out.Completely heads the opposite direction from the rest of the series and goes out of it's way to irritate the Aliens (second Alien) fans.Still worth a look though for the series big fans only to enjoy the alternative flow of this movie.Some minor plot holes here and there but nothing major.The real crime here really is the concerted effort of this movie to push your buttons to make you mad.Horror fans will like this one.Only for fans of the genre,and big fans of Sigourney Weaver......",Null,0,1,6 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good but should be better...
","Very good Sci-Fi movie that was created more for KIDS.This was done intentionaly by Lucas for reasons only known to him.Either that or some thing has happened to his brain because this film,as good as it was,is just done in such a way as if it was not created by the STAR WARS masterpiece creator GEORGE LUCAS we all know.It is a mystery indeed.The problem with this movie is that it OVER USED CGI.This computer special effects tech should only be used as a BACK UP to STANDARD SOLID PROPS.Maybe later on in the future when CGI is good enough to look MORE REALISTIC and LESS ANIMATED.But as of this writing,CGI is simply not ready to be highlighed in this way.The character JAR JAR BINKS was also too over used.An improvement that this movie has over it's earlier STAR WARS counterparts is the much better FIGHT SCENES.Even though this movie is much more inferior compared to the other earlier STAR WARS films,it still is good enough to rate as one of the greatest SCI-FI Movies of all time (top 20).Only for SCI-FI fans......",9,1,3,18 May 2002
Ali," How did Will do that?!!
","Incredible portrayal by Will Smith of one of the hardest roles to portray.....the unique and awesome persona of ALI in a SERIOUS DRAMA!After years and years of searching,finally we have found somebody who actually pulled it off well enough.And because of this,Will Smith should get the Oscar for best actor.Roles like this that are convincingly done by an actor is what the Oscar Best Actor award was made for.The production was very good although the movie's problem was it's script and screenplay which could have been slightly better by showing details we did not know before.Everything here has been told before so now we are only left to behold the magic of how well Will Smith portrays DA MAN.Some say the movie did not show enough.It was 3 hours long and covered so much!It's just that we want more of Ali.We want more of Smith's great portrayal.Just like the Star Wars and Godfather saga,one movie is not enough for Ali's many many great adventures and battles.A part 2 maybe to sneak in the rest of the stuff left out?Maybe next Christmas just like the promised next part to LORD OF THE RINGS.......",10,0,1,25 December 2001
Ghost," One of the best love movies
","Very good love comedy/drama with mainstream formula but very effective performances and production which tells a good story quite well.The special effects are also top notch and the attention to detail was taken at heart.May not be appreciated by non-spiritualists though for it's uncompromising theoloogical depictions and statements.This movie is so spiritually moving,it will bring tears to most BELIEVERS just as effectively as the closing moments did in the masterpiece 'It's A Wonderfull Life'.What keeps this movie from being a masterpiece like the above mentioned movie is the average cinematography,editing and script.Also,the lack of premium acting from Moore which is only adequate.Great performance from Swayze and Goldberg!For love story fans who are spiritualists and for big fans of the lead actors......",10,3,5,7 October 2001
Training Day," Very good but....
","Very good action drama movie that has a good realistic atmosphere with excellent acting.The movie how ever has an urealistic plot which really irritates a true street smart intellectual due to the movie's realistic presentation.The movie simply begs the street smart intellectual viewer to swallow too much plot weaknesses.The energy and entertaining quality of the movie however keeps the audience enthralled the whole time even as the story further recedes into a lower quality Hollywood ending and finally exposes itself to be not as great as it could have been.Still,the very good directing, cinematography and acting in this movie make it very highly recommended for all action drama fans......",10,2,13,13 October 2001
Mulan," Average Disney still rates a classc!
","This is by no means an average Disney effort but like I said,an average Disney still rates as an all time classic.Nobody can beat them in the family/animation genres.What makes this one average as opposed to it having been one of the best was the fact that I found the animations a little rough.They could have made more spectacular background effects.They had ancient China for scenery and that would give them leeway for much more spectacular scenery.I wanted more attention to detail in this area given the animation technology available today.Also,they could have made Mulan a little more stronger looking.More of a stronger look and personality could be done for women without compromising their female qualities.There are many amazon/warrior type gorgeous women and a lot  of them,contrary to stereotipical beliefs,are Asian too.How many chances does Disney have to focus a movie on east Asia.They should have been more responsible wih their portrayal of scenery and people of this great land in this regard.But other than this point,and given how many other things could have gone wrong,Disney once again did a bravo job.Not shying away from exotic cultures and taking on women's rights issues are very commendable and really educate the world's children.The little dragon stole the show too and I was laughing so hard!I forgive the producers regarding the music becouse good musical compositions are very very difficult to come by and you do not just create top quality music any time you want.Great music is very precious and people must realise this fact.So we must appreciate what ever great music we got from this movie(like 'Reflection').Creatng great music is very spur of the moment and pops up unpredictably.Ask pro composers and they will tell you.But other aspects like visual animation can very much be controlled big time.Particularly now when hand drawn art is backed up by computer animation technologies.Peace out......",10,2,3,23 October 2000
Wayne's World," Myers!Rock & Roll!Slapstick!
","Average slapstick comedy that caters to fans of the genre who also like the Saturday Night Live TV show routine and happen to enjoy Rock & Roll music.The characters are enjoyable but the production is below average.Everything rides on Myers talents here.Tia is fine and energetic but does not sing well enough, which can be irritating to true music ears.She does show strong charisma though which blends well with Myers here.If into this kind of genre,it's worth a look.This movie definitely propelled Myer's career......",6,1,3,3 December 2001
Unbreakable," Yet another modern misfire!
","Great idea.They could have had a classic here where in which the subject of stronger than usual individuals in our everyday reality (the best athletes,soldiers etc.) could have been explored and mirrored with that of the comic book genre writing.Oh the possibilities for that one!But they messed it up!If they wanted a movie that had Willis with paranormal qualities,they should have done this with more action.If they really wanted to make a movie basically for the plot twist in the end,they should not have indicated too blatantly that Willis had paranormal powers.They should have kept us guessing to the end although tend to keep the audience leaning toward the opinion that he MAY have powers,so this way,we can be fooled along with Willis and come to realise he is not as super as Jackson claimed he was.We were all carried away by the insane Jackson.Now that would have been more like it.But no!They showed us those very clear cut scenes of Willis displaying more than your run of the mill Michael Jordan abilities,keenly stating that Willis did indeed have paranormal superhuman abiities.No question about that fact.This mistake really watered down the intended 'realisation' plot twist in the end.Still entertaining though and the acting was superb.But it breaks my heart thinking of what this movie could have been like without that simple mistake.......",1,34,73,25 November 2000
Fight Club," Deep testosterone classic
","Very good movie aimed at male audience which is an action packed,little compromise,dark satirical comedy about going over the edge mentally.Seen thru the perspective of the lunatics,we are thoroughly taken on an adventure thru madness.To most men,this film is a great ride.Most of us know it is lunacy yet the film is very good in creating empathy for the main character's situation.Delve into the anti-social's mind and trip!Pitt is a great actor.See his performance in this one.Holywood can learn from this film.We need more like this......",10,0,1,26 August 2001
As Good as It Gets," Nicholson charm
",Average comedy drama with great performances by the lead actors.Nicholson shows he is still one of the best while inspiring Hunt and Kinnear to take it to the next level with their acting skills.Average story here but with great script and good screenplay.The movie dragged but Nicholson's charm keeps the audience's attention untill the end.Nicholson deserved winning the best actor OSCAR here and must be seen in this film by all his fans.Not for people who do not have a taste for a LIGHT comedy/drama flavor........,Null,0,0,3 September 2001
Shakespeare in Love," Good but over rated
","Good romance/comedy that has very good costumes and good cinematography.The production is above average in quality athough the story's credibility is difficult to swallow since it banks on the biography of true  historical characters doing very unlikely things.One particular sequence that destroys the films illusion is the too unlikely scene where in Shakespeare pours his heart out to his love Viola who is disguised as a man as they ride a small boat.Shakespeare does not know the man is Viola despite them facing up cose and face to face in the small boat and the disguise clearly is not good enough to hide the man's identity.The scene comes away as funny yet at the high price of losing quality writing credibility.The scene is flawed because most people would assume Shakespeare would be smarter than that.There are many such other scenes to this effect.A film that demands CREDIBILITY to get to a high level of over all quality will loose quality points with out it.Still,the movie is good for it's genre and a must see for all the genre's fans and fans of Shekespeare,15th century enthusiasts,and big fans of the lead actors,particularly Paltrow who is a surprise talent to watch out for.......",Null,0,1,12 November 2001
12 Monkeys," Over rated!
","Over rated movie!Not The worst I have seen but imdb 7.8 hell no!What is so original about this one?I predicted most of what was going on!Come on people (especially the ones who praised this movie to high heavens at the user comments portion.If it is the quality of the movie regarding the question of ones reality,it was weak there!I never ever seriously doubted that he was from the future man!Did any one?If any one seriously did that person who actually thought that is so naive!!!They praise it for being a thinkers movie.It does make you think BUT it is nothing deep at all.I should say it might be a dumb persons thinking movie.That is what it is!It is a movie for dumb people who feel like watching a movie that makes them think but is actually lightweight  enough so as not to leave that dumb person too far behind.If you want a real time travel thinking movie,watch TOTAL RECALL.How about BACK TO THE FUTURE (all 3).12 Monkeys had great acting.That much I can say.All the leading actors did their part and gave it their all.But the way the movie was done was wrong.The story,as predictable as it is,is not really that bad but the torturing style they did trying to be a modern Hitchcock movie ruined it.Peace out.......",1,16,73,23 July 2000
The Hustler," Highly over rated!!!
","This movie was highly over rated becouse it was slickly marketed and appealed to a wide variety of people.The acting was above average,Newman was over acting seemed forcing his performance,the budget was so obviously low that the sets looked like they were made out of plywood,the direction was just plain,the cinematography was plain and dry,and the black and white dehydrated the whole effort.Too bad becouse the story was above average and the performances of Scott and Gleason were superb.This was a slow,glorified tv movie done with wannabe noire cinematography but came out like a 1960's Twilight Zone tv show in quality.This was a superb marketing success though becouse I know it profitted all those involved in the movie,although to the trained eye who knows how to look past the hype,this movie is average at best.....",1,17,56,14 March 2001

","Good action drama movie that delivers all the basics the genre demands.Very good performance by Russell Crowe and sexy Kim Bassinger.A tag too long and drags due to too much dialogue but still manages to compensate with good action sequences.Nothing spectacular or original here so do not expect too much due to many genre fans over rating this movie.It's certainly no classic.The story demands a less Hollywood ending than the one presented here.Only for Noir action drama fans,police/crime action drama movies and big fans of the lead actors......",2,7,38,17 August 2002
X-Men," Good Superhero Movie
","Good Superhero action movie that introrduces the great things CGI can do for the genre.Tries to stay true to the comic but could have done better in this department.Also the ROGUE character was not well portrayed and some costumes could have been done better (like Wolverine and Magneto).Also,there was not enough minutes (90 min.) as this great comic book story needed more time to be told propery.Still,a good movie overall and a great teaser for the new things coming for this movie genre due to CGI technology.

Snatch," Well made street movie
",London underworld is featured in this well directed movie which is a classic due to it's uncompromising style and great performances.Not as good as PULP FICTION yet can be said to be on it's level in quality.For it's genre it is great.The only nitpicking that can be done about it is the complicated and unlikely plot which can be hard to follow due to the unapologetic and energetic pace of the film.It may take a second viewing to really follow the specifics of the story although the film can still be very well enjoyed without really knowing exactly what is going on and that is what the director intended.One with a good sense of humour will find themselves laughing without having the exact specifics of the story and characters.A general idea of the plot is more than enough for the viewer to have a ball watching the film as long as the genre is appreciated.That is the magic of this films style.Pitt was incredible.He ruly has my big respect now in seeing his performnce in this film.He may be the next James Dean if he keeps it up.Only for fans of action and gangster films........,9,1,1,21 August 2001
Over the Top," Bad directing
","This movie suffers from bad directing,bad screenplay and bad cinematography.It had promising plot and story for a Stallone vehicle though and he carried the movie well enough for it to rate an average family type film.Some of the songs in the soundtrack were good but most of the songs were terrible.Yup,Sly was left all alone in this one but it was an interesting peek into the world of pro arm wrestling.Watch this movie if you are a die hard fan of Stallone and that sport.....",10,1,6,27 July 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Good but IT'S THE WORST STAR WARS
","Very good SCI-FI movie BUT is the worst STAR WARS movie to date.It is even of lesser quality over all compared to THE PHANTOM MENACE.And this despite limiting Jar Jar Binks!The OVERT USE OF CGI which was the detriment of THE PHANTOM MENACE was done here once again.No adjustment here what so ever.In fact there was NOTHING NEW here.It was all blase blase been there done that stuff!And they re-cycled everything with LESS QUALITY!At least PHANTOM MENACE had many new dimensions to it.This one was just all cliche flash.The fight scenes in the PHANTOM MENACE was much better.The acting also over all deteriorated more here compared to THE PHANTOM MENACE.Very predictable script and screenplay.It all looked so rushed.No love was put into this what so ever by the producers.The whole movie was riding on the back of the GREAT STAR WARS SPIRIT and nothing else.CGI effects?Impressive but so was TOY STORY.Still over all,this movie is one of the TOP 20 GREATEST SCI-FI MOVIES ALL TIME.But in comparison to STAR WARS and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK,they are as far away from each other in quality as the MILKY WAY is to that GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY.Only for SCI-FI fans.......",1,1,4,19 May 2002

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A classic but....
","Very good fantasy movie that is so good,it is definitely as of now (Dec.2001) the greatest MAGIC AND DRAGONS fantasy movie all time,beating out LEGEND and WILLOW easily.I would also say that as of now,this movie is also the SECOND greatest CGI movie ever made right after EPISODE I:THE PHANTOM MENACE.Not because the CGI effects in THE PHANTOM MENACE was better,it is because AS A WHOLE overall,THE PHANTOM MENACE was still a better movie.And we all know that compared to the greatest films of all time,THE PHANTOM MENACE would not be found anywhere at the TOP 20. when I say this dear reader,I mean to say that as great a FANTASY MAGIC/DRAGON/CGI movie LORD OF THE RINGS is,it still is a long way from being even at the top 50 of the all time greatest movies.Why?The characters were dull!I did not care for the characters at all!Even the greatest character in the movie which happens to be the good old wizard hardly got a whimper out of me when he fell into a deep crevice inside the dwarf's mountain!I did not buy it because a few minutes before he was already defeated by the evil wizard(nicely played by CHRISTOPHER LEE) and got out of it unscratched.The second time around,his tragedy looked silly and something he might get out of again.Nothing compared to the chills I got when OBI-WAN was struck down by DARTH VADER in STAR WARS for example(a true big leagues movie).And also,the movie does not know whether to be cartoonish or hardcore(much like the mistake of RETURN OF THE JEDI).The battle scenes were incredible but then it has those silly Saturday morning cartoon scenes like when there was those scenes at the Elves territory as the good characters were forming the brotherhood of the ring.Those scenes were so amateurish in script and too dragged out as well.This movie was really helped by the improvements of CGI technology and also by the realistic,little compromise battle/combat sequences.Probably,the next installent will be even better.I hope so at least in the area of characterisation.Still this is one great fantasy movie that must not be missed by any fan of the genre.The CGI displayed here really excites me because I am sure it can only get better and better for the movie industry.......",1,2,12,25 December 2001
Cast Away," Tom Hanks saves it!
",To Hanks saves this movie from failing.This movie was created for a great movie actor and Tom Hanks did a very good job.No real suprises in this movie and we got exactly what it promised.The movie reminds us that anything can happen in life and our journey can take very unexpected turns anytime.It would do us a whole lot of good to keep this in mind so we may be better prepared mentally when such events happen to us.We must never expect our life journey to be predictable.We can only do our very best to achieve our goals but at the same time be constantly aware how easily events could cause very divergent paths to anywhere.The weak points are it's predictability and condescending start(Lenin's picture being taken down in Moscow for example)but it's weak points were not enough to ruin this movie.A near classic.Another touchdown for Hanks!,9,0,0,23 December 2000
Pitch Black," Not a bad B movie
","Fair warning to all who have not seen this one.First of all,this one is a B movie(low budget),and secondly,it is a blatant rip-off of the Alien classic series.But it would be nice indeed if more sci-fi B movies were made this way.This movie was done with PRIDE and love.Very good effort and the cinemtography was good.The main problem was the editing and the script.I recommend this one for forgiving sci-fi fans and to regular viewers who appreciate B action/ sci-fi efforts......",Null,0,0,30 October 2000

Face_Off," Not for intellectuals....
","This movie truly will challenge smart people to appreciate it's story.It will definitely sell to less intelligent action fans and that is the target audience of this movie anyway.Fast action and curiosity will keep it's target audience captivated and thrilled.Very hollywood formulaic.Very strong comic book and toned down cinematic style and for this particular style/action genre,it is good.BUT over all as an action movie,considering the opinions of true action connosiurs,this is a glamorised bad movie that rates slightly below average.The science is careless,the plot twists are very unbelievable,the action choreography is rediculous,and the acting is cartoonish.The movie just forces the more intelligent audience to believe in an innefective manner.Delivers in the action promise however and having two great movie stars in it saves the movie somewhat from becoming too much of a laughing stock.....",1,3,8,20 March 2001
Spider-Man," Good but could have been better!
","Good action sci-fi PG-13 movie that uses CGI effects very well to depict the famous superhero.Above average cinematography and directing.The screenplay was average and the script was below average.The movie banked too heavily on the heroes great costume and the outstanding special effects although for some reason,slacked off on the quality acting and depth.Due to this slacking off factor,comic book fans who expect a quality level as high as SUPERMAN (1979) will be let down.Do watch this one with an average movie expectation and it will deliver!Only for big action sci-fi fans and big fans of Web head.My major complaints are:1)actress who portrayed Mary Jane does not look like Mary Jane or even has the persona of the Mary Jane I know in the comic books 2)High School scenes are very un High School looking and comes off as cheap as a porno movie 3)the love story was very weak and intellectually insulting to the more smarter audience 4)Parker in the comic books was a very good scientist who acted nerdy but was a much better looking guy than the movie version Parker 5)Spidey has WEB SHOOTERS and does not create his own natural webbing 6)Uncle Ben actor was not good 7)the scene where Parker is bitten by Spider is weak 8)the movie music is weak 9)Green Goblin in movie is not Green Goblin I know 10)where is Gwen Stacy! 11)Bugle Building is not shaped like that! 12)Spidey is much funnier than was shown here 13)Goblin's/Defoe's lines were too shalow 14)non focus on Parker's scientific genius side makes his creation of Spidey's incredible costume weakThe movie got the very technical hard parts very well (Spidey costume,Spidey special effect movements,Spidey webbing,Goblin lanterns and hover craft,action sequences) but for some weird reason,was just plain careless with stuff that are sooooooo easy to deal with.The result is instead of a MASTERPIECE that could have been on par with SUPERMAN (1979) or STAR WARS (1977),we end up with a good summer popcorn movie that will collect dust as soon as the next good popcorn movie hype comes along.A masterpiece saga like SPIDER MAN deserves much more than that,even more so now that the CGI effects are here to do it right......",1,2,5,4 May 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Very Good PG-13 but....
","Very good comedy thriller movie that does not try to take itself seriously or try for any story depth.This movie was deliberately done in a PG-13 style which is ok BUT the story genre demands a grittier rated R style production.The acting was nothing intense at all as they seemed to just go on cruise control.Roberts showed a little more acting effort than the other main actors but it only made her seemed a little out of place.The last few scenes of the movie was also very messy.The movie producers really tried too hard to water this movie down a tag too much. This remake is definitely better than the wasted 1960 effort but I can only imagine if this newer version was done rated R style,with a little more depth and plot attention to detail in the mold of PULP FICTION or SNATCH.Still,if you are into Las Vegas setting comedies of are a big fan of any of the lead actors here and you don't mind your crime caper movies done in a PG-13 style,you will get your money's worth with this one........",10,0,0,8 December 2001

Legends of the Fall," Masterpiece and very under rated
","Masterpiece action drama film that has very good production and performances.The film is very under rated due to the symptom I call the 'Errol Flynn Syndrome' which is a prejudice against eccentric people who are very charming.It's a prejudice that is heaped upon great liberal/free spirited and charming people like Errol Flynn,Elvis 'The King' Presley,Muhammad 'The Greatest' Ali,John and Robert F. Kennedy,Bill Clinton,Marilyn Monroe,Elizabeth Taylor,Rock Hudson,Robert Redford,Bruce Lee,James Dean and the like.These icons of challenge to evolve that threaten the conservative mainstream.Well,Brad Pitt is the 1990's victim of this symptom.He is a great actor who likes portraying free spirit themed movies and thus gets a lot of more than the usual heat from critics.This film itself was giving a free spirited message.It's main character was somebody who wanted to be free and does not want to be bound by anything or any woman who will try to control him.Robert Redford had a masterpiece film with this same theme called JEREMIAH JOHNSON and to those who enjoyed this free spirit message of LEGENDS OF THE FALL,check out that Redford film.LEGENDS OF THE FALL is one of the top 200 greatest movies of all time and one of the top 20 greatest drama westerns of all time.Only for liberal minded drama western fans,and big fans of the lead actors......",9,4,6,2 August 2002

","The greatest CGI special effects (only in terms of CGI) film so far.The acting was superb and the movie was done with a lot of love put into it.BUT.....just like the first Lord Of The Rings,the characters were not well portrayed.If if the first Lord Of The Rings film we only had one great character in Wizard Gandarf The Gray, in this second installment,we have only have two great characters,namely Wizard Gandarf The White and (the all CGI character) Gollem.Fantastic CGI effects for Gollem!Puts Jar Jar Binks (of Phantom Menace and Attack Of The Clones) to shame.The story was also nothing spectacular.The fantastic battle/action sequences had to make up for the transitional storyline which was not grand at all.Color was not good.They should have made the cinematography more colorful to compliment the fantastic CGI effects.Granted the film was supposed to have a dark edge/mood,but the storyline and settings alone could provide that mood without making everything look almost black and white.All in all,this film is a Classic but not a Masterpiece and even falls short of being better than the first Lord Of The Rings due to that film having a better storyline.I realy expected the story to be better this time but it fell short in that category.But the CGI met my full expectations.INCREDIBLE BATTLE SEQUENCES!Still one of the best films all time (Classic) and I would easily place it in the Top 10 Sword And Sorcery Films All Time (as of this writing).Only for fans of Sword and Sorcery films,big CGI special effects movies and big fans of the lead actors.......",2,0,0,22 December 2002

Patton," Geaorge becomes Patton!
","What made this movie great was the performance of Scott,a great budget,ambition,great supporting effort by MaLden,and that great soundrack.But what is really irreplaceable here is the the eerily spiritual performance of Scott as he becomes that great warrior general.Although I must say that there were incredible flaws in the battle scenes that could not be overlooked.This is what destroyed the film.Many many battle scene choreograhies here were cartoonish and watered down for some reason although you can tell they were all well rehearsed and well budgeted.I believe it was some sort of marketing compromise to tone down the 'specifics' when it comes to the details of realistic fighting,focusing more on the realistics of the main characters historical actions.This makes this movie 'pop' for a wider market, but then the price is credibility with more descriminating,attention to detail buffs like me.Wrong war equipment here and there and childish battle sequences prevents this movie from being the greatest war and/or biography movie ever.It could have been.This movie still ranks as one of the top 20 war movies ever,and one of the top 10 biography movies ever,but far from the top 100 movies ever as a lot of over rating critics would like to believe.I would recommend this movie if you would like to be educated about who General Patton was,or a war movie fan,or a movie acting fan(to study Scott's performance).......",Null,0,1,23 March 2001

","Nice drug drama genre movie with better than average cinematography and adequate direction.Depps performance was as expected of him but shows nothing much more regarding whether his actng skils are improving.He does have more 'manly' look now which looks good for future roles he will be doing later on.Better than average supporting cast adds quality to the movie as well.The screenplay was also better than average BUT the genre demands a greater screenplay so as to elevate this movie into the next level occupied by movies such as 'Scarface' or 'Goodfellas'.The justification of it's makers is that this movie was intentionally made to have less action, but still the fact remains that the quality of the screenplay is still not as good as it should have been.I also do not like that porly executed scene where in which Depp confronts his best friend/drug confidant who has betrayed him.The sequences on those scenes were just poorly executed,with the cheesy gun pointing and over acting and the very poorly executed sequences that followed after that where Depp was being beaten up.  The whole beating looked so fake and amateurish.They should have re-shot those particular segments.I put the blame on the director for that one. Worth your viewing if you enjoy reality movies,drug-drama movies,or happen to be a Depp or Liotta fan.I also recommend this movie to teens and young adults to learn the movie's moral lesson regarding taking the short cut or devil's way to success.",9,2,4,9 April 2001
