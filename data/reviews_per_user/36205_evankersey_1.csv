10 Cloverfield Lane," Thin, Easily Reproducible.
","This movie was made because-a) Already a known brand. b) We can make 5 more after this one! c) It costs next to nothing to make. d) No matter how good the script is, people will go see it, there are aliens in it..BOO! e) Good actors will play the parts. f) JJ Abrams likes money. g) Can anyone say video game?Answer: All of the above!I'm sorry, but It's the same old psych thriller premise. The protagonist has been convinced they will be safer remaining under duress compared to whatever the alternative is. An hour of pretty run of the mill 'creepy guy time' passes. Big Ending/Reveal: The captor is uncovered as a murdering psychopath AND aliens had landed in an attempt to colonize Earth. So he was insane, but still telling the truth? WOW! Double Whammy!! Ensue alien chase/kill/escape scene. In the very end we see this was basically a pilot movie, opening up the option to spew out more. If you like movies that lack profundity and character development, grab your gas mask made out of a soda bottle and get ready to hold on!",3,2,6,12 April 2016
