10 Cloverfield Lane," Good plot, poor execution
","Agree with all sonofocelot said. I would add that the woman coming to the door when Winstead's character tried to escape ruined the rest of the movie for me. When I saw her she confirmed to me that Goodman's character was not deluded into thinking there was a disaster outside. All tension of the plot was lost for me, not to mention the ending.",4,0,1,13 March 2018
