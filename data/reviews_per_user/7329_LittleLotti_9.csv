Whip It," Underrated Movie Gold
","Drew Barrymore created a stunning film with Shauna Cross's script, and you would never know it was her first time directing. The characters and story are so well crafted and there's never a dull moment.
I love the way this movie feels nostalgic and makes you remember that time in your life where you're trying to figure out who you are, and you have that one best friend that gets you through the tough times. I'm impressed by the actresses' skating abilities and making this all look so natural to them. Marcia Gay Harden is total perfection as Bliss Cavendar's mother, bringing such a realness to her character, and Ellen Page and Alia Shawkat have realistic chemistry that pulls you into their friendship.
This isn't a raunchy movie and I find it totally enjoyable. I can watch this movie over and over and I never get sick of it - it's become a classic for sure!",8,4,4,23 February 2018
Hereditary," Surprised at how much I liked it
","I feel like 9 times out of 10, I absolutely loathe movies that are raved about by everyone else. I end up being disappointed or feel like I've been cheated, or can't possibly understand how anyone liked it. But I truly think Hereditary is a great movie that's chilling, intense, and full of surprises.The trailers don't give anything away and it's so important for a movie like this to be watched without knowing what's going to happen. Within the first half hour my jaw dropped and from there I had no idea what to expect. The film consistently had me asking what was going to happen. There were times where I was like, 'Really? This is happening now?' but I reserved judgement and decided to openly accept wherever this movie went.By the end, as with most horror movie endings, I felt like things went a little too bonkers for me, and I can see why some people would be disappointed. But I still think it was great if you have an open mind.This is a melodrama, so don't expect too much character development here. Toni Collette deserves an award for her performance, though. She is superbly talented. The rest of the cast was fantastic too.I don't typically watch horror movies because I get scared so easily but I felt like this is my kind of horror. No jump scares, just truly disturbing psychological horror, where I didn't feel totally confused at the end. It still had moments where I had to look away out of fear/dread. I can't wait to watch it again to catch everything I missed.Not for everyone, and very intense, but worth a watch.",7,0,1,3 January 2019
Memento," Definition of overrated
","I finally watched this after years of hearing how great it is. I've come to the conclusion that the only reason this movie is filmed 'backwards' so to speak, is because in chronological order it would be even more boring. No action, no suspense, nothing. I get the movie, but I don't get the hype.",4,4,9,27 March 2017
Green Room," Heart-pounding thriller
","Green Room was a white knuckle thrill ride for me. It takes hardly no time to really get started, and once it does the suspense barely lets up. This movie has the perfect cast, superb pacing, and characters you root for. It doesn't rely on gore or jump scares to get your heart pounding (although there are a couple instances where you can't help but be shocked). Each character feels like their own individual and they all seem like real people with genuine reactions to what's happening. This is great film making and I wish Hollywood was more into making movies like this. It was heartbreaking to see Anton Yelchin give such a great performance knowing he's gone; he had such talent and this film proves it. Green Room does an excellent job at making you wonder what's going to happen, who's going to make it out alive, and who is trustworthy. I love movies that use genuine human emotion to involve the viewer, and this is one of those movies.",6,2,5,31 May 2017
Spirited Away," BAFFLED at the hype that has surrounded this movie for almost two decades!
","I don't get it. I just don't get it.What is so great about this movie? There is virtually no plot or story, no interesting characters, and the main character is shrill and irritating.Sure, there are a handful of beautiful animations, but it's not enough to make up for a terrible story that drags on and on, going nowhere.People compare this to Alice in Wonderland which is insulting. This is just another overrated film that people keep praising because everyone else praises it.",3,2,9,19 March 2019
It Follows," Better than expected
","It Follows is one of my go-to horror movies that I never get tired of. It's not very scary but is creepy and suspenseful. From the very first scene you know there is something to be afraid of and I love how it kicks off the dread for the rest of the movie.While 'It' is passed along via sex, the movie never feels raunchy or gratuitous. Maika Monroe acts legitimately terrified which is probably what prevents this movie from ever seeming stupid. That's not to say there aren't a few disappointments. The last 20 or 30 minutes are a bit lackluster but I still enjoy the film as a whole.The direction, cinematography, and score of It Follows are superb; the 360 shots are used brilliantly to make you feel like danger can come from anywhere, and the music fits each scene so well. There's a very surreal undertone, like how in dreams things don't always fit together or make sense. It's a great way of subconsciously throwing you off. I'm a fan of subtle scares, creepy things you may not always notice on the first watch. In the opening scene you hear a screen door screech as a girl runs out, then off screen you hear it two more times, but see only one other person has exited from it. It's the subtle things like that that I personally love in horror movies. If you prefer jump scares or supernatural-looking monsters, this may not be for you. I recommend giving it a chance though.",7,0,0,3 November 2019
Finding Dory," I had high hopes
","As someone who adores Finding Nemo and has waited YEARS for a sequel, I must say I am disappointed. Finding Dory definitely has a sequel feel to it. This didn't feel like a story that is worth a thirteen year wait. There are certainly cute and funny moments, but nothing solid enough to become a favorite. I've seen Finding Nemo so many times, but Dory is one I'll probably never watch again unless it's with my nephew or something. I didn't feel like this was a Pixar movie for all ages; it seemed more appropriate for younger audiences (I'm 24). As much as I hate admitting it, I couldn't wait for it to be over. Near the last quarter or so of the movie it just got redundant and all I could think was, 'Ok, this can be over any time now.' I enjoyed seeing characters from Nemo make appearances, and a couple new characters were charming, but overall it's not enough to make Dory an instant classic like Nemo. Pixar outdid themselves with the animation but you can tell this is a sequel for the sake of a sequel, not because they came up with a great storyline.",5,46,97,23 June 2016
Arrival," Just alright
","Arrival is an okay film. There's really nothing wrong with it per se, but it didn't quite make a lasting impression for me. I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, so maybe I'm the wrong person to give an opinion, but I don't get the hype surrounding this film. It was a good original story that passed two hours of my time, but it's not a movie I'll be discussing with friends, or watching again.",6,1,3,5 January 2019
Pitch Perfect," Lesbi-honest....
","I truly thought this would be a new favorite movie for me. However even half-way through I just knew I would never want to see it again. I am stunned that so many people think it's fantastic. Honestly a lot of the people I know who adore this movie are really immature. But I guess that's beside the point. Pitch Perfect reminded me of that movie that you think is awesome when you're thirteen, and when you watch it again in your early twenties you can't believe you ever liked it. The characters are unlikable (besides Fat Amy because she's the only one who says anything slightly funny), and it's a really predictable story that is WAY too clich√©. Granted, there are some okay movies that are predictable that you still enjoy watching (The Proposal for instance), but this is not one of them. Bottom line; this is a movie that was extremely overrated and made out to be some fantastic, enjoyable favorite, when in reality it was boring, dumb, and on the verge of annoying. I am truly shocked at the high reviews people gave it because I think it is one of the worst movies I've seen.",1,18,34,30 July 2013
