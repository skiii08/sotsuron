Antz," A bit sophisticated for kids and scary animation.
","I went with a child's expectations and found that I was watching as an adult.  Very hip, snappy dialogue and a bit 'out there' for the average kid. As well, the animation was dark and the ants looked quite similar and, to a child, I would think they would be quite scary.",8,0,0,26 October 1998
