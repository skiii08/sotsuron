Marie Antoinette," Reasons why i believe this film was great
","Iknow many people see this movie as mainly sets and costume design with not much actual content, but I disagree. Sophia Coppola(spelling?)told the story of Marie Antoinette in a very original way. She let the audience have their own opinions about what was happening and whether to perceive Marie Antoinette as an inconsiderate, greedy person or someone who was just confused and unsure of what to do. Many say that the film's dialog was inconsistent with the age but thats whats so great about this film. It takes the black and white textbook image of Marie Antoinette and gives it life, gives it spirit. It wasn't just a documentary, it was imperfect and real which makes it so incredibly entertaining. Also, the director uses a lot of silent acting which as i mentioned before lets the audience draw their own conclusions. When their mad they don't have a long drawn out argument, you see it in Kirsten dunst's face. YOu feel it without having to see it which makes the film less redundant then the over-acting in many films where you see the feeling and also feeling. Not saying that that kind of acting is bad its just the acting in this film makes it modern and ingenious and brings the tale into this generation. It connects the conflicts of the french revolution to the conflicts of this day and age.",Null,1,4,26 March 2007
