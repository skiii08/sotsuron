Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wipe them out ...... all of them
","I don't understand it this movie got horrible reviews worthy of Corky Ramano, but honestly this is a great film.  You have everything.  Music, action, drama and the lightsaber battle that we always heard about but never got to see.  But when poeple say that I guess they have never seen Return of the Jedi.  So I implore you please look at the movie and do not have your vision clouded by the people so close minded that they don't see the sure intelligence of the film.  And so to end I will say the Pod Race was pretty bad.",10,1,2,3 July 2002
