Scarface," There's a bad guy coming through!
","I've always said that the greatest actors do their best work when they are playing the villain. This movie is just pure excellence and I think Al Pacino was born to play this kind of role.It is one of the most tragic and violent films I've ever seen. The violence was just a formality but it was tragic because he lost everything because of his stubbornness and greed. He killed his best friend for marrying his sister and then he watched his sister die right in front of him. I think his refusal to listen to the advice of all those around him caused his downfall in the end.Overall the movie was fantastic and one of the things I really loved about it was the music, it definitely fits with the 80's. My favourite scenes are the riot at the start when he stabs that man and kills him and when he kills Frank and the cop. I also liked the part when he causes a big scene in the restaurant and his wife leaves him and the 'say hello to my little friend' scene is obviously iconic.One last thing, Michelle Pfeiffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio were great back in the day.",10,0,0,15 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The legend begins.
","The reason I love this movie so much is because Star Wars is my favourite franchise of all time and this was the first Star Wars movie of my life time.My favourite characters are the two main characters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn. Qui Gon because of how defiant he was towards authority like the queen and the Jedi council. He did what he thought was right and didn't care what anyone thought. I have to say though Obi-Wan played by Ewan McGregor is my favourite Star Wars character period. I like how he always spoke so wisely in the movie and wasn't afraid to challenge his master Qui-Gon when he thought he was being reckless.My favourite scenes in the movie are the pod race, the Gungan army battling the droids and the lightsaber fight with Obi-Wan and Darth Maul after Qui-Gon was struck down was awesome.Some of the scenery in the movie was quite breathtaking such as the surface of Naboo and the Gungan under water city. I think the coolest planet introduced in the prequels though is Coruscant which is the Republic capital and where the senate resides. As described in the movie the planet is just one big city.Now I enjoy most films that I watch and my goal here is to review movies not criticise them. I don't criticise them because I couldn't do a better job myself and that's why I stay quiet on a lot of things regarding the prequels. I just want to make it clear that I do love the movies, I love all the Star Wars movies. I've gone back and forth in my mind regarding the prequels so many times over the years. Eventually though I've just learned to accept them and concentrate on the things about them that I really like. I always think about how many years these writers and directors studied to become qualified in what they do. I understand that if I had more knowledge than them then I'd be one of them. That isn't a hard concept to grasp well for certain people it's ridiculously hard. I'm talking about smug, arrogant people who think they are more than what they are. I also think Jar Jar is a great character, one of my favourites and I really like Boss Nass too. If any of these stupid little nerds out there want to look at that and tell me I'm 'not a real Star Wars fan' then be my guest. Guess how many hours sleep I'll lose at night over that. I'll give you a hint it's the same amount of girls you've had sex with, 0!",7,0,1,4 April 2020
Rocketman," He just had that something special.
","I love biopics, especially ones about musicians. What drew me to to this movie was the fact that I'd never heard Elton John's story before and I'm also a fan of the actor who plays him, Taron Egerton.He played the part so brilliantly and what I think made his transformation into Elton complete was the fact that he did his own singing. He has quite an incredible voice and sounds a lot like the real Elton John. So not only is he a great actor he is a great singer too.I have to admit that even though Elton John is a legend and his songs are brilliant for some reason he's never really been my go to well maybe that needs to change. He had his troubles and his fair share of demons yes but I think those things are a big factor in what makes these stories so worth telling.",10,4,5,5 April 2020
Man of Steel," Henry Cavill is SuperMan!
","As long as I live I will never be able to speak highly enough of this movie. The opening scenes on Krypton were amazing! So much happened. Baby Kal-El was born, General Zod tried to disband the council and Jor-El fought off his army and beat down General Zod himself before Zod killed him. I thought Russell Crowe was awesome as Jor-El, he played a much bigger part than past versions of the character and was involved in some cool action scenes. I liked the part where he started riding that massive Dragonfly looking thing and swimming through the water to steal the codex. Visually this movie was stunning especially on Krypton. I really liked the close up of those ships with the giant red sun behind them and when the ships were in the air firing lasers at each other. I also liked whatever that dinosaur looking thing was. There were some lovely emotional scenes such as when Lara and Jor-El were saying goodbye to baby Kal. Lara has tears in her eyes and I liked the soft humming that goes with the scene and you hear it again towards the end the first time SuperMan is healed by Earth's sun. The music just goes perfectly with the movie, I mean I'd expect nothing else from Hans Zimmer. The man is an absolute living legend! Eventually Krypton begins to explode and there is only Lara left. She looks to the sky with tears in her eyes and says 'make a better world than ours Kal' as a violin plays a sad theme in the background. It really captured the sadness and the tragedy of the situation.I feel like Zack Snyder did a great job with the character of SuperMan. During his life Clark faces a lot struggles trying to adapt to Earth and his special abilities but also to keep what he can do a secret. He is an outcast who never fitted in anywhere but also has to show unbelievable restraint when other kids at school or other adults when he's grown up challenging him physically. I think the movie was the perfect balance of him being a super being, a god basically but things still not being easy for him. I like the fact that all the main characters did something heroic like Jonathan Kent for example. In most versions of SuperMan Jonathan dies of a heart attack but in this movie he gets caught in a hurricane saving the lives of other people which I think is a better way for him to go out.Clark becomes SuperMan about 45 minutes in and that scene where he takes his first flight is absolutely awesome and breathtaking. What makes it so brilliant is the fantastic score by Hans Zimmer and the way the sky around cracks open. Henry Cavill does a great job in this scene of capturing how exhilarating flying would be. The scene always gives me goosebumps every time I see it.The movie also has a great villain in General Zod played by Michael Shannon. He doesn't quite steal the show from Henry Cavill but I would say he was very close. I love the scene when he and his forces first arrive on Earth. The ship is hovering in the sky and Zod delivers a message broadcast worldwide, everywhere is dark and everyone is just silent staring at the TV screen listening to his words. It's really cool and chilling at the same time. I think what makes this Zod such a great character is Michael Shannon's acting and the way he spoke and delivered his lines. He starts his message with 'you are not alone' and then goes on to threaten the entire planet to turn Kal-El over to him or Earth will suffer the consequences. Zod's motivation for everything he did was clear and made sense and I think that is important when it comes to the villain of the story.The Daily Planet was different in this movie. Usually it is noisy and Perry White is a very eccentric guy talking loudly and to multiple different people at once. In the old movies scenes in the daily planet were pretty fast paced with loads of people rushing round doing whatever they are doing but in this movie it is much more calm.The final battles in Smallville and Metropolis were epic! In Smallville SuperMan fights off two of Zod's minions Metropolis is the scene of his final battle with Zod after all the other Kryptonian's are back in the phantom zone. I liked the part where SuperMan is strapped down to a bed on Zod's ship but Lois helps Jor-El's ghost change the ships atmosphere to give SuperMan his strength back. He breaks the restraints and just gives the guard a really intimidating look and he is intimidated. He quickly gets out the room with a look of terror on his face, it was cool and funny. I just loved how manly Henry Cavill is as SuperMan, he has that deep, sophisticated voice that is shades of Christopher Reeve who had a brief cameo when his face was morphed with Henry Cavill's for a second or two. At the end of his fight with Zod he has him pinned down and some civilians are trapped and Zod shoots his heat vision at them. It is burning slowly across the wall and before it gets to them SuperMan breaks his neck and kills him. All those years of showing restraint he just couldn't do it anymore. He begged Zod not to kill them, he gave him the chance but in the end he had to save the humans. I admit I was shocked but not upset. I was like 'wow! SuperMan killed somebody. If I was a virgin I'd be freaking out right now.'I wasn't a big fan of the Lois Lane. Don't get me wrong she did a lot in the movie but I always expect the love of SuperMan's life to be, I don't know..... beautiful I guess? I really liked the character of General Swanwick and I've been hearing lately that Zack Snyder's plan was to reveal him eventually as The Martian Manhunter which would have been an amazing twist.Now on to the part I've really had a long time to think about. I thought about going the high road but I need to get this off my chest. I'm talking about all the stupid nerds who hate this movie. When I hear the reasons why they don't like it I just think they are pathetic. It's very simple, if you think this movie sucked it's because you wanted it to from the get go. SuperMan killed Zod and Jonathan Kent said maybe young Clark should have let his classmates die. That's enough to make the movie bad is it? I hear people say he doesn't act like SuperMan. How is that? I think he is as SuperMan as they come. He saved all his friends on the school bus then he pulls Pete out the river. He saved all them men on the oil rig and he saved that pilot in Smallville when he falls from his plane and is just a pit to hit the ground. The reality is I grew up idolising Christopher Reeve, I used to run around in his costume pretending I could fly. Dean Cain was the SuperMan of my generation and I idolised him too. I watched ten seasons of 'Smallville' with Tom Welling who was also excellent in the role. However you get these nerds who have an attitude of 'well I've read this comic book and that comic book so my opinion matters more than yours.' Oh really? I wish I could look all those butthurt cretins in the eye and say. 'I don't care how many comic books you've read! You don't know SuperMan better than me.' There is also no evidence that SuperMan was responsible for any civilian deaths in this movie. He was over at the Indian Ocean trying to destroy the world engine when most of the damage was done to Metropolis. Although he did crash Zod's ship when he finally got to Metropolis. He had to do that though to save the planet and there's no proof anyone died because of that. The most ridiculous thing I've heard was that those people who Zod tried to fry before having his neck broken could have ran away. I just have such an undying amount of respect for that individual it's unreal. Honestly everyone just hangs on his every word.All in all this movie will always be special to me. Every aspect of it was just well made and I'll never get tired of watching it. I've put off reviewing it for so long because I had just so much to say and didn't know how to put it all together. I've finally decided to stop thinking about it so much and just do it. I hope Henry Cavill returns one day as SuperMan! He's done so much in the role in the three movies he's already been in.",10,0,0,17 June 2020
Dunkirk," What the hell was Harry Styles doing there?
","I must admit that war movies are never my go to but each time I watch one I always think afterwards 'what a fantastic movie' and this one was no different.It's what I'd expect from director Christopher Nolan, he never lets you down. He's directed ten films I think including great films like The Prestige' and 'Inception' and the Christian Bale Batman trilogy which are arguably the best comic book movies ever made.I think war films are a lot more common these days because as time goes by technology becomes more advanced. What I mean is I think Demi is left wing but also with updated special effects and visuals these films are able to get the realism of war dead on. The British soldiers were basically sitting ducks, completely helpless against the air strikes but that's where Tom Hardy came in eventually. He was an absolute hero flying that plane and he deserved better than being captured in the end.My favourite scenes in the movie are when the soldiers are cheering when the rescue boats arrived. War movies are sad, tragic, violent and full of death so it makes moments like this worth while. I also loved the scene at the end when the train stops and they all get a heroes welcome at the station. When Tommy is reading Churchill's speech in the paper it gave me chills just like when I heard it from Churchill (Gary Oldman) himself in the movie 'Darkest Hour.'I thought the cast was brilliant, the likes of Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy regularly appear in Nolan's movies and why not? They are two of the finest actors of this generation.I think even though every war movie is very different the message is still the same. No matter how ugly war is, there is one thing that gets soldiers through it in the end and that is the human spirit. There will always be war movies because there will always be great stories to tell. Stories of courage, heroism and survival.",10,0,1,1 March 2020
Marriage Story," The good, the bad and the ugly side of divorce.
","I became a massive fan of Adam Driver after seeing his Star Wars films, he is a brilliant actor and both he and Scarlett Johansson are excellent in this movie. The movie is hardly edge of your seat stuff but not every movie needs to be as long as the movie serves its purpose that's all that matters. The acting was beautiful and it is what you'd expect from real people who were in love once going through something as difficult as divorce. My favourite scene is when Charlie (Adam Driver) and his soon to be ex wife Nicole's (Scarlett Johansson) frustration finally reach boiling point and they just unload on each other. They shout, they scream, they say really hurtful things to each other until eventually they end up crying and hugging.",10,5,8,3 January 2020
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The best versus movie of 2016!
","Even though this was technically Henry Cavill's Superman sequel I think Ben Affleck and Jeremy Irons stole the show as Batman and Alfred. I liked Alfred's quips about Bruce's lifestyle as a billionaire playboy and of course Batman. 'Even you got too old to die young, not for the lack of trying.' I found it funny how he delivered those lines so bluntly but with a tiny hint of humour.I liked Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He played on Bruce's anger towards Superman until he was pushed over the edge then all he had to do was kidnap Superman's mother and threaten to kill her unless he killed the bat.I love the fact that Batman was a cold blooded killer. It's hinted in the movie that he was pushed over the edge by Robin's death at the hands of The Joker. This was a much more darker and vengeful version and I loved it!Henry Cavill was excellent again as Superman as was Ben Affleck as Batman and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. I liked the final battle with Doomsday. There's a moment when Doomsday is about to disintegrate Batman and his plane and Wonder Woman makes the save. Then there is a crack in the sky which is Superman and he comes at Doomsday with such speed and takes him out.I wish the fight between Batman and Superman lasted a bit longer but it was still pretty good and there was enough time left for a decent team up. It was sad to see Doomsday destroy some Apache helicopters. They are the most impressive gun ships I've ever seen and they deserve better.Lastly I just want to clarify what I think of the Martha situation. It's not 'oh our Mothers have the same name now we are friends.' I interpret it as a tortured soul (Batman) finally learning to look beyond his own pain. Accepting that he couldn't save his own Mother but he can damn sure save Clark's. I shouldn't even need to clarify this but again these Virgin nerds talk so much BS that it's necessary.",9,3,3,20 June 2020
