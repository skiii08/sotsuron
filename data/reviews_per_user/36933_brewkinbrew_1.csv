The Benchwarmers," Sandler and the boys keep this one in the same ball park
","This movie can be summed up very simply. If you like the kind of movies put out by guys like Adam Sandler, Jon Lovitz, David Spade, and Rob Schneider, then you will probably like this movie.If you are needing deep character development, realistic scenarios, and Oscar caliber acting then you will probably not like this movie.My wife and I enjoy the SNL kind of humor and found this movie to be quite funny. However, although it may seem like a kids baseball movie, it did have quite a few sexual references and if your children are young or you don't feel that you want to expose them (or yourself) to that kind of content you might want to avoid this movie.",9,0,1,14 April 2006
