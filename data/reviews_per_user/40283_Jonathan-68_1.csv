Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This movie was nailed by critics before they'd even seen it
",This movie was nailed by critics before they'd even seen it. I don't know what it was but they just seemed to have it in for this brilliant movie from the beginning. They payed out the remarkably brilliant story line and Jake Lloyd's unreal acting. The truth of the matter is this movie has been and always will be remembered as yet another amazing part of the 2nd greatest story even told.,10,0,0,11 January 2000
