Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Never laughed so much during one movie. Tears rolled. Sides split.
","Brilliant. Inspired. Ballsy beyond belief. Sasha Baron Cohen, the Evil Knievel of modern comedy, takes so many chances he's bound to miss sometimes but there aren't too many misses in this, his first starring movie. Gifted at the level of Robin Williams or Jonathan Winters or Steve Wright or Groucho Marx, Cohen possesses that rare ability to see the same world as we do, swallow it, and regurgitate back bizarre silly reflections that simultaneously make you laugh out loud, tickle your soul and show you the real work left for humanity. Some of the gags in this movie are so one of a kind, so sui generis, we might never see their like again. The only sad part is that BORAT becoming famous lessens the chance that there will ever be another BORAT movie with as much existential guerrilla comedy. BORAT in a hall or stadium of the unsuspecting is the finest example of asymmetrical comedic warfare that ever made the screen. I laughed so much tears rolled down my cheeks.

Legends of the Fall," Great Epic Fable
",I loved this movie the first time I saw it and I just saw it again on HULU.com and I still love it. The acting is finely tuned and never heavy handed even though the story skates right up to the edge but never crosses into melodrama. LOTF is the exact point between a chic flick and a guy movie and from beginning to end it's has a great mood that flows like a river. Every movie has a group of haters and that's just the nature of responses to art. You might be one of those haters but if you love early 20th Century westerns and epics and bonded families and love stories and can handle the violence you're more likely than not to enjoy this finely made film and thrive on the abundant joys and sadness and spiritual complexity of Legends Of The Fall.,9,1,4,28 August 2008
Inside Man," I wanted to like it more.
","In the way all orgasms are some kind of wonderful except occasionally they can be disappointing, this was disappointing. This is a good movie but I want better than good from Mr. Lee and this cast. The acting is fine although Mr. Washington is too familiar (didn't I see this guy in the one with the terrorists in New York and the one with him in a Hawaiian shirt in Florida), Ms. Foster is set cleverly against previous type yet distracting because of that in a way Mr. Washington wasn't distracting against type in Training Day, and Clive Owens seems wasted in the few moments we actually see him. The heist hook is clever but not fully explored, the few action sequences are nicely Hollywood and the plot keeps engorging but is ultimately a bit too flaccid to be penetrating. There is a little gem at the end but as I walked out of the theater I was thinking, 'Was that it?'",6,1,1,26 March 2006
