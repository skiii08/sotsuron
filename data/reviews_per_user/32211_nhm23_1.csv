Skyfall," Brining old school back
","Skyfall is quite possibly, one of the best the franchise has produced so far and is most definitely the best Daniel Craig has performed in the totality of his 3 bond movies. There were so many factors making this specific bond movie outstanding and up to par even with its original bonds. Starting with the opening credits and the incredible graphics they entailed working so harmoniously with Adele's theme song 'Skyfall' specifically made for this movie. Usually not a lot of people pay attention to the opening credits of a movie, but everyone's eyes were glued to the IMAX screen here at the Villagio Cinema in Qatar. The movie focused a lot on the story and the plot as opposed to having it too action packed and meaningless. Simultaneously the plot and the climb to the climax wasn't too twisted to the point of losing the audience. However the action scenes in the movie were by no means undermined. It was the perfect balance. The movie finally included the James Bond trademark line 'Bond, James Bond' which was missing from the last 2 bond movies. Sam Mendes really outdid himself with 'Skyfall'. The movie' had a sense of simplicity to everything about it, resulting in an overwhelming sense of authenticity. Another successful addition to the James Bond franchise. Terrific line delivery by all actors, superb performance, directing and Camera angles to be taught. Overall the movie comes very highly recommended.",8,5,14,30 October 2012
