Requiem for a Dream," A Reason To Get Up In The Morning
","Incredibly powerful and sobering, 'Requiem for a Dream' is one of strongest anti-drug movies ever made. The lives of four people, a mother and her only son, a beautiful artistic young woman, and a charming young man, are destroyed by addiction in a parable of illicit and licit drug use. This extraordinary film by young director (and co-writer) Darren Aronofsky shows how Americans crush their positive energies with chemical crutches be they heroin or little blue pills prescribed by a doctor.Ellen Burstyn won an Academy Award (2000) for her performance of sad Sara Goldfarb who sinks deeper into delusion about being on her favorite infomercial TV program as she gets hooked on prescribed medications. Her son Harry (Jared Leto), his buddy Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) hope to get rich off just one more score but get hooked and watch helplessly as their lives disintegrate.The direction is slick and arty with interesting visual effects that create a fast and furious pace that mirrors the drug rushes that sequence the film. In little over an hour and a half we witness a complete meltdown. The acting is superb from start to finish and even supporting roles such as Louise Lasser's Ada, Sara's long-suffering friend, add depth and dimension to this tragic tale. A must see but not for the faint-hearted and don't expect a typical Hollywood happy ending.",9,1,2,27 May 2006
Citizen Kane," Multimedia Masterpiece
","Citizen Kane (CK) is considered the archetypal art film, even by many of its biggest fans.  But at the time it was made many of the 'arty' techniques it employs so effortlessly were new and innovative uses of sound and high-tech visual effects.  What Orson Welles (the 25 year old boy genius who wrote, directed, and stars in the movie) achieved in CK was the realization of cinema as multi - media capable of imparting rapid cognition.  We do not actually meet protagonist Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles) until half an hour into the movie, yet by that time we pretty much know (one version) of his life story.Every scene, every line of dialogue, contributes to the whole yet we are left pretty much at the beginning (despite the famous surprise end) when the movie ends.  But you have the sense of having been on a long insightful journey.Citizen Kane is almost 60 years old, yet is still considered one of the (if not the) greatest films ever made.  This reviewer scoffed at the idea at college and has searched for more perfect films but has to admit that it remains fresh and terrific.  Why?  Because, like good fiction, CK takes you into a world that is almost real and through a tale that spans the ages.  It is still a masterwork.",Null,2,3,6 July 2000
The Caine Mutiny," War is a 24 hour a day job
","Humphrey Bogart turns in one of his very best performances as the quirky Captain Queeg who takes over command of The Caine, a war-weary armored ship, in the last days of the Second World War. His senior officers, played by Van Johnson, Fred MacMurray, and Robert Francis, have a hard time accommodating his strict stewardship and begin to question his authority. When The Caine gets active duty, tensions mount, tempers flare, and the crew gets mutinous! In the background there is lots of action, a banal but innocuous love affair, some schmaltzy humor, and a strong unquestioning dose of 1950s feel good American patriotism mixed with some new Hollywood Jung/Freud psycho-babble.After the mutiny on The Caine, the movie ends with an even bigger bang--a terrific court-martial that pits defender Jose Ferrer against prosecutor E.G. Marshall. Jose Ferrar wins over the officers in the end and his final interrogation of Queeg (Bogart) remains one of the most powerful courtroom scenes in any movie made since. The end of the picture leaves us with a riddle and some judicious comments from Jose Ferrar about social rank and true loyalty.What makes this film such a classic are the tremendous performances by all the actors, from a very young Lee Marvin as a lowly seaman to all those already mentioned, each is flawless. Stanley Kramer produced and this is his best effort, far better than later movies such as 'The Defiant Ones' or 'Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.'For any fan of Bogart, good dialogue, or intriguing story lines, this movie will delight. One of the best -- watch it!",9,5,8,5 July 2001
Doctor Zhivago," STRELNIKOV!
","A magnificent epic tale of Russia, Doctor Zhivago is one of the great movies of all time.  It is essential that it be viewed on either a large screen (if possible) or 'letterbox' version in video format, because of the breadth and scope of every shot and scene.  If at all possible, view while snow (heavy preferably) falls outside.  This is a beautiful movie on so many levels: the cast--Omar Sharif, Julie Christie, Geraldine Chaplin, so many others, caught at the peak of their bloom and talent, the tale--sweeping drama spanning the collapse of the Russian Empire and the early days of the Soviet Union with numerous intertwined relationships in the manner of the great Russian novelists, the locales--well, it was actually filmed in Spain and Scandanavia but, hey, still gorgeous!The wonderfully complex plot centers around a young (at the film's outset) Russian doctor and his love for two women, his wife, and a woman that represents all the promise and confusion of the new age.  From beginning to end, this is a riveting, thoroughly satisfying movie-going experience. Another must see!",Null,0,0,6 July 2000
Apocalypse Now," Stay On The Boat
","Tortuous anti-war epic that ultimately disappoints despite the fantastic cinematography and superb overall production. The performances by Robert Duvall (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor) and Marlon Brando, meant to be highlights, only reduce the picture's gritty realism and lose the viewer's interest with overly dramatized performances and, with Brando, at times unintelligible dialogue.What saves the film, and makes it great, is the narrated journey of Captain Willard up the Mekong and into the dark reaches of Indo-China. Martin Sheen gives a tremendous performance as the super-serious unofficial operative Willard whose mission is to seek out the mutinous Colonel Kurtz (Brando), creator of a dysfunctional Shangri-La deep in the jungle. Plenty of action and more than one bizarre sojourn (particularly in the less edited Redux version) greet Willard and his riverboat crew of war movie personalities--wonderfully performed by all including a very young Laurence Fishburne as the gunner's mate, 'Mr. Clean.'Together they traverse through all the ironies and confusing realities of warfare and keep you on the edge of your seat. Once on land, however, the movie bogs down into a badly scripted climax between Willard and Kurtz.Definitely worth watching only give yourself enough time to appreciate the pacing and by all means, don't worry if you never see the end!",7,1,1,6 October 2003
Aliens," Ripley...I'm scared
","Despite the unparalleled success of Titanic, this is the movie that made Jim Cameron and is still arguably his best effort.  Released in 1986, two years after his groundbreaking Terminator, Aliens is a celebration of American military might (the movie was made after six years of unprecedented defense spending under President Reagan) and mastery over nature.  Although it depends heavily on the original Alien (1979) in art direction and style (and, of course, subject matter), it stands on its own as an equally compelling and suspenseful sci-fi horror movie.Sigourney Weaver excells at fleshing out the Ripley character into a true screen icon--she's the female Rambo.  All secondary characters (Carrie Henn (Newt), Bill Paxton, Lance Henrickson, even Paul Reiser) are well acted and memorable.  The pacing is quick, gritty, and if it doesn't get your heart racing you are indeed jaded!A great fun ride, one of the grand blockbuster films of the 1980s.  See it and make sure you're in a dark room!",Null,0,0,29 November 2000
Trainspotting," Is this what it means to be Scottish?
","Trainspotting (TS) is an example of the kind of film that makes a big splash in the USA but could never be made by Hollywood. Easily one of the best movies of the 1990s, TS captures a sense of realism that eludes big American studios. Most Americans choose to see the movie as a cautionary tale about heroin and drug use but this view misses the mark. All the heroin excesses of the movie's central characters, Renton, Spud, Sick-Boy, Tommy, etc., pale when compared to the alcoholic pyschopath Begbie. Trainspotting is really a very hard look at the shallowness and purposelessness of life in the `post-industrial' world. Using the old Scottish capital, Edinburgh, as its principal backdrop, TS touches on all aspects of post-Thatcher Britain, from unemployment, urban decay, welfare, Aids, to drugs, sex, and pornography, as seen in the lives of a group of Scottish youths. The movie is about surviving in the late 20th Century world.The performances by all are superb. Ewan MacGregor is spectacular as the movie's chief protagonist, and even the smallest roles are well acted. Throughout TS, the use of music, locales, flash-backs, and voice-over narration, is well conceived and creates a gritty pace. The extreme realism is achieved by a surrealistic use of shock, humor, and mood. There are both truly shocking and very funny moments in this movie. But more than just a mirror on decayed modern society, Trainspotting is a story of ultimate triumph. Don't miss this one!",Null,0,0,3 December 1999
