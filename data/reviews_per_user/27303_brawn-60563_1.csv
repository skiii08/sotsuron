The Longest Yard," Best Comedy Football movie out there
","Want to see a great football movieÂ… here it is! The Longest Yard directed by Peter Segal. This a fantastic movie that will make you laugh until you cry. It stars Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, and Burt Reynolds, it released into theaters in 2005. The movie was produced by 'Happy Madison' film productions. I've noticed that Adam Sandler has been in a lot of movies produced by Happy Madison, and every one I saw was really good. Adam Sandler and Chris Rock make a good on- screen duo, splitting the major character roles in the movie. The movie takes place in a prison camp where Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler), a former NFL quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers, is put in prison for a DUI for driving while he was carrying beer and taunting the police. He got put in charge of creating a football team of the inmates in the prison to compete against the guards in a semi-pro football game live on TV. Crewe met up with another inmate named Caretaker (Chris Rock.) Caretaker said he is terrible at football, so he decided to help Crewe help to form his team together. Lastly, he meets this former college and NFL coach named Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds.) Scarborough agreed to help Crewe collaborate with the football team to work the inmates into football shape. I really liked this film over all because I love comedy and football all together. It really sticks out in my mind how Paul Crewe formed this football team with the inmates who never played football a day in their lives. It was impressed that he never gave up on them, and they never gave up on him. Likewise, the comedy stood out to me the most. I was surprised how funny the movie was when I first watched it. Almost every seen cracked me up, and I couldn't stop laughing. For example, how one of the character's clothes lined one of players and said, 'I think he sh** himself,' The rest of the announcers and crowd said it as well, and I was laughing my head off. Lastly, how Turley said after Crewe decided to play the game, 'good, now I don't need to stab you.' Crewe was shocked and said, 'good to know.' The characters really seemed realistic, I've noticed that because it didn't look like they took any part of acting out, and they used their own emotions and feelings during the movie. I cared about what happened to the actors. For example, the collaboration of plays between in the game. Also, Crewe's passion for the team to win instead of him throwing the game instead of repeating what he did in the past. This movie was made in 2005, so I expected all the visual effects to be how they should be in the movie. There were no technical aspects in the movie. The soundtracks for this movie fit together so well. I didn't know the names of the songs, but they were all very sports-like and made the scenes perfect. The story of the movie made it compelling because of the plot, the characters, and the game of football. Every aspect that was listed made the movie great.The Longest Yard was a great movie. I recommend it to everyone who loves football and great comedy. Adam Sandler and Chris Rock make the movie perfect through their acting and the way they work with the co-stars. Also, the way throughout the movie how the characters learned to play football and work as a team, and never gave up. Lastly, the chemistry between all the actors in the movie, they've all worked together in other movies as well. They all tend to work together and like each other a lot. The Longest Yard is a movie that I would recommend to everyone.",10,0,1,2 November 2017
