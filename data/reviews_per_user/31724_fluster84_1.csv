Resident Evil: Afterlife," If you don't care for the previous RE movies, don't bother with this one.
","The use of 3D makes this movie watchable. I am sure fans of the previous RE films won't be disappointed. The zombies look good, there are big guns, great sound effects, and lots of scenes with people flying through the air in slow motion. I would recommend watching this movie if you love a good old fashioned frag fest on screen, but please do not expect anything more. This is a typical CGI blessed action flick and in my opinion its better than the 2nd and 3rd RE movies (which isn't saying a lot really). In conclusion - If you never see this movie, you aren't missing anything. I would strongly recommend it for die hard RE fans but for others, this one is nothing special. P.S. If you managed to sit through the entire movie, maybe you should stick around a little longer till the end of the credits. Its worth it.",4,5,12,12 September 2010
