The Blair Witch Project," The Scariest Movie I Have Ever Seen
","I just saw this movie last night and I can truly say that it is the scariest movie I have ever seen, and I have seen a fair amount of scary movies. The entire movie is tense even in the daytime, but at night, I don't think my heart has ever beaten faster in my life.  The fact that it was filmed entirely with a home video camera makes it all the more real.  The Blair Witch Project really breaks the sterotype that scary movies are never good and always have a stupid and unrealistic story.  This is one of the best movies I have ever seen also.  Whomever said that scary movies can't be good is really eating his words now.  Absolutly Great Movie.",8,1,2,18 August 1999
