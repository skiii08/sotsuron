50 First Dates," Movies Like This Don't Come Along Very Often
","I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this movie today. Although I hadn't seen the trailer, the plotline sounded interesting and I like Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler so I decided to give it a shot.Was I ever pleasantly surprised.  This movie was very refreshing with a plotline I hadn't seen done before.  It was sweet and cute and funny and heartwarming and it had a good soundtrack. I enjoyed every minute of it which doesn't happen very often with the movies that are out these days. The animals were also very cute.If you like romantic comedies and want to see something different, go see this movie.  I plan to see it a few more times and also buy the dvd.",9,0,0,13 February 2004
Unbreakable," I Was Very Disappointed
","I really expected to enjoy this film.   What I had read about it made it sound interesting.  I came to this site before going to the movie and saw that the movie had a rating of 8.0, so I thought it would be good.   
But I was VERY disappointed.  I thought the movie was slow and boring.   I thought David's son was rather annoying.   I only found about 5 minutes of the film to be exciting.   And maybe 1/2 hour of it to be interesting.   The rest was quite boring.   I wanted to walk out, but didn't for two reasons. One was that I was in the middle of my row, surrounded by people.   The other was because I thought maybe something about the ending would be good.  I didn't think the ending was good. I don't understand how this movie received a rating of 8 at this site when a lot of the comments here are negative.",2,0,1,25 November 2000
Rock Star," I liked it!
","I didn't really know what to expect from this movie and I'm not particularly a metal fan - although I do like it once in a while.  I thought the movie might somewhat entertaining, but I was pretty surprised that I actually ended up liking it alot.  I'm not sure why.   Maybe it was because I think guys with long hair are great to look at, and because Mark Walberg was pretty hot, Jennifer Anniston was entertaining to watch and the music was really good.  I particularly liked the song, We All Die Young.  
I liked this movie so much that I might even buy it on DVD.",Null,1,2,9 March 2003
