Ali," Don't rely on box office numbers
","It's unfortunate Ali lost money at the box office and actually is on the list for flops/turkeys of 2012. I loved this film both for its content and delivery. I know about Muhammad Ali but not to the extent that most others do and this was the first film I saw that really depicted him in a way that should be seen for those who are not fans of his. This film was emotional and a sign of good acting and directing. This film should not be judged for how much money it produced because it has so much more to offer as a story than just a film filled with special effects, this is more of raw truth and character.",10,1,4,2 December 2013
