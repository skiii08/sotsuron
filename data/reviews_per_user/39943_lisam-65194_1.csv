Ford v Ferrari," Absolutely fantastic
",Honestly cannot believe how good this film is! Was fixated all the way through and was sad when it was over. Obviously being a racing film the cars are out of this world but had me laughing my head off at points Matt Damon and Christian bale are actors I usually avoid but in this both are superb. An absolute must watch,10,2,2,5 January 2020
