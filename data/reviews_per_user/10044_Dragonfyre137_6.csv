Requiem for a Dream," Addicting
","It's weekend, my girlfriend is at her parents' and this has been on my watch-list for too long to ignore.The first few minutes I had no Idea what was going in the movie. Getting over these minutes was difficult but somehow I got addicted to the movie because it wasn't some cheap action movie or b-movie drama. It deals with a topic usually off-limits and does so in the most brutal and honest way. I just finished watching it and feel very gloomy about the message. The cast is great and they do a great effort in making you believe in what you see on your TV.I can only recommend you to take precautions before watching it and watch it with a close friend if you are rather sensible and/or get a comedy to watch afterwards. I made the mistake and did nothing of it. The night is late and the movie got me great deal of thinking. It somehow makes you rethink your life, rethink your own addictions - not necessarily drugs.Good thought for the night? Decide yourself.",9,0,1,29 March 2013
Gravity," Irrational behaviour, logical flaws and plot holes
","I've read a lot good and bad things about the movie recently, so I decided to go to my local blockbuster video and get a copy and watch it to finally understand what all the mess is about.I've been interested in this kind of genre since I can remember and thus have seen most movies/series depicting realistic space-action (to name a few of my favourites: 2001 Odyssey in Space, Battlestar Galactica, Event Horizon ...). So my expectations were pretty high.I was positively surprised by the realism of the general space-environment. In contrast to other similar movies there is - as expected - no sound in space except all the sound coming from/through the space suits of the two characters, giving it a nice feeling. Who ever played the Dead Space Series - especially DS 2, will surely know what feeling I'm talking about.WARNING, HERE BE SPOILERS!There is one major thing that bugs me: When Ryan get caught in the ropes of the ISS landing module and catches the security rope with Matt hanging on it, why is he still being pulled away? There is supposed to be no gravity and no pressure, so given she caught the rope and stopped his momentum, he should stop moving. But he doesn't, as if he were pulled away from her. Now I've watched the whole movie with my girlfriend and we've discussed this scene and at first we thought it was the earths gravity, but as some later scenes revealed, Matt wasn't pulled away vertically to earth, but rather tangentially. So this whole scene simply makes no sense.An what's the deal with Matt so apathetically accepting his death? He didn't show any little bit of emotion throughout all of the movie. And why the heck did he keep talking to Ryan and encouraging her to talk to him while her oxygen was running low? Talking uses a lot more oxygen than simply keeping silent. If HE didn't know, shouldn't SHE know, as a medic? I know, I know, if both of them wouldn't talk for all that time, the movie would have been even worse, but that's not well thought-out. Some of you might say he did so to calm her down, but the fact of oxygen running low faster with bow talking could have at the very least mentioned by one of the two.I also found it quite fascinating that Ryan, as for someone with virtually no experience with landing-modules, had practically no difficulty in operating a Russian and Chinese device. Except the one time where she choose which button to press by 'eeny, meeny, miny, moe'.Sadly, Matt had virtually no character: He was emotionless and showed no character development throughout the movie. Actually, he barely showed any character, at all. As to Ryan: Yes, well, she lost her daughter in a totally unrelated event and at first had no problem simply dying, until a hallucination told her not to. Isn't the NASA running strict psychological test in order to make sure psychically unstable or weak people like Ryan wouldn't get enlisted into a mission like this because they could endanger the crew and the mission? Not to speak about her disobedience in the beginning of the movie.Sadly, most of the movie is not much more than Clooney and Bullock floating in space and trying to get hold of something, so the plot mostly consist of the latter on one hand and some chit-chat to calm Ryan down on the other. Though I have to admit, the (short) action scenes are pretty good.When rating movies, I usually give every movie 5/10 from the start and then add or subtract points. I've decided to give the movie a 4/10 because: + the effects were pretty decent + realistic depiction of the space environment (with one exception) - Clooneys wooden and emotionless acting (I know, it's arguable) - irrational and non-credible behaviour - very little plot-relevant content",4,4,8,17 May 2014
Fifty Shades of Grey," Oh God why
","As probably many men before I was dragged into the movie by my girlfriend and a common friend of ours. At least I was paid both the entry and the tortillas with cheese sauce because otherwise I would have left the movie after the first 20 minutes.Note I haven't read the book so I'm only rating the move here.ACTING: I really find it hard to understand how the main roles can be cast so badly. Both Christian and Anastasia seemed to display no credible emotions until the very end. Beside that the few emotions Ana actually displayed were too cheese even for movies from the 60s. E.g. That constant lip-biting and leading the pencil to her lips can't be considered serious acting. This might have worked during the glorious times of Marilyn Monroe but today the image of a naive and innocent girl is just too outdated and not credible at all.PLOT: What plot? After we left the cinema my girlfriend actually told me she missed some major plot. The whole movie resolves around how Ana meets Christian and is more and more subdued to him until she suddenly realizes he's a sick psycho when he hits her with his belt six time at the end of the movie as a form of punishment.MESSAGE AND PG-RATING: I don't know about any other countries but the movie is rated 16 here in Germany. I seriously don't understand why. The movie clearly displays abuse of women because the obviously more sexually experienced Grey takes advantage of Anas naivety to virtually make her his sex-slave. There are several nude scenes involved where you can see bare breasts and buttocks. Just this alone should have called for an 18 rating. About the message of the movie? I don't know, but one has to be seriously naive in order to believe that a relationship like that one between Ana and Christian can actually work with one of them deciding over every aspect of their sexuality. Wasted time, there's nothing else to say here.",3,3,7,17 March 2015
The Wolverine," Pretty much disappointing compared to the other X-Men universe films.
","If you're looking for another X-Men movie, you will be disappointed. Simply because this isn't a X-Men movie. It's a Wolverine-Movie.But even then you might still get disappointed. Most of the movie is watching Wolverine get his bottom kicked by virtually everyone. The story didn't really convince me, it just seemed like the studio wanted to make quick money using the (over?)hyped iconic clawed mutant. Though there were some good plot-twists, I didn't have the feeling the story was rounded-up well and had any major point. Perhaps I'm missing something, but the lesson Logan seems to have learned during this movie could have been learned any other way and was in no correlation to the plot. Yes, I know Logan killed Jean in X-Men: Last Stand and sought solitude, but I still don't see why this movie was necessary.Especially the post-credit scene actually showed how much out of context this movie was. The other X-Men universe movies show stories and events relevant to the overall plot and general understanding of the X-Men universe. Well, this one doesn't. You literally can not watch it and there wouldn't be any piece of relevant info you'd miss.",4,1,2,20 May 2014
Toy Story 3," Worth of watching, but not necessarily worth of the cinema entry price
","Before watching the movie myself, I first read a couple of other reviews and even got surprised finding this movie no. 27 of top 250 movies. however, I don't think Toy Story 3 deserves such a high rank:The animations might not be the worst, but on the other hand they are not quite the best as well. I don't want to spoil anyone: The plot itself matches the level of a Disney movie: Not too complicated for small kids to understand, but not that interesting to keep you in front of the telly for the whole time. Nevertheless, one has to keep in mind that Toy Story 3 is mainly for children rather than adults, so it's not quite fair to compare it to adult-movies. It was entertaining at some points, but at some parts I wasn't quite sure whether something was supposed to be funny or not, so the tin-laugh would have been useful.As I said, I don't think Toy Story deserves the rating of 8.7 as compared to other movies, If you ask me it's 'worth watching', but when going to the pictures, I'd think twice if it's really worth the 10 bucks.Hence: 6/10",6,1,3,3 January 2011
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Definitely didn't disappoint, though there still was some potential for improvement
","In this review I want to purely focus on the aspects that are not relevant to the story in any way, so this is going to be SPOILER FREE.From the beginning until the end of the movie several motifs and situations can be found that just remind too much of Episode IV. The more you think about it, the more you notice the movie 'borrows' from its predecessor. This doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, as when I was watching the movie I couldn't tell what the precise outcome would be solely by having seen Episode IV. Further, especially the older Star Wars fans might feel some nostalgia due to these slight parallels. Nevertheless, the ending is predictable to some extent, by modern movie standards. There was a lot of critique regarding the prequel trilogy having made too extensive and intensive use of CGI. While watching the movie I noticed it was somehow strange and familiar at the same time, because Episode VII makes use of CGI when it's appropriate and not more. Remember those awful scenes on Kamino, Geonosis etc. ? You won't see anything like that in Episode VII. Most sets make use of natural terrain and tangible requisites. The movie takes place in a many natural environments, which has this old-school-feeling to it.The only thing I wished for the movie to do is to explain one minor plot-hole and the background of one of the more central characters, but we still have two more movies to expect.All in all the movie was very entertaining, even funny at times.May the Force be with you.",8,0,11,18 December 2015
