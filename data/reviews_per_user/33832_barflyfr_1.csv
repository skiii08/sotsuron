Come and See," Come and See the World... as it is
","Come and See.. The first time I saw it, went almost berserk within the very depths of my soul -there's far too much about feeling, understanding, witnessing and living in this movie to stay quiet and phlegmatic after having watched it. Is it the very opening of the movie that brings this state of facts, as you're told you're just poor little bastards who can't understand anything of what's going on, that you'd remember everything keeps going on and on and on without you to escape it? Is it because these first sentences I can't quote are dedicated to the young protagonist in which we will entirely penetrate? Or may it be due to the almost unreal living reality the entire movie flashes over you? That very feeling that you could have done such things, in such a situation, that every guy down here might be anything we usually like to consider as morally impossible? Will you bare the absolute passivity of civilians -if we can call 'passivity' the fact of trying to save one's life by helping anyone stronger than one is? Maybe it is just because it depicts reality as it might be -not understandable, not to be focused on, not to be made or modified as we'd like it to be, but just as something you can't escape, that stands still when you're happy, when you're suffering, and dying.. Go and watch this movie -this is for sure. Look at it as it is -a requiem for loads of massacres -the first of all being perhaps one of instinct... Go, watch this movie. And feel hard for long. Be joyful if you feel bad.",5,6,33,13 March 2006
