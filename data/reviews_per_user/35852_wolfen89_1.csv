The Blair Witch Project," you've got to see this movie
","It's great to see an intense horror with little blood and no special effects. It gets to the roots of the real horror films the basic first person image of the characters. The realism created by the hand held cameras is what makes this movie stand out. The emotions are hauntingly real. It will make you think it is real footage. And for the people who still think this is a real story, Do you remember War of the Worlds? In my opinion this is one of the best horror films ever created. You will never sleep good while camping ever again.",10,1,2,8 August 1999
