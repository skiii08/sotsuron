It," Certified horror
","Being a true fan of the original, I was apprehensive about the remake. But it somehow managed to pay homage to the original pennywise while also making it completely modernized and horrifically scary. Such a brilliant remake of a classic horror.",10,1,1,10 September 2018
Hereditary," A worthy film.
",Hereditary makes you feel mentally disturbed for ages after watching it.,8,3,5,4 January 2020
It Follows," It's a good one
",This is such a good horror. It's modern and original and still makes me shudder if I look out the window and see someone walking down the road on the dark.,8,0,0,4 January 2020
The Witch," Scariest witch film you'll see
","Watched this for the second time and it remains such a genuinely frightening film. While the olde English can initially be off putting, you get the gist of it and I think it serves to portray the primitive horror of the times (as mentioned by the notes at the end about records and diaries of witch hunts). Some parts are absolutely chilling and it's probably the most authentic and terrifying witch movie I've seen. That ending scene haunted me.",8,1,2,31 December 2019
Marriage Story," Worthy of the great reviews
","The acting here was phenomenal, first class actors. There was a particular argument scene that really struck a chord and the overall portrayal of divorce and the emotional cost was very well done. It's quite an artistic and intelligent movie that is mostly centred on dialogue, definitely worth a watch.",9,10,15,4 January 2020
