10 Cloverfield Lane," Interesting unique movie with a horrible ending
",I enjoyed this movie because it was both entertaining and exciting. The movie was a unique take on a fallout apocalyptic movie. Usually its a classic lineup of a couple strangers somehow fending off aliens or zombies so this was a good take on it. John Goodman once again was great he played his role perfect just like i expected. The whole movie you are wondering whether or not he was a crazy kidnapping psychopath or he was right about the whole attack on the world. In the end he turns out to be both which is the part I don't like. I think when she comes out of the bomb shelter and sees the birds she should of took her mask off an just looked around to see the world was normal. I think adding the whole alien fight scene and how he was right just ruined the movie. Then it draws back to the scene when she figured out that Goodman had held that other girl here captive and probably killed her. Why would they add that part if it turns out there was an attack from aliens. If it turned out he was lying that would have made the movie and the ending way better. The ending was cheesy but the movie is still worth watching.,7,0,2,18 April 2016
War Dogs," Good movie but structure is very unoriginal
",The basic structure of this movie is something we have seen before in movies like 'goodfellas' and 'wolf of Wall Street'. It's basically the same the main character as a narrator. The movie starts off somewhere in the middle for a brief scene to show you what to come and then goes back to humble beginnings. And the structure goes on the same so if you have seen those movies then except the same kind of film. Despite that unoriginal I still enjoyed the film. The acting was solid Jonah hill delivers another solid performance adding to the list of his good performances. And young miles teller shows he can act with this and his previous movie 'whiplash'. I was afraid of the movie based on the trailers being just a silly action movie but I was wrong although it had some action it was mainly an interesting story excited well. If you are fans of goodfellas and wolf of Wall Street you will enjoy this because it is very similar with a new story to tell about shady young stoners attempting to screw the government in the arms industry. I do recommend this. Parents beware there is violence and drug use are the main causes of this being rated R,8,1,1,29 August 2016
The Maze Runner," Solid movie
",This was a pretty solid movie overall. I wasn't really sure what it was about but it was definitely a different plot. It had some resemblance to the hunger games but overall was pretty different. The movie was entertaining and kept me in the whole time. It got confusing at times but that was intriguing part about it. There is a solid amount if action and you will not get bored watching this movie. If you were debating whether or not to watch this or not i do recommend it. As far as the level of appropriateness for kids its not bad a few swears hear and there but not bad. Nothing really that inappropriate. This is a good film and i recommend watching it not like a o my god movie but good.,8,0,1,11 October 2014
The Doors," Good movie
",I really enjoyed this movie. It was compelling and entertaining and exciting. I wouldn't say this movie was inaccurate like some people are saying I would say it left some pretty important parts out of Jims life. They focused on the wild side of Jim probably because it is the most entertaining and most unique. I would of liked to see more of his articulate side because he was a very smart guy. But overall it gives you a nice description of the doors and Jim and it kept me interested throughout the movie. You get to see the interesting band that the doors really were. I recommend not only to watch the movie but to listen to the great band the doors.,9,1,1,6 May 2015
The Revenant," Great movie
","This movie was awesome it had everything you could want from it. Multiple themes from the plot, great acting from Leo but really tom hardy stole the show, thrill, intense action and battle scenes, and a ton of gore sometimes too much to watch but it was awesome either way. Multiple themes showing on what man is willing to do to survive the I humane things that they may do. It has the base story of revenue after being left for dead. And the multiple 'turf' despite a between more than one Native American tribe and Europeans and white Americans. These disputes lead to gory intense battles that had some very disturbing and almost scary scenes. The key to the action sequences in this movie was the camera work. The camera angles were unbelievable making you feel as if you were freezing in those terrible conditions fighting brutally Native American tribes coming at you. This movie was very good and I highly recommend you go see it with warning that is disgustingly gory at times beyond your imagination. I believe Leo could get his Oscar for this one.",8,2,7,8 January 2016
Django Unchained," One of tarentinos best
","What a movie I loved it so much. There is so much fantastic action in it, you will never be bored. There is a lot of blood and gore but that is just tarentinos style. Jamie Fox is so good in this movie as he is in every movie he plays in. What a plot too no just action but great plot and fantastic acting. Some cool lines throughout the movie and I also like Samuel L. Jackson in it to. But I can't forget Leonardo decapro he should of got the Oscar for this and a few other movies he was in too. Once again he was magnificent and definitely made the movie better. But so did jamie fox. This movie overall is one of the best of the 2000s and deserves the high rating it got. A great ending to the movie to but I won't give anything away. when I read the description I thought it would be to much of a romance movie but not at all just good acting, a good plot, and lots of action. also there was a bit of hidden gem with a little comedy in the movie. There was a few laughs throughout the movie. This movie reminded me a lot of Pulp Fiction. I highly recommend this film.",10,0,3,2 August 2013
Good Will Hunting," Wicked good
","This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I loved it so much, I watch it over and over again. This is an excellent film about a man who is an absolute math genius who could do anything as a job, but refuses to because of the demons he has in his mind. I love how good all of the characters are like Will(Matt Damon), Chuck(Ben Affleck), Sean(Robin Williams), and skylah(MInnie Driver). Matt and Ben's best film of their career. It goes through the horrible abuse Will Hunting faced as a child and how he overcomes it. We also find out late in the film that Sean the therapist also dealt with some abuse as a child. My favorite line is when will starts out by saying 'he used to just set a belt, a stick, and a wrench on the table and say choose' then Sean says 'I would have to go with the belt' then will says 'no I used to go with the wrench' Sean says'why' will says 'cause f*** him thats why'. Will was talking about his foster father because he used to be an orphan.Greatly scripted film and an unbelievable story.",10,1,3,27 February 2013
Snowden," Good interesting film
",The people reviewing this film are the same people who r view poorly to every Oliver stone film ever. You probably will see their username on movies like JFK or Nixon or the doors or something saying he expanded the truth and over dramatized the story. This film literally says at the beginning that it is over dramatized. That's why this is a Hollywood movie and not a documentary. People say Snowden himself would be ashamed of this movie oh really that's why he met with Joseph Gordon's-Levitt in person. That's why on his Twitter he is promoting the film and even using it as a reference. Wherever you agree with what he did or not this movie is with watching it gives you a first hand perception of what was going on in his head. The whole point of him revealing this info was to let the propel know and decide if it was wrong he believed the people should be fully aware and if they don't like it use the power of the people (John Lennon) to stop it. The movie is well done without getting too technical or computer terminology and just giving you the information and the story. Yes there is some expanded truth and overdramatazation but it still is a good movie and I recommend seeing it.,8,12,24,17 September 2016
Love & Mercy," Great and Dramatic Biopic
","Of course you see haters of this movie and the biopic genre in general. I mean come one look at all the famous music biopics The Doors, Ray, Walk the Line, Im not there, Sid and Nancy. They all have ratings below 8. People are way too picky about these things. This one was especially great in my mind because it was dramatic and had very good acting. Im not a huge fan of the beach boys in general i don't dislike them just not a big fan but I loved this movie. 'its not linear what good art stands for' ~ Ray Manzareck from the doors. It bounces back and forth between 1960s and 1980s Brian Wilson which both actors killed the role. Very interesting story of a man basically slowly going insane. I recommend this for not only classic rock fans but movie fans this is an excellent biopic. You get to enter the world of one of musics most bright visionaries and see his peak and how he slowly enslaves himself in his own mind through drugs, his past, and his obsession with beating the Beatles.",9,3,5,21 June 2016
Whiplash," Shocked about how good this was
",This was a great movie and it totally shocked me. I was like OK maybe it will be alright because everyone was saying how great it was and when I watched it I was shocked. The intensity and the drama was great. The acting was awesome in this movie J.K Simmons is great in everything he does from Oz to the State Farm commercials. The ending was awesome. I was excited and intrigued the entire movie it never became dull. I say this or the imitation game should of won best picture. How the hell did bird man beat this movie out that movie was mediocre at best this movie was great. I highly recommend it especially if you play jazz band yourself. This is a truly great movie and I was totally shocked how good it was.,9,1,2,9 July 2015
Platoon," Deserves way more than an 8.2
","This movie was downright unbelievable. Very well done and kept you interested throughout the entire movie. It shows the horribleness that went on in Vietnam and how it was truly a life changing experience. The veterans over there went through very little sleep and had to go through fear almost every parts of the day. I personally did not go in the Vietnam war but from what I heard this is the most realistic movie of what happened in Vietnam. The ambush scene where Taylor is just waiting in fear with his hear pounding that the Vietnam soldiers would not see him. I also love the final battle scene it had lots of action and was very intriguing. When Elias was running from the soldiers was a very emotional scene. Charlie Sheen was magnificent along with Forrest Whittaker, Willam Defoe, Tom Berenger, and others. Taylor had to witness murder, rape, and injustice by his fellow soldiers or as he put it 'he couldn't tell what was right or wrong anymore. It was truly grew and I highly recommend it.",10,5,6,28 February 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Very satisfying movie
",To the hater people who think they are 'real' Star Wars fans hating on this film and the prequels you just don't appreciate what they are their for. Prequels are cool way of explaining events you heard about in the original trilogy but never understood. This movie is very stays dying exactly what I wanted it to be. A perfect blend of using today's technology to liven up some eye candy but also focusing on the plot. There were some pretty obvious similarities to episode 4 but enough different where I wasn't to angry about it. A key aspect they did in this film was they had plenty of surprises and you were always on your toes. This film also does the perfect amount of connections to the old film without going overboard. I really enjoyed this not one of the best Star Wars ever but very good and I was happy with it.,8,3,15,17 December 2015
