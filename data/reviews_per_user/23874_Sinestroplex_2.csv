The Ring," Waste of Time
","This Review May Contain Small Spoilers (they may actually save you the time you waste if you do see the movie anyway because at least then you may get a laugh in). When I first saw previews for The Ring I was rather intrigued. I read a summary on line and the idea of a people dying from watching a videotape was new to me so I decided to check it out. However, when I saw this movie in the theaters i was bored, unimpressed, and even a little let down. The actors couldn't act and the only thing that made them stand out from the actual set was the fact they were either dying or screaming. A lot of the movie was taken up with flashbacks that eventually lead to us realizing how the tape was created and why people die when they watch it. The style of going backwards in a movie to piece together a story that sucks never succeeds and is just wasting your time. The Ring is supposed to be a horror movie but there is little to be horrified with. Every now and then there will be one of those some dead girl screaming somewhere in a tight space like a closet or a well which only helps you stay awake for more stupidity. The special effects were lame and the behind the scenes crew were lazy. More than once I saw things left in the background including even an actual worker for the crew. Overall this was a lousy movie and a waste of time. Do not see this movie unless you like to be bored or you like to be disappointed. I was disappointed when I saw The Ring and it really dampened my faith in ghost stories.",3,0,7,15 April 2006
Spider-Man," Good but not great
","Whether you've read the comics or watched the TV show, spider-man has been everyones favorite wise guy superhero. His powers unique, the villains wondrous, and the whole concept of an average guy saving the world are what built this superhero's legacy. When I heard they were making a Spiderman movie I was just as excited as anyone. However, while I enjoyed the movie, I couldn't stop thinking to myself 'Was that really worth it'. Sure the movie portrayed his beginning well, but something seemed wrong with it. Then I realized it, Tobey Maguire just doesn't make a good spider-man. As Peter Parker, Tobey demonstrates the 'science genius' and the whole 'self-constrained-never-on-time-for-anything' thing accurately, he just lacks acting capabilities to portray a superhero with such a huge reputation. Actors like Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson were needed to keep this movie from flopping. Willem Dafoe was the perfect choice for Spiderman's arch enemy the Green Goblin and couldn't have played the part better. Cliff Robertson was excellent as Ben Parker and even though he was only in it for a short part of the movie, he really allowed audiences to feel apart of the movie and not just watching acting. I'm not saying Spiderman was a bad movie because I liked it overall, but I am saying that it was rushed and it did not live up to the true potential it had.",7,0,1,14 April 2006
