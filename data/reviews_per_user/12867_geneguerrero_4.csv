10 Cloverfield Lane," Packed with a slow, boring story and absolutely no mystery
","10 Cloverfield Lane is the follow-up to 2008's much superior film Cloverfield about alien monsters invading God's green earth! Now why I say the first one was much more superior was because it was faster in terms of pace and action, the mystery and suspense was much better, and the story had more atmosphere of hopelessness and intrigue. Here in the 2016 follow-up, the story follows three characters trapped in a house with chaos going on in the outside world which we never see and the whole time you're sitting there thinking 'Ok, anytime now for the action. I don't care how deeply torn these characters are or what their motivation is. I want to see some action' or 'how many more minutes until this movie ends?' The director bit many parts from current filmmakers in this one. From the beginning, I noticed Zack Snyder's 2004 'Dawn of the Dead' opening so I wasn't really excited there. Then James Wan's 'Saw' was also thrown into the mix so the mystery just couldn't be more obvious: a girl is trapped in a house...but why!? No surprises or thrills in this one. The ending was a bit laughable. So don't waste your $2 rental at the Red Box. You're better off renting Kindergarten Cop 2 to keep your kids busy.",2,0,2,9 July 2016
The Conjuring 2," Disturbing, horrific, and intense
","Ed and Lorraine Warren are back this time in England to investigate a family's claim of unexplained supernatural events occurring right in their very own home. From the opening sequence of the film, the scares start rolling and is carefully paced by returning director James Wan. The scary scenes are intense and unexpected which makes it one fun ride. And the acting was believable. From the leads to the supporting cast, it was top-notch acting. All in all, The Conjuring 2 is a great sequel and overall film. Definitely ranks up there with one of the scariest movies all-time. I recommend watching this one in the theater for the sound, imagery, and experience.",10,0,3,21 June 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," BvS - Boredom versus Sleepy
","Let's just start with the good OK fanboys? Visually it was nice. I like how the makers wanted to distinguish themselves different from the colorful Marvel movies. I didn't mind the dark tone look to the movie. It's a fight, it's not supposed to be pretty and colorful. And I liked Ben Affleck as Batman. He did a good job with bringing the mystery and a brooding presence to the character. But that was pretty much it for me. The action was good in some parts just not all the way like you would expect from a 'Superhero vs. Superhero' movie. The pacing of the story was a bit all over the place and the build-up to the confrontation between Batman and Superman could've been better. It was no where near exciting. The tension between Jason and Freddy Krueger was much better (Yes, I said it). I'd rather watch Freddy vs. Jason more than once than this. As a matter a fact, I have the DVD for it. But back to the flaws of Batman V. Superman. I think the franchise could've made more money if they saved the Doomsday villain for another movie. It seemed rushed and made Batman look like a coward for not helping Superman on time. It's like he was waiting for Superman to be destroyed by Doomsday which brings me to another flaw in the film. That other flaw is the scene where Batman finally realizes why he wants to help Superman - because they both have a mother who shares the same name. Didn't make sense to me and just like a lot of other people, I caught myself saying 'Oh come on!' The focus should've solely been on why Superman and Batman are battling and how the World is torn by the two superheroes colliding. Instead, it carried this dark-depressing and uninteresting feel to the movie and tried to be something more than extraordinary. And don't let me get started on the portrayal of Lex Luthor. Wasn't he the dude on Superbad?",4,1,2,26 August 2016
Godzilla," A Dark, Boring Mess
","I'm gonna use the minimum requirement for writing a review on this movie because frankly, there isn't really much to say about this boring movie. I give this Godzilla the three B's: bland, boring, and bullsh*t. When the action scenes happened, it was hard to tell what was going on because it was so dark. The story was so slow, waiting at the DMV seems more entertaining and action packed. Actually waiting at the DMV is pretty entertaining. I do it when I don't have to. People watching is so fun at the DMV. Anywho, back to this review. Acting was predictable and uninspiring. The ending made you say, 'I actually paid to see this movie?' Matthew Broderick should've returned to save this one.",1,1,1,18 November 2016
