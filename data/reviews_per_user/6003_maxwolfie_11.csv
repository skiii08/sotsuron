It," As expected
","Nothing new here. Just another shallow slasher flick. For most of the film I felt like I was watching a young teen's adventure flick (apart from the gory bits, of course).",5,0,0,19 March 2020
Hereditary," I expected more
","A decent flick, however I feel as though it doesn't offer anything new. To be honest it was a little difficult for me to figure out exactly what was happening. Still certainly worth watching.",7,0,1,19 March 2020
Train to Busan," Decent but not necessarily memorable
",Worth a watch though I was left with the conclusion that I probably wouldn't jump for another viewing.,6,1,4,8 April 2020
The Babadook," Nothing new, but still done well
","While The Babadook does not really bring any new ideas to the table, it is a well executed film and is certainly worthy of your time.",7,2,3,19 March 2020
Us," A fresh plot
",Us is a movie that offers a fresh plot to the genre. Certainly worth seeing.,8,2,6,19 March 2020
The Others," A worthy flick
","A decent movie with a solid performance from Nicole. The main issue I have with it though is that it didn't really offer anything new to the genre. It did, however, have a decent twist and therefore I've given it a slightly higher rating.",6,0,0,20 March 2020
Split," Outstanding
","Preface:I'll be honest. I watched this film without even realising it was part of a trilogy, and the second title at that. I did watch Unbreakable quite some time ago. It was a memorable movie and I am excited to watch it again now that I've seen Split.
Review as a stand alone movie:Simply brilliant. Thought provoking. It left me pondering the potential abilities of the mind. As a stand alone movie, you can be assured that it is entirely disconnected from the first movie apart from a very small section of the film. It can therefore be viewed on it's own should you wish.",9,0,0,21 March 2020
The Shining," A timeless classic
",The Shining is still one of the best. Always worth another watch if it's been a while.,10,1,2,19 March 2020
Get Out," A masterpiece
",This is an exceptional movie in al respects. Highly recommended.,9,1,2,20 April 2020
Midsommar," Fantastically unsettling
",Midsommar is a brilliantly executed movie that is both refreshing and unsettling. A must see.,9,3,9,19 March 2020
The Cabin in the Woods," Did not live up to expectations
","As a generic slasher, it's average at best. As anything else, it severely disappoints. I barely managed to see this one through. Don't waste your time.",4,5,7,19 March 2020
