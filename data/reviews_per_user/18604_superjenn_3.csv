The Ring," RING (1998) still reigns supreme
","No number of remakes will surpass the original Japanese film, 'Ring,' which was the most original, frightening film I've seen yet.  I actually had to sleep on a friend's floor after watching it.  Shame on the Hollywood remake! The story loses so much grace and horror when superimposed onto Western culture.  Why don't we try to remake 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' while we're at it? Why not set it in Maine?If you ever intend to watch the former, certainly more artful version (and tragically, many will not because they don't want to exhaust themselves by reading subtitles), do not ruin the experience for yourself by first watching the remake.",Null,1,2,2 October 2002
The Others," Slow, but it kept the movie from seeming contrived
","Briefly: comparisons to The Sixth Sense, while warranted, are unnecessary. The Sixth Sense was a mediocre film with an ending that - as worded by the New Yorker - made the audience think they had just seen a better movie than they actually had.The Others is vastly better, combining elements of atmosphere, sound, mysterious dialogue, &c.  Nicole Kidman, by whom I am seldom impressed, was amazing as a woman clearly gone off her rocker.  Two talented kids, a cameo by Eccleston, and three servants-gone-Goth later, we are granted an elegant, no-cheap-shots suspense story that literally made the audience I sat among both audibly gasp and outright scream.  Not bad for a movie that does so little - The Others, criticized for plodding along at a terribly slow rate, does seem to shuffle its feet at times.  But to the movie's credit, the story simply sits back and lets scary things happen here and there, at their own pace.  As a result, not a single instant seems contrived: the audience always has time to catch up with the rest of the characters.Perhaps you'll figure out what's going on before the rest of the audience. If so, good for you, now shut up, enjoy the movie, and stop telling the person next to you what's going to happen next - you might be surprised.",Null,0,0,12 August 2001
Resident Evil," pretty entertaining flick
","Resident Evil is not a horror film.  It is a zombie flick.  And it is based on the intriguing idea behind a video game.With this in mind, I rented the movie with my best friend.  After hours of having sat behind my boyfriend in boredom while he played Resident Evil on Dreamcast, I wasn't expecting much.  However, as several other reviewers have said, this was a welcome surprise.Milla Jovovich is more than adequate as a heroine, and the plot thickens as is appropriate for an action flick.  What works in the movie's favor is that it actually feels like a video game.  There is atmosphere and pressure, thumping climactic music, zero character development, dialogue pared down to the essentials, lots of shooting, lots of action, lots of locations, lots of zombies... all the comforts of Playstation, without having to move your thumb!What genuinely moved me was the direction of this movie.  The truly artful aspects of cinematography, sound, music, atmosphere, mist, slow pans... everything contributed to the sensory experience.  Nice job.  It's not Mozart, but it'll do.  Break out the popcorn.",Null,0,0,14 August 2002
