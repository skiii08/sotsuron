Source Code," A lot of fiction, but no science
","Good science fiction takes one aspect of reality and turns it into something new, and then looks what follows from that. Bad science fiction is just fiction - it screws up everything and throws science out of the window. This movie belongs to the second type. I am a big science fiction fan, and I find it very frustrating when it doesn't deliver on the science part. ---Spoilers--- The hero can somehow get the memories of someone who died in a train wreck - OK. But then he cannot have any other memories - he cannot see anything the deceased did not see. He cannot find a bomb in the bathroom which the deceased never saw. It just doesn't make sense. I know, many people would answer: Hey, it's just a movie. Sure, but it's supposed to be a science fiction movie, when in fact it is just another stupid action flick with a love interest, spiced up with some mystery crap. Really, really disappointing.",Null,0,1,5 August 2011
