Vertigo," Great Classic
","Hitchcock's powerful and stunning portrayal of a twisted man's psyche is chilling yet hits a chord among the common human thread of identity, longing and self-destruction. The movie's themes transcend time to apply universally to the human experience even today. I would recommend it watching it when your ready to dissect a masterpiece and re-watch just to capture it's brilliance. This is a classic that I wouldn't want to miss. It shows you the depth and layers of the human experience that only an outstanding movie like Vertigo can bring about. Play special attention to the opening sequence and make sure you don't miss a word.",9,2,3,1 August 2014
