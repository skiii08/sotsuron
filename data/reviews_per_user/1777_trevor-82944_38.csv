The Lobster," The Near Future is Not as Sexy as we Once Thought
","If you go on the website for The Lobster, it has a wonderfully clever way of introducing you to the film, as well as what the film is all about. As soon as you enter the site, it will ask you a series of questions that will determine what second-chance animal you should pick if you do not find love. At the end of the brief quiz, you will be given three choices based on your answers. From there, you have to pick one, and that's the animal you have to turn into if you do not find the right mate in forty-five days. From there, you can have a second- chance at love as a dog, cat, fish, flamingo, or whatever. My three animals I ended up with was a bison, gorilla, and horse. Of which one I decided to turn into, that is for you to find out.This strange consideration of our sex life perfectly sums up everything talked about in the European satirical drama, The Lobster, with a call to revision on how an aristocratic society controls our path to satisfaction with a significant other.What's shocking is that this dystopian world does not look far off from where we are now. Considering our high expectations surrounding sexual preference and gender roles, filmmakers in Europe knew that it was time to make a psychodrama like this to depict how our revision of sexual stimulation will change in the next few years.Within this future, we are put in the shoes of David, a loner abandoned by his wife who has become numb over time to light and noise. In fact, neither he nor anyone else in his life show any hint of feeling at all. A calming narration by a mystery woman tells about how he is left to live in a hospital with restricting rules: he can't keep any of his personal belongings, he must wear one of their identical change of clothes, and within his forty-five day stay there, he must find love with another woman, or be turned into the animal of his choosing. In this case, he chose a lobster for its long lifespan. Whoever the narrator of this story is meant to be, by the film's final moments, the cruciality of the voice's identity will become clear.In this unsettling world, change for healthy relationships is initiated as they teach the men that they must be dependent on a lover, and the women are taught how their safety is dependent on a man. The staff even goes as far as punishing secret masturbators with a toaster to the hand. If there are any loners hiding out in the moss-infested woods nearby, they are captured by patients with tranquilizer darts and sent to the well-maintained seaside hospital.The surreal nature of this motion picture feels complete with a disruptive baroque musical, creating a haunting beat you will never remove from your memory. It evokes the lack of apparent fear, making the peacocks and camels seen wandering the woods feel expectant. The only change of thought the characters ever express is when a brother-turned-dog meets an unfortunate fate, and a girl's failed suicide attempt. It turns out though that creating a world without feeling generates all sorts of challenges for even the greatest of cinema artists.While the characters certainly don't feel much, neither does the audience. A motion picture like this one ought to show master over orchestrating the audience to feel what the character's don't, which The Lobster does not fully succeed at. It gets harder to keep up with everything as well with the second half, when everything becomes practically a different type of movie with new characters and a new setting.But it doesn't make The Lobster any less brilliant in its call to reconsideration of our own emotions. Director Yorgos Lanthimos makes it plainly clear how animals these days have a healthier concept of romance than we people do, as the turnaround of one man chained by unnecessary rules speaks to us.",7,0,2,16 September 2016
Blade Runner 2049," Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...
","What separates real from machine? Do androids dream of electric sheep? Do we still think that humanity will someday crumble into a robot dystopia? Why do we still ask ourselves these obvious questions?Blade Runner 2049 brings us to thirty years after the 1982 classic. If you love the original Blade Runner, then you may appreciate Harrison Ford as he reprises his old role, this time as a motivator for the supposedly replicant protagonist, detective K, played by Ryan Gosling (Drive, La La Land). Similar to his previous project, Arrival, director Denis Villeneuve attempts a philosophical study on the worth of humanity, except now resulting in a pointless anti-fantasy with no true knowledge about civilization.Most of the film's praise focuses on production designer Dennis Gassner's (Bugsy, The Truman Show) creation of the sunless Californian city's atmosphere, which it deserves. Between the desolate hell-red wasteland riddled by statues and the neon shades of evil corporations, immense spectacle commands the screen. The use of symbolic holograms within the city is particularly noteworthy, as a ballerina hologram three stories tall parades through the streets, and a nude pink hooker five stories tall rules over the solitary life; even inside the city walls, an Elvis concert juxtaposes a fist fight. Although more so than the visuals, the sound design sucks you into the experience the most—in the first scene, Villeneuve utilizes his silent storytelling skills with K at work in a protein farm, where the hard murder of a replicant takes place. Once K enters the city, the IMAX surround sound creates the big, unfamiliar world accompanied by a shrieking musical score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch (Hidden Figures). You indeed feel caught in this cyberpunk future.However, the visuals hardly redeem the flaws, due to little effort made to modernize the decades old material. Villeneuve draws no inspiration from our current values, with social media and all, in turn making the original look more dated in its incorrectly predicted philosophical ideas. In fact, this whole city exaggerates our lesser-prevalent problems to improbable levels without explaining precisely how human error led to the ecosystem's collapse. ​ The excessive three-hour runtime contains 15% beautiful imagery and 85% chitchat in standardly lit sets; the average person might be able to follow these overused slow conversations without a single yawn if the villains were more multi-dimensional. The screenplay ironically says, 'memory is feeling,' yet no feeling exists here, so you too will fail to remember whatever it tries to communicate. ​ Part of the problem to the atrocious boredom goes to the lackluster dialogue—after a standard text straight-forward tells you the backstory, everyone acts as a tool to spill out philosophical rambles. Since no tension builds, our mindset identifies these individuals as human shaped phone apps rather than expressive minds.The entire production crew overall showed little respect to regular moviegoers; cinema should never be about self-satisfaction, but about telling a great story that speaks to anybody at a spiritual level. The ego stroking of the picture primarily shows in its character motive: a fatherhood subplot gets thrown in without enough prevalence, and a significant other for K arrives and leaves without any resolution, so the entire subject of love, both familial and romantic, needed much more presence. Humanity and love complete one another, so why would such a heartless directorial approach impact our souls?Even more ironically, a heartthrob actor, one who has embraced materialism throughout his career, plays the lead. Consequently, he was a dreadful choice for the uncastable role: Ryan Gosling never reacts to the miraculous events around him, he just stares blankly as he recites his lines off a cue card.One last detail disproves Blade Runner 2049 as a sci-fi masterpiece: it plagiarizes. If you already saw this movie, then you might have noticed that K's name, a codename assigned to him at birth, resembles Star Wars: The Force Awakens., or that it ripped off a true modern sci-fi masterpiece, Her, when the holographic girlfriend uses a flesh-and- blood girl to sleep with K (essentially telling girls to submit their control to technology). So sorry, nothing new is said other than we people deserve to feel discouraged.Now, to answer my starter questions: People are real, machines are inanimate, androids never dream, because only people dream, and humanity can never crumble to basically resemble robots. Look at Facebook: things still look pretty dang expressive compared to the original Blade Runner's incorrect theories, so the future seems more hopeful than we give ourselves credit for.",4,7,15,13 October 2017

It," These Dang Kids Need to Stop Clowning Around!
","Clowns look pretty freaky, right? I remember feeling quite unnerved by them in my younger days, yet as I got older, clowns intimidated me less. To be frank, clowns land more along the lines of 'creepy' rather than scary, unlike real unmasked people who could hurt you.It's familiar opening scene captures that true scariness: an unsupervised small boy takes a paper boat out on a rainy day, which falls down the sewer drain. A clown peers his head up from below the darkness, his appearance throwing the boy off guard. He displays unusual kindness to the boy, returning to him the lost paper boat. Then suddenly, the predator chews the boy's arm off, and a God's eye view looks down on his poor defenseless body flowing into the drain, a truly disturbing sight in this otherwise misguided adaptation of Stephen King's classic novel.Now, I understand the movie's current rave, as It now stands at 90% on RottenTomatoes, and YouTube celebrity Chris Stuckmann gave It an A-, but I for one differ from the public opinion.Although the critical praise does speak some truth; each preteen we meet goes through change in some way. The sewer-bound kid's stuttering brother, Bill, is shunned by everybody, and his friends each face their personal growing pains too. Eddie is forced against his will to keep taking meds, Richie resents whatever his friends tell him to do, and Stanley refuses to pursue his family's Jewish beliefs. Other friends they make include a Black farmer boy, Mike, who must kill sheep for his heartless father, Ben, an overweight new kid who needs friends outside of the books, and Beverly, a gorgeous flame-haired drug addict. Her father creates by far the creepiest moments, as he sniffs her hair like some sex offender. The horror should stem from places like here, the common fears every teenager shares.Instead, the inexperienced director, Andy Muschietti, abused Dutch angles and motion sickness while filming the 'scary' moments. He followed the common misconception that low lighting adds to the fright, which in actuality hurt the thrill here since you now cannot tell what is supposed to scare you. Think about some of the most iconic shots in horror: The shower scene in Psycho, the twins in The Shining, Jack Nicholson in the same movie shouting 'Here's Johnny!', or even in the original It when Pennywise pops out from beneath the pale-tinted shower. Notice a theme? These images are each evenly lit, anything hidden in the shadows contrasting against something else to fear. Truly effective horror fills in the unknown blanks based on what you think you already see. Maybe if Muschietti utilized real fears, such as a community's religious state, other than clichés, and knew how to stage them, then these scares could leave a longer impression to the extent of The Exorcist.The scares particularly fail more due to the atrocious casting of the child actors. Whenever the kids were supposed to act afraid, they just stared blankly and walked stiltly. Even outside the scary scenes, the kids either talked too fast or too slow while screaming their lines when supposed to act angry. Based on speculation, these annoying kids obviously achieved their chemistry by following tape marks and cue cards with the direction, 'Just say your lines and go home.' These kids' stories also lack any structural balance. The brother-to- brother bond initiated right at the start gets forgotten across a large portion, especially at the very last scene; and Stanley's Jewish struggles loses any footing with little to do compared to the stronger treatment of his friends. As for the bullies, their interesting backstories receive an undeservingly low amount of screen time, instead existing more for lazy predictable scenarios we've seen countless times.Very little fear strikes your nerve in these moments, as you can never empathize with these kids' foul-mouthed tendencies. Rather than showing the hard reality of growing up, the kids celebrate their hatred against the oppressors. It even attempts to beautify the one female preteen, Beverly, as much as possible, as she jumps into a lake wearing only her underwear, then lets her new boyfriends gawk at her body as she naps in their eyesight. Then in another dialogue played only for laughs, a pharmacist, who she says looks like Clark Kent, comments her back, saying she looks like Lois Lane! Honestly, the whole beautification of her character made me feel pedophilic myself.I read several reports that the clowning industry has suffered because of It, promoting coulrophobia, I find this hard to believe. It does not feed off coulrophobia, but rather anthropophobia, particularly predatorial parents. No wonder the Alamo Drafthouse theaters in Austin and Brooklyn hosted all-clown screenings, since clearly, we might as well root for the demonic circus act to win!",4,22,44,8 September 2017
Detroit," The Most Important Study of Our Own Failure
","Before my screening of Detroit played, the trailers shown beforehand featured these dumb action movies with bad CGI, you know, the ones expected to score box office success. Boy did it feel refreshing to see what I went to the theater for: a thriller based on a thought-provoking true story about how little has changed since the incident at the Algiers Motel.First, a stylized prologue educates us on the public 1967 mindset by painting out the prior 100 years of racial history. The colorful film reel fit for an elementary classroom then time-warps us into the riots stirred up by Civil Rights, no sugarcoating included. The Black community embraced unlicensed after-hours club for the initiators of violence. The White police officers reacted to the rebellion by scaring them with death games. In any other director's hands, this project would have turned out as hate-fueled anti-White propaganda much like The Birth of a Nation or Get Out; rather, director Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty) and her team made great strides to tell the real story of what happened in Detroit.Everything within the first charcoal-tinted twenty minutes brings sense into Detroit's economic structure of the time. With each bike stolen, with each fire set ablaze, with each fireman injured by a thrown rock, with each Black woman sexually harassed by an officer, with each piece of real historical news footage, the attention closes in on the personal conflict within the riot rather than the spectacle itself. Although the usage of religious institutions deserved stronger prevalence across the entire runtime to match the moral strife of the time, the big picture still explodes with a great undying flame.True to Bigelow's traditional style, a documentary approach records the dramatized events. Despite an unnecessary musical score by James Newton Howard (The Fugitive, Michael Clayton), a grainy Steadicam stressfully complements the sudden edit cuts, transferring the 1967 motion sickness into your own eyeballs.The tension really sets its spark ablaze during the entire middle chunk: a motel-set interrogation in search for a blank-loaded gun aimed at the police outside. These victims, two of them Ohio-local White prostitutes, the rest young Black men, face the worst of Detroit's hate over the next hour and a half. The one holding the gun is shot dead, nobody knows the gun's whereabouts, yet the cops only see an easy chance to humiliate the weak one by one.Every performer gives their greatest effort, the most impactful being a respectful Army Veteran who to the police is no different than any other negro. But Larry, a struggling musician also harassed that dreadful night, adds the most soul to our soulless history. The two whores receive the same poor treatment as their Black companions, lovingly supporting each other even after one gets stripped nude by a cop. While their stories lack their full potential, standing more as victims than empowering female role models, their sentimentality despite their destructive lifestyles make it easy for women to connect with. As with the other Black victims, none of them were motivated enough to cheer on, yet you can still tell them each apart simply by looking at their wardrobe.By now, I believe screenwriter Mark Boal (The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty) just proved himself to be the most underrated writer in Hollywood today, as he achieved great heights to the artform by writing under a variety of styles, including courtroom drama, real time, and visual storytelling. His intense dialogue helps us to physically feel the situation without coming off as one-sided. He structures the multiple events so that every death hits you hard in the right timing, as true to the expressed motives we learn about each character, whether Black or White.The issues seen here at Detroit looks upsettingly familiar to the anti- Trump riots we see today, almost normalized on a daily basis as it was back then. However, hope manages to lie within its social message: no stereotypes raise their ugly head, not all Blacks involved in the riots are mean spirited, and not all cops are racists. The different social groups stand up for one another and some even stand up for the other side, in a story everybody over the age of eighteen needs to know at once, especially now during the summer season.So bottom line, this history lesson matters to you: Black or White, male or female, young or old, innocent or guilty!",8,15,41,4 August 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Unneeded, But Strong With the Force
","Okay, so the first spin off of the immortal Star Wars saga has finally hit theaters, but how does it compare to the rest? Well, it's miles ahead of those embarrassing prequels (no surprise), but Rogue One: A Star Wars Story just can't compete with the originals, or The Force Awakens. ​ As I'm sure you've heard, there's no opening crawl or John Williams score this time, just a silent view of space with a single planet. Everything else from here is an X-wing flight of an experience you'd expect from a Star Wars movie, including booming sound effects and AT-AT walkers that look as epic as ever. There's an appropriate mix of practical sets and good CGI to create all sorts of new settings, including a tropical planet and a claustrophobic prison. It's got all the checklist requirements to make a good Star Wars movie, but there's something missing.Basically, without giving anything away, the Death Star is in its finishing stages of development, and war zones land on all areas of conspiracy against the weapon, the strife of war affects the lowest of the low in the galaxy. But we are introduced to the struggle on a rock and moss planet that houses a small family of farmers. The father is forcefully invited to join the Empire, along with his wife and daughter. He is soon taken away, and the little girl manages to escape, only to be transported place to place by an Imperial prison as an adult.Now, she ends up with the Rebel Alliance so that she can be this movie's 'feminist protagonist' in helping steal the plans to the Death Star, and also to see her father again. You know how it all goes from here.The problem I had with this movie is not just in how we already know how it will end before it even begins, but in the excessive use of characters with so little humanity I cannot connect with a single one of them.Think of it this way: you remember how in The Force Awakens we saw a detailed introduction to Rey that showed us what her day-to-day life on Jakku was like? Remember the clear backstory given to Finn and how that motivated his actions? Here, none of the new characters have any of that. Jyn's not motivated enough to fight for what she has lost, as we never know what her relationship with her father was ever like. Then she starts to cry over this inner pain, and let me tell you: Felicity Jones (Like Crazy, The Theory of Everything) is not skilled in making crocodile tears. Her story just moves by too quickly to balance a feel of hope with letting us feel for her.Everyone else around her is just a plot device. While Forest Whitaker's (The Butler, The Last King of Scotland) new cyborg character has a sympathetic redemption story screaming to get out, the poor performance of the man behind the mask just doesn't land. Then there's the cameos of characters from the original trilogy. Remember how the appearances of older characters in The Force Awakens actually advanced the emotional story and improved your appreciation of the originals? This does none of that. Darth Vader does appear as epic as ever, but he just comes to explain the plot, and leaves, only to make one more brief appearance. There are a couple of others from the originals who appear, but none of them are very satisfying or necessary. Although there was one cameo that just blew my mind, making me go, 'Whoa! How did the visual effects crew make that possible?!'But there is a god, strong saving grace though: one of the new characters proves to be strong with the force, despite it being a time when the force is thought of as an ancient religion. He's also blind, and an epic master of hand-to-hand combat. Let me tell you: he gets a moment to shine in his fight against a gaggle of Stormtroopers, and it's the most amazing thing ever.So is Rogue One: A Star Wars Story the spin off to the saga we all hoped for? Not exactly. It's a satisfactory action flick if you're willing not to think too hard about it as high art. But if you are looking for the essential Star Wars experience that surpasses all of your expectations, you might end up disappointed.",6,0,5,16 December 2016
Thor: Ragnarok," Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
","Woo-hoo! Three Marvel movies in one year! Everyone's been celebrating 2017 as perhaps the best year for comic book movies in history, with every single one thus far either meeting or exceeding expectations. I understand the hype, as like the last couple of movies in the MCU, Thor: Ragnarok features lots of good comic timing thanks to director Taika Waititi's (Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows) effort in staging sound to time each gag. The excitement goes nonstop as the hero fights demon after demon against screaming rock music to put the final cherry on the sundae.The continuation of the heroes' journeys will expectedly keep committed fans raising their foam fingers of approval; when we first see Thor, he is chained over lava, face to face with a fiery demon, but without a hint of fear. When he meets his evil sister, she breaks his sacred hammer, and he's later pit into a gladiator arena against a familiar green face, escalating the thrills with each new spectacle. The Incredible Hulk even has his own great moments faithful to when we last saw him, particularly in how he remained green and mean for the past two years.But that doesn't excuse Ragnarok's empty sense of humanity. The lack of consistency essentially starts with Thor's father passively dying, leaving his evil daughter to rule over Asgard, a 'sad' moment standing as a mere plot motive with no hint of trauma. As for the Hulk, what exactly does he think about forgetting the last two years of his life? Apparently nothing, as all his self-doubt gets insultingly contradicted in his final moments on screen. A couple of other new members join Thor's team, including Valkyrie. Right upon her introduction, she falls off a platform drunk, setting off a damaged amount of sympathy for her shallowness that carries on with every other new character thrown in without consideration.For a majority of the feature, each supporting individual says their exact thoughts in service to exposition, even at the cost of satisfying closure to their stories. While I certainly learned plenty about what these new characters are, I learned little about who they are beyond funny caricatures. These characters needed to be more than comic relief against flashy colors to last longer than a month in audience's memories. The laws of physics and social order make as much sense as the humanity, appearing a little too conscious about who needs to stay alive and who needs to stay beautiful after going through chaos. As a result, too much goes on in the climax to keep everyone active.Marvel's new freak of art does nothing valuable beside combine Greek mythology with visualized techno music, two things that should never go together. As a result, the world looks uglier than ever before, even for a comic book movie, from the stupid historical paintings decorating Asgard's capital building to Hela's overdesigned 'crown' or whatever you call it. People already care so little about ancient cultures, so once it's time for kids at school to learn about Greek history, they will think about something less valuable instead.Although I most want to talk about the acting, an overstated aspect that the entire Marvel series in actuality does dreadfully. Chris Hemsworth deserves no praise for his awful performance; he just stilts around with a charming smile plastered onto his spray-tanned face as if waiting for an awkward school photo. The film's comedic charisma has no thanks to give to him, an actor praised only because he's handsome without being annoying. But Jeff Goldblum was the absolute worst casting decision; his instantly forgettable role simply felt awkward to watch, as he created the most painful attempts at humor. I can't remember a time he has ever put on a good performance, and I wonder how he's still getting cast in big movies today.The nitpicks go on much further than you may assume: Teenage boys might complain about the fake looking graphics fit for the X-Box. Long time Marvel fans might complain about Doctor Strange's underuse in an easily rewritable four-minute scene. The more artsy viewers might complain about Hulk's dumb looking gladiator armor. The older viewers might complain about some of the seemingly never- ending jokes. Women might complain about how Hela insults middle-aged women everywhere who want representation beyond roadblocks to men's triumphs. And parents might complain about the bad role model Thor sets for younger boys. Thor's first scene alone features him playing with his hammer in its 3D glory as he beats up demons Halo style. Then for the rest of the film he joyfully beats up his siblings, celebrating his rewards afterward. So why let boys look up to some self-righteous white dude with flowing blonde hair who brags about the hardness of his hammer? If anything, Thor will raise a generation of pompous blonde-haired men who think only about claiming the throne.",2,22,39,3 November 2017
Moana," A Satisfying Magical Resurrection of A Long Lost Culture
","Faithful to the tradition of Disney's renaissance era, Moana takes audiences of all ages on a journey with a resourceful young woman who learns her place in the world. Parents will love the tribute toward Polynesian culture, while kids will love the fantastical journey made complete with a fresh color palette. Other than an inappropriately placed gag about urination, Moana has established itself as yet another family-friendly hit by the Disney studio within their CGI renaissance.The wide range of animation styles explored here starts with a two- dimensional storytelling of what Polynesian religion believes brought the islands into existence. In what appears to be a moving tapestry, a wise, grandmotherly voice-over tells us of Mother Island, who raised islands out of the sea and then rested among them. That is, until Maui the shapeshifting demigod stole her heart. Along his path away from Mother Island, he lost the heart, as well as his fish hook that allows him to shapeshift.Then the animation style switches to the traditional computer animation, where an elderly storyteller is speaking to her grandchildren about the story. The one seated in the middle of the pack, the heroine of our story, immediately goes out onto the seashore, where the miraculously animated living water leads her through conch shells to the heart of Mother Island itself: the ocean called her to restore peace to the land.Then this toddler grows up to become Moana, daughter of the chief who wishes to sway away from their traditional ways in order to explore the world. She's a typical kid's movie heroine we've seen countless times before, and her motive to defy authority is not a good message for our kids, but the empowering musical voice by Auli'i Cravalho plenty makes up for that.Her grandmother pushes her to follow the calling by the ocean to find Maui the demigod so that she can help him retrieve his fish hook and return the heart to Mother Island. It follows out of the tradition followed by her people, as they are not voyagers; but their long-forgotten ancestry says otherwise. Therefore, Moana goes out on the quest, with a google-eyed, dim-witted chicken as her sole companion.Then she meets Maui himself, voiced with a lovable laid-back nature by Dwayne Johnson. He adds the familiar heart and soul expected from any Disney feature, as his tattoos move individually to express his true feelings.Now with the demigod on her voyage, Moana travels elsewhere to find his hook and get to Mother Island. Such stops include an underwater world of fantasy that houses a giant gold-crazy hermit crab. He is not one of the more tolerable portions of the adventure though, as his modes of dialogue includes rambling without a clear punchline to whatever joke he's attempting to deliver, and an out of place song sung in the style of Paul McCartney.This is among one of the other songs that simply sound odd in melody. Even so, there are several hits in the score, including Moana's single ballad, 'How Far I'll Go,' and the catchy 'We Know the Way,' both of which are guaranteed Oscar nominations. Yet none of these songs will catch on as one of Disney's iconic tunes. In addition, anytime the characters are not singing, they are blatantly telling us through not-so-subtle foreshadowing what will happen later on.Another thing that is difficult to grasp about Moana is the big 'so what' of its celebration towards pagan religion. While yes, we should never be afraid to learn about other cultures and their backgrounds, depicting their gods as truth is not the answer to learning about who these people are. I would like for Disney to someday make a big leap in exploring and faithfully retelling the way those of another culture live their day to day lives, as to make up for their poor treatment of non-White races in the past.I cannot see Moana becoming a celebrated classic like Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or The Little Mermaid, nor can I see it largely influencing pop culture like Frozen or Zootopia, but it is still a fresh adventure for the young and young at heart to get the ideal expected Disney experience.",7,3,26,23 November 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Catches You in a Web of Mixed Errors
","Now back in Marvel's hands, fans are finally guaranteed to love Spider- Man again. Personally, I say Tobey Maguire still has the best cinematic version, with Spider-Man: Homecoming coming out on top over the Andrew Garfield version. The one we got now gives a brand spanking new take on the famous webslinger, one maybe a little too reliant on jokes for an emotionally satisfying experience. I admit it works in delivering another really funny movie by Marvel Studios, even though the other disliked clichés of the franchise are still here, including his ridiculous pose in front of the American flag. What possibly went wrong here? WellSeveral of the plot details may shut some viewers off. A blatant 'save the cat' scenario comes up early on, which may not sound too lame for anyone unfamiliar with what it means, until a coincidental plot twist and the most unromantic of marriage proposals dissatisfies any feel of logic. Besides Tony, nobody in the overly male cast has any personal ambition to exist other than to progress Peter's journey at the most unbelievably convenient times. So no need to include Spidey in any 'Screenwriting 101' courses.I cannot say that Stark's version of the patriot-colored costume tops all over versions; a couple of unnecessary gadgets, including a drone from his chest, drags it down too much to feel like the classic Spider- Man. His webbing also breaks too easily compared to Maguire's and Garfield's Spider-Men. While plenty of moments could have matched the intensity of Spider-Man 2's train rescue, it ultimately misses those opportunities. For instance, the ferry repair we all saw in the trailer ends too soon, aside from our hero forming a very on-the-nose crucifix pose.If anything, this movie works best from all its small, brief moments that connect to the rest of the MCU. To go into greater detail, it introduces our main hero with a hilarious video diary featuring Peter's perspective of the Civil War battle. Then he attempts to contact his mentor through a long chain of unanswered texts (again, very funny). These small moments all open up chances for the adorkable wall crawler to just have some fun, especially when he has to learn his web shooter settings. The rest of the cast outside of Tom Holland also puts in their A-game: Jacob Batalon, who plays Peter's best friend, times his jokes perfectly. Even Marisa Tomei understands her role beyond just being 'hot Aunt May,' and delivers moments when she genuinely tries to help her confused, secretive nephew. Overall, Spider-Man: Homecoming has now become the best acted, and most racially diverse, MCU movie to date.Yes, like New York City itself, the cast swims in a melting pot of color. Marvel very much strives for a new, inclusive version of the American arachnid, which is great, but the extra ethnicities contribute no storytelling purpose. Make Peter's Black love interest a Jew, and the plot remains unchanged. Turn the wimpy Indian bully Flash into the blonde-haired macho man he was intended to be, and again, nothing changes.In fact, I wish we got to see more of the high school setting than Peter's underused classmates. Rather than social media trends and fidget spinners, we instead watch genius kids solving problems better than the CIA. The 'Totally 80's' themed homecoming dance itself lasts only a few moments, and when we see it, it looks exactly opposite of the 1980's. Although the homecoming setting does turn briefly hilarious by incorporating the awkward homecoming photo session under dad's careful hawk's eye.Outside of the high school world, both New York and DC are key locations throughout the feature. The makeup and hairstyling job on the entire cast looks great in the different locations, but if you rewrote the script to take place in Malaysia, the story remains unaltered.Although Spider-Man: Homecoming did get one thing right about New York's culture: the rebellious nature of its teenagers. Even compared to the other Avengers, no parent would want to raise a selfish kid like Peter. Like his counterpart Deadpool, Spider-Man defaces public property, steals cars, hates authority, and lies to everyone so that he can have fun fighting bad guys. He treats criminals like they deserve just to be bullied around by some kid. His mentor, Iron Man, even gives him a great moral, saying, 'If you're nothing without the suit then you should not have it,' yet the ending contradicts his sensical message. Teens nowadays deserve better role models.So therefore, I personally prefer the whimpering Tobey Maguire over the kid with the hot aunt; yet I prefer the single antagonist he fights here, however badly designed he may be, over the excessive plastering of villains pitted against Garfield. So the overall perfect version of Spider-Man may never exist, but for what we got now, it'll do.",4,8,14,7 July 2017
Suicide Squad," A Chaotic Catastrophe, But Harley is Hot.
","We all know the history of Suicide Squad's production. Jared Leto (Dallas Buyers Club) went through meticulous preparation for his role as the Joker, including mailing a live rat to his on screen girlfriend, Margot Robbie (The Wolf of Wall Street). Women all over were cosplaying as Harley Quinn months before this film even was completed. A group of fans formed a petition to shut down RottenTomatoes after critics gave it a 35% rating only three days before its release. So now, it's time to ask: was it worth all the hullabaloo?Essentially, in this first ever villain ensemble picture, these imprisoned denizens of the law are temporarily released from their cells for a top secret mission. The government is already worried of another Superman coming to earth, so they have no other options besides rely on these metahumans to stop a typical extra-dimensional villain from creating yet another doomsday over the world. If they succeed, they get ten years off their prison sentence. If they fail, they die.The result is an edgier version of Guardians of the Galaxy, except without the fun, fascinating imagery, impressive CGI, or anything else that makes this stand out as its own entity. Like any other action movie these days, it resorts to constant close-up motion sickness in all the action scenes, overusing noisy colors and upbeat pop music to add flavor. The entire first forty minutes is a meticulous bore to manage through, as it overuses backstory exposition and flashback on every single character. And yes, I do mean every single one. Anyways, after this torturous, lengthy intro, the movie finally gets started with the villains gearing up for their mission under the supervision of the CIA. It's a pretty wild ride if you are an expert at keeping track of ten different subplots from one-dimensional characters fighting for the audience's attention.The team is not full of the biggest failures known to mankind, but they're not going to be remembered within an hour after the first meeting. From what I remembered, there was a masked Japanese warrior named Katana (Karen Fukuhara) whose husband is trapped in her sword. There was also an offensive Australian stereotype named Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) who exists for no reason besides comic relief. Then there was Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), who does next to nothing memorable besides being rolled in a restraining harness like Hannibal Lecter. Then there was the skeleton-tatted El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), who stands out with his surprisingly tragic backstory. Then there was the governmental supervisor of the squad (Viola Davis) who likes to control them as their god.The squad does have a couple of redeeming members who want something out of their mission. El Diablo is certainly one, but the rogue gunman Deadshot (Will Smith) makes one of the film's greater impressions. Now, it's not to say that Will Smith was any good in the role, because he honestly does exactly the same routine as all his 90's roles. Even his character's backstory feels clichéd to Smith's type of character. He has a daughter, you see, and she does not approve of his murderous lifestyle. She even puts her own life at risk to stop her father from killing anyone else. It feels pretty sweet, but haven't we seen this before?Now as for Jared Leto's highly anticipated performance as the Joker, I hate to break it to you: he let me down. With all we have heard about what he did to prepare for his role to make it his own, the crew barely gives him any useful material to work off of. The closest thing to disturbing he gets to is laughing like a pedophile inside a circle of knives.Everyone thought he would be the best part of the movie, but you know what was the best part? Not the Joker, but the Joker's lil' monster. Margot Robbie is both deliciously seductive and delightfully psychotic as Harley Quinn, balancing that behavior with a girly innocence to generate a believable romance with the clown prince of crime. She has the only flashbacks that I was okay with seeing, particularly one where she willfully jumps into a vat of chemicals for a twisted make-out session with her beau. Sure, she may have been a bit too sexualized for what her character called for, but I would have much preferred her to be the sole main character than to have five different leads.We've never seen anything quite like this movie, and I'm sure this will not be the last supervillain ensemble picture. I'm sure that the crimes that Suicide Squad has committed on storytelling will not remain in the public's memories, but I already presume a long and successful screen career for the fresh Margot Robbie.",4,0,1,5 August 2016
Doctor Strange," Sherlock is Back- With Witchcraft! And Superpowers!
","Meet neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange. He is as egocentric as any politician, yet as clever at his job as any detective. The well- acclaimed British actor Benedict Cumberbatch (The Imitation Game, Sherlock) takes the stage in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to depict one of the cleverest caped crusaders within the franchise. He is certainly a delight as always, but it's the unusual approach to Doctor Strange that may either paralyze you with amazement or scare you away.His life at this point is pretty normal: go to work, save a life, have a fight with his nagging coworker/girlfriend played by Academy Award nominee Rachel McAdams (Midnight in Paris, Spotlight), cherry pick the patients he wishes to save, and gloat about the spectacular perfection that is his life. That is, until an uncalled for car crash leaves his hands paralyzed with severe nerve damage.Which leads him to Nepal, where an Ancient One is said to be there with knowledge of spiritual healing. It's not in his comfort zone but hey? What has he got to lose?So he goes under spiritual training by a cult, receiving far more than he bargained for. Next thing he knows, he is dawned with the abilities to remove his spirit from his material body, create portals in midair, and fly with the powers of a levitating cape, and all in an effort to save the world from an outer demon.My biggest problem with this highly entertaining (and funny) addition to the MCU is its swaying away from the familiar gadgets and aliens of the previous films and more into an out-of-place exploration of man's relationship with the occult. It's not odd to say, especially considering that they do not do a very good job at portraying it.Normally, if there was a cult such as this one who depend on old spiritual tradition, why are they of all different races around the world? We have one White woman, one Black man, and one Asian, and several others who are from places I cannot possibly pinpoint. It may not matter to you, but this really hurts the film's believability.Although I do give director Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) credit for telling the story as if it were a real Buddhist or Hindu legend, while at the same time a part of our own modern culture. He does this best through the most obvious yet brilliantly executed way of combining the two: colorful trips through the spiritual universe that wows you off guard, especially when viewed behind 3-D glasses. While not in the infinite realms of the non-materialistic universe, Dr. Strange and his comrades fight against the assassins of time and space through showcases of city environments spinning and losing form within itself, as if you're watching Inception though a kaleidoscope.Older traditions of Hindu training are also exploited here in the same fashion done by The Matrix: Dr. Strange is thrown to the top of Mt. Everest to test how quickly he can form a portal back to base. It would generate shrieks of joy from all anime fans, but it later turns out to be a missed chance of character development, which leads into this film's biggest problemWith something as controversial and delicate as occult practices driving the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I doubt there could be a reasonable way to do something like this under Marvel's wing perfectly. I do appreciate the risks that they have been taking to be different with each of their films (just compare and contrast Guardians of the Galaxy with Captain America: Civil War for a minute). But frankly, some risks are not worth taking. It was worth it to create the mind- bending kaleidoscopic fight sequences, but when Marvel's name is attached, I do not believe that it would help with their branding.",Null,1,5,7 November 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," I Think it's Great!
","Much credit goes to Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Its analysis on a small town's skewed priorities on law and order feels inspired by the United States' many cultures, especially from the perspective of Mildred, played by Oscar winner Frances McDormand (Fargo). She never says a single kind word to anyone, but her true personality blooms once she routinely plants flowers in front of her blood-red billboards as if at the Vietnam memorial. Once there, she shares a melodic conversation with a deer beside the highway, keeping her human. The rest of Ebbing, Missouri also seems given up on America's growth, set instead to let desires run on dunking others beneath self-worth.Though be warned: the three steps to the feature's creation appears a tad too rushed. The pre-production process mentions the Catholic church of the town exactly once in the first act, missing out on its powerful potential to serve a stronger MacGuffin to the story beyond just its hindrance to society. The production process's cheap burn makeup effects look poor compared to the wounds put on Leonardo DiCaprio's bear wounds. The post-production process disrupts its own narrative flow by throwing a flashback into a moment when dialogue would have sufficed.Looking at the Oscar's past Best Picture winners, Spotlight and Moonlight, they both kept a consistent visual style, unlike Three Billboards. Primarily, the editor, Jon Gregory (Four Weddings and a Funeral, In Bruges) was a poor choice to put together the feature; a potential Oscar contender ought to require someone more experienced to present a population of human beings turned into thoughtless advertisements. Likewise, cinematographer Ben Davis (Guardians of the Galaxy) resorts to unnecessarily pointing the Steadicam upwards. If treated like a mockumentary similar to This Is Spinal Tap, then a greater impact could linger in this movie's legacy.Now with the problems out of the way, basically everything else in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri accomplishes its civic duty.Obviously, cops nowadays are no State Farm, so here their portrayal gets treated positively. Mildred's middle-class family home in particular takes no breather: her ex-husband continues to abuse her while her last shared memory with her murdered daughter reeks in high regret. Maybe the people here were born with it, maybe the pressure to advertise caused everyone to become whatever social message they always talk about. Its timelessness in leaving the precise year vague adds the extra snap, crackle, and pop to the core theme.My commemorations go to the finger lickin' good performances by the whole cast, every single one proves the power of an ensemble, particularly the underrated actor Caleb Landry Jones (Breaking Bad, Get Out). Yet Sam Rockwell in particular is after an Academy Award nomination, and understandably so: his performance turns agitated one minute and collapsing in silent tears the next.I appreciate how Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri knew not to excessively milk its timeliness right after it calls the cops a 'N*gger Torturing Business,' since they lack concentration on actual crimes. Although these cops prefer the equally undignified term 'Persons of Color;' even they the authorities think Black people fall short against 'normal' White people. This mouth-gaping social relevance soon turns ironic once a new Black police sheriff comes into town.Beyond the Blacks/Police conflict that challenges old stereotypes, jokes about people's weight and height keep going and going and going without crossing the line towards the offensive. The head of Ebbing's P.R. business even has the name Red, because everyone else around him sees red—both literally and figuratively!It's a greatly clever style of writing which helps you to think different in a harsh way. We all want and need to preach about what makes us pound our fist on the table, and as depicted here, our abuse of our First Amendment rights turns us into our branding, erasing the definition between our wants and our needs. It really boils down to: Where do you want to go today?",7,3,9,8 December 2017
Lion," We've Seen This Before. But Hey, it's for a Good Cause!
","Eighty-thousand children go missing each year in India. Saroo Brierley, author of the autobiography, 'A Long Way Home,' was one, and he tells about his incredible journey from India to Australia and back again. The result of the adapted indie drama, Lion, is a well-intended attempt which utilizes a 'been there, done that' approach to prove how the community can pitch in to help families across the globe.Sure enough, being a depressingly heartwarming weepie, Lion starts on a heartbreaking note. Saroo as an adorable little five-year-old oversleeps and loses his way in a dark train station, separated from his older brother. He hops onto a train and arrives at another station far away, and sees no options available other than to sleep on cardboard with other lost kids. The stay gets cut short though, as several kidnappers force him out. He then comes across new parts of India's culture he never knew existed beyond his mother's work as a rock-hauler. A hospitable Hindu couple helps Saroo out until he runs away out of desperation. Soon, with hopes of locating his parents, an orphanage takes him in, where beatings occur daily.Eye-swelling in these first moments are guaranteed while watching a vulnerable little tike lose his innocence before reaching his full development of memory cells. When also considering how everyone in India speaks in their native tongue with English subtitles, an extra step authenticates the true story. However I must admit: the boy cast as Saroo, Sunny Pawar, acts precisely how any young actor would in his first role. Nobody cheers him on because of his talent, but because of his cuteness.A kind Australian couple eventually adopts Saroo, with some English lessons included to help him with the transition. As investing as it all feels, the very next event is, '20 years later.' So did nothing interesting happen within twenty years? This sort of leap in time happens constantly throughout the picture, limiting the story possibilities and minimizing Saroo's motives of returning to India. So proof exists in why Lion would prefer to tug on your heartstrings over structuring the story to deserve the countless awards it campaigned so hard for.Speaking of awards, my complements go to the Academy Award nominated performances of Nicole Kidman (The Hours, Moulin Rouge!) and Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire). Both portrayals standout satisfactorily well, carrying the second half of the film to maintain the audiences' tears. Although I ought to complain about Kidman's distractingly obvious wig. Yes, I realize they needed to cast a talented actress, and yes, I understand she needs to look like the real-life counterpart, so why not cast someone whose natural hair looks like the real life counterpart? Or maybe dye Kidman's hair? Oh, right. They needed an already nominated actress to guarantee a nomination, and she has to still look pretty in her natural silky blonde hair for those expensive interviews and campaigns.Yet like any other Oscar-bait picture, the production crew still put in tremendous effort. Saroo's growth into manhood blooms to life through various scenic shots meant to highlight memories of home, such as moths illuminated by the sun, or the infinite route of a railroad track. Then as things turn more personal and distanced from youth, the camera pulls in closer to the human face. The minds and hearts of everyone involved were in the right place, even if Lion turns out no different in quality than the summer released indie crowd-pleaser.Clearly, Lion will fall out of the public's memory after the 2017 Oscars ceremony. But the #LionHeart campaign it started will last much longer. It exists to raise donations to benefit the 80,000 lost children in India, and worldwide. I encourage you to offer them a small donation; even just a little can travel a long ways to make a difference.",6,1,4,2 February 2017
The Lost City of Z," A Great Manly Trek That Could Use a Compass
","The Lost City of Z; the one place men way back when thought of only as an obscure concept. Uncharted territory will always exist in our world, so who holds the right to claim it? It turns out a whole extra layer of humanity exists in our home called Earth, and it was the achievements of soldier Percy Fawcett who helped us dig deeper. Based on the book by David Grann as well as factual truth, The Lost City of Z aligns remarkable close with real life to tell us about how our past can help us press onward. ​ Director James Gray (The Immigrant) retells history through the perspectives of whoever influenced the great man's journeys, including the British council, his three children, and his committed wife. The missus criticizes him for leaving home to explore new worlds, sharing no part of it with them. She wants him to think women have it harder than men, considering the pains of childbirth and house care. Yet she barely knows anything about the true unkind nature of South America's rainforest, a world ruled by snakes, bats, and starvation.Yes, every character expresses enough inner conflict to keep any man invested along with his wife and son. Although Gray's feature may just as well best suit male audiences, as the whole family side to the feature gets underused rather poorly; Mr. Fawcett's three kids hardly have anything to say, let alone any attention. While the oldest, played by Tom Holland (Captain America: Civil War, Lo impossible), delivers a strong treatment, his screen presence offers no justice. He does not give the worst performance ever, but you could still buy into him, unlike the insufferable child who plays the younger pre-teen version of himself.Away from all familiarity, Mr. Fawcett takes on the dangers of the outside world in Brazil's rainforest. His team goes on the search for a hidden civilization void of previous White folk visitation. They eventually find ancient pottery, only miles away from a native tribe, who quickly become allies. These non-English speakers contribute well to the story, except they receive too little dialogue to leave a true impression on anyone, including the protagonist.In fact, most of the time, these Red-skins are the arrow launching, bloodthirsty savages the British stereotype them as. Their weapon of choice cause unimaginable chaos for these sightseers, including entanglement underwater behind a cloud of blood. It sets all sort of energy upon the screen, guaranteeing an aggressive transportation into the environment, clearly the film's best moments.Then once the action screeches to a halt, we have the camera-work by cinematographer Darius Khondji (Evita, Se7en) to watch. In fully sincerity, he has created probably the worst efforts of his career—no contrast exists in the already dark and grainy image. He just makes everything green and sunny, even if it means blowing out details in the facial features. Thankfully however, the tremendous eyesore turns slightly merciful three-quarters of the way through the movie. Here, the genre briefly turns into a relatively unimpactful war drama, which still manages to deliver Saving Private Ryan-esque thrills to those testosterone senses.Numerous other traits uplift this average joe of a biopic, such as the believable period costumes and the breathtaking greenery, while others pull it back, such as a forgetful musical score and Robert Pattinson's acting (progress is being made though). Maybe things could have worked better if Bleecker Street aimed for a hard-R rating, as the Brazilians themselves features all sorts of related red flags: naked overweight women, cannibalism, to name a few. At least nothing appears excessive enough to make any teenagers squirm with immaturity.So now the question remains: 'should I bother sitting through a biopic that probably won't make it past 20 million in the box office?' The Lost City of Z may not be the riskiest motion picture ever made, but it offers precisely what worldwide audiences need while considering the ancestry of ourselves, and how the inadequateness of our self-knowledge points us towards a single reality: we all come from the same soil.",5,1,2,21 April 2017
Baby Driver," Our Insanity Just Cranked Up to Eleven!
","Texas, Las Vegas, Brussels, Sandy Hook, over 142 gun violence victims had no reason to go so soon, but it happened. With so many celebrations of violence killing it at the box office, why do we still wonder how these tragedies continue? Even for myself, the news coverage on a new shooting has become white noise to me, it no longer disturbs me in the appropriate manner. Many other young men love watching stylish massacres, yet supposedly join the public worry about gun violence. From my experience, you can learn a lot about someone based on their taste in movies, so Baby Driver's wide popularity says a lot about the level of care most young men have about gun violence.Sure enough, director and writer Edgar Wright (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Shaun of the Dead) attacks the law in his own fueled world void of any justifiable punishment.First, I want to cover the lack of setting: instead of letting relevant social problems indicate that it takes place in Atlanta Georgia, the stickers on the cop cars alone indicate that. Honestly, if the location was changed to anywhere else in the world, the story remains the same. Rather than a believable city with different people to learn more about, a role-playing clean slate lets you easily imagine yourself in Baby's position for the town you live in.Although Edgar Wright, as he's most famous for, still pulls it off with a modernized narrative style, this time popping in a fluent radio language. In the first scene, the main protagonist, known as Baby, rocks out to his music in a vibrant red car, his lips in sync to the lyrics, ready to drive some bank robbers away from their heist. The absence of real dialogue in the first two scenes puts you into Baby's 24/7 mentality—he never takes off his earbuds, as he uses the beats of his tunes to fill in the beats of his new criminal lifestyle. So sure enough, the audio style cuts past Baby's shades to meet him at eye level: the gun fires and windshield wipers match the music beats perfectly. To take you further into Baby's mental state, you watch him mix his own tunes together while ignoring sudden flashbacks about his rough childhood. He barely even speaks to anybody, as his roommate speaks only in American Sign Language. It keeps you wondering: What goes on between his ears? Here's where Debora comes in, the cute waitress he at last opens himself up to in many sweet, informative conversations about music.Film editors Jonathan Amos and Paul Machliss (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) use appropriate jump cuts alongside the exploitation of circle shapes packed with attitude to transition between scenes. Cinematographer Bill Pope (Clueless, The Matrix) keeps up the excitement with a single uninterrupted shot to show Baby's strut down the street, which later turns into spinning the camera around the actors throughout their heated conversations. Once the camera acrobatics take a breather for some spicy dialogue, Wright keeps his visual metaphors in mind, like Baby looking at his reflection in self- doubt.Then once the engine starts up again, each piece of stunt choreography hits you hard with its seamless special effects, turning into a wild third act revved high on octane. Edgar Wright really deserves better directing gigs under a greater studio, he's sure got the talent!However, the fantastic technical achievement pale in impact compared to its dreadful lack of redemption toward humanity. If you land outside the male millennial core audience, you may notice the negative stereotypes painted on every roadblock to Baby's freedom. Alongside the White male supremacy, any named Blacks are either a terrorist or a cripple, nothing positive; in the same way, Asians and Mexicans are seen solely as terrorists. To make it more typical, this screenplay fails the Bechdel Test, giving the sole two significant female roles to gorgeous women who never even make eye contact.Honestly, if you took away the stylish soundtrack and spicy editing, you got another hollow fantasy populated by shallow archetypes. Baby comes off here as a passive protagonist who expresses no personal fears about the gang members. The same goes to Debora, a submissive device thrown in to be a 'get the girl' motivator, and the crime boss, an average pokerfaced motivator for the hero to improve. All else in Baby Driver matches the same sensical nature of Fast & Furious; just the villains run out of bullets when the plot demands it.I'm sorry if this offends you, but Edgar Wright's artistic strides in musical masturbation could benefit greater once he learns about the consequences of his work to live on in history, otherwise, his fans probably won't live long enough for it to happen.",5,3,6,10 November 2017
Justice League," The Fight for Lies, Injustice, and the American Greed
","Now with Justice League uniting the dark Avengers, Warner Bros. attempts to unite the gods of man, the Amazons, the Atlanteans, the cybernetic world, electric currents (?) and the overseer of those gods, resulting in a joyless action sequence display.First off, the new team members sway too far from their source material: The Flash's superpower is supposed to be superspeed alone, no electrical currents included as depicted here. Aquaman never once talks to fish, his signature superpower, his only attention seekers going straight to his pecs. The method of bringing Superman back to life (not spoiling anything by the way) makes no sense. Plus, Batman's technology lacks the creativity of his previous versions.Although, the introductions are sure-fire crowd pleasers, especially Wonder Woman's opening fight to remove a bomb from a public building. The Flash gets a neat intro too as he doodles on an unsuspecting rude guy's face in a millisecond, and right before meeting his father in prison. Like the Flash, Cyborg's backstory also starts off empathetic as his father Cyrus cares little about his son's now monstrous state. Then once Superman comes back, he forgets his identity, leading to a heated entertaining battle against the newly united fivesome.Yet in the end, the memory of the experience lasts much shorter than Wonder Woman did. The midway directing replacement of Joss Whedon shows as rock music blares at the most inappropriate moments, similarly, Zack Snyder's initiation shows with the dreadful CGI that equals early 2000's graphics.The screen writing most hurts the cinematic universe as the subplots jump everywhere with no surprises aside from the appalling Captain Obvious dialogue. Superman never properly meets the men in the new league, one Hera might bristle over due to how Wonder Woman's status as the sole female voice is overlooked.In fact, what happened to the whole family concept? I mean, Batman and Superman both have parent issues, Wonder Woman has mommy issues, Flash and Cyborg both have daddy issues, so what about Aquaman's parental issues? His lack of attention consequently makes the walking fish man's story arc the most incomplete, since we don't see him again until a half hour after his introduction. To make the nitpicks more aggravating: Exposition repeats itself three times each until the final moments literally spoon-feed the message as if everything contained some deeper meaning. Honestly, the scriptwriting nitpick list tops the mass of Jupiter.I now wish this movie was entirely animated, mainly to cover up the dreadful acting. The cast clearly reads off cue cards half the time, the other half of the time they pause too often, supposedly struggling to remember their lines. Henry Cavill in particular continues his reputation as a horrible, terrible performer... why bring him back? Why? They even needed to CGI his moustache away—just further evidence that Superman should STAY dead.Justice League in general seems to worship the flesh more so than the spirit, as every actor, yes, EVERY ACTOR, looks gorgeous, even after a tread through Hades in the climax. After his resurrection, Superman's hair, skin, and six-pack still look flawless without a sign of decomposition. The same especially goes to the staging of Gal Gadot: she wears leather tight pants, her booty framed to fill up the screen. Heck, her skirt barely even covers her butt cheeks! Meanwhile, the Flash, the skinny Jewish boy, covers his entire body under a high-tech suit, and Cyborg must survive off machinery to replace his permanently damaged African American body, as if race and religion weren't body- shamed enough.I'm now mortified to call these guys 'superheroes,' as they do nothing besides thwart whomever blocks their path to pride. Bruce tries to tell Diana about how she brings out people's better selves, but with the physical violence she resorts to, she does the complete opposite. They're all teaching girls to publicly sexualize themselves, which could cause men to rape them. They're all teaching boys to overwork their muscles, which could cause them to fall into heart failure by steroids or exhaustion. I have no recollection of hearing the word 'hero' in this heap; so now comics avoid rescuing a cat from on top of a tree to celebrate an ideal fantasy where you can feel more powerful than God himself. At the same time, Justice League wants you to lower your submission to worship DC's nonexistent gods, who stand for anything but truth, justice, and the American way.",2,5,12,24 November 2017
Dunkirk," The Loudest, Harshest Time at the Beach This Summer
","Now I presume the modern-day art house/blockbuster wizard will at last earn his first Oscar nomination for directing his tenth feature film, Dunkirk. He deserves it, as he creates a true cinematic spectacle set around a subject made for a true 'guy's night in.' Unlike other WWII films focused on the inner journey, Nolan utilizes the IMAX screen's visual splendor to grasp the British soldiers' first-person perspective whilst treading through turmoil to get back home.For you longtime Nolanites, you should be pleased to hear that the Dark Knight director achieves what he promised us in his passion project: a well-researched claustrophobic thriller. Everything he has never been very good at in the past, such as expositional dialogue, is left out, while his true strengths, such as bending the rules, remain. He relies on action, rather than philosophical ramblings, to communicate his message. This project also demonstrates the best of his actor direction; the number of soldiers he directs unnerves you to watch as they line up at the beach and unanimously gaze upon the terror above. His finished product almost resembles real recolorized news footage.These somehow endless events unravel in three separate narratives, each overlapping over different lengths of time. One takes place on the mole over a week, one takes place on the sea over a day, and one takes place in the air over an hour. (Think: Magnolia with a smaller cast) Each subplot feels truthful in authenticity as they unravel in real time, the clock pressing upon each one. The stories appear disconnected, then soon merge together into a graceful singular conclusion.Each of these men, whether on the ground, on the sea, or in the air, are not meant to be understood on a personal level, particularly with the older soldiers. Nolan's intention is in fact less for you to connect with the fictionalized war heroes, and more to see how the cost to fight affected everyone involved. Despite whatever little we learn of these men caught in the anarchy, we still believe them as traumatized souls as we watch them gaze upon death at every corner, even in the dry, empty French town behind them.Aside from the lack of a memorable character study, you still see the soldiers support each other in the heat of their conflicts. Sadly though, a much present father-son relationship misses its open chance at adding some needed heart to give us a breather from the mayhem.For the intended effect, Nolan's heart-stopping experience must only be watched on the biggest screen out there, with the best quality speakers in the world. In the theater, the ear-splitting gunfire and jet engine hum rattles you from the inside all the way to beneath your seat. As for the visual elements, the impressive dogfights tumble sideways and upside down over the vast ocean. Then on the ground, the seafoam sprays onto your 3D glasses, disorienting your vision as the ship of soldiers loses buoyancy. Inside the interiors, the camera comes in uncomfortably close to the heated action, leaving no space left to squirm in your seat; it gives such a contrast against the massive exteriors, it makes you ponder each sequence's behind-the-scenes process.The intensity here would be wasted without the urgent music by the legendary Hans Zimmer. His score never stops ticking as the time for the bomb to go off gets nearer, which he achieves by stressing the stiff, harsh sounds of strings. You rarely realize the score's effective prowess, as you're too focused on the revulsion to notice. Heck, you could use Zimmer's new Oscar-worthy piece to motivate your study sessions!Yet like any great director, people will always find more critiques to press against Christopher Nolan's greatest success. He deserves the already voiced criticisms about the little representation toward anyone besides British men, and he deserves further criticism about lacking a distinct 'so what' to what is another WWII feature. But as a whole, Dunkirk stands as Christopher Nolan's most thoughtful film to date; it impacts you enough to further research and discuss that dreadful day. Understanding the tragedy of violence is precisely what today's generation needs to understand, and Nolan just put us back on the right path.",7,0,8,21 July 2017
Captain America: Civil War," It's More than Meets the Eye
","It's happened: our heroes have turned against one another. Just the image above proves what the Avengers have come to: turning on one another in a state of civil war over their limit to government control. No more fun and games—it's time to really challenge what they stand for.I'll admit that I don't care too much about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They're fun to sit through in a theater full of other excited fans, but nothing about them resonates too deeply. But now, Captain America: Civil War has become one of the better of the movies within the trope. It's packed with the excitement, twists, fun, and laughter that we all expect from Marvel at this point. While it isn't worth multiple viewings, it is worthwhile for the teens, as there's more under that shiny armor than what meets the eye.Based on the 2007 Civil War comic books, this third addition to Captain America's misadventures turns him into a criminal that the nation has lost its hope in. It's similar to Batman v. Superman, except done right. The Avengers now find themselves in a public media predicament after a mishap in a Lagos chemical heist ends with several people dying thanks to them. Now, the government decides to let the United Nations Panel instruct the super team. Looks like Captain America now has to clear his name not only with the politicians, but his own close friends and teammates.Minus Hulk and Thor, all the heroes you know and love are back in action: Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Mass Destruction, Hawkeye, Falcon, and Ant-Man, plus some new faces as well: the smoothly cunning Black Panther and your friendly neighborhood, Spider-Man. Now let me tell you, it's the webslinger's third reboot within a decade, and at last they got the character right! Within the first 10 seconds, you will instantly say to yourself, 'Yes! Tom Holland was born to be Peter Parker! And Spider-Man!' His backstory is also smartly left out. After all, we already know it as this point, right? The rest of the heroes also have their share of some great laughs, Vision in particular, and they always seem to have tons of fun with each other on set. But I have one complaint though: it's the same old shtick we've always seen. We've got a super talented cast that includes Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlet Johansson, and they're doing the same thing we've always seen them do. It's not them that's the problem, it's the two directors, brothers Anthony and Joe Russo. They just don't know how to stage actors while getting worthwhile performances. There are some cool decision that these two make in continuing the series, and some not so cool. With the action scenes, it's impossible to tell whether if they're awesome or pathetic.But first, the good stuff: a garbage truck breaks down the arch in front of a medical center, Johansson totally rocks in combat action, there's a tunnel chase, Captain America holds down an entire helicopter by himself, the Avengers fight one another in one of the best moments of the entire movie series, and one hero has a big surprise that I cannot mention out of fear of spoiling anything.Now, the bad stuff: It's hard to see the action because of the sped up footage and shaky camera (you know what I'm talking about), the editing is monstrous, characters who needed backstories didn't get one, the VFX looks fake a lot of the time, Black Panther appears out of nowhere and at an unbelievably convenient time, and there is too much talking that takes away the tension.So therefore, the action is neither awesome nor pathetic. It's awesomely pathetic. Or is that pathetically awesome? Nah, I'll go with the first option.What I love right now about the Marvel Cinematic Universe is how every hero has his own story to tell. What makes it better is how this series makes that concept work so well, almost like it's the narrative of television marrying the narrative of film! I also like how it points out the issue of heroes creating mass destruction and putting the people in danger, possibly out of reaction towards Man of Steel. Although I probably could've done with a shorter film and a clearer plot, it's neat to see how all the subplots come together in the end.It's always a ton of fun to anticipate and sit through these movies on a big screen with hundreds of other excited fans. But you know what else? We can learn a lot about ourselves from the Avengers. It's already clear that we're a divided nation when it comes to things like whether trans-gendered people should use public restrooms of their choosing. It's just incredible how Marvel can take these abstract conditions of our country and simplify them. The Marvel Cinematic Universe may not produce all around perfect films, but it knows how to get the youth of the country out of our state of civil war. ​ Overall Grade: C+",6,3,10,22 June 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Someone Obliviate Me!
","I'm not quite sure what to make of this newest cinematic expansion of the Wizarding World. In one part, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them feels like a kid's movie with its majestic use of magic. In another part, its marketing and rating suggests a teen movie. Yet at the same time, its 1920's setting and cast of adult characters suggests something that would appeal best to whomever grew up with the original Harry Potter adventures. Well one thing is for sure, this new adaptation by the immortal J.K. Rowling is not going to appeal to anybody in the long-run.If anything, Fantastic Beasts seems the most like an adventure for the teenage girl, as the very casting of Eddie Redmayne (The Danish Girl, The Theory of Everything) will satisfy their fantasies with his boyish charm, along with a half-baked romance between a down-on- his-luck baker and a zesty accountant. But even so, I doubt any high school cheerleaders would be screaming their heads off over a film focused on combining the roaring twenties with a children's imagination.Yet true to what the world of Harry Potter has always done, this historical setting is rich with culture. It turns out that unlike the United Kingdom, America has a different word for muggles; 'No- Mags,' and their relationships align much closer to the Salem witch trials than simple racism. The two worlds between the wizards and No-Mags' each look as captivating as they do true to the historical era, complete with a scandalous goblin singing at a bar.Then in comes skimpy old Newt Scamander, played by the same British actor I previously mentioned. He arrives in New York City on the Fort Elizabeth, with a secret mission involving his magical briefcase. Just step inside his case, and you will see an immense world inside: room upon room housing some of the most fascinating beasts you will find. These include leafy little bowtruckles, a money-mad niffler, a mischievous demiguise, and a size-shifting occamy. Kids will love seeing these imaginative designs, but what they're doing in a PG-13 movie I cannot say.Teens would certainly not care about seeing these beasts anyway, as the special effects used to bring them to life is distractingly awful. Remember in the Harry Potter movies when computer generated imagery was only used when necessary? Now here, it is use in practically every frame for every scenario, even in places where makeup prosthetics would have gotten the job done easy. Think the entire Hobbit trilogy, except without any effort by the visual effects team.These beasts have ended up under the hands of a No-Mag named Mr. Kowalski who has dreams of starting his own bakery. Yet he mistakenly lets the case open, and several of the beasts lose into the city. Now Newt has to bring him as a witness to protect his innocence from the National Astute of Secrecy, or else face serious criminal penalty for exposing the wizarding community to the No- Mags.There are points here and there that reveal how a great movie could have been made, but for the greater portion, the blank performances by the majority of the cast send a preposterous message that says the law and government should not control us. If you ask me, these negative, limiting depictions of political authorities is way too common in our movie theaters, and our leaders deserve better treatment. Even worse, this predictable story is ruined all the more by a plot twist that adds nothing; literally nothing to the story.Yet it doesn't stop there. After a snore-inducing climax, the final moments try to emotionally manipulate you as if the filmmakers felt that they earned it somehow—they didn't. Then they of course have to leave the final frame open for a sequel which I obviously will not be looking forward to.If you think that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a dream come true for your inner witch or wizard, I hate to break it to you: look elsewhere. This attempt at keeping the franchise alive and fresh is only making it age all the more, and its attempted relational bonds between America and England does not feel any stronger either. I could really use a great motion picture that makes us people feel united in spite of differences in a world that wants us to feel otherwise, and this does not accomplish that.",5,3,5,19 November 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," It's Just Too Much
","We still remember the pleasant cinematic surprise from Pirates of the Caribbean, which took us on a fun adventure fit for the young at heart. When the sequel came out, we started to grow a little sick of it. By the third, it had overstayed its welcome. By the fourth, crap, I keep forgetting that a fourth one exists! Anyway, now we're on fifth, where a few good qualities, to our amazement, remained consistent these past fourteen years. It still sustains the same atmosphere, like watching a product of the 2000's. Depp has still got it with his iconic performance, Geoffrey Rush still graces the screen, and best of all, Hans Zimmer's famous score sounds fresher than ever.Whew, got the good stuff out of the way. Now let us talk about the atrocities of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.Basically, the main hero has to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do to harness its power to control life and death. Oops, wrong movie. Well, just replace the ark with the trident of Poseidon, and the Nazis with a pirate ghost army, and the plot stays pretty much the same. Yeah, the youth of the previous decade were into ancient mythology, but now they moved on to obsessing over the future. Why not let a dated concept sit to collect shelf dust?The whole Indiana Jones rip-off of a plot may intrigue the parents after overcoming the opening prologue: A boy goes out rowing, ties his ankle to a rope, then tosses into the ocean a pile of rocks tied to the other end of the rope. It looks less like Will Turner's son going down to see him in the Flying Dutchman and more like Suicide 101. This honestly could have all landed on the cutting room floor; everything is retold anyway.The teens may feel rather dissatisfied too. No pretty imagery parades through to please their senses, particularly by the dull darkly lit stage combat. That also goes for the 'fun' action scenes shot in broad daylight, such as the first one, where a bunch of horses pull a house through the village streets. Then later, zombie sharks attack for three minutes' tops, a CGI-infested made-for-3D visual which looks like patty cake compared to what Zack Snyder can orchestrate.As for the kids, keep them far away. After all, the rating says PG-13. Inappropriate content gladly makes its way in for nothing besides a few cheap laughs, from the sexual (gawking at a woman's bare ankles) to the tasteless (offending every Spaniard in the world). However, the children are most likely to be traumatized by some of the imagery, including a basket of severed heads at the foot of a guillotine.Although the greater portion of audiences will groan over the production's excessive desperation to curse you with a giggle fit. At the screening I went to, the audience laughed plenty throughout, even I chuckled a few times. Yet the dialogue still lacks any point as the cast goes tirelessly in search for a punchline. For instance, one of the many pointless moments puts Jack Sparrow inside a whale skeleton to wed a boogery ogress of a woman.These tiresome jokes are blaring enough to make you believe the plot doesn't even exist, or that the jokes came from the mouths of human beings with fears and opinions. The characters keep contradicting their own desires; especially Jack Sparrow's Black Pearl crew, who right at the beginning abandons him for no reason, then later comes back for him for no reason. A predictable romantic subplot further bombards the key plot, as played between two actors with no chemistry; the female half of the equation, played by the unenthusiastic Kaya Scodelario (The Maze Runner) makes it worse by relying on the eyes on her chest other than the eyes on her face to stir up emotions. You could potentially forgive the writers for their lack of care in developing believable relationships, until the ending closes every story arc with pure hogwash.Oh, believe me, it gets worse. This motion picture also brings up the fact that Galileo Galilei actually built his telescope to search for the trident of Poseidon, as a map to its location is found within the stars. Apparently, all these historians overlooked that important detail. Well, considering this alternate reality features a ghost army who pass through matter yet still kill people with their swords, that historical 'fact' is the closest to believable Dead Men Tell No Tales gets.Okay, enough already. Did we seriously forget that Pirates of the Caribbean was once only a freaking animatronic show breathed on by Walt himself?",3,42,76,26 May 2017
Hidden Figures," What We Could Use to Keep Running Forward
","Fifty-six years ago, the first Black women came to work at NASA, a milestone during a time that in a way appears similar to our modern- day culture. Maybe there are no more Jim Crow segregation laws, but we still see Civil Rights protests by angry citizens flaunting picket signs, gender discrimination in the workforce, and consistent scientific breakthroughs from widely respected corporations. You might believe me when I say how very little has changed since then, as we are ultimately guilty of repeating the same mistakes, which the newest biopic, Hidden Figures, subtly proves to us. ​ It churns your stomach to remember the function of class relations in 1961: all colored people by law could only touch specially separated computers, bathrooms, and coffee stations labeled, 'colored.' The police also had the privilege to escort a Negro out of the library for setting foot in the 'White' section. Unbelievably, these rules to living were active not too long ago. Yet these circumstances allow the delivery of an uplifting true story about man's historical progression and future potential.Three ladies of color are seen beside a non-functioning car in the Virginia countryside. So who else would come to ruin their day other than a stubborn police officer? It looks like a deep pit of doom until they suddenly get the car functioning again, and successfully convince the officer to escort them to their jobs at NASA.One is sent to the other 'colored' workers in a separate room from the rest of the campus, one is left to work in the testing facility where the other men bully her, and one gets the worst of it—she spends day and night working behind a desk, ruthlessly mistreated by everybody else. Her incredible knowledge in analytical geometry makes little difference; she still gets deliberately discriminated by her coworkers, and has no other options other than to race half a mile across campus to the nearest 'colored' bathroom whenever she needs to relieve herself.The cast and crew's hard work results in a loyal adaptation, both to the true story and to the Margot Lee Shetterly book it's based on. Educational facilities everywhere will benefit from its survey of the cultural influence on NASA during its early efforts of launching man into space. If that's not a landmark event in societal progression worth telling, then I don't know what is.Although beside the meticulous recreation of the Civil Rights era's segregation, the overall period setting offers nothing new to the cinematic experience. Director Theodore Melfi's direction brims in the epitome of generic: creating too squeaky-clean of an atmosphere in order to be the sole 'family-friendly' Oscar buzz movie. The bright colors and made-for-television sets do not recreate the sickening feel of the era it attempts to establish. Although the period does get needed justice by showing a series of news footage from the time, the slightly-off-focus cinematography fails to craft the feel of immersion.The shifts in tone and character may feel a bit too sudden to produce any further realism in the environment, the overwhelmingly masculine society triggers a series of intriguing tests onto the three women. At home, one of them must act as both mommy and daddy to her three daughters, adding to her already boiling pressure. The challenges on and off the job never seem to quit, and the remarkable chemistry between the three leading ladies: Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe, halt any dull moments. Henson particularly deserves special recognition in her portrayal of an independent woman we want to succeed; her transparent discomfort comes across as all the White workers stop and stare at the color of her skin.While a picture about the Civil Rights era probably didn't need to dwindle its content down to a profitable PG-rating, the job still triumphs based on the difficult subject the cast and crew had to handle. In light of recent memories we have succumbed to throughout 2016, all of us: man and woman, dark or light, millennial and baby boomer, ought to use a high quality feel-good drama to look toward a brighter 2017.",7,2,7,27 January 2017
Coco," The Holiday Treat That We Have Been Dying to See!
","How do you feel after a relative passes on? Sad? Afraid? Regretful? Doubtful? Relieved? Maybe you'll remember your exact emotions after seeing Pixar's newest celebration of family.A young Mexican boy named Miguel lives with his mamá Luisa and papá Enrique, his little sister Socorro, his aunts Carmen and Gloria, his uncle Berto, his cousins Abel, Rosa, Benny and Manny, his grandparents Franco and Abuelita, and his great grandmother, Coco, together, they're the Rivera family. The ancestors remain dear to the Riveras' memories— well, except the father of Mamá Coco who left his family to pursue music. Today, all the Riveras, Grandma Abuelita in particular, took it to discipline anyone for touching an instrument.On the other side, a dense city houses Mexico's deceased souls alongside numerous other colorful spirit animals. When one of the inhabitants' photographs is set out by the live family members in the local cemetery on Día de los Muertos, a gate designed to resemble an immigration system gives them the okay to cross the amber leaf bridge to see their loved ones. Miguel knew them for years only through stories and photographs, and now he finally meets them in person after stealing a famous musician's guitar leaves him cursed. Miguel's ancestors include great-great grandmother Imelda, Mamá Coco's mother, the short Papá Julio, the plump Rosita, the horn-eyed Victoria, and the twins Felipe and Óscar; he must receive one of their blessings before sunrise, or else he will be stuck there forever.But Miguel thinks he found another way home through his musical idol, Ernesto De La Cruz, his great-great uncle from the story! He even has a way to find De La Cruz: Héctor, a silly little man desperate to see his family again since they never once set out his photo. Then once a Shyamalan twist reveals why he wants to see his family again so bad, the true heartache comes full circle.This production proves Pixar's continually committed research, including the steps outlined in the Día de los Muertos ceremony. Especially amongst the world of the incarnate, beautiful leaves create relaxed candlelight glows, like the long celebrated fun creativity shined by the immortal hopping lamp! I'm sure it keeps accurate to Mexico's family values, since audiences in Mexico were supposedly thrilled at the premiere, taking in $28 million since its October 27th release! The same level of effort goes to the voice actors: Anthony Gonzalez gives a true, soulful performance for Miguel, his musical voice as pure as child actors come, and the right cast surrounds him with further compassionate voices, whether dead or alive.Yet once Miguel enters the afterlife, coincidences lead him to wherever the narrative takes him. Similar to what the revolutionary animation studio continues failing at, the details of the world prioritize comedy over realism. For instance, the undead skeletons drink liquor, but at the same time, say they need no bathrooms. Some other elements appear to contradict the hard research, such as English being the primary language spoken in a Mexican location. Pixar long succeeded in its widely-loved shorts without dialogue, so couldn't they expand that format to a feature length? I mean, imagine if Coco was entirely in Spanish, except speech kept to a minimum? I think it would have made the experience a lot more authentic.Looking deeper into the script's issues, the title character, Mamá Coco, gets too little screen time to serve her plot importance justice; she just sits in her wheelchair, eyes half open, less prominent than her highest potential. The writers should have implemented the family theme further by giving each boy and girl (and dog) in the Rivera family a purpose.In full honesty, the script's issues stem from the protagonist, Miguel; he starts off whiny and selfish, in turn making his growth throughout less earned than its capacity. In fact, quite a few offensive moments seem tossed in for humor's sake, specifically a brief unnecessary scene where Miguel notices a nude portrait model (a skeleton). The depiction of Mexico's afterlife as truth rather than myth may also concern some more religious viewers. And finally, the gate used to allow Mexicans to pass through on Día de los Muertos almost parallels Trump's future vision of his wall, which could offend some more conservative viewers.Although Coco can overall still please anyone looking for a good holiday treat. These months are not always a happy time, considering the number of deaths around this time, so this special celebration of both life and death just might satisfy our hurt.",6,4,18,1 December 2017
Silence," A Cry Louder Than Anything Anyone Saw Coming
","I never thought I'd see the famous Martin Scorsese spend two decades working on a retelling of 17th century priests spreading Christianity in a country that forbade it, but by George he's done it! It still misses the intended level of perfection, but Silence reminds us of one important philosophy: We have no need to suffer while spreading the word of our beliefs, as God always speaks through silence.Scorsese grips us into the uncomfortable experience with the torture of several Christians, only a handful of thousands others facing the same fate. They are tied to crosses far away from their village, and the Japanese authorities slowly pour water directly from the hot springs onto their bare flesh. One of these Christian missionaries, portrayed by Liam Neeson (Michael Collins, Schindler's List), provides a voice-over that sounds like the mouth of God. Things may look hopeless from his perspective, but less than three hours later we learn of the Lord's consistent activity in their trials, despite His apparent silence.Two new American priests, depicted by Andrew Garfield (Hacksaw Ridge, The Social Network) and Adam Driver (Girls, Star Wars: The Force Awakens) set out on a life-or-death mission of ministry to the ruthless city of Nagasaki, Japan. Here, anyone committed to Christianity must hide in the wilderness, or else be forced by governmental rule to place their foot over a stone image of Christ against their will. Other forms of persecution includes burning at the stake and hanging on a cross over crashing waves, ensuring a slow and excruciating death. Despite the stunning, picturesque camera-work by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (Brokeback Mountain, The Wolf of Wall Street), the unholy conditions of this God-created land turns back onto his people. It makes you question: Where is God in moments of silence?The cast who recreates these events put on at best average performances, depending on how much creative juices director Scorsese pours into the particular scene. Yet top priority goes to the creative storytelling, even over the depth of the acting and characterizations. The two leads could not be more miscast, while nobody in the supporting cast has enough written detail to make you care for their predicament. For instance, one of the key characters gets killed after we don't see him for an hour, and then nobody ever mentions him again, almost as if he was never at any point necessary for the priests' mission. I'd also like to note a rather bizarre out-of-place moment when the priest played by Garfield looks into the water and sees his reflection as the painting of an apostle. He laughs at his distorted reflection as if he's had too much wine or something. It's a moment which you're not sure about how you're supposed to feel while watching, so you just cringe in an uncomfortable silence.The blaring errors aside, Mr. Scorsese's latest effort stands out from his others, as here there are no profound levels of cursing and violence, and no excessive love towards old filmmaking. In fact, he and his regular editor Thelma Schoonmaker (Goodfellas, Raging Bull) step back from his widely celebrated abrupt edit patterns, and instead keeps the pace as slow as possible to honor whomever suffered so much under God's supervision. No accompanying musical score to lend an ear to either—in fact, the sound mixing ranges from minimal to absent, depending on how much we can hear God speak through silence.Unlike others before it, this motion picture explores an unfamiliar place and time in history in an informative approach. It makes it easy to quickly parallel this account to the present-day worldwide desire to freely believe whatever without facing either hatred or persecution. If you were to watch these horrific trials placed on the faithful, a reminder should erupt within you of the everlasting hatred plaguing our world, yet another will erupt of hope for those evangelical souls not afraid to speak.",7,1,2,20 January 2017
Logan," The Old-Time Hero Retracts His Claws and Passes the Torch
","It is 2029, and mutations are still looked at as potential weapons for border patrol purposes. No longer are the mutants considered human, but tools. Although one is not yet a part of this fascist organization to redeem hope to America. He is the long-lasting hero who we have looked up to for over fifteen years, the one who we have experienced many highs and lows with, the one who Hugh Jackman is now making his adieu to, yes, he is Logan, or as some would know him, Wolverine.But it's not all fun and games anymore, with a crisp, well-earned R rating to match the red on dust violence this franchise needed. Director James Mangold (Kate & Leopold, Walk the Line) makes the most of Logan's legacy with the bloodiest action you'll see this spring. Especially with the backdrop upon the Mexican border, this gritty view of classic comic books feels more like a modern day western than a popcorn flick.Logan's first mode of action is taking down several immigrants attempting to steal one of his hubcaps. Then he receives a request from an unknown Mexican woman, demanding he escorts a little silent girl named Laura to North Dakota. His motivation for this is low, until three motivations erupt. One, he watches an upsetting video of mutant children in hospitals forcefully trained to become soldiers as if in a concentration camp. Two, she is one of these mutant children. Three, she is his daughter. So now with her on the road with him as well as Professor X, Logan learns his responsibility to punish those who neglect the gifts of these mutants.While the overall look of this journey looks nice, cinematographer John Mathieson (Gladiator) constantly sets up horrible lighting arrangements that make the backgrounds lighter than the subject's face. It becomes especially problematic, I might add, when he films the action scenes super up close, with nothing but a forgettable musical score to back it up. This is not the only thing that hurts the tension of the action scenes, but the aftereffects of the turmoil are weak, with no thanks to the unconvincing makeup effects. If you don't believe me, look at the albino man who serves as Logan and Professor X's personal assistant: The pale texture of his skin looks plastered on from at most ten minutes in the makeup chair.At least that's a minor complaint. Compare that to the stellar performances by Dafne Keen and Patrick Stewart, and this may just as well be the greatest achievement based off a Marvel comic. Stewart in particular steals the show with his aged, frail curtain call of a presence that just disorients your expectations further whenever he gets a seizure.With such a humble grandfather figure here to ground us into the foundation of this world, it's too bad that there's nothing else in the backdrop to give us a sense of Mexico's and Texas' true culture. The latest Academy Award nominee Hell or High Water delved quite a bit into this culture, but the closest that Logan gets to in creating the social pressures is a brief moment in a casino, and a villain with a really bad accent. Nothing else about the look of this world looks authentic enough to buy into.The other moral implications are also quite problematic. We all can understand that bloody adult-rated violence can lead to viewers imitating it in real life, but judging by the character of Logan as a father, he takes several actions that make me question whether he's worth looking up to as a role model. Shortly after he brings in his daughter to escort her, she robs from a convenience store (since she grew up in a hospital and thus doesn't know any better). While he does discipline her for attacking the clerk who tries to stop her, he robs from the store himself—and in a moment that is mostly played for laughs. Is this really the role model people should be looking up to?But then again, this type of gritty realism proves just how far superhero movies, and superheroes in general, have come since their rising popularity. All three of the protagonists: Logan, Laura, and Professor X, learn what it means to live in this wild frontier known as the United States, as represented by the professor's favorite motion picture, the classic western Shane.While he may not have always been the perfect sort of hero for us to look up to over the years, it has been a great pleasure having Logan around to entertain and teach us about what's really worth fighting for. So long, Wolverine. Thank you for your endeavors over the years, and thank you for leaving a strong legacy for the upcoming generation of mutants at heart.",5,5,13,3 March 2017
La La Land," Here's Looking at a Classic, Kid.
","It's shot in CinemaScope, it's big on pizazz, it's packed with bold color schemes, the stage lights appear straight out of a dream, it's big one minute and quiet the next, and every song and tune will replay in your head days after it's all over. No, you're not in the 1950s, and no, you're not in Kansas anymore. This is the present-day reality. So forget about those loud action movies with no respect for the stage, La La Land proves what can and should be done with the long lost art that is the moving picture.The joyful musical genre has been in the Hollywood cemetery for too long now, but even rarer now is a musical with entirely original music in an entirely original story, which director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) achieves with expert choreography. While he may give Southern California a bit too overly glamorous of a view with no dark edge, he still recaptures the same zest of West Side Story while cranking the spectacle up a notch. It's always a challenge for any serious director to stage a film where everyone breaks out into song without it oozing Disney Channel cheese, but Damien Chazelle has done it!Within Chazelle's cinematic recreation of Southern California, he fastens our seat belts through the bumpy relationship between two artists over the course of four long seasons, starting at the heat of Christmas. One is a ruby-red aspiring actress who cannot land an audition, and thus must serve coffee under a careless manager to make ends meet. The other is a Fred Astaire-Dooley Wilson mash-up whose fast fingers command jazz on the piano, no matter what his boss wants him to play. After they first meet over road rage at rush hour, these distracted minds find that destiny has forced them together with coincidental run-ins day after day. Everything after that is as pure and classic as dancing under a full moon.Once we learn about what these two have in common, boy is it the beginning of a beautiful friendship! He wants to revive Jazz as a modern art form, but she cannot stand listening to it, and this subject alone stems all the other conflicts that these two share over the course of a year. It is a pleasure to see the ups and downs of their romance, even if the other people in their lives are treated by the screenwriter as if they don't even matter.Yet it's not the supporting cast who helps us to understand their relationship, but the numbers that project their thoughts onto the moment. On their first formal meeting, she hears his piano playing as lit by a single spotlight, as if she's glancing into his own little world. On second formal meeting, they tap dance in front of a skyline at twilight. On the first date, they are swept off their feet—literally, to a dance against the stars in a planetarium. On the tenth date, they sing an Oscar-worthy duet. As time goes by, the dream of making it to the top of the world in Paris quickly diminishes. Her tears swell up along with the audiences'; I'll even admit I choked up as well, and I'm a man.This wide variety of tone in music is plentiful yet wisely spare, celebrating the history of cinema magic while wishing the best for its future. Yet also like the oldies it writes its love to, there are one too many white players in the production. There are two African Americans cast, but as dancers on the pier who say not a word, just as blacks were stereotyped in that golden age of Hollywood. If this production was less focused on making a musical spectacular and more focused on showing care and attention to today's media-frenzied audience, then there would have been a better likelihood for this to surpass those repetitive comic book movies at the box office.I sincerely hope for the day when people return to their senses and offer their money to movies because of their cinematic quality other than their branding. Considering how much music is now taking over our culture, we could use that reminder of how much music raises our self-esteem when times are hard. After seeing what La La Land can do with both old and new styles of filmmaking, I can absolutely assess that I love musicals all over again! Therefore, I encourage everyone to go see this magical delight to raise the spirits for 2017. After all, tomorrow is another day!",7,1,5,21 December 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Some Improvements Are Not Worth Making
","It's been a tale as old as time, a song as old as rhyme Beauty and the Beast. It was one of the animated instant classics to trigger the Disney Renaissance of the 1990s, defined an entire generation of Disney fans, set off some of the most iconic songs ever to grace the screen, was honored in several lists by the American Film Institute, was preserved in the National Film Registry the second year it was eligible (which is a huge deal), and was the first animated film in history to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. ​ So no pressure or anything in remaking it, right?Many of us were worried that this remake would just be a line-for- line remake of the original, but thankfully it's not. Several updates to the story are actually a strong improvement to fill in the problems with the original. The whole village's memory of the castle is erased by the enchantress, a contrast made much more blaring by a cursed eternal winter in the castle's borders even while summer goes on in the village.Belle's father Maurice also has a more complex subplot that actively engages both Gaston and LeFou, and he is motivated by his collection of homemade paintings and inventions used to memorialize his family legacy. This includes a backstory on Belle's mother, even if it adds virtually nothing to the plot.Other minor details are added to motivate Belle further, such as teaching a younger village girl to read, only to be condemned by others in the village. The parents will also enjoy this little detail: Gaston is a former war hero, which gives his musical number a whole new flavor. They also would find this new take on the Beast somewhat compelling: he doesn't even try to treat Belle decently as she first comes into the castle. He just keeps her in the prison, only to be moved into an appropriate bedroom without his consent or knowledge.There are plenty of other small plot holes from the original that are explained here, as the characters make it blatantly clear. What I mean is, it is done like this: one character asks a question we all asked about the original, then another character simply answers the question. Then the plot moves on as if nothing happened. So no high-class writing to be found here.Although when taking the whole sum of the product into consideration, the elements that remain the same compared to the original fall way, way short. The director of this live action adaptation, Bill Condon, who directed Dreamgirls and wrote the screenplay for Chicago, would presumably know all about how to do a musical properly. Although his skill is screaming to get out this time around, as nothing commands our sorrow for his reimagining of the beloved characters. With the exception of 'Be Our Guest,' none of the musical numbers or recreated scenes match the energy or creativity of its animated counterpart. I'm not just referring to the fact that most to everyone's singing voices are hard on the ears, but mainly to the fact that everything is rushed, especially the scene in the West Wing.If you think that you would feel charmed and nostalgic while watching this, sorry—not happening. Maybe it works as a plot expansion of a previously established story, but as a standalone you couldn't help but see the flaws. Belle even looks at the Beast more like she's scowling than like she's captivated by him. Then with Gaston, he doesn't feel like a jerk at all, as in his first meeting with Belle, he doesn't chuck her book into the mud- but actually hands her flowers! Flowers! From the guy we're supposed to hate! It's little details like this that will halt any true joy or tears. But what else would you expect when a remake is produced by a studio that cares more about social correctness than casting actual French actors for a film set in France?Speaking of which, you may all be wondering at this point, 'what about the exclusively gay moment with LeFou? Should I worry about it harming my kids?' Well, I can tell you this: You have absolutely nothing to worry about. It's a two second moment at the very end that is just as subtle as it is super easy to toss onto the cutting room floor. In fact, Josh Gad puts in just the right dose of humor and charm in his interpretation of LeFou, and he actually can sing pretty darn well! So you'll end up loving his character by the end, whether or not you agree with the homosexual lifestyle.Although if you ask me, this remake was never needed to be made. Yes, it did satisfy many of the problems that people have complained about for twenty-five years about the beloved animated classic, but it's not like this predictable fantasy is doing anything new or risky. If anything, it's just going to remind us of how much more moving and charming the original is, and we can sleep easy at night now knowing that some plot holes were filled without the animated film having to explain it for us.Let's just hope that the live action remake of Aladdin is not a total waste of everything.",4,34,72,17 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," I am Groot!
","Okay, just let me say really quick: I am absolutely obsessed with of Baby Groot! While he was amazing at the end of the first movie, now he has legs for rocking, defining him as the pop culture king for an entire generation!Now onto the rest of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which I should call absolutely freaking awesome! We all thought James Gunn outdid himself with the refreshing ball of excitement in a period full of blockbusters trying to be all edgy and stuff. Yet he outdid himself again with a funnier, sadder version of the original, guaranteeing howls of laughter from all ages. Yes, I said sadder, because the production crew did not shy away from an upsetting plot twist, only to segue into the quiet, touching final moments. U-huh, touching, as in, something unexpected happens that leaves a rather reflective note about all that you just saw.Gunn has made the most emotional feature to come out of Marvel Studios thus far, as well as the funniest by a mile. The jokes are bigger in saturation than Volume 1, setting off the most memorable opening credits sequence since Deadpool, thanks to everyone's favorite talking tree! He could have benefited if he were written to be more than just a comic sidekick, but whenever you laugh, perhaps half those moments will be because of him.Everyone else in the cast also delivers their fair share of belly-laugh moments, especially when Drax gets his own chance for romance with a bug-eyed mistress named Mantis, who can feel another's feelings with a touch. These two create the most moving romance, as well as the most quotable!Yet it exists not just for laughs, between their snappy arguments, the encompassing theme of family actively affects almost the whole cast in some way. It answers a question never consciously asked about Peter's backstory: where did his parents come from? In addition, Gamora and Nebula confront their open-ended sisterly conflict from before. However, the conclusion to Star-Lord's father's story feels rather dissatisfying, I mean, it is not dark or depressing, just not fully realized enough.To top it off, the laughs get a bit too consistent, giving no real time to breathe during some of the moments of drama; but it still managed to jump back on its feet and reconnect us back to the characters.Speaking of characters, the fivesome explore more territory of their galaxy in a very down-to-earth sort of approach. New places are seen such as a snow planet filled with robot hookers, a vivid planet built by man himself, remote-controlled battleships run by gold people, and the woods behind a Dairy Queen in 1980 Missouri, where an alien plant thrives. One minor complaint though; I can't quite buy into Star-Lord's space environment as a world that could inspire future storytellers, since everyone speaks English, unlike more carefully plotted out alien worlds including District 9 or Avatar.One last complaint: aside from all the old songs, the original soundtrack resembles the soundtracks of all other films under a similar genre these days. Although a flaw as minor as this one may not even be easily noticed; too many great qualities outnumber the bad ones. I also ought to highlight the phenomenal standout performances that display the best of Marvel Studios, particularly by Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, and Michael Rooker.What else can I say? Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 outdoes Marvel's branding, letting go of the offensive dehumanizing stereotypes from all the previous Cinematic Universe endeavors. This franchise appeals to more than just the youth market and their parents; anybody can have a blast! The older folk will love the nostalgic soundtrack as well as some surprise cameos by familiar faces; the teens will love the wild action balanced with some smart humor; the kids, if parents oblige to the PG-13 rating, will want to dance with Baby Groot; and everybody, no matter how young or how old, will love the timeless bonds about family.Can't wait for spidey to come out in July!",6,0,5,5 May 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Monstrous Epicness for the Ape Minded
","Were you disappointed by the amount of screen time by the giant lizard in Godzilla? I have good news for you: the big ape of Kong: Skull Island hits the screen immediately before the opening credits in all his grandness, and appears constantly throughout the film with constant action and explosions in the mix. Yet even without the ape on screen all the time, the amount of swords, flames, helicopters, bombs, and Skullcrushers satisfactorily draw out everything moment by moment in an approach comparative to various scenes in Apocalypse Now.So whether if you're a millennial or a baby boomer, the action should satisfy. Standard to the tradition of Skull Island, other behemoths are accompanied to confront both Kong and the humans in search for him. These camouflaged beasts include a swamp ox, a log insect, a giant spider amongst a bamboo forest, reptilian birds, and a kraken who becomes Kong's dinner. Other colorful sights on this god forsaken island range from the mesmerizing northern lights to the horrific pale-tinted mass grave of great ape skeletons, creating a believable look to a testing world against man's successes.Would such an experience keep you talking in the long run? Will you get pumped for Kong's eventual confrontation against Godzilla?Well, let's rewind the clock to answer that question, shall we?As the movie starts, a World War II soldier crash lands on a deserted island in 1944, only to come face to sword against a Japanese warrior. Compared to past King Kong movies, this slightly different period setting receives a rather poor treatment; I mean, when the first five minutes persuades us to cheer on a US soldier fighting against one of the Pearl Harbor bombers, has racism really changed at all by 2017 standards?Then the opening credits shows historical footage of man's scientific progress up until 1973. Then we see a researcher intent on proposing a government-funded trip to an unexplored destination named 'Skull Island,' the one island God did not finish creating. They compare it to the Bermuda Triangle, as nobody has ever come back alive. So right at the Vietnam War's end, a team of US soldiers, investigators, and a photographer set out to explore. Eventually they find the same soldier who crash landed in 1944, and introduce the old soldier to the worlds' robust change since he left humanity, and team up with him to head back home. Although could man really be king here? Especially when the castaway tribe worships a 200 foot tall ape?Kong may be an epic time for all you men out there, but you ladies may be napping once or twice, as your only mode of connection is Oscar winner Brie Larson (Room, Short Term 12), who exists here purely to play THAT kind of female lead. You know, the one who exists just so women have a celebrity name to gush over. The one who gets wet while wearing a skimpy gray tank top. If you're still not underwhelmed, what if I told you about her romantic subplot, one that meets absolutely no resolution?You may not even notice any predictable romantic subplot anyway, as there are so many millimeter thick cardboard cutout characters, none of which have a proper introduction to tell you who they are as human beings. Some of them are even there purely for comic relief's sake. The large cast's screen time balance of screen time has so little attention, you don't feel any hint of tension or sorrow whenever one of them gets killed or mauled.Now one question still remains: how will it be when Kong has to fight Godzilla in 2020? I can absolutely presume the fight will be epic. I mean, if Kong can deliver the nonstop action and cinematic grandness we asked for, while also learning its lessons from 2014's Godzilla, then it should turn out entertaining enough.On the other hand, if you prefer a much deeper story featuring characters who are worth cheering on, then you'd probably be better off watching Peter Jackson's version as opposed to investing in future films similar to Kong: Skull Island. It may not be a particularly good movie, nor was it trying to be, but it's still a pretty sweet thrill ride!",4,12,26,10 March 2017
Finding Dory," A Journey Over Waters Not to be Easily Forgotten
","To tell the truth, I was at first worried about how Finding Dory would turn out. I originally feared it would become nothing besides the writers taking advantage of nostalgic fan service to overuse the famous character's short-term memory loss solely for laughs. Worst of all, it would dumb her down into an offensive stereotype toward people who actually have her condition. But you know what? Finding Dory instead did the opposite, showing how tragic short-term memory loss can really be for a poor little fish.It all appropriately starts with Dory as a cute little tyke being taught by her parents how to explain her short-term memory loss to others. Then this touching opening turns immediately devastating as she wonders if she would ever forget her parents. Mom and pop simply affirm to her: follow the shells to find her way home. Then suddenly, she unexplainably appears in the middle of a dark kelp forest, separated from her parents. What happened to them? Where are they? How can she find her way home?It would be easy, except she doesn't remember.Now little Dory has nothing to do other than wander the ocean asking random fish where her mommy and daddy are. Yes, only five minutes in and it's already the second most devastating way to start a family movie (number one being Up). Eventually, she forgets what she's even searching for, left only to wander the ocean for the rest of her life, questioning her own existence. Here is where Marlin comes in. ​ One year later, she's living in a coral bed across Marlin and Nemo's anemone. Life seems just fine, until a freak accident causes her to remember something: her parents are in California! Thus, she talks Marlin and Nemo into going with her across the ocean to find her parents. Once a traumatizing giant squid attack follows after a trip through the EAC, Dory gets separated from her clown fish friends, ending up in the Marine Life Institute, quarantined and tagged for shipment to the Cleveland aquarium. Yet she'll stop at nothing to find her family! Picture Yes, it is unbelievably tragic to see how her short-term memory loss got her into such a bad place; it makes her character in Finding Nemo so much deeper, accomplishing exactly what any sequel should accomplish. But she thankfully has some friends to help her along the way.There's Hank the cranky octopus, whose slippery tentacle movements create some phenomenal visual gags with his camouflage ability. There's Destiny the ditsy whale shark, who can't stop running her head into things. There's Bailey the beluga whale, who adds some fantastic comedic material with his whale shark friend. There's Becky the silent loon, who pecks at anything that moves. There's Rudder and Fluke, the lazy sea lions who are relatively weak in spite of some definite hard-hitting laughs. There's the irresistibly cute otters who you just want to cuddle with. Then there's Dory's loving parents, who undeniably care for their little girl.Along with the memorable new characters and intense emotion, the world's setup also adds tremendous influence on Dory's journey of literal self-discovery. While it's not in the ocean, it's for the majority of the part in the amusement park reminiscing Sea World. The film's director Andrew Stanton has stated that Finding Dory features a new upgrade for their usual RenderMan system, allowing the animators to craft indirect light. Now let me tell you something: it pays off— each individual location has its own set of colors and textures to brim its own unique feel, making you feel like you're there. It's incredible to see how the barnacles and kelp decorate the environment, as well as how the soft, vivid memories of Dory are rendered as they come back to her. The aquarium's brilliant blue fish tank looks the most visually satisfying of all the set pieces, all even more of an immersive delight in 3D. It almost seems like computer animation exists specifically for underwater animation.In the end, the stunning animation adds so much power into Dory's discovery of her past. It's all a matter of asking, 'What would Dory do?' I felt surprisingly empowered while seeing a seemingly hopeless fish like Dory resolved a major issue independently by learning the way around her disability. Contrary to my thoughts coming into the theater, the mentally disabled can learn quite a bit from Finding Dory.Whether if you have Alzheimer's, dementia, down syndrome, autism, Asperger's, or even are a bit short on remembering things, keep in mind one philosophy for you to live by: whatever seems to hold you back from everyone else will never hold you back from yourself. If Dory can ignore her mental situation to make it all the way to a Californian aquarium, then you can do similar. If Dory can remember little things by seeing related items, you too can do similar. Dory has her own unique way of remembering things which works toward her survival. As for you, you too have that one unique thing to help you to overcome your one unique obstacle. Therefore, I recommend Finding Dory to family, kids, teens, everyone.You've already heard this said many times before but here it is: Pixar, you've done it again!Overall Grade: B+",8,4,13,22 June 2016
Arrival," Flips You Sideways in Knowing What Lies Beyond Us
","Immediately we are grabbed from our seats into the journey of Dr. Louise Banks and her discovery of what it means to be bound by time. Played vulnerably by five-time Oscar nominee Amy Adams (American Hustle, Doubt), Dr. Banks is weighed down in life by the loss of her daughter to cancer. While a sixth nomination for Adams is unlikely for this role, Arrival still gives a richly tense and starkly imaginative allegory to the coming end times, as paralleled by the inner demons of past trauma.In her present state, she is a college professor of English. At one of her teaching sessions, the lecture hall is suspiciously low on students. There are alerts on their mobile devices about unidentified objects landing across the globe, each one shaped like a large perpendicular shell. This causes for mass evacuation away from these objects, with only authorized authorities supervising and investigating what they are and where they come from. At this point, it feels like a rip-off of classic alien invasion thrillers including Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Day the Earth Stood Still. While it certainly obeys the tropes for the most part, creative liberties are still taken to ensure an exhilarating experience.Why did they land in these specific spots? That's the question the American government is trying to answer as they conduct an organized approach to interacting to whatever thrives inside these things. Their solution in interacting with this unknown is to bring in Dr. Banks to apply her English knowledge, a highly discomforting task for her, as well as the audience. The unpredictability and danger that she is thrown into hits you right where you feel, especially when it comes time to approach the inside of this vessel.Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Sicario) proves yet again how much skill he has in disorienting you without having to manipulate the screen with IMAX magic, as his choices of framing gives an overwhelming feel of scale in comparison to this unidentified object. The color palette used by cinematographer Bradford Young (A Most Violent Year) gives a stark feel of loneliness in a world separated by language barriers. The stressful sound effects complement the sad melodic music scored by Jóhann Jóhannsson (Sicario, The Theory of Everything).Inside of the object, the gravity is perpendicular to our own; then at the end of the object, these eerie, faceless, squid-like lifeforms behind a white veil await the approach of human investigators. Dr. Banks leads the interaction with these beings, later named 'Heptapods,' who communicate through painting abstract black rings that make up their language. So she, as a college professor, applies her history in English to vigorously study their language, which they call 'nonlinear orthography.' The process in figuring out their form of communication is absolutely brilliant and inspirational in how it's created and discovered.As real as this small-scale epic feels, its treatment towards the other countries is still rather problematic. Essentially, they are treated like outsiders from America whose first resort is to rage war against the unknown, unlike those in the richest country in the world who rely on communication past language barriers to solve problems. Based on what I've seen in the news recently, this is not how things have played out.There's also an issue I have with the portrayal of Dr. Banks' daughter, who is absent for a large portion of the film as if she's not really that important to the story. If she were mentioned more consistently through the first and second acts, she would have strengthened the conflict between the key characters.Yet the reminder of our relation with family issues and the passage of time may just as well be the push forward that we need to communicate with one another despite the inconvenience of language differences across barriers. It is through interaction and compromise that we will arrive at where we intend to go.",8,6,15,11 November 2016
Wonder Woman," All Sexes are Equal, But Some More So Than Others
","Attention girls, women, and Hillary supporters, you finally get your chance to enjoy the most popular movie genre as we step into summer. We already know the usual men's enjoyment concept from the comic book movie, where Batman fights Superman, or Captain America fights Iron Man, or Harley Quinn flaunts a sparkling tight thong. Now, a female superhero stars in her own female-directed movie, in armor built to expose her arms, legs, face, and shoulders!Does Wonder Woman automatically pass as certified fresh? Is it considered sexist to criticize a movie by a female director? No, and no.The first few moments progress with the velocity of a tuckered-out tortoise. It begins with our hero, Diana, remembering her childhood, when she felt inspired to fight for her fellow female warriors on their Zeus-created island. This repetitious, slow prologue only establishes facts that later get repeated.Things still start off rather slow in the first act, but women may love the immediate role reversal to give them well overdue credit. Right away Diana rescues a man from drowning, following a fight between the united Amazon women and a technologically advanced German army. These battles look less like the usual fan service kind of write-in, and more a choreographed ballet of steel mesh fit for the most committed of DC followers. The male viewers will offer praise as well, such as key scenes which tribute all the classics of guy's-night-in cinema, and a direct connection to Wayne Enterprises.The DC Universe could finally find its footing, yet improvement advances just by a hair compared to the loathed predecessors of the cinematic universe. The more forgetful characters here contribute nothing important, both in writing and direction, making the world around them equally shallow in cinematic exploration. The most accurate Greek mythology fact stated here is the women's birth origins from clay. Oh, and the island somehow coexists with the rest of the world, only accessible by a portal. It seems DC's cinematic universe cannot decide on its own reality.However, both the theme and artistry picks up from here. As the pilot/spy takes her from her home into civilization, he teaches her about his way of living as she arrives in London. The detail of her unfamiliarity parallels any immigrant arriving in a new home. As Diana takes on the city, fine dresses interfere with her ability to fight. She refuses to accept society's standards of being a lady, nor does she tolerate their form of government. From her experience, good generals fight amongst their other soldiers rather than sit in offices. She cleaves against her sword and shield, and sees the contradicting wide lacy indigo dresses as a straightjacket to her destiny. So, we can conclude one applicable takeaway: women empowerment means showing lots of skin. Does that also give women the right to sexualize their wardrobe along with practicing brute strength? Celebrating sexual freedom should never be a sign of fighting for others.Outside of the Israeli-Aztec heroine, the characters either hit or miss your memory as they come. Her spy/boyfriend works alongside a trio of soldiers who each voice strong opinions about bringing a woman on the battlefield with them. The first, a Moroccan, adds needed male flavor with his zesty interaction with the female hero. The other contributes sympathy as he generates a needed soul on the piano. The third, named 'Chief,' gives a great backstory to America for Diana's understanding. Outside of the heroes, a great female villain, addressed as Dr. Poison, compels your curiosity of her backstory thanks to her hazy performance behind a secretive phantom mask. So what went wrong here? Their accents resemble two days' worth of dialect classes rather than someone who breathes the culture. If these American films continue to misrepresent other cultures, why bother attempting to please an international audience? After all, no one can buy into a Greek island of Amazon woman descended from Israel, Britain, and Africa.By the time the third act rolls into play, the drama declines as you come to realize how little puts Diana in a real mode of conflict. The surround sound sure enough shakes your seat, but the male villain she confronts belongs in Marvel's long index of forgetful final bosses.Should this define 21st century feminism? Should we celebrate making women feel empowered by blaming their problems on men? Wonder Woman focuses on painting women as the only true saints in the world, whilst all the men cause the world's problems. Ever heard of Aileen Wuornos? Whose biopic starring Charlize Theron was also directed by Patty Jenkins? Was she not responsible for all sorts of problems? Men are not the sole blame for chaos, pride is; which everyone who has ever lived and ever will live falls short of.",4,18,48,2 June 2017
Mother!," Freaky Stressful Questions That May Not Be Answered
","A young woman's eyes stare at us from what appears to be hell, then the image of a man (Javier Bardem) pulls a fire veined crystal out of his burnt home, restoring it back to normal. The restoration brings his wife (Jennifer Lawrence) out of bed, in search for her husband amongst the empty rooms.Mother! focuses in on a famous writer who locks himself in his writer's den while his overworked wife repairs the entire house on her own. We see here a presumably distanced, unhealthy marriage, one that by the end should hopefully trigger some good conversation about proper healthy gender roles in a marriage.The wife's wardrobe acutely projects her precise emotional state throughout Darren Aronofsky's (Black Swan) film; she first wears a opaque see-through night gown, then dresses in either all frail- white or all wooly-gray, depending on her inner security. These costumes designed by Danny Glicker (Milk, Up in the Air) contrast her against these satanic visions she has from inside the supposedly inanimate house, as if it knows her true feelings better than she does. Sure enough, we travel deep into her psychological state mostly through close-ups on her unstable face. Nothing about her thoughts is left to the imagination once her husband starts letting these strangers stay in their place.The octagon-shaped home itself almost seems like a character itself, as it resides far away from civilization in a grain field. The wife never once sets foot out of the boarded wood, almost as if she and he house are one in the same.Somehow, more and more visitors come to the house's evil workings. First, a dying man to wants to visit the author who lives there, then his slutty lover moves in too, then their sons start a Cain- and- Abel fight, leaving the wife alone with a pool of blood to mop up. Everything from here violates her space as house fights, raves, demolishment, robberies, and even the SWAT team turn her house into a warzone. They came just to worship her author husband, attention he simply adores despite the deadly chaos. The noise levels become so loud you can barely hear her screams as her petite, silver dress gets gradually distressed. You truly feel sorrow for her while everything over a single evening grows worse to near-cultic levels; none of these terroristic visitors even once acknowledge her as anything more than property.This entire sequence is both the film's greatest asset and greatest blow, as it expresses its true distance from reality. These terrorists lack believability as they demolish the home; their behavior could possibly stem from the house's evil energy, but little was established to authenticate my theory.The feature's very last frame leaves the viewer with a reality twist that leaves behind more questions than answers as to everything seen. When I say questions, I mean the kind that leaves you less thinking about the ultimate theme, and more about the 'masterful' work of the director.Other classic horror films depicted evil spirits with 'open to fan theory' moments, while also keeping grounded in reality. Ironic, as various plot points here virtually copy both Rosemary's Baby and The Shining, both of which remained subtle in their interpretive imagery, which Mother! abuses.What made the message even less effective came from the acting, mainly by Miss Lawrence. She was supposed to appear compassionate compared to everyone else around her, except the Oscar winning actress did nothing with her eyes to evoke sympathy. She even unintentionally cracked me up pretty hard from her blank line deliveries and ear-screeching screams, especially when under really bad burnt makeup effects. I'm serious, any other a-list, b-list, or even c-list actress could have played her part better.I guess I can understand why she put so little care into her role, as it was written with too much passivity to bring out the independent woman empowerment it clearly intended. It never clarified what exactly she fears; is it the house itself, the strangers, or her husband? While we're at it, what does she even see in her husband if he disrespects her so often? Even if she fears aloneness, such weakness in character consequently ruins her sympathetic appeal.It makes you wonder: what if the gender roles swapped? What if the wife played the ungrateful workaholic while her husband did the cleaning? What if the women were played by unattractive actresses by talented unknowns possibly from a different ethnicity? Aronofsky may have addressed the wrong questions, yet with what he does expose us to, it helps to initiate some talking and listening for once.",5,3,10,15 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Unworthy of Your Worship
","Does the world really need Superman? Why would the world feel a need for Batman?I will have to say for myself that I am in no support for the blessed Man of Steel. I see little appeal in his uninspired character and ability, and he has played a small role in my years growing up. As for the Dark Knight, he led a much greater influence on my childhood, as he showed great persistence and strategic planning to maintain social order. Does Zack Snyder's new interpretation do justice to developing the images of either of these idols of citizen worship? In truth, Mr. Snyder has zero sense of what to communicate about our matters of worship in a single deity, no matter how intentional his attempts.It's unbelievable how little he hides Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice's symbolic ties with the Holy Scriptures. He starts it up with a dramatically overdone opening of Bruce Wayne as a child fleeing from his parents' funeral while flashing back to their deaths. He falls into a pit in a forest where hundreds of bats either carry him out or help him to float out, a scene I'm guessing is meant to be open to interpretation. The very next event we see of Bruce's life is ironically where Man of Steel had ended: right in the battle between Superman and General Zod. It takes you through Bruce's perspective of the destruction, and how he rescues a little girl whose mother was just killed in the mayhem. It's a savior figure of September 11th proportions, but the screenwriters Chris Terrio (Argo) and David S. Goyer (The Dark Knight) had no sense of structure to plot Bruce's growth into Batman emotionally right.Then Lois Lane goes to Africa to track a crime organization, a racially insensitive and unnecessary subplot if anything. Then Lex Luthor investigates the remains of Krypton through explorations in the Indian Ocean, in order to gain world domination as the devil overthrowing Metropolis' god. Then Clark Kent looks upon Metropolis' criticism toward him, all questioning if he deserves the honor as he has let several people die. I will admit, their responses are shockingly realistic to how the world would react to a Superman, but when aligned with the film's three other subplots, this philosophy lacks its intended purpose.Although an excellent dose of reality is added by the various people who come out to declare against the Man of Steel's actions towards humanity. You will see a legless man working under Bruce Wayne who defaces the Superman statue. You will see Neil DeGrasse Tyson speak on CNN about the hero's controversial actions. The people had looked up to Superman as their god, and they felt let down. So who other than Lex would come to force god to bow to him?Batman has also failed as a messiah for the people, yet in a different level of failure as he never even earns your respect and empathy to begin with. He always burns his bat emblem to the criminals he stops, and shoots soldiers dead in the broad daylight of Africa like some killer. Definitely not the Batman we've come to hope for. But eventually, he and Superman had to meet through Lex Luthor's dinner party, forming a connection as they were both assumedly responsible for the deaths of their families. Then Lex tests Superman's godliness by forcing him to kill the Batman in order to save the life of his mother. This battle between god and man sounds promising as you've just read in the film's title, yet the promised battle composes of the same blasting through walls and heavy punches that was mindlessly tossed around in Man of Steel, except now with no Ihop to complete the consumerist picture.Eventually, you just have to ask, when will Wonder Woman come in already?!It may not all be director Zack Snyder's fault for creating a jumbled mess of a social message, another part goes to the superfluous 3D cinematography by Larry Fong (300, Watchmen) that overuses its high contrast, underexposed low-key lighting, and painfully bright flames. But the greatest blame of the tremendous lack of passion belongs to the atrocious miscasting. Ben Affleck is a sheer bore as Batman, backed with no motivation nor grief. Jesse Eisenberg is the last one I would want to play the nemesis who seeks world domination. He looks more threatened than threatening with his amateurish, high pitched speech of a college know-it-all who's trying to act like a jock. There's also several random uncomfortable moments of actors Henry Cavill and Amy Adams appearing semi-nude on screen for the sake of it, but it's ultimately Mr. Eisenberg who will make you feel most embarrassed.Just take a look at our religiously unstable time, and you'll see how we're all susceptible to worshiping whatever god fills our immediate need, be it an iPhone or a significant other or a political figure, none of which saves us from when all hell breaks loose. I fail to see how Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice helps us to flee from those unfulfilling gods, nor deliver us to the greater saving power. I don't see any hope either that the future Justice League or Wonder Woman movies will continue what Zack Snyder is supposedly starting. Mr. Snyder, I hope you are reading this right now, because it's time you listened good: I understand your proper motives to attempt a message of belief in a false deity through these famous figures of American culture, but you also ought to listen to what the people of your Metropolis are saying about Batman and Superman's lack of heroism. They're in the proper mind. It's time you listened to the people.Overall Grade: D-",3,6,12,22 June 2016
Life," A Space Odyssey That Won't Live Long or Prosper
","Are we alone in the universe? Does life exist outside our world? Countless movies have provided answers, and yet we still don't know if intelligent beings inhabit other planets. So now following the generations-long trend, Daniel Espinosa plays his cards. While it may not be as rooted in scientific fact as District 9, Life still forces you to hold your breath out in the inky blackness of space as a single-cell organism grows into a faceless terror with only one instinct: kill.A Mars Mission of eight astronauts picks up sediment from the red planet, leading to discovery of an unidentified single-celled object —an official confirmation of life in space. This little guy is named 'Calvin,' after the elementary school of a select collection of children who sent in televised questions from Times Square. It isn't long though until Calvin grows appendages and breaks loose from his chamber. It probably wouldn't be too much to worry about, except his survival depends on the blood of each passenger on board. It's a long eight month return mission to Earth, so imagine what could happen if they don't eradicate Calvin before their time runs out!As the journey sets off, it feels rather promising with a single uninterrupted shot composing the first five minutes, much like what Gravity did on a much larger scale, but everything afterward turns into standard this, standard that. Christopher Nolan took advantage of it in Interstellar, unlike Espinosa who put so little imagination within the empty vastness of space that no emotionally isolating feel comes out of the empty end product. He even feels the need to throw us into Calvin's point of view at random instances, which makes me question all the more who I'm supposed to be rooting for. Not even Independence Day was foolish enough to change perspectives, so why would it work here?In fact, you could easily mistake Life for any other movie under the same genre. Many shots mimic set pieces and plot devices from something like Alien with no real originality. While you're not watching in fear of the gruesome Martian attacks, you're thinking, 'Hmm, where did I see that before? Oh, I remember! It's just like' In fact, it becomes so obvious, one character even makes a reference to Reanimator. You know the movie has given up on being original when even the one- dimensional plot devices talk about how clichéd it is.These talented actors cast as the astronauts certainly look the part, even if they barely have any direction to play from. Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain, Donnie Darko) gives the most believable performance of the entire cast, which honestly does not say very much. The entire crew consists of a Japanese man, a Black man, a Canadian man, and a bunch of White people with no established ethnic background. The depictions of everyone on board comes off more shallow than racially insensitive, although their accents are blaringly unconvincing. So the alien is not the one destroying our progress as a civilization, but the priority of White Americans over everyone else. Yes, I know: the title for their ship, 'International Space Station,' is used quite loosely.Then they express such stupidly pathetic means of interaction, with laughable on-the-nose exchanges about love, death, and living on Earth. The dialogue written by screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (Deadpool, Zombieland) repeatedly mentions so much of what we can already see, it honestly made me hope Calvin wins in the end. After all, this faceless probe feels more human than any of those cardboard cutouts made of flesh.Hey, at least it delivers the suspense it promised us. Especially the plot twist at the very end. It's not something as cleverly executed or shocking as Planet of the Apes, just a nice slice of dread to all the Gen-X men watching who want a satisfactory recreation of their childhood favorites.If anything, Life has become less of a tribute to those better sci- fi thrillers, and more of a reminder of how much more fun they are to watch. In fact, you'd be better off watching any one of those classics, as they tell us so much more about the dangers of the universe and its hindrance of mankind.",4,3,9,24 March 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," My Favorite Superhero, No Webslinging Necessary
","This is what Spider-Man should have been all this time. Here is what Ben Affleck should have done with Batman. Here is a true hero that outshines anyone wearing a colorful, shiny million dollar suit. In fact, all he has to suit him up and protect him from death is the holy word of God. He won't even dream of laying either an eye or a finger on a rifle. If today's superheroes can't help us through gun control, then this real-life hero of Hacksaw Ridge can.Just the first opening sequence alone is enough to tear your heart open and make a home there. Images of the battle on Hacksaw Ridge show the brutality of the historical event: there are more corpses than living souls, rats have arrived to feast off the remains, blowtorches incinerate whoever is left alive, and the heavy-handed music reminds you of what each soldier had to leave to fight for the important things.The story kicks off in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, where one boy goes too far in a fist-fight with his brother, nearly killing him with a brick to the forehead. Reminded of the antiviolence account of Cain and Abel, Desmond Doss feels immediate remorse for what he committed against his brother, and vows never to get involved with violence again.At a much older age, Desmond finds love with a local nurse who has seen soldiers return from World War II. Their romance from here is as sweet and believable as any man would remember his first relationship, complete with a blue jay feather to represent the delicacy of their love. It seems here like director Mel Gibson is returning to his old bags of tricks with the romantic plot of Braveheart, but the vulnerable Church-boy accent by main actor Andrew Garfield wins over both men and women.These small personal touches set up exactly why we should care about the tragic events that happen later, proving exactly what Gibson most succeeds at as a director. He's not even afraid to put in some comic relief when it's time for Desmond to join the army, where one of the first soldiers he meets is a narcissistic bodybuilder who loves exercising in the nude (except when it's time for training). But once he opens up at Fort Jackson about being a pacifist, everything stops being funny. He won't even tie a noose knot without it coming out shaped more like a heart. The rest of the army found it completely unthinkable that a soldier was enlisting with no ambition to even touch a gun, so what happens from here is a multitude of mixed emotions and unclear answers.Hacksaw Ridge may seem at first like the typical war movie that resorts to the usual tropes, but experiencing the film proves how it does everything a gigantic leap further from the clichés. The drill sergeant, along with firing out his expected racist insults, also shows his compassionate side when necessary, and the war hero is not depicted as being purely in the right. Rather, he has one thing that's getting in the way of him serving graciously on the battlefield: his pride in his pacifism.That is why on the day of the first battle at Okinawa, it takes a chaotic series of uncomfortably long warfare segments to put this man of God to the test. This recreation of real events show us how this underestimated unarmed soldier saved hundreds of lives just by sticking to the word of God. You'll be surprised even by how he treats the 'enemy' that the army is sent to Hacksaw Ridge to destroy.It's not every day a movie like this comes around: a movie that tells one of the most inspiring true stories to come out of the darkest period of man's history. While everyone else in this nation is concerned about unreliable self-righteous heroes like Batman, Superman, Captain America, Spider-Man, here is a hero who knows the importance of putting other lives ahead of his own, committing his service to unconditional love rather than destruction. Therefore, I encourage the instant-classic Hacksaw Ridge as immediate viewing to all, for the sake of our country and our definition of heroism.",9,3,6,13 January 2017
Me Before You," It's Dangerously Touching... So Yay?
","I'll tell you something good: I really enjoyed this movie. Now I'll tell you something not so good: I probably should not have. Me Before You is all about encouraging young adults to #LiveBoldly and share with the world what they value in life. Done in the fashion of The Fault in Our Stars and Paper Towns, this romantic book-to-film adaptation becomes this summer's great tearjerker.It all starts with our male lead, 31-year-old William Traynor, played by Sam Claflin, who is living the great life of water skiing and high-diving. But then disaster strikes at the blink of an eye: he comes face to headlights with a motorcycle, and he becomes struck with a lifelong condition called Quadriplegia.Quadriplegia is a condition that permanently paralyzes the spine, arms, and legs, causing all sorts of symptoms such as: Loss of bladder and bowel control Pressure sores Blood clots Respiratory problems Autonomic dysreflexia Muscle spasms. It is a very limiting condition that bounds you to a wheelchair and forces you to rely on others for aid in all the little things.Here is when his new caretaker enters the picture. Will seems to be living fine in a wooden apartment with an assistant for his wheelchair, but he needs someone else to help with minor tasks such as eating and getting medications. Her name is Louisa Clark, played by Emilia Clarke. Louisa is 26 and desperate for work. This job requires no experience, so she is quick to accept the position.Here is the film's greatest strength: the way the relationship between these two is developed. Both players are beyond exceptional in their roles. Emilia puts on the sweetest, most adorable facial expressions—watching her wide smile and nervous eyebrows will leave you tumbling in laughter. Sam isn't as strong as his co-lead, but he beautifully contrasts from her lively, exotic personality with his slow, Debbie downer attitude which gradually opens up more as he becomes more comfortable with his caretaker. Even when he's just staring at the castle outside his window like a senior citizen, he makes it so easy for you to connect with him.Everything else that happens to these two is just pure sweetness: he talks her into watching a foreign film with him, she helps him to shave off his facial hair, she tells him about these ridiculous bumblebee tights she always wanted, she struggles to get his wheelchair out of mud, she attempts to get him into a high-class dining restaurant that he doesn't even like, and best of all, they get their moment to dance at a wedding. It's purely believable to see their relationship grow from distant to intimate over six months.That being said, the story needed major alterations. The book's original author Jojo Moyes adapted Me Before You to the screen, and it's clear she doesn't know how the process of an adaptation to screen goes. Her intentions for the emotional aspects of the script are in their proper place, but many of the important moments, particularly in the beginning, are skimmed over and barely given any detail, and it shows more in the rather clumsy third act. In addition, the picture's editor, John Wilson, simply did not let various scenes last long enough to get the full emotional effect.But that's not the worst part. No, the worst part of this film, and the book in that matter, is the message. Without spoiling anything for those of you who haven't read the book, the overall theme justifies suicide as a path to freedom from lifelong suffering. Suicide is often talked about as if it were a decision to live an alternate lifestyle, saying that if someone chooses to kill himself, you just have to let him do it. But how much truth is there to this?Coming from my own experiences, my autism has been an enormous stumbling block, just like Will with Quadriplegia. But what I learned over time, is that what I thought was holding me back was actually setting me up for something better, such as my book on growing up autistic that currently has a 4.5-star rating on Amazon. But it doesn't end there. Do you think Stephen Hawking would have inspired others had he decided to end his life after losing his muscular capabilities? Do you think that Roger Ebert would still be remembered as a well-respected movie critic if he killed himself after losing his jaw? What about Abraham Lincoln? Would our nation still be a slave-free country if he chose to end it after meeting a failure on the job? The devastating thing is, this movie proves that people don't quite understand the value of a disability.Now, Jojo Moyes is right about one thing: you can't change people or the decisions they make. If they choose something beyond the extreme, you're not responsible. But contrary to what Moyes is trying to say in her work, life is always worth living in the very end, even if certain things may momentarily make you feel otherwise. Thus I probably wouldn't recommend the book or the movie for this very reason. But you can go ahead and read and see each of these highly enjoyable works if my praise entices you. Just be aware that no matter what crap you may go through, life is always worth it!Overall Grade: C+",5,1,7,22 June 2016
Sully," Hurray for the Hero of Flight 1549!
","Remember when a plane flew into the Hudson Bay? Remember all 155 passengers on board who miraculously survived the impact? Remember the pilot responsible for making the quick move that prevented this delay from becoming a disaster? ​ Now, seven and a half years after these events shook the world, the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger is brought to the screen by director Clint Eastwood and actor Tom Hanks. Based on the autobiography, 'Highest Duty,' Sully expresses how the passengers' fear was vanquished by their pilot's risky and controversial thinking in a fashion that will inspire dads and business professionals across the nation.It begins with a nightmare by the infamous pilot of his airplane flying uncontrollably into the city, the sounds of the plane booming real enough to rattle you the right way. He wakes up to yet another news report of his catastrophic Flight 1549 landing from January 15, 2009. This reality is simply too overwhelming for him to handle, so much so, that he can't even go jogging without facing a near-hit by a taxi cab. Neither he nor his family can escape from the reporters, talk shows, and high city court who won't shut up about the controversy. It's almost as if 911 is happening all over again, except consequentially by one of America's own heroes.He explains in flashback precisely why he allowed the landing in spite of claims that the left engine could still have been idling. It all follows a nonlinear storytelling structure similar to what Stanley Kubrick or Quentin Tarantino have popularized. Maybe this flashback structure wasn't necessary in the telling of the story, or maybe it just wasn't edited properly. But either way, it got frustratingly confusing as to where or when I was in time, especially when it returns me to a scene that if left off of a half hour earlier.If you were to go ask anyone who was there on that day of the Hudson Bay landing, they would go on to say from backed up evidence that these events are true to what happened; but this retelling doesn't feel quite true enough. Even right from the release of the first trailer, I knew that Tom Hanks wasn't going to fit the part, particularly because he does not look the part at all. Basically all the makeup artists do to make him look authentic is spray-paint his hair white and glue a mustache onto his face, which looks completely unconvincing that he is representing the real flight hero. Then if you look everywhere else around him, there is an excessive amount of branding for New York's culture. The words 'New York' are everywhere within the overused wide-shots of the city, something that not even the fake-looking CGI planes can distract us from.Yet I still wouldn't say that it makes this a horrible viewing experience. Far from it, in fact. Sully is backed up with plenty of satisfactory performances by the whole cast, particularly Aaron Eckhart (The Dark Knight, Thank You for Smoking), who plays Captain Sullenberger's first officer and best friend. There's also Laura Linney (Mystic River, The Truman Show) who plays the captain's stay- at- home wife. She's not the most well-developed or memorable of characters, but her love for her husband still comes out satisfactorily well.Yeah, that's a good word to sum up this movie. It's satisfactory. It's certainly better than average, but not the best thing ever like I hoped it would. It's just plain satisfactory as good, wholesome, inspirational entertainment. It's not that bad for tributing a man who was so big he had an alcoholic beverage named after him (it's made with a shot of Grey Goose Vodka and a splash of water, so feel free to make it at home!)It's also worth noting that the end credits feature some special guest appearances who will make this entire movie truly worth the trip.",6,3,6,9 September 2016
Alien: Covenant," Being a Human No Longer Sounds So Appealing
","A human eye fills the screen.A voice asks, 'How do you feel?'An A.I. portrayed by Michael Fassbender (12 Years a Slave, Steve Jobs) obeys his creator's commands in a pale-white room, looking out onto a gorgeous mountain range. His human 'father' monologues about his ambition to discover where we came from; since there must be more out there past our own present knowledge. No music plays, just the cold voices of these two men with no real blood in their veins. Fassbender delivers a robotic performance appropriate to his character's emotionless state, offering what we expect by now from his two Oscar nominations.Once the familiar opening title slowly dissolves into frame, Ridley Scott has concluded perhaps the most meticulously crafted opening of his long career. But once Alien: Covenant gets the ball rolling, no artistry sustains as he straight-up abandons those crucial points about existentialism.Then we meet a crew transporting 2,000 human embryos to another sector to house future generations (basically Interstellar). Good luck trying to keep track of everyone, as they each have too little likability to give a hoot. Take out the government-funded mission, and their maturity levels would make you believe they were teenagers. Do not even bother asking me to point out the lead protagonist, because I am stumped; my guess goes to Katherine Waterston, (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Inherent Vice) who to be fair is pretty solid in her performance. She may be the closest thing to 'Ellen Ripley' we got here, yet she never causes enough action to entertain both men and women. Sorry ladies, no female empowerment to be found here.We now made it to the eighth installment of the Alien franchise; Ridley Scott gladly back on the helm. You'd think after thirty-eight years, he should know by now that the future may see different racial struggles not predominantly ruled by White heroes. Nope! He calls too much attention to the White actors while all other ethnicities fall victim to the alien invasion problem started by government-funded programs.However, Scott also successfully brought the franchise back to its refreshing hard R-rating like in the early days, even if he sometimes abuses his creative freedom. (Some unnecessary sex foreplay in the shower comes to mind) Otherwise, 20th Century Fox fulfills its promise: after a crew member touches a spore, he goes coughing in his own blood.But beyond the intense gore, every 'scary' moment mishandles the tiresome scare tactics we are sick of by now: jump scares, throwing us into the killer's perspective, an annoying girl runs away while tripping over her own two feet, etcetera.Thus, the best moments take place within the planet's familiar yet evocative greenish mountain views, disguised behind a dense fog. In moments that utilize the atmosphere to tell the story, anyone can sense the contrast between man and alien. Deep inside an abandoned ribcage- shaped ship, Fassbender's A.I. lives. Although the crew keeps a similar version of this same A.I., correspondingly played by the same Fassbender. As the cybernetic twins bond through a flute lesson, they generate most human moment in Ridley Scott's desire to alter society.Too bad though, his continued exploration of man's relationship with technology has no proper footing inside our own reality; these themes seem too stuck in 1979 to strike fear into our hearts. While the added concept of intergalactic recolonization works to its advantage, other recent films, simply put, explored it better, such as Scott's recent instant-classic, The Martian. It seems nobody behind this talky sequel/prequel to Prometheus/Alien could settle on whether to put together a straight-forward horror flick or a psychological metaphor on Trump's immigration ban, so it instead varies scene-by-scene.So why care about humanity's near-extinction? Sounds like way more fun to be a Xenomorph!",3,5,12,19 May 2017
