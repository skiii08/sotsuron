Mission: Impossible III," Poor script, executed even more poorly. A disgrace.
","Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is now retired from the secret services, but he's soon called back by his former employer (Billy Crudup, who used to choose his movies based on the script, not on the hefty paycheck) in order to save a kidnapped agent (Keri Russell, looking for her paycheck too). The mission turns out sour, and Hunt's private life is now on the line as he must protect his wife against a very nasty terrorist (played respectively by Michelle Monaghan and Philip Seymour Hoffmann - I'm sure by now you guessed how such a great cast agreed to star in such an original project...)This first feature film from TV wonder boy JJ Abrams is a train wreck. How could studios execs be stupid enough to give $150 million to a beginner? This guy knows TV for sure, but he probably didn't understand that with so much money you can film action scenes without awkward zooms and irritating shaky camera - these are common TV techniques to hide the cheap scenery and boost the editing, which a big budget feature doesn't need if handled correctly. You hated M:I-2's slow-motion and doves? You'll hate even more this TV episode badly tailored for the big screen.So, where did the money go? The answer is simple: since the director has no clue on what makes a good action scene, he relies on the special effects, like any other Hollywood hack. We're talking about Mission Impossible, a franchise whose staples are intricate and bold thefts, with the team breaking in and out enemy strongholds unnoticed. Here, Abrams thought it would be smarter to shoot useless and god awfully expensive action scenes in exotic locations. Like in a bad 90's James Bond. So, when the hero is setting an aforementioned bold theft in a heavily guarded Chinese building, Abrams cuts to a lame, clich√©d dialogue between his sidekicks waiting in the minivan! Once Tom Cruise re-appears on screen, a pathetic car chase ensues, while the poor spectator is asking himself 'why in HELL did they chose not to film the goddamn hold up???'Because they were too lazy to write and shoot what is the heart and soul of the series. Because it would have been too great an effort for the so-called writers to write anything original. The movie is such a rip-off of 'True Lies' it's not even funny. European break-in: CHECK. Hero forced to collaborate with enemy: CHECK. Bridge attacked by jet fighter: CHECK. Daughter/wife in distress: CHECK. The list goes on and on... And don't expect any teamwork: Tom Cruise IS the star, and he wants everyone to know that. No one can shine except him. They're not allowed to.Bottom line: avoid it, unless you have a knack for bad movies.",2,0,0,14 June 2007
"I, Robot"," Another bland blockbuster, unworthy of Proyas' talent. What a waste.
","This could have been so much better. Now that Will Smith got rid of his mannerisms and put himself on the line with 'Ali', one could think he'd never consider to lower himself to star in such a terribly written, poorly conceived film. Well, obviously he hasn't learned from his past mistakes.Smith plays Detective Del Spooner, who works for the Chicago Police Department in the year 2035. Robots are now a part of our everyday life. They are everywhere, can do everything. They're ruled by 3 Robotic Laws preventing them from harming any human and even so, Spooner is doubtful about them. His suspicions seem to be founded when a scientist working on a new type of robots is killed. And all the evidences lead to a robotic murderer, which the aforementioned Laws should never let happen...It's amazing how visionary Alex Proyas (whose 'Dark City' is arguably one of the the best Science-Fiction film ever made) completely missed the mark with 'I, Robot'. He's not helped by a terrible screenplay from Akiva Goldsman, probably one of the worst screenwriters in activity. Will Smith's attitude, as if he was still on the set of Bad Boys or Wild Wild West, doesn't help either, nor the consistent and highly irritating product placement (think of a Bond movie, but ten times more prominent...). The supporting cast is bland (Bridget Moynagan) when not annoying (Shia LaBeouf) and the action is just visually and emotionally boring.A real letdown.",4,0,1,11 June 2007
Quantum of Solace," Good, relentless action film. But still a leap back compared to Casino Royale...
","In a nutshell: I, for one, found Bond's latest 'Quantum of Solace' quite enjoyable but with some annoying flaws. Almost non-stop action with some sarcastic bits of humor (but never to the point of making the hero look silly or ridicule himself, like a Roger Moore 007, or Downey's Iron Man more recently) and all-around good acting. On the other hand the script is weak and quite messy, uselessly convoluted for the paper-thin story it tells. Direction-wise this is *not* a cheap Bourne rip-off as some people have claimed here and there. It truly feels like a Bond movie. The action is frenetic, filmed pretty much in the same vein as 'Casino Royale', which is a good thing. Sure, there are some bold tracking shots and not-so-steady cam, but never to the point of being too shaky. It's used efficiently, not in a show-off way. A Bond movie has to be spectacular and if clearly not groundbreaking that one hits the mark.But as far as I'm concerned, the rest wasn't as tight. The direction is somewhat repetitive (especially when establishing one of the countless new locations, when the director abuses of music and multiple cuts to amp up the exposition scenes, as if the action scenes weren't titillating enough). The story is poorly introduced and it gets worse with every new character hitting the screen. As for the usually excellent Mathieu Amalric playing the main baddie, he's given too few too late to really shine. His very last scene with Daniel Craig is really good, the fights are brutal and the guy clearly has the charisma to stand against Bond, but plot-wise he's really wasted. Now, for the lame mistakes they cleverly avoided: no Michael Bay editing style. No - or at least very few - obnoxious product placement. No annoying or miscast Bond Girl. The movie is not shying away from the violence, with possibly one of the highest body-counts in the whole franchise. This is still the assassin Bond we're given (with another great performance from Daniel Craig), not the caricatured spy. The opening title sequence is being designed by newcomers in the Bond universe and they made a very good job, blending all the ingredients without being too flashy and that actually benefits the song from Jack White and Alicia Keys. I found said song much more enjoyable during the credits than without them - where 'Casino Royale' gave me the exact opposite feeling. Unfortunately, almost everything else was handled more firmly by Martin Campbell and the producers in 2006. Marc Forster does a decent job and took some interesting decisions regarding the tone as well as some specific scenes (without spoiling much, I'd say that his use of Puccini's 'Tosca' was quite original) but sometimes too much action is detrimental, even to an action movie.All in all, a good but flawed Bond movie whose downsides could have been easily avoided. Following 'Casino Royale' was doubly harmful; not only because of its inherent quality, but also for the writers' mishandling of its legacy. If the next Bond tries again to tie some loose ends from 'Quantum of Solace', I just hope they'll learn from their mistakes and give it a more coherent feel. No one wants to suffer the decreasing quality of the post-GoldenEye Bonds again, right?",6,3,6,31 October 2008
Fantastic Four," Boring and stupid.
","Fantastic Four is probably the worst comic book movie to date. This sub-genre contains a lot of great films (Superman, Burton's and Nolan's Batman, Hellboy...) but this one is a true disgrace, and really gives comic books a bad name. The basic story could be turned into a great sci-fi movie for kids and adults. Think of high-concept movies like Back To The Future, or Lost in Space: whether you like them or not they're great family films, with both great effects, a good cast, and some science fiction themes tailored for the whole family. Fantastic Four got nothing: the cast is mediocre (except maybe Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis), the direction is atrocious, the script is stupid and the practical SFX worthy of a B-grade movie (the Thing costume is truly laughable, which is quite annoying since the character carries most of the dramatic moments...)If you really want to feed your kids with the dumbest mass-produced Hollywood trash, give it a try. But don't expect your kids to develop good tastes after that. BUT if you don't wanna dumb down your children with the worst kind of entertainment you could possibly find, AVOID AT ALL COSTS. My advice: rent Pixar's 'The Incredibles' instead. It's smarter, faster and funnier.",2,6,10,14 June 2007
Gladiator," A decent B-grade Peplum turns into an overblown blockbuster.
","...and if you think that 'overblown blockbuster' is a pleonasm, wait until you see this movie. Even if it's not completely shabby, the amount of self-indulgent, ham fisted dialogue coupled with the sheer stupidity of the script makes one wonder...Ridley Scott used to be a visionary. Which doesn't really translate in his poor rendition of the ancient Rome. Colors, framework, costumes: the art direction is very weak. The script is so formulaic and falsely clever it's almost insulting. And the editing rarely shines. The action is either boring or gives serious headaches; only one scene really stands out: Maximus (painfully portrayed by a sleepwalking Russel Crowe) leads his enslaved friends to victory by resorting on their old warrior reflexes. Nothing really shines except that scene; the supporting cast is bland (Connie Nielsen) when not irritating (the usually great Joaquin Phoenix gives a really bad performance as the emperor Commodus).But the most hilariously bad moment is the climactic battle: Ridley Scott and the hack who wrote this should be ashamed. The whole movie tries to re-write history (I'm not even calling that revisionism) introducing modern, Christian philosophical and moral values in the story through Maximus' perception. If we trusted the movie, Rome was a beacon in a world of barbarians. This ends up giving the hero the upper hand in a duel against Commodus, avenging his family with the sacrifice of his life. This whole ending, not only ridiculous on screen, is truly aimed at the blood-thirsty audience who needs his fix of 'eye-for-an-eye' climax to feel satisfied, like in a good ol' 'Death Wish' Bronson flick. Not only this is an historical lie (too bad for a movie that tries so hard to feel 'realistic'), but it really misses the mark emotionally as the real demise of the emperor showed true poetic justice, as opposed to the self-righteous, overwrought lines Crowe delivers.As for the 'revisionism' complaint, I'm asking you: what if, 2000 years from now, a screenwriter comes up with a WWII epic comic book movie (not unlike a peplum of our times) where Captain America (Maximus) single-handedly defeats Hitler (Commodus)? Well, it *may* turn out good. If Ridley Scott isn't directing.",4,3,10,16 June 2007
