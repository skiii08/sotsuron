National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Omg
","That's it. No comment. IQ heavily insulted.This movie is 2 hours too long - complete waste of time. First NT was also too long but at least had some fresh ideas. I knew what to expect from this movie but I didn't expect much so I wouldn't be disappointed. Well, the movie managed to bore me despite me being prepared for it. Ignore the 'logic' and random events in the movie and it's still bad. Chop the plot and leave 1/5 of it and it would still be boring.No disrespect for the actors (they were great, sometimes funny) but I felt like I was watching a movie about retards. Sry.PS clues were so easy to guess for the characters, maybe next time decrease the number of the clues but make them harder to get",1,1,2,16 March 2010
Little Miss Sunshine," Just see the number of goofs and then tell me it's Oscar worth
","OMG. This is even worse then Meet the Spartans. How the hell can this movie have a rating of 8+??? Here's a quick review of the characters...Dad - a moron. I stopped the movie when he wisely decided to steal the corpse. Jesus! More funny thing would be if Olive had suggested that. LOL.Mom - same as her husband. Idiotic.Olive - cute but stupid. More funny would be if she had farted all the time during the trip. LOL Dwayne - just as I began to think he has the most cleverness of all the characters, he jumps onto the stage...Grandpa - he was funny but not that funny Frank - he's OK (because he wanted to commit a suicide) LOL Comedy? You are supposed to laugh when you watch a comedy, right? Or something have changed? Just click the button goofs and see for yourself if it's worth winning an Oscar. Drama? Suicide, death, failure... I've seen better. Top 250 on IMDb? Man, I really think high of IMDb ratings but this is just too shallow.Recommendation - life is short... too short for watching this piece of s**t.",1,3,7,5 July 2008
Apocalypse Now," What a mess, don't say I didn't understand it cause I did
","I am always as real as it gets and I'm first to say 'the king is naked'.The first hour of the movie is a good setup. You are anxious to see the lunatic general and what's so special about him. The second hour of the movie is soooo booorrring. They travel along the river for sooo loong. Here and there someone dies but it's still endless. That dinner part is also very long and kills the flow if the movie had it at all in the first place. I fell asleep couple of times. And then in the third hour you expect a final confrontation and suspense but instead you are given a totally anticlimactic ending. I again fell asleep couple of times during general's looooong and quiet speeches.So in short, the setup was good but there was no tension throughout the movie and it was killed even more by long pointless chaotic scenes. People on drugs rate this as a 10. It's not.",4,2,9,17 April 2019
Get Out," People on drugs voting
","I don't even know where to start. Genre - First off, do people today even know what the word 'horror' mean??? Cause this... was no where near horror genre. Couple of kills doesn't make it a horror. Plot - The idea is OK but the realization is poor. Why? Because the build up in the first half of the movie is soooo boring beyond belief and then the second half of the movie is kind of rushed. All the killings in the end happened so fast in a pretty simple way without any suspense. Cast - The family acted OK but the main character and his friend stole the show for me.Level of entertainment - Not so good. It was OK to fill 2 hours but the movie is forgettable, no parts are worth mentioning and I wouldn't be crazy to watch it again (ever) or recommend to my friends.My review/score is more negative then it should be just to balance the IMDb score that was achieved by people on drugs. ;)",4,4,9,24 June 2017
The Witch," Fell asleep in the first 20 minutes...
","My description of the movie could be reduced to one sentence - wtf. So damn idle and boring, half of the scenes don't even have anything to do with the plot nor in any way contribute to the development of the plot or the characters. As if they were thrown in randomly without any sense. Between some scenes there are 5 seconds of black image - what is the purpose of that? Also why is Caleb looking at Thomasin's tits twice in the first half an hour? Wtf? Aren't they brother and sister? This movie could easily be shortened by a whole hour and again it would be so boring. This is not a horror film, this is a bland faceless crap. People who have given a good grade obviously do not watch a lot of movies and those who say that this film is tense (LOL) should watch for example Inglorious basterds or Django to learn what the word 'tense' means.",2,1,8,21 May 2016
Arrival," Pretty boring
","This could have been a much better movie but it is so dragged out and everything is going very slowly. No suspense at all. No entertainment. No nothing. The movie could have easily taken 30 minutes less. The idea is good but too much drama destroyed potentially interesting movie. The movie is totally forgetful and the only situation worth retelling is the part with gravity in the beginning. I do not know why there are so many good user ratings and reviews. This movie is slow, dull, dragged out and forgetful. I gave it a 4 only because it was filmed at all. I assume that those who gave it an 8 or more do not watch a lot of movies because I just can't justify the high scores with anything else. Oh yea. There might be the possibility of being on drugs while watching the movie then giving it an 8. ;)To sum it up - I would not recommend this movie.",4,12,23,8 March 2017
Creed II," I rooted for Drago to kill Creed and put an end to this franchise
","I mean, seriously. The main character in this one is so annoying and stubborn that you don't care for him. That is a big fail because you should root for the main character. The idea of a movie was excellent but the presetation failed misereably. Drago Jr. idea had so much more potential than this boring, depressing and dragged out cash grab. Too much drama, too little action. Also, since it's so predictable, there was too little thrill or suspense. This is nowhere near 7, don't trust the ratings. I suspect they are fake, bought or whatever.",3,1,2,17 March 2019
