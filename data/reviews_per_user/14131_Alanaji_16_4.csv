It," 'Best Horror Movie Of 2017'
","IT directed by Andi Muscheitti is a coming-of-age horror thriller. It's not just another horror movie where the makers try to scare the viewers by throwing too much violence on screen. This film has a well made script which talks about friendships, fears within teenagers, their bonding and so on. The film tells us the story of seven kids led by a kid names Bill, who are bullied,who find themselves in a situation facing a demon names Penniwise, the dancing clown. For any horror movie to work out, it should have the fear factor which IT has and that too in well proportions. I would like to mention the scenes which scared me out of hell but it would doing injustice to the movie. Those scenes are to be experienced. But the film, as I said before, does not rely too heavily on the horror factor but also has its own light moments. The bond between the characters are done well and you feel for them, such is the way of presentation. Technically too, the film does not disappoint. The Music and the Background Score (Benjamin Wallfisch) was terrific. The cinematography (Chung-hoon Chung) was also good. Editing (Jason Ballentine) was done neatly. Performance wise, every actors have done their roles neatly. Be it Jaeden as 'Bill' or Bill Skarsgard as 'Pennywise', all were good. So make sure that you watch this movie or should I say you your own time for IT. My rating: 4/5",8,1,3,26 October 2017
Deadpool 2," 'DEADPOOL 2'- MY REVIEW
","HE IS BACK!!! And this time he isn't alone. Back in 2016, we saw the rise of an anti - hero, Deadpool, who was foul mouthed but at the same time witty and adorable. So fortunately, the expectations for DP2 will be higher. So how's the film? Let's take a look. But before that the plot... Wade Wilson a.k.a Deadpool is a now a well know mercenary. After the murder of his wife Vanessa, he decides to commit suicide, but is saved in time by Colossus, who in turn asks him to join the X - men. Meanwhile, DP takes the responsibility of protecting a mutant child, Russelles a.k.a Firefist from a time travelling soldier Cable. 
 That's all I can tell u about the plot. The film is however slightly better than the first part. Anyway, that doesn't , mean that it's devoid of R rated violence . There r cuss words, body being teared apart, wire plugged into a#@ and so on. Anyway this is the best superhero movie this year along with Infinity war. The technical parts of the film were all good. Be it the usage of the background score during action scenes or the visual effects, all were done neatly. Dialogues were witty and has a lot of references to the old and latest released films. Action scenes were slick and not overdone. Editing was good , but there was some dragging felt towards the middle portion. 
 Now to the performances. Ryan Reynolds just rocked as Deadpool. His performance is sure to be appreciated. Josh Brolin as Cable was at par with Reynolds. Also the reference to his character, 'THANOS' was funny. Another memorable performance was that of Zazie Beetz as Domino. Stefan Kapicic as Colossus had a small role but his scenes with DP are sure to bring in laugh out loud moments. Rest of the supporting cast were good, especially Karan Soni as Dopinder.
So all in all, DP 2 is superior than its first part . Go in and have a BLAST..... My rating- 4/5
P.S: Don't miss the mid credit scenes. They r the best seen in recent times....",8,2,5,22 July 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," 'AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR'- MY REVIEW
","Avengers: Infinity War, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo( who gave us the terrific Civil War and The Winter Soldier), is what we can term as a satisfying summer spectacle. This is not a film. It's an event. In a film with more than 20 superheroes, not once does one feel that any one of them are underutilized. The plot, as you all know , is about the conquest by Thanos (who is a computer generated character and given a terrific motion capture performance by Josh Brolin), to conquer all the 6 infinity stones and to wipe out half the universe. It's all up to the Avengers along with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop his evil plans. That's all I can tell u about the plot. Because revealing too much will kill the experience. The director(s) have packed in all they can - marvelous action set pieces, humour, twists and dramatic moments etc.... Almost all the department have done their jobs neatly. Be it the stunning VFX or the exhilarating background score , the film has it all. The climax, I would like to mention, is not at all what you would expect, especially since this is a Marvel movie. Also the character deaths too will come across as a shock. 
 
Now coming to the performances, the list is going to be too long if I mention each and every actor. Everyone has done their roles perfectly and not once do you feel that a single character is given prominence. But a special mention has to be definitely given to Brolin for his outstanding performance. He is a villain that's menacing and heartwarming at the same time. Hats off for the director(s) for undertaking a project of this magnificience. So all in all this an experience or should I say THIS IS the Marvel movie we all waited for. So go in and have a Blast. My rating- 4.5/5 P.S: Do not miss the END CREDITS...",Null,1,5,20 July 2018
Black Panther," 'BLACK PANTHER'- My Review
","Just like we were introduced to Asgard in the Thor trilogy (although it was more fun in the the third movie), Black Panther introduces us to Wakanda, a place/Kingdom, hidden from the outside world in the continent of Africa.
Directed by Ryan Coogler, The plot follows the events after Captain America: Civil War, where T'Challa a.k.a. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman ) , is to be crowned the king of Wakanda where he have to face his nemesis in the form of Erik 'Killimonger' (Michael. B. Jordan) who has a past related to Wakanda.
Now I have to say that this is a more matured movie after Civil War. There is action and fun in good amount but the story is given more depth. Add to that the African Culture and background gives the film a new look and from the view of the MC universe.
Technical matters of the film are all done well. Be it the Cinematography, Editing ,Action or the exhilarating Background score..
Now to the performances...
Chadwick Boseman has done a perfect job as The Black Panther. Although he appeared in a brief role in Civil war, the depth of his character was felt more in this film. Equally brilliant was Michael B Jordan in a negative role bringing in the required menace and can be considered another best villain in the MC universe. The supporting cast was efficient. The ones who require a mention is Daniel Kaluyya,
Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Lupita Nyong'o and Letita Wright. Andy Serous in a small role has done well.
So all in all Black Panther is another feather in the cap of the MC universe and is a must watch...
My rating: 4/5",Null,3,9,21 February 2018
