Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," note
","after reading a lot of these comments I am finding one main theme, most of the critics revolve around comparing episode 1 to all 3 of the old movies. Just think about that for a second, comparing one movie to a 3 part series, instead of part 1 of a new 3 part series. Too many critics not spending the time to think about that too much, anyone that does read these needs to remember the movie is worth seeing a couple times, especially if you go and see movies normally, none of the other big blockbuster movies in the past 10+ years have been this good.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
