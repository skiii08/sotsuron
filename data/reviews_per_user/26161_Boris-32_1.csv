Antz," Sorry... just did not like it
","I personally hated this movie.  I know most people liked it but I found it more of a demonstration of the latest animation capabilities rather than a good movie.  I did not find it overly funny and the kids were bored with it quickly.  Maybe it's one of those 'be in the right mood when you watch it' movies, but sorry to say... I thought the movie was poor.",Null,0,0,5 March 1999
