It," Just read the book
",Good effects and skarsgard does a great job as pennywise but splitting it into two movies was a bad idea.,7,0,2,5 August 2018
Rocketman," Trash.
","LGBTQ trash, nothing more. We were hoping for a story focusing on Elton's life and not his sexuality, much like Bohemian Rhapsody, but they missed the chance to ride its coat tails by producing this sad excuse for a movie. Don't waste your time!",1,3,20,25 September 2019
Captain Marvel," It's Interplanet Janet in our house.
",Just another PC comic movie made of culminations of every sci-Fi movie made. Samuel L Jackson and the cat are the only reason I gave it 3 stars.,3,2,3,28 June 2019
Last Flag Flying," Good but has some whinny additions included
","As a Marine, there are some great scenes that brought back some great memories......BUT, they just had to add some tree-huggin-hippie crap that kept it from being better.",5,1,2,2 June 2018
U-571," Lots of PC plugs
","Not very historically accurate and many PC plugs, but overall a decent movie. Actors all did a decent job for the most part.",5,0,0,15 January 2020
The Shining," Jack is great but the rest is blah
",I understand why Stephen King was so disappointed in this movie. Didn't follow any of the good stuff from the book. Shelly and Danny plod through their parts like watching grass grow. Bad casting and not following the novel doomed this one.,5,3,8,4 August 2019
Dunkirk," What the heck did I just watch????
","This movie was SO hard to follow. The timeline jumps around, telling the same story, three to four times and just confuses the viewer. They used actual Supermarine Spitfires and Spanish copies of the Bf109 and He111 which was exciting, but the scenes they were used it were just outlandish and unbelievable! The whole movie seems to miss the point. Dunkirk was an important part of WWII and it never really tells the story. This could have, and should have, been a much better movie, but sadly, isn't.",3,2,3,9 January 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," What?????????
","Horrible storyline, horrible writing, bad acting. Don't waste your time.",2,15,28,5 August 2018
