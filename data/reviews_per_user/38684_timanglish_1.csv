Hereditary," Give me 2hrs 7mins of my life back!
","I hated this movie
Everyone else in my screening hated this movie
Everyone I know who has seen it hated this movie
How it's IMDB score is as high as it is I don't know!
This is my first review on IMDB and I felt compelled to write it to warn people because it was so bad
Half an hour in, it was so slow I was battling to stay awake
I didn't particularly care for any of the characters
As Toni Collette descended into madness I found her highly irritating
I only made it to the end because I had gone to see it with people - if i'd of been on my own i'd of walked out at the point I referred to IMDB to see how long it was and saw it was 2hrs 7mins!If it was knocked down to about 80mins it would probably be an okay-ish movie but it was more like torture having to sit through it for what seemed like forever!",1,587,1194,18 June 2018
