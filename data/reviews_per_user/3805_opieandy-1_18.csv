The Finest Hours," Salvaged by Great Storyline
","SPOILER ALERT.I wanted to caption this 'Salvaged by Fabulous Ending' but that would have been a spoiler in itself. But that's my real title.Why is it so hard to make good sea movies? The music and setting of this reminded me of so many TV movies. But the understated approach paid off at the end, and I could not stop the tears.The movie plays off a fantastic real-life rescue by some very brave Coast Guard seamen. It will make you proud to be a human.I had the movie as a '6' until the last 5 minutes. '6' is just below the point I'll rewatch a movie, and '7' is my minimum rating for a 'good', rewatchable movie. I might have gone with 6.5 if IMDb had half ratings.About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of 'terrible', with 5 being 'mediocre' 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A Classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating)",7,1,4,27 June 2016
Hereditary," Creepy. Deepy. Doo.
","Wow,, what a ride. A deliberately paced first half precedes a thrilling second half. The pivotal early event in the story at first struck me as dubious, but by the end, I appreciated it. HGav me chills. Enjoy.",7,1,3,17 September 2018
The Hateful Eight," Long, slow, boring
","I don't mind slow movies that build tension or ... something. This one drips. Like a slow leaky faucet you can't turn off or all the way on. Like a horse-drawn carriage in a blizzard, it's going somewhere but taking an unnecessarily long time to get there. Cinematography? Check. Acting? Check. Interesting or dramatic or fun or engaging? Uncheck.About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of 'terrible', with 5 being 'mediocre' 6- OK.

Armageddon," Stripes/Meatballs in Space
","The only things missing from this farce were Murray, Belushi, Aykroyd, Guttenberg, and Candy.Sheesh. This movie could not figure out what it wanted to be. An epic story of saving mankind or a slapstick comedy. Trying to be both, it missed the mark.Thanks to the fantastic cast, not all was lost. But it seemed like a big-budget variation of a SyFy channel movie. The 'special effects' were way overdone and beyond any possible semblance of the realm of reality. The idea that a band of oil rigging roughnecks could learn to fly a spaceship in a few days is an insult to everyone in the space program. The idea that we could land a spaceship going 22,500 mph on a meteor moving 22,500 mph is beyond ludicrous. And the movie should have been about an hour shorter.Otherwise, I loved it.4 stars only because I liked most of the cast.About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of 'terrible', with 5 being 'mediocre' 6- OK.

Bridge of Spies," Well done
","Well-acted, well-written, well-directed, well-produced. Spielberg and the Coen brothers take an interesting episode in world history and craft a compelling, dramatic story.

The Usual Suspects," What?
","At an 8.6 IMDb rating, this movie makes my hall of fame for most overrated movies of all-time. Jumping back and forth in time not done very well. Characters not compelling. Points for good cast and acting. No points for compelling and interesting.

The Imitation Game," Needlessly Boring
","I knew little of this story prior to the movie. Perhaps that made me have a little higher standards than others for its execution. It was presented in a very matter-of-fact style with little drama compelling the viewer to engage, reminiscent of other movies of its ilk which I also found boring. The acting and production were good, but the storyline itself was just missing something to really captivate the reader and make this more than a documentary. There certainly was a human element to the story, and the characters themselves perhaps were just as boring in real life, yet there is a way to present such characters without compromising the entertainment value of the story.If you are familiar with the story, you will likely enjoy this much more than I did. If you are not familiar with the story and are looking for entertainment, I would pass.",5,3,6,24 February 2015
Pulp Fiction," Revolting Travoltaing But Still Good
","Really like the style and feel of this flick. The opening in the Diner really drew me in. Actually, it raised my expectations to a level that the movie did not meet, though I still rate it an 8, which is very high on my scale.Tha alternating time sequences took a little getting used to, and the film dragged in parts. I felt the entire scene with the Wolf could have been cut or significantly edited with very little loss of entertainment value. The film was a bit self-indulgent in that regard. 2:34 alone tells you that. Nevertheless, it was highly entertaining, even if looking at Travolta's hair was revolting.About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of 'terrible', with 5 being 'mediocre' 6- OK.

The Witch," 5 minutes

"Hail, Caesar!"," Snoozefest

Hitch," Funny, cute twist on a rom-com
","Good actors, a witty script, and an engaging plot are a recipe for an entertaining movie, which is what Hitch is.

Deadpool," LOL Funny
","Humor, like most things, is a matter of taste.Several good friends of mine with generally similar senses of humor to mine love the movie Tommy Boy. I hated Tommy Boy. Go figure. Different strokes. So I'm never surprised at 'bipolar' reviews for a film.That said, OH. MY. GOD., I LOVED this movie. LOL funny. As in, I was literally laughing out loud throughout the movie. I've never seen Ryan Reynolds in this type of role, but he nailed it. He channeled his inner Will Ferrell and kept me in stitches. The humor, the sarcasm, the irony, the comic timing, the inside jokes, the chemistry among the key characters, it was all just nearly perfect. I don't give a lot of '9' ratings, especially for comedies -- I've rated ~470 movies, with 29 of those earning 9 or 10, and of those, only 1-2 romcoms -- but this flick earned it from me. Rarely do I buy the DVD of a movie just after watching it on demand. But I immediately ordered the DVD because I know I will watch this multiple times with different friends.",9,2,8,8 June 2016
Moon," Wake me when it starts
","Oh. My. God. Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacehead move this along at a cosmically boring pace. There are no words. Well, the SF Gate review has my words:''Moon' is boring. Agonizingly, deadeningly, coma-inducingly, they-could- bury-you-alive-accidentally boring.You know how astronauts walk on the moon, slowly, in heavy boots, through a light atmosphere? That's how the action moves in 'Moon.''I appreciate slow-moving, thoughtful movies such as Duel and The Last Picture Show. But these movies had a point and the slow pace contributed to the storyline. This one didn't and doesn't. Blah. The most interesting aspect of this movie is that {classic movie trailer voice} in a world where consumers crave action, this paint-dripper has garnered such positive reviews. Reeks of a conspiracy.",2,3,8,31 January 2016
The Godfather," Quantity Does Not Equal Quality
","I guess the same kind of folks who made The Sopranos one of the highest-rated TV shows in history made this film a 9.2 on IMDb. I sure don't get it. I think there is also a slight bias towards rating longer movies higher. Quantity does not equal, or compensate for the lack of, quality.Star-studded cast? Check. Outstanding director? Check. Dramatic and compelling plot? No.A drama should be dramatic. It should be compelling. We should care about the outcome. This film achieved none of those objectives.Some have lauded it as a fantastic sketch of organized crime. I suppose if you think of it more as a fictional docudrama, maybe your expectations would allow you to enjoy it more.The only compelling aspect of the film was the progression of Michael Corleone. The movie did bring that full circle, and I will dance around the details here to avoid spoilers. Nevertheless, that one somewhat interesting aspect was not enough to redeem the movie. And even in that aspect, the film did nothing to make the viewer CARE about Michael or why he evolved as he did.About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of 'terrible', with 5 being 'mediocre' 6- OK.
