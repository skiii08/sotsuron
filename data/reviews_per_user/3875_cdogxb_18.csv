Alien 3," 3 Times the Suspense! 3 Times the Danger! 3 Times the Terror! 3 star from me
","This movie is a sequel. A sequel to both an amazing horror film, Alien, and a pretty entertaining action film, Aliens. And this is want we get. A dull, uninspired, uninteresting sequel, where Ripleys character is extremely unlikable and devoid of any personality or emotion. Don't even get me started on the plot. This movie is closer to a 2, but it's Alien3, therefore a 3 is what I'll give it.",3,1,3,15 October 2019
Alien: Resurrection," Aliens should've ended the series
","Alien3 sucked, and this movie is garbage. The plot is just  stupid and I just wish Alien could've ended.",3,1,3,15 October 2019
Us," A solid thriller
","Get Out was a pretty good movie, so I had some high expectations for this one. It didn't quite deliver. This was a solid movie, with a few issues like pacing and unnecessary exposition. The twist also felt a bit fake based on the characters interactions in the movie. Its enjoyable with great acting and action, but a bit of a letdown.",6,0,0,16 October 2019
Spider-Man 3," Underrated
",This is a film I feel gets unnecessary hate. I find it to be mostly hilarious. As a comedy it's pretty top tier. Yes it's messy but it's funny tho,6,0,0,5 June 2020
The Terminator," A classic
","This is a very enjoyable sci-fi, almost horror, movie. I love Schwarzenegger as the Terminator and Linda Hamilton is pretty good as well. The opening scene is great, and the movie has some great action and suspense. I enjoy the sequel more, but this is a great predecessor.",7,1,1,20 October 2019
Hot Rod," A pretty hilarious comedy
","Every scene contains something to cause laughter, whether it's an over enthusiastic Asian doing the same awful dance move over and over, or Bill Hader with a giant chunk of glass in the side of his face. Any fan of Nacho Libre or Napoleon Dynamite will absolutely love this movie.",6,1,2,13 October 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A sequel that surpasses its predecessor
","I would say I enjoy Judgement Day more than the first one. This is due to more action, incredible special effects, and the Terminator being the good guy. Both Terminators are completely badass in this movie, resulting in some entertaining fight scenes. My only complaints is that John Connor and his mother were both in their own way annoying at times, so that I didn't entirely like them. I found myself liking the T-1000s character more somehow. But besides a few plot holes, this was great.",10,0,1,20 October 2019
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Original as hell
","This is one of the best movies of the 21st century. Fun, inventive, and hilarious, this is what a comic book movie should be. One of my favorite movies right now and I implore anyone reading this to go watch it right now.",9,0,2,20 October 2019
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Yes
","This is what a horror comedy should be. Hilarious, grossly gory, and a good underlying theme as well. I was never bored and every scene made me laugh. A mix of Napoleon Dynamite and Evil Dead 2.",7,0,0,20 October 2019
Insidious," Scary at times but...
","This is definitely one of the better horror films of 2010. It had justified jump scares, a creepy premise, a genuinely disturbing soundtrack, and creepy ghosts to top it off. But it's a bit of wasted potential. There were moments I almost laughed at some of the CG and the narrative becomes a little too unbelievable as well. But when compared to more recent films like The Nun or La Llorona, this movie is a more than a cut above.",5,0,0,13 October 2019
Evil Dead," One of the better remakes
","I didn't watch this as a remake of the original; I watched it as it's own film. And I'm glad I did, because it's a whole different film. It's got the Necronomicon and the deadites, but it's very much it's own film.
I had no expectations for it, but it was a dark and gritty surprise. It didn't rely on jumpscares and it delivered some of the most gory violence I have ever seen in a mainstream movie. It may have bad character choices, but the logic behind it is admirable. Definitely a movie for gore hounds and horror fans only, but it isn't bad, and I could definitely watch it again.",5,0,1,3 January 2020
Evil Dead," Gory as hell
","I was unsure about this sequel/remake as soon as I heard of its more serious tone. The reason Evil Dead 2 is one of my favorite 80s movies is bc of its campiness and comedy. But this movie delivered a worthy addition to the franchise. The gore is nasty and completely uncensored, and I can safely say this is one of the most gory movies I've ever seen. This movie also feels very slickly produced. I didn't care about the characters, but I don't think that's really the point. The plot is also surprisingly smart, as a character is a recovering heroine addict and her seeing the Evil is excused as hallucination. Solid remake.",5,0,1,20 October 2019
Mama," Solid
","This is yet another just 'ok' horror flick. It is decently imaginative and creepy, and I was surprised at how dark it was for a PG-13 movie. The pros of this movie are it's dark tone, Mamas creature design, the creepy settings, and the acting. It's cons are how short it feels, lack of suspense, and the overall held back feeling of the plot.",5,0,0,4 November 2019
The Witch," Don't listen to bad reviews
","This is a great movie, effectively chilling and disturbing. The cinematography is exceptional, the story is well written, and the dialogue is very realistic to that time period. If you don't like slow building horror, this isn't for you, but if you want something different than most modern horror, watch this.",8,2,3,13 October 2019
Army of Darkness," I don't understand the hate
","Evil Dead 2 is one of my favorite movies from the 80s, so I naturally wanted to see what would happen to Ash after his transportation to medieval times. I am pleased to say that this movie caps off the Evil Dead trilogy in hilarious fashion, even if it leaves out the series trademark over the top gore to do so. I had no problems with it's tame ness- it still kept the weird slapstick I loved in its predecessor. I'm annoyed at people who like the Evil Dead 2 but claim to hate this movie. It contains the same humor and campy fun that drove that movie, but it feels more polished.",9,3,5,20 October 2019
Inception," Incredible
","This is the rare film that I give a 10/10 with no doubt in my mind that it is completely deserved.
Everything about this movie is extremely well crafted, from its plot to its characters to its incredible effects and its great action sequences.
This is a movie everyone must see in their lifetime.",8,1,2,20 October 2019
The Matrix," Yes
","This is the best action movie ever made. It's dark, dull visuals are great, it's fight scenes are revolutionary, and the special effects still hold up. The plot is original and the characters are just badass. 10/10",8,0,0,20 October 2019
Evil Dead II," GROOVY!
","This is movie is a blend of 80s campiness, slapstick, and fun gore that makes it, in my opinion, the best horror comedy to date. Fair warning: it's pretty gross and low budget, and I know people that hate this movie. If you are a fan of any other movies in this series, you'll think this one is amazing.",10,1,2,20 October 2019
