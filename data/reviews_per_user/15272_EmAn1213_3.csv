Ali," Better if You're an Ali Fan
","Seeing 'Ali' is like going to the opera: you need to familiarize yourself with the story before you go. Brush up on not only Ali's career stats, but on his personal info as well. If you don't, you'll probably be confused through much of the movie, like I was. The movie tends to spend a lot of time on one scene, then leaps ahead several months or even years with no explanation. Ali gets new wives and has kids, but the movie doesn't even stop long enough to let you know that he had gotten divorced from the previous wife. My dad, however, who is obsessed with Ali and is quite familiar with his life story, really enjoyed the movie. It is an entertaining and nicely done movie, but if you don't already know what's going to happen, the confusion and frustration is very distracting.",5,0,0,29 January 2002
A Hard Day's Night," The original rock n' roll movie!
","'A Hard Day's Night' is a great film for Beatle fans, but even non-Beatle maniacs can appreciate the great British humor, stylish cinematography, and on screen hijinks. This movie is shot to somewhat look like a documentary, or an actual day in the life of the Beatles. The outcome is wonderfully innocent on the outside, and devilishly rebellious on the inside, much like the Beatles themselves. The movie follows the Beatles, their two comical managers, and Paul's cranky grandfather as they travel from trains, studios, clubs, all around London, and back to the studio again. The humor is at times very intellectual, at other times, purely visual. Another treat for Beatle fans is that much of the humor is simply the Beatles being themselves.  Though the film is not a documentary, it actual does a good job of portraying the Beatles' real personalities and gives the audience a feel of their hectic, confined, touring days. There's also a great concert scene which, if you use your imagination, is almost like being there yourself. I gave this movie an 8. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially those who love the Beatles or have an appreciation of British, Monty Python-style humor.",8,3,3,28 January 2002
Bring It On," I just don't get it
","'Is this movie for real?!' That's all I could think the first time I saw this film. The story follows the Rancho Carne Toros cheerleading team and their captain Torrance (Kirstin Dunst) as they make their way through the tumultuous world of cheerleading. The Toros are champion cheerleaders, but soon after being named captain, Torrance discovers that their team has actually been stealing cheers from a poor, inner-city school. Poor 'Tor' is torn. She wants her team to win, but will she be able to do it without cheating? The plot isn't a bad idea, really. It's just your basic sports movie (although there is debate about whether cheering is a sport.) However, the aspect that really brings the movie down is the seriousness that is laid on extra thick in nearly every scene. For example, when trying to convince a skeptical newcomer to join the team, Torrance says with a cheesy grin, 'We work hard, we have fun, and we win national championships.' She sounds like an infomercial for the Wonderful World of Cheering. To make matters even more confusing, the ultra-seriousness is alternated with jokes and situations that blatantly make fun of cheering and reinforce the blond, bimbo cheerleader stereotype. I really can't figure out if they're trying to make cheerleading the hero or the butt of the jokes. Plus, Kirstin Dunst was so annoying as the self-centered, cheering obsessed, PMSing Torrance that I really don't think I'll voluntarily see another one of her movies for quite some time.",1,4,10,28 January 2002
