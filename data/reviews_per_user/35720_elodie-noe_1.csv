The Monuments Men," The monument men
","The last film I have seen is called The monument men. This film has been directed by George Clooney and he is also the main character, Frank Stokes. There are many good actors in the cast like Matt Damon, Jean Dujardin, Cate Blanchett and Bill Murray.It is a historical film which take place in 1944 during the World War II. The film is about a group of American soldier have to go to Europe to take back art to their owners. Their nickname is 'the monument men'. During the war, the Nazis took away work of art to create their own museum. Frank Stokes and all his team will look after them to save the culture. However, it will not be without men loss.I absolutely loved this film because it is really different from World War II films i am used to see. The film shows another part of this war that I didn't know. The story takes place mainly in France and Belgium, so I fell closer to this story because it is a part of our history. All the cast is made by dazzling actors and most of them have already won an Oscar or have already been nominated. That contribute to the success of this film. I would strongly recommend this film to everyone because it shows us another image of the war that we didn't really know.",8,1,1,28 October 2014
