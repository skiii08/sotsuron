Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Star Wars film that's dull?
","I'm not going to go off on a rant about Jar Jar. OK, he's an annoying character, but Lucas seems fairly comfortable with that fact.No, the thing that surprised me was just how bored I was with the film. Beyond a few fight scenes featuring Qui Gon Jinn and Kenobi fighting federation robots, I can't really recall anything to set the pulse racing.Oh, I forgot. The Pod Race. Somehow I have this image of George Lucas popping over to his Lucasarts Games division and asking 'What's a really popular genre of computer games we haven't yet tried?'. I tend to view that sequence as the worlds most expensive video game commercial.This, coupled with the lack of a decent enemy (what does Darth Maul DO?), makes for a very unsatisfying movie. In fact, halfway through I actually caught myself looking at my watch. I haven't done that in a film for a long time.",5,0,1,1 August 1999
Madagascar," Dreamworks reputation diminishing...
","What a lot of publicity this film received. For what seems like months, my daughter and I have been bombarded with Madagascar TV promotions, food promotions, toy adverts and all the usual hoopla associated with a major kids animated movie release. In a way it's similar to the periodic population explosion which is responsible for the lemming suicide myth. Every now and then, the lemming population becomes so large that they migrate en masse, causing some to die as they flock over a cliff. In this case, the media have waiting too long since Dreamworks last animated epic, the disappointing Shark Tale, so with another 2 years to wait for the next Shrek sequel, they have whipped themselves up into a frenzy over Madagascar. But does it deserve the attention?In a word, no. Like Shark Tale, Madagascar doesn't really cut it as a winner. A lack of decent jokes is the main reason why the film fails to grab the attention in the way it should. There are some funny moments involving a trio of cunning penguins who have their own escape plan, as well as some good toilet humour, but the laughs are few and far between. After a while the film develops a vegetarian motif, as Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller) starts to return to his wild instincts and craves zebra meat. This is fairly uncomfortable viewing (though this may be for my own personal reasons), as is the heavy-handed patriotism which seems to inflict many films that centre around New York. David Schwimmer's neurotic giraffe is left to provide most of the comic relief, while Jada Pinkett Smith's hippopotamus might as well not be there. There was something odd about the animation which I couldn't quite place, too. It seemed to be too jerky, with characters hopping about so quickly that it was hard to watch.Madagascar might have the big names and the big studio behind it, but my young daughter wasn't hooked and nor was I.",5,0,1,29 July 2005
Corpse Bride," A slightly stiff movie
","Tim Burton's previous big animation offering, The Nightmare before Christmas, was a pleasant enough offering. I never really fell for it as much as some of his devotees did, but I enjoyed its gloomy charm and the songs were fun. I was expecting more of the same sort of thing with Corspe Bride, and it seems that I wasn't far off.The story is about a young man, the son of a wealthy fishmonger, who is due to marry the daughter of an aristocratic, but poor, family. The wedding rehearsals are a disaster and, one thing leading to another as they often do in films, the poor chap ends up being married to a corpse. I know, it doesn't seem to make sense, but it does at the time, trust me. So, instead of spending his honeymoon relaxing with his new bride, planning their future together (and, presumably, trying to remove the smell of fish from the rental tuxedo), he is instead dragged into the netherworld. With hilarious consequences.Except there aren't really any hilarious consequences at all. To be honest, it felt a little (if you pardon the pun) lifeless. Johnny Depp is fine, not to mention barely recognisable, as the English-accented groom, Victor. Helena Bohnam-Carter (who assures us she had to audition for her husband, Tim Burton. Yeah right) is perfectly acceptable as the zombie newlywed. But, weird premise aside, the film is a bit predictable. There are some nice songs (though not up to Nightmare Before Christmas standards) and some decent jokes involving body parts and decomposition, but the story pretty much follows the path you might expect from a standard 'I married a dead chick' movie.Wait for video.",5,2,6,19 November 2005
Pitch Black," Last one out turn off the lights
","I watched this because I wanted to watch The Chronicles Of Riddick and I thought it best to understand some back story. I wish I hadn't bothered.The odd thing is, a lot of people really like this movie. They think it's a low-key, suspense-filled sci-fi classic, in the mold of Alien. They're idiots, mind you. This is just dull.The idea is that a ship crash lands on a strange planet, killing most of the crew. Among the survivors is Riddick, a murderer being transported back to justice. The planet in question has a strange arrangement of suns, such that there is perpetual daylight. The place is a constant desert. The survivors discover a ruined settlement where the previous inhabitants were all eaten. It seems there are aliens that live in the dark beneath the surface of the planet. And that's when the eclipse comes...What follows is a story where the small band of scared humans tries to harness what little light they can while trying to repair a small spaceship to get them off the planet. And what about Riddick? Is he friend or foe? Well, I'll tell you what he's not: a very good actor. Vin Diesel grunts and rasps his way through this film with little or no effort at all. Sometimes he does a sort of evil chuckle which is really quite rubbish. And, for a film called Pitch Black, there is really quite a lot of light about, despite the supposed eclipse. While frantic extras are trying to huddle around a small flame from a Jack Daniels bottle, there's loads of light illuminating the hills behind them. Where's all that coming from?Unscary CGI aliens, identikit cannon-fodder humans, poor one-liners. This is the sort of action movie I thought we had left behind. All of which makes the prospect of the Chronicles of Riddick even less tempting.5 out of 10",5,1,3,20 November 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Pointless sequel of a sci-fi classic
","I love Terminator 2, possibly even more than the original. I admire the way it skillfully creates the idea of the unstoppable machine (the liquid-metal T-1000) mindlessly and tirelessly on the trail of our heroes. The action scenes are world class and the effects, revolutionary in their day, are still pretty impressive. There are some pretty big faults, demonstrated by the poor attempts at humour and personified in the role of John Connor (Edward Furlong), but as a piece of movie making it is a good benchmark. Much of T2 involves the characters trying to avert a war against intelligent machines, which is due to start in 1997. I'm sure I won't be giving away too much when I say that they succeed in preventing the war. The end.So, why a third installment? Well, the rules of Hollywood accountancy dictate that, since T2 made so much money and since Arnie didn't object, even averted wars can get started up again.In T3 we meet up with John Connor again, now in his 20's and living 'off the grid'. It seems he didn't trust that the machine threat was completely gone, so he is drifting around, using assumed names and doing his best not to appear in any databases. So when the inevitable happens and a new terminator is sent to kill him (along with a now-obligatory 'friendly' terminator to protect him) its first mission is to track down and kill all the people who <strong>will</strong> help him in the future. His future lieutenants, as it were. In doing this, the new Terminator stumbles on John's trail and the chase begins.This is not a James Cameron film (the other two were, and so was the 3D short which you can only see at Universal Studios) but he did contribute to the script. I wonder how much input he really had though, because it definitely lacks the Cameron sheen you expect from his own projects. It's just not as tight.The new terminator is a female robot, with some of the abilities of the previous liquid killer but the new twist is that this one can form itself into a variety of high-powered weapons. Whereas Robert Patrick's T-1000 was limited to shaping himself into knives and sharp spikes in order to kill the Connors, the new T-X can whip out a souped-up plasma rifle which could blast a rhino in half. So, all the powers of the last one, plus some extra makes for a much more interesting character, right?Not really. The T-X is not as engaging as the T-1000. Robert Patrick's character had oodles more menace than pretty girl Kristanna Loken. I remember being shocked the first time I saw bullets splat big holes in his liquid body, then watched the holes mysteriously close. The same thing happens again here, but it's a case of 'yeah, we had that 13 years ago. What's new?'Well, there's the certificate for starters. T2 was a 15, this is a 12. There's more humour too, unfortunately. Too often the movie tries to get laughs from Arnie's grim cyborg saying lines you wouldn't expect from a killing-machine. Like 'talk to the hand'. Har-bloody-har. Again, we had that 13 years ago and it was cack even then.There is a nice destructive car chase and the action is well paced, but in the end it all seems rather pointless. Our only hope is that Arnie becomes so embroiled in politics that he can't find the time for another one.I'll give it 5 out of 10.",Null,0,0,28 September 2004
Liar Liar," Dire Dire
","I hate this film with a passion. Not only does it feature the child-with-the-stupidest-haircut-EVER, it serves as nothing more than a showcase for Carrey's tedious gurning. It's remarkably predictable, which would be excusable if you could be sure that what was coming would make you laugh. As it is, watching the film is like waiting for the dentist. You know that, sooner or later, Jim is going to start yelling and pulling another 'hilarious' face. Take my advice. Ask for the anaesthetic.",2,6,20,10 March 2001
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," It's just one note. Anyone could have written that.
","Cards on the table: I'm a bit of a Tenacious D fan. I have the album and I loved the series of TV shorts. If you don't know who they are, Tenacious D (or just 'the D') is the rock band which comprises Jack Black and his buddy Kyle Gass. In the TV show, as in this movie, they are not playing themselves but two characters with the same names. The screen versions of JB and KG are wannabe rock musicians whose sense of self-worth vastly outweighs their actual talent. This film tells the story of their meeting and the formation of the band, as well as their quest for the fabled 'pick of destiny', a magical plectrum which grants the possessor the abilities of a rock legend.Many will be familiar with Jack Black from his role in The School Of Rock, and there are similarities here. School of Rock was almost a watered-down version of Tenacious D, with the language toned down for a younger audience. In Pick Of Destiny, both Black and Gass 'let the F-bombs fly' and the result is mostly successful. The characters are amusing and the movie is stylishly presented, but I found myself wanting more.Tenacious D are most amusing when they're actually performing. For too long in this movie, they are simply a couple of fat blokes in an apartment, arguing. I would have preferred more songs and less banter. I would even have been happy for them to reprise some of the songs from the album, but as it stands the movie takes too long to get going and the real funny moments are too far apart. There are cameos by Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller, but these rely too much on silly wigs to add much to the proceedings.I found myself wondering whether the concept of Tenacious D was enough to support a whole movie, but consider this: if Bill and Ted had enough mileage for two successful films, The D should have been able to fill one.",6,0,0,12 February 2007
Cube," A neat concept is not enough!
","Yeah, this is a clever idea for a film, and I applaud the makers' ingenuity regarding the set.But the dialogue is appalling! Each of the characters is a one-trick pony, from the wild-eyed 'I modeled him on Sisko' egomaniac cop to the predictably-intelligent 'Hoffman may sue' mentally handicapped bloke.Sure, it would get an A at film school, but I'd rather see a film with real actors, not volunteers from Burger King.",4,2,5,30 May 2000
