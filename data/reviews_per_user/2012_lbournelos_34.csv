The Rock," Just one question
",What is this completely untalented man doing between actors. The only satisfying scenes were those with him locked in his last name.,8,0,2,2 March 2020
The Lobster," Insulting crime
","When a film starts with in-cold-blood assassination of a donkey, you must do your best to put the alleged 'co-writer and director' far away from any human society. If you can't do it, at least do not waste your time to see this junk.",1,1,5,23 February 2019
The Sound of Music," One of the easiest ratings
","Behaving like a witch mother-in-law watching movies, I always try to find a flaw, a mistake, a mishap.
This film is perfect in any possible way you look at it.
Apart from that it is one of the strongest protests against ANY kind, ANY color, ANY time of fascism in the world.
I remain deeply obliged to the whole team of this film, from director to the stage cleaner.
THANK YOU!",10,0,0,13 January 2020
Finding Neverland," Masterpiece!
","Johnny Depp is not one of my favorites. In this film he was superb. The same stands for magic Freddie Highmore - 'Peter', Lady Julie Christie and Kelly McDonald - 'Peter Pan'. It doesn't mean that the rest of the cast was not good, just the afore mentioned were in a class of their own.
Congratulations also to the director, scenario and special effects.
The film was touching in every way. Thanks.",10,1,2,29 October 2019
Training Day," As my first comment was considered inappropriate I need to edit it.
","If this is an Oscar winner, I'd prefer anything that was rejected by the Academy. I found this movie extremely and unreasonably violent, rude and insulting for the American police, to say the least. I also didn't like the acting and the dialogs consisted mainly on one 'bad' word, repeated continuously.",1,1,8,15 January 2019
Bloody Sunday," Lost opportunity
","Stable hands is what a camera operator MUST have, being selected/approved or ordered by the director.
I believe that the later MUST go back to primary school of directors.
Mr Greengrass had a diamond in hand and turn it to coal, obsessed by 'documentary' film theory.
Therefore, instead of taking advantage to make the world understand what the 'Empire' did to Earth (and not only Northen Ireland) made a film hard to see.
If I was to rate direction only, '1' would be the highest I would give.",6,0,0,10 February 2020
Aquaman," once upon a time
","Movies were filmed in location, rarely in studios, with human actresses and actors. Nowadays o hungry, ridiculous paid, Indian, in a semi-submersed basement flat, using an outdated intel i3 PC, produces a huge number of '- men', 'super- hero' films. The producers pay NOTHING, there are no actresses or actors, nor technicians, nor bests boys, no humans at all, but the humanoid apes push themselves to gain a prime seat in the hall, so they can boast that they saw the 'masterpiece' first! IMDb should have established absolute zero (-273) for these 'things'. Thank God I have seen (to give you a hint) 'Rebecca', and similar masterpieces, and , as you may guess I quite old, therefore I am extremely demanding from 'modern art'. Rubbish IS NOT ART!!!",1,5,11,22 December 2018
Youth," Filmed in 2015?
","Out of trend, a nice gentle film. Doesn't belong here!",9,2,3,23 June 2019
Empire of the Sun," Masterpiece.
",Lots of words mean poverty. Masterpiece. One word is enough.,10,1,2,22 May 2019
LÃ©on: The Professional," The perfect recipe
","Dosage: One good scenario with clever script, one inspired European director (Luc Besson), one non jeune-premier leading role actor (Jean Reno), one blooming and promising young female actress in the best - by far- role of her career (Natalie Portman), two (at least) prime role actors (Danny Aiello and Gary Oldman), perfect positioning and angle of camera, ideal balance between reality, sense and imagination, to mention some of the parts of perfection.
I'm easy, if I 'm satisfied, to give a 9/10, but having spent decades behind cameras 10/10 is given only to 6 movies, since 1927 (Metropolis).",10,2,2,6 July 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Oh my God! A tribute to Stanislavsky Konstantin.
","I bet my everything, Mr. Rami Malek, spit a thousand gallons of blood in his effort to PERFORM Freddy Mercury. Hats off to Mr. Bryan Singer too, for his unique success to balance on a thin fragile line getting through. Being older from all the (live and dead) members of the band, I feel obliged to confess that I love this band. But, BUT, being well educated to movie making, I suggest this film as a lesson of film making to any aspiring actor or director, not ignoring all the people whose contribution made the effort feasible. This is the third (or, maybe, the forth) time, I wish I could rate 50/10! BRAVO!!!",9,3,4,8 February 2019
No Country for Old Men," Misleaded by rating
","One of the worse films ever. Extremely overrated, for no story, no plot, no acting, no sense, no ending. On top of that I wonder who told Bardem that he is an actor. As for Coen brothers I 'll never watch one of their crimes.",1,7,16,26 October 2018
The Number 23," Please expand the scale to -273!
","The only cure to this kind of crimes must be an extremely long and painful execution.
What a pity for Ms Madsen to stand aside this creature, which, according to the filming industry is human.",1,0,0,6 July 2020
The Lives of Others," Masterpiece
","I had no idea about this film until it was proposed to me by a friend.
To be honest I was not very sure that a German film dealing with DDR/Stasi would be exciting and I was wrong.",9,0,0,5 February 2020
Mulholland Drive," 1/10 as there is no -273 rating
","Although I promised to myself, after suffering 'Lost Highway', that I will never even touch the cover of a David Lynch film, I didn't kept my promise.
The question is not who told Lynch that he can write and direct, the question is who is putting his money on production like this.
Take a look at the Box Office details of his 'crimes' and you will understand what I mean.",1,3,8,6 March 2020
Jurassic World," Einstein said once:
","'Universe and human stupidity are limitless. I'm not sure about Universe'.
This junk is one (of indefinite number of) proof(s) of Einstein's position on human stupidity. If there could be -273/10 as rate, that would be mine! Although absolute zero is a huge compliment to 'that'!",Null,1,2,27 June 2019
The Hangover Part II," There is no -273 rate
","Instead of putting into jail EVERYONE involved, in any way, with the first crime, civilization had to suffer, not only one but two (for the time being) sequels.
On the other hand as these mammals declare actors, directors, whatever, and a lot of mammals accept it, I am intrigued by the idea of declaring myself as master of universal knowledge genius!
Gather near me, followers!",Null,0,3,28 January 2020
Quiz Show," Straight 10
","I must admit that the idea was borrowed (stolen) from the 'Network' and also, no film can be released to public without NBC's etc. approval.
Simply the entertainment and mass media dominators thought that such a film would give a 'forgiveness to their 'business'.
Apart from the above, technically, literally, artistically and plot wise the film was excellent.",10,0,1,13 August 2019
Singin' in the Rain," Extremely impressive but quite outdated
","Direction is excellent, music and dancing is perfect, decoration and effects are impressive.
Also historically it gives a full picture of the era of the transmission from 'silent' to 'talkie'.
But judging it in total, that was a film to be a record breaker THEN (1952).
Today it is quite outdated and in some scenes too lengthy, almost boring.",7,0,0,17 January 2020
There's Something About Mary," Could be a 7
","If the humanoid ben stiller was put in an Edwardian school of actors for 2.381 years, so this 'thing' would obtain the proper skills to clean the assistant personnel toilets of the studio, then the rate would be, easily 7, maybe 8.",4,2,4,9 January 2020
Pretty Woman," Hector Elizondo is the star
","Romantic film, nice music, interesting plot, fine beautiful actress, (Mrs. Roberts) and handsome actor, (Mr. Gere) in prime roles, a success story from the very beginning. But, although I am enjoying movies like that, I would never rate this one as 9. The difference (and the extra points) is made by the secondary role actor Mr. Elizondo! I saw him, for the first time, in a rather extreme and rather stupid drama/comedy 'Young doctors in love' (1982) and I was impressed by his acting performance. In 'Pretty woman' he is the absolute star. The script supported his role, of course, but the talent is indisputable.",9,8,9,27 December 2018
The Departed," Follower to two 'nothings'
","No objection to the genius director, able to take a rubbish and turn it to a masterpiece.
My objection is against the production, putting the name of an exceptionally excellent actor, Mr. Nicholson, AFTER two 'nothings' just because the 'marketing analysts' said so.
1000 to Scorsese and Nicholson -273 to the production and marketing.",Null,0,2,8 February 2020
The Holiday," The absolute criterion
","For a movie is the expression in your face at the end. I was smiling. Widely. I spent a couple of hours enjoying a nice story, good scenario and excellent acting. I feel obliged to underline the extreme pleasure I sensed seen Eli Wallach. I met him first as Tuco in The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, having seen all his films, since. He was the cherry on the cake, in this movie, as usual! He is playing for the big guy, upstairs, since 2014!!!",9,0,0,15 January 2019
Love Actually," A straight rival to 'What a wonderful life'!
","What a happy, enjoyable and entertaining movie! Really a perfect mixture of tears and smiles, a huge injection of happiness, in these dark days of filming shock and awe, destruction of planets and floods of blood. Clever scenario, an impressive number of prime actors (also in secondary roles), smart dialogues, sense and feelings and nice music too. One of the few happiest movies I have ever seen. My compliments to all (they are really too many) participants! Bravo!",9,0,2,26 December 2018
12 Years a Slave," Find him another job.
","My only question is who picked this man to 'act' in the leading role.
His face didn't change at all during the whole film with the exception of a couple of tears added in his lower eyelids by the make-up assistant, in two or three scenes.
The worst by far 'acting' I have ever seen.
P.S. THIS won 3 Oscars. Today in Trump's environment it wouldn't be even nominee!",1,0,1,6 May 2020
To Kill a Mockingbird," Foreigner
","Being such, racism mainly, as long as other issues/trend/habits, like guns everywhere, acceptance of self justice, drinking as entertainment I fail to understand a lot of meanings in such movies. Having quite an experience on the subject, I'd say it has an excellent directing, good scenario, superb acting, specially from the adorable 'Scout' (sorry, Gregory Peck) and almost perfect photography. Generally speaking for a country with no national core (although 'nation' is repeatedly used in USA, where the citizens form a unique patchwork of nationalities) for a non US citizen, some things and ideas are not easy to understand. And I dare to say that 3 Academy Awards were a comfortable 'forgiveness' to the unspeakable racism, even today, in US. I do not mean to insult anyone, but on the other hand, I can not ignore one, maybe the most critical trend on the 'civilized' world, racism, and spot it whenever recognized. Scratching my head, I think 'In the heat of the night' was a louder and more positive voice against racism. Anyway, it's just an (my) opinion!",8,0,2,14 July 2019
The Reader," Masterpiece
",I believe that any more words about this film sound as an insult. MASTERPIECE.,10,1,1,14 April 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Some acts must be considered as crimes.
","Remake what? A 1974 masterpiece in every respect! I wonder whose mind crossed the idea of such a remake. A director who can hardly act (he 'acts', too!!!) against Sidney Lumet and a cast of amateurs against epic actors.
If Hollywood has run out of ideas, close the shop, instead of insulting audiences.",1,5,9,19 April 2020
Saving Mr. Banks," Maybe the easiest 10/10
","I 'll start with a confession.
Having seen not all, but quite a number of Tom Hanks films, I was considering him as 'below average actor'. Specially 'Saving private Ryan (1998)' I gave it a 4/10, just for the first 20 minutes of it. If I was to judge Tom Hanks 1/10 would be tooooo much for me!.
Having really enjoyed any second of 'Saving (again - but this time) Mr. Banks', I must say 'Mr. Tom Hanks I am grateful for proving me ignorant, shortsighted, stupid', to say the least.
Thank you for making me laugh and cry beyond control!On the other side stands Miss Emma Thompson.
I always adored her and she was, once again, a spectacle!
By the way, is she married???A film, specially such a film, is not an one woman/man show.
I wish to thank the whole team, but, allow me, an extra 'bravo' to Mr. Paul Giamatti.I wish I will see more masterpieces like this.
Thanks again!",10,0,1,2 May 2020
The Sixth Sense," Disadvandages of a superb film with smart and unexpected plot
","1. Armenian director and writer
2. Absence of the magic word 'American' from the title.
Certainly 'American Beauty' was an excellent film, but compared to '6th sense' it is of lesser value.
Mr. Shyamalan and Mr. Haley Joel Osmend should have taken the academy awards",9,1,1,7 January 2020
RED," Nicely balanced and entairtaining
","Action - Drama - Comedy. Eating nails - Moved - Laughing with my heart.
Very good directing, unique actors team, clever scenario. What else someone wishes? The film was unknown to me and, thanks to my son I enjoyed it from start to end.",9,0,0,5 February 2020
A Walk to Remember," We need such films
","We need to remember simple life joys and every day stories, specially in a time when '-men' were bombing audiences with violence and hate. Apart from the sad end I realized that there was a smile in my face at finish.",8,0,0,23 October 2018
Me Before You," Who's that girl?
","My daughter is the most beautiful girl in the world. The BEST second choice is Miss Emilia Clarke (same age)!
What a wonderful girl is she.!
What an excellent and charming actress is she!
You may say 'English movie' and it says it all.
A thousand thanks to all the participants of this film for the extreme pleasance and enjoyment you offered to me.
And I swear I'll not miss a film of Miss Magic Emilia Clarke.
God proves his presence in many strange ways!",10,3,5,14 August 2019
