Alien 3," Some observations about the scenery
","In general it is a quite good movie but I recognized some problems in the scenery. 1: the cryo-capsules differ from the ones in the Aliens, although, they are (or should be) the very same - I see no logic in changing them. 2: the wrecked escape pod seems to be in a better and better condition throughout the film while nobody seems to have made any repairs and even the body-scanner becomes usable, while in the beginning of the story the whole interior was a wrecked mess. Is it intentional or just a big folly?",10,1,6,14 September 2000
