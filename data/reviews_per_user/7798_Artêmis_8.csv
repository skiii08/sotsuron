The Blair Witch Project," The biggest disappointment I had in my life
","First of all, WARNING SOME SPOILERS IN THE COMMENTThe Blair Witch Project is for sure the stupidest movie I've seen in my life. I had listened and read a lot of good things and opinions about it and I was expecting something incredible and terrifying but what I found was one film less frightening than the Team Rocket in Pok√©mon, the purple Teletubbie and Dr. Evil in Austin Powers.I simply didn't fell scared in any moment. It's so silly. Only stupid Americans that believed this documentary was real liked it. It sucks!The unique moment I felt pleasure in watching this was when someone in the theatre, tired of Heather's screams (as all the audience), shouted 'SHUT UP'. Everybody laughed. After it, all the people (more than 150) in the theatre hooted when the credits appeared.I really can't believe how someone felt scared in this piece of c**p. It's boring and nothing happens. During the day they only walked and walked and during the night they had to turn off the camera for the witch not to know where they were.I really think that the problem is that there are very much stupid and ingenuous people in USA. How can someone believe all this was true? That's the only chance to like it. As all the people around the world know it's a silly and not creative story, I think The Blair Witch Project's average rating will fall. The worst is that as they wanted American people to believe in the story, they made everything so real that the movie got boring. And they never show the witch or killer or murderer, so the documentary looks really real. If you are supertitious, you can think that there's a witch in the forest. If you are not, it's possible for you to think that a crazy murderer is killing everybody. So all American people were able to believe in the documentary. How smart they are!I'm until not sure about my vote. I wanted to give it 1, but I'm thinking about 2. The end of the movie is a bit interesting and unusual although many people think the end is the worst part, it's the only bit I liked!In summary it's a horrible, silly, boring, slow and childish movie. And who said it's the best horror movie ever made should be arrested for offending Hitchcock and even Wes Craven!",1,0,1,2 October 1999
Children of Heaven," One simple story that render a good drama
","The story of Children of Heaven can look fool and too simple to be a good one. But it's really good! Majid Majidi did a film about one poor family where the little son (Ali) lost his sister's shoes. As the family is very poor, Ali tries to keep it as a secret with his sister and doing this he would save his father from paying for new ones. In fact he was afraid of being beaten by his father too.
During almost one hour they show the pranks of the child. This part is very funny. Some scenes show Zarah (the sister) looking at other girls' shoes and then being shamefaced because his brother's were very large in her feet. One that is very beauty is when they are cleaning the shoes and they start to play with the bubbles. Then Ali discover that there will be a challenge where the third prize would be shoes. So, he enter in the challenge to get the third position. As many other Iranian films it's a little bit slow and not audacious. But the best is that it show us Iran as it is and not as the USA want us to believe. Everybody know that they do a lot of things with the woman because of the religion but it's not so exaggerated as American films show. If you see 'Not without my daughter', an American film, you may think Iran is the poorest, ugliest and worst place to live in the world. But when you see Children of Heaven you only think that they live in a different culture, in different ways. Now that I saw it I only think that Iran is a country as many other. The unique difference is that woman have to hide their hair. Only this. (Extreme generalization!)Watching Children of Heaven is a good and different experience. It's a delicate and ingenuous movie but it's touching in the same way.",8,8,10,29 September 1999
Notting Hill," Why is Notting Hill so special?
","If you ask me why I've given 10 for Notting Hill I'll not be able explain. Is Notting Hill a masterpiece? No, for sure no. Is Notting Hill genial? No. Is Notting Hill a different style of romantic-comedy? No. New style? No. But even thinking that Notting Hill is only another romantic-comedy, I've given it a 10. And there are some movies that I've given 9 that are better than Notting Hill...!Well, I think that the 'problem' is that you don't see anything bad in it, it's very hard to find something that could make you give a lower rate to this movie. First of all, the cast is great. Julia Roberts is in her best performance, Hugh Grant is very nice and Emma Chambers and Rhys Ifans are VERY funny. The screenplay is good too, and romantic (I love romance). But in fact, I think that the 'problem' is that Notting Hill is English! Before watching it, I was thinking: 'My God! Another American romantic-comedy with Julia Roberts. I've already watched My Best Friend Wedding and I don't want to watch the same style of story again and again'. But when I discovered that NH is an English movie I started to think about it in a different way. I love English movies! But that's unfair. No, that's not the 'problem' too.
In fact, what I think is that Notting Hill is one fun, relaxing and beauty movie that you watch and stop thinking about your problems. While you're watching it you forget everything and pay attention only in the story. You know, it's very hard to happen in movies nowadays, make the spectator pay attention. When the movie ends, you want to give it a 10, it's like magic. In summary, NH is the kind of movie which you say: Watch it and have fun!",10,0,1,2 November 1999
Armageddon," One asteroid in our patience
","I decided to watch Armaggedon after seeing the music in the TV and after my friends told me this movie was good (remark: my friends are teenagers with anything in their heads). So, I went with my sister to watch it. I was expecting one beautiful movie where the people, knowing that the world would end, tried to use their last minutes as good as they could.  You know, one movie that could make we cry. But no! All the movie is centralized in the 'astronauts', all silly and rude man. It's interesting that knowing that the world would end in some days, all were very happy, and funny, and doing jokes one with the other. Even one scene that looks romantic (in the tv clip, without sound), when Ben Affleck is in one farm with Liv Tyler, is ridiculous. They are in the lawn and Ben start to talk, with a biscuit in his hands: 'I really don't think that the animal cracker qualifies as a cracker.' Liv asks why and he answers: 'Well cause it's sweet, which to me suggests cookie, I mean well putting cheese on something is sort of a defining characteristic of what makes a cracker a cracker. I don't know why I thought of that, i just-'. Isn't that ridiculous? Yes, but that was the most intelligent scene in all the movie. If you like special effects, don't watch this movie, they appear only in 5 minutes. Sci-fi? No, Armaggedon is really, believe me, a comedy. But if you like comedy... Don't go to. Why? During one hour they stay in the asteroid trying to destroy it. And I almost slept! In fact, don't waste your money in this film. It's really horrible. I'm sure there's something better to do! (Maybe sleep). 2 ---------------- 10",2,0,2,28 August 1999
Toy Story 2," Beautiful and fun but...
","I really liked Toy Story 2. It is very good, watching it is fun for all ages and it's in my opinion the most beautiful movie ever made by Disney. Everything is very colorful and the toys are so perfect that they look real (although the humans are still strange). And it's not interrupted in each 15 minutes for a nonsense musical play like almost all other Disney's movies do! And the references to Star Wars are hilarious. But even being almost perfect, I can't give TY 2 a 10. I said it was the most beautiful film but not the most touching. I watched the whole movie smiling, laughing sometimes and having fun but it's impossible to fell something, to fell sorry or cry because Woody will go to a Japanese Museum, or because Jessie is living in a dark box. They're toys! And worse, made by computers! It's very hard to enjoy the scenes that should be touching. No, you enjoy those scenes, like them, but not because you're sorry but because everything is majestic, every single detail is perfect. In fact, it's hard to LOVE them. Here, at IMDb you can see how people are exaggerating. TY2 is great but it's not the 16th best movie of all the times. Of course Toy Story's secret is that it was enjoyable for all ages and almost impossible to hate. Look at me, I really thing it doesn't deserve this but I'm giving it an 8 or 9 and, in fact, I'm helping this siyuation to continue.   Well, it's not so hard to give it a 10 but when I look at my 10-movies I can't even compare them to Toy Story 2. TY will never be better or even similar to movies as Election, Go, Pleasantville, The Sixth Sense, Hilary and Jackie, Valmont, Deconstructing Harry, All about My Mother, Mallrats, Clerks, Shakespeare in Love, Cruel Intentions, Next Stop Wonderland.... God, look at Eyes Wide Shut: a great movie, 10/10 but as it's 'hate-able', received a lot of 1s. And others amazing movies as Dogma are almost out of the Top 250 because of this 'exaggeration'.For non-USA viewers, I would recommend to see TY2 with captions not with 'voices from your country'. This way you'll enjoy a lot more as Disney spends a lot of money in voices, songs and sound effects what may not happen when it's being translated. And it's fun to see some famous voices as Tom Hanks' in Woody. So, enjoy TY2, love it but don't expect one of the best movies of the history.",8,0,1,21 December 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," One of the best movies ever made. Masterpiece.
","I wouldn't say that 'Eyes Wide Shut' is perfect but it is at least 99,9% perfect. First of all, if you want to enjoy it, relax and try not to compare it to other Kubrick's movies because each one of them are completely different from others. I heard so many people saying that EWS was great but as it was from Kubrick, they're expecting more. I think it's unfair. Well, writing about EWS isn't easy because it deserves some reflection after watching. For me it's even harder as I'm not writing in my natural language but in English so, the only way I found to do this review was to comment each point of the movie particularly. The director: Stanley Kubrick is great. In fact EWS was my first Stanley's movie and that's another reason for me to wait sometime before writing this review.  I wanted to rent other Kubrick's movie to see if he was really the genius that all the magazines and newspapers were saying. I rented 'A Clockwork Orange' and he's in fact, one of the best directors of the cinema history. And if you look at his filmography you can see how amazing he is. Some dramas as EWS, a science fiction (2001 - A Space Odyssey), a suspense-horror (The Shining), a war movie... And most of them are known as their category's best. Kubrick knew how to make us pay attention in the movie, stay tuned every minute, enjoy each scene. The 3 hours of EWS passed so fast for me and I wanted more and more. Kubrick is really a genius.The cast: the entire cast was great. Tom Cruise is for sure a good actor and Nicole Kidman finally used all her talent. Some people said that Nicole was not a good choice because she had always worked in bad movies but most of the actors and actresses don't start acting directly in good movies. There's always a first time. And Nicole is very excellent. One good surprise is the young Leelee Sobieski. Even appearing less than 3 minutes in the whole movie, she was amazing. She didn't need to say one word, looking at her face you knew what she was doing, thinking, that she was enjoying being used by her father... (Today, she had been nominated in the Golden Globes for her great performance in 'Joan of Arc')
The soundtrack: I can't imagine different songs in Eye Wide Shut. They've used the best. Who is able to forget the amazing 'Musica Ricercata', that played during the end of the 'climax scene', the orgy? And the romantic 'When I Fall In Love'? EWS's should win next year's Academy Awards (today, it had been nominated for the Golden Globes!). The cinematography, art-direction, costume design and set decoration: great too! The clothes, sceneries, furniture, and the cinematography of EWS are just great. And they got even better mixed with the music. The best example is the famous orgy scene again: the music is tense and strong, the clothes (not very much, but there are) and masks are strange and mysterious, almost all the furniture, walls and clothes were yellow or black. Even the voices were strange! Perfect. The orgy scene will be forever in the cinema history. Polemical and provocative.The screenplay: the complex screenplay is the movie and each person has a different view about what Kubrick wanted to say and about the symbolism that is in EWS. What Stanley really wanted to say? What were his intentions? There are many different opinions and I'm not sure if mine is the best. In fact, there isn't one best interpretation. What I know for sure is that EWS is a amazing movie, from the best director of the world and not watching it is a sin. FOR SURE.And surely, 10/10",10,1,2,20 December 1999
The Green Mile," I confess: it's a great movie
","Surprised. That's how I was feeling after seeing 'The Green Mile'. I've never expected anything from this movie, in fact, before watching, I used to think that it would be boring, exaggerated, silly, annoying, irritant, ugly and an unjustifiable nominee for the Oscar, occupying space that should be used by much better movies. Most of these 'qualities' were deduced from the scenes that were always shown in the television: the little mouse running, the little mouse eating, the little mouse that... like the whole film was about the mouse. And more than this, by some extremely exaggerated ones, where the 2 meters Michael Clarke Duncan asked Tom Hanks to leave the lights on in the night. I knew that the movie wouldn't be so stupid, of course. It was nominated for the Oscar for some good reason. So, I wanted to take a look at it. After watching 'The Talented Mr. Ripley', 'The Cider House Rules', 'American Beauty' and 'Being John Malkovich', it was 'The Green Mile' time. I went to the cheaper theater in my town and... surprise! After less than 30 minutes I was completely interested and excited. Although the mouse really appeared a lot in story, it wasn't as irritant as I thought it would be. In fact, the little mouse was very important in some of the main and most emotional scenes. The movie would be worse without it. I thought Michael Clarke Duncan was good in his role but not amazing. Tom Hanks was. The cinematography was beautiful and the execution scenes were remarkable. And the three hours and eight minutes passed very fast.
I still think that 'Eyes Wide Shut', 'Magnolia', 'Being John Malkovich', 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' and even 'Election' deserved the Best Picture nomination (much) more than 'The Green Mile'. But now, at least, I'm not so indignant. 'The Green Mile' has its qualities, and these aren't a few. 9/10",9,0,0,11 March 2000
The Truman Show," Jim Carrey in a drama! And it's good!
","The Truman Show is one of my favorite movies. Before watching it I wasn't very excited even expecting a great film. In fact, I decided to watch it when I realized that all magazines were saying it was incredible, beautiful, touching, ... And I really found it!I thought the movie was more comedy than drama. It's a multi-genre movie, it's very hard to tell. I loved the scenes where they showed  how Truman's life could be (and were) controlled. One spotlight falling from the sky, all the days were sunny, the same people doing the same thing every day, and the most amazing, when Christof (Ed Harris), trying to find Truman, makes the sun rise in 2 seconds at midnight. I have to say that I was a bit afraid of Jim Carrey. How can a movie with Jim Carrey as the main character be a drama or even be good? But this time his grimaces didn't affect the movie. As nothing is perfect in the world, there are some small 'problems' in The Truman Show. I think the theme could be more explored by the director Peter Weir. The end, that some people said was revolting, didn't look so strange to me but I agree that they should have shown what happened to Truman after his decision. OK, Truman is free. And after it? In summary, you must see this movie. It's almost perfect. 9/10",9,0,0,14 October 1999
