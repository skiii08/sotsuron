Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great action movie....worth seeing again.
","Only thing on this morn', so I watched it for maybe the third time. It is still one of the best action flicks ever.....Ford was perfect for the roll, keeping that how did I get in to this mess look on his face throughout. Love it. Funny, intense, and suspenseful. Spielberg stays away from mocking anybody's religion, which in a film like this is hard to do. He doesn't make the Nazis look to be bumbling idiots, which is usually the case in action comedy's. If you haven't seen this in awhile, or you have been in Siberia for the last three decades. Watch it..... I suppose it leaves you wanting in some ways, but I guess that's what sequels are for. Great movie.....",9,0,0,7 June 2014
The Hateful Eight," Okay Quentin, we get it....you're allowed to use the 'n' word.
","This film has almost taken Tarantino to rock bottom basement. Turning Samual Jackson into a sex-offending racist doesn't make me feel any better about the rest of the racists in the room. If I'm not allowed, and I'm fine with it, to even write a specific word here on this site, what makes Quentin think I want to hear it 100 times in 160 excruciating minutes. Oh my God......my wife is African American; we love(d) Tarantino; what is he thinking? He has fallen into the shock factor safety net syndrome. If things get boring shout NI&&&R, or have Sam Jackson make a washed up rebel officer perform oral sex on him. WHAT? You can see what he was thinking: hey it worked in Pulp Fiction. And what a shame, all that talent, that beautiful cinematography.......what a pitiful shame. Q needs to go back to work at the video store where he was discovered, eat mac & cheese every night.......and use his genius. Write the truth Q. Even though his stuff was out there, it's beauty was in the fact that you heard truth. In HF8 I heard nothing but gratuitous racist crap and forced fake conversation. I was waiting for each character to raise their hand before standing to deliver a speech. Absolute garbage. Absolute trash.",1,62,126,15 January 2016
