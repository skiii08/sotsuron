The Equalizer," Not your average action film.
","Let me begin this review by saying that I've never seen the Equalizer TV show, so this review will be based on how I thought of the movie alone. This isn't the first time director Antoine Fuqua and actor Denzel Washington have worked together. Training Day was a film that produced a Best Actor for Denzel, so I was particularly excited for the two reuniting in an action film. However, this ain't your average action film. Fuqua really knows how to direct compelling action with an artistic framework. He's not like other directors who feel the need to unnecessarily shake the camera to hide the atrocious fight choreography and create cheap adrenaline, he actually uses the action to tell the character's story. You learn more about Washington's character through his fighting than you do through his dialogue. The film also had a strong antagonist, played by Marton Csokas, who had as much screen presence as the protagonist himself, which most action films lack, however, like I said before, this ain't your average action film. All that and a riveting action sequence that takes place in a hardware store should be enough to get your blood pumping for days on end.",8,1,7,28 September 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One: A 'Star Wars' Story
","This was my most anticipated film for 2016. I was more excited for this film than most people were, which is why this is so heartbreaking. I know I'm in the minority for this; a lot of people are enjoying this movie and I hate to rain on someone's parade, but I've got to be honest; I didn't think this was that good of a movie. The first trailer they released back in April (the one with the chill-inducing Empire sirens), before the re shoots, include like 50% of footage that didn't even make it into the film. Where are they? I get it though, re shoots are common; most big-budget movies do them. However, re watching that trailer again and remembering how f'in excited I got from the possibility of seeing a hard-hitting, war-central Star Wars movie with a dark, ominous tone just made me even more disappointed with the film we actually got. I loved 'The Force Awakens'. Yes, it borrowed excessively from 'A New Hope', but at least it felt like a Star Wars movie. ROGUE ONE on the other hand feels like a number of different things all thrown together; at times it was a gritty war film, other times it was a lighthearted comedy, and then we also got a space opera in there as well. This inconsistent and, honestly, incongruous mesh of tones ultimately brought the film down, which is frustrating given that when it focused entirely on one of the three aspects, it worked to a tee. Without giving away any spoilers, there was a certain CG character that, when you first see, is really quite shocking and uncanny. But my issues with it are more than just how it was done; it's why it was done. Personally, and this is just me, I thought what Disney/Lucasfilm did was unethical and wrong. If I were to rank the strengths of this film, Ben Mendelsohn would end up quite high on that list. He was such a different, yet remarkable Star Wars antagonist; if there was one character I wanted to learn more about, coming out of the theatre, it was without a doubt Orson Krennic. Other standouts included Donnie Yen, who has more than a few character-defining moments, and Diego Luna, who added a lot more depth to an otherwise underdeveloped character. In fact, I found most of the characters here underdeveloped and rather two-dimensional. I guess it's my fault I didn't take the time to read 'Catalyst', which is a novel in the Star Wars canon that apparently leads straight into ROGUE ONE. But then again, a movie should stand up as a movie and not rely on additional material. Do I really need to spend an extra 20 bucks and invest in hours of homework to 'get' this film and care about the characters? Apart from a couple scenes where she's actually quite good in, Felicity Jones just didn't do it for me; she consistently felt too one-note and passive in critical moments where I wanted her to step up and just blow the roof off the place. Someone else that was disappointing was Forest Whitaker. I love the guy as an actor, but what on God's green earth was he doing with his voice? It was so cringe and off-putting that I was pulled out of the film a number of times. Death Vader isn't featured much in the movie, but his looming presence is certainly felt. It's just; I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed by his minimal involvement. But I understand why he was used as sparingly as he was.One thing I thought ROGUE ONE did better than 'The Force Awakens', and absolutely deserves credit for, is expanding on the universe and enriching it rather than playing off it and making it feel smaller whether it be with characters that are not the obligatory Skywalkers or Solos, gorgeously imagined worlds, and novel thematic explorations. This is a Star Wars movie I believe kids won't enjoy as much; this is definitely more tailored to adults. And while that may have originally been a good idea, now having seen the movie I realize that was the wrong move. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a different change of pace. But Disney, if you're going to put the 'War' in Star Wars (I hate myself for using that phrase) then don't half- ass it. Don't get cold feet halfway through and re shoot the movie in order to lighten up the tone because then we end up with a film that doesn't know what it's trying to be. With all that being said, I have to admit that as many faults as this movie had, the final act is pretty incredible. They made some bold choices I didn't think they'd make but that felt right for the story, and I applaud director Gareth Edwards and Lucasfilm for that. In fact, the last few minutes are some of the greatest minutes in any Star Wars movie, leading into and tying very nicely with 'A New Hope'. Overall, this is a movie I don't feel inclined to rush back and watch on the big screen. The only reason I ended up investing (kinda) in the characters is because of the actors playing them; the writing under services everyone except for a select few like Krennic and K-2SO. I appreciated the tone they went for with the 'war' aspect, but the constant tonal clashes pulled me out and the action, while some of the best we've ever seen in a Star Wars movie, got repetitive pretty quickly. If for nothing else, the last thirty minutes of ROGUE ONE is something to cherish. Now that's a movie I'd watch over and over again.",6,3,7,17 December 2016
World War Z," Great thriller.
","This is a great thriller, filled with impressive visual effects and intense suspense. The set design of this film felt grandeur and spectacular, which I felt was great but it inhibited some much needed emotional human moments. Something this film had plenty of were jump scares, which can only be seen as effective in a zombie movie. I did like the realistic tone that was present throughout, making me believe that a zombie outbreak could really happen. Unlike I Am Legend, I thought the way World War Z solved this global catastrophe was believable and eye- opening. Of course the star of World War Z is Brad Pitt, and he does a great job in my opinion portraying the character. My real problem is with the actual character itself. It seems as if this guy is invincible and can overcome any obstacle that comes in his way. I didn't read the book so I'm not sure if that's how the character is written, but it did draw me out of the movie at times. The ending felt very rushed which did affect my grade of the movie; however this is a solid film with more style than substance.",7,1,2,30 September 2014
Black Mass," The Mob Film We've All Been Waiting For
","In 1970s Boston, FBI Agent John Connolly persuades Irish mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger to collaborate with the FBI and eliminate a common enemy: the Italian mob. BLACK MASS tells the story of this unholy alliance, which spiraled out of control, allowing Whitey to become one of the most ruthless gangsters in U.S. history.Directing can be thought of like this: give a person various ammunition and gunpowder, and see how big of a bang he or she can make. And there's no doubt that the greatest weapon in director Scott Cooper's arsenal is Johnny Depp. His performance as infamous Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger is mesmerizingly haunting. With piercing blue eyes and an apt demonic appearance, the make-up team's magnificent work allowed for Depp to walk in and completely knock it out of the park. To those who're charging down the streets at 15 miles an hour, screaming, 'Johnny Depp is back!' at the top of their lungs, I would ask: did he ever really leave? Or has he been here all along, tainted by the less-than-decent films he's appeared in? I'd put my money on the latter because, even with his most atrocious movies, he always loses himself in his characters. And that's what acting is all about.If there's anyone that can rival Depp's work here it would have to be Joel Edgerton, who actually ends up stealing the spotlight more than a few times and downright nailing it throughout. His character, placed at the center of the plot, is about as sympathetic as a corrupt FBI agent could possibly be, in a movie filled with unlikable characters. However, Depp and Edgerton aren't the only selling points here; Cooper is a filmmaker who's capable of working exceptionally well with ensembles. And with a cast as impressive as this: Kevin Bacon, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Corey Stoll just to name a few, it's hard to pinpoint a single weak link. This is the mob movie that fans of the genre have been waiting forever for; it is brutal, refreshing, and impossible to look away from. The story, however, is quite dense, and the occasional pacing issues didn't help. But the performances are what make it digestible, and what, ultimately, makes BLACK MASS one of the year's best.",9,6,23,16 September 2015
Suicide Squad," The Actors Save A Very Flawed, Yet Fun Movie
","If I had to describe 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman v Superman' with one word only, it would be 'divisive.' SUICIDE SQUAD falls into the same category. Even though I liked both MoS and BvS, one could say that those 2 films tried too hard to please critics. The admirable thing about SUICIDE SQUAD is that it disregards the critics altogether, and makes it an entirely fan experience, for better or worse depending on who you ask. The audience I saw it with was electrifying; it's, without a doubt, the most fun I've had all year since 'Deadpool' back in February. In my humble opinion, SUICIDE SQUAD is exactly what this lacklustre summer movie season needed to spice things up. Director David Ayer has his mark all over this; it's unlike any superhero movie I've ever seen. Sure, you have some of your typical superhero tropes, mostly in the 3rd act. But then you have the antithesis of what the genre entails, breaking just about every single rule and convention. This ain't good versus bad; this, my friends, is bad versus evil. This movie is the living personification of its own characters: absolute, bat sh*t insanity! It's uneven, character motivations get a little wonky, and the story is a hot, sexy, mess. Word of advice? Double down on the absurdity of it all; it gets pretty weird. But within all the madness, I couldn't help myself guys... I kind of loved this movie. It's by no means perfect, but I also feel like critics are over exaggerating the film's faults. I was never bored, not once. The film moves at a killer pace. There's quite a bit of exposition near the beginning, but after that the film kicks into high gear. Steven Prince's score, which was reminiscent of 'Pacific Rim' and the first 'Iron Man,' infused such infectious energy into the movie. The use of hit song after hit song got a bit overwhelming however, making the movie feel more like a music video at times.Filmed mostly in my home of Toronto, this was quite the surreal experience; I have walked through those streets before, and I have stood in those subway stations before. I was even an extra in the film. Did I make the cut? Well, that's a whole other story... but I ain't mad.I was genuinely shocked by how incredible Will Smith was in the role of Deadshot. Going in, I thought he'd be adequate but not too memorable. I was wrong; he is the best thing this movie has going for it. Scratch that. He comes real close to taking that title, but it's Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn that this movie will be long remembered for. She nails it. Absolutely nails it. Robbie is to Harley Quinn what RDJ is to Tony Stark: perfection. Joel Kinnaman was another standout for me. While the writing for his character felt the most forced out of everyone, his actual performance sells it well and makes me feel for a character I could, otherwise, care less for. The film is juggling a lot of characters, and that's never an easy task. Characters such as Killer Croc, Katana, and Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney was great?!) aren't given much backstory at all, but they were all given at least one great character moment: just one scene to make you fall in love with them. But if there's one obscure character that'll emerge as a fan favourite, it's definitely El Diablo. He's given a thoughtful backstory, an emotional character arc, and some kick ass action sequences. In fact, most of the action in the film was executed well. But there wasn't that one moment, like the 'warehouse scene' we got in BvS, that made me go 'holy sh*t'. if you ask me, Jared Leto had the toughest job of them all; he had to follow Heath Ledger's timeless performance as The Joker, which is an impossible feat. So, the best thing Leto could've done is something completely different; he should make it his own. Which is exactly what he did. Whenever he's on screen you can't help but be captivated by him. He's not in the movie all that much, but just enough to wet our appetites for this whole new incarnation of 'The Clown Prince of Crime,' while still honouring the name of the film. This is a Suicide Squad movie after all, not a Joker movie. It's ironic that in a movie about bad guys the worst part turned out to be the villain itself. The 'evil' in bad versus evil, if you will. I would've preferred a different antagonist altogether as the one we got here was pretty forgettable. Without giving any spoilers, the whole 'brother' angle was by far the worst thing in this movie. That's all I will say. People comparing this movie to last year's catastrophe 'Fantastic Four' need to drop whatever it is they're smoking. SUICIDE SQUAD has something that film didn't: personality. It has soul. There's a great deal of heart. The characters are dynamic. The team chemistry between all the actors was fantastic; even if you don't like the movie they're in, you'll still end up liking the Suicide Squad themselves. Am I saying you're gonna love this film? No. Am I saying you're wrong for having a different opinion than me? No. Am I saying that I had a great time at the theatre watching Suicide Squad? You're damn right I am. Go check it out.",5,3,6,5 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Marvel Studio's answer to The Dark Knight
","The best Marvel Cinematic Universe film there has ever been, with the exception of The Avengers. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is first and foremost a political thriller with the essence of a superhero movie. Returning to the role of Steve Rodgers, I can safely and assuredly say that Chris Evans is Captain America. One of the best parts of this sequel was the chemistry between the actors, especially between Evans and Scarlett Johansson. The dialogue they share stays compelling and doesn't feel forced at all. And speaking about not feeling forced, Anthony Mackie joins the cast as The Falcon. This could've easily been one of the weak points of the film, as history has proved that the addition of a sidekick tends to backfire on the film. However, Mackie does a great job in providing humour and playing a character that Rodgers can truly identify with and befriend, as they are both war veterans and have similar outlooks on life. Samuel Jackson has appeared in his fair share of Marvel films, yet he was always just a voice in the background. That couldn't be farther from the truth in Marvel's newest addition to their cinematic universe because Nick Fury finally gets down and gritty. The action has never been better and greater than they are here. From the martial arts style fights to the epic set piece battles to an incredibly shot car chase scene, this film will not only amaze superhero fans but action fans as well. Many people are interested about the Winter Soldier and if he is a worthy and menacing antagonist, and the answer to that question is an emphatic yes. Sebastian Stans's performances reminds me of Tom Hardy's Bane from The Dark Knight Rises in that both men have most of their face covered, with their eyes telling a story all on their own. Being the figure in the shadows and suddenly appearing out of nowhere throughout the movie was fantastic as it helped maintain the tone that the directors were gunning for. This is Marvel's response to The Dark Knight in terms of its dark and gritty approach, tackling spy and political themes that are very relevant in today's world. The Russo brother's directing of this film, I think, was probably the best aspect of it. They did a marvellous job in transitioning from the action scenes to the comedy, and then to the emotional character driven moments. Not to be out shined, the script was the best of the Marvel movies, and a large part of that was the character development, which some superhero movies tend to lack. Is it a great superhero movie? Yes. Is it a great MOVIE? Yes. Does it take the genre and go beyond its own limitations and journey into uncharted territory, just as The Dark Knight did? Yes. This is truly an exciting time to be living in.",10,0,1,23 September 2014
Pacific Rim," Know what you're getting into.
","No one should go into this movie expecting a flawless story with an Oscar-worthy script and character development because that's not what you will get from this movie. This movie is about MONSTERS versus ROBOTS, enough said. Apart from the breathe-taking CGI and action scenes, this movie does surprise with some great characters that actually have depth and a story, especially Mako and the commanding officer, Stacker. Idris Elba delivers a brilliant performance, making the viewing of Pacific Rim a better than expected movie. As long as you know what you're getting into, Pacific Rim should satisfy and even surprise.",8,0,2,28 September 2014
"Monsters, Inc."," Rewatchable Pixar classic.
","I fell in love with Monster,Inc. the first time I saw it as a kid. It was the movie I got most excited for to watch, fast forward eleven years and I still get excited for it. This monster world is so different from what we know yet so interesting and fun. Their source of power comes from the screams of children which seems so very strange but in the context of this film, makes perfect sense. I am never forced to accept anything the film throws at me, I choose to accept them because they make sense. Another important reason for why I love Monsters, Inc. is the characters. James P. Sullivan is our protagonist. He is very good at his job, known to many as the top Scarer in Monstropolis. Throughout this film, Sullivan's perspective on everything changes while his caring and comforting character grows stronger. His best friend and roommate, Mike Wazowski, is a funny and smart character who sometimes fails to see the obvious. He is full of energy and charisma, making it impossible for me to dislike him. Apart from the characters and the beautiful chemistry they share, the story is very well written and enjoyable. It had some hilarious laugh out loud moments, but also some very sad ones. The 3-D is okay, but seems non-existent at times. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet must do so, and those who have should go back and revisit it. It's the well written story, the colorful characters and the heart this film carries that makes it such a timeless classic.",9,0,1,30 September 2014
Inside Out," Welcome Back, Pixar
","INSIDE OUT (2015) centers on an eleven year-old girl named Riley and the emotions that run around inside her head.The thing with Hollywood these days is that a lot of the same ideas are recycled over and over again; the overwhelming number of sequels, prequels, remakes, and reboots all leave very little room for originality. And when something original comes by, not many people go see it. If only there was a studio that specialized in innovative storytelling and was capable of pulling in a large audience. If only.Monsters University and Brave weren't bad, they just weren't at the level we expect from Pixar. And with Cars 2 being a real stinker, the studio seemed like it was starting to lose steam. Does INSIDE OUT end the cold streak or does Pixar, the king of animation, finally get dethroned? Sit tight everyone; the king ain't going anywhere anytime soon.INSIDE OUT is colorfully vibrant, wonderfully voice-acted, thought provoking and emotionally resonant; it's a film kids will love for the world created, but one that adults will appreciate even more for a surprisingly mature and fascinating look at growing up.But what impressed me the most about INSIDE OUT is how it gets into the psyche of not only what it's like going growing up, but tackling the fear of what could happen, the disgust at what you don't understand, the anger when things don't go as planned, the sadness when you're in the worst situation, and the joy when you realize that what happens ultimately happens for a reason, and life continues to go on despite it.If I had one gripe, though, it would be that the film focuses a little too much on the journey inside her head, rather than show a little more of Riley from the outside. The scenes where we travel inside her head and back out were some of the best in the movie, and I would've liked to see more of that inside and outside contrast.All I can say is thank you Pixar, thank you for staying original and, yet again, capturing the hearts of all of those who dare to dream, all those who fight to preserve what little imagination is left inside.",9,6,29,20 June 2015
Non-Stop," Surprisingly entertaining.
","A smart action flick, which will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Liam Neeson leads a surprisingly developed and interesting cast of characters, played by actors including Julianne Moore, Scoot McNairy, Corey Stoll, and Michelle Dockery. Unlike other films, Non-Stop establishes its tone and stays true to it till the very end. This film is for both action buffs and mystery lovers. There are some elements in the film that are relevant to social issues involving national security and how to maintain it. If you can overlook the convenience of how the plot unfolds, then I guarantee an entertaining time.",7,0,2,23 September 2014
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Favorite movie of 2011.
","This was my favourite movie of 2011. From the very beginning, I was emotionally invested and throughout the film I am kept invested with no instances of dissatisfaction or tedium. The movie started and before I knew it, the movie had finished. There are no moments that really slow down the plot, every scene is there for a purpose. James Franco did a great job to humanize Caesar, making me feel sorry and sympathetic to the apes. This sympathy let me know that it was okay to side with the apes, even if they were against my own species. Freida Pinto played the role of Franco's wife, but more importantly as his mentor. She warns him about the way he is raising Caesar saying 'You're trying to control things that aren't meant to be controlled,' 'Some things aren't meant to be changed -- you have to accept that!'Despite all the good performances, the star of this movie is undoubtedly Caesar. I met him when he was a baby and got to know him more as he grew up under human teachings. It is both interesting and satisfying to see him explore this world that apes are unfamiliar with. When he meets other humans who are not as nice and accepting as Will is, his perspective on everything changes. He becomes much darker, letting go of his human ties and embracing his own kind. With much determination he leads all the apes to freedom. What's so great about Caesar is that he has lived with both the humans and apes. He loves Will, but he also knows that he belongs with his own family, and so he fights for them. Their revolution was never intended to kill off the human race and take over the world; it was to send a message. They wanted to stand up for themselves and show the humans that they are more than just a pet or display. This movie has a masterful story, a beautifully written protagonist, great CGI, a powerful soundtrack and the ability to keep you coming back over and over again.",9,3,5,30 September 2014
Legend," Tom Hardy Shines In An Otherwise Dull Film
","LEGEND tells the true story of identical twin gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray, two of the most notorious criminals in British history, as they build their organized crime empire and terrorize London during the 1950s and 60s. Tom Hardy is the reason you see this movie. His double performance was captivating, and the special effects that made this binary show possible were just as impressive. Within mere minutes of this film you completely forget that one man plays these two characters. Hardy is able to convincingly disappear into each, playing the sane Reggie Kray with charming subtlety and the insane Ronnie with unnerving humor. And while Hardy is excellent, the rest of the film is sadly not. As an overall film, it's not that compelling to watch. Historically speaking, it's intriguing for sure; it's just not something that'll keep you on the edge of your seat for over 2 hours. This has a lot to do with the tonally incoherent nature of LEGEND; it doesn't know what it wants to be, juggling drama and comedy quite unevenly. The voice-over narration by Emily Browning, who played Frances, was good and all, but it's implausibility kept taking me out of the movie. What I mean by that is, as a framing device for the story, it was incongruous; more than half the events that she narrated didn't even involve her whatsoever. Also, her character felt more like a means to an end than she did an end in itself, serving the characters around her better than she ultimately served herself. The best way to describe the kind of vibe that director Brian Helgeland was attempting here is 'British Martin Scorsese' film. Not in terms of quality per se, but definitely with regards to feel. The injection of pop music throughout, along with a glossy sheen, gives LEGEND plenty of charismatic, larger-than-life, personality. Unfortunately, the film's messy structure hinders it from ever taking shape. But you know what they say: a messy house is a sign of character, and that may be the highest praise I can give to a movie I desperately wanted to love, but, at the end of the day, have trouble calling good.",6,2,4,16 September 2015
Get Out," GET OUT of your house and go watch this now!
","This is Jordan Peele's feature directorial debut, and what's interesting here is that GET OUT is uncharted territory for him as he comes from a comedic background. But, watching this movie, it felt like he's been directing horror his whole life. To put it simply, the guy knocks it out of the park. It's an artfully crafted and remarkably accomplished debut. He exploits an atmosphere impregnated with tension and skillfully choreographs an escalation of unrelenting suspense and crowd-pleasing thrills. The camera-work was absolutely ingenious; there's a scene involving hypnosis, in particular that had my jaw hitting the floor. I loved how they visually achieved that heightened state of suggestibility on a visual level. GET OUT is as much satire as it is horror though. And its most impressive feat is how masterfully it blends the two together. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that so seamlessly shifts from sequences of jubilant laughter to instances of insidious horror in a matter of minutes. Writing satire is tough, writing good satire is even tougher, and writing good horror-satire is as rare of a commodity as you get in the film industry these days. To achieve this a film must have exquisite timing and near-prefect pacing, which is exactly what GET OUT has. The run-time is 103 minutes, yet it felt more like an hour. I guess I got so invested in this engaging story that I lost all sense of time, which is what you ultimately want in any movie, really. Daniel Kaluuya showcases his acting chops with an impressive range of emotions; it's not necessarily what he says but what he doesn't say that has the biggest impact. Other standouts include Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford, and Catherine Keener. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention comic Lil Rel Howery, who plays TSA agent Rod, aka the protagonist's best friend. He's definitely a scene-steal-er, breaking the film's uncanny tension with a number of gut-busting interludes.While GET OUT sets out to mainly entertain and shock, it's also accompanied with some poignant social commentary. It shines light on the aspect of ourselves that we'd rather not acknowledge. No matter how much we try to convince ourselves that we're above implicit stereotyping or forming preconceptions, we aren't. Peele uses this unavoidable, unflattering truth to draw out anxiety, and then he uses that anxiety as fuel for the film itself. GET OUT is one of the best movies to come out of 2017 thus far. I can't recommend it enough.",9,22,49,24 February 2017
X-Men: The Last Stand," Disappointing.
","If you have seen the first two X-Men movies, then you know that X-Men 3 feels different. Of course with a new director changes are to be expected, but how much can be different till we can't tolerate them anymore. The first half of this movie was very good, but I started to check my phone a lot after the midpoint. The film wasn't flowing uniformly, but in all types of directions mixed with questionable pacing. Another thing that kept distracting me was the awful CGI, which surprised me because of how well done the CGI was in this film predecessor. The last two X-Men films had really good and enthralling stories which to me felt absent in X3. The acting was still very good, especially from Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, but the chemistry between the characters was poor and made me feel, dare I say, quite bored. Also, the film's third act feels very rushed in wrapping up the character's journey and the film itself. Now let us move on to the good things about this film. As always the score is fantastic and is, in my opinion, one of the best superhero themes in film. As mentioned above, the individual acting is good but the collective chemistry is off. Overall I wouldn't recommend watching this movie unless you are a big X-Men fan, which is not a bright idea as you might feel even more disappointed than the rest of us.",3,0,1,23 September 2014
Straight Outta Compton," An Unapologetic Biopic That's As Powerful As The Group It Follows
","In the 80s, a revolutionary new group enters the limelight, changing music and pop culture forever. Straight Outta Compton, N.W.A's first ever album, proves controversial with its brutal, yet honest, depiction of life in Southern LA . With guidance from their manager, band members Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, DJ Yella and MC Ren trail-blaze their way through the industry, scoring fame, fortune and a place in history. Cleverly devised and rhythmically paced, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is one of the most powerful biopics in recent memory. The cast is fantastic. Watching these guys perform really makes you believe they went through all this; you lose yourself in the story, and find yourself transported back in time. O'Shea Jackson portrays his own father, Ice Cube, and while there's an uncanny resemblance in his appearance, it's ultimately more than how he looks; it's how he acts. One could say the only reason his performance is as good as it is here is because he knew his father better than most, perfectly channeling that and delivering something genuine. But I, for one, would like to see more of him in other roles. Visually, the film is beautiful to look at; which comes as no surprise once you realize who the cinematographer is. Matthew Libatique, who's worked on Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan, as well as Iron Man, shoots this brilliantly; giving each scene it's own unique voice. There's a noticeable haze during the earlier moments, when they're on the streets of LA, that gives these scenes a nostalgic tinge. And then there's the electrifying use of vibrant colors during the larger- than-life concert scenes that completely immerses you, making you wish you were there to experience it all. If I had one gripe, it'd be that the film loses some steam towards the end. That's about it. I don't care if it sugarcoats things that happened with the real N.W.A; I judge movies on what they show, not on what they don't. This is an important, educational, and, at the same time, great movie that unapologetically touches a sensitive nerve that's, sadly, still relevant to this very day.",9,9,40,16 September 2015
The Silence of the Lambs," Are you up for the challenge?
","Very well directed with a heavy and ominous tone that shadows the entire movie. The sound and editing all function in creating and maintaining the film's eerie atmosphere. Reviewing this film, how could one not mention Anthony Hopkins chilling and creepy performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He portrays, without a doubt, one of the best psychotic characters in cinema history. He's so good that at one point, you may start to, dare I say, root for him? The chemistry between Hopkins and Jodie Foster's character is brilliant and the dialogue between them is masterfully crafted. Once you let Hannibal into your mind, you can never get him out. After watching The Silence of the Lambs, I don't think I can ever forget it. Are you up for the challenge?",9,3,5,23 September 2014
X-Men: First Class," Part of the elite group of comic book films.
","This was a very pleasant surprise. After the infamous X3 and X-Men Origins, the X-Men franchise was slowly crumbling. One good movie could rejuvenate the franchise; instead we got a fantastic movie. The acting stood out, especially Michael Fassbender's performance as a young Magneto. I was immediately invested in the story and captivated by the progression of Magneto's character. I thought this was done very well. X-Men: First Class is not your typical summer blockbuster; it's got more layers to it. For one, the script is witty and effective. I found myself on the edge of my seat just waiting for the very well written dialogue. Another merit this film carries is the amazing soundtrack composed by Henry Jackman. It was evident that Hans Zimmer had his fingerprints all over it, for the music sounded similar to Inception, which is never a bad thing. Watching all my favorite X-Men characters when they were young was really cool, and just makes this film all the more special to me. I would rank this film among the greatest superhero/comic book movies ever made.",9,1,2,23 September 2014
The Wolverine," Alright.
","The Wolverine had the task of rejuvenating the Wolverine franchise after the failed attempt of X- Men Origins. Did it succeed? Did it fail? I think it did pretty alright. This was mostly a character driven film with very little plot. It starts off strong with a very emotional and intense scene, but from there the film starts to lose path. The viper chick was a useless character that felt forced into the script in order to have more than two mutants. The Wolverine lacked a villain with strong presence, a plot, and an impactful score especially for a superhero movie. Hugh Jackman is at his best, and at this point it feels as if nobody else can play the legendary comic book character but him. The fight scenes had very good choreography, but the shaky camera made it hard to focus in what was going on. I especially like the train fight scene, even if it did make the eyebrows of every physicist rise. I appreciate this movie because they are at least on the right path to making wolverine movies, which origins failed to accomplish, but I cannot excuse The Wolverine of its empty plot driven solely on the development of one character surrounded by many seemingly empty characters.",6,0,2,30 September 2014
Her," One of a kind.
","Directed and written by Spike Jonze, Her is one of the best movies of the year. Joaquin Phoenix plays a divorced man who falls in love with his operating system. On surface it sounds laughable and a bit creepy, yet that couldn't be farther from the truth. Joaquin delivers the performance of his career with such innocence and melancholy that we can actually see the beauty in this relationship. Scarlett Johansson voices Samantha, the advanced operating system, and does an equally magnificent job. The fact that we never saw her in the movie is a credit to her, and should open the possibility of a voice acting award at the Oscars. This movie portrays a futuristic atmosphere with stunning cinematography, no so much that its feels unfamiliar, but enough to stimulate our imaginations. The script is the best of the year, and that's saying something. Every scene made path to the next so fluently, every word provoked the next with such fluidity, and the music set the tone so magically. This movie is one of a kind, and will touch your hearts as it did mine.",10,0,1,23 September 2014
The Martian," I'm going to have to review the sh*t out of this
","THE MARTIAN follows botanist Mark Watney who, during a manned mission to Mars, is hit by a fierce storm and left behind by his crew who presume that he's dead. But little did they know that he's still very much alive, stranded on the hostile planet. With limited resources at hand, Watney must draw upon his ingenuity in order to survive. Having only seen the trailers, I went into this film unaware of how much humor there would actually be. In that regard, it's quite faithful to the source material; Drew Goddard was able to inherit author Andy Weir's snarky dialogue and translate it from the pages of a novel onto the pages of a screenplay, while Sir Ridley Scott brought it all to life. Speaking of Ridley Scott, it looked as if the legendary director's best days were behind him, entering a career slump of sorts with The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings, both of which were dull and uninspired chapters of his otherwise impressive filmography. THE MARTIAN, however, marks Ridley Scott 's return to form. It's captivating from beginning to end, enjoyable from beginning to end, and is full of personality from, you guessed it, beginning to end.A lot of that personality, if not all of it, is due to the incredible group of actors that have been rounded up here, most notably Matt Damon. If not for him and the way he charismatically delivers his lines the sarcastic dialogue, which is really just Damon talking to a video recorder, would 've just ended up being really awkward. Chewitel Ejiofor and Jessica Chastain both make strong impressions as well, along with the rest of the cast who have small, yet potent moments of their own. Despite having convincing performances, the film didn't do as good of a job trying to get me to naturally invest in these characters. Sure, you care for Mark Watney's life but that's only because of the situations that the story places him in and forces him to face; there was no real emotional through line for me to grab hold of. But the thing that stops me from calling THE MARTIAN 'great' is that it's a very safe, by the numbers, sci-fi film. It doesn't have the technical drive of Gravity or the emotional punch of Interstellar; it's very good, but it could've been so much more.",8,52,157,17 September 2015
