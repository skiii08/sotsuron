Come and See," Unforgettable.
",I saw this movie in TV sometime in the late 80's. Never dared near it since. The most harrowing war movie of all time.,9,1,1,25 January 2019
Scarface," Modern Classic
",Talking about entertainment value...say hello to my Litttle Friendd !!!.,10,0,1,29 March 2019
L.A. Confidential," Stellar in every way
",Can't think of a more perfect crime movie than L.A. Confidential. Very good performances by everybody in the cast. Especially the scenes between Crowe and Basinger are an acting masterclass. The script is very suspenseful and multi-layered until the final seconds. Also the main theme is a classic. The production and entertainment values of this movie are so high that the film stands five viewings easy.,10,1,1,17 August 2019
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino's worst
","Overlong by 60 minutes. Combined with uninteresting script and characters, this made Hateful Eight painful to watch. The only redeeming feature of this movie is that it gave employment to Jennifer Jason Leigh.Quentin Tarantino has become an auteur without reins. Seems that nobody really dares to responsibly produce his films. All his movies since Jackie Brown have been at least overlong (Django, Kill Bill), and at worst self-indulgent and boring (Inglorious Basterds and this one).",5,1,5,12 May 2019
Predator," Classic Ah-nuld action !
","They really don't make movies like this any more. The end of the 80's was the golden era of big-screen macho violence. Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, Rambo, Predator, Terminator, you name it. Today we have some soy-boy sensitive pretty boys like Gosling whining their way through endlessly boring action pastiches like The Nice Guys. Why, oh why. Where have all the good and manly action movies gone.",10,3,3,24 February 2020
The Revenant," Got to have respect
","Hard-won victory for DiCaprio and all parties concerned !. The level of realism in this movie is staggering, on a par with classics like Deliverance and Saving Private Ryan. Not the most happy movie to watch, though...",8,1,1,4 March 2019
We're the Millers," Jennifer Aniston makes a lousy stripper
","What a borefest, after a promising start. The basic concept of this movie was good and funny. The execution however was totally mild and PG. 44 years old Jennifer Aniston was miscast as the stripper, and her performance was totally stiff and prudish. Maybe she tried to somehow repeat Demi Moore's and Natalie Portman's sizzling performances, who knows. The Mexican sex joke has been seen and heard million times, and this movie's version of it was totally inept.",4,1,4,4 September 2019
Drive," Tour de Force
","Drive is the best crime flick of the last ten years. Gosling's wonderful and painful portrayal of alienated outsiderness is balanced by a very humane and worthwhile Carey Mulligan. Very cool combinations of sound and picture. Exceptional casting, wardrobe, photography and production values overall. Drive is also exemplary in Its tightness - only 100 minutes long, no time wasted, no time to get bored. In my book this film belongs to the same league of modern crime classics as Heat and To Live and Die in L.A.",10,1,2,6 August 2019
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Swedish male-hate propaganda
","Though technically a brilliant thriller, the subcontent of this movie is rather off-putting. You will notice it when you have seen more contemporary Swedish cinema. Every male character is a portrayed as a pervert or a weakling or a subdued male servant. This is the only way men are portrayed in the Swedish cinema today, and after five movies it gets tiresome.",6,1,5,3 May 2019
The Hangover Part II," Hilarious comedy romp
","There is something fresh about these Hangover movies, which I like very much. They are dirty and mean enough to be funny, and they are made on a good budget. The funniest scene in this movie was between the Thai transvestite and the dentist-nerd. Hope there will be spin-off sequels by this same crew.",8,0,1,19 August 2019
Blood Diamond," Proper adventure movie !
","Southern Africa provides good stories and surroundings, and Di Caprio inhabits his role very well. Only minus in my opinion is that the film lacks a bit of focus and direction, i.e it sprawls a bit.",8,2,2,5 May 2019
Sicario," Blunt and del Toro
","In my opinion Emily BluntÂ´s character is vital to the movie. Anyone who criticizes her being 'fake' is wrong. She brings the necessary human point of view to the proceedings and is a person you can relate to. Without her this movie would be rather uninteresting.Benicio of course owns the movie. The script, principal photography, direction and score by Johanssen are perfect. My only gripe concerns the lack of 'soul', which is rather common with technically brilliant movies and directors - say Christopher Nolan and Stanley Kubrick for instance. That is perhaps the only thing that hinders Sicario from entering the club of truly classic crime films like The French Connection and L.A Confidential.",9,1,2,25 January 2019
Fast Five," Best of a bad lot
","Fast & Furious movies are for teen boneheads and nobody else. Filled with ridiculous posing, wooden actors and ludicrous action scenes. Part 5 of the series is the best and the only installment I have been able to watch from start to finish. This is mainly because of excellent locations (Brazil) and hot chicks in the movie.",6,0,2,19 August 2019
Spectre," Heinously boring
","Literally stopped watching at 40-minute mark. I have seen this random posing, running and jumping in the three previous Craig-Bonds already. Daniel Craig is a wooden actor compared to Brosnan or Connery. Also the product placement and 'jet set' commercialization of the Bond series have started to annoy me immensely. Some Russian or Middle-Eastern youngster might find bling still fascinating, but for a western person these depictions of opulence offer nothing. I don't pay ticket price or waste time to watch a 3-hour movie that is practically a car- or smartphone ad.",3,0,4,5 May 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Bloated.
","Too much money and overproduction. The Road Warrior was lean, mean and tight action classic. This is a Disney version of it, a kiddie movie. Hope if Miller still makes another Mad Max sequel, it will be back to the roots. I don't believe that will happen. George Miller 'grew up' and started avoiding hard violence. He should stick to family movies if anything. This franchise is dead.",6,2,4,2 April 2019
