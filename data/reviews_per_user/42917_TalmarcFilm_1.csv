3:10 to Yuma," Real Western Rides Again!
","And what a great script and performance by Christian Bale and Russell Crowe -- Peter Fonda was perfectly cast. This is a real down to earth blood and guts good guy vs bad guy shoot 'em up! Lots of horse action like a great Western should have and the tempo was great through out, watch out for young actor Logan Lerman -- he stole the show. Finally a decent picture with the sense to do it right. Screenwriters knew exactly where to plant all the right cues and actors delivered-- Mangold's direction showed throughout -- with this cast, just keep it tight on the page. Excellent job and hats off to your cinematographer and production designer-- you could feel the action -- hell, you could taste the action. Thanks for bringing a classic tale and an American art form back to the West!",10,3,7,7 September 2007
