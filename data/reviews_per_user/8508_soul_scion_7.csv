The Young Victoria," Beautiful historical drama without being overcooked
","Overall, I thought it a very nice movie - I hate to use the word 'nice' as it's rather dry but it was very beautiful to look at and the central performances by Rupert Friend and Emily Blunt were very strong. What I liked most was that despite the gleaming aesthetics of the costumes and the settings, all gilded and shiny, this aspect never took over the heart of the film which was good, strong writing (thank you Julian Fellowes :D); nothing too flamboyant or saturated with pomp, i.e not sensationalised greatly (when Victoria is dragged out of bed to be informed she is now Queen, well you couldn't get a less glamorous hand over of the crown). It was paced gently and every line in the film held its worth.Undoubtedly the portrayal of the love between Victoria and Albert, though somewhat fairytale-ish on the face it, was in fact a slow burning candle and Friend and Blunt did well to show how effortlessly these two people 'fitted' together despite the union being initially arranged (my fave bit was when they come home after hunting and Victoria simply hugs her new husband from behind; so much said without any words, that's what film is all about). Blunt held her own beautifully as well, she has a face that demands your attention and I can't not mention the costumes that she wears - every one simply gorgeous. If I was Blunt I would have trouble parting with any of them! The rest of the ensemble cast all played their roles well, Harriet Walter as Queen Adelaide being a highlight.The only qualm I have, is that it lacked a sense of urgency, or an event that could have made the movie a little more exciting? (It was rather tame) I don't know, I wanted 'something' to happen that would have Victoria draw out some strength and prove her worth a little more. When she and Albert argued, I loved it, I could have done with some more pivotal dramatic moments, though that may be just me.Lastly, at the risk of sounding all patriotic, it did renew a sort of pride and awe in the crown and what it takes to be in such a position, especially in one so young. This may be in part to the fact that this film's snap shot of Victoria's young life is immediately apt to what I have been writing for one character of mine in 'The Sword & The Scion' but nevertheless, it did flag up those feelings (for those following my book, can you guess what character Victoria so aptly reflects?) It might have been in part to the film displaying how ridiculous the government were back in those times as they didn't seem to give two hoots about the poor and dispossessed of the nation, which only in turns renews appreciation that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were so active in this domestic domain. It made the government appear rather useless - nothing much has changed then I suppose.BLOG on films and books: http://sempergratis.blogspot.com",7,2,2,15 March 2010
The Hunger Games," The Hunger Games misses the mark - on so many accounts
","*SPOILERS ALERT* Dare I say it, this relatively passage film was extremely lazily adapted from the book. It took too long to 'get to the good stuff' and there were some other obvious flaws that have nothing to do with flaws from the book itself - it's all down to the film-makers.I kind of guessed at this the moment the film opened and we see Game-Maker, Seneca Crane talking to blue haired presenter (played solidly well by Stanley Tucci) - and it became a continual problem - removing us out of Katniss's POV and the games and into the 'behind-the-scenes' world of the Capitol. UGH. It completely leached the strength of menace that an antagonist has - seeing Presi Snow chatting to Crane on various occasions, I sat there trying to fathom why this was in the narrative at all. It's like seeing the most bad ass robot and then they take you to see it nuts and bolts - or find it works on water. Lame.Another issues were Peeta and Katniss - it wasn't good chemistry between Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, but Josh came across stronger in his performance as the 'boy with the bread'. Which also brings me to the 'bread' scene - why is it raining and why wasn't it made clear that Katniss was literally starving to death with nothing to take to her family? (she never looked like she ever struggled to get food). The flashbacks were lazy and confusing. If we knew she was at the end of her tether, that moment would have been more significant and so to, their relationship. Instead, when it's time for Katniss to turn on the 'charm', it's not even obvious that she has turned on anything. And then we kept cutting to see Gale in District 12, it was clear the filmmakers had NO flair. The scenes with Rue were rushed and void of depth. And if they'd done the bread scene properly, we'd have known that Katniss does whatever it takes to survive - she's survived near death before - this is her trait, her winning element - not the bow and arrow. And she isn't shown to change or evolve - she is as she started. MINUS 20 POINTS!And if that wasn't bad enough, we had some weird cutaways to blue haired presenter and the other dude, 'info dumping' but it felt like those commentary scenes in Dodgeball - I expected them to say there would be a 'Half time show'. (How else would they have given us the info, I hear you ask. Well, a 1 min montage showing Peeta and Katniss viewing the previous Hunger Games tapes and picking up on various booby traps and format the games take). Again, it wasn't well integrated into the character development of Katniss - how amazing would it have been if the filmmakers had shot it so that it's as if we're the viewers of the The Hunger Games, not the viewers watching the viewers watching the games. Make sense? Then the Capitol would have come across as this unreachable, unseeable terrible master - and there would have been more suspense when the crazy dogs come, or whenever anything was 'dropped' into the world. Adaptation rule - keep it contained! And heck, if you want to break from Katniss's POV, why don't we get some of Peeta's POV? Furthermore, how the film portrayed the Capitol and its citizens was lacking. There was less impact of the 'us and them' mentality. Small scenes in the book like when Cinna (well played by Kravtiz) orders any food they want and then realises how 'disgusting' the Capitolians must appear to the District 12ers would have brought that home more. Also, Katniss's styling team wasn't there to show how they treat her like a pet - encapsulating the mental nature of the Capitol - how to them it's so harmless, which is to be pitied, whilst also being disgusting.Otherwise, Katniss is disappointingly 'flat', though there are good moments. The thing that essentially killed it for me, was the climactic berry scene - when they both realise they have to kill one another, the conflict is supposed to be so high - and we see how Peeta is more 'the good one'. There is no time to properly show how Katniss comes to the realisation that the Capitol won't be happy if there isn't a victor. This is the MOMENT. Instead it's over in two seconds. I wanted to scream.And DoP - we get the hand-held camera stuff/CUs are there to make us feel awkward and uncomfortable. Methinks it was overkill in trying to 'glean' over the initial Cornucopia scene where 11 die straight away. Again, it was obvious the filmmakers didn't want to show us the real state of this bloodthirsty situation. This was added to by the idea that it never really felt like any of the kids were fighting for their lives - Cato et al kept running around and whooping as if they were having a ball, when really there's supposed to be a sinister undertone to it all. It just WASN'T BADASS ENOUGH! You might be forgiven in thinking that I severely disliked this film but as it is, it wasn't terrible. But yet again, it fell far short of the mark in getting to greatness. And this is the best book of the series so *shrug* Finally, if you really want to see a damn good portrayal of teenagers in a fight to survive or be killed scenario, rent 'Battle Royale' where the insanely maddening stakes are given due respect and intelligence.",6,8,15,25 March 2012
Superbad," Superbad is SUPERBAD!
","literally, this movie was appalling. Apart from the character of Evan who is endearing partly because his voice is exactly like my cousins and god, he can actually act but the rest of the film...what was it even? A whole load of mess. Maybe that's the point, what with the obsession with sex and drunkeness etc etc. It was so unclassy. Maybe that's the point.Plus there were absolutely no laugh out loud moments whatsoever. I kept waiting and waiting...but none came. And I guess it was supposed to have some sort of 'heart' in the middle showcased between to the two best friends but it just got muddled among the nonsensical rubbish and the whining of the fat Seth. Frankly, I'm sitting there thinking why am I watching this very unlikeable character whine and swear ALL the time. Jeez.And the nonsense with that McLovin and the police. Dismal. Was that supposed to be funny? I just felt like Superbad should have been an animation a la South Park, not something that needed time or energy going on film. What a damned shame.",2,4,9,18 April 2008
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Tell me why this movie is so great?
","I have watched Crouching Tiger twice now and I still fail to see what is so damn wonderful about the movie. I like the visuals cos lets face it the visuals are great but what is so great about the content? the story is a load of pants. the ending is pants as well - not to mention - wat is the point? talk about a weak ending. i hate endings like that. it just shows really weak character which was basically what zhang ziyi's character was. acting by michelle yeoh and chow yun fat was good, granted. but so much of it was pansy.... anywayz thats my opinion. the martial arts were great tho and the music but that is all. my sis absolutely loves it tho and i guess i partly dislike it cos she blabs about it so much. personally...i preferred 'hero'.",Null,0,1,15 November 2004
Hero," this was good stuff
","i really enjoyed watching this movie and i'm so glad i didn't read any spoilers like my sis did and went in completely unaware. firstly, the stunning use of colour was wonderful. there were some great scenes and even though many people think the movie has a weak story i personally think it was better than that of 'crouching tiger'. i liked the fact that the director disorientated the audience with 'the fake versions of what happened'. the fight scenes were good too, breathtaking in some parts. i loved the theme of fighting not being about fighting if you get what i mean. and my fave scene was tony leung vs the emperor - all that use of green - superb. yes one mite say that the use of colour is cliché but it worked wonderfully. there's just something so simply pure about it - its not trying to have this deep, complicated symbolism. i basically wasn't bored like i was in 'crouching tiger'. some parts of the movie were odd and didn't work well but overall it was a good Chinese movie and one of the better ones I've seen. i was so glad it wasn't like 'road home' or anything - road home isn't bad, just so damn slow. and i did like the whole patriotic china bit too. i thought it was a nice touch, and oddly moving. yes, it mite have been catered for the western world, but it hit home to me in London, so i guess it worked. definitely worth my time and money.",Null,2,4,15 November 2004
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," For once I wasn't disappointed - not even a little bit! awesomo!
","Well I went into this movie without many expectations and without rereading the book (it was my least fave) but having said that, this film i enjoyed so much and didn't come out thinking 'omg what was that?' What really made this good was the fact that everyone acted really well for once. Nothing felt too contrived. There were a lot of moments skirted over (i'm glad they cut all that stuff about cleaning out the house) but they kept all the key checkpoints. And for once, one could emote with Harry. His performance was top here and I could really feel his anguish and despair. Well done Radcliffe. What was also a plus was Luna - really well cast as was Umbridge (i was skeptical at first cos at first glance you just want to hug Imelda Staunton).The SFX was great too and the climax at the Ministry was given full justice (unlike last film's).The use of hand-held shots was refreshing too. And nice moments caught by the director esp with Ginny. (v.subtle but there nonetheless).Definitely the best Potter movie since the debacle of no.3 and 4. If you treat it as a separate entity to the book.",7,0,4,14 July 2007
X-Men: First Class," First Class Superhero Movie
","I had the good fortune of being invited out to the media preview of this film yesterday in London and as a result, was tres excited, partly because I had a gut feeling that this film, the fourth in the X-Men franchise, would surpass the two predecessors.**SPOILERS ALERT*** Anyhow, launching into the content. Twas good, twas very good and I can't speak for the die hard fans of the series but this will be winner for mainstream audiences for sure - and once more restore the super hero genre somewhat. The action sequences were brilliant without being thrown in there just for the hell of it, the performances by James McAvoy as Charles Xavier was right on point and even Michael Fassbender was intense, tortured (and witty!) as Eric (save for the blatant Irish accent creeping in at the end of the film but that's really minor) Special mention goes to Bill Milner, who plays the young Eric - his scene in the Nazi office - enough said.The film doesn't introduce anything new thematically, as it rotates around the concept of fear and hatred of the new and the misunderstood and questions of what evolution really means – it simply sets up (or rather builds upon, in reverse..?) the two opposing sides that will go on to be represented by Professor X and Magneto. And as most people know, I love going 'back to the start' and revealing what makes characters become who they are. Additionally, the pace carried the film well, considering it was over 2 hours long.The film and the cast are all beautiful to watch, with solid performances from all, though its McAvoy, Fassbender and Bacon that do the heavy lifting. The score is intense but in parts I felt like it was doing too much of the work.The script was decent as well and there were only perhaps two lines that were lame in all, so for a super hero movie, that's pretty damn good going.While the mutant characters were engaging enough and felt fully formed, the film painted the rest of humanity as rather dim and grey - I don't fault the movie for that really, it's nigh impossible to show the full spectrum of people but those characters supposedly in power – generals and whatnots, just felt like puppets – but I think that was the point. Talk about ineffective humans – especially those in authority (and doesn't that reflect reality? Ouch!) There were great moments of levity, mostly through Charles Xavier's lines but by far the best sequence was when Eric and Charles team up for the first time and begin recruiting – there's a brilliant inside joke thrown in there that references the original movies – and it had everyone in the cinema laughing.What's more, on a more broad note, the film does keep that question hanging for you – what would you do if you were the more evolved version of the human species? It's a probing enough question but not one that is overbearing to the content or properly explored - which is a wise move, considering all the other movies pick up on that. So you leave feeling you watched a more than decent superhero movie with fair creditability and lots of fun to boot - that surpassed no. 2 and 3 (which isn't hard but if you get stuck in a formula it could go stale and smell bad, like the Star Wars going back to the beginning nonsense. It didn't do that - it got a new lease of life). Plus, if James McAvoy is in it, there's something of worth there, surely? From",8,19,34,26 May 2011
