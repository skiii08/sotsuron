Love and Death," the original Woody Allen film
","I have seen Woody Allen's 'Love and Death' several times through the years and I kind of look at it as a standard bearer for Woody's films, a sort of litmus test: how funny is the movie compared to 'Love and Death'? Though I have seen almost his entire oeuvre, I think of this one as his break out film, the real Woody as filmmaker, while allowing us to see the true comic genius he is as a performer and filmmaker. Too bad the French appreciate him more than we do as an American audience, which is why they heaped awards and praise upon him through his life.I think what gets by many people is that Woody can also be a serious artistic film director, as surely as any Europe produced in the latter twentieth century. Like any of those efforts, Woody uses the whole drama canvass and this is where he stands apart. Does he repeat himself sometimes through his movies? Sure, but how many times did Van Gogh or Picasso repeat themselves? Celluloid is the same as those other mediums.But upon watching this movie again this week, it made me realize something I have not seen in the other reviews, the influence of the Marx brothers comedies on this film. The obvious zinging sounds, the casual verbal double entendre repartee, the put upon Napoleon double, it's all there. Another insight I picked up this time is that fourth wall breakdown, connection to the audience. While that was standard in early t.v. comedies such as the variety shows, in movies, Woody really pioneers that effort, mimicked to great effect in 'Ferris Buller's Day Off' and even not so great films such as 'Kuffs'.The film is essentially a riff on Russian Literature, Russian music, Ingmar Bergman films, European philosophy, stream-of-consciousness self-awareness. Woody was self mocking Jewishness long before Sasha Baron Cohen and his Borat character arrived on the scene - the purists out there will state Jackie Mason actually pioneered this but not in film. Either way, if one were to begin watching Woody Allen films, this would be the start, where he finally perfected the comic template that would not change until he started channeling his inner Bergman.Sidenote: I actually have seen Woody in person, up close, at the Parthenon in Athens, of all places. Regretfully, I never got to meet him but only spoke to his wife briefly.",9,1,1,7 August 2008
Twilight," Abercrombie & Fitch vampires
","Mind you I was FORCED to see this film, 'Twilight'. I had no desire to see teenage vampires, followed by the American female tween crowd like sports commentators on ESPN. But when I did see this much heralded film, it was worse than I had anticipated.Anyway, basically, it's a retelling of the Romeo & Juliet story. This time Romeo is a 109-year- old-man lusting after a 17-year-old Juliet. I guess I was the only one offended that some old dude who became a vampire at 17 waits almost a century for his true love. Come on, seriously. This guy waited almost a 100 years to fall in love? Man, and I thought my dating career is a disaster. But needless to say, I am not the audience this move was made for. I sat in on a weekday matin√©e and there were already enough younger girls skipping school to see this cinematic wreck.Because I watch so many movies, I thought I would find something redeeming about this movie. The director is a woman who did the courageous movie, '13', which is a scary film for anyone who has a teenage daughter. This blows away 'Lolita' by miles in the power of a young girl's desires, like a young cobra snake, not knowing the power of its venom. With that said, the directing was malleable. But I thought, this had to be a low budget movie - why? Because most of the scenes take place outside, in the forest. No need to pay extras for those scenes. Additionally, no need to hold back crowds as you film scenes.But the thing that really got under my skin as a film lover is the lack of development of the screenplay. They spent so much time in the protracted, plodding relationship building between the two leads that I was wondering, where is the main conflict? There it is, in the last 10 compacted minutes of the film. Even the danger seemed manufactured. It was as if the producers thought: you know, how do we end this film? The film is based on a series of four books and this is the first one. Still, they really needed to spend more time on the conflict to make the inevitable sequels better than the initial production.To compare, contrast it to the another vampire film based on a book, 'Interview With A Vampire', this conflict is too subtle, along with the whole notion of being a vampire. These are vampires as envisioned by Abercrombie & Fitch, afraid to bare fangs, get bloody, destroy. Apparently they have a pact with the Native American Indian werewolves to keep a peace between them. I am not making this up. Everyone is so bloody nice with great table manners that I was saying enough! Someone BE proud to be a vampire and do some damage. Yes, I was rooting for the bad guys. I guess to maintain an appropriate rating, no viscera was shown, as any other indication that these vampires were remotely dangerous other. The 'vampire' family that is the hub of the film are SO damn nice, I was wondering if they weren't modeled after The Munsters 1960s t.v. series. The father is the local doctor and looks so young, it would make a normal human wonder why such a young guy and wife adopt so many children who are almost the same age in appearance. They could be a traveling Manson brood, clad in J. Crew flannel apparel. And the father is a doctor, requiring him to touch people to examine him. No one ever notices this guy is cold as ice or has no heartbeat of his own?It would be easy to slam this film but I did find the divorced mother character appealing - why? Not because she was out of the loop as a character but because she was traveling with her husband, a baseball player. Having the daughter live with her father as the mother wandered the country seemed the only original part of this story line.This movie is for young girls waiting to meet their own 'Edward', the cool misunderstood rebel obviously based on James Dean, to include the hair. But Edward is 109-years-old. He really needs to get over himself, just like me writing protracted musings about a film not made for me. Did I tell you I was FORCED against my will to see this movie? Just needed to remind you.",1,31,64,3 December 2008
The Happening," 'The Heppening' isn't happening
","I decided to give 'The Happening' a chance this past weekend, despite my reservations that the director M. Night Shyamalan has made a career out of making movies from seemingly Twilight Zone episodes. All we need to complete the effort is Rod Serling's voice narrating with a clear, halting voice to guide the audience through.But what really intrigued me before I went to go see it was reading somewhere that the film had a $58 million dollar budget and was a co-production between Hollywood and an Indian telecom company; they were essentially splitting their costs on this anticipated turkey. You can tell it had low rent production values as well at that low dollar amount. Barely any special effects and everything was outdoors, giving it that two dimensional (read: boring 1950s t.v. effect) feel.Boy, was I ever right, and to be honest, I should have stuck to my earlier assessment that this director is a one-trick pony. Because his last outing 'Lady In The Water' was such a piece of dreck, he knew he had to seek financing money elsewhere, hence the Indian funding.This is where 'The Happening's' director and John Singleton diverge, as a comparison/contrast. Where John hit a grand slam with his first film, as did M. Night with 'The Sixth Sense', John too has seen his films decrease in popularity from his Oscar-winning 'Boyz In The Hood.' But John has chosen a divergent path by becoming a producer and allowing others to direct their own films. Though John's films are still gritty, urban-theme, African-American dramas, he is saying something, and he does not make the same movie twice.Witness all of M. Night's efforts. He says nothing other than he tries to set a mood to encompass the whole screenplay. The studios have wised up to his failing abilities and he may have to rethink of how he can position his next effort because Hollywood is out to make money, not give it away. And not to go down a rat hole, but why do all his movies take place in Pennsylvania? I realize M. Night grew up in Philly but there are other parts of the nation and the world he can film in.Because I am a movie junky geek, maybe you'll take my words with a grain of salt. Get a life, instead of writing blogs! But if you don't believe me, then believe my colleague who sits next to me during the day. She actually walked out of 'The Happening' this past weekend, and the theatre management gave her a movie pass for a different show because she also thought this lame celluloid effort tried to qualify as entertainment.",1,4,10,16 June 2008
