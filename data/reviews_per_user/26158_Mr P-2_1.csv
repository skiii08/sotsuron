"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Not a drag at all
","From the outset, the detailed account of how a man died of a head wound after being overcome from peroxide fumes, you know that this is going to be good.  The acting is fab, the cutting remarks are hilarious and the rendition of Gloria Gaynors 'I will survive' around the campfire is just one of the camp treats in a fantastically funny and brilliantly produced movie. Watch it, it's well worth it!",10,3,5,18 May 1999
