E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Boring and predictable
","This is a movie that I watched so that I know what happens in it. It was quite a demanding task. There are really no ideas in the movie. It is the most basic kind of story; a creature arrives, becomes a friend with a child, then there are some difficulties to overcome and finally the creature has to leave and everyone is sad.The only thing that brings joy in the boring task of watching this is the performance of the then 6 years old Drew Barrymore. She was a very talented actress already as a child. But knowing how fame at early age ruined her life, it is not all joy either.So, now I know what happens in E.T. and I will not watch it again. For someone who likes childish stories and doesn't mind their predictable nature, this may be an entertaining film.",2,5,12,23 July 2017
Brokeback Mountain," Beautifully shot work of art
","What an unusual story for a mainstream movie. And yet a story, that must have remained untold thousands of times. Heath Ledger's performance in this film is exceptional. What an actor we lost when he died so young. No less amazing is the scenery and cinematography. This movie is told visually and by unspoken words. Ang Lee is not called a master for nothing. This is a movie I will watch many times.",10,3,4,23 July 2017
Aliens," Disappointing sequel
","All the suspense of Alien is lost. The almost invincible intelligent predator has been diminished to a mindless beast, slaughtered in masses by Ripley, a corporate jerk and a bunch of military dimwits. The only character with any depth is the little girl Newt, who's lines are the only thing remembered from this movie, and the little first time actress Carrie Henn does a wonderful job with the role. The android character Bishop is also somewhat sympathetic, redeeming the reputation after John Hurt's memorable Kane in Alien. Even if you have seen Alien many times, it is better to watch it again than ruin the whole idea by watching this.",3,13,30,16 October 2015
Seabiscuit," Hollywood movie at it's worst
","This movie was an agony to watch. You always know what's about to happen, and keep watching only because you hope there will be at least some plot twist or surprising event along the way, but no. It goes just as all those other Hollywood sport hero movies and bores you to tears. The script is dull. It just picks events here and there along the time line and fails to create any suspense. Directing isn't all that inspired either. So the story gets just told and that's all.The actors do an OK job considering the circumstances, but can't save the movie. Tobey Maguire even manages to create some depth into the character of jockey Red Pollard, but generally the characters remain paper thin.Usually, when a movie doesn't seem interesting after 20 minutes or so, I stop watching, but this one had been praised so much, that I had to see if there's anything in it. But the longer I watched, the more disappointed I got, and It was relief when the movie finally ended.",2,6,15,1 April 2007
