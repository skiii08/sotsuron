The Ring," A Big Scare
","I must say that I consider myself to be a lover of horror, but much too often, sex and gore is subsituted for real horror and you don't get that feeling of genuine fear in the pit of your stomach.  Not so with 'The Ring'. Never have I seen a film that has affected me so.  The images seem to tug at your subconscious, at the dark things we keep inside.  I haven't been able to close my eyes without replaying bits of the film behind my eyelids. I have slept with the light on since I've seen it, and we can't stop talking about it.  Hands down, it was the best, the scariest, the creepiest, and the most intense horror film ever.  The audience in the theater all gripped their armrests, breathed heavily and felt everything the characters were experiencing.  It was excellent!  But beware.... don't expect to leave 'The Ring' in the movie theater, it will certainly be with you for a long time.",Null,314,378,15 October 2002
