Blade Runner 2049," Deserved more recognition
",After years of no sequel and the idea of a sequel being announced with some love and hate towards it we finally got the sequel we deserved Blade Runner 2049 is how a sequel should be. With amazing visuals and cinematography & great performances from the cast with an intriguing story that really kept me watching. Denis vileneuve has shown in the past he's a competent director with prisoners and Sicario being his most well known but by far this is one of his best films. Hans Zimmer also composed for the film and even though it's spectacular this films need for music is not needed with it at times being so quiet and beautiful the bang from an explosion or step of a foot is just riveting to hear if I'm to be honest but when his music plays it's stunning working so well especially the third act with the final action scene and also the peacfullness of hearing tears in the rain once again in a cinema I highly recommend this film as it deserves more praise though it did from reviewers knowing not many people watched it saddened me to hear as if it got more attention we most definitely would've heard more about it.,10,2,8,31 July 2018
