Alien 3," Alien 3 (SPOILERS!)
","Decent, but dissapointing. The first 2 alien films were great, but this just makes the first two look like the world's movies ever. It is still enjoyable, but there are a few cons with this movie a long with some of the pros. Here is a the plot of the film.Ripley is found sleeping in a ship, and is put in a jail. There was an alien in her chest, which transfers to a dog. The alien explodes out of the dog, and then the alien kills the crew in groups in action sequences. Here are the pros for the movie:<ul><li>Action is decent, and it has some intense moments.</li><li>It is extremely gory.</li><li>It gives us some decent backstory.</li><li>There is a lot of action using the alien.</li></ul>Here are the cons of the movie:
<ul><li>The computer generated alien is laughably terrible looking.</li><li>There are weird and strange looking first person shots of the alien running.</li><li>It is uncomfortably dark for no reason at all.</li><li>The acting is not very good.</li></ul>Overall, this movie is decent, but very disappointing too me because I loved the first 2 alien films",6,1,2,5 March 2020
It," A Really good unfortunatly not scary movie
","This is a great ' Reboot ' To the IT Miniseries, and i really enjoy the movie. The kid cast is great, they all fell like good actors, and the 13 year old kids are relatable to actual Teenagers. Walking into this movie, i was hoping to be scared like everybody else because i love movies, especially when they begin to scare me. Unfortunatly however, this movie was not scary, but that does not make it a bad movie. Here are the best things about the movie.
<ul><li>The kid acting and cast ( Just generally brilliant )</li><li>A Masterful tone of dread and suspense.</li><li>Some actual Decent Comedy</li><li>Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd's acting for Pennywise was brilliant</li></ul>All of these are what boosts the movie to being great, and a lot of fun in both entertainment and a bit of dread and suspense. The movie is a little bit dark, especially as this movie opens with a kid getting his arm bitten of by pennywise. Here are a few flaws to the movie in my opinion.
<ul><li>A Few scenes which are unnecessary, which drags the movie to other 2 hours. In my opinion, this movie should be about 15 or 10 minuites shorter than it really is.</li><li>The CG Jerk towards the camera used in some of the scenes with pennywise.</li></ul>Overall a great movie which is rewatchable and also just amazing.",8,0,0,28 March 2020
Alien: Resurrection," So goofy and over the top it is Great
","In my opinion, all of the alien movies are good. This one in my opinion is kind of uneeded. This movie has such stupid ideas that i think that it is a very entertaining vieweing, espicially if you have your funny joke cracking friends with you watching it. Here are the pros for this movie:
<ul><li>It picks a decent pace to the story, and it was mastered excellently for the specific parts of the story.</li><li>The action parts of this movie is thrilling, most specifically the underwater scene.</li><li>Entertaining gore and some very good deaths.</li><li>Some terrifing ways of portraying the power of the Aliens.</li></ul>And here are the Cons for the movie:
<ul><li>The CGI Aliens do not look very impressive, and seem laughably bad.</li><li>The goofy parts at times seem to be a little to over the top for me when it comes to this specific movie.</li><li>IT IS CALLED ALIEN RESURRECTION BUT HAS 12 ALIENS!!!</li></ul>",8,0,1,13 March 2020
Alien," Alien ( SPOILERS! )
","This movie is really entertaining and creates slow burning tension from the beginning of the movie. Although when explaining the first 40 minutes of the film it may seem boring, but although it starts of slow, it is still great and defiantly is worth it.The plot of this movie is that after crashing and exploring a planet, they get back on the ship and someone has an alien strapped to their head. It explodes out of his chest, and then the alien hunts down each member one by one.
Here are the pros for this movie:
<ul><li>It has immediate tension, and creates a very good atmosphere.</li><li>It has the tension and the feeling of a grisly amazing classic film.</li><li>It has suspense when the alien begins to get in the plot</li><li>Brilliantly executed action.</li><li>Impressive old special affects And has lots of fun.</li></ul>I do not find any cons with this movie, but it is still not amazing because I just do not really fine enough amazing things to give this a 10/10. Nether way, a burning great classic and will never become old, it will always be loved",8,0,1,5 March 2020
Predator," Not as good as the Alien movies
","It is a very fun movie, and has many ways in having great action sequences, a colourful cast and everything which you would find enjoyable about a action thriller suspense movie. Here are the pros for this movie:

Aliens," Aliens ( SPOLIERS! )
","I would like to watch this movie more than Alien because this movie has tension all from the Beggining of the movie. There is a lot more action with the alien this time and it infact has more than one alien. this movie introduces the alien queen who creates some amazing scares. this is the plot of the movie.After ripley realises she needs to get back onto the planet and kill the remaining aliens she gets a team and they are all trained to kill the aliens. They are trapped on the planet as the aliens attack them from each direction and they find a girl who was living in the place who help out all of them with the aliens. Here are the pros of this movie:
<ul><li>The final scare of the alien queen ripping the person apart was amazing.</li><li>Just like the original this movie has slow burning tension.</li><li>This movie has scares of the alien and the new updated gore</li><li>It is intense and is just generally a lot of fun.</li></ul>Just like Alien there are no cons of this movie",9,0,0,5 March 2020
