The New World," Just another love story
","Though the movie is not bad by any means, it could have been easily set in fifty other historical situations and came out with the same effect. The love story leaves the viewer bored and the seeming emotionlessness of the characters creates a sense that the two main actors didn't take their roles seriously (Pocahontas certainly seemed emotional until a certain point, while Smith seemed to feel as if she could have been any harlot he could have had on the streets of London). Bale does seem compassionate but also seems to be a little apathetic. The lack of dialogue and explanation leaves the viewer wondering both why the characters acted how they did and at times what even happened. The soundtrack is generic, bland, unmemorable and sometimes out of place, which would not be such an offense if the movie had not had such a focus on emotion and surrealism.Historical inaccuracies are not excessive, but the portrayal of the natives is downright offensive - jumping around and using war cries at inappropriate times as if to portray them as monkeys. Again, the lack of explanation makes it appear as if the natives did not actually help the settlers through the winter or help them with their crops. The shift from downright militancy between the groups to a leader allowing himself to be taken across the sea with only one of his tribesmen is unexplained, as well.The movie is not without positive aspects, however. The scenery is beautiful and historically accurate, though some of the settings are unexplained in the context of the plot (i.e. it is unexplained why certain people went / lived here or there). The directing is dynamic and generally flows nicely together, and John Smith's communal attitude toward his direction of the colony is accurately portrayed.I gave the movie a '6' because it was regularly confusing, sometimes drawn out with unnecessary scenes, the soundtrack was pedestrian, the movie didn't make you care as much for the characters as you should have been able to and the portrayal of the natives was surprisingly condescending.I would suggest seeing this movie if you want to see a love story and are fairly interested in Jamestown and Pocahontas, but be warned that the historical content basically stops halfway through where the characters' dull emotions start to take the stage.",6,1,5,25 January 2006
