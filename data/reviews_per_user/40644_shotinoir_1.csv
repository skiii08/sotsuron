Come and See," Powerful Story Telling
","Come and See is an intense film experience that focuses upon a young boy's transition from naive youth to hardened war survivor. Elem Klimov directed this piece and imbues it with enough visual propensity to compete against such epic World War II films as Schindler's List. Yet Come and See takes the viewer into closer proximity, integrating the observer within the Byelorussian villagers midsts as they are systematically terrorized and slaughtered by the Nazi regime. The film maker also utilizes a powerful sound design to mimic the effect of a bomb blast on unprotected ears and forces the audience to watch as a mass of people are slowly annihilated, ensuring that film going audiences for years to come will understand the horrors that arise from wars waged on nefarious grounds.",9,1,1,13 December 2011
