Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I thought Phantom Menace was fantastic.
","I waited for EP1 for 16 years and thought it was fantastic. The special effects are totally unmatched ever in any movie, the music is very powerful and makes scenes even more real and intense, the characters are believable and the deepness of the plot is right in line with the Trilogy. GREAT plot and story line just like the Trilogy. Clean, exciting, and interesting, with a very deep and captivating sub-plot, and enough humor and excitement to keep small children entertained throughout. I think it's a fantastic movie and a great addition to the Saga. Now I'm even more excited about EPII & III because of TPM and How good it is. And best of all, TPM didn't stoop to gore, swearing, sex, or other smut like titanic and other blockbusters did to get ratings. Phantom Menace is a massive success based on its content, not it's shock value. You can your kids to see it your first time and not be worried about what they see or hear. A blockbuster you can take your kids too and not have to cover their ears or eyes for risk of them picking up things you don't want them too see or hear. Great movie.",10,0,0,18 June 1999
Spider-Man 2," Better than I thought
","It was great. Got to go see it the opening Wednesday night, and it was really great. Better than I hoped it would be. It's nice to be able to go see an action adventure movie and not have it spoiled by the typical tired and obligatory sex, vulgarity, and graphic violence. It's especially nice having a movie of this type that's a fun action film and knowing I could take a child to see it and not have to worry about them seeing and hearing things that aren't appropriate for them to see. I wouldn't take a kid under 7 or 8 to see it though since they definitely have no concept of reality vs. fiction, depending on the individual child of course. It was a great movie, can't wait to get the DVD and see the next one and the ones after that when they come out!",10,0,0,14 July 2004
