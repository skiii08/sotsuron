50 First Dates," If you liked 'Groundhog Day,' 'Finding Nemo' and 'There's Something about Mary,' you might like this
","Imagine if Bill Murray's character in 'Groundhog Day' fell in love with Dori from 'Finding Nemo' and the story being written by the Ferrely brothers, then you'll pretty much have the plot to '50 First Dates.' The basic story is endearing, but the crude humor and stereotypes (the patients with brain damage, the sexually ambiguous zoo worker, the obese and emotionally volatile Hawaiians, the goofy hippie) are annoying and even offensive and do detract from the film. Adam Sandler's transition from Lothario to devoted family man is not explored to a satisfying degree and Sean Astin gives an especially disappointing performance, especially after coming off great roles in the 'Rings' trilogy and 'Rudy.' SPOILER ALERT: To this film's credit, there is no miracle cure for Lucy. She has to live with her condition as do her loved ones. Her family's ability to care for her with grace and endurance make this film a true love story. For those who saw 'The Wedding Singer' and are worried about seeing a rehash needn't worry. The characters and plot are dissimilar enough from that film.",5,1,2,26 May 2005
