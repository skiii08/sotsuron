Casablanca," If you want to get something out of this film, you have to pay attention!
","Although this film is very famous for the time period and is still enjoyed and relevant today, there are aspects of the film that the viewers will not understand or appreciate unless they are truly paying attention, watch the film multiple times or a briefed on what to expect beforehand. On my second time watching the film, I picked up many subtly elements that truly improved the overall feel of the film that I did not see when I watched the film many years ago. The dialog that the characters use is also very realistic to the time period so is not necessarily easily understood by viewers from this century. The characters also speak very fast and can be quite often hard to understand. Despite these few caveats, Casablanca ultimately does not disappoint. The film features many different special effects that were previously not seen in this way in the film industry and also has an exciting plot which draws the viewer into the film, as long as they can keep up with the 'lingo'.",7,0,2,9 March 2016
Citizen Kane," Certainly Lives Up to Its Name
",I've heard about this film over the years and decided that it was one of those classics that I just had to see. And I have to day that I was not disappointed. This film was truly exciting every minute I watched it. The cinematography and acting were both outstanding and Welles did very well as the director in overseeing all of this. The lighting is what really made this movie. It did very well in complementing the personas of the actors and actresses on screen and truly made the film that much more enjoyable. I can also say without a doubt that the sound in both the effects and the way the characters were heard helped the audience to gain a greater enjoyment and understanding of what is truly a work of art.,9,2,3,11 May 2016
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Exciting Film that keeps you guessing
",I didn't expect to be so enthralled with excitement in this film. The title of this film doesn't make it quite clear what you are supposed to be expecting out of it. I was very surprised to see that this film was a thriller and one that kept me guessing in fact. The cinematography in addition to the quick edits made in the editing process after shooting only helped to keep my interest throughout. The sound also helped to intensify the tense moments when you weren't too sure whether the main characters were going to make it. I would recommenced this film to anyone who is looking for a great movie that will keep you guessing and an ending that you will not expect!,7,1,1,11 May 2016
Taxi Driver," Interesting Film
","This film takes a little while to get exciting. However, the cinematic elements present throughout make it very much a work of art. The camera-work throughout the whole film is fantastic. I especially appreciate the dolly shots that were took when the taxi was moving. They were done in such a way that the viewer would believe this is actually what they would see if they were to look outside the window of a moving taxi in a busy city. The sound for this film was also very realistic. The sound engineer managed to accurately capture the essence of a busy city without taking away from the character dialog.The lighting in this film also helped to solidify the location and make it more realistic in terms of what viewers may experience if they were to be in the shoes of the actors and actresses.",7,0,2,12 May 2016
Annie Hall," Weird Movie
",I found this movie to be very confusing and hard to follow. There were parts that were humorous but I ultimately had a hard time grasping the plot. The cinematography was ultimately well done because I could see everything that I was supposed to on screen. Everything was well lit as well so I suppose you could say that the lighting made a difference. The sound including the background noise definitely helped to keep the audience interested at the very least and kind of gave the audience a clue as to what was happening in case they were a bit confused. I wouldn't recommenced this movie to anyone unless you feel that you will able to truly grasp the point and understand the intensity that is happening throughout the film.,4,0,2,11 May 2016
Singin' in the Rain," Be Warned: This is a musical!
","I can't say this is one of my favorite movies. I'm not a huge fan of musicals so I did not have very high aspirations for this film. I thought that the plot would be a little more exciting so that caused me to loose focus and therefore ultimately not like the film. The only saving grace for this film was that the characters were moderately funny which made it relatively enjoyable and kept my interest until then end. The cinematic elements of this film were very strong but I think the most effective was the light and obviously, since this is a musical, the sound. The light really gave the film that movie studio look that the production staff was looking for. The movie sounded good overall and those who have a greater appreciation for music could certainly find a loathing for the way the sound was implemented in the film.",5,1,4,11 May 2016
Pulp Fiction," Wildly Exciting
",Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that has gone down in history for the way it looks on screen and the messages sent throughout the course of the film. The film wouldn't be so eerily brilliant if it weren't for the lighting effects. Sometimes the faces of the character's are 1/2 lit or lit in a different way which really helps bring the concept of being in the shadows to the screen and it manages to make that more of a profound impact on the viewers because the person doesn't look normal or like they should. Another technique that was used very well in this film was the actual film making itself. The subjects were filmed in such a way that they complement the lighting effects but still make them visible for the audience to understand what is going on in the story.,8,1,2,12 May 2016
To Kill a Mockingbird," One of my alltime favorites
","There are not enough good things that I can say about this film. Every time I watch it I think it gets better and better. The acting is certainly spot on and every actor and actress that was cast certainly owned the character they were assigned. The cinematography had to be the best part of this film. It really focused where the action was making it easy for the viewers to see the action or keep them in suspense until later on in the movie. The lack of light in some parts of the film also helped to heighten this film's intensity. As someone who has also read the book, I am surprised at how some of the cinematic characteristics have stayed true to what was written in the book.",10,0,1,11 May 2016
