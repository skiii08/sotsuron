Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Really Enjoyed This
","I'm a movie buff, I love them more than sports. I watched this with my buddy and we are both fans of the originals (3rd was ify but still watchable) When I heard they were making a 4th i was like smh... but even though i had low expectations, i still had to see the movie. Im glad i did. The story line is actually pretty good,in a way beautiful. They are searching for the fountain of youth, and the adventure to get there is very entertaining. The side story with some other characters is very good! It was almost as if you were watching a love story unfold.Solid score, makes you feel for the characters. Is this epic? Ehhh in some ways, I feel its more 'adventure.' Johnny never disappoints in his roles so no need to talk about him. Cruz is attractive and does her part well.Overall, impressed. I wont be surprised to if there is a 5th. My guess, there will be.",8,0,1,12 December 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Intense, epic and a great conclusion
","From the opening scene to the end you are in Christopher Nolans hands. Man does this guy know how to direct a movie. Truly people do need to study his style in film school. Lets start with Bale, what a performance. Hes the beats every other Batman performance by miles. Wasn't quite on my radar until DK series appeared and I have a lot more respect for him. How about Ann? AMAZING. She played her part perfectly and showed she could take on such a challenging role. I really didn't think she would pull it off but she exceeded my expectations big time. I plan on taking her more seriously.J.L.G did great and proved he can take on big roles. He is no stranger to Nolan and they work great together. How does Nolan know how to pick out such great actors for his films? He literally is a genius and puts to shame all these 'Hollywood' movies. He has heart and passion and he shows you that through his films. Overall, this isn't just a movie, its a spectacle. Truly indulge yourself into this movie and it will overtake you on the ride of you life. Action, Plot, Character. It has them all and so just enjoy this and you will in no way be disappointed.",10,6,13,15 October 2012
