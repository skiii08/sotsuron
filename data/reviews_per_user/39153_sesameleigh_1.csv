Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," It's Appalling...
","how many of us can't take the truth. the viewers who rated this film disgusting and a waste of time choose to not see the forest for the trees. are they as duped as the unsuspecting participants in the film? that's the problem: too many of us Americans take things at face value. we either don't make time to see the truth or choose to throw their hands up and deny they are part of a culture that in some places still fosters racism and hatred. ultimately, Cohen isn't even targeting Americans. he's targeting cultures past and present, Europeans and Americans alike who feel superior to others. sure- his style is brutal and offensive at times. but so is the truth.this film is art. it was gut splitting humor as well, but it was relaying a critical message. it's a piece of work that reflects our culture's place in time politically and socially. if you want a mindless laugh, watch an adam sandler film. they are always sympathetic to the viewer and never evoke too much thought about ourselves.",10,40,51,25 October 2007
