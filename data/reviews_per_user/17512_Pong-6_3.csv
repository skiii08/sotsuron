Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A worthy addition
","Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace was released in the theaters on May 19, 1999.  I saw it in the theaters 12:01 AM on May 19.  And since I lived on the east coast, I was among the first ones EVER to see this movie in the theaters.This movie is great.Someone once said, 'You don't watch Star Wars movies, you experience it.' This was an experience.  The visual mastery of the first three movies, the raw human emotions flowing through the futuristic machine world, and wonderful characters with subtle complexities; they are all faithfully represented in this latest edition, or addition to the legendary obsession.Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi master played by Liam Neeson, is fantastic, projecting an image of imposing aura filled with a hint of rebellious wisdom.  He's one of the central characters in this movie and a fantastic addition to the Star Wars crew.Anakin Skywalker, the other central character played by a 10 year-old actor Jake Lloyd, was so lovable and plucky that I almost forget about Anakin's future. He also showed the ambition and genius that foreshadowed his impending fate as the Dark Lord of the Sith.The real star of the story, of course, was the visual experience, ranging from mystical underwater world, gigantic sea monsters, a palace eloquently crafted out of Italian marble, an epic battle made entire out of computer graphics, a battle involving swarming spacecrafts, and of course, a light-saber duel.  They were shot with the George Lucas's wonderful vision and direction, resulting in the best looking film EVER.Like I said, this movie is great.",8,0,0,21 May 1999
Being John Malkovich," Being artsy for the sake of being artsy is just stupid
","I am against pointless movies.  If a movie doesn't have a message, it is pointless.  Entertainment without morals is the central idea behind hedonism.  And for the mature viewer, this movie failed to make any profound points.  It just tries to be weird and different for the sake of being weird and different. It was not funny; it was not shocking; it was just plain stupid.",6,0,1,24 August 2000
Braveheart," This movie changed lives
","'Ay, fight and you may die, run and you'll live. At least a while. And dying in your beds many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom?'Was there ever a greater call to battle?",10,3,5,24 August 2000
