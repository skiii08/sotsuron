Spartacus," A Truly Great Sword and Sandal Epic
","Spartacus is probably the best of the sword and sandal movies of this era. The film is taut, thoughtful, well-acted and not overly long. There is equal measure of action, love scenes, and Roman political intrigue; therefore the film doesn't bog itself down in any one area or cliché as some of these epics do. This makes Spartacus a well-balanced movie that is really watchable.Great sets, great costumes and great actors compliment a brilliant script. The film is very well produced and effectively directed. The fight scenes are extremely absorbing - especially the fight-to-the-death pairings watched by Crassus (Lawrence Olivier), Glaborus (John Dall) and the Roman ladies; the love scenes are touching (first time around anyway); and the scenes of political intrigue in Rome are an excellent off-set to the plight of the gladiators.By including the political scenes, Kubrick added a tremendous depth to Spartacus. The political play-off between Crassus (an optimate), Caesar (a populare) and Gracchus (head populare) add a great historical flavour to what was going on politically in ancient Rome at the time, and help no end to take the weight off the 'fighting for freedom' motif of the film. These scenes also provide us with a great subplot involving Gracchus (Laughton) and Bataiatus (Ustinov). The research for these scenes was done well, and the script is very intelligent, incisive and sharp.The film fails in some areas though. The good versus evil motif was clearly intended as American Cold War era propaganda. Note the monologue at the start of the film which states that Spartacus was dreaming of an end to slavery 'forty years before the coming of Christ' and '2000 years before slavery would end.' The monologue infers that Christianity does not favour slavery, but freedom. This was not the case in the ancient world - bishops kept their own slaves, and Jesus Christ and St. Paul themselves do not denounce slavery, but instead use it as a metaphor for being a 'slave of god.' To the early Christians, and Jesus Christ, the social position you held in life was not important, what was important was if you had been a good person and served your master well, for it was the afterlife which counted.It was also impossible for someone in the ancient world to envisage a world without slavery. Spartacus would not have had the slavery-free world of our own, in which freedom is a right and not a privilege, to compare his own to. Slavery had always been a normal, intrinsic part of ancient society. Slaves may not have liked to be kept prisoner, but they would not have been able to comprehend a world in which such a condition did not exist. This heavy-handed aspect of the movie is an American manufacture - creating a protagonist and antagonist situation to suit the times in which the film was made.Nonetheless, this is a minor quibble that can be overcome by the merits of the rest of the movie. Spartacus is a finely crafted outing that takes the audience along in an involving and sweeping story that is well-acted, well-scripted and which takes the trouble to add a good amount of depth to its otherwise engrossing subject matter. A solid 9/10.",9,1,3,23 January 2005
A Bridge Too Far," Long, Boring, and Generally Badly-Handled
","This is a very waterlogged war film, notable today only for its mammoth star line up and for being a rare war film in that it depicts a German victory. The director has attempted to make the film as comprehensive a telling of Operation Market Garden as possible, but has instead (or because of this) left us with an over-crowded and at times heavy-handed mess.The film starts out well, conveying well the war-office politics which, borne out of an arrogant zeal to end the war swiftly, ended up dooming the entire operation. Pointing out sound reasons to delay the launching of the air drop, which would save thousands of lives, was regarded as 'rocking the boat.' Notable was the character of Fuller, who saw the presence of German tanks as a good reason to call off the mission. When he pushed for this, he was forced to take 'some leave' for exhaustion. The mission went ahead - straight into a few German Panzer divisions. Following Fuller's advice (based on sound intelligence), would have saved a few thousand men, and probably the mission; but Allied command wanted the boys home for Christmas, and Fuller was rocking the boat - touché.Indeed there are also some fine battle sequences incorporating great special effects. But these are few and far between in this three hour movie. These good points, including the wonderful cast and a brilliant score, are just not enough to make this film worthwhile as anything but a curio. The rest is all downhill.....The screenplay is simply awful - there is just too much going on in the events which are the subject of the film, and this muddles the movie. Even if you are following the film closely, at times you are left wondering if you've in fact missed something when a quick rewind to recap shows that you haven't. A lot of self indulgent, meandering direction from Attenborough doesn't help the matter either. He also seems to enjoy over-exposing the film in many scenes, so that sunlight glows in a blurry manner, creating a sepia kind of image. This looks terrible, and is reminiscent of some dreadful films by Tony Richardson.The star line up, though magnificent is ultimately unnecessary. It only ends up distracting the audience from the film's plot. Sundry big names appear in totally unnecessary cameos, most of which simply detract from the main plot; this, I feel, adding to the confusion of an already muddled screenplay. Laurence Olivier and James Caan appear in two completely pointless almost-cameo roles. Both the roles are completely beneath these actors, and the pretentiousness of the director to include these scenes (especially Caan's) is clearly evident in their suplerfity. The dialogue between James Caan's character and the field doctor was simply inane, and should have just been cut.The scene towards the end, in which the leading officers of the operation stand atop a bell tower and contemplate why the mission failed, is simply a straight rip-off from the ending of The Charge of the Light Brigade in that each tries to blame some other aspect of the planning which led to their own section failing. The actual final ending of the film was bland, and very heavy-handed. Totally unsatisfying - especially after three hours.And all through the film the national-specific clichés of the characters was abysmal. The two American leads (Ryan O'Neal and Elliot Gould) were just cardboard-cut-out US stooges - cigar chomping, loudmouths always rattling on about 'American ingenuity' and the need 'to try', and wishing to emulate George Washington in battle. The British were no better - if not worse. There was just so much 'Chin up laddy', and 'better luck next time old boy - eh' going on that the film began to play like a parody of a war film; so much so, that by the end of the film you are relieved that the Nazis have won the day - if, of course, you are still awake to care by this stage.This film requires patience, as most films with such run time do; but most other long films have the virtue of being able to hold your attention by providing a solid evening's entertainment. A Bridge Too Far doesn't have this virtue, because it has attempted to crowd too much into its clumsily handled screenplay. It is a worthwhile film for war buffs, as there are a few rewarding battle scenes; but one has to wade through veritable spools of self-important and confusing - sometimes down-right boring - celluloid to get to them. To the casual viewer this is not an enjoyable prospect, and not even the star power of the film can make such a task worthwhile.",5,23,40,25 March 2005
Titanic," A sterile example of post-modernism......
","Well, this certainly put bums on seats. Great special effects, great cinematography, nudity, steamy sex scene, spitting competitions, shoot-outs, and a tragic ending to a beautiful love story - all aboard the S.S Titanic! This makes for, I'd say, the worse of the well-known Titanic movies. It had a much bigger budget and such better special effects, but for extreme lack of sincerity and authenticity it is by far the worse. The producers actually seemed to make an effort - in some parts at least - to include 1990s attitudes into a 1912 setting: note the rude finger Kate Winslet gave to the antagonist while escaping down the lift.Kudos to James Cameron for putting so much effort into building the actual ship from original blueprints and for focusing so much attention on realistic FX, and making the film, in parts, so profoundly historically accurate. But in those parts in which the film was not profoundly accurate, it was profoundly the opposite and disgustingly so. Shame on Cameron for making the focus of the film a soppy, clichéd love story; the kind of which we have seen dozens of times. And shame for making those scenes which were historically and poignantly accurate mere backdrops to this standard and fictionalised love story.But in our times, this kind of lowest-common-denominator love story puts bums on seats and millions forked out to see Winslet and DiCaprio fall in love, ride on the bow, and finally say a tearful, inopportune, goodbye.This is the failure of the movie. It is anachronistic, and the film voids itself off. On one hand, spending millions on accuracy - sets, research, costumes and special effects - will attract many people looking forward to good quality film-making and a solid telling of what happened that night - people who will then be alienated by the no-brainer love story. On the other hand, the assumed target audience of the film who are primarily excited by the love story are those who could not care less about the millions spent on historical accuracy. It is a totally anachronistic situation.James Cameron totally wasted a fantastic opportunity to make a brilliant film on the subject, a film that could have surpassed all previous efforts. Instead he devised a storyline totally entrenched in Hollywood love-story stereotype, of the type that anyone could see anywhere else, and simply set this aboard a historically accurate rendition of the Titanic. He did not understand that the real events alone of April 14-15 1912 were enough to fuel a heart-breaking story of tragedy and bitter irony, and instead he used well-worn cinematic tools to pitch the film at the lowest-common-denominator who can't be bothered thinking outside their own experience. 'Titanic' is just an example of the cultural sterility of our times. The 1958 film 'A Night to Remember' told a more genuine, authentic, touching and historically accurate version of the disaster with half the budget and half the special effects technology, and I think this is testament to the suburban teenage wasteland which is Cameron's film.Still, the film offers good old-fashioned movie-going thrills and spills. It has a classic format against-the-odds love story all. It also has great special effects, and employs intelligent cinematography. So as a form of entertainment, it is a jolly good romp to accompany a bag of popcorn. As a film about the Titanic - which it purports to be - well, this kind of story could have been set anywhere and at anytime. The Titanic merely made a good and exciting setting for the fictional characters involved.This is a bad Titanic film, and as James Cameron was aspiring to make a Titanic film, hence the title, he has failed. As time, the harshest critic of all, marches on the film will be seen more and more as a marketing vehicle of the late 1990s. Other, better, Titanic productions will remain holding their own as honest, accurate and sincere renditions of what really happened that night.Finally, the above-mentioned remarks about the anachronistic nature of the film make it difficult to rate, and hence the love-it-or-hate-it experience of this film. 'Titanic' straddles the ridge between well researched triumph and Hollywood farce with the dexterity of a three-legged elephant....Which ever direction the elephant falls is up to each individual viewer.",1,61,218,15 January 2005
Psycho," If there is one single film that can claim to be THE best of all time, then this is it....
","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*, if there can be in a film as famous as this....Psycho probably has the most famous (and/or infamous) scene in the history of movies - the shower scene. The shower is in the Bates motel, run by Norman Bates, and his 'mother'. Even today, if someone looks freaky, many still say he looks like Norman Bates. If someone has a clingy or naggy mother, many a Norman Bates allusion is referred to. Psycho has become etched into modern culture and become a household name. Why?...because the film was a milestone, not just of gore, but of cinematic effect and technique. Psycho is, all at the same time, taut, mesmerising and terrifying. It is a textbook example of how to captivate an audience, and then shock them right at the very end.The film starts by introducing a love-lorn and frustrated heroine, complete with a dead-end job, and a relationship that needs a jump start. The audience is introduced to her and her troubles; we follow her, and feel for her - then she is murdered right in front of us. The array of characters introduced in the first half of the film - the arrogant 'Texan' guy who flashes forty thousand dollars, the bumbling boss, the suspicious highway cop, the dumbfounded used-car salesman - all amount to nothing. This pioneering change in plot has the same effect as a tree which you collide with after pulling up the handbrake on a speeding car.Then enter Milton Arbogast, the private detective who begins the search for our slain heroin Marion Crane. He investigates the Bates Motel and finds something amiss. He reports the news to the worried boyfriend and sister of Ms Crane - they all develop some trust and repartee. Then he's dead. Then enter the local town cop who doesn't believe the boyfriend's and the sister's suspicions, while all the time the audience knows what really happened and why people are dying at the hands of an 'evil old lady' who the disturbed Norman Bates is desperate to protect.The whole film was a totally new way of writing a plot, and of manipulating a storyline. The supposed lead character is killed early on, a replacement protagonist suffers the same fate; and all the audience are then left with are the utterly desperate and confused Lila Crane (sister) and Sam Loomis (boyfriend), who have only their suspicions and fear to drive them toward finding the truth. The audience feels for them, because we know that Norman's mother murdered Marion Crane.....or at least we think we do.Psycho only runs for around an hour and a half. It is the tautest thriller I've ever seen. Not one scene is wasted on being filler. Each scene is purposeful, powerful, and extremely economical. The pace is cracking when it needs to be, and slow and hypnotic when emotion and fear need to be emphasised; note the long scene as Norman Bates cleans up the murder scene - this allows the horror of what just happen sink in.The script is rattling, with some flourishing dialogue that even overshadows some wooden acting from John Gavin. The cinematography is brilliant, with great use of lighting and shadows. And, of course, the directing is just simply cutting edge, even for today. Anthony Perkins does a perfectly chilling job as the psychotic Norman Bates, and Martin Balsam is a completely natural private eye. And famously, to complement these ground-breaking plot twists, are the chilling and perfectly executed murder scenes.And finally, the chilling revelation of what really happened at the Bates Motel is kept right until the blood-curdling end, and is realised through a ear-splitting scream, a rotting skull, and a naked swinging lightbulb; a scene which leaves the audience shocked, terrified and thrilled after such a roller-coaster of a movie. For those few people to whom the 'spoliers' warning at the start of this piece applies, go and rent this film. It is simply a must for everyone. It is a defining moment of modern popular culture, and as such if there ever was a convincing candidate for the greatest movie ever made title, well then this is it.",10,7,13,6 March 2005
