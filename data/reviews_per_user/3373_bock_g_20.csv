Ford v Ferrari," Standard Hollywood biopic.
","After watching the Best Picture winner, 'Parasite' in the afternoon, I went back to the theater later that evening to watch this film. My expectations were not so high, and I honestly felt a little fatigued from being awed by the South Korean masterpiece I saw earlier in the day. After watching this film, I felt like I just ate a little too much pizza--it was good but it maybe too long. The story is fairly standard and somewhat uplifting, the performances were pretty good (refreshing to see Christian Bale in a British accent), and the visuals were good. However, I felt the climatic race and ending to be anti-climatic. Maybe it's because I'm not really familiar with racing, I kind of expected something more exhilarating like the Podrace sequence from Star Wars episode 1. Now the last moments of the race and the results were fun to watch-personally the film could've ended there. Now the ending, without spoiling too much felt too obligatory and could've just been cut. Sometimes events could merely be mentioned or even be written in the end credits, that's what the ending in this film was like. Overall, good film but not worth a repeated viewing.",7,0,1,16 February 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A 'new hope' for spin-offs and a return to an old faith
","My expectations for this film was less than enthusiastic. Being a fan of the seven films (I never explored the expanded universe or the cartoons)I thought a spin off wouldn't be worth watching in theaters: I was wrong. Having watched this film twice, I came up with two conclusions: it a new standard for spin-offs and its the most faithful to the cinematic antecedent of the original Star Wars. The film takes the vital elements from the original and prequel trilogies (mostly the plot to steal the plans of Death Star) and adds a new layer of depth to the canon--a well balanced spin-off. An ethnically diverse cast (loved the blind master and his sidekick), there is definitely a worldly atmosphere that hasn't been explored in the other films of the canon. Given how simple the plot is, the filmmakers managed to create an engaging story with solid action and characters. Although there are a couple of minor CGI that bothered me (particularly the unnecessary shot of Princess Leia in the last shot, bless you Carrie Fisher), and some dull characters these flaws are a product of the inseparable faith to the chronology of the original film. This brings me to my second conclusion: its faithfulness to the cinematic antecedent. People forget that the original concept of Star Wars was George Lucas' tribute to the old Saturday matinée serials of the 30's and 40's (á la Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers) which were episodic.'Rogue One' (while being a prequel) fits the episodic tone of those Saturday matinée serials: not being to over reliant on the chronology, but having enough elements that keep the series flowing.",9,1,5,1 January 2017
Knives Out," A Good Friday night flick.
","Being one of the few admirers of the much hated 'The Last Jedi', I was excited to watch this film. Mystery films are generally not my cup of tea, but this one was really engaging. The plot was easy to follow, even with Rian Johnson's penchant for twists. The ensemble cast was great, though Daniel Craig's Kentucky accent bothered me quite a bit. Still, I think he's a good comedic actor-despite his irrefutable image as 007. The overall pacing was solid-this is what Rian Johnson is capable of doing if given the right genre and material. A stylish, and entertaining flick for a Friday night.",7,1,2,22 February 2020
Oldboy," An HFS film.
","Since watching the Best Picture winner, 'Parasite' (twice within the same week), I've made a list of Korean films that I need to watch. 'Oldboy' was at the top because I've heard that Tarantino liked it and it was one of the most critically acclaimed films of the 2000's. After watching this film, I was in a trance. The story is based on a graphic Japanese manga. It follows a man who gets kidnapped and incarcerated by mysterious forces, spending 15 years. Through means which I can't describe in words due to the graphic nature, the man comes back to real world but is given a limit by his mysterious captor to find out the reason of his incarceration. Much of this film is filled with surreal imagery, which is also complemented by the editing. It is very violent and graphic-possibly the most violent film I've seen. That being said; it is still a great watch-possibility for a second time",8,0,0,22 February 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Is this real life or is it just fantasy? Caught in the landslide of biopicnosis
","As an average Queen admirer who watches the epic Live Aid performance on repeat and listens to the Greatest Hits album (both part 1 and 2) as a daily routine, my expectations were relatively high when I watched the trailer. Those expectations lowered once I peeked at some of the reviews and audience responses. I live in Japan, where Queen has arguably their most loyal fan base (that should've been mentioned in the film); and are still showing the film in big theaters. I watched the film today, with moderately low expectations, and I walked out of the theater asking myself the opening lines of the eponymous song. Honestly, I felt pretty mixed about this film. The production value was undoubtedly high: all the sets (particularly the Live Aid set) were pretty accurate. Rami Malek's detailed performance of the legendary singer was quite good and so was the other supporting cast (particularly the other band members). Listening to the band's greatest hits in the theater was comforting, but I would have enjoyed it more if the filmmakers used the actor's voices, at least during the live sequences. The most disappointing aspect was the overall narrative botched by all the historical inaccuracies. While I'm not against biopics that take some liberties with the truth for an effective dramatic narrative; this is quite disrespectful to Freddie Mercury and to the band. The two most glaring liberties this film took was Queen breaking up only to reform for the climactic Live Aid performance and the portrayal of Freddie's homosexuality. Although Live Aid was seen in real life as sort of a comeback for Queen as rock gods, I thought the idea of having the band in the film go through the clichÃ©d breaking up-to-come back again plot was cheap. Personally, the climax should've been the recording sessions of Innuendo-that's a touching story of a tight knit band. In regards to the portrayal of Freddie's homosexuality, I understand it's a difficult issue to tackle since very few people knew who he really was in his private life. However, the film portrays Freddie as guilt-ridden and somewhat forced into it by Paul Prenter, his Judas (in real life as well)-that's pretty offensive. What's more disappointing is how both Brian May and Roger Taylor as well as Jim Beach served as producers for this film-which also means that they had authority over the story and facts. It is ironic how May and Taylor fired Sacha Baron Cohen because they felt the biopic should be more about the band rather than Freddie-yet the majority of this film is Freddie. All I can assume is they either didn't know Freddie well enough, or they simply couldn't care less about the facts and were concerned about finishing this project in time. Overall, this film is like listening to The Greatest Hits, but with no appreciation and respect to Queen.",6,1,7,7 December 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man," A reboot that's 'webbed together' pretty well
","'The Amazing Spider-Man' exceeded my expectations. I am somewhat of a fan of the Raimi films and I was just as doubtful as anybody else when I heard that Andrew Garfield was gonna be the new Spider-Man. I saw him in 'The Social Network', he's a good actor; but I didn't expect him to be a better Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire. Having seen this film, Garfield is not only a better Peter Parker, his character is a lot more interesting. The problem I had with Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker was that he was just a good-hearted geek, sort of the generic hero. With Garfield's portrayal, Peter Parker is not just the shy and nerdy outcast, he's pretty street-smart and courageous; the kind of outcast people generally look up to. He has a pretty good sense of humor which is well reflected in the more decently written dialogue than the Raimi films. Not to mention, he's much more of a genius than Maguire's Spider-Man for solving an algorithm (a reference to Eduardo from 'The Social Network' who was also portrayed by Garfield?) that ultimately creates the Lizard and builds his own web. The fight scenes are pretty good, he constantly gets bruised and his superpowers are well portrayed compared to the Raimi films. As one can already assume from the title, the film is certainly more faithful to the comic books but also pays some homage to the Raimi films as well. The supporting characters were well portrayed and were definitely more interesting than ones from the Raimi films. Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy was smart and had some pretty good chemistry with Garfield's Spider-Man. The only flaw in the film was the Lizard. He's the typical mad-scientist with the Jekyll and Hyde-ish approach that's a little reminiscent of the Doc Ock character from 'Spider-Man 2'. The filmmakers definitely could have put more emphasis on Dr. Connors and Peter's father's relationship as well more dialogue between Spider-Man and The Lizard in the end. The only thing that saved the Lizard from being the worst villain is that he's put in jail and will very likely appear in the sequel; which would indicate that there will be some more character development for Dr. Connors. With more realistic characters and dialogue, this film is definitely a good addition to the string of awesome Marvel superhero films that began with 'Iron Man'.",8,1,4,6 July 2012
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's 'American Graffiti'
","Being a fan of Tarantino, my expectation for this film was very high-considering this might be the filmmaker's last directorial outing. Having watched it a couple of weeks ago at the cinema, I enjoyed it. Did it exceed expectations? Not really. Is this Tarantino's best work? Not at all. As many film reviewers have wrote, this is Tarantino's love letter to the 1960's Hollywood. The visuals, down to the small details was brilliantly done. The soundtrack is just as great, like most of Tarantino's work. The performances were all wonderful (including the controversial Bruce Lee and Sharon Tate portrayals). The story moves at a relatively slow pace, following the vignette-style of 'American Graffiti'. There's less violence by Tarantino standards-that is until the last thirty minutes of the film. The satisfyingly gruesome climax was executed very well, and definitely worth the long running time. For audiences that are not familiar with the historical background and context, I suggest you research it before watching the film because the climax won't be as satisfying. 'Once Upon a Time' is Tarantino's 'American Graffiti'-a story that takes place in a transitional phase in history, but served with the right amount of cathartic violence that will be sorely missed from audiences worldwide if this great filmmaker really is going to retire.",8,1,1,20 September 2019
1917," A true cinematic experience
","Continuing my ride on the post Oscar bandwagon, I watched '1917' a couple of days ago. I was excited because Sam Mendes and the great technical crew from 'Skyfall' made it-my expectations were high. Having finished the film, I was truly moved. The one continuous shot illusion really made me feel like I was in the frontlines. The beautiful cinematography by Roger Deakins was smooth, Thomas Newman's score was daunting, and most of all Sam Mendes' direction was truly epic. For a film that's hyped for its technical achievements, I was more impressed by the performances by the actors. Lance corporal scholfield (played by George MacKay) was a great character, I was able to identify with his mixed feelings about going on this detail. The midpoint scene involving his friend's death was probably one of the best acted scenes I've seen in recent years. Overall, '1917' is truly a cinematic experience-go see it on the big screen.",9,0,0,18 February 2020
1917," A real cinematic experience.
","I've watched only a few war films (mostly Vietnam War and maybe one or two WWII pictures) so I can't really compare this to other WWI films. Having just watched this film, I'm glad I haven't watched any of the others because this was quite an experience. Everything about this film was epic-Roger Deakins' smooth cinematography, Lee Smith's seamless editing, Thomas Newman's great score, and Sam Mendes' realistic directing. The concept of a one continuous long shot really fits this film-it really felt like being in the frontlines of a battlefield. The performances, especially George MacKay as Lance Corporal Scofield was captivating. Lance Corporal Blake's death scene near the midpoint was probably one of the best acted scenes I've seen in recent years. It is definitely a cinematic experience that can only be felt by either going to the theater or watching it on a huge screen.",9,0,0,16 February 2020
Midsommar," I wanted to enjoy this film but...
","I haven't watched 'Hereditary' or even the often compared 'The Wicker Man' so I'm not sure if this film is considered scary on that level. Having just watched the film, I felt lost. The first half of the film seemed promising, all the main characters' plot points were set up pretty well and I was pretty invested in it. Once the film starts at the commune, I started to fall asleep-partly because I was tired but it was just too tedious to watch. The gore and graphic scenes just come out of nowhere with not much suspense, and before I knew it the movie anti-climatically ends with the main girl smiling at a burning tent. The cinematography, the unsettling music, and the performances were all good-it's just the pacing and story was just too long. I'd wanna watch it again when I don't feel too sleepy.",6,1,5,27 February 2020
The Artist," Silent nostalgia
","Let me make this one bold statement: 'The Artist' is not a classic. However, it is probably the most entertaining and nostalgic flick I've watched in a long time (I watched this on a 12 hr. flight btw). I haven't watched many silent films, but I could definitely tell it pays tribute to them. The premise is simple: a silent film actor who struggles through the transition to 'talkies' in the Depression-era Hollywood (aka Golden Age of Hollywood). He meets a beautiful young woman (whom he kisses in front of the press)who instantly becomes a star and rode on the new wave of 'talkies'. The contrast between the two characters are nothing fancy, but certainly kept me interested. There was the usual slapstick humor, but it wasn't so obligatory and had kept me quite entertained. The film was shot in color, but was then converted in black and white. The cinematography was fairly good, and certainly emulated some of the old affects pretty well. It's a great reflection of how Hollywood used to make films back in it's 'Golden Age' and is a relaxing film that puts you right into your seat.",8,1,4,3 March 2012
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," An underrated sequel
","Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992) is the sequel to the worldwide hit comedy film, Home Alone (1990) starring Macaulay Culkin. Kevin McCallister (Culkin) is left alone again, but this time he gets on the wrong plane which is headed to one of the coolest but is also one of most dangerous cities in America: New York City. As Kevin realizes he is parted from his family again--carrying his dad's wallet as he was looking for batteries for his tape recording device which caused him to get on the wrong flight as he was following a businessman who was wearing the identical coat to his dad's. In a similar fashion to the first film, he spends quite a luxurious (and somewhat of mischievous) vacation as he tours around New York, checks into the Plaza Hotel using his dad's credit card, and even has a hotel-chaffered limo take him to a giant toy store (like any ten year old's ideal dream of a vacation). His fun time is cut short as one of the hotel concierges (played by the hilarious Tim Curry) mistakenly discovers that Kevin was using a 'stolen' credit card and chases him out of the hotel. Kevin also encounters the two dim-witted burglars from the first film, Marv and Harry (Played by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci respectively) who escaped jail and were planning to break-in to the giant toy store Kevin just visited. Back in Florida (where Kevin's family spend a miserable trip as they are watching another foreign language-dubbed TV show), they get a call from the NYPD as they fly over to New York City to look for Kevin. Kevin befriends a lonely pigeon lady (played by Brenda Fricker) in a similar fashion to the scary-looking neighbor from the first film. Kevin once again, decides to foil Marv and Harry's plan by luring them to another booby-trapped house(his uncle's house under renovation). In the end, the burglars are caught and Kevin reconciles with his family once again. Although this film was financially successful, it received negative critical responses. I would agree with some critics that some of the cartoon-sh slapstick humor was a little too over-the-top; but then again, thats the running gag of the Home Alone films. Despite the unbelievable actions of a ten-year old kid who checks into a fancy hotel, fights off burglars, and scares away the hotel concierge using a gangster film (fast-forwarding the other character's dialog), I still thought that was well done and imaginable for a witty kid like Kevin. Like the first film, it had the moral lesson of not judging people by looks, the importance of family, and the overall gags and jokes that were even better as Kevin is two years older in this film. I would say this film was even better than the first, a staple Christmas classic. If you ever come across the Home Alone series, rent the first two films and you will enjoy those funny laughs that the late John Hughes gave us.",7,0,1,16 November 2010
Rocky," Oscar bait, clichéd, simple, BUT IT WORKS!!!!
","Rocky is without a doubt one of the best American films of all time. The success of this film is not based on the fact it triumphantly won the Best Picture Oscar against great films such as 'Network' and 'Taxi Driver', nor how it revived the whole 'underdog' genre of sports films-- it's the lovable characters. The premise is simple: a local fighter gets a shot at the World Heavyweight title. Rocky is living a near desolate life working as a loan shark for a local mafioso during the day and fighting underground bouts at night. Despite his dodgy appearance, Rocky is a man who has a good moral personality. The subplot in this film is the romance between Rocky and a shy pet store clerk Adrian (Talia Shire). Adrian is an isolated woman treated rather poorly by her brother Paulie (Burt Young)who is Rocky's close friend. One of the best scenes in the film is the dating scene between Rocky and Adrian at an isolated skating rink. It shows how these two characters are complete polar opposites (Rocky is dim-witted but out-going, and Adrian is clever but detached): it's a stereotypical love moment, but it works because we see how much these two characters have developed beyond their assumed social appearances. Another great character in this film is Mickey (Burgess Meredith) who is Rocky's grouchy manager. Mickey is a father figure and mentor who sees Rocky's talent as a boxer, but disapproves of his lifestyle as a loan shark. Another great scene in the film is when Mickey humbly approaches Rocky to be his manager. He talks about how his own boxing career and how it was wasted because he never had a manager. Rocky is reluctant because he was never approached this way for his first few years of his boxing career. He lashes out his ambivalent feelings towards Mickey and eventually accepts his offer. The rest of the film is predictable, Rocky trains hard, he fights, he loses, but eventually triumphs because he was able to go the distance with the Champion toe to toe, and he embraces Adrian at the end. Oscar bait, clichéd, simple, but it works. Not to mention, Bill Conti's amazing score and one of the first uses of the steadicam were also a contributing factor to how great this film is. Sylvester Stallone is constantly labeled by critics and audiences as the macho action star with limited acting skills, but after watching this film, you would believe he is the reminiscent of a young Marlon Brando. His down-to-earth performance and his great screenplay truly earned him the acclaim he got for this film.",10,0,0,3 January 2012
Joker," A milestone in the supervillian genre
","Very few hyped-up films succeed in delivering beyond expectation-'The Joker' is one of them. Right from the opening shot, I was hooked into the character of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) who would later become the Joker. He possesses an unsettling charm that exceeds some of the great anti-heroes in film: most notably Travis Bickle. Nothing is certain in what Fleck does and says-his addicting laughter (which is closer to a clown than any of the previous Jokers) sets him apart from society. His descent into villainy is closer to a vigilante (a lÃ¡ Travis Bickle) than a super villain. His ultimate dream to be in a talk show with his idol (ironically played by Robert De Niro)-a nod to 'The King of Comedy' (1982). There is also a subplot revolving Arthur's mother and her alleged relationship with Thomas Wayne- which is handled very well. Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force, creating a new Joker that rivals Heath Ledger's portrayal in 'The Dark Knight' (2008). Making this Joker into a comedian was a great idea-the aesthetic and the moral dilemmas are portrayed very well. Every scene is built up with a punchline that gives the film my praise for being the best film of this year.",10,2,5,5 October 2019
The Wrestler," An irrefutable masterpiece
","There are several films I come back to watch when I feel down and out--'The Wrestler' is one of them. The story follows Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (played by the legendary Mickey Rourke) a wrestler whose past his prime and is barely keeping his feet together. He fights in small town arenas, gets juiced up on steroids, works at a supermarket in the daytime, and is constantly locked out of his trailer home because he's short in cash. He also has some feelings for Cassidy (played brilliantly by Marisa Tomei)-a stripper who in someways parallels Randy's life. Both characters are like able despite their downsides but unlike 'Rocky 'where everything despite the odds goes fairly well, 'The Wrestler' constantly pins you down with reality. After a particularly brutal and graphic match, Randy suffers a heart attack which almost kills him. Feeling he's past his physical limitation, Randy retires from Wrestling and tries to make amends with his estranged daughter Stephanie (played by Evan Rachel Wood). With the help from Cassidy, Ram is able to reconcile with his daughter. At the same time, Randy reveals his feelings for Cassidy in part to thank her for helping him reconcile with his daughter. Cassidy, despite having mutual feelings rejects Randy's advances in trying to maintain her professionalism. This angers Randy and he promptly goes out to party-eventually causing him to miss his dinner with his daughter. This irreparably breaks up his relationship with his daughter, and things begin to fall apart again. After being somewhat heckled by a customer at a deli counter he worked at, Randy quits his day job and goes back up to the ring to wrestle. Cassidy also promptly quits her job to chase after Randy to have him stop wrestling. She reveals her true feelings, but that doesn't stop Randy from going to the ring. After a heartwarming speech, Randy wrestles but his heart can't take the beatings like before. In a fatal move, Randy leaps from the corner, performing his signature move, the Ram Jam and the film freezes to the credits where Bruce Springsteen's amazing title song plays along. Everything from the performances, the camerawork, the editing, the music, and most importantly the direction is all top notch. While this is unofficially considered a companion piece to 'Black Swan'-I personally think this film conveys a greater message which is that there's always a place where people belong no matter how brutal and hard it can be to live life. This is a masterpiece.",10,0,0,26 February 2020
Parasite," That's entertainment.
","Jumping on the post-Oscar win bandwagon, I went to see this film today. Having heard the near unanimous praise from peers and other reviews, I had high expectations for this film. It was also the first Korean film I watched. The movie starts, and I'm literally glued to my seat-it was very entertaining. The camera movement, the way the characters speaks, the overall pacing, the black comedy tone-everything was just so freshly packaged, I wanted a refill the moment the movie was over. A predominant theme of this movie is the class structure-from a non-Korean's point of view it was quite clear and somewhat tragic to see. If I had one problem with this film, I think some of the class struggle content was probably too overt (especially in the dialogue) and could have been handled more subtly. Despite that, it is definitely a film that deserved all the accolades it received. It is first movie that I watched in theaters where I instantly wanted to rewatch it. Now that folks, is entertainment.",10,11,18,13 February 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdman: Or a raw mess of artistic proportions
","'Birdman' is a rare kind of film for its kind: a raw and flawed masterpiece. The story is quite simple but is told in a narrative that is both consistent and inconsistent. The characters are real (both literally and figuratively) but are not developed enough to the point where an audience can sympathize or connect with. It's a real fantasy land of what people envision the world of show business. What makes the film a masterpiece is its execution: the acting, the cinematography, the set decoration, the sound, and its direction are all top-notch. Many critics call this a satire of show business, but personally the film satirizes the bipolar notion of success and failure of one's life in a nutshell. Michael Keaton's character is not just satirizing himself, he is satirizing human ignorance. Birdman succeeds on a level in which I cannot possibly write about because it cannot be explained.",8,0,3,10 April 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Nolan's Batman finally rises as a solid addition to the franchise
","To begin, I wasn't a huge fan of Nolan's Batman films. I watched 'The Dark Knight' first in theaters four years ago, and I didn't think it was that impressive (except for Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker). Then I watched 'Batman Begins' for the sake of watching the whole trilogy before this film came out and it was just as dull as 'The Dark Knight'. So as you can tell, I wasn't really hyped for this film. But boy did this film change my opinion on the Nolan trilogy. Despite the film being slightly longer than 'The Dark Knight', it kept me on the edge of my seat. The visuals were great, the action sequences were great, and the CHARACTERS WERE INTERESTING. Batman/Bruce Wayne in particular was more interesting than the previous two films because he is at the lowest point of his life. He's secluded and antagonized by the public, his abilities as the charismatic billionaire and Batman has diminished because of the previous events in 'The Dark Knight'. His internal and external struggle is strongly portrayed by Bale. Bane was another interesting villain who possessed the same level of intimidation and charisma as Ledger's Joker. Anne Hathaway's Catwoman wasn't memorable as Michelle Pfeiffer's in 'Batman Returns' but was way more interesting than Harvey Dent or even Maggie Gyllenhhal's Rachel from 'The Dark Knight'. Other supporting casts such as Gary Oldman and Michael Caine gave solid performances. The story certainly had more of the essence of 'Batman Begins' than 'The Dark Knight', but definitely tied the trilogy together very nicely. The drama wasn't draggy and overdone like 'The Dark Knight'. In the end, 'The Dark Knight Rises' firmly establishes Nolan's Batman trilogy and as a solid addition to the Batman film franchise since Tim Burton's 'Batman'.",10,2,5,21 July 2012
Jojo Rabbit," It's a really cute story-in the most artsy way possible.
","Mixing emotional drama with light-hearted comedy is nothing new-it's been done to death. Especially WWII stories. I personally have never watched 'Life is Beautiful' or any other films of that blend but I can kinda picture how the story goes along. 'Jojo Rabbit' does not move along in that direction. The majority of the film is light hearted and comical (with dashes of drama in between), until Jojo (played with great charm by Roman Griffin Davis) loses his mother (played brilliantly by Scarlett Johansson). As much as this film is about humanity and the effects of war, it's ultimately a coming of age story. Jojo grows up, he even kick's his imaginary Adolf Hitler (played by the writer-director of this film) out of the window. All the performances were great, the lines are all funny, and the use of music was really spot on. It was really worth going to a theater farther away from my house.",8,0,2,12 March 2020
Green Book," Heartwarming
","This film has gotten a lot of bad press from the historical inaccuracies to it's controversial win for Best Picture-I have to admit I did buy into some of that press. Despite that however, the audience reaction seemed to be very positive (at least in Japan)-several of my friends recommended the film to me. So, with slightly low expectationsI I finally watched the film last night-it was pretty good. The performances (especially by Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali, and Linda Cardellini) were wonderful, the story was very heartwarming, and the music (both the score and soundtrack) were solid. Was it worth the Best Picture? Not really, far from the best, but I don't think it was an outrageous decision either. One of the controversies was the depiction of race- such example is apparent when Don Shirley, a high-brow black man embraces the low class stereotypes in the latter half of the film. I personally thought it worked in the film because the friendship and trust between the Tony Lip and Don Shirley changed the two men-both embracing something new. It's a typical buddy, road trip movie, not a historical epic like 12 years a slave or The Color Purple. Some critics and haters called this Driving Miss Daisy 2, I completely disagree because it does this film does provide a fresh take (A white working class man chauffeuring a black and gay musician) on the Roadtrip genre. It's worth the watch!",8,1,2,14 April 2019
