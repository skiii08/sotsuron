Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Mostly different from the book
","I am giving this movie a 5 out of 10 because it was halfway completed in regards to story. While I realize that there are too many elements in a book to include in a full length movie, the results here are ridiculous. Main plot elements are both entirely removed or rushed for no reason. I do not understand the reasoning behind this. The book had a captivating story that tried to fit elements of Lincoln's past to make the story more believable. This movie didn't even attempt to do the same. Instead we have new/unnecessary characters and new plot elements that leave you wanting to rip your hair out. I would say it is worth a rental for the book lovers but take the story you grew to love with a grain of salt as this is not the painted picture I hoped it would be.",5,6,14,23 June 2012
