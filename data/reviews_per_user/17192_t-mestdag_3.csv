Child 44," Soviet Union and Cold War Made Interesting
","This is what this movie did for me, it made a subject which had never caught my eye before and through a more than common one(a serial killer) made it interesting, not to mention the stellar cast, especially Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace.I learned to respect what the common people of Russia went through back in those days and this, in my case anyway, was only made possible because of the thriller element in the movie, which is a sort of movie I've always loved.So, if you've never been particularly interested in what took place in that era in that part of the world, now you have a good 'excuse' to be.",7,1,3,28 August 2015
Split," Didn't get this one at all...
","M Night Shyamalan has made great movies in the past, namely 'Signs', 'The Sixth Sense' and even 'Devil'. But this one, I simply didn't get it. Meaning by the end credits I simply hadn't understood the movie at all.Was there a purpose or a message to this movie? If so, what was it? It wasn't even that entertaining. It starts promising with the abduction of three girls at the beginning, from then on it spirals from promising to down right senseless.Come on, M. Night, even 'The Village' was better than this. What puzzles me is the gigantic grossing this movie has made, coming from a small budget. Give it a try, but judging by what I've seen and a lot of other reviwers, this isn't, by a long shot, one of M. Night's best works.",5,0,7,3 May 2017
Wonder Woman," Man Of Steel Has a Female Equivalent
","After watching this great action movie, I don't understand why so many reviewers gave it such a low rate. This movie, to me is like the female equivalent to Man Of Steel. I loved it, and so did I love Man Of Steel.Gal Gadot does a very fine job as a cool Wonder Woman and Chris Pine gives the movie a lighter touch which it sort of needs most of the time, a bit of humour. The story makes sense from the start of the movie when the queen of the amazons explains their origins. From the moment Chris Pine's character appears on wards the movie sort of takes off(no pun intended). The finale was good enough, nothing too surprising, but surprising enough and well done.All in all, a great block buster, do yourself a favor and watch it.",7,1,5,30 August 2017
