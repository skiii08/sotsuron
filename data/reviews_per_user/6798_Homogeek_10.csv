Walk the Line," 2005's 'Ray'
","The life of Johnny Cash and Ray Charles have some surprising parallels, Both men grew up in the south, Cash; born 1932 in southern Arkansas. Charles; born 1930 in Albany, GA. Both men lost a brother in their youth; Cash lost his older brother, Jack, in a wood saw accident at ten. Charles witnessed his younger brother's drowning at the age of five. Both have roots in gospel; Cash abandoned gospel early in his career only to go back to it in 1956 with a impromptu jam session with Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Roy Orbison (Carl Perkins was recording a new release. Producer Sam Phillips 'left' the tape running but the session remained in the can for 20 years). Charles brought gospel back in his music in 1954 with 'I got a women' A Gospel-Jazz infusion. Cash battled an addiction to amphetamines and barbiturates; Charles a 20 year battle with heroin. Both men have had careers spanning five decades. Now they have another parallel both have a big budget biopic, post-mortem. Jamie Foxx portrayed Ray Charles in 'Ray' (2004). Joaquin Phoenix takes on the man in black in 'Walk the Line' (2005). This is an Oscar bid from Phoenix, and he does a very good job as Cash, however I think Reese Witherspoon does a better job as June Carter Cash, Johnny's life long love and second wife. Robert Patrick (the bad Terminator in T2) plays Cash's father, Ray Cash. After the death of John's older brother, Ray Cash actually tells his ten year old son 'the devil took the wrong son!', a chip that he holds on his shoulder for most of his son's life. Art direction was on target, I really felt I was looking back in time, costume design 100%. My disappointment was to find out that out of all the Cash songs that were featured; my personal favorite 'A Boy Name Sue' was not included. Phoenix has one ace up his sleeve and he is hoping it has Oscar written all over it: he and Reese Witherspoon sang all vocals themselves (Jamie Foxx was lip synching). Phoenix and Witherspoon may be unaware of 'Beyond the Sea' (2004), Kevin Spacey's Biopic of Bobby Darin, Spacey did all the vocals as the lead character and the film went un-noticed by the academy.",9,0,0,13 March 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," 'Narnia' is LOTR for the junior high crowd.
","A film with that is a special effects palooza, in strange fantasy world, with a core group of height challenged heroes; it is 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' right? Well 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe' share more then a title that is so wordy neither cannot fit on any marquee. The film starts out in London during a WWII bombing. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sent off to live in the country stately mansion of Professor Kirke. During an exuberant game of hide and seek, Lucy (the youngest) hides in an ornate wardrobe. Lucy discovers the world of Narnia and befriends Mr. Tumnus, a Faun (a man with a goat's anatomy below the waist). Narnia is in a 100 year winter by the designs of the evil White Witch that has crowned herself queen of all Narnia. Lucy ends up bringing back her siblings and they learn of a prophecy that has four humans (two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve) that are to topple the Queen. The Queen must kill the four-some to continue her reign. The Queen mobilizes her army (that looks not-so-surprisingly like the legions of the Orcs from LotR). The last 45 minutes recreates the battle in 'LotR; The Return of the King', but with almost no blood (Narnia is PG, Return of the King was PG-13). Both films find a 'lost and forgotten' army to save the day. The picture's special-effects blend animal bodies and humans torsos on numerous occasions and seamlessly. Additionally there are talking animals all over the two and half hour movie. There are a couple of blue-screen backgrounds that were notably not up to par but all in all a top quality show.",7,0,2,13 March 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Brokeback Mountain Soars
","In all of the thousands movies I see there is usually one common theme. Be it Jolie with Pitt or Crowe with Zellweger it is all 'boy meets girl'. Brokeback Mountain is a 'boy meets boy story'. There are plenty of gay centric movies that are released direct to video, however direct to video does not have the budget of a big picture or are as well done. And they certainly do not have a career performance that Heath Ledger gives in Brokeback Mountain. The movie starts out in 1963 with Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), a rodeo cowboy wannabe; and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger), a man of very few words, as they get summer jobs herding sheep. They are to take the herd of 3,000 sheep to the highlands for the summer. Some whiskey and the cold mountain night gets both of them in the same tent together. One thing leads to another. Although the sex is pivotal in the movie it is not what the movie is about. The film looks at the men's relationship as it evolves over years. There is that uncomfortable period immediately after a one night stand. Ennis states that 'He ain't no queer'. What gets them through this is that up in the mountains there are no one else to turn to and you eventually have to talk. At the end of the summer they say goodbye, Jack is ready to take this relationship further but Ennis is engaged to Alma (Michelle Williams) and he has no intentions of leaving her at the alter. Ennis does marry, as does Jack, they have families that grow. After four years apart, Ennis finds Jack has sent him a post card. Ennis replies with 'Hell yeah'. We check in with Jack and Ennis several times over the next twenty years. We see the years pass in the fashions and as their children grow up. Jack and Ennis establish a 'fishing trip' two to three times a year to return to Brokeback Mountain. The fishing trips comes at the cost of Ennis's marriage to Alma (he never brings home any fish), but it is something that Ennis can not give up. In 1963 Wyoming, two men just cannot live together with out raised eyebrows. Ennis recounts two 'bachelor' ranchers in the community that he grows up in. After years together the 'bachelors' were the local scandal. One year when Ennis was eight, a group of the local boys decided to teach the 'bachelors' a lesson by torturing them, literally, to death. Ennis's father forces him and his brother to view a tortured corpse and it leaves a lasting impression on Ennis. Ennis pays this cost but not alone, he loves Alma but cannot commit to their marriage. Alma loves him but cannot live with his 'fishing trips'. Jack loves him but Ennis cannot accept that lifestyle. Ennis's Children also pay when he and Alma divorce. Gyllenhaal did a fine job as Jack Twist; It is Ledger's Ennis Del Mar that is amazing (could this be the same Ledger from 'A Knight's Tale'?). Ledger takes the role of a man that has not much to say and speaks volumes. Ledger shows how Ennis struggles with every short sentence. If Ledger fails to take home the Oscar, it will be yet another tragedy.",10,16,18,13 March 2007
Corpse Bride," Dejavu
","I first want to say I was really hyped to see this movie. Half way through the flick a skeleton does a song telling the tale of the Corpse Bride. The tempo of the song was so familiar but could not place it. I now realize it was Mr. Oogie Boogie's song from 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (one of my favorite films of all time). Once I realized this everything started to unravel. The similarities of Emily (C.B.) to Sally (T.N.B.C.), Scraps the dog (C.B.) and Zero (T.N.B.C.), the Town Crier (C.B.) and Hallowtown Mayor (T.N.B.C.). I still thoroughly enjoyed Corpse Bride, I just feel like I saw summer repeats during fall premier week on network television.",7,0,1,13 March 2007
Dreamgirls," A mosiac of Motowners
","Having never seeing the Broadway musical I went in to Dreamgirls understanding it is loosely based on the Supremes. It is better stated that it is loosely based on a mosaic of Motown artists. I saw pieces of the Supremes, Diana Ross, Ike Turner, James Brown, the temptations and more. It focuses on the rise of three women to the top of pop culture and the cost of the journey to get there. Although the story is fictitious it is compelling. I would be interested on why this is not the story of the Supremes there is certainly the drama in that story. The vocals are top notch, and there is not a week link in the chain. Jennifer Hudson, of American Idol, is a stand out as Effie White. The audience applauded the screen when Jennifers's picture came on the screen during cast credits at the end. I am happy to see that there is something good to come out of the Fox series.",8,0,0,13 March 2007
Batman Begins," Batman's Beginning takes too long
","I am really torn on this one, I am well acquainted on Batman lore, so I expected the beginning to drag but this goes on for half the movie. Things start to move when Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham. It was exciting to see all of Batman's toys fall into place (i.e. the Batcave, the Batmobile, and his costume to name a few) but I still was on the edge of my seat waiting for the action to start.When a movie is remade I have to ask 'What does this adaptation bring other than box office receipts?' Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins brings realism. The idea of Batman is so far out there (a crime fighter with a seemingly unlimited cash flow and access to 'wonderful toys'), that all the characters have to be very grounded. It is apparent that Nolan is committed to this. The villains do not have the flamboyance of previous Batman villains. You will find no hideouts on a perpetual slant, no penguin armies. One of the villains in Batman Begins, The Scarecrow uses only a mask to terrify victim while the victim is drugged.The key to Batman is the villains no one wants to see a two hour movie about Batman catching purse snatchers. At the end of the movie, one of the villains dies in a horrific crash. Could the villain survive the crash disfigured and becomes the vengeful Two-Face? With the obligatory origin taken care of I am hopeful that the second movie will move quicker and be action packed.",7,0,1,13 March 2007
Twilight," Bella is no Potter
","This was an after-school special disguised as a theatrical release. I understand that the books were better but I still have to believe, juvenile. The movie revolves around Bella a 17 year old that just moved to her father's residence in Fork, Washington (a.k.a. the wettest and cloudiest place in the U.S.) and the Cullen family. The Cullens are good vampires – they are 'Vegetarians' as they only eat animals. The bad vampires kill and eat humans. Bella falls in love with a good vampire (well thank God for that) but a baddie has taken a shine to killing her. There has been many spins on vampire legend but this is one of the silliest. Stephenie Meyer tried to do for vampires what J.K. Rowling did for witches, I think she fails. Rowling started with Harry at age 11. Potter fans mature with the books and Potter himself. Meyer has Belle at 17 and ready for an endless life with Edward (Cullen). Edward refuses to turn Bella and wants her to have a long life with him. Apparently Edward has not thought about what Bella is going to do in 10 years and is still dating a 17 year old. In 20 years? In 40 years? Yeah, didn't quite think this one through. I think the second movie will be less successful, since adults will not be looking for the next Harry Potter from this franchise.",2,2,5,4 May 2009
Ghost Rider," February Super Hero Movies :-(
","There seems to be a rule for super hero movies, Good super hero movies are in the summer (Batman Begins, Superman Returns, The X-Men and Spiderman movies) poor ones in February (Daredevil and Elektra). Ghost Rider seems to be a Fence Rider to that rule. Ghost RIder is certainly not in the summer league but is better then its February-release counterparts.Visually the movie is stunning, the Special effects top notch. However the story is good but convoluted. The plot is very dark and the screenwriters threw in a number of dumb gags through out the movie ('my head feels like it is on fire' and drinking a pot of very hot coffee) that distracts from the characters.",6,1,3,13 March 2007
War of the Worlds," Aliens do not mess with Grandma
","Spoiler -Spoiler I was excited about a movie taking a micro look at the invasion of Earth by aliens. Spielberg draws us into the terror of an invasion by focusing on one family's survival. However, one problem the movie had was I never really liked Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) or his son Robbie Ferrier. By the end of the movie Rachel Ferrier (Dakota Fanning) was beginning to annoy me (always screaming at a bad time and strangely silent when some one is looking for her).In Spielberg's version of H.G. Wells' tale the aliens have buried tens of thousands of 10-story 'tripods' (think Star Wars' Imperial Walkers) all over the world million of years ago. The tripods have waited to be 'awaken' by lighting bolts. The aliens ride the lighting bolts down under ground into the buried tripods. In the initial sequence it looked like it was buried 30-50 feet (but lets say 100 feet for yuks), in one of the boroughs of New York. Considering how much we like to dig holes in our planet I find it hard to believe that these enormous vehicles remain undetected all over the world for the millions of years or even for one year. I would have thought Spielberg would have abandoned this approach for the original; it would take up too much film time to explain why the ignorant earthlings have not stumbled upon on any alien vessels yet (which by the way was never explained).While this is going on, everyone is sticking around to see what is going to come out of the ground. It seems more logical that many people would be running the other way, but for the sake of a bloody massacre let's just assume that New Yorkers are fearless.Some one thought up a gimmick of watching the destruction that one of the tripods makes by means of some one recording it with a camcorder, however this was after the electromagnetic pulse that takes out all electrical devices. Spielberg allows this; although the footage that is taken is not used anywhere else in the story and therefore superfluous.Our hero takes his kids out of New York to go find their mother at Grandma's house in Boston. On a New England country side, the military engages the aliens, once again everyone is running towards the skirmish instead of away.The movie changes gears when Robbie Ferrier 'has to see' the battle (again a fearless New Yorker). We are left with Ray and Rachel who end up hiding in an ambulance drivers' (Tim Robbins) basement. I am OK with this, the movie comes down to a very personal level of cat and mouse. The aliens eventually take Ray and Rachel prisoner and we find out that the alien tripods are using human beings as fuel and there is A LOT of blood as exhaust. As a single adult, I pay little mind to the MPAA rating. But PG-13 is light for the amount of blood there is.Finally defeating a tripod, Ray and Rachel are back on track to Boston. Apparently every one has family in Boston because everyone is going towards the city. We witness the ultimate demise of the aliens and make it to Grandma's townhouse in Boston, despite the very urban setting of Grandma's house (possibly down the block from Cheers), the entire block remains unscathed. The aliens apparently know not to mess with Grandma.The entire extended family emerges out of the house on queue for Ray and Rachel's arrival and what do we discover? Robbie survived and beats them there! Hugs all around.With all the liberties that Spielberg took with the original work, he still decided to use Well's original 1898 ending. After 107 years of technological advancement the ending is less believable, a new twist would have been welcomed.Here is the real dilemma; the movie is not worth the price of admission but a 32- inch TV will not due the special-effects justice.",4,1,2,13 March 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," Rags to Rags story
","This movie was on my see list but not very high, when at the Cineplex it was at the right time. This is a rags to riches story; we get a lot of rags and almost no riches. The riches are in the two lines of text in the epilogue of the movie. Maybe it is my own financial woes of late that are finally turning around but if I commit to traveling this journey with Chris Gardner (Will Smith) through the woes I wanted the pay off and it was not there. We were brought to the edge of his success and left there. That being said Will Smith did an excellent job. I did like that Smith had is own real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, play Gardner's son Christopher. As Well as Smith actually solves the Rubik's cube in two minutes.",6,1,1,13 March 2007
