Deja Vu," What a pleasant surprise
","We love Academy Award winning actor Denzel Washington, so we try to see his movies because we can expect a well-told, well-acted story. However, the trailers for Deja Vu did not even come close to preparing us for this thriller. We missed seeing it in the theater. How lovely it would have been to see beautiful Paula Patton on the big screen. Nonetheless, it proved to be an enjoyable rental! The love story beautifully unfolds as Denzel's character becomes involved with a mysterious woman. The clues he uncovers never gives the story away. And the explanation of the secret technology was just scientific enough to keep us interested without going over our head. Good job.The finale answered the last scientific question, which made the journey worth the investment of time. And, for us, it raised the entire film to a score of 10. Nice work!",10,1,2,1 May 2007
