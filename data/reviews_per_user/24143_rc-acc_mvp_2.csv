Blade Runner 2049," Best movie I have ever seen?
","Blade Runner 2049 in a visually stimulating, thought-provoking masterpiece in movie making. Of the many questions it asks of its viewers, the one that kept repeating in my mind as I watched was, 'Is this the best movie I have ever seen?' It is 'The Dark Knight' good.As much as I would love to delve deep into the plot with you, it would be a crime to spoil any of '2049' for you. Let's just say that questions will get answered, questions will get asked, and things will get wrapped up at the end....tho more movies could follow. ;)Director Denis Villeneuve, along with Writers Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, and Executive Producer Ridley Scott, have constructed a world that presents Los Angeles as a dark, eternally raining, visually breath-taking fantasy land. In fact, the visuals are so beautiful you could watch all 164 minutes with the dialogue turned off. In fact, I hope the blu ray will feature a 'Music Only' track option.As for their story........The two leads, Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, have never been better. I have to confess that I have never been a fan of Gosling's as the first movie I ever saw him in was 'The Notebook', and have - unfairly or not - held this against him for years. ; ) However, after his performance in '2049' and 'The Nice Guys', he better be careful cos I'm starting to develop a strong man-crush on him. His muted performance as Blade Runner Officer K (think Philip K.) should gain him - at least - an Oscar nomination.I believe an Oscar win for Harrison Ford as Best Supporting Actor is all but locked up. His reprisal of the role of Rick Deckard: Blade Runner/Human/Replicant (?) is one of 'the last true larger-than-life Hollywood star's' finest performances. Ever. Whether Deckard is a human/replicant/something else doesn't matter here - the humanity and emotion Ford brings to his multi-layered performance is one for the ages.Concerning the rest of the cast, Ana de Armas is terrific as K's virtual, live-in girlfriend, Joi (I always wondered what Siri looked like - she's pretty cute). She, as a hologram, ALSO asks the question of what is like to be a sentient being, and credit to de Armas for a performance that leads us to take this question seriously....so does Joi's and K's love scene; yes, you read that right. She also provides the answer to this: Do we spend too much time in our (quite inferior by comparison) virtual worlds today and miss out/ignore what is happening all around us? Uh, yes.Jared Leto is at his creepy best as Niander Wallace, the new maker of 'more human than human' replicants. Along with his partner-in-crime Luv, (Sylvia Hoeks) they....well, I won't spoil anything for you, but the dude has a greater 'god complex' than Tyrell ever imagined, and, well....you know....Finally, the score by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer is a beautiful homage to Vangelis; and, Elvis and Frank also show up, proving once again that even in 2049, their music is timeless.So, where did Deckard and Rachael go at the end of Blade Runner? What does it mean to be human? Maybe 'sentinent' is a better word. What IF replicants can do something (hint, hint) ONLY humans are supposed to be able to do? These questions are asked right from the beginning....as K is a replicant - or so he's been told. He, um, wants to be *more* than this....which leads him on a quest to find Rick Deckard. As with Luke Skywalker these days, Deckard has vanished, but since he perhaps has the answers to all of K's questions, one in particular - K sets out looking for him....but at this point, K also has a lot of people after *him* so....when he meets up with Deckard - and Elvis and Frank and Marilyn ;) - it all hits the virtual fan.164 minutes never went by so fast. You won't get bored. Denis Villeneuve, along with Cinematographer Roger Deakins, should both get Oscar nods for their work on this film. I mean, talk about layering. On ONE hand, this is such a beautifully created world, one could - as I said - watch this with the dialogue turned OFF. OR....it a terrific Neo-Neo-Noir detective story. THIRD....it is all of the above with questions asked by all of the Philosophers throughout all the ages. It is amazing how just how much story and Easter Eggs can be packed into *only* 164 minutes. There are so many homages and nod/winks to (fans of) the first film: a pot boiling over on a stove, a massive Atari advertisement, (Philip) K driving a spinner made by Peugeot........but you get my point. So, go see this SEQUEL - NOT a REMAKE - to 'Blade Runner'. And, I cannot wait for the Blu Ray: just hope it comes out sooner rather than later.Thanks for reading.",10,4,13,17 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," It's the best of the new trilogy....
","....so disregard all the hate coming from the basement dwellers on IMDB (most of whom haven't actually SEEN the film, anyway) and go see it. You'll like it; it's the third best movie in the franchise. 9/10.PS: Have you noticed that ever since President Trump took office, even the movies are better? MAGA 2020!!",10,0,6,20 December 2019
