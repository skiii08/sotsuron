The Blair Witch Project," In 1999 One person went to the cinema to watch a film, a week later his comments were found
","There's nothing worse than hype, I however had done my best to avoid it as much as I possibly could, still the overbearing view that this was 'supposed' to be the scariest movie of all time did cross my mind when I went to see it, and then again at the end of it when I walked out of the cinema completely unaffected by what I saw.  if you read other peoples comments they'll say it was either the scariest film or the worst, I tend to agree more with the latter, although I can see the potential behind the idea, and the fact is, the film gets you talking regardless.  I believe had they had given themselves a bigger budget to work with it could have been phenominal, and I heard that the unsteady camera work put many people off.The film itself has some good points, the fact that quite a lot of what you see is essentially just improvision is one of them, I do feel it was a bit of a let down though, I certainly wouldn't say its a one to watch, but if you want to see something different, and can stand the nausiating affects of unsteady home-movie style camera work then give it a whirl, it'll either scare you s*****s or bore you to tears, either way you'll have something to talk to with your mates.",2,0,1,17 November 1999
