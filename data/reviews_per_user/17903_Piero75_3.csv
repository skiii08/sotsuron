Requiem for a Dream," Plenty of substances, just very little substance
","Now, let's start by making it clear that this is an extremely stylish movie. There is no denying that the camera work, visual effects and creation of atmosphere are extremely effective. The drug taking scenes are very powerful when they are viewed the first time, and the second time, maybe even the third, but by the fourth, fifth...tenth..twentieth time the same rapid sequences of drug-taking and their immediate effects wear very thin. Had the film been any longer I think I would have thrown a bag of flour at the screen.The plot is very, very predictable and the visuals are tacked on in categorizable chunks. After a while you will be waiting for the next step down on the ladder of visual hallucinations. These, like the other effects, are very stylishly done and are quite disturbing at times, but there is really nothing new here.For some reason this film reminded me a lot of 'Jacob's Ladder', though I think the latter is better and has a much higher re-watchability. In places the camera work was very similar to 'Killing Zoe', again, a slightly better film in my opinion. 'Requiem for a Dream' just doesn't have any substance beyond it's own simplistic message and clever effects; there is just too much repetition here.Is the acting any good? I don't think so. There was really nothing challenging to be acting about unless you count stereotypes as challenging acting. Each character gets high, gets into a stuporous rage and eventually gets hurt - there is no restraint and everything is just blended together so that even a hint of a good performance is lost in the mixture (a problem I find with many American films these days).However, my final comment will read, 'this movie took me somewhere I didn't want to go, and it did it effectively. It just did it about fifty times in less than two hours and then ended'.Note: I loved Pi, and was quite disappointed with this film.",6,1,2,10 February 2005
Lost in Translation," Speaks for itself
","Not too much to say about this film except that the title sums up the film and it is wonderful to watch. It won't knock you out of your seat with excitement but the scenes of Tokyo are very nicely worked and you get a real feel for the city as a tourist would.On a technical note, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson work very well together. You never once feel that their relationship is false; all the stiltedness and unease you may remember from liking someone when you first meet them is there. And as they get to know each other the film follows them along at an easy pace.I can understand that some people might be disappointed upon seeing this film, it reveals very little and really goes nowhere. However, it is to be enjoyed at a relaxed pace and shouldn't be judged by its 'thrills' (or lack of).",8,0,1,19 July 2004
A Quiet Place," Imagine Jurassic Park, then go and watch that instead.
","A 90 minute version of that bit in Jurassic Park where they're trying to hide from the Velociraptors in a Laboratory. Even the kids look remarkably similar. And if you're wondering how they'll deal with their various noise-problems as the film progresses, don't bother - the solutions are all drearily predictable and un-entertaining.Some questions... if they're in imminent danger day and night from killer monsters with superhuman hearing, why do they keep metal trinkets and buckets on shelves, waiting to be accidentally knocked off crashing noisily to the floor? How do they sleep without snoring or groaning?? How come the so-fast-you-can't-even-see-them-with-freeze-frame monsters are somehow hard-of-hearing, slower and easily distracted when someone important is in danger from one??? How do the family use their toaster????!!!!!",3,0,0,15 March 2019
