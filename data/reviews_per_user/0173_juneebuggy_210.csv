The King's Speech," Exceptional, loved the behind the scenes look into the royal drama
","This was good and historical movie buffs and royalists will love it. A little dry (as you'd expect) but uplifting and Oscar worthy from Firth who will bring a tear to your eye. The problem with seeing a movie that's been all hyped up and received a ton of awards (including a best actor Oscar) is that you expect to be blown away and usually end up disappointed, as was the case for me here. It's a well done movie on all counts though, costumes, locations, set design etc. And yes Collin Firth is exceptional as 'Bertie' the stuttering King George.I enjoyed how this started before he became King and therefore gave us a look into his bully of a father, the scandalous abdication of his brother and his impromptu and unwanted ascension to the throne just as England enters the 2nd world war. I actually found all the behind the scenes royal drama far more interesting than his speech lessons with Geoffrey Rush. I also adored Helena Bonham Carter in her role as the Queen mother. 8/30/14",7,1,2,24 September 2014
Moneyball," Not a fan of baseball or statistics but I liked this a lot
","Well colour me surprised, I went into this expecting to be bored silly despite Brad Pitt and the Oscar nominations. I'm just not much of a baseball movie fan though so I figured I'd give it half an hour (because it was on TV) and bail. But somehow this held my interest despite the fact that (yes) its about baseball, odds/statistics and v-e-r-y slow moving.I can't even explain why I liked this? Well the amazing performances helped. Led by Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill as Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane who turns baseball on its ear when he reinvents the Oakland A's, by employing unorthodox scouting methods and statistical data to place a different sort of value on the players he picks for the team.This did make me realize just how disposable the players are. Brutal. Oh, and apparently it's is based on a book, undoubtedly a very dry, heavy on statistics and number crunching, audience specific book. Kill me now! 09.13",7,1,1,26 November 2014
The Legend of Bagger Vance," A very watchable movie but...
","Yeah, I'll be honest this was a little dull even with everything going for it which included Robert Redford as director, a big budget and a great cast. It just failed to capture me on any level; with sport, magic, love or even inspiration, it was all just very long and very bland.The story is set in the 1920's following a golfer who returns from WW1 and attempts to recover his game and his life with help from a mystical caddy. It's definitely a very watchable movie, beautifully shot and with great performances.I really enjoyed Jack Lemmon (in his last movie role) and also the kid that played him as a young boy. Will Smith as 'Bagger' was good, everyone involved was. Charlize Theron; beautiful, nice accent. Matt Damon, well sure, good enough but I never really got that he was suffering from the war in any way, he was just subdued, wanted to be left alone and enjoyed a cocktail or two in the gambling den.And wow do they ever play a lot of golf. I mean I get that this is a 'golf movie' but did we really need to see every swing from their 3 day marathon game? 11/24/14",5,0,2,17 January 2015
Black Swan," Wow!
","So that's why Natalie Portman won the Oscar. She's absolutely incredible in this. Pretty great movie too, a little artsy for my taste but intense, scary in parts and I love it when a movie ends and you have to work things out in your mind, you have to think, figure it all out and other people have a completely different view about what was going on than you did. Anyways, Natalie totally deserved the Oscar for her performance here as a New York ballet dancer who gets the lead in Swan Lake. Perfect for the role of the innocent white swan 'Nina' becomes completely consumed with the dance, transforming and losing herself as she as she pushes her body to the limit, becoming more and more like the dangerous black swan. 02.24.14",9,1,3,13 November 2014
Men in Black 3," Decent sequel, Watch it for Josh Brolin
","Decent sequel to the franchise. Not great or even all that memorable but okay. I thought the story idea was clever which has Will Smith as agent J traveling back in time to 1969 and reuniting with his partner, agent K who is still a young man.Josh Brolin is just amazing as a young Tommy Lee Jones, nailing his looks and mannerisms perfectly and that to me was probably the best part about this movie. Some decent action sequences, a cool motorcycle chase, aliens and CGI.",5,1,1,25 September 2019

Mission: Impossible III," my favourite of the MI movies
","I would have to say this is my favourite of the Mission Impossible movies to date. Slick and stylish with amazing action scenes, great special effects & locations, a gripping story and a fantastic cast, including Philip Seymour Hoffman who kills it as the bad guy here. Very intense and just awesome.Tom Cruise also gives 110% to his role and you can tell. Lots of fast, intense running scenes for him as well as some very heartfelt tears -the scene where he thinks his wife is dead and also when he asks her to trust him, no questions asked.I thought the scene where the team busts into Vatican city, and all that entailed was excellent and wow that action sequence on the bridge, taking special effects/action to a whole new level.The tiny bombs being implanted in peoples heads was a new idea and one I found quite freaky. On that note I can't seem to get Keri Russell's blown eyeball out of my mind. Just an all round great movie experience. 6/7/15",9,1,1,25 June 2015
Captain Phillips," 'Look at me! I'm the captain now!'
","Quite good, guess I was expecting more though based on all the hype. Story follows Tom Hanks (as yet another) Captain, this time of a U.S cargo ship who tries to outrun Somali pirates but eventually gets boarded and then taken hostage in a lifeboat. It's inspired by a real life hijacking from 2009 and the movie does a fantastic job of building the tension as things progress. The story also doesn't rely on CGI or anyone saving the day to make things more exciting although we do get a huge section with Navy boats, SEALs and a helicopter but I suppose that part is true.Tom Hanks character is subdued until the end when he's in shock, that's when I enjoyed him the most. He does a good job, he's Tom Hanks. We also get things from the pirates POV which was great, I felt sympathy for all of them. Barkhad Abdi is fantastic but all the pirates were good, not just evil, faceless bad guys but multidimensional characters with backstories. Worth checking out.",7,1,1,30 November 2019
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Crazy good CGI from a movie only the fans will appreciate
","I watched this again when I stumbled across it on my TV and couldn't turn it off. This is just such a guilty pleasure.Pretty much only fans of the series will like this as here we finally get the wedding in all its glory, including (unnecessary) close ups of the dress, jewelry and even Stephanie Meyer as a guest. And then finally Bella and Edward get down to business, with the much anticipated feathers and even a broken headboard. -More than I was expecting from the love scenes actually.Of course then things go rapidly downhill for our couple and I have to say the special effect are pretty mind blowing. I mean it becomes a true horror movie as we watch Bella transform, losing a good 40 lbs (via CGI) as her fetus (sorry baby) destroys her from the inside out. And that birth scene, jeez, talk about gory.They also dealt with the (creepy) imprinting issue well too, using a visions of the future aspect for Jacob. Nov21/12",8,3,10,24 November 2014
Source Code," A thoughtful, sci-fi thriller
","Jake Gyllenhaal plays Capt. Colter Stevens who travels back in time (sort of) and inhabits the body of a male passenger on a Chicago bound passenger train in the (8 minutes) leading up to a deadly explosion, which kills everyone on board. It's his mission to find the terrorist responsible.I really enjoyed this, especially the ending which (despite the super happily-ever-after) is open to interpretation or possibly even a sequel. I also loved how this movie slowly unravelled itself, with more pieces unveiled to both Colter and the audience with each subsequent 8 minute trip he took. I wasn't all that surprised by Colter's condition but it was still shocking and very sad. A pretty great movie I'm still thinking about.05.13",8,1,3,10 November 2014
Skyfall," Everything you want from a James Bond flick
","Excellent movie showcasing pretty much everything you'd want from a James Bond flick; amazing stunts, exciting action scenes, hot cars, gorgeous women, (a sexy Bond) martinis, giant lizards and even some throwbacks to Bond films past. Adele's opening theme song also deserves a nod, its excellent.Javier Bardem is brilliant as the bad guy -a disgraced and psychotic former agent named Silva. I also really enjoyed Naomie Harris as Eve; that shaving scene and wow 'take the shot' the opening bridge action sequence -moving train and excavator! Yes over-the-top but also awesome.Daniel Craig plays this role to perfection. This time around he must defend his boss 'M' after M16 is attacked and disgraced by a mysterious villain named Silva. With only field agent Eve to help him 007 races to defeat Silva, restore M's reputation and protect her at all costs. Judi Dench was very good here too. I felt like we got to know the characters in this movie (at last) as some of their history is revealed.Just an all round great viewing experience; fun, sexy, riveting and even emotional, a superb instalment to the franchise and so much better than Quantum of Solace. I will definitely be watching this one again. 8/31/15",9,2,5,16 September 2015
United 93," Intense, real time docudrama
","Wow, intense docudrama style movie with very little scripted dialogue. What I mean is this didn't feel like actors reading lines, you just watch events unfold in real time through the eyes of people going about their normal day, which for some included catching the ill fated United flight 93.A very fly on the wall type feeling here as we also witness air traffic control trying to deal with the ensuing chaos, the military (OTIS) and the young terrorists themselves.A couple moments stood out for me; as flight 93's doors are sealed for the flight, clicking into place my breathe caught because we know the outcome of everyone on board, and of course as the passengers band together and storm the cockpit with the plane plummeting down.I have my own views on what actually happened there (which I won't get into) but to me they were verified when the movie felt the need to reiterate that no fighter jets were nearby and that the president never gave the OK. Doesn't matter in this case, I still enjoyed the story. 10.13",9,0,0,9 December 2014
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Visually stunning, super unique, fun movie
","I'm rating this high because it was super unique and the special effects/CGI were awesome. Just a fun, fast-paced visually stunning movie. So of course its also ridiculous but you know that from the title going in.We follow Abraham Lincoln from a young boy, witnessing his mother being killed by a vampire and then dedicating his life (among other things) to eradicating them. I liked how we got to see him in the different stages of his life; a beardless Abe in his twenties as he's taken under wing and taught how to kill vampires, becoming a hunter and in his fifties as president when the bloodsuckers side with the confederates, threatening to take over the country and win the war. As I said the special effects are awesome (the fight scene atop the herd of horses, the train via the burning bridge among others.) It almost takes on a Matrix-y quality in the way the fight scenes have been shot, all slow-mo flying through the air, just stunning. The acting is also good, the costumes and sets true to the period. A big surprise hit for me. 9/23/14",8,1,2,24 September 2014
Minority Report," 'I have to know. I have to find out what happened to my life.'
","I've tried to watch this a couple times now and even with a top cast, Spielberg directing and great special effects I still found it a slog to get into. Its just kind of dull and meandering. Towards the end it finally came together for me, I got into the conspiracy and unique plot, also at this point Tom Cruise starts running for his life and Cruise + running never fails. He's good and gives his all to the role.Story goes; Its 2054, Cruise is a cop in a hi-tech pre crime unit. He goes on the run after being labeled as a future killer by the psychic 'Cogs.' In order to prove his innocence he kidnaps one of them who predicted his imminent crime.Notes; This didn't ever feel like Spielberg movie, why has it been filmed entirely in fuzzy blue tones? Colin Ferrell... I didn't see that coming, cool gadgets, the surgery sequence is neat but very weird, the 'cogs' have gotten annoying fast, why are they living in a pool? How can they live submerged in water indefinitely? Eyeball gags also got old fast; rolling down the hallway and falling through the grate, just silly.Overall a good sci-fi crime thriller but I wouldn't watch it again.",6,3,4,27 March 2020
If I Stay," Decent adaption
","I really liked this book, the movie adaption is decent but honestly also pretty forgettable. Sort of along the lines of The Fault In Our Stars but not. This story follows Mia Hall after a car accident puts her in a coma. Through flashbacks we reflect on her life while she decides whether or not to wake up and face her new reality. Most of this story is told through flashbacks; to her sweet loving, meant to be hip parents, her little brother, her (endless) cello playing and her up and down relationship with the popular, older bad boy from the band who for some reason has fallen for... her. Mia gets accepted to Juilliard, her boyfriend goes on tour, Stacy Keach is her grandfather, Mia roams the hospital and her memories with endless musical interludes including cello recitals and watching her dreamy boyfriend play in bars. I found the music too much in this, with entire songs shown when little bits would have been fine. Enjoyed Mireille Enos as the cool mom even if the family ws portrayed a little TOO perfect.Definitely preferred the book on this one.",5,0,0,3 March 2018
Friday Night Lights," One of the best sports movies I've seen
","Really great football movie following a West Texas High School team from an dying town where 'winning isn't everything, its the only thing.' The movie is based on a super popular book and chronicles the entire 1988 season of the Permian High Panthers.Its been filmed almost documentary style, so that at times the camera work is shaky (always hard hitting) and you really get to know all the characters involved on and off the field (players, coaches, mothers, fathers, pastors, boosters, fans and families struggling with ongoing personal conflicts.) These boys all want to escape their small town and the pressure placed on them from family and the townsfolk is enormous, with the general theme being that this fight for the state championship will be the most important thing they ever do with their lives.There are some great performances here, Billy Bob Thornton as Coach Gary Gaines is kinda mind-blowing, he is just so good. I mean all he really does is spout off football-isms but wow, he also conveys so much more. And Tim McGraw was a huge surprise here as an abusive alcoholic, reliving his glory days father to one of the players (complete A-hole). Lucas Black also impressed as did the storyline following Boobie and his Uncle, just heartbreaking. Up there as one of the best sports movies I've seen. 11/5/14",9,0,0,2 January 2015
Gravity," Basically its a disaster movie that without all the amazing visuals is just okay.
","Yes this has absolutely stunning special effects, in fact I've never seen anything quite like it. How the hell did they film this anyways? Its also claustrophobia inducing and a hell of a thrill ride, yet despite all that Gravity just didn't do it for me.Now I can't claim to know anything about physics but it all just seemed far-fetched to me, so that basically what you've got here is a disaster movie that without all the amazing visuals is just okay.Gravity reminded me of 'Apollo 13', in that everything that could go wrong does, for astronaut Sandra Bullock -who is having the worst day ever. George Clooney is just being George Clooney (he's barely in the movie), a space cowboy playing the same character he is in all of his other movies. Charming, flirty, heroic in a humble way. He was this guy on ER like a hundred years ago.Anyways I'm sure if I'd seen this in the theatre I would have given it a higher rating as that's how its meant to be seen but that would still be based on the special effects not the story or the acting or the gratuitous floating underwear scene.Still I don't regret watching it, the effects are game changing and it must have been gruelling for the actors to film. The ending also left things a little vague. Where was Sandra? 5/10/14",6,1,2,10 October 2014
Lone Survivor," Brotherhood of warriors, the Hollywood version,
","Enjoyed this one a lot, intense, action filled story of bravery, heroism and survival. I also immediately disregarded the book it was based on and watched it purely as Hollywood entertainment. On that note its a good war movie. The action never lets up and I enjoyed all the actors involved (Mark Wahlberg, Ben Foster, Emile Hirshe, Taylor Kitsch, Eric Bana) they're believable as soldiers.The opening of this is powerful, showing our 'lone survivor' battered and bloody getting some serious medical attention aboard a helicopter, his heart stops... and then the images switch to real footage of potential SEALs during Hell week, ignoring pain and pushing through at all costs. I suppose this is meant to show how our four men can later fall down a mountain (twice) get shot multiple times, break several bones and still carry on. Although it could also be a nod to Marcus who dedicates a large part of his book to explaining the training SEALS go through. I highly recommend reading his book, its excellent.The story is based on Navy Seal, Marcus Luttrell's bestseller following himself and three others on a covert mission into the Afghan Mountains to locate a Taliban leader. The mission is 'cursed' from the onset, with poor communications and a run in with goat herders that sees the men ambushed, badly outnumbered and fighting for their lives before receiving help from several local villagers. Its a good movie if a bit too a bit too much ra-ra flag waving propaganda at times. I did like how we briefly got to know the back story of these guys before the sh!t hits the fan.From the cast Ben Foster stands out as he always seems to,Wahlberg does a good job as Marcus, I got Emile and Taylor confused most of the time as they looked very similar. Shout out to the make up team who did a great job here with the changing bruises, scratches, swelling shut eyes, missing fingers, bones sticking out of leg etc. It all looked very realistic. 4/13/16",8,0,0,31 May 2016
Erin Brockovich," Enjoyed this just as much in my re-watch as I did years ago, a brilliant movie
","I hadn't seen this in several years and I'd forgotten what a great movie it is. Of course its Julie Roberts who steals every scene and really makes this film shine. I'm not generally a fan of hers but she owns this role; outspoken, spirited, trashy doesn't have a filter, but you cheer her on because she's also hard working, loves her family is genuinely concerned about the clients and is relatable.I liked everything about this fact based drama. Albert Finney is awesome, sparring with Erin and how many of us fell for Aaron Eckhart here? Sigh. Almost unrecognizable as the nice guy biker boyfriend/babysitter.Roberts plays an outspoken, somewhat trashy single mother in her Oscar winning role, who after browbeating her lawyer into giving her a job almost singlehandedly brings down a California power company accused of contaminating a towns water supply -to the tune of 333 million dollar settlement.This is just a brilliant movie, funny, frustrating (scary regarding the big cooperation) filled with great characters and I just love seeing the little guy win for a change. 2/3/15",10,1,1,1 March 2015
Fury," Men often make up in wrath what they want in reason
","Really good, brutal, violent. A thundering war thriller set during the allies final push into Europe in April 1945. Brad Pitt is a battle weary army sergant leading his Sherman tank and its crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Along for the ride Jon Bernthal, Michael PeÃ±a, Shia LaBeouf, and the new guy Norman Ellison. Excellent extended cast, amazing battle scenes, ended pretty much as I expected, left me exhausted.",9,1,2,10 January 2020
Inglourious Basterds," This isn't going to be a popular review but I can't be the only one
","Well thanks for that Quentin Tarantino I finally made it through. I found this movie extremely frustrating because although it is well acted, suspenseful, clever, violent, funny and perfect in a lot of ways the editing (?) drove me nuts. Now I know Tarantino did it this way on purpose but it made most of the 'chapters' with their l-o-n-g drawn out scenes and endless dialogue just painful to watch. I wanted to get on with it, and honestly found myself bored with 90% of this extended, dragged out movie.Every scene just went on & on with so much unnecessary footage, that I suppose was meant to add to the suspense but honestly just made me want to hit the FF button.I will say that the ending is kinda awesome (I wish it were true) and that Christopher Waltz is worthy of his Oscar and then some. The opening 'chapter' at the French farmers house with all the pipe lighting and politeness and Shosanna! did kinda blow my mind, it was so good but jeez. 08.13",5,0,1,8 January 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Hope
","Yay, an original story finally this is the best of the Disney era Star Wars films and I loved how this tied into the 1st (4th) movie perfectly with Princess Leia's 'hope'. Story is solid and follows a ragtag band of freedom fighters including a former soldier turned prisoner, a rebel alliance insider and a blind Jedi who work together to steal the Death Stars blueprints -and, according to the battle briefing in Star Wars we all know how well that worked out for them. Anyways this was super good, what I'd been hoping for all along with these new movies. No real review here just random thoughts.Fun references to original trilogy throughout, the guy with the face from the bar on Tatooine that bumps into people and picks fights apparently as a hobby, Leia's father Jimmy Smits -had to wrap my brain around the timeline for his character appearance, loved the blind Jedi Samurai dude, the battle on the beach is very Pacific WW2 feeling, Darth Vader's castle and him in the healing bath, cool but they should have shown his missing limbs, the longer I'm watching and the more I get attached to the characters the worse I feel for their inevitable outcome, Diego Luna and Felicity Jones are now in a scene reminiscent of Tea Leoni & her dad in Deep Impact, Vader kicking ass at the end is awesome how I always felt he should be, powerful and super angry, blew my mind a bit actually but he says too much, Vader is better with less James Earl Jones, the ending is 10 stars, Hope line with CGI'd Carrie Fisher, sigh.",9,1,1,16 May 2020
World War Z," More a pandemic movie than a true zombie movie
","This was good, not quite what I was expecting though in terms of a horror movie and pretty much ignoring the (documentary-style) book its based on. Its a big budget action thriller and on that note the action/zombie apocalypse happens almost immediately (5 minutes into film) so that you don't get a chance to know the characters before the sh!t hits the fan.Who is this dad Brad Pitt? Why are he (and his wife for that matter) so calm and excepting of the mayhem taking place around them? They just take it in stride, gather some supplies, a weapon and carry on.Eventually this does (sort of) get explained, Pitt is a former UN worker who must come back for that dreaded 'one last job' in order to keep his family safe aboard an aircraft carrier while he races against time to save humanity from a pandemic that has triggered a global war between mankind and the undead.I'm not a fan of the fast moving zombie but it works here as this is more of a pandemic movie than a zombie movie. I really liked the section in Israel, exciting, unique and well done with the zombies all piling on top of each other to climb a huge wall, swarming like the ants shown in the random opening images. I also enjoyed the plane crash and the section at the WHO lab in Cardiff with Mr.snappy teeth zombie.This is definitely more a pandemic movie than a true zombie movie and there's very little gore shown, mostly just CGI special effects. I also wouldn't call this a horror movie, its not so scary. I think I might like this more in a rewatch when I'm not expecting Walking Dead-esque events. 3/13/16",8,1,1,13 April 2016
The Hunger Games," The ultimate in reality television and a decent book to film adaption
","I would describe the story as Survivor meets Stephen Kings 'The Long Walk' or Orwell's '1984'. It is the ultimate in reality television, romance, scripted realism and survival. Involving 2 children from each of this future society's districts who must compete in a cruel televised tournament in which the 24 lottery 'winners' fight to the death for the entertainment of the masses. Yup I always knew reality TV was evil and this is where its headed.The second time was the charm with this movie for me because I enjoyed it way more when I caught it on TV the other night then I did the first time around. Not exactly sure why or what changed for me except that it's now been a few years since I read (and loved) the book so I wasn't as busy comparing the two. The movie still dragged a bit in the middle for me and Katniss spent way too much time hanging out in trees but ultimately I was entertained throughout.Great casting in Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth, well everyone really; I liked Woody Harrelson & Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci & Donald Sutherland.They also did a good job of recreating the world that Suzanne Collins had created in her book (Capital city, all the crazy makeup, girl on fire costume) and explaining what the hell was going on in this post apocalyptic society, which couldn't have been easy. There was also less violence here, with very little actual bloodshed on screen (for ratings purposes?) and someone got to keep their leg, so that was nice albeit a little dull. 12/29/14",8,1,6,5 March 2015
The Impossible," Intense viewing experience with great performances from all
","Wow, this was an intense viewing experience, which brought me to tears more than once. I actually watched it twice with the rental, picking up little bits I'd missed the first time through. In my re-watch it was interesting to see the family 'before' after witnessing their 'after'. All clean and uninjured, careless and happy.The actual tsunami scenes are fantastic, very well shot or CGI'd(?), but its the aftermath with all the bloody (realistic) injuries, the hospital scenes and the chaos going on around the separated family as they try to find each other that really drew me in.More than once I questioned the decisions made by the adults (I'm pretty sure I'm not leaving my kids anywhere) but that's another reason I liked this so much, -what would you do? Outstanding performances from Naomi Watts, you can feel her pain and fear and also Ewan McGregor and the boy playing their oldest son Lucas.A couple of events towards the end had me thinking really!? That's convenient, but still a great film. I wish now I'd seen this in the theatre as it was obviously made for the full viewing experience, playing with your senses using sound and visuals. 07.13",10,0,0,23 February 2015
Argo," Perfectly solid movie with vivid detail to the time period and filled with a list actors
","Good as expected but I wouldn't say great. I guess I was just expecting more somehow based on all the accolades this received however I can't fault anything here either. Argo is a perfectly solid movie, filled with A-list actors and flawlessly delivered. What really blew me away was the attention paid in vivid detail to recreating 1979/80, it was like stepping into a time machine and a fun flashback for me.Based on a declassified true story we follow CIA exfiltration expert Tony Mendez who uses the production of a fake science fiction movie called 'Argo' as a cover for a rescue operation in the middle east during the Iranian hostage crisis. Mendez creates a phony Canadian film project, scouting locations with Iran as a possible shoot and then smuggles the Americans out under fake passports as its production crew.Directed by Ben Affleck, my guess is that he was distracted as his portrayal of Mendez was pretty flat, his mood never changed, he was just tense, miserable seeming and kinda grumpy throughout. Was this his character? It is filled with A-list actors though such as Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Victor Garber, and Bryan Cranston who contribute in a big way to making this a great movie. 9/20/15",7,0,2,10 October 2015
Star Trek Into Darkness," Visually stunning, action packed reboot
","Into Darkness was a fantastic movie experience it's visually spectacular and action packed although in all honesty I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the first but its still pretty awesome. Its the kind of movie that Trekkies will love but can also be enjoyed by those just looking for a great action adventure movie.Without getting spoilery I can't talk about my favourite parts but as a Star Trek fan I'll just say that my mind was blown several times. Sure I also had a few niggles (which I won't get into) but all the characters have grown into their roles here and at times I almost forgot that this was a reboot; the comradery between Kirk and Spock feels so familiar, Bones' metaphors, Spock's odds/bedside manner are all brilliantly done. I'm just loving this alternate universe that J.J Abrams has created and can't wait so see where this '5 year mission' takes us next.Shout out to Benedict Cumberbatch who steals every scene that he's in, what a great bad guy even if he did feel a bit super-heroish at times, running around kicking ass in his long black hooded coat. Zachery Quinto was also pretty amazing. Special effects have finally caught up to how Star Trek was meant to be seen. 05.13",9,3,7,17 June 2015
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Funny, family drama with 'photoshopping'
","This was really good for a rom-com, just different and edgy enough with some really funny moments via Steve Carell alongside bittersweet true life drama to make it work for me. There's also a great cast of secondary characters and damn Ryan Gosling... 'photo-shopped.' He plays professional bachelor Jacob Palmer who helps a newly separated Cal (Carell) navigate the singles scene after his wife (Julianne Moore) asks for a divorce and his perfect life crumbles.I laughed out loud several times here (the wallet while clothes shopping) and liked how this ended up being a totally different movie than what it started out as. The last 20 minutes are just hilarious, including a big twist (I didn't see coming) and the fight. 'Keep it in the family okay?' 5/19/14",8,0,1,21 October 2014
The Notebook," I'll be seeing you....
","I hadn't seen this in a few years and caught it again on TV the other night. What a great movie. I honestly had forgotten just how... compelling and heart wrenching this is and also loved being transported back to the 1940's. Just an epic love story on all counts.I guess its reached cult status by now as one of the best romance movies of all time. I know it is for me. Even being familiar with the story I still found myself all caught up in Noah and Allie's star crossed lovers romance. And Jeez I had forgotten all about James Garner, I almost started crying as soon as I heard his voice, just fantastic. 'I am no one special just a common man with common thoughts...' I think this might be one of the few adaptions where I actually like the movie better than the book too. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are perfect and give the characters such life, creating everlasting magic together. I can't imagine anyone else in those roles, and the chemistry, its no wonder that carried off screen for a time. Yup I fell a little in love with Ryan Gosling again myself.As a whole this is old fashioned storytelling. Its episodic, well acted on all counts, gripping, shameless and beautifully shot, I mean come on, the scene with he swans, and god damn that kiss in the rain.

Public Enemies," Not without its faults but I enjoyed it- nice to see Johnny Depp playing someone normal
","I enjoyed this, it was nice to see Johnny Depp playing someone normal,(not a cartoon character). A longish movie well set in the 1930's following notorious American gangsters John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd during their booming crime wave.Possibly because of this has story has been written but John Dillinger's life seemed pointless to me. He was either on the run, escaping from jail or being shot at and never seemed to be able to just sit back and enjoy his stolen bank loot.Many scenes that I enjoyed but where he walks right into the FBI headquarters and asks the score on the baseball game was pretty hilarious. The ending was also very good. I enjoyed the romance here too, that scene when Billie gets arrested and Dillinger has to leave her and drive away, that look ...a little heartbreaking. 01/13",7,0,0,24 October 2014
Ted," Funny, as promised
","If you're a fan of Seth MacFarlane or a child of the 80's then you'll enjoy this. It's filled with pop culture references, crass comedy and fantastic cameos, Very funny (in a 'Family Guy' humour sort of way) and I definitely got my share of laughs.Ted himself is well animated which adds to the magic, and despite finding his Peter Griffin voice initially distracting (loved that they addressed this) I totally fell for him and his bromance with Mark Wahlberg.Wahlberg does a good job, he's perfect for the role as a Bostonian who as a child successfully wishes his teddy bear to life. 'John' gets more than he bargained for when the stuffed animal follows him into adulthood, complicating his relationship with (Mila Kunis). Now he has to choose between his girl or his friendship with the crude and extremely inappropriate Ted.The plot here is nothing special, its familiar, I would even say cliché but it doesn't really matter because events are just so hilarious. On another note, I could definitely tell that Seth McFarlane is (my age) by the bits I found funny or ironic or nostalgic, like the Darth Vader case for all the action figures, Airplane re-enactment, Flash Gordon or Indiana Jones notes played on the stairs. 2/7/16",7,1,2,3 March 2016
127 Hours," Great movie even if it did leave me traumatized
","It's been a few days since I watched this and I'm still feeling kinda traumatized, I just can't get that scene with the tendon out of my head. All in this is a pretty fantastic movie, beautifully filmed, exciting, multilayered and wow James Franco who, for the most part carries this all by himself.Its based on the real life events adventurer Aron Ralston faced while trapped in a Utah canyon for five days with his hand stuck under a boulder and how he eventually resorted to desperate measures in order to escape. Ralston filmed a daily video diary while he was stuck and in a lot of the scenes its Franco talking to his little camera, sending a goodbye message to his parents as he gets weaker and weaker from lack of water and his thoughts and (flashback) memories get more bizarre.There were moments watching this when I actually felt sick and I'm not talking about the obvious parts (those were brutal and I watched 'that' scene peeking through my fingers) but the entire movie made me feel anxious, starting with the foreshadowing of him packing, showing all the food and water and him trying unsuccessfully to find his Swiss army knife, just out of reach on the shelf. The scene with the flood is awesome as is the one where he slides down the chute with the two girls -there is no way I could have done that, so freaky. His determination to survive and finally ASK for help is remarkable. 6/28/14",9,0,0,29 September 2014
Creed," When was the last time you cheered at the movies?
","Creed is that movie, taking the franchise full circle with this brilliant instalment. As a lifelong fan of the Rocky franchise I had of course been anticipating this movie, but what I hadn't counted on was that it would be such a good movie. I mean I knew I'd enjoy it but even the non Rocky fans I saw this with thought it was great. Creed captures what was so brilliant about that first film; the downtrodden characters, the love story, the city of Philadelphia and oh yeah a fight for a championship that is really all about character not about a belt.Sylvester Stallone is heartbreaking and exceptional in this, easily giving one of his career best performances and his chemistry with Michael B. Jordan is pretty special too. These two worked so well together. The story was engrossing and well thought out, funny at times, sad, exhilarating and brought me to tears more than once. It also pays respect to the Rocky series as a whole while taking it into a new generation with the wonderful Michael B. Jordan.During the final fight when that original theme music started up the audience started cheering and applauding. I can't remember the last movie I went to when the audience was so involved. 11/30/15",10,6,12,30 December 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A Great movie for those non comic book fans
","I enjoyed this X-Men prequel from start to finish. A great movie for those non comic book fans like myself. Exciting action scenes and all around fun, plus plenty of shirtless Hugh Jackman to roar over.I liked the story here too, exploring the beginnings of Wolverine's powers, his tumultuous relationship with his brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) and its decline. I loved the flashbacks of them during all the different world wars they fought in and their ultimate reliance on each other. There's a bit of a love story, and then the reasons behind Wolverine's metal claws. We also see the introduction of a bunch of other mutants, and the final battle with the super (combined) mutant dude is excellent, leaving Wolverine at the end a bit like The Littlest Hobo (Canadians will get this reference) 12.13",8,2,3,16 October 2014
The Others," Worth a rewatch, still spooky even knowing the outcome
","Hadn't seen this in years and enjoyed it almost as much in my rewatch. I will say though that knowing the outcome changed the fear factor a bit, almost like watching a different movie in that respect. Its set on the Channel Islands in 1945, a ghost story that deals with Nicole Kidman as a troubled young mother, awaiting the return of her long missing husband from the war. Her two children have a rare photosensitivity disease which means they cannot be touched by direct sunlight, her daughter claims to see ghosts. The mother hires servants to help in her spooky mansion, she thinks they are playing tricks but their arrival changes everything. I still struggled with the scene with the husband, even 'knowing' it felt awkward and just strange and Nicole does wear on you after a while with her dramatics. Great movie though, scary, atmospheric, stylish with a slowly unraveling plot. I enjoyed the mystery",8,0,0,4 April 2018
Just Go with It," Turned the brain off, got a few chuckles, nothing original here
","This had occasional humorous moments from another forgettable Adam Sandler comedy. Here he teams up with Jennifer Aniston -which was bound to happen sooner or later since she makes the same romantic comedy over and over again as well.Here Sandler is a plastic surgeon who enlists the help of his loyal assistant (Aniston) to pretend to be his (soon to be) ex-wife to help him woo a much younger schoolteacher and everyone ends up in Hawaii (because Sandler has admitted that's where he likes to film movies).Anyways the plots not really important, its a pretty silly movie with some terribly unfunny (stupid) dialogue. Some of the messed up plastic surgeries did give me a chuckle, but this just tried too hard and didn't succeed. Zero chemistry between Sandler and Aniston, who both portray the same characters we've seen from them in all their other movies along with a clichéd plot and just too long in general.I'm not sure what Nicole Kidman was doing here but she must have had fun with her role even if her hula/coconut scene went on about 10 minutes too long. 03.13",4,5,6,10 March 2015
About Time," He always seemed to have time on his hands.
","Domhnall Gleeson (who looks like a young Conan O'Brian) is a lonely time traveller who meets the love of his life in Rachel McAdams and attempts to win her heart time & time again after a glitch in the process renders them complete strangers. This was good, maybe not as good as I was expecting as it drags a bit in the middle but still charming. Bill Nighy is the dad here, he's very Bill Nighy which is great; funny dry, sarcastic, explains to his son on his 21st birthday, this is what happens to the men in our family--no big deal.Really the time travel aspect is secondary here, 'Tim' just flashes back, fixes a few things, gets the girl Groundhog Day style, its more about fatherhood and life, about time and not wasting a moment of it. I loved that message at the end when the father tells him to live each day twice. Once as normal and then enjoying and noticing the little things the second time around, not worrying. A great message.",7,0,0,10 January 2020
Terminator Salvation," Enjoyed it for the most part
","This was ok...a lot of bad reviews out there but I enjoyed it for the most part after I removed myself from the Terminator franchise and just took it for what it was. Its loud, fast, loaded with CGI, a bit of Road Warrior, a bit War of the Worlds and a bit Transformers with ginormous OTT terminator machines (they were terrible.) Less Christian Bale than I expected after all that media hype and press surrounding him. He was actually kind of a secondary character. I enjoyed Marcus's storyline and Sam Worthington's portrayal of him. He doesn't know what he is but come on, this is meant to be a big twist but not really, its more the anti-twist. What did he think happened to him on death row after he signed his body over to Skynet and woke up in the future? Blah. Enjoyed seeing Sarah Conner on tapes. I liked the tie ins to the original story very much. I also enjoyed Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese, portraying one of my favourite heroes of all time from the original Terminator ...sigh...Anton.",6,2,3,12 February 2018
Insomnia," Atmospheric thriller. Robin Williams does a great bad guy
","A good thriller this one, atmospheric, taught and keeps you guessing. I sure do like Robin Williams in these roles as the bad guy, (also check out One Hour Photo) he is so good, creepy in an understated way. Al Pacino gives a great performance here too, conflicted, stressed and slowly unraveling from lack of sleep. I think his character stays awake for 6 days and it was fascinating to watch him try to cover his expanding pack of lies while going crazy. (Director) Nolan sure likes to torture his leads in unique ways.Insomnia takes place in a remote Alaskan town where, because its summer the sun doesn't set. Two Los Angeles detectives are dispatched there to investigate the homicide of a young girl (why, I'm not sure). Hilary Swank plays an impressionable young officer who meets their seaplane -I liked her here, trying to impress Al Pacino as the folklorish cop hero.While apprehending the suspect Al accidentally (?) shoots his partner and then covers it up, giving the lurking Robin Williams killer character blackmail ammunition against him. These two have some great scenes together, cat and mousing their way through the second half.The scenery is beautiful here, unique especially if you don't know better as I found myself distracted at times by Squamish (B.C) posing as Alaska with shots of the Chief, the mill, Chieftain pub, Britannia beach etc. A good thriller. 2/9/15",7,2,3,11 February 2015
Aquaman," Boba Fett is Aquaman's dad. A non superhero fan review
","Worth watching just for Jason Mamo's opening shot; shirtless, from behind, he stands, flips his hair back and gives a cheeky grin. Yup there's your price of admission. Ha, truthfully I only watched this for Jason Mamoa, I'm not a fan of all the comic book movies, so have no idea what the Justice League is or where this fits into the deluge of superhero movies.So this is a origin story and on that note Boba Fett is Aquaman's dad. Cool. He (Temuera Morrison) gets it on with Nicole Kidman and somehow they produce Mamoa?! Boy grows up, gets some teachings and then he returns to his mothers home to challenge his half brother king Orm to preserve the balance between the surface world and the ancient civilization of Atlantis.There is a ton of CGI in this, most of the movie is CGI, there is a quest to find a triton in the desert, there is a girl Aquaman hangs with, Dolph Lungren and Willem Dafoe both float about underwater with weird hair and shiny outfits, there is a big battle, giant seahorses, strange soldier/roboty type guys with big guns. Jason Mamoa looks good throughout. Justice prevails.",5,1,1,1 November 2019
Deadpool 2," 'I hope you sharpened the cream cheese spreader'
","Funny, really funny I've seen this a couple times now will probably watch it again. Storyline goes... Irrelevant warrior Deadpool (after several failed suicide attempts) recruits some mutant fighters to form X-Force. The mission is to protect an (annoying) boy with supernatural abilities from a time-traveling mercenary named, Cable, AKA Josh Brolin.Humour is fast irrelevant, silly and filled with pop culture references. Over the top violence. Ryan Reynolds in the perfect role for him, comparable to when Johnny Depp found Jack Sparrow the role he was born to play. The New Zealand kid is pretty annoying throughout, about my only complaint.",8,2,3,28 November 2019
Match Point," This torrid love affair left me very thirsty
","Pretty good for a Woody Allen movie, which is to say that I struggle through his stuff (even with the best of intentions) and this one managed to keep me hooked. Scarlett Johansson is (uber sexy) here and she and Jonathon Rhys Meyers are excellent together -smoking hot chemistry. I liked the entire extended cast and the London location.It's a bit of a slow burn to start, with tons of character development. The last hour makes up for it though, its very tense, surprising and brutal. I wasn't sure how 'that' was going to play out -well done.A couple of things did annoy me; the ongoing score of opera music (that's just me) and the fact that the characters were always drinking something. I actually got quite distracted by this as they poured, stirred, raised and sipped their way through the dialogue. Water from a pitcher, a bottle, the tap. Tea, coffee, beer, champagne cocktails, G&T. It became an overused prop. One of the few Woody Allen movies I've made it through in its entirety though. This one left me very thirsty. 04.16.14",7,1,1,24 October 2014
Midnight in Paris," A love story to Paris I struggled through
","This one was a struggle for me to get through. Actually I'm kinda surprised by all the rave reviews here. I think what put me off the most was how annoying all the central characters are. Griping, obnoxious, arguing and just being horrible tourists. Owen Wilson was alright, bumbling along as usual, this time with a bit of a Woody Allen thing going on because that's who he's meant to be right?! This was beautifully filmed though and the love story to Paris is really the best part of the movie. I also enjoyed the storyline, I was into the fantasy of travelling back in time to 1920; intriguing and magical. It was also fun to see some familiar faces playing the likes of Salvador Dali and Earnest Hemingway and it seemed like the actors were having a great time with their roles. 04.14.14",3,1,2,1 June 2015
The Last Song," Heart-tugging and addictive, Nicholas Sparks gives his take on teen angst
","'The Last Song' is another Nicholas Sparks adaption and one of the weaker ones. It's also been aimed at the teen angst audience with Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth as the romantic leads. On that note I guess if I was 20-ish years younger I would have enjoyed it more than I did.The story is predictable and heart-wrenching, because well, Nicholas Sparks wrote it and he loves to torture us, following a father and daughter who after a long estrangement slowly reconnect over a summer in a small Southern beach town through their mutual love of music.Cyrus plays the bitter wild-child Ronnie who falls for the often shirtless but very employable Will. They both have a lot of secrets and struggle to carry this movie as newbie actors. Miley giggles and squeals her way through the romance while Liam just stands about looking good.I did enjoy Greg Kinnear as the doomed father and the boy playing his son was like a breathe of fresh air. As with all of Sparks' movies the coastal scenery is beautiful and the storyline about forgiveness, acceptance and family shamelessly manipulative but oh so addictive. 2/14/16",7,1,2,8 March 2016
The Prestige," Dark, twisty, stylish and suspenseful
","This was better than I was expecting; dark, twisty, stylish and suspenseful. It's a fantastic period piece too and you really find yourself taken back to the Victorian era.The Prestige follows two stage magicians as they try to one-up and ultimately destroy each over the course of their careers. Always searching for that one next great magic trick and eventually revenge after Alfred (Christian Bale) is accidentally responsible for killing someone close to his brother (Hugh Jackman) Of course there are great performances from all involved and the audience is left trying to catch up and figure out the many twists involved. And while I got the how's of one of them ending up in jail I sure didn't figure out the big reveal at the end. Michael Caine plays their mentor, and there's a neat cameo from David Bowie. Worth watching. 12.13",8,0,0,16 October 2014
Cloverfield," A total thrill ride...after those first 15 minutes
","I almost gave up on this because the first 15 minutes are super annoying. Watching a bunch of young New Yorkers at a going away party through the shaky, jarring point of view of a hand-held video camera. Thankfully I stuck with it though because after those first 15 minutes, when the sh*t hits the fan, look out! Cloverfield then becomes a total thrill ride as we follow 5 of those partygoers (documentary style) through the city as a giant monster descends on New York. You really feel like you're in it with them due to the unique imagery, reminding me at times of some of the post 911 shots seen on TV. Anyways I ended up getting quite wrapped up in this.The story is pretty good, nothing too original but because of how its been filmed it feels unique as the army descends, N.Y is evacuated and one of the characters attempts the carnage to rescue his girlfriend.I loved how the monster isn't fully seen for quite a while (in a 'Jaws' sort of way) this made it much scarier. 'did you see that?' 'what the hell was that?' I think a lot of the dialogue was probably unscripted here too. I also liked the ending which is left...vague, with lots of questions, so that you're asking yourself 'And then what happened?' Would love to see a sequel to this. 5/31/14",8,1,2,6 October 2014
Hotel Rwanda," Cheadle is amazing in this heartbreaking movie
","Don Cheadle's Oscar nominated performance drives this heartbreaking and emotional drama set during the Hutu-Tutsi civil war in Rwanda. Cheadle plays hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina, who tries to save the lives of more than a thousand Tutsi refugees by hiding them in his hotel.A few scenes that will be hard for me to (ever) forget, the 'bumps' on the road as they drive through the fog, the little orphan girl exclaiming 'Please don't let them kill me, I promise I won't be Tutsi anymore' Yeah, brutal. So anyways. A good movie, Cheadle's performance is amazing, I had a hard time accepting Nick Nolte as a 'Canadian' UN Colonel, Joaquin Phoenix is essentially a cameo, not a big budget Hollywood film and all the better for it. Reminiscent of Shindler's List in the beginning as Paul tries to pay/barter for Tutsi's lives. 8/26/14",9,0,0,24 September 2014
Molly's Game," This is not a nice game
","This was surprisingly good, One of those unbelievable true stories. It follows Molly Bloom who finds success organizing poker games for wealthy and or celebrity clients. For a decade she runs the world's most exclusive high-stakes poker game until she is raided by the FBI for hosting members of the Russian mob. Molly turns to a charismatic-honest lawyer to keep her out of jail and our story begins.I couldn't care less about poker but the way the story is told in voiceover from Jessica Chastain is gripping. She does a fantastic job with this role. Idris Elba is the lawyer, they have great chemistry, while Elba does a good job of looking good in every scene, Lots of interesting side stories to follow, Molly's professional skiing and Olympic career, drug use, the money, multiple cameos -mostly as poker player dudes. Kevin Costner is her dad. Some violence as Chastain gets beaten up bad by the Russian mob. I liked this one a lot.",7,1,1,1 April 2020
Dear John," Exactly what I was expecting from a Nicholas Sparks adaption... except maybe for the ending
","Another Nicholas Sparks adaption, so of course it's a total chick-flick which ultimately I enjoyed just not as much as the book. Its actually a pretty depressing love story and in the film version it annoyed me that neither character aged a day (or changed a hairstyle) over the 7 year course of the movie. The book ending is also much more realistic than the one presented here.Channing Tatum, plays 'John' a soldier who falls in love with an idealist college student (Amanda Seyfried) while on leave and continues to communicate with her via a series of letters throughout his military service.Channing Tatum. As much as I adore him his portrayal of John is kinda bland. He doesn't (or can't) convey much emotion so he just kind of dumb-de-dums along while looking super good. I did enjoy his scenes with Richard Jenkins who plays his autistic father (and is awesome as usual). This relationship seemed to bring out the best in Tatum, acting wise. The romance angle was just okay for me, a nice Notebook-ie reminiscent kissing scene in the rain. The scenery is beautiful too, wherever this was filmed. 08.13(2)",7,0,0,28 December 2014
The Expendables," It is what it is and for me it was awesome
","This was just all kinds of awesome however it also is what it is, and doesn't make any excuses for it. If you go into The Expendables with the right mindset, wanting an adrenaline charged, flat out action movie with over the top explosions, car chases, knuckle grinding fights, bullets & bloodshed galore, and just all out amazing action sequences then you will absolutely love it. And that's exactly what I did, sitting in the theatre with my family and literally cheering along with the audience, it was so much fun.There were also some surprisingly soft and touching scenes here, including one with Mickey Rourke. I enjoyed the story for exactly what it was, loved all the guys and their banter, the fantastic cameos, and the references to action movies of the past. Stallone was in top form, Eric Roberts was the perfect bad guy, Statham (gah) always fine, Jet Li -funny (who knew) Terry Crew's big gun just killed me and left my ears ringing, awesome! 12. 22.13",9,1,2,13 November 2014

","Lacks the novelty aspect of the first film but still a fun ride with another great hook to start things off, this time a highway traffic accident that a girl has a premonition about and ends up saving multiple strangers who must then pay the reaper.Some great deaths, the scenes at the dentist were brilliant, freaky. I enjoyed the cop working with premonition girl and the story arc that has them finding the one surviving person from the first movie. Not at all the ending l expected. Good franchise.",6,0,0,16 November 2019
The Way Back," What an incredible story
","I mean these men escaped a Russian gulag and WALKED 4,000 miles from Siberia to India, come on...So this movie is based on the 1959 memoir 'The Long Walk' (of which there is some debate over its validity). Regardless I really enjoyed it, the story is incredible and I'd been looking foreword to seeing what they would do in the movie version. Throw in a top notch cast as our Siberian gulag escapees (Colin Farrell, Ed Harris, Jim Sturgess) and this should have been fantastic. All I can say there is maybe my expectations were too high because honestly I came away a little disappointed, actually preferring the book.The movie itself was very long and kind of jumped around. Granted they had a lot of material to cover as our men escape under cover of a snowstorm and undertake a treacherous journey across thousands of miles of hostile terrain. They face freezing nights, lack of food and water, injuries, mosquitoes, an endless desert, the Himalayas, and moral questions of when to leave someone behind.The cinematography is beautiful, the scenery breathtaking and everyone does a great job. Ed Harris is excellent as the American Mr. Smith (love him) and Colin Ferrell (love him a bit more) was awesome as a tattooed gang-style prisoner, with an amazing Russian accent. As a point of interest his character is not in the book. The scenes in the blizzard and the Gobi desert stand out to me and are brutal but well done. 08.11",7,8,9,26 January 2015
Knocked Up," I was drunk!
","A drunken one night stand becomes much more when a rising tv personality realizes she's pregnant with the fun loving, stoner dude she hooked up with. A lifetime slacker is then thrust into the responsibilities of fatherhood.This is a fun watch, decent story, clever and witty dialogue, loads of familiar faces and cameos in the cast and a surprising amount of heart for this type of comedy. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann stole the show for me, and I actually enjoyed their marriage and even the hilarious stoner friends more than Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogan's baby drama.

Closer," The ultimate anti-romance with outstanding dialogue
","I just love this movie I can't really explain why but I've seen it multiple times now and its just so well written, clever, witty, honest and raw. It definitely watches like the play its been based on, with tricky & unique sections of dialogue but there is also something more to this movie.Its sort of an anti-romance, taking place over several years, it jumps ahead, months, a year ,without explanation following four people who start out as strangers but end up tightly connected after using and abusing each other. Everyone is to blame and selfish here. All the performances are brilliant except maybe Julia Roberts who struggles to keep up with Natalie Portman, -amazing and Clive Owen. Jude Law also gives a great turn but its nothing we haven't seen from him before.The story is about seduction and betrayal following the interwoven relationships and betrayal of an obituary writer and failed author (Law), a photographer (Roberts), a stripper (Portman) and a doctor curious about the dark side of love (Owen). No one is who they seem and they all and hurt each other. The dialogue is unique and kinda brilliant. Great soundtrack too. 1/6/16Anna: Why are you dressed?

Suicide Squad," Nothing unique or all that impressive.
","My favourite scene in this movie would be when The Joker pushes his girlfriend into a vat of ... melting crayon wax? Then feels remorse, precedes to save her and then laughs and laughs as their clothes melt? Swirling colours float around them, just beautiful.Anyways as a whole this movie this was just okay, nothing unique or all that impressive. The beginning was interesting enough as the squad is introduced by a government agency recruiting some of the most dangerous incarcerated super-villains to form a defensive task force. We get some back stories, Batman, the Flash?! whatever, then it gets boring and disjointed with dark CGI action scenes as they try to save the world from the apocalypse.A big cast; I enjoyed the leader army dude 'Flack', Viola Davis is ok, nothing special for her, Will Smith just plays himself, Margot Robbie is good; fun, interesting, sexy. I saw Adam Beach for about a second and Scott Eastwood, a bunch of other familiar actors. Jared Leto is not used enough, is barely in this why? What a waste.",6,0,0,29 January 2020
Life of Pi," Made me believe in good storytelling... and good CGI
","Yup, this was super good, visually stunning from beginning to end, just an absolute feast for your eyes and even managed to make to make me cry during THAT scene on the beach with the tiger.A ton of CGI in this but wow do those animals ever look real. The story itself is a bit exhausting, following a zookeepers son who is shipwrecked and spends over 200 days aboard a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Almost the entire movie takes place aboard the lifeboat and his epic journey of adventure is gruelling but also magical.Life Of Pi was an absolute favourite book of mine and I'd wondered how Ang Lee was going to transform Yann Martel's magnificent tale to the big screen, well, he succeeded beyond my expectations, even the (open to interpretation) ending has been handled well.It begins with an adult Pi dictating his life story to an author searching for material for his new book. The author has been told that Pi's story will make you believe in god. I don't know about that but it did make me believe in CGI and good storytelling. 11/9/14",8,0,2,28 November 2014
Over the Top," The more I think about this movie the more I love it
","Wow not sure what I was expecting from a movie centering around arm wresting, but I guess I got it. This gem is from 1987 and about all it has going for it is the B-grade 80's campiness that now make it fun to watch. I mean who doesn't want to cut all the sleeves off your t-shirts, slap on a pair of suspenders, oil up your arms and drive your big rig off into the sunset while listening to Frank Stallone and Kenny Logins on the 8-track and yelling 'over the top' at the screen. Awesome stuff.This is one of those so bad its good movies that just gets better with age because it gets cheesier. Its along the lines of Rocky V -which was pretty terrible too- and is more of a father/son drama than the sweaty, sinew straining, pulse pounding action you'd probably expect from a movie about arm wresting.Sylvester Stallone is the awesomely named 'Lincoln Hawk' a truck driver trying to reconcile and gain custody of his estranged son after his ex-wife becomes deathly ill. Grandpa (Robert Loggia), is not having it though and his son is angry and disrespectful which makes for a (not so) fun road trip after Hawk busts him out of military school and takes him out truckin' in an attempt to bond.Ultimately it comes down to Sly oiling up and arm wrestling for the custody of his son at the Las Vegas world arm wrestling championships.This is heavy on the family drama and emotion and dare I say, takes too long to get to the arm wresting part which (come on) is why we're watching this. That part of this film isn't so bad, Sly knows how to do these kinds of action scenes and (I guess) there are some genuine techniques used -It looked good. I'm not embarrassed to admit by the end I was totally invested in him winning the championship and the custom semi-truck so he could start his own trucking company and the more I think about this movie the more I love it. 3/7/16",7,0,0,6 April 2016
Doctor Strange," Forget everything you think you know.
","This wasn't the superhero movie I was expecting, more training and mysticism than actual superhero origin or saving the day. Tons of trippy special effects, along the lines of Inception with shades of The Matrix thrown in. This does look good, it's visually dazzling, following a neurosurgeon named Stephen Strange as he seeks an otherworldly cure for a severe injury to his hands. In time his quest leads him to study the ancient art of sorcery from a mystic in Tibet known as the Ancient One.I'm a big fan of Benedict Cumberbatch and as expected he does a great job here, problem is I just hated his character, he's a dick; selfish, egotistical and I sure don't feel sorry for him or his mangled hands. I also didn't care for the American accent, even if it was perfect. Several vague characters in this, the bad guy (Mads Mikkelsen) is not fleshed out at all (what's his deal?) he's just a villain with cool eye makeup. Benedicts love interest Rachel McAdams is also wasted in a small nothing role, as well as being very excepting of Dr. Strange's turn of events when she finally sees him again as a separated spirit ghost person. I might have had a few questions like where have you been and WTH! The cloak was fun.",5,0,0,4 July 2020
Interstellar," I got the message they were trying to convey about gravity and time and mankind and love
","The first time I watched this I could not wait for it to be over, Thought it was the dumbest thing I'd ever seen. Full of plot holes, recycled sci-fi ideas and just plain ridiculousness. The cast is pretty great but I had heard this was meant to be one of those game changer movies, an 'epic sci-fi.? Not so much.Well I caught it on TV yesterday and while I still found weird, lazy story flaws and things that didn't make much sense, I didn't hate it. I got the message they were trying to convey about gravity and time and mankind and love. I finally (somewhat) understood all the positive reviews out there although if you check here there are just as many bad onesInterstellar follows former astronaut, now farmer Mathew McConaughey and his family at some future point on earth when the atmosphere has become inhospitable to human life. McConaughey stumbles upon a sort of NASA headquarters in the back of one of the cornfields and soon embarks on a dangerous mission with Ann Hathaway through a wormhole in order to find a hospitable planet, oh and some time passes.Some of my issues; NASA is in exile right next door to the farm, how convenient, they're living in a dustbowl but only when it suits the filming schedule otherwise its cornfields, sunshine and chasing drones. McConaughey -who is a galaxy and a wormhole away- shows up in his daughters childhood bedroom 40 years later. WTH. Mind blown. Even the earlier ghosting doesn't really explain this bit of mind screwery.",5,1,4,25 September 2019
Pacific Rim," We created monsters
","This was big, loud and occasionally entertaining while dazzling with huge, crazy battle scenes. A visual spectacle in that regard but style more than substance. The story is predictable once it establishes itself and Charlie Hunnam has several shirtless scenes (for no reason I can think of other than to make (me) happy.) Nobody else takes their shirt off in the movie. I also wondered what the point was of having a stick fight training scene other than well, yum. It serves no purpose for operating the giant robots.Hunnam's voice-over establishes the world this movie takes place in and does a great job in conveying the scope of a film. The story follows a burned out pilot and an inexperienced rookie who are forced to work together piloting massive human controlled robots to save the world from giant monsters that have risen from the sea.I can see that there would be a definite audience for this type of movie as it looks like 'Transformers', 'Ironman', 'Battleship' etc, where the story is sort of inconsequential as its all about the huge special effects and CGI. Ultimately this wasn't for me but I knew that going in 'Transformers vs Godzilla' is not my thing, I just figured with Idris Elba and Charlie Hunnam attached they could help me eye candy my way through it which they did 1/19/16",5,1,1,27 February 2016
Romeo + Juliet," Took a while to used to the original dialogue in this Tarentino-ish retelling
","I'm glad I finally watched this but I'll be honest I struggled to stay with this slick, fast paced update of the Shakespeare tragedy. I wasn't expecting the original dialogue and it took a bit to get used to.Leo steals and captivates every scene that he's in though; so young, so cute and so talented, just amazing and it was through him that I eventually got into the movie. It's a very modern MTV-ish sort of retelling set in the violent, hip netherworld of Verona beach where the gun-toting Montague and the Capulet families battle for power and territory. At times this felt like a Quentin Tarentino movie in its visual style, cool music and random bizarreness. Great performances all-round but especially from Harold Perrineau, Romeo's gender bending friend and John Leguizamo as his arch rival. The big battle between these three is when the movie really took off 'a plague on both your houses' and the last half an hour is captivating as our star-crossed lovers meet their tragic destiny all because of stupid UPS. 9/20/14",7,0,0,24 September 2014
Ant-Man," Fun, entertaining origin story
","This was good, entertaining, would have been great to see in the theatre with the spc effects, kids will like this one. Its a superhero origin story following Paul Rudd as a con artist who gets a shot at redemption when his mentor (Michael Douglas) asks him to don a super-powered suit that shrinks him down to miniscule size, gives him superhuman strength and the ability to control an army of ants. We watch him learn to use the suit, assorted comical training scenes and fight off villains seeking to steal the invention.I liked Michael Douglas as the professor and the girl from Lost Evangeline Lilly. I thought Paul Rudd would have been funnier. Some holes in the story, although probably only applying to people like me who don't follow the universe ... not even holes really just questions... when he first breaks into Michael Douglas' house how can he scale the wall so easily? He's a hacker not a burglar right? What is the deal with Anthony Mackie swooping in, what's his story? Anyways, I liked the scenes where Rudd is shrunk down running in the grass, in the ant hills, liked his relationship with the ants in general 'Antony' . The bad guy was ok, kinda your stereotypical antagonist I recognized him from that FX vampire show The Strain (Corey Stoll)",6,0,0,5 April 2018
21 Jump Street," I must be missing something?
","There are a lot of really good reviews for this movie which has me thinking that I must be missing something because 21 Jump Street didn't do a thing for me. Sure I got a couple of laughs but honestly I found most of it silly; following two bumbling, youthful cops who go undercover at a local high school and essentially get to right their wrongs and be teenagers again while they investigate a drug ring.My favorite scene had to be Johnny Depp's short 'lived' cameo and I did laugh at the idea of two grown men living at home again, having to do chores before they go on their big drug bust. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have great comedic chemistry though and it shows, I bet they had a ton of fun on set. 02.21.14",3,1,3,21 October 2014
Bridget Jones's Diary," I like you very much just as you are
","I remember really loving Helen Fielding's book and this is an excellent adaption of a London singleton desperate to lose weight, cut down on her vices and find Mr. Right.Its slightly dated now but still super good, one of those comfortable rom-coms. Genuine laughs and a relatable heroine in Jones. Very British, perfectly cast with Renée Zellweger and Colin Firth, Hugh Grant for the love triangle.",8,0,0,14 May 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," Enjoyed the war story aspect, big budget and (sigh) the ending
","This was a decent movie, better than I was expecting since I'm not really a fan of the comic book superhero adaptions. I was intrigued by the WW2 storyline though and for the most part this is a war story which I liked. I also appreciated that they kept Capt. America's rah-rah patriotism down to a dull roar.Inception stories are always interesting and this sees Chris Evans become the first Avenger (whatever that means) Its 1942 and scrawny wannabe soldier Steve Rogers has been deemed unfit for military service again. He volunteers for a top secret research project that transforms (bulks him up) into a superhero and sees him using his newfound abilities to fight the German forces and a villain known as Red Skull.This is a big movie with a big movie budget so there's lots to enjoy in the form of cool gadgets, cars chases, fight scenes and big explosions. Chris Evans was decent as Capt. A, perfect for the role I guess. 'Mr Smith' aka Hugo Weaving did a great job as Red Skull and there are a ton of other recognizable faces involved including a last minute cameo from Sam Jackson. As a whole the story was kinda immature (which I expected) but I am still thinking about the ending, just loved it. 'You gunna be okay?' 'Yeah, yeah, I just... I had a date.' 9/17/14",7,2,3,24 September 2014
American Hustle," Who's the swindler and who's the mark?
","American Hustle is a better than average con movie- although I'm not sure worth all the hype- that's mostly down to the amazing performances from the leads who keep this so watchable, as does the late 70's music and clothing. Its stylish and genuinely funny in parts but also tends to be a bit long winded and drawn out.Honestly its also never quite clear who's the swindler and who's the mark and it doesn't really matter. At some point I just gave up trying to figure out who was heisting who and just went with it.The story follows Christian Bale & Amy Adams, two con artists recruited (after getting busted) by Bradley Cooper and the FBI to infiltrate the world where New Jerseys politics and the mob intersect. Bale's unpredictable wife Jennifer Lawrence could be the one to bring the entire operation crashing down.All that you've heard about the actors here is true...Lawrence is a definite scene stealer, very funny, Amy Adams is seductive and just amazing, Christian Bale is very fat and Bradley Cooper has very curly hair while also surprising with his cool disco moves.All-in I would sat say worth a watch but its long winded in its delivery and overrated.",7,1,4,24 January 2017
The Bourne Ultimatum," I could watch 100 of these movies
","Another excellent instalment but if I'm honest, probably my least favourite of the 3 Bourne movies, which is to say that its still excellent. My biggest problem here though was that they started this instalment by backtracking to the last 15 minutes of Bourne Identity'. Now this would have been fine except that Damon had packed on about 40lbs and aged significantly, so he looked quite different. This decision was jarring and made zero sense to me? Still this movie is full of awesomeness, with exotic locales, this time around (Morocco, Berlin, Paris and Madrid), cool but slightly over-the-top car chases and more awesome fight scenes. The Waterloo sequence is super well done and the action remains intense. I could watch 100 of these movies. 11.13",8,0,0,25 December 2014
Notting Hill," 'It's as if I've taken love heroin and now I can't ever have it again.'
","Bumbling, charming, funny, cheeky-very Hugh Grant. One of those feel good movies you catch yourself watching every time you find it on TV. Good chemistry between Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant help carry this romance between an American movie star and a shy British bookstore owner. The sub actors are equally important here though especially 'Spike' the flatmate, hilarious, William's sister and his inner circle of friends.Robert's character is shy, stilted but what I also noticed this time is that she hurts William again and again, is just terrible to him and he remains charming...just nice, understanding. She does not deserve him.My favourite scene remains the market montage with the 'aint no sunshine when she's gone' song and the changing seasons. The final shot is really sweet and beautiful, a couple at peace.",8,0,0,8 March 2018
Nightcrawler," Intense and unique thriller/charcter study
","This was a good one, dark unique storyline, which sees Jake Gyllenhaal as a shady crime journalist. Armed with a camcorder and police scanner he records violent events late at night in Los Angeles and sells the footage to a local television news station. Going to ever increasing lengths to capture car crashes, fires, murder and mayhem 'Lois' eventually films the aftermath of a violent home invasion, the resulting police investigation threatens to turn deadly.Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing in this; gaunt, brilliant, obsessed, slightly Rainman-ish and crazy. Even the way his character walks is unique. This was also a different story than I'd ever seen before which is so refreshing in this day of endless remakes, CGI fests and superhero movies. I was also impressed with Rene Russo as 'Nina' the news director who mentors Lois, welcoming his grisly crime photo footage as a chance to raise her station's ratings. Their relationships really shows Lois' rise to power. Bill Paxton has a small role as a fellow nightcrawler.Will watch this one again.",8,1,1,19 April 2018
Oblivion," I liked figuring this out initially until it reminded of every other sci-fi movie I've seen
","This was a very ambitious movie, feeling grand in scale but never really following through. The first half is better than the second, with a slowly revealing plot following Cruise as Jack Harper, one of the last drone repairmen still stationed on Earth. I happen to like movies where you have to figure out what the hell is going on, so this was kinda cool, sorting out what was happening in this future apocalyptic world. Some interesting visual effects in that respect.I did get the plot twists pretty early on though and the second half of the movie kinda fell apart for me. I spent most of it being reminded of other sci-fi movies (Total Recall), (Blade Runner), (Independence Day) and in particular the (Star Wars) saga. With 'Faux-Tom' and his partner living in cloud city, chasing sand people (Morgan Freeman), land cruisers, canyon chases and even Beech's 'death' scene reminded me of Darth Vader. The director obviously grew up with these movies.The final bit of cheese was when Jack spouted the now iconic (at least in my house) 'F U Sally' That got some laughs. 08.13",5,1,2,3 February 2015
The Bourne Identity," A game changer in the spy movie genre
","Yup, this was super good. Not sure how I missed seeing it before now? Great story, involving an amnesiac assassin who is rescued at sea by an Italian fishing vessel (with a couple bullet holes in his back) and then spends the rest of the movie on the run from his superiors (who have deemed him expendable) while also trying to piece his life together.Who is he? why does he have a Swiss bank account # implanted in his hip? How does he know how to do all the cool spy sh!t he does? Like fight (awesome fight scenes), use weapons, kill, evasive driving techniques. Some of my favourite scenes actually involved Jason being amazed by what he can do.I also loved that this took place in Paris & Zurich and was really filmed there. His love interest turned out to be more than just fluff too. I will definitely be watching this again, just fantastic. 11.13",9,2,2,22 December 2014
The Italian Job," Great cast, decent caper remake
","I've never seen the original 1968 caper film starring Michael Caine so I can't compare at all but this was a pretty good time. Mark Whalberg takes the lead here as a master thief out to retake the gold stolen from his gang after they pilfered it from a palazzo in Venice.The entire cast is of course fantastic and works well together, playing off each other and I enjoyed the non-romance between Wahlberg and (a very beautiful) Charlize Theron.The opening heist that takes place in Venice, including speed boat chases through the canals, safes falling through multiple floors of buildings and underwater shenanigans is thrilling and super well done as is the ensuing double cross (poor Donald Sutherland) and escape.I also liked the (I guess iconic) Mini Cooper chase scene towards the end, on train tracks, down stairs etc. Very cool.Ultimately this was an okay movie for me, not fantastic as it dragged a bit in the middle but one of those classic (remakes) that you just have to see. 12/26/14",6,0,1,16 April 2015
28 Weeks Later," Haunting and genuinely scary
","One of the better horror movies I've seen in quite a while. I really liked this, I think I might have even enjoyed it more than the first movie. Haunting and genuinely scary with an excellent story that gets marks for originality, has a superb soundtrack and a wow opening sequence -intense & scary- that really sets the pace for the remainder of the movie.This sequel picks up 28 weeks after the 'rage virus' has decimated the city of London, leaving it a ghost town. The virus has been eradicated, the infected have starved and an American led NATO force has moved in to restore order and supervise the repopulation of the quarantined city. For the most part we follow the Harris family, led by Robert Carlyle who is newly reunited with his children when a carrier of the virus enters the safe zone, the military loses control and all hell breaks loose again.It has a gritty look to it with loads of weird camera angles; overhead, close up, shaky and grainy and of course all the shots of the deserted London streets, eerie. Its gory and graphic, about what I'd expect from a zombie movie unlike WWZ which I watched the other night this is a genuine horror flick not an action-thriller/disease movie.The cast surprised me here too with turn ins from Jeremy Renner, Rose Byrne and a small role from Idris Elba. I do like me some Robert Carlyle and he does a fantastic job. I even enjoyed his kids and kids story lines often annoy me. 3/14/16",8,0,4,11 April 2016
Cast Away," Still super good
","I hadn't seen this in years and had forgotten most of the details. Its a timeless movie just as good today as when it came out in 2000. I'd forgotten that this is ultimately a love story, had forgotten the despair, the giving up, the suicide attempt, mostly just remembered Wilson and Fire!Tom Hanks is brilliant in his one man show of survival as airfreight executive Chuck Noland, a man who lives by the clock until his plane crashes and he washes ashore on a deserted island in the Pacific. For more than 4 years he struggles to stay alive sustained only by the companionship of a volley ball he names Wilson.I still I had to question how easily Tom excepts that he is alone on a desert island, I lived in the Caribbean, some islands are very desolate in parts, he might have at least walked around the bay, there could have been a Hyatt Regency or a road or a cruise ship dock but no he just hunkers down on the beach. Liked the relationship with Helen Hunt, how hard it was for both of them. That scene with Wilson and the raft still made me cry. Best actor nomination to Tom Hanks.",9,0,1,13 November 2019
Armageddon," Enjoyed my rewatch
","Hadn't seen this in years and thoroughly enjoyed myself in a long overdue rewatch. Special effects still stand up today, fantastic cast, humorous and excellent in terms of an action popcorn flick.Sure it heads into far fetched, over-the-top territory by the end as one thing after another goes wrong while shuttling about through an asteroid field, but I was invested. Its a fun ride including a sweet romance, multiple side stories from the extended cast and that iconic theme song from Aerosmith.If I remember correctly there was a string of asteroid disaster films that all came out around the same time Deep Impact was another I enjoyed.",9,6,8,25 September 2019

Trouble with the Curve," Unchallenging and predictable but also charming in an old fashioned movie sort of way
","I liked this one quite a bit even though it borders on predictable and Clint Eastwood portrays exactly the same hard headed, grumpy old man character he did in 'Gran Torino' and 'Million Dollar Baby'. Amy Adams is likable and engaging as his daughter and there is also a more than decent back up cast in Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, Robert Patrick, Matthew Lillard and George Wyner.This is not so much a baseball movie as a drama following Gus Lobel, a veteran talent scout for the Atlanta Braves whose eyesight (and ability to pee) is failing him. The front office begins to question if he has become to old to continue and an upcoming scouting job could be his last.This brings in his estranged daughter who reteams with Gus, putting her own career in jeopardy while hoping to finally get some answers from dad who (in another cliché Clint storyline) can't let go of the past.We also get a lukewarm romance between Adams and a former pick of Gus's turned rival scout named Johnny (Timberlake).As a whole this was unchallenging and predictable but also heartwarming and charming in an old fashioned movie sort of way. Its worth a watch. 10/23/16",7,1,1,27 October 2016
Wanted," Fun, entertaining, non stop action and Jolie does her thing
","I really enjoyed this, a non-stop action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. I mean its a total popcorn flick, way over-the-top at times but done in such a fun, entertaining way that you just go with it and think, that was kinda awesome. The opening scenes are very cool and set the tone well.James McAvoy plays a frustrated (American) office worker who is recruited by a sexy & mysterious (Jolie) to join a secret society of assassins and avenge the murder of his estranged father. This has a real Matrix vibe to it with healing baths, an oracle loom, bullets able to go around corners because the character 'thinks' they can, stuff like that. There's also a great twist involved and some seriously awesome stunts including Jolie scooping McAvoy up with her car, OTT train crash sequence and the two of them 'playing' atop commuter trains. Super fun.I just love Angelina Jolie in these action roles. She is just so cool, sure she only weighs about 95 lbs here and I doubt would have the strength to pull off (any) of the fight scenes without eating a sandwich first but I still enjoy watching her do her thing. I enjoyed McAvoy too, I always do even though it was weird to hear him with an American accent, no reason why they couldn't have kept his character Scottish. 10/19/14",8,1,1,23 October 2014
Warrior," One of the best movies I've seen in a long time
","I'm not even an MMA fan but I was totally engrossed in this and even moved to tears more than once. Heartbreaking and compelling, I guess you could say the story is also somewhat predictable (we've seen similar done in other sports themed movies before) its even far fetched, especially when it comes to the schoolteachers storyline, but the thing is, it just doesn't matter because it's such a great movie.And the acting, wow, its downright amazing. Nick Nolte's character is heartbreaking, but on that note (except for one slip up) we don't get to see him when he was a practising alcoholic either and from the state of his broken, shutdown boys you know he must have been a really, really bad man. I liked how this was left vague.Yeah his sons; Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy, so many layers to these guys especially Hardy who is captivating. He plays the youngest son who returns home and enlists the help of his remorseful (recovering) alcoholic father -and former coach- to train him for an MMA tournament awarding the biggest purse in the history of the sport. Meanwhile his older brother is on the verge of losing his house and also returns to the ring which sets the estranged brothers on a collision course for the title.The fight scenes are gripping and intense and had me peeking through my fingers 'arm bar for the tap out.' In the end, I mean you do want the brothers to come together and face off in the ring but jeez... that final round rips your heart out. A big hit and instant classic for me. 10/10/14",10,4,8,22 October 2014
Salt," Enjoyed the hell out of this
","Interesting story premise here along the lines of 'The Boys From Brazil.' I enjoyed this a lot despite the fact that it's way far fetched in places. It's one of those movies where you need to stop thinking and just enjoy the ride. Especially because there is something mesmerizing about Angelina Jolie as the action heroine, she just kicks ass so well.Jolie plays Evelyn Salt here, a CIA agent who goes on the run after a Russian defector accuses her of being a Russian sleeper spy. Tons of cool stunts and disguises and just an all round fun action movie. That 'choking' scene on the stairs towards the end with Liev Schreiber is just freaking awesome Dec/12",8,4,6,22 October 2014
We're the Millers," Better than I was expecting if predictable, some genuine laughs though
","This was actually pretty funny, better than I was expecting and definitely had its moments. I went in anticipating 'dumb' though so in that respect I wasn't disappointed and ultimately enjoyed my ride along with the Millers.The storyline and set up (while preposterous) at least managed to feel somewhat original, following Jason Sudeikis as a low level pot dealer who is forced to retrieve a 'tiny' drug shipment from Mexico in order to pay off his supplier after he gets robbed. He then finds and agrees to pay a stripper (Jennifer Aniston as eye candy but she does it well) and two misfit teens to portray his family as cover for his RV drug trafficking trip.Unfortunately its in the execution that this movie fails because the way events play out are completely cliché. You can tell what's going to happen miles away and there aren't any surprise in regards to the 'family' suddenly coming to care about each other. There are a lot of fun gags along the way though including a hilarious turn from Nick Offerman as a DEA.'We're the Millers' did make me laugh. It's pure entertainment and exactly what I was looking for at the particular moment I watched it so it worked for me. 2/10/16",7,0,1,7 March 2016
Disturbia," Predictable thriller but still a great ride.
","I enjoyed this more than I expected too. As a thriller it's very predictable, yet it still works, borrowing and updating Rear Window in a clever way. Shia LaBeouf plays a teen sentenced to house arrest who becomes convinced (through boredom) that his neighbor (played by a super creepy David Morse) is a serial killer. He does a great job, the kid can act and I liked his interaction with the entire cast. There are some laughs and a bit of romance with the girl next door and I felt like this showed teens in a realistic way. The opening scene with the car accident is shocking and brutal. It does fall apart a bit in the last 15 minutes but still a great ride. 7/23/14",8,1,1,29 September 2014
The Patriot," Sweeping saga, gorgeous cinematography its 'Braveheart' in 'America'
","I hadn't seen this for several years and I remembered why I avoided it when it was on TV (other than the length) Jason Isaacs is just such a bad, bad man, he's like Hitler bad in his portrayal of Col. William Tavington. Cold, calculated, brutal as he rides in and destroys lives, spouting off orders to kill the prisoners, hang your son, burn the barn, burn the house, and shoot the 'silly boy.' Just an epic bad guy on a level that's hard to watch.I found the movie itself pretty much without faults, sure its a bit too long in it's sweeping saga and is essentially 'Braveheart' in 'America' but Mel gives a great performance as peaceful farmer Benjamin Martin, who is driven to take up arms takes up arms and lead the Colonial Militia during the American revolution after a sadistic British officer murders his son.The entire cast is great (sigh Heath Ledger) and the cinematography is gorgeous, I mean like every single frame in this is beautiful. The attention to period detail is also flawless, the costumes, set design and battles. -which BTW drove me crazy, what a ridicules way to fight a war; walking in formation to the beat of a drum and just standing there while the other side shoots at you 'ready, aim, fire' and then you shoot back at them while the generals look on. The battles do get bloody here too. 7/14/14",9,0,2,24 September 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," Underwhelmed
","I think I must have gone into this with unrealistically high expectations after all the foo-fer-all made of it during award season because I came away underwhelmed. Sure the acting is fantastic and if this was meant to be a romantic comedy (?) its a good one, although I don't know how you could classify it as such. It is original in its storytelling though; sad, dark, fresh.Bradley Cooper gives a great performance as a man just released from a mental institution after 8 months, trying to rebuild his life and win his wife back, or at least get the restraining order removed. Jennifer Lawrence is good too but again I think I was expecting more from her due to the academy award she received.The ending was kind of meh, that's it? and I'll admit to being bored in sections as well as catching a couple of errors (duct tape appearing and disappearing on shoes). Philadelphia and their team The Eagles play a major role. There's a great supporting cast with Robert DeNiro and a refreshing role from Chris Tucker. 05.13",6,8,13,10 March 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Everything you'd expect
","This was good, high quality as in budget and performances. You also know exactly what your getting going into #5, more of the same. A bit long winded at times, some of the scenes went on and on like the opera take down. I remember this from the last one too.Amazing stunts, and not just the famous Tom Cruise on the outside of the plane taking off but him shimmying up a pole while handcuffed and flipping over the top of it. Amazing motorcycle sequence too. The drowning one freaked me out. Simon Pegg was less annoying this time around, less buddy cop banter. Enjoyed the kick ass girl.This movie is a good time, everything you would be expecting from an MI movie. Why was Alec Baldwin in this?",7,0,1,4 October 2019
Jarhead," 'Welcome To The Suck.'
","Amazing performances in this modern war movie especially from Jake Gyllenhaal who embodies (real life) marine Anthony Swofford, following him through boot camp to his assignment as an elite sniper during Operation Desert Storm. For the most part what this movie portrays is the ultimate boredom, frustration and psychological challenges these soldiers faced, waiting for their moment to 'see the pink mist.' There are some funny scenes here, some we've seen many times before (boot camp) but the strong cast (Jamie Foxx and Wow that 'take the shot' scene in the bunker with Peter Sarsgaard) really give us some amazing performances.This is also an absolutely gorgeous movie, I mean the cinematography is breathtaking, sometimes seen through a faulty gas mask or a game of desert football, with flaming oil fields in the night sky, black rain and an oil drenched, drowning horse. Haunting. as was the ending when we see the guys several years later. 9/29/14",8,1,2,6 October 2014
Bad Teacher," Bad teacher had its moments
","So this 'hilarious yet filthy comedy' isn't perfect but it had it's moments and did give me some chuckles with its raunchy humour, probably because I think this is how I would behave if I were a teacher. Cameron Diaz as 'Elizabeth' is described as a 'Booze-swilling, pot-smoking, hard-swearing seventh-grade teacher' and she's kinda awesome. Her body is also just slamming here and she totally gave me a girl crush with that car wash scene. Timberlake on the other hand is not so good as the handsome and rich substitute teacher that she fights her prudish colleague for the affections of. It may just have been that his character was such a wimp but to me he wasn't worth fighting over. A decent dark comedy though. 06.13",5,1,4,8 December 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," Entertaining but did we really need another remake already?
","I'm not sure why studios feel the need to keep rebooting these comic book superhero movies every couple of years Batman, Superman etc. The last Spiderman wasn't even that long ago -4 years- did we really need another remake already? And on that note I preferred the version with Toby Maguire (Spiderman) especially this first inception story.Anyways. This was still an entertaining movie, fun with good special effects. I enjoyed the cast; Rhys Ifans as the lizard man, Dennis Leary, Peter's parents Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Andrew Garfield was fine as Peter Parker, full of teen angst and nice to look at, but I just kept comparing him to Toby Maguire. The romance was kinda meh, it probably plays out better in real life (wink). So once again we follow high-school outcast Peter Parker as he embraces his destiny as Spiderman, investigating his late father's secrets, falling for the beautiful Gwen Stacy and in this version battling Dr. Curt Connors aka the Lizard. 9/21/14",6,0,1,24 September 2014
Now You See Me," A bit all over the place but ultimately entertaining
","Lots of bad reviews out there for this but I didn't hate it. It is a bit all over the place though so that even with the fantastic cast, original story and all the flash it just failed to impress me much in the execution. It sorta feels 'Oceans'ish except with a with a group of magicians known as 'The Four Horsemen' who pull off brazen heists during their performances, the proceeds of which they share with the audiences. This raises the attention of FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) who spends the rest of the movie trying to catch them.Its a caper film and very watchable, in fact there were moments were I thought it was going to be a really good movie but it never quite lives up to itself. Some parts of it are clever, others stupid. A lot of the story happens off screen then is just briefly explained by the characters or assumed by the viewer. There's a big car chase in the middle that comes out of nowhere and a crazy lukewarm romance going on between Ruffalo and a French Interpol agent. Towards the end it becomes almost fantasy-like with shades of 'National Treasure' thrown in and the actual ending just goes on and on; its over, wait another sub ending, another explanation, the credits, another thrown in bit scene.I did enjoy the extended cast though, as well as the initial set up and coming together of The Horsemen (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco) The banter between them is entertaining and there's also Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman who are such pros they can do no wrong. 1/10/16",7,0,1,8 February 2016
American History X," Powerful -worth a rewatch
","I hadn't seen this for a few years, it's still a compelling, provocative, violent and important movie. Edward Norton earned a best actor nod for his spellbinding portrayal of a violent neo-Nazi gang leader who ends up in prison for murder.He is fantastic here, you literally can't take your eyes off him. The entire movie is well made, well acted and gripping from beginning to end as we watch (through black and white flashbacks) 'Derek' begin to question his beliefs after going to prison and then transform upon his release, turning his back on his Nazi gang and finding a new purpose, to save his brother from talking the same destructive path.Edward Furlong (what happened to him?) plays the younger influential brother 'Danny' and it is through his school paper 'American History X' and narration that this story comes to life. He does a good job and I liked how the story was told. All the sub roles are well done too including Elliott Gould, Ethan Suplee and a creepy Stacy Keach.There are images from this movie that never leave you; the 'curb' scene is just... and the look in his eyes as Derek is arrested after. The shower scene in prison and the school washroom at the end. A powerful message to this movie. 3/9/15",9,1,3,8 May 2015
No Strings Attached," Predictable, forgettable with a couple of amusing moments
","Another predictable, rehashed romantic comedy. I'm pretty sure I saw the exact same movie in 'Friends With Benefits'. Anyways. In this version long-time friends Adam (Ashton Kutcher) and Emma (Natalie Portman) attempt to sleep together without bringing commitment (no strings) into the equation but true love enters the picture and complicates their plan (duh). On the plus side Portman and Kutcher's chemistry together did seem genuine and I enjoyed Portman's quirky character. There are a few amusing moments (the period mix CD) and I enjoyed Kevin Cline as Kutchers sleazy Dad, but a throwaway, forgettable movie all the way round. 11.13",5,1,2,25 November 2014
Inside Out," I loved the idea of those marble memories
","Pretty great Pixar movie, good for kids of course, especially the middle part with Joy trying to get the core memories back to headquarters, but pretty great for adults too. The story follows Riley, a young girl uprooted from her peaceful life in the Midwest and forced to move to San Francisco when her father starts a new job. We enter Riley's mind as she struggles to adjust to her new city, school and home life. Chaos ensues at 'headquarters' where new emotions have set up shop. Joy tries to keep things positive but anger, sadness and fear have made an appearance and core memories are being destroyed.I loved the idea of those little marble memories and have thinking about that for days now, it just makes so much sense. As an adult I found this movie thought provoking and sad (imaginary friend Bing-Bong is a bit heartbreaking), as you realize the losing of innocence we all face.Its Pixar so of course kids will love this but this one in particular is pretty great for adults too",7,1,4,19 May 2018
The Duchess," The original 'it girl'
","I thoroughly enjoyed this period drama. Keira Knightley's performance is brilliant, the costumes (her extreme hair) and sets are gorgeous, the true (ish) story involving and Ralph Fiennes is perfect as Georgina's callus, indifferent husband.This really is Keira Knightley's movie though and she does a fantastic job capturing the charm, intrigue, frustration and (often) scandalous exploits of Georgina Spencer, the duchess of Devonshire in 18th century England.'G' was the original 'it girl' with uncanny parallels to her direct descendant Princess Diana. She was glamorous, popular and adored by an entire country but also haunted by the fact that the only man in England she could not seduce was her very own husband, the Duke. When she tried to find her own way the resulting controversies and liaisons left all of London talking.I especially liked the multilayered take we get from all the characters here. Ralph Fiennes wasn't just the 'evil husband', he was a man of his times, giving a complex and sympathetic edge to his character.I wasn't overly impressed with Dominic Cooper as Charles Grey, a flat forgettable sort, for such a heart wrenching love affair. I did like the introduction of Bess Foster as the other woman or other wife as the case may be and definitely felt G's frustration as her husband continued his adulterous liaison right in front of her while at the same time refusing to allow her to have her own, threatening to take the children.What an involving soap opera-ish storyline with the servants standing and listening in to all the arguments and scandal, forgotten by the players like they aren't even there. 10/12/15",9,0,1,31 October 2015
Independence Day," Taken on entertainment value alone this is a good movie.
","Taken on entertainment value this is a good movie; its big, thrilling, and action packed. The special effects stand up today and I enjoyed the extended cast. On the downside the plot and character development is thin and its corny at times with much gung-ho flag waving as the rest of the world (Brits) wait for America to decide how to handle this Morse code. Great entertainment though.For the most part the story follows Will Smith as an army of alien spaceships attack earth and threaten to destroy the human race. There's a huge cast attached, banding together to stop the invasion with multiple story arcs converging. The initial take down by the aliens is well done, devastating on a global level with fire balls etc. It's one of those movies that I catch myself watching and enjoying every time I stumble across it on TV.I enjoyed Bill Pullman as the president, Jeff Goldblum's banter with his crotchety dad Judd Hirsch. Robert Loggia,Harry Connick Jr, Mary Mcdonnell and a drunken Randy Quaid saving the day.",7,2,4,18 December 2017
No Country for Old Men," A frustrating but great movie
","Somehow I missed watching this movie until now and I think pretty much everything has already been said about it; Javier Bardem's bad hair, the amazing acting from a bunch of talent, the dark, raw plot told through unconventional storytelling - which I'll be honest, made me uncomfortable.This is a modern day western based on the on the 2003 novel by Cormac McCarthy and directed by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen and I have to talk about the ending. Now because I haven't read the book I'm not sure where the blame lies but why was the audience not allowed to see the final showdown between Anton (Javier Bardem) and Llewelyn (Josh Brolin)?After an entire movie of suspenseful cat and mousing, and then nothing. The ending had me saying seriously that's its!? It felt unconcluded. 09.11",8,1,1,19 April 2015
The Fault in Our Stars," Funny and heartbreaking
","Really great adaption of the young adult novel. Enjoyed this one a lot. Funny and heartbreaking. Shailene Woodley & Ansel Elgort are fantastic, seeming very comfortable with each other and are addictive to watch, you don't want their story to end.We follow them from their meeting in a cancer support group and through their whirlwind romance which takes them to Amsterdam to meet the very nasty Willem Dafoe, a reclusive and mostly drunk author of a book that has touched their lives. Ultimately this trip teaches both of them what it means to truly be alive.Willem Dafoe plays the bad man to perfection, Laura Dern as the mother is great. This teen romance felt very mature to me because of what they've both faced. Worth a watch even if your not a teen but be warned, you'll feel kinda wrecked afterwards.",8,0,2,2 March 2018
Bridesmaids," Hilarious as promised
","Well I finally caught Bridesmaids and it was as hilarious as promised. Just a great movie; totally infectious, laugh-out-loud humour from a genius all female cast. This is one of those guy comedies (Bachelor Party, Hall Pass, The Hangover) but with these girls and storyline it transforms into a bit of a chick-flick while also leaving free reign for the gross out gags, hilarious humiliation and crazy situations.The characters are diverse, well developed and although the story's not all that unique I did find myself engrossed and even kinda moved watching Kristen Wiig's downward spiral of shame -mostly by her own making. She plays a devoted maid of honour here who struggles to put her financial and romantic woes aside as she attempts to plan the perfect wedding for her best friend. And she's awesome.No need for me to mention any of the fantastic and hilarious scenes as everyone knows them already (wedding dress shopping). One of my personal favourites though would have to be Wiig trying to get Officer Rhodes attention in a series of drive-by's (speeding, drinking, rapping, flashing). Hilarious.Chris O'Dowd was such a great addition to this cast, I really enjoyed his character and the whole love interest storyline he had with Wiig. Shout out to Jon Hamm's opening love scene too. 5/10/15",8,0,0,14 July 2015
Non-Stop," Definitely worth a watch
","Enjoyed this one quite a bit, it managed to be more than just your straight action film and I liked trying to figure out whodunit from a whole plane load of potential suspects, for a while I even thought Liam Neeson was guilty. Plenty of red herrings throughout to misled you and an exciting (if implausible) closing scene.Liam Neeson plays a familiar role, his stock action hero guy. This could easily be his 'Taken' character actually, just as an air marshal pursuing a hijacker on a non-stop flight from New York to London. It doesn't matter though he does a good job with a decent amount of action considering the limited space, including a hand-to-hand fight in the tiny airplane bathroom.Great secondary cast here too including Michelle Dockery & Lupita Nyong'o as flight attendants, Julianne Moore as mysterious woman and Anson Mount as suspect #15. 1/20/16",9,0,0,16 February 2016
Saving Private Ryan," Excellent
","This was just a fantastic movie. That opening half an hour with the allied invasion of Normandy is like nothing I've ever seen before, unflinchingly gritty, violent, bloody, loud, horrific and brutal. I was actually watching it on the treadmill and had to stop because I was gasping and then sobbing. Probably one of the most realistic portrayals of the horrors of war ever made. This was in your face throughout and doesn't glorify or lie about combat.The movie itself I would have to say is a bit of a masterpiece with amazing attention to detail and Steven Spielberg deservingly winning an Oscar for his stunning war drama. The story follows a squad of US army soldiers on a mission to rescue a GI trapped behind enemy lines in France on D-day after all 3 of this brothers are killed in action.Excellent performances all round but especially from (Tom Hanks) as Capt. Miller leading his men on their perilous mission to locate that one man, Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper who's somewhere behind German lines. I also really enjoyed Tom Sizemore.This movie has so many familiar faces attached and it was interesting (and even fun) seeing all the different actors showing up along the way in the search for Ryan including Adam Goldberg, Barry Pepper, Bryan Cranston, Dennis Farina, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Nathan Fillion, Paul Giamatti, Vin Diesel, Ryan Hurst. 11/11/15",10,0,0,8 December 2015
The Pianist," Unflinching and Oscar worthy
","This was so good, not exactly uplifting but just an amazing story I couldn't take my eyes off of. This movie has been based on Szpilman's book and directed by Roman Polanski with Adrien Brody giving his Oscar winning (and worthy) performance of Poland's most acclaimed pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman and his horrific, unflinching view of life as a Jew in 1939 Warsaw under Nazi occupation.The fact that he survived through this time is miraculous, heartbreaking and not to be forgotten. Brody is just amazing here, losing a ton of weight and just captivating as his family is rounded up and shipped off to the Nazi labour camps and he escapes, spending years living in the ruins of Warsaw.Adrien Brody won best actor Oscar for his role, I was just remembering his Oscar speech, its really amazing too, you might remember him kissing Halle Berry. 08.11 (2)",10,1,2,20 October 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Excellent but something was just... off
","I watched this 4th Mission Impossible instalment immediately following the 3rd and in all honesty I was a bit underwhelmed. I can't quite explain it but this just fell flat for me somehow. That's not even the right word I mean its an excellent movie; gripping, stylish, fast paced with a big budget and multiple globe trotting locations as well as the incredible action scenes and stunts. -Yes this is the movie where Tom (actually) climbs the world's tallest recorded building in Dubai -and yes that an awesome sequence. But something was still just off for me. I immediately missed the old team although I did like the addition of Jeremy Renner. Simon Pegg on the other hand, (as much as I adore him) I preferred in a smaller role, as his slapsticky sidekick routine got old fast here. As a whole I didn't find the story as gripping as I'd expected and there were a lot of long drawn out scenes without dialogue, just stuff happening, like when they're in the Kremlin with the screen. Cool but it went on too long. There were also lots of subtitles and newscasters or voiceovers. It was just a totally different vibe than the other movies, which I guess can be a good thing, to keep a franchise fresh but it took me a while to get with the program here.The story opens with superspy Tom being busted out of a Russian prison, then the Kremlin gets bombed with the blame falling on the Impossible Mission Team. Ethan Hunt then assembles a new team who travel the globe using every high-tech trick in the book to uncover the truth. A few random thoughts: Where's the old team, doesn't feel the same without them I'm feeling a bit bored. His wife is what, just gone? Nice explication for her absence 'after his wife, well you know.' Where do they keep getting all these gadgets from along the way? Its not like they're small and fit in their luggage. Yay more robot like Tom running super fast. Cool sand storm never seen that done before. Okay that was awesome insert heart back in chest(re the building climb and swing back in the window) None of these magic gadgets are working very well Yay an explanation on Tom's wife And some cameos from the old team. Guess that will have to suffice. 6/8/15",7,0,0,26 June 2015
Foxcatcher," Vague retelling with brilliant preformances
","This was a little (lot) vague at times, whereas at the end I had to Google the events that happened to get the whys of it. Based on a true story about millionaire John Du Pont and his relationship with two brothers, Dave & Mark Schultz, Olympic wrestlers he engages to train at his estate so that he can be an 'Olympic coach.' Mark initially idolizes Du Pont but slowly realizes the depths of his benefactors madness.Things are hinted at...sexual misconduct and the actual murder is done in such a vague way it doesn't appear to have any motivation. Its slow at times and sorta feels like a documentary in its style which keeps the viewer at a distance. The make up and acting from all involved is phenomenal though. Steve Carell, wow creepy brilliant job. Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo as the brothers also do a great job.",7,0,0,7 February 2018
JFK," That Magic bullet
","What a fantastic movie, I hadn't seen this in several years but enjoyed Oliver stones controversial version of the events surrounding President Kennedy's assassination just as much in my re-watch as I did back in 92.Led by new Orleans DA Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) Wow, what a cast, it's almost a who's-who here with amazing performances all around; Ed Asner (is a bad, bad man) Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Oldman in particular stand out. That 'magic bullet' courtroom scene is still awesome no matter how many times I see it. In fact this is the kind of movie that needs to be seen multiple times because of the amount of intense dialogue and mind blowing conspiracy theories. This is A list stuff. 11.13",9,2,5,17 December 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A love letter to the silver screen
","Most of, no All of the focus of this movie is on old classic Hollywood, its a love letter, an homage to the 50's silver Screen. Its interesting but there isn't really much of a plot here in terms of a movie. We follow Leonardo DiCaprio as screen actor Rick Dalton and his stunt double turned best friend Cliff Booth/Brad Pitt -both are flawless in their roles- as they struggle to keep pace with the swiftly evolving entertainment industry.While working to continue their notoriety they face the demise of the golden age and also the Manson family which is about the only part of this that feels Tarantino-esque as he again rewrites history and BBQs a couple of people in the pool. The cast of familiar faces taking on bit parts in this movie is a veritable whos-who. I particularly enjoyed seeing Sharon Tate, Bruce Lee, Steve McQueen. Bottom line It's good.",7,3,6,3 June 2020
Get Out," Refreshing and original
","This was refreshing and original, I tend to seek these types of movies nowadays with all the reboots, remakes, part 7's and superhero stuff.Get Out is unique, A very different take on Guess who's Coming To Dinner. It's a bit strange, Hitchcockian. Not really a horror movie, more on the WTF scale. Brain washing, cult like. Chris's best friend was funny, a breathe of fresh air. Is this what America is really like in terms of racism?",7,2,5,10 October 2019
Drive," The movie that makes men love Ryan Gosling as much as women do
","This had been on my want to see list for ages because I'd heard so much about it. Its the movie that makes men love Ryan Gosling just as much as us women do. It's dark, sexy, violent, blood splattered, dreamlike and unique. And while I didn't love it as much as I expected to I appreciate it for being an instant classic and I'm rating it up due to originality -which is super hard to find nowadays.Ryan Gosling is a Hollywood stunt driver by day but as he says 'It's only part time.' By night he's the getaway driver for heist operations. He is one cool character here, unlike I've ever seen him be before. Silent for the most part, speaking only when necessary and showing a range of emotion; tough, sexy, enraged, caring, and oh that smile when we get it. For me this had a real 70's vibe and I should probably give it another watch. 5/16/14",8,0,2,21 October 2014
Peaceful Warrior," Not perfect but definitely powerful.
","The opening scene of Peaceful Warrior hooked me into watching all of it. I had been dubious because of Nick Nolte and the whole spiritual angle -wondering how that was going to play out, but ultimately this was uplifting and inspiring and Nolte was very good as the grumpy, gravelly voiced sensei master.This is the kind of movie that you'd have to watch several times to catch all the quotable/livable meanings.Its along the lines of 'The Karate Kid' (but based on a well received book) following Dan Millman as a gifted gymnast bound for Olympic gold. Initially he has it all; trophies, girls, fast motorcycles, and wild parties but all that changes the night he meets a mysterious stranger in a gas station (Nolte) who holds the power to tap into new worlds of strength and understanding. Dan is sceptical at first but comes to understand that he has a lot to learn about... life.This wasn't a perfect movie but it was sorta powerful. The gymnastic scenes were well done including a freaky dream sequence. A couple of familiar faces from TV in the cast; Paul Wesley from Vampire Diaries and Tim DeKay from White Collar. Now I gotta read go the book. 01/13",8,0,1,4 March 2015
Room," Stays with you
","This was well done, a movie that has stayed with me for days afterwards, much as the book did. Cleverly done screenplay here which must have been hard to write. The story follows a woman only known as Ma and her 5 year old son who live in a small room. It is the only life Jack has ever known. They play games, Ma tells Jack stories. She is often depressed, Jack is bored and full of questions. Eventually the viewer realizes that Ma is being held captive in this enclosed space, Old Nick comes for his rape visits and Jack hides in the wardrobe. Ma has been here for 7 years. The story is hard to watch.They finally gain their freedom and Jack is able to experience the outside world for the first time. Interesting details brought up you wouldn't think about; like the kid can't do stairs, never seen the sun or real daylight, never been alone, or exposed to germs. Jacob Tremblay is amazing throughout Brie Larson shines in the second half, finally breaking down when she is safe and can relax enough to let herself go at her mother's house.
William H Macy (with top billing) is in this for about a second as the dad who can't look at her.",7,0,1,17 October 2019
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Everyone will take something different from this extraordinary adventure
","I thought this was a great movie. Its uplifting, interesting and has an often relatable story filled with beautiful cinematography and a great soundtrack. Its not the usual comedy you'd expect from Ben Stiller although there are still moments where he shines through but this maintains a more calm sense of humour throughout.Walter Mitty works for Life magazine in the negative assets sector. He lives a tedious and safe life, and spends much of his time lost in elaborate daydreams, filled with heroism, romance and action. When his job becomes threatened, Walter takes action in the real world embarking on a global journey in order to obtain a photo negative from the mysterious and elusive independent photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) that the magazine needs for its final issue.There are a lot of messages in this film, I would even say the whole premise is open to interpretation. Does he really travel to Greenland and Iceland? Battle sharks? Escape a volcanic eruption? Climb mountains? Excel at skateboarding -loved that scene- or is the entire movie just another one of his elaborate fantasies? I love movies that create dialogue or make you think and everyone will take something different from this extraordinary adventure. It's open for translation which is another reason I think this is such a great movie. I would definitely watch this one again. 3/6/16",9,1,1,5 April 2016
Across the Universe," I'm not one for the musicals but I can't wait to watch this again
","Wow I didn't think I would like this since I'm not really a Beatles fan but it kinda blew my mind. Just awesome. A really good story set in the turbulent 1960's, with a satisfying romance between an American named Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) and Jude from Liverpool (Jim Sturgess). The movie also traces a small group of friends and musicians who are swept up into the emerging anti-war and counterculture movements, along with the star-crossed lovers, Jude and Lucy.Interesting versions of more than 30 Beatles songs preformed by the cast, complete with cool cameos (Bono, Joe Cocker) and musical numbers with amazingly trippy choreographed dance routines. This was just so good. A couple numbers stood out for me: 'Come Together' with Joe Cocker, just wow, the business people dancing and shuffling on the busy New York street and 'I want You(?)' with the brother getting inducted into the army was downright scary with a very Pink Floyd, Another Brick In The Wall feel to it. I'm not one for the musicals but I can't wait to watch this again. 06.13",10,8,10,4 December 2014
Driven," Didn't hate it, didn't watch it for the racing aspect though
","Well I didn't hate this which I expected to after reading multiple scathing reviews. I didn't watch it for the racing aspect though so I didn't have any problems with the 'physics' of the driving as others seemed to, that was just noise to me. I viewed this strictly on an entertainment level where it worked just fine, even if the love-triangle/romance aspect did wear a bit thin.The actual race scenes have been filmed in a way that reminded me of 'Any Given Sunday', sort of ADD, flipping back and worth between shots of feet changing gears on pedals, hands on steering wheel, speedometer, giant drops of rain blurring vision, crowd shots, hot babes, the pit crew, the boss crew. Its colourful, frenetic, filled with obligatory crashes and pure entertainment.SS wrote the screenplay and takes a supporting role here as Joe Tanto a washed up former driver who is called back by race team owner Burt Reynolds to coach his current boy wonder Jimmy Bly (Kip Pardue) to the world championship.Bly is slipping in the rankings, cracking under pressure from his ambitious promoter brother and it doesn't help that he's also pursuing an affair with Sophia, the girlfriend of his nemesis, top racer Beau Brandenburg.The story for the most part focuses on relationships in the backdrop of Indy car racing. I found the characters all to be multifaceted and we witness them dealing with their individual struggles. Sly plays a sad-sack sort of guy who everyone picks on and I was very impressed with Gina Gershon as his ex-wife, beautiful but what a b!tch. Burt Reynolds face -wow his plastic surgeon was heavy handed with the scalpel, it's pulled so tight it looks freaky. He does a good job with his character though. 1/26/16",8,0,1,17 February 2016
The Bourne Legacy," A new hero, decent enough story and stunts
","This was pretty good. A decent story, good stunts and action. I really liked the inclusion of the parallel time line this runs on, with flashes to the three other Jason Bourne movies.The new hero here is Jeremy Renner, a scientifically engineered, genetically enhanced CIA agent who goes on the run when his program is cancelled and everyone included is ordered eliminated. Along the way he kidnaps/rescues the research scientist (Rachel Weisz) who helped create him.The story opens in Alaska where a bearded Renner as Aaron Cross is training 'Rocky 4' style, climbing snow capped mountains, doing tasks in very cold water and hanging out in the snow. Lots of running, some OK fight scenes...not cool Jason Bourne style but good enough. A couple decent chase scenes too with motorcycles through the streets of Manila.Edward Norton is one of the suits trying to take him out from some office headquarters somewhere bland- he doesn't really add much. Stacy Keach is there and all the other series veterans show up as well; Scott Glen, Joan Allen, Albert Finney.",8,2,3,9 December 2017
Unknown," Almost really good and it reminds me of Frantic
","Lots of twists and turns and some decent action scenes in what has come to be a familiar type of movie for Liam Neeson these days.Dr Martin Harris is in Berlin Germany when he is involved in a car accident, suffers a bump to the head and then awakens days later to find that nobody knows who he is including his wife. In fact another man is claiming to be the real Dr Harris. Ignored by disbelieving authorities and hunted by mysterious assassins, Harris finds himself on the run.This was almost really good, it just fell off the mark a bit somehow and I also have to mention how much it reminded me of Harrison Ford's 'Frantic', its almost the same movie, right down to the roof top scramble out the window. Neeson does a decent job with his version though. I did find that almost all of his interactions with his 'wife' January Jones felt forced and awkward but I think that's down to her, she was kinda terrible. Diane Kruger on the other hand was fantastic as the funky girl he finds himself on the run with.I really liked the twist at the end where suddenly everything that I had thought was far fetched or dumb made sense and even had the thought that it was actually a far smarter movie than I had realized. Maybe they should have revealed 'that' a little earlier. 3/8/15",6,1,1,12 March 2015
Coyote Ugly," A guilty pleasure favourite
","This is a fun, sexy, trashy and sweet movie. I've watched it a couple times now because the dancing on the bar scenes are all kinds of awesome -although as a former bartender I also know how hard the girls are working and this just makes me feel exhausted. I remember those endless busy nights, pasting on a flirty smile and going home with the sunrise all too well.Anyways, I enjoyed Violet (Piper Perabo) here, especially the relationship she has with her dad (John Goodman) The romance angle is kinda meh as is the whole (inherited) struggle to become a songwriter with stage fright in NY. Still it's one of those guilty pleasure movies people don't admit to watching and enjoying. 12.30.13",8,1,2,17 November 2014
Gran Torino," Brilliant and challenging storytelling
","I just loved this movie, sure its tough at times to hear 'Walt' being such a racist ass but I took it in an Archie Bunker kind of way, he's ignorant and we're meant to dislike him for it. Walt is also stuck in a bygone era, trapped with his memories of the war and alone after the death of his wife, a changing neighborhood and grown children he doesn't know or particularly even like. He finds he has more in common with the transplanted Hmong family living next door than his own.This is equal parts hilarious, offensive and heartbreaking. Clint directs and stars (and is awesome) as a bigoted, grumpy Korean War veteran who despite himself befriends the Asian teen that (under threat from gangsters) had tried to steal his car; a mint 1892 Gran Torino. An unlikely friendship that changes both their lives.Brilliant storytelling. Hilarious when he growled at people and yup, Clint can still kick serious ass. I totally choked up during the scene when he leaves his dog with the old woman next door and the ending surprised me. 04.15.14",9,0,3,7 November 2014
The Hurt Locker," How do you go grocery shopping after living on the edge?
","I've seen this twice now and it failed to make much of an impression either time. I figured I must have just missed 'it' the first time around because the movie received so much acclaim, including critics and the Oscars but no, I came away just as indifferent in my re-watch.I can't really figure out why I failed to connect but I think it has might have something to do with the way this is told. There isn't really much of a story, its more of a meandering war narrative, with a bunch of random crazy events/missions strung together without much to tie it all in.The story follows a trio of very different members of the army's elite Explosive Ordnance Disposal squad (EOD) tasked with the nerve wracking job of dismantling improvised explosive devices in Baghdad. (Anthony Mackie, Jeremy Renner & Brian Geraghty) battle insurgents and each other while they search for and disarm a wave of roadside bombs. I like all these actors and they do a great job but again I failed to make much of a connection with them.I did find the closing scene a little heartbreaking as I had wondered throughout how any of these guys could ever go back to a normal life at home after what they'd seen and been through. How do you go grocery shopping after living on the edge? Who do you talk to about what you've seen? who can relate on any level. I had enough trouble relating to people after I returned from a year backpacking in Europe so yeah. 3/9/16",7,1,2,10 April 2016
K-19: The Widowmaker," Intense, scary, gripping -those scenes with the sailors in the reactor
","I'd seen this years ago but enjoyed it way more this time around when I caught it on the History channel. Complete edge of your seat viewing. Harrison Ford is still kind of lame with his dubious Russian accent but Liam Neeson is great as the other nuclear sub Captain. We also have Peter Sarsgaard and Kris Holden-Ried as the Geiger-counting Russian sailor.The movie starts slowly, but gets progressively more exciting as we follow the USSR's first nuclear submarine, which suffers a malfunction in its nuclear reactor during its maiden voyage in the North Atlantic in 1961 -the height of the cold war.The story becomes intense and incredible. With the most memorable scenes being that of the radiation. The scene where the boys are going into the nuclear reactor to fix it gave me goosebumps. The courage it must have taken, especially the second group to go in after they had just seen the first ones return, after only 10 minutes. The state of them blind, puking, burned, essentially melting. Scary stuff and portrayed really well.That this is a true story and that it could so easily have escalated into an all out war... of misunderstanding, is mind boggling to me. I was also surprised that this event took place in 1961 because in the great scheme of things that's not so long ago. 07.11",10,3,4,11 March 2015
Meet Joe Black," A thoughtful, wonderful mixture of comedy, romance and drama despite what my husband thinks
","I originally saw this in the theatre with my husband who fidgeted and laughed his way through it. He absolutely hated it, let everyone know it and talked about what a terrible movie it was for years afterwards. I didn't dislike it then and in re-watching it (by myself) now I really liked and appreciated it. Sure it's too long, with so many scenes stretched out that it could easily have been pared back to a 2 hour viewing time but the story itself about family and the meaning of love, about discovery, seizing the day and sacrifice is just beautiful.The plot is intriguing and has apparently been done before in 'Death Takes A Holiday' which might explain why this had such an old fashioned feel to it, style, music and even dialogue. It follows the grim reaper, who comes to earth to retrieve a media tycoon shortly before his 65th birthday, but agrees to grant him a little more time if the mogul will teach him about life. In the process he falls in love with his guide's daughter.Stand out performances from everyone involved, I love watching Anthony Hopkins & Brad Pitt together on screen (Legends Of The Fall) they have fantastic chemistry and once again Pitt is almost too good looking here. Excellent back up cast too, Claire Forlani as the love interest is lovely in a simple trusting way, Marcia Gay Harden, trying to get her father to notice her and I loved Jeffrey Tambor's character Quince, such a nice man. As Joe Black says 'one of my favourites.' The character of Black must have been a hard one to play and I'm not sure Pitt ever quite got it right, he just felt awkward at times in his wide eyed, robotic and childlike portrayal, in his discovery of life's pleasures and quest for more peanut butter. I will say he provided one of the most ...interesting love scenes I've witnessed on screen, watching death get it on, feeling things for the first time. Oh my! Ultimately a thoughtful, wonderful mixture of comedy, romance and drama that left me thinking about it for days afterwards. 7/27/15",9,0,0,26 November 2015
Grudge Match," Worth a watch...surprisingly
","I was hesitant to watch this and (I'm sure like most others) went in with very low expectations but Grudge Match surprised me with constant laughs, a story with heart and was ultimately way better than I thought it was going to be.Stallone and DeNiro do a great job as a pair of aging boxing rivals coaxed out of retirement to fight one final bout 30 years after their last match. I actually enjoyed DeNiro here which I haven't been able to say about him for ages what with his crappy comedy choices of late and Stallone is excellent even if his character is just another less mumbling version of Rocky, hard to differentiate the two there.What really held this together was Kevin Hart and Alan Arkin, those two are absolutely fantastic. Jon Bernthal and his son balance the mix out nicely and I even enjoyed the Kim Basinger rekindled romance arc.Surprisingly the part I liked the least was the actual fight which just kept reminding me of Rocky Balboa. There are also some very weird waxy CGI flashbacks showing the boxers in their prime, back in the eighties. 3/2/16",7,0,1,4 April 2016
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Loved it
","Wow what a fantastic movie, magical, captivating and visually stunning, there are just so many things to love about it. Including some very quote worthy dialogue and special effects that I've yet to figure out how they did what they did to Brad Pitt -aging him but giving him a child's body and then making him look young again (like Thelma and Louise young). *sigh* The epic-ness of this story as a whole is fantastic, covering Benjamin Buttons entire life and all those that pass through it, there are a lot and his travels take him far but I think for the most part this is a love story. Cate Blanchett plays Daisy, in and out of Benjamin's life, for about 60 years. They again do an incredible job with her makeup and I was totally impressed with the scenes of her dancing which she (may or may not actually be doing) Damn tricky that CGI.The movie is long but never feels it, as there is a big story here to tell. I honestly just think this is a perfect movie. 11.13",10,0,1,2 December 2014
Magic Mike XXL," Aging strippers on a roadtrip
","I wasn't expecting much from this based on the first movie but you still have to see it, right. I'd hoped for a better story this time or more actual stripping but nope, this is more of the same except even worse. Story as it were follows retired stripper Channing Tatum as the band gets back together to put on that 'one last show' at an exotic dance convention in Myrtle beach. For the most part this is a road trip movie and that's about it.There's no real storyline here, no interesting side bars, zero character development, the dialogue is long, meandering and hard to follow (actually I think they made it up as they went along.)There are a couple of cool dance sequences, but no choreographed routines or stripping per se just dance moves (or singing) and aggressive man handling of female spectators. Joe Manganiello does a very sexy act towards the end and I also liked the 30 seconds Channing bumps and grinds in his workshop while attempting to get his groove back and that's about it.",4,0,0,25 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Shut off your brain and enjoy the pretty pictures
","This was my least liked of all the Star Wars movies so far. What has Disney done to this franchise? Okay so here Rey is with Luke Skywalker on an island in (Ireland) she is meant to be learning the ways of the force but Luke is pouting and perpetually grumpy, its boring, Rey then develops a telepathic bond with Kylo Ren who is struggling to master the dark side and has ditched his voice modifier which was the most interesting thing about him. Meanwhile Princess Leia floats in space (WTH was that about?) Finn goes on a risky mission behind enemy lines to a casino where he makes no effort to blend in, frees some space horses but ignores the slave kids.Ultimate takeaway, kinda boring, just action sequences and special effects with no real purpose. I did like the salt planet battle scene with the speeders and the red sand, visually unique, very cool. Super lame jokes and bad one-liners, yikes. Mark Hamill is not utilized in this at all plus his character is poorly written, he does dumb things, its like they didn't know what to do with him so they have him do nothing and then he...On that note are they planning on killing off one original member per movie? Guess so, next one will be Princess Leia for sadly obvious reasons.In the end I just shut my brain off and enjoyed the pretty pictures I remember when I used to have long and involved discussions with my brother about key plot points or character theories.",6,0,6,23 May 2020
The Adjustment Bureau," A small movie feel from a big budget romance sci-fi
","I liked this one; it was a little different, with an intelligent and unique script and small movie feel despite the calibre of actors and available budget involved. Matt Damon & Emily Blunt take the leads here and have genuine chemistry together, they were a treat to watch interact.At the core this is a love story but it's also thought provoking, do we really control our own destiny? and stylish (loved the 50's vibe from the bureau men and their magic hats). I would also call it action-ish without breaking form and going all over the top with explosions and CGI. There is a fantastic, on foot chase scene towards the end. The love story was well done too, believable as was 'David's' reaction to learning of the adjustment bureau. I really liked Anthony Mackie who played the adjuster with a heart.The story follows rising politician David Norris, who learns that his life (and that of space and time in general) is and has been adjusted in order to keep him away from a beautiful dancer -the love of his life. These mysterious men have been grooming David to be the next president of the United States and will do everything in their considerable power to prevent him and Elise from being together.The movie spans several years and I will definitely watch it again some day. 5/10/15",9,1,1,23 May 2015
The Hangover Part II," About as good as the first movie -I mean exactly so you've seen it before
","Well this wasn't terrible. Is this the sequel that everyone hated so much or was that #3? Anyways I liked it about as much as the first movie, even though it was missing that original feeling so you felt like you'd seen it all before and parts did seem forced at times. Actually except for location this is a carbon copy of the original, I still got some laughs though.Bradley Cooper looked good, Zach Galifianakis as 'Alan' annoyed the hell out of me (which I think he was supposed to) I just don't remember him being such a freak in the first Hangover.Once again the photos at the end credits are worth sticking around for and I loved how this time they tried so hard to be good, 'just one beer' and then waking up in Bangkok and tracing their steps which just got progressively more F'd up.Highlights; the Thai stripper reveal, the tattoo, Mike Tyson. 03.04.14",5,0,0,21 October 2014
Prisoners," Dark, moody, disturbing thriller
","Super disturbing, creepy, angry and violent with an absolute sense of dread throughout. One of those movies that I wonder why I'm watching because it makes me so uncomfortable. I'm glad I stuck with this though because it also ended up also being one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.A bit of a slow burn, heavy on the dialogue and maybe too long but masterful storytelling that never went where I was expecting, with many moments when the dots connected and I was like oh wow that's what the significance of 'that' is or he has 'that' to make noise with. Multiple red herrings in the suspect arena too.The acting here is also just fantastic, Oscar worthy performances from Hugh Jackman as he takes matters into his own hands when his daughter and her friend go missing; I have never seen him in a role like this before angry, possessed driven to the point of crazy decisions. Jake Gyllenhaal is also amazing as the detective assigned to the case and Melissa Leo, I didn't even recognize her. Can't go wrong with Terrence Howard or Viola Davis either who play the parents of the other missing girl.Also nice to see a movie (these days) that doesn't rely on special effects, superheroes or crazy action sequences to tell its story. Ultimately one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.4/27/16",9,0,1,6 July 2016
For Love of the Game," 'clear the mechanism'
","I've gotta give this 5 stars because I liked it just as much as I did when I saw it (way) back in 99. It's stood up well. Kevin Costner is excellent as ageing Detroit Tigers pitcher 'Billy Chapel' and looks just like one of the pro's out on the field.Told for the most part through flashbacks, this starts at the end and then goes back, as Billy 'clear's the mechanism' and begins pitching in what could potentially be his last game, as his team has just been sold and the new owners have plans to trade him. Throughout this game he reflects on his life, 18yr career and on-again-off-again relationship with 'Jane' (Kelly Preston) which has also reached a impasse. For the most part this is baseball movie and it gets super exciting as Billy unknowingly nears a perfect game, debates retirement and Jane winds her way through the airport on her way to England.I'm not sure what the critics ever thought of this but I thought it was fantastic; great story, told in a clever way, sweet well portrayed romance and just a classic sports movie. I also enjoyed John C Reilly as Billy's catcher and his relationship with former owner (Brian Cox.) The game has changed. 6/21/14",10,0,1,30 September 2014
Logan," Depressing
","This was a grind to get through, just a sad story about the end of some great characters lives. Logan is living in a hideout near the U.S Mexico border caring for the ailing professor X and working as a chauffeur. He is angry, mean, exhausted, addicted to pills and alcohol, his body is failing and he's just fed up with the world. Patrick Stewart as X is now a bumbling useless old man, on drugs to control his 'spells.' Their sheltered existence comes to an end when a young mutant girl arrives and needs their help to stay safe -she is very good as a sort of young, feral version of wolverine.Anyways trudging through, this ends in a road trip into Mexico, lots of violence, Logan F bombs and is super grumpy. More mutant kids show up, kinda like Mad Max, there is no humour or even a glimpse of hope. I can't understand why this particular story ever came to film or why the high ratings? Depressing.",4,1,2,26 April 2020
Big Fish," Just enjoy the ride
","Bizarre and entertaining story about a son (Billy Crudup) trying to learn more about his dying father (Albert Finny) by piecing together the stories and myths he's heard his entire life, which eventually leave them estranged.Tim Burton definitely brings the imagination to this and Ewan McGregor is excellent as the young William Bloom, can't fault his Southern accent or enthusiasm. Actually everyone involved in the ensemble cast is pretty good.This is one of those movies where you just go along for the ride, like Forrest Gump or Benjamin Button. you never know what's going to happen next or which strange and influential character will cross his path. The father-son relationship is bittersweet as he sets about trying to unravel fact from fiction and I loved the ending. Amusing and magical. 6/19/14",8,1,1,2 October 2014
Friends with Benefits," This tries hard not to be a cliché but I'm pretty sure I've seen it already
","I found this movie super annoying initially and almost shut it off. It did start to grow on me at about the half-way mark though when the storyline got more serious and family members were introduced to take the edge off. It think it also took me that long to acclimatise to the insistent, trying too hard to be funny, ongoing (& going) dialogue Mila Kunis kept spouting. And I like this girl too, but jeez.This is another predictable rom-com with a predictable storyline even though it tries not go that route, but (didn't I see this exact same plot in No Strings Attached?) In this version we follow two friends who try to add sex to their relationship without all the, well, strings. This idea fails (shocker) as Jamie and Dylan find it difficult to keep their emotions at bay.While this movie tried hard not to be cliché it failed. I did find Woody Harrelson's gay sports writer character kinda funny and got sucked into the storyline involving (Richard Jenkins) as Justin Timberlake's father but for the most part forgettable 10.13",5,0,0,25 November 2014
Into the Wild," Into the heart Into the soul
","This is a thought provoking movie that makes me feel something different every time I see it. Haven't we all wanted to ditch our lives and responsibilities at some point and just go wander around? But this is also so much more.Emile Hirsh does an amazing job here which often requires him to act without dialogue as he's alone. He just shows his fascination, hurt or frustration through his eyes. As a big fan of the book I can honestly say that this film adaption is just so well done in all aspects, you really get a feel for what Chris McCandless was trying to accomplish (?) by abandoning his life of luxury and privilege and shunning society on his quest to live off the land in Alaska.I really enjoyed all the characters he met along the way (Hal Holbrook, Kristen Stewart, the hippie couple, Vince Vaughn) and all the amazing scenery. Eddie Vedder's original soundtrack is just awesome too.Ultimately this is heartbreaking and frustrating and beautiful. 10.13",9,1,3,29 September 2014
Green Street Hooligans," Among The Thugs
","This was really good; violent, brutal, raw and unique. Centering around the violent world of British football and hooliganism with a bit of a twist, as this follows an American (played by Elijah Wood). Wood plays a Harvard student who is wrongfully expelled after getting busted for his roommates cocaine and then flees to his sister's home in England.Once there, he is befriended by her charming and dangerous brother-in-law and introduced to the underworld of British football hooliganism.Based on the book 'Amoung The Thugs' by Bill Buford the storyline is intriguing and emotional, the acting was superb here too, one of those movies that totally sucked me in. It has a bit of a 'Fight Club' vibe to it mostly because I think North Americans just don't get the whole hooliganism thing.This also stars a pre SOA Charlie Hunnam. Nice. 4/1/11",8,0,0,26 April 2015
Elysium," I promise you, one day I'll take you to Elysium
","I've seen this a couple of times now and each time it feels like it should be better than it actually is. It's quite predictable and just does not feel original even with this unique dystopian future world they've created, something is missing. Matt Damon just appears to be going through the 'action hero' motions and Jodi Foster as the villain makes up her accent as she goes along. CGI is good, fight scenes well done, I would have liked more shots or explanations of wasted, ruined future Los Angeles, that was interesting, I guess missed opportunities.Story follows Matt Damon working in a robot factory where he gets exposed to a lethal dose of radiation. The only way to save himself is go Off World to Elsium, a giant space station where the rich and privileged live and have the technology to heal in fancy tanning bed type things. He agrees to undergo a dangerous mission which involves making him a living bionic computer. Along the way he hooks up with his childhood girlfriend who he never stopped loving, her daughter has leukemia, also needs a healing bed. Jodi Foster employs Sharlto Copley from District Nine to stop Ben and his band of rebels. Most political or social messages go out the window as this becomes exclusively an action movie",6,2,3,20 November 2019
Taken," Solid action movie, a new classic to the genre
","This is pretty stellar action/revenge movie, with Liam Neeson perfect for what will become his go-to genre. The kick-ass, take no prisoners action hero. The movie is fun to watch, moves at a quick pace and because the bad guys are so bad (sex trade kidnappers) you don't feel much remorse when they get knocked out, maimed, shot, stabbed, electrocuted, dumped overboard, or just plain killed.Neeson plays an ex CIA agent who turns Paris upside down after his teenage daughter is abducted by members of a sex trade gang. Ruthless in his quest, he employs his 'very particular set of skills' in tracking her down and its pretty awesome.On the negative side Maggie Grace is a bit too old to play the 15 year old party dress wearing, boppy teenager and initially 'Bryan' seemed way too (certifiably) obsessed with her wellbeing. The acting is solid though Grace definitely does her bit to act underage and Neeson is intense throughout along with some well choreographed fight scenes, car chases, shootouts, torture sequences etc. Its a classic. 12/28/15",9,0,0,18 January 2016
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," If your not a fan of the books, there is no way you will enjoy these movies.
","Watched this again when I stumbled across it on my TV and couldn't turn it off. The Twilight saga is just such a guilty pleasure for me. Whatever don't judge.This last part of the 'saga' picks up exactly where Breaking Dawn part 1 left us, with the newly turned Bella opening her red eyes after the birth of Renesmee. We then see her training her new abilities, conquering her thirst and realizing her CGI baby is growing at an alarming rate. Oh and thens there's Jacob who has 'bonded' with the child, the whole 'imprinting issue is handled about as well and non creepily as possible with flashes of the future couple.We then see the Cullen's gathering vampire clans from around the globe in order to protect the child from a false allegation that puts her and the entire the family in front of the Volturi under a sentence of death for creating a vampire child, they must prove she was born not made.If I'm honest this last half of the Breaking Dawn book is much of an anticlimax and I'd wondered how they were going to liven things up for the movie version. All I can say there is I Loved 'the twist' well done, very exciting, sorry about your head Carlise! much better than what Stephanie Meyer wrote.The closing credits are excellent, a real tribute to the fans showing the cast from all 5 movies along with passages from the book. It made me feel sad its over. Its also another good soundtrack.",9,1,2,23 March 2018
Invictus," Good but not great
","This was good but not as good as I was expecting it to be what with Matt Damon, Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood directing. Actually it was kind of average with some very long winded sections of dialogue (speeches) and a mediocre outcome to the World Cup.Usually I get all wrapped up in inspirational sports dramas but this final game was kinda meh, with continual cuts back and forth to the crowd, the game, people watching or listening at assorted venues. I guess I was also expecting the movie to be more about the rugby and less about the politics, although I did enjoy the glimpses we get into Mandela's personal life.Truthfully about an hour into the movie the most interesting thing going was the 'rainbow' team of the presidential guard and how they were interacting with each other and handling their new boss. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Nelson Mandela is very good though and Matt Damon puts on a decent South African accent (and certainly got in shape for this role) but the story itself was kinda tedious.It follows newly elected president Mandela as he inspires the (losing) 1995 South African rugby team to strive for the world cup in hopes of soothing the country's racial tensions.",7,0,1,14 November 2015
Mission: Impossible," Fun, exciting, classic and the weakest in the franchise
","Probably my least favorite of the franchise but still miles above most other 'spy' movies except for those Bourne ones. This series also gets better with each subsequent movie. #1 see's secret agent Ethan Hunt framed for the deaths of his espionage team and fleeing government assassins across Europe to find the truth.Everything is well done and the result is fun and exciting despite a kinda choppy story. Great locations, a top notch cast and filled with awesome stunts (the giant fish tank explosion in the restaurant, the now iconic Cruise suspended mid heist inches from a pressure sensitive floor, and the amazing train ride/helicopter sequence) which by the end goes way OTT but looks cool and as I said its fun so who cares. 9/1/14",6,0,0,24 September 2014
Super 8," works as a tribute film
","This very much reminded me of those early Stephen Spielberg films or Stephen King books/movies from the 80's. Its basically an homage to those (Goonies, E.T, Stand By Me) even going so far as to take place in 1979.We follow a group of friends (including the obligatory fat kid) in small town Ohio as they attempt to film an amateur movie for a school project. While filming they witness a train derailment (big special effects here and pretty cool) and then an otherworldly force begins to stalk their town. Of course it's only the kids that know what's really going on as the army descends and adults scramble.I'd be curious to see what the young adult crowd thought of this? It didn't do much for me. I don't know though, I can still watch ET and feel the magic, the magic was missing here. As a tribute film however this works just fine. The completed zombie movie shown during the credits was good. 6/2/14",6,0,2,8 October 2014
Up," Adults will enjoy this just as much as the kids
","This was funny, poignant, heartbreaking, inspirational and brilliant. The first half an hour also nearly had me in tears which was not what I was expecting from a Disney Pixar film, so unexpected, sad and beautiful.I honestly think this is a movie adults will enjoy just as much as the kids and Ed Asner is cast perfectly as 78-year-old balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen, just the right amount of grumpy.'Carl' finally fulfills his lifelong dream of travelling to South America when after tying thousands of balloons to his house it floats away. Along for the ride is 8 year stowaway and Wilderness Explorer Russell who continues to remain optimistic despite an evil villain(Christopher Plummer) talking dogs and a rare bird named Kevin.The talking dogs were hilarious and real in their thought process. I loved the squawking bird here too. The house looked amazing with all the balloons tied to it, thanks to Pixar. I will definitely watch this again one day. What a beautiful story. Oscar worthy.

Woman in Gold," Priceless

'Maria' finds documents in her late sisters possessions proving that several priceless paintings stolen six decades earlier from her family during WW2 by the Nazis are now in the possession of a museum in Austria.With the help of ambitious young lawyer Ryan Reynolds Maria starts legal proceedings in various countries to recover a portrait of her beloved aunt known as the woman in gold, now considered a national treasure by the Austrian government.Enjoyed this movie, parts of it are done in flashbacks with the fantastic Tatiana Maslan playing a young Maria just as the Nazis are taking over Austria and rounding up the Jews. Helen Mirren is brilliant as expected. Ryan Reynolds role could have been played by anyone and he wasn't notable at all.",7,0,0,31 January 2020
Invincible," You come away from this one feeling like the you can do anything and that's always a good thing
","I've seen this a couple times now over the years and always really enjoy it. Its hard not to, another one of those inspirational sports-underdog stories that has you invested and cheering for a down on his luck local hero.Mark Whalberg puts in a great performance here as Vince Papale, he's a hero we can relate to, just an average neighborhood guy trying to get by in a tough economy, working as a bartender after he loses his teaching job due to budget cuts, his wife has just left him (and a 'nice' note) proclaiming he will never amount to anything. Vince gets his chance when the Philadelphia Eagles announce open tryouts for the team. At 30 and never having played college ball he doesn't expect this to lead anywhere, instead just decides to take the opportunity to stand on the same field as his idols.The story here is very similar to 'Rocky' with the Eagles taking the place of Apollo Creed (actually when I think about it there's too many comparisons to count so I won't go there) It's a great movie regardless, lots of interesting secondary characters to get invested in, with the whole neighborhood garnishing hope from Vince's success, a budding romance, a coach that is very likable (Greg Kinnear) yet also out of his depths with this losing team.This has been put on by Walt Disney Pictures so there is a certain amount of sugar coating to how this story has been told. The soundtrack is excellent transporting you back to the mid 70's I especially enjoyed the real footage cut in of Papale after the outcome of that all-important Big Game. He looked ecstatic.You come away from this one feeling like the you can do anything and that's always a good thing. 10/19/15",8,0,1,29 October 2015
Limitless," An original and intriguing story idea, a good movie
","I liked this a lot. An original story idea following a yummy Bradley Cooper as Eddie; an aspiring author who overcomes his writers block with the aid of a new drug that unlocks the full potential of his brain. NZT allows him to recall everything he has ever read, seen or heard, learn a language in a day, and comprehend complex equations. He also forges into a partnership with a powerful businessman (Robert DeNiro) while suffering side effects and trying to evade the bad guys, intent on getting his stash.Considering the top billing DeNiro was kind of a non-issue here, he has a very small role. I liked the scene in the park where 'Lindy' -the girlfriend escapes the bad guys via NZT, running skills and the sharp blade of a skate.I did have a few problems with some of the ending scenes being kinda silly, such as the easily accessible 'safe house' with the breakable windows allowing the bad guys to get in. Still, a good movie. I would love a few of these pills. I would love to be able to access more of my brain, have more energy, learn a language, figure stuff out. 7/12/15",8,1,1,29 July 2015
Rocky," The ultimate underdog
","I'm huge fan of all the Rocky movies. I couldn't even tell you how many times I've seen them over the years but I still cheer along with every single viewing and find myself all caught up in the struggle, heartbreak, training montages, music, love story and that final 15 round, blood splattered, go for glory, give it all ya got, fight.I'm actually at a loss as to explain why this movie moves me so much? Maybe it's because I've always loved an underdog and this is the story of the ultimate underdog; a man whose whole life centers on a million to one shot. It's also about going the distance and in the case of this original movie, losing but winning the girl anyway. 02/13",10,0,0,18 February 2015
Shine," Really?!
","Agh really!? I was expecting a lot more from this based on Oscar nominations and all the rave reviews it received. Possibly not my kind of movie or maybe I was just missing something but I didn't enjoy this at all and was bored throughout. I actually stopped and checked out IMDb part way in to make sure I was watching the same movie as everyone else. Yup I was.Told in three parts, Geoffrey Rush does do a fine job as Australian piano prodigist David Helfgott but honestly I was more impressed by Armin Mueller Stahl as his abusive, insecure father and Noah Taylor as the adolescent David, who shows the moment of his mental breakdown after preforming Rachmaninoff's technically demanding Piano Concerto No. 3.Now that was a good scene even if it's left a little unclear as to why and what happened directly afterwards. Glad that's over with. 04.05.14'Geoffrey Rush won an Oscar for his performance in this true story of Australian pianist David Helfgott, who burst on the competition scene at a very early age, but whose star potential was shattered by a nervous breakdown.'",2,0,2,6 November 2014
Jack Reacher," Average crime thriller with Cruise doing his generic action hero performance
","I'd been looking foreword to watching this but ultimately wasn't overly impressed. I actually found it kind of dull and long winded, which is a weird thing to say about an action movie, but something was just off and it seemed to drag.I've only read one of the Jack Reacher books and initially didn't care about the casting but what I found happened here was that this just became another Tom Cruise vehicle with him redoing his generic action hero performance and adding some bad one liners. What was up with those cheesy one liners anyway, very dumb.What I do remember from the books was that Reacher read a bit like Sherlock Holmes, very smart, analytical and one step ahead of what's taking place. He was cool not a bully as Cruise came across here. The story/mystery also felt very 80's and wasn't even all that interesting, just your standard old school action crime thriller.Back up cast included David Oyelowo, Richard Jenkins, Robert Duvall and Rosamund Pike as a sort of Bond Girl.10/27/15",5,0,1,9 November 2015
In Time," Original and inventive sci-fi thriller that becomes an okay action movie
","I absolutely loved the premise of this inventive sci-fi thriller. The movie itself was just okay, taking on a 'Bonnie and Clyde/Robin Hood' vibe while still remaining intriguing enough with the time gimmick and a lot of action scenes.Set in a future where time is the currency, people stop aging at 25 and then must purchase more time in order to stay alive, which gives a whole new meaning to the class system. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is targeted by the 'Timekeepers' (Cillian Murphy) after he is gifted time by a wealthy suicidal old man (Matt Bomer), putting him on the run as they think he stole the time.The story idea felt very original and a little trippy at times because everyone looks the same age, fathers-daughters-grandparents etc. And while this did peter out into just an okay action movie I thought about the 'time is currency' idea for days afterwards. 11.13",8,1,2,17 December 2014
The Happening," Crazy town
","This movie is crazy. Crazy whacked. It would have to be up there as one of the worst & weirdest movies I've ever seen, compounded because the cast and director should have known and done better. Some of it is just unbelievable, as in I can't believe the bad dialogue, bad acting and story that is so out there that it makes almost no sense.Its violent at times and others just plain nuts.I also have a hard time accepting that this was meant to be a horror movie; people running away from the wind because the plants are releasing toxins that cause an outbreak of bizarre mass suicides. What?! Not scary. Huge plot holes too and weird moments of comedy thrown in. Then there's crazy Mrs. Jones, this must be the true horror part I've been waiting for? Zoey Deschanel (with her super big eyes) just seems oblivious throughout...la la la and Mark Wahlberg, well he tries his best, he probably is the best thing in this. 6/29/14",5,0,0,30 September 2014
The Fountain," Nope, not for me but I keep trying
","I've tried twice now to get through this and failed. I just can't get into the story or follow it. Too trippy, convoluted and just plain confusing, as the viewer tries to muddle their way through 1000 years and three supposedly 'parallel' stories concerning 'love, death, spirituality, and the fragility of our existence in this world.' I found the 3 stories just too random; Hugh Jackman is some sort of sword & sandals dude leading his men into battle, he has a shaved head and is floating around in a snow globe all Buddha like, he is a consumed Dr searching for a cure for his cancer and (bathtub ridden) wife.Granted maybe this all comes together a bit in the end but I couldn't force myself to put up with it until then even with Jackman and some nice special effects. Pretentious, imaginative, ambitious, visually stimulating = boring. 9/6/14",2,1,6,24 September 2014
The Departed," The mob movie
","I always have a hard time getting into mob movies and this was no exception. The first hour did have me glued to the screen but after a while all the violence and f-bombs blurred together and I stopped paying close attention. I also got fed up with all the flip phone action (were they new and cool in 2006 or something?) Anyways they drove me crazy.The cast is a veritable whose-who; Jack Nicholson is, Jack and he's awesome, as are Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg. They play two sides of organized crime in South Boston as the state police wage war on Irish American organized crime. A young undercover cop Billy Costigan is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello (Nicholson).Despite the two distinct sides portrayed here I still felt everyone was bad, just bad for a different cause. And the ending, 'head shots' the first one was completely brilliant and surprising in a WTF just happened kind of way by the 3rd or 4th time it was just overkill (pun intended) and lost its value. 09.13",7,0,3,12 November 2014
Die Hard," A classic
","Tense, surprising funny, good script with a realistic portrayal of an action hero who isn't invincible and bleeds ...a lot.This was really good, just a classic action movie. I think what makes it so good is that its not just an action movie for the sake of action, there is an actual story here too. You also care about the hero, there's an excellent bad guy (Alan Rickman) and some great sub characters too. Its also funny but not clichéd with bad one liners.My initial thoughts are; It's 1988 and things have changed; Bruce has hair, smoking in the airport, smoking in the limo, smoking period. Taking a gun on a plane in your holster is fine, cocaine is an acceptable party drug, tape decks. Anyways revisiting the 80's was fun.The story follows NYC cop John McClane who is visiting his estranged wife at Christmas. He turns up at her office party and proceeds to be in the wrong place at the wrong time or right place depending on how you look at it, anyways terrorists take over the LA high-rise in an attempt to steal 600 million from a 'high tech' safe. John must take down the bad guy and rescue his wife. Its going to be a long night.Classic. 12/25/15",8,2,4,13 January 2016
American Made," Tom Cruise Made
","Based on a true story of an airline pilot in the 1980's who is recruited by the CIA to (at first) take photos over Cuba and then later to smuggle drugs and weapons for the U.S government. Barry Seal slowly gets in over his head when he becomes involved with the Medellin drug Cartel.This story could have benefitted from a different lead, Tom Cruise is just his MI character, the same action guy as always just with a different background and it sucked the movie down for me so that I wasn't watching a true story about Barry Seal but a Tom Cruise action movie.Its entertaining enough and plays out like 'Scarface' or Johnny Depp's 'Blow'. All the money, so much money he doesn't know where to keep it after a while. Interesting unbelievably true, worth a watch.",7,2,3,4 October 2019
The Holiday," Right movie, right time its a win for me
","The Holiday caught me in the right mood, right time and I loved it. Fully embracing my inner chick-flick I savoured the romance, the gorgeous scenery, the hugely entertaining supporting cast and even the wardrobe -Cameron Diaz wears some great coats here. Why I noticed this I'm not sure, I don't usually, it might have been the wine. Anyways the movie is also pretty funny, and while somewhat predictable I still found myself all caught up in the assorted story lines.This is along the lines of 'Love Actually' or 'Brigitte Jones Diary', with an ensemble cast telling the story of an American (Cameron Diaz) and a Brit (Kate Winslet) who swap houses after their love lives go awry and they decide they need a change of scenery. Diaz finds herself in an idyllic British cottage but quite out of element in the snow and solitude and wants to leave almost immediately, until she meets and hooks up with the absolutely charming (yet mysterious) Jude Law. Law is gorgeous both in character and looks here, he's hard not to fall for.Meanwhile Winslet is living it up in sunny LA where she hits it off with an elderly neighbour played by Eli Wallach -honestly this may have been my favourite storyline going. She also meets Jack Black who was a bit of a surprise in the romantic leading man role but he plays it straight for the most part and it works. The story focus more on Diaz and Law than Kate and Jack and yes it gets all wrapped up quick and tidy for the HEA, but its also totally enjoyable and even a bit magical if you can catch this in the right mood. 12/25",9,1,1,29 January 2016
Crazy Heart," Yup, super good.
","A bit of a slow burn though as we follow country star 'Bad Blake' on his (essentially) 'Washed Up' tour, which now sees him playing in dive bars, bowling alleys and as an opening act for former protégés. 'Bad' drinks his way from town to town and we get a pretty good idea about his hard living life when he meets up with 'Jean' a young reporter who is taken in by his former glory days and all the heartache and pain. 'Bad' is the epitome of any sad country song you've ever heard.I really liked this, Jeff Bridges does an amazing job, giving a raw, intimate and unflinching look at his character and is worthy of his Oscar nomination, even if this did remind me of his portrayal of Rooster Cogburn in 'True Grit' (except that you could understand what he was saying here). The movie ultimately went in directions I didn't expect -I kept waiting for the tragedy and I was also pretty bowled over when Collin Ferrell showed up, wondering how he was going to pull off a southern country singer? He did, very believable. Maggie Gyllenhaal was awesome too, I always like her. 04.18.14",9,1,1,19 October 2014
Love Actually," Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world
","One of my all time favourite movies. Those opening lines from Prime Minister Hugh Grant always catch me 'Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport...'I caught it on TV again this Christmas and watched it yet again. I seem to watch it every year and enjoy it, always finding one of the stories more significant than the others depending on what's going on in my life at the time. This movie always gives me a laugh and leaves me feeling good. Why don't they make more movies like this?",10,10,16,12 September 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Inventive 'Groundhog Day' sci-fi thriller
","Edge Of Tomorrow was a good mix of sci-fi, action and special effects while still maintaining decent character development and an exciting story. This wasn't all about the special effects. Tom Cruise finally beginning to show some age here (52) but can still carry a blockbuster action type of movie. Emily blunt was also very good, believable, tough and sexy.A pretty inventive sci-fi thriller following Cruise as an officer (who has never seen a day of combat in his life) as he is thrust onto the battlefield as a soldier, repeatedly reliving his own death as he is killed on the battlefield while defending Earth from advancing alien invaders. Finally he seeks the help of a celebrated female warrior in order to defeat the extraterrestrials and save mankind.Sometimes 'Groundhog Day' type movies can be a bit too repetitive but with each subsequent redo here this managed to still remain fresh with some new bit of info Tom and the viewers experienced.",8,0,1,24 November 2017
August Rush," Unique love story/urban fairy tale- yeah I fell for this big time
","A unique and somewhat magical love story that really grabbed me. I liked everything about this, even if did require some imagination. It's an urban fairy tale about a 12 year-old prodigy (Freddie Highmore) who heads to New York City to find and reunite with the musician parents who unwittingly abandoned him as baby.Highmore is amazing as musical prodigy 'August Rush' and I have to say that Robin Williams was exceptionally creepy as 'The Wizard', I liked seeing him play the bad guy here -what a great part for him. I also enjoyed the two romantic leads (Keri Russell & Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and while the ending is a bit over-the-top it still managed to make me smile. 10.13",8,0,0,24 October 2014
Ice Age: Continental Drift," This group of adults had a blast watching
","I watched this on a very slow day at work with 4 other adults, thanks to someone's Netflix account. Considering this is a 'kids' movie its worth mentioning how much we all laughed, were super entertained and except for the occasional customer glued to the screen.I suppose they have recycled ideas from the previous films but I only ever saw the first movie years ago so this felt fresh and fun to me, jumping from action sequence to action sequence and filled with brilliant, even beautiful animation. Even our oldest and grumpiest staff member had a smile on his face.I think the thing that surprised me the most here was seeing Peter Dinklage's name attached in the credits,. He voiced Captain Gutt the bad Orangutan pirate captain, what a fantastic accent he put on, I never would have guessed it was him.I enjoyed the story here too following the gang as an earthquake sets an entire continent adrift. They use an iceberg as a makeshift ship, which launches them on an epic seafaring quest where they encounter sea creatures, battle ruthless pirates and explore a brave new world. There is romance and I loved seeing squirrel again who had even that 'odd customer' stopping to watch with us. Isn't it about time the prehistoric squirrel got his own feature film?",7,1,1,19 October 2015
American Gangster," One of the essential American crime movies
","Excellent movie on all counts, a crime epic telling the early 1970's rise to power of Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) alongside detective Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe), the N.Y cop trying to nail him. I liked how both of these men followed moral codes, just on different sides.Directed by Ridley Scott, it's pretty much essential crime movie viewing, reminding me of 'Scarface' and up there with 'The Departed, Casino, Goodfellas, Carlito's Way, The Godfather, and Blow.' The story is well put together and absorbing although I'll admit to never being completely swept away, maybe because it didn't seem all that original. Still it's filled with atmosphere, style, a clever (interesting) plot. It's gritty, violent -but probably not as much as you'd expect, with excellent performances from Washington & Crowe.The cast is also a veritable who's-who and definitely part of the fun in seeing who will turn up next. (Armand Assante, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Common, Cuba Gooding Jr.,Idris Elba, Josh Brolin, Norman Reedus) There are a couple of brilliant scenes that definitely stand out here; Denzel walking up to Idris Elba in the middle of a busy street and showing all of Harlem who's in charge now, in a very violent and shocking way. Another favourite would be Crowe (and backup) waiting outside Sunday church for Denzel, its all very civil and beautifully shot. The final big bust is also awesome, tense, violent and chaotic. 4/20/15",8,1,2,9 May 2015
Dark Shadows," The beginning of the fall of Depp
","Dark Shadows is one of those movies that you expect to be excellent with Johnny Depp vamping it up all comedic, with a cool 70's vibe, but somehow this still falls short. The story itself is good -interesting which sees Barnabas Collins (Depp) turned into a vampire by a witch, then buried alive. Two centuries later, he is freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. Returning to his ancestral home, he then aids his dysfunctional descendants.There were lots of things I liked here; the special effects were kinda dazzling including Johnny playing dress up (again) and damn did I ever laugh at that violent love scene (up and down the walls). The fact that it took place in the 70's was fun, groovy baby, and Michelle Pfeiffer did a good job as the family matriarch.Watching Barnabas struggle in this modern world was also initially amusing but truthfully most of the really good bits were shown with the trailers on TV. Ultimately I felt kinda meh about the whole movie, I can't put my finger on why this wasn't better though. 08.13",5,4,6,21 January 2015
Lord of War," Enjoyed Cage, the dark humour and wow that opening sequence
","This was a good movie immediately sucking me in with that opening credits sequence 'the life of a bullet' Wow! Very cool and unique but still... Lord of War felt original but I guess you could compare it to any of those episodic rise and fall of the (good) bad guy movies; Scarface, Blow, American Gangster.Apparently based on real events it sees Nicholas Cage playing Ukrainian immigrant Yuri Orlov who becomes an international arms dealer, trying to stay one step ahead of the law and ultimately confronting the morality of his work as he is chased around the world by an Interpol agent (Ethan Hawke). The story covers many years and locations and is one of Cage's better roles even though he again plays a sardonic somewhat emotionless character. I liked him though and enjoyed the dark humour, especially in his narration. Jared Leto plays his brother, I always like him, so not much to say there, nice eye candy. The ending, regarding 'the voice' (Donald Sutherland) and who he represents is pretty brilliant. 9/3/14",8,1,2,24 September 2014
The Good Shepherd," A moody slow- burn spy thriller
","This was still a tedious, slow-burn of a movie and I will admit to not always having a clear idea as to what was going on and having to pay close attention to the dialogue, as a lot of it is spoken in riddles. A cast of heavy weights is what really makes this watchable.The story starts in 1961 at the CIA covert operations during the Bay of Pigs and then follows Edward Wilson's career in flashbacks. Matt Damon takes the lead here, his character is serious, self contained and hard to get a read on. Damon seems to play a lot of these 'silent' characters.It continues to flip back and forth between the 40's and 60's; Damon is a student at Yale, his recruitment through the Skull & Bones fraternity, a shotgun marriage to Angelina Jolie (in a small role), his early spy years in London during WW2 and the blitz (which was re-created well) a couple of affairs, the cold war and disillusionment and distrust with the agency.Along the way he rubs shoulders with Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, Joe Pesci, John Turturro, Timothy Hutton, Patrick Wilson, Robert DeNiro, William Hurt and Eddie Redmayne plays his son.I wouldn't say this was a great movie, it tries hard, has a stellar cast, nice cinematography but takes itself too seriously and ultimately is slow, dry and confusing in sections. There is also zero action (if that's important to you). As for Matt Damon's character, as the Russian says 'the silence is deafening'. 1/25/15",6,0,1,21 March 2015
The Terminal," A charming, simple movie that I can't say anything bad about
","The Terminal is charming, feel-good and sweet, directed by Stephen Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks so really, how can you go wrong? I definitely enjoyed this, it wasn't perfect and won't leave any lasting impressions but its one of those movies that just makes you feel good. The entire story takes place in JFK airport (which I understand is actually a set) surrounding Eastern European traveller Viktor Navorski. Just as Viktor arrives in New York his country enters into a civil war and his visa is cancelled leaving him stranded in the airport. With limited English Victor manages to survive what becomes months in the arrivals lounge. Gaining employment, friends and even entering into a brief romance.Tom Hanks of course does a great job playing Viktor, his accent is addictive and he is a simple, sweet man. Personally I would have liked a bit more background on his life before JFK but for whatever reason his character is left vague and never fully developed. What really makes this movie though is not so much Hanks or Viktor but all the people he meets and becomes involved with while in the airport.The secondary characters here are fantastic; Stanley Tucci as the airport boss and bad guy -love to hate him, the baggage handlers (Chi McBride) & (Diego Luna) and (Zoë Saldana) as an immigration official. And wow did I ever fall in love with grumpy, paranoid, wet floor watching, plate spinning janitor Gupta Raja (Kumar Pallana), he stole every scene he was in.Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the love interest, she's a flight attendant who Narvorski tries to have a thing with but she's all tied up with a married man. I liked that they kept the romance as a side story and didn't turn this into a straight out romance.All in a pretty fantastic little movie that kept my interest, gave me some laughs and left me feeling good. 12/16/14",8,2,2,13 February 2015
Prometheus," Tries hard to be epic but is just another oops we released the alien sci-fi
","I thought this was supposed to be a smart science fiction movie, I mean it was really hyped as the next '2001' or something when it came out, but this was so full of plot holes and dumb mistakes or things that are just plain ridiculous that I don't even know where to begin.The special effects/CGI are impressive and I did enjoy the opening scene with the white alien and the whole origins of man theory. I also liked the premise where the crew of a (2093) spaceship embark on a voyage to a distant planet in hopes of discovering these origins based on cave drawings and interstellar maps but jeez.All along this felt like it was trying too hard to be unique or epic, taking itself seriously in a very pretentious way when really the plot is like so many other sci-fi disaster, oops we released the alien movies I've seen before.To begin with this is a 'fairly' important mission, with a one trillion dollar budget, a team of the best scientists and then some (seemingly criminal) blue collar workers thrown in (?) and damn do they make some dumb mistakes along the way. I won't get into all the instances but one example; Charlize Theron has her own personal medical pod but when it comes time to use it, huh, its only programmed to be used on males. Wouldn't she have checked it out before they left? Okay, I did enjoy Michael Fassbender as Data I mean David, a great character who steals every scene he's in. And in the end I liked that this was a prequel to 'Alien', it made zero sense but it was still kinda cool. 12/3/14",5,1,2,16 January 2015
Wonder Woman," Goodbye brother
","This was average on all counts, nothing new or exciting but mindlessly entertaining. Gal Gadot is beautiful and I did like her as Wonder Woman but the movie equally belongs to Chris Pine who kinda steals the show. The origin story is good, interesting, starting on the island of women, lots of battle training with scantily dressed alpha females, very peaceful, then an American pilot crashes into their island home and Princess Diana of the Amazon decides to join him on a journey to the outside world to stop the god of war.I liked the WW1 storyline and that they had the whole movie take place during this time. Lots of action, entertaining, tons of CGI as expected. The ending, wow, ruined it for me, when the plot becomes Star Wars with a fork lightning battle and the bad guy asking Wonder Woman to join him on the (the Darkside) and together they can rule the (galaxy.) I kept waiting for Ares to say 'I am your father.' Just terrible didn't the writers realise this?",6,0,4,26 May 2020
Taken 2," Almost identical to the first movie and on that note, you've seen it all before
","This was okay, not as exciting and kick-ass ruthless as I remember the first one being. Still a decent story utilizing many of the tricks that made the first movie so good i.e. the phone call -you will be taken (in this case 'we've been taken') Stay calm and do the exact (random) things I say -geometry problems, throw a grenade out the widow.Liam is cool though, I like him in these action roles and the plot was feasible enough as it sees retired CIA agent Bran Mills and his family being targeted while vacationing in Istanbul by the vengeful crime lord father of one of the men he killed in the first Taken. Bran is then forced to fight an army of killers in order to get himself and his (mostly unconscious) ex-wife back home alive.Its almost identical to the first movie, tons of action, some cool fight scenes and while not great, still entertaining. 11/2/14",7,0,0,30 November 2014
Step Up," I get it now -Enjoyed this way more than I expected to
","Okay, so now I get what all the fuss is over Channing Tatum. Holy yum! He is perfect for this role, in a predictable, fairly dumb, yet also utterly addictive movie.Channing plays Tyler Gage, a troublemaker and street dancer living with his foster parents, who after vandalizing an elite performing arts school gets the opportunity of a lifetime in the form of community service (janitorial duties) at the school. He then gets 'discovered' dancing in the parking lot by ballet dancer Nora Clark who just happens to need a new partner and some fresh choreography. In turn this could gain Tyler the chance to earn a scholarship.The story here isn't super original but the dance sequences (and music) is really good, and watching Channing move in those loose fitting jeans is all kinds of good. The romance and side stories also sucked me right in. Ultimately I enjoyed this way more than I expected to. 03.13",8,0,0,9 February 2015
Vanilla Sky," This grew on me with a second viewing
","The first time I watched this (years ago) I just didn't get it, but for whatever reason this time around I thought the story was pretty brilliant. I love figuring things out and there was a lot to wade through here. What's real, what's a dream. Who are the antagonist (s) Is David crazy? Who is Julie Gianni? I also liked how this movie turned into a sci-fi about half way in. Yeah, wasn't expecting that but it worked.Strong performances all around and a lot of whoa, that's cool moments following Tom Cruise as a self indulgent publishing magnate whose life of privilege is changed forever following a car accident.The mask was an interesting prop and I liked the scene where David wears it backwards in the nightclub, freaky. 05.13",8,3,5,29 October 2014
X-Men: First Class," A great time witnessing the formation of the 'X-Men'
","This is a prequel to the X-men saga and fans of the marvel mythology universe will love it. The special effects are awesome, the plot is decent and its just super fun discovering how all the characters came to be. The cast is also like a whose-who of stars, top notch including several fun cameos and an homage to Patrick Stewarts hair that really made me laugh.I loved the bromance between James McAvoy as a young Charles Xavier and (Michael Fassbender) who hasn't yet become Magneto, watching them discover their powers, working together before they became arch enemies. I never fully engaged in the whole cold war/nukes storyline but I did enjoy witnessing the formation of the X-Men and discovering their origins.In all honesty this probably deserves a higher rating but its not my favourite movie genre so I couldn't fully appreciate it for what it is. 09.13",6,0,0,15 December 2014
The Wolverine," Entertaining with some great action scenes but far from perfect
","Decent enough movie although far from perfect showcasing (an often) shirtless Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine in an X-Men spin off. This opens with Logan living as an Alaskan bush man (bearded, drinking lots, camping in the open woods) as he's still mourning the death of Jean Grey. He then travels to Japan to visit a dying old friend and learns that there's a way he can remove his immortality, but soon gets caught up in a conspiracy involving his friends devious family and the Yakuza.This was a bit all over the place as parts of it were very good and others were long, drawn out (even a bit dull at times) It is filled with some great action scenes though (the train sequence was cool, the funeral/Yakuza kidnapping, the final battle with the Samari 'Real Steel' robot -exciting) and Hugh Jackman looks amazing, wow he must have spent some hours in the gym.I liked the flashback sequences to WWll in Nagasaki. I didn't really understand the propose of the Jean Grey dream (fantasies?) especially when Logan is sleeping with other women. I liked that this took place almost exclusively in Japan -refreshing. There were some things that didn't make sense (like Logan's claws) and just assorted other plot holes I chose to ignore. The motivation from the bad guys was also a bit vague but whatever.As a whole, an entertaining movie though, make sure to watch past the closing credits for a bonus scene. 9/19/15",7,5,8,1 October 2015
Win Win," Unexpected hit for me; fun, charming, heartwarming and felt very real
","This turned out to be a more than decent dramedy. I didn't know anything about it going in but based on the rave reviews decided to give it a shot. I have to be honest I'm not a fan of Paul Giamatti, I appreciate that's he's a great actor but for (whatever) reason I've never enjoyed him in a movie until now.He was just superb in this and even though he was involved in some questionable business dealings you were still on his side the whole time. The entire cast was fantastic here, really rich (and real) characters) working through an entertaining and very human feeling story. The films pacing was perfect too with a tone that goes seamlessly from dramatic to comedic.The story follows a struggling small time lawyer and moon-lighting wrestling coach who makes an unethical decision to earn some extra money by becoming the guardian to an elderly client (Burt Young) suffering from dementia. Unexpectedly this decision also soon results in Mike having to care for the old mans troubled grandson when he shows up needing a place to stay. Kyle just happens to be a brilliant wrestler though, and in need of a real break in the stable family department. Everything is win-win until Kyle's mother turns up, fresh from rehab and flat broke, threatening to derail everything. 1/3/16",7,1,1,31 January 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," Thrilling, epic, visually stunning and bring on Bane
","I should start by stating that I'm not a fan of the Batman movies (commence 'not helpful' voting now) However I did really enjoy Dark Knight Rises. Obviously I can't get into the complexities of the trilogy or offer my opinion to the superheroes universe but this was a thrilling, visually stunning and ambitious movie.The storyline had an epic feel to it. And I suppose (for whatever reason) part of me enjoyed seeing The Batman, Bruce Wayne brought down a notch as this opens with him a wanted vigilante, his reputation tarnished after the events of The Dark Knight. Wayne is now crippled and living a self imposed exile with only his (awesome) man servant Michael Caine to keep his head screwed on. Truthfully we see more of Bruce Wayne than Batman in this movie which I liked.Eventually though Bruce must don the costume once again to save Gotham and its police force who are struggling to cope with the brutal guerrilla terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy) -a fierce villain possessed of tremendous physical and intellectual strength.Bring on Bane, who (except for the voice) was a fantastic bad guy. I loved every scene he was in, its just too bad he had to suffer such a lame ending. For such a powerful character this was a huge letdown. Speaking of... we also get Catwoman thanks to Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as police officer Blake - I'm sure we will see more of him. The extended cast was fantastic. I also enjoyed the (tricky) ending. Now I know the answer. 9/1/15",7,0,4,20 September 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Anticlimactic
","I enjoyed this more than I expected to based on reviews. The movie is long with a relatively complicated story but entertaining. The visuals/special effects are excellent, its action packed and has numerous great actors in it. I liked the beginning and middle. Flashbacks, rescues, differing philosophies about what kind of heroism is needed to protect the world, Lex Luther begins his reign.The actual battle between Superman and Batman which the movie spends ages working up to is anticlimactic, coming to an abrupt end when they realize their mums have the same first name and they should be friends and work together. Huh really! The final battle with some giant kryptonite creature was also pretty dumb.For some reason Wonderwoman shows up to help and there is a cameo from Aquamnan who I kept expecting to return at the end but guess Mamoa was busy. I struggled with Jesse Eisenberg as Luther, he just didn't work. Regarding the ending...I didn't see that coming.",6,0,3,15 November 2019
Toy Story 3," Transending age and genre.
","This was a pretty genius movie, transcending age and even genre as it achieves everything that a live action would just with animation. I surprised myself by getting all caught up in this jailbreakish Pixar movie and even emotional towards the end. Beautiful, hilarious filled with exciting action scenes and a great story.The third and (I suppose) final Toy Story takes place several years after the last and sees Andy preparing to leave for college. His mother wants him to either box his old toys up and put them in the attic or donate them to a nearby day care. The gang mistakenly ends up at the day care and then this turns into a bit of a jailbreak movie as the toys hatch a daring escape plan, evading the evil huggy bear and his 'baby' bodyguard. Lots of fun new characters and situations; Ken the swinging bachelor Barbie was hilarious, Spanish speaking Buzz. The ending definitely put a limp in my throat. Recommended for everyone.",9,0,1,11 January 2016
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Sexy, witty, charming, Spanish love triangle vacation
","Woody Allen's film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, is a sexy flick about a ménage-à-trois between Javier Bardem, Penélope Cruz and Scarlett Johansson. Need I say more? It's also the first Woody Allen movie that I have made it through in its entirety. Not sure exactly what that says about me? This was a sexy, clever and interesting film though, with beautiful views of the Spanish city. In fact its sort of a love letter to the city of Barcelona.The script is witty, playful and charming with the story following Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Johansson), two young Americans who decide to spend a summer in Spain where they meet a flamboyant artist (Bardem) and his beautiful but insane ex-wife (Cruz). Ultimately this made me want to drink a lot of wine 04.11",7,1,3,13 April 2015
Live Free or Die Hard," Old school action movie awesomeness. Just enjoy the ride
","Well this was just all kinds of awesome in a very over the top old-school action movie kind of way. Shut your brain off and enjoy the ride as we once again join John McClain (Bruce Willis) in a stunt-filled forth instalment, this time facing off against technoterrorists in another wrong place wrong time scenario.This was so much fun with tons of bullets, explosions, car chases and amazing stunts (hello leaping onto in flight jets and taking down helicopters by launching police cars at them) The entire cast is great too; Justin Long provides comic relief as 'Farrell' the hacker who Willis is entrusted with 'bringing in' and I also enjoyed Maggie Q and Timothy Olyphant as the baddies. Intriguing (and somewhat scary) story premise.Top moment. McClain shoots himself through the shoulder to take down the terrorist behind him. Now that's bad ass! 01.27.14",9,2,2,6 October 2014

","I liked this one especially the first 3/4 of it, the end goes a bit silly. Its a cool movie, very Luc Besson identifiable, his style. Great action sequences, interesting locations China, France- I always like to see movies not specifically in America.Very interesting and unique story idea -that humans only use 10% of their brains and Lucy can break this barrier and reach a whole new level in human evolution. Scarlett Johansson is amazing here, impressive, when she first gets kidnapped so scared then as the drug leaks into her system so badass.Morgan freeman -much as I adore him often does these sort of cameos in movies these days and not much acting. He is good here as the sympathetic scientist... Just thinking he was also in that movie with Johnny Depp, Transcendence very similar story, he does more here.",7,6,8,11 October 2019

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I've got a bad feeling about this.
","I really wanted to be able to give this high marks, I was SO excited to see it in the theatre, it was like an event for me and friends, the return of Star Wars but I just can't, I can barely talk about it, super disappointed, nothing original just a complete rehash of all the plotlines from the 1st and 2nd movies. What with all the hype surrounding this I just hadn't seen anywhere how bad it is, well it's bad.Rehashed story is a continuation (remake) of the epic space saga following an ex-stormtrooper, a scrappy desert dweller and a droid who embark on a journey that brings them face to face with heroes of the past.Ok a few notes; I loved the opening, made me feel like a kid again 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... ' The action sequences are breathtaking from beginning to end so much so that you almost don't have time to realize the lack of originality in the plot, yet another 'death star' to deal with -couldn't we have had some 'new' threat to deal with? Did not like the casting of Adam Driver as the child of-- and bad guy or seeing all the familiar faces in assorted cameos which took me out of the moment. Liked the two new leads, good chemistry and will work well in future sequels, particularly the defecting Stormtroopers storyline (Fin) which was really the only original thing going on here.All the plotlines are rehashed, some humour, good end set up for future sequels which I guess will take place with Ewoks on Endor), Harrison Ford was actually Han Solo and not just another grumpy old man which was refreshing, sadness, I still can't believe that happened! Where the hell was Luke all movie, why wasn't he utilized until the last 20 seconds. I'm out of this new Disney franchise.",7,0,1,22 May 2020
RED," Fun action movie from a top shelf cast
","Red was a fun movie. Stylish and witty with a good mix of humour and action. Sure it's also ridiculous at times but it has its moments, how could it not with a cast this impressive.Bruce Willis is always a good time and I enjoyed his relationship with Mary-Louise Parker, who is very funny here. 'Worst first date ever.' 'I thought you'd have hair.' He plays a retired hit man here who, along with his former colleagues try to find out why they've been targeted for death by their former organization.Helen Mirren steals every ass kicking, classy dame, fancy dress wearing scene she's in, absolutely hilarious. And then we also get Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Richard Dryfuss and a very yummy Karl Urban.Some great action scenes, several laughs and while it loses itself a bit along the way I was still satisfied. 7/15/13",7,0,0,15 June 2015
Flight," I talked about the crash sequence for days afterwards
","I really liked this, especially the first hour. The section with the plane in a nose dive and the ensuing crash was super exciting and really well executed. I actually talked about it for days afterwards, how calm 'Whip' was as he tossed out instructions to his panicking co-pilot and stewardess, inverted the plane and crash landed in a field. It was amazingly well done.The movie floundered a bit after that, still an interesting and for the most part heart wrenching story, heavy on the drama side of things. Denzel Washington gives a fantastic performance as a veteran pilot who successfully lands a commercial airliner following a disastrous malfunction and is then hailed a hero by the public, but a subsequent investigation threatens to expose his history of substance abuse.I was also impressed by a terrific back up cast. John Goodman's character provides some (much needed) comic relief as Whip's buddy Harling, the man with the goods, also (as always) enjoyed Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood. Someone I didn't know before but who managed to captivate while she was on screen was Kelly Reilly as Whips girlfriend/recovering addict. I'd initially been wondering why they were showing her parallel story arc.I did find this movie interesting in how all sides get their lawyers together and try to blame each other; the airline, the parts manufacturer etc all hoping not to have to pay and trying to blame the pilot who regardless of if he was drunk or not, the plane broke and he saved lives.And in an alcoholics fantasy sort of way all the shots of the alcohol look particularly delicious; as its poured down the sink on the farm and the Shangrila-ish mini bar in the hotel. Great movie. 10/5/15",9,2,4,20 October 2015
Final Destination," 'We say that the hour of death cannot be forecast.'
","Good movie, starts out a bit lame but pulled me. The concept is great; that of survivors of a plane crash being stalked by 'death' and taken out one by one. The film does a good job of setting up the suspense, who will get killed next but more importantly how, providing red herrings for a few surprises. The deaths are creative, dare I say fun and not as gory as you'd expect.I can see how this movie spawned a franchise. Enjoyed Sean William Scott, he was funny.",7,1,1,16 November 2019
A Night at the Roxbury," One of my guilty favourite comedies
","This movie is such a guilty pleasure for me. I don't know how many times I've seen it now over the years, but every time I catch it on TV it still makes me laugh. Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan are embarrassingly good as loser, poser brothers Steve & Doug. Trying their hardest to get into the best club in town, 'score' with some hot chicks and stop working in their father's silk plant store. I love how this movie just takes it to the next level with their coolness. The music is good, if dated now and there's a great supporting cast here too. It's just a fun time.The scene at the end where the brothers make up after their big fight and it feels like its going to be a big climatic romance kiss is too funny. This is one of those comedies that you don't take anything away from but you'll get several laughs while you're watching it. 01/13",9,3,3,19 May 2015
Godzilla," Entertaining reboot
","This was a decent enough creature feature and about what I expected. At least the special effects didn't completely overshadow the whole movie here and there was a pretty good story attached. On the downside all the characters are kinda flat and underdeveloped especially from Aaron Taylor-Johnson who is the main hero dude.Bryan Cranston might be the exception, but he (consciously?) overacts his role as Joe the grieving father/scientist/Godzilla conspiracy theorist. There is a decent back story set up for him though. Elizabeth Olsen is in the wife/mother role and this could have been done by anyone. Ken Watanabe also very flat, a grumpy sort of non character. They all take it seriously though, and this is an entertaining movie.The visuals are beautifully done and I enjoyed the story with Godzilla emerging from hibernation to battle winged creatures called Motos, threatening humanity. I also liked the new spin put on Godzilla where he is the good monster, helping to save civilization and bus loads of children from the evil, nuclear loving, ever mating Motos. Wasn't too sure about the spin put on history regarding Hiroshima etc -changing history- but decided to just let that go.Lots of mayhem and destruction, as cities are leveled (which is always fun to watch), some excellent battle scenes with colossal destruction from the creatures, lots of globe trotting through Japan (Vancouver), Hawaii, Las Vegas, and San Francisco. Mostly filmed in and around Vancouver through; Steveston, Victoria, Nanaimo, New West",7,2,3,27 January 2017
Looper," Unique, twisty time travel with a great first half
","Super smart, twisty and mind bending. Looper is probably the kind of movie you need to watch a couple of times to totally get all the brain exploding time travel elements. Unique sci-fi story though and action packed. I don't think I've ever seen gangsters represented quite like this before.It takes place in 2074, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is 'Joe', a 'Looper', a hired gun for the (future) mob who send their targets back for him to dispose of. When they decide its time to 'close the loop' they send back an older version of himself (Bruce Willis) to kill, which puts them both on the run.Unique idea with an ending that was not at all what I was expecting. There is also a significant story change in the second half with the introduction of Emily Blunt and her gifted son and I have to say that was when I stopped being quite so interested. It was great to see Bruce Willis actually doing some acting here though, I've seen him in too many roles lately where he all he seems to do is show up. Levitt is excellent too, I've yet to be disappointed with him. I'll be watching this again.11/1/14",5,0,1,5 December 2014
50_50," Friendship, love, laughs and survival
","This was pretty good, but I guess because I'd heard so much about it when it first came out I was expecting more. I was also severely distracted by the fact that this was filmed in Vancouver (subbing as Seattle) so that I kept thinking things like; where's the cemetery in Stanley park? Nice day for a jog under Lions Gate bridge. Anyways that's just me.There are several humorous moments along the way as Kyle (Seth Rogen) tries to keep Adam's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) spirits up through his 50/50 survival rate cancer diagnosis, his treatment, subsequent pot smoking and loss of his bee-atch of a girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard). She is very good in those types of roles.Adam is a pretty dull, dry character, the one scene that he got me in however was right before he goes in for his surgery and he's so scared, turning to his mother for comfort. Very raw. I also liked Anna Kendrick as the bumbling therapist. Great cast here. 12/25/13 'I'm peeing right now.' That line cracked me up.",7,0,0,17 November 2014
Windtalkers," Over the top, pyrotechnics dream -And then there's Cage
","Wow, what a cheesefest. Very much a 'Hollywood' war movie in a completely over the top way, with endless rounds of gunfire and big, bright explosions that sees soldiers diving and rolling away from the pyrotechnics (Captain Kirk would be proud).Yeah where to begin with this? Disappointing on almost every level with ultra cheesy battle scenes containing enough fireworkie explosions that after a while your eyes glaze over. We also get a melodramatic Nicholas Cage who borders on (is) comedic in his overacted delivery of a battle fatigued Marine. 'Oh no Tommy come on, come on. Noooooooooo!' His character is often so ridiculous that I was actually laughing during scenes that should have been very serious.The story itself is okay and has been loosely (oh so loosely) based on a real-life operation during WWII, following two Navajo radiomen and the U.S. Marines assigned to protect them (at all costs) as they encode military messages in their native language. This idea of the code talkers is compelling but unfortunately lost in this pyrotechnics dream, too bad.I did enjoy Adam Beach as Private Ben and his transformation from naïve reservation family man to eyes wide open, I've witnessed horror soldier. There are some other familiar faces here amongst the troops; Mark Ruffalo, Christian Slater, Jason Issacs. I would have to think though if you were a WW2 veteran this movie would be insulting. 11/15/14",5,0,2,29 November 2014
Spectre," Sufficient Bond fare
","Enjoyable enough Bond movie filled with what you'd expect: crazy stunts, car chases, exotic locations, beautiful women, a nasty bad guy, Nice fitting suits, (dirty) martinis, Bond being Bond.Honestly this is a fairly forgettable entry to the franchise, nothing wrong with it and better than most but also the weaker of the Daniel Craig entries. Spectre resumes where Skyfall left off and sees 007 discovering a cryptic message during Day of the Dead festivities in Mexico City. An intense action sequence ensures (as we'd expect from an opening sequence) and the remainder of the movie sees Bond on a (worldwide) trail attempting to uncover a sinister organization led by the (underused) Christoph Waltz.Lots of exotic locations (Rome, Austria and Morocco ) a couple of beautiful women including (finally) an older bond girl and some excellent hand to hand fight sequences, one of them on a train.I don't usually take much notice of the 'cinematography' in movies but this was just beautifully shot, every scene framed and lit perfectly so that it could be a photograph. The scenery, the buildings the way Bond stands/poses, the cars.Ultimately it was too long though, we started laughing about the extensive wardrobe Bond somehow manages to keep finding in his tiny suitcase as he circumnavigates the globe; assorted sunglasses, multiple suits, business casual, white tuxedo, alpine ski wear, flashy track suits, safari gear -must be one of those spy things you don't ask about. It didn't matter though, Craig looked great but its one of those things one only notices when their mind starts to wander from the story.For the most part, it's sufficient enough Bond fare.3/1/16",7,0,1,29 March 2016
Joy," A rags to riches story that never really grabbed me
","Joy is a bio-pic of entrepreneur Joy Magano, a divorced mother of two who risks her life savings to create the miracle mop. The success of that product leads to a home shopping empire and her rise to the matriarch of her family business dynasty.It was pretty good, Jennifer Lawrence is always a treat so watch on screen, she is so compelling, but if I'm honest this was also kinda meh. A rags to riches story that never really grabbed me. It just wasn't compelling and dragged at times with very little character development. I always felt like this could have been more than it was showing. The A-list cast doesn't even help move things along. There is also some weird soap opera stuff here that went on way too long including Susan Lucci and Donna Mills from the view of her shut in mother.",7,0,1,11 October 2019
Her," A quirky romance showcasing social loneliness
",A quirky endearing romance focusing or quietly showcasing social loneliness. Excellent performance from Joaquin Phoenix as a lonely writer in the not too distant future who falls for his computers operating system. As the voice of Scarlett Johansson -as his software- draws him out of his shell he struggles with a difficult divorce from his childhood sweetheart. A good supporting cast in a unique and quiet sorta movie unfortunately it wasn't enough to fully capture my attention. I will watch this again one day though.,6,0,0,1 December 2017
Slumdog Millionaire," Beautiful, gritty, hopeful and exhausting
","Visually stunning, moving, gritty, violent and hopeful. Not sure if it was worthy of all the awards it received but a movie I'm very glad I saw. I liked the way Jamal's (Dev Patel) story was told, clever storytelling there, following a Mumbai teen who grew up in the slums and became a contestant on the Indian version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' He is arrested under suspicion of cheating, and while being interrogated, events from his life history are shown which explain why he knows the answers.If I'm honest I didn't really 'enjoy' watching this, I found it exhausting even though it's a very good movie. It just gives such an unflinching look at poverty and exploited children that even with the beautiful love story and closing dance sequence I still came away depressed. I usually love these types of movies too but Slumdog hit me on a base level that really affected me. For that reason alone I have to give it a high rating 7/19/14",9,1,3,29 September 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Proved me wrong
","This was better than I was expecting, even with all the rave reviews I just didn't think I would like it as I'm such a huge fan of the originals. I figured it would get Hollywood-ized with Charlize Theron looking like a post apocalyptic starlet, all pretty and clean and then CGI'd so that it lost that cool unique atmosphere of the original. Neither of these things were true.Set in a sun parched post apocalyptic future, we again follow loner Max (this time he is Tom Hardy) as he gets caught up in the plight of a group of warrior women as they flee from an evil ruler/dictator across a desert wasteland. Most of this movie is one big car chase, which actually isn't a bad thing, full of high octane stunts its pretty awesome and also keeps the atmosphere and tone of the originals perfectly with lots of weird, crazy characters. Its desolate, futile and Hardy is mostly silent. Theron does a good job, doesn't look pretty.Even though I was surprised that I enjoyed this and that ultimately it is a good movie I'm still not sure it warranted all the accolades it received.",8,2,4,15 March 2018
The Runaways," Decent if slightly disjointed rock bio
","This was pretty good; dirty, raunchy, in your face and capturing the spirit and essence of the mid 1970's perfectly.The story follows the conception and early days of 'The Runaways' an all girl punk band that took the world by storm and focuses mostly on the tumultuous relationship between Joan Jett and Cherie Currie.I'll admit to questioning the casting here and initially having a hard time excepting Dakota Fanning in the role of sex-kitten junkie Currie. She does a fantastic job though and her downward spiral was the part of the story that interested me the most. I'm not a huge fan of K-Stew but she looks just like and captures the toughness of Joan Jett really well. I did get tired of seeing her in leather pants in every single scene though. The clothes and hair in general are super fun, the music is great, the story as a whole felt kinda disjointed. Michael Shannon is suitably weird/sleazy as their manager. 8/12/14",6,1,2,25 September 2014
Me Before You," 'You only get one life. It's actually your duty to live it as fully as possible'
","Tear-jerking romantic drama about a young woman who accepts a job as a caregiver to a former investment banker who was paralyzed from the neck down in an accident. Her no nonsense, goofy ways force him to reconnect with life and the pair eventually develop feelings for one another.This movie belongs to Emilia Clarke, you just can't take your eyes off her happy, quirky, goofy, expressive, exceptionally nice, what expression will her face take next character. And what weird clothes will she wear be wearing? Great supporting cast here too especially enjoyed Stephen Peacocke as the nurse and fellow GOT alumni Charles Dance as the dad.I was a huge fan of the book, it broke my heart (understatement) and they've done a decent job here of telling JoJo Moyes story.",8,2,2,1 February 2020
Gladiator," I was entertained even 15 years later
","Hard to believe Gladiator is 15 years old now, such a fantastic movie that will never go out of style. Super fun watching this again, it's just the classic sword & sandal flick, epic on all counts and the type of movie that stays with you for days afterwards. Admittedly the story was also a bit draggy in parts, its almost 3 hours long and at times I was confused as to where it was taking place Morocco? but the location issue is just me.Russell Crowe is Oscar worthy as he embodies Maximus. Perfect as the strong and silent leader, the type of character you feel for and can't help but cheer along especially as he's squaring off against the awesomely crazy & creepy Joaquin Phoenix 'You will love me and bear me a pure heir' -spoken to his sister. Phoenix was just amazing.Of course the battle scenes are awesome; exciting, bloody and epic, starting in Germany with Russell as a Roman general leading his men into battle. He soon arouses the rage of the emperors jealous and bloodthirsty son when it becomes known that Maximus is to be the successor. A bit of murder happens then with Maximus finding himself a widower, beaten, enslaved and forced to become a gladiator. The final battle goes down at the Coliseum in Rome with an ending that I thought was perfect 'Am I not merciful?' Really beautiful music here too, and a top notch extended cast including a SOA sighting from one Tommy Flanagan. Yes Maximus, I was entertained. 4/14/15",9,1,2,31 May 2015
The Wedding Singer," 'I wanna grow old with you'
","One of my all time favourite Adam Sandler movies -truthfully I don't watch anything he puts out anymore but this is a classic.I'm not sure how many times I've seen it over the years but whenever I catch it on TV it still always makes me laugh as I sing along. This movie is of course especially great if you grew up in the 80's and remember all the 'awesome' music and hair. The music is a huge part of this movie but all the 80's references are fun and then there's Billy freaking Idol on the plane. Excellent secondary characters here too.The story is a little hokey following Robbie, a singer (now reduced to working weddings) and Julia a waitress, two very sweet people who are engaged to the wrong partners. They meet while working a bar mitzvah (I think) and become friends.Drew Barrymore is Julia the love interest, helping Robbie through a bad breakup and then getting him to help plan her wedding. These two have definite chemistry together and you really hope they'll get together. All it takes is Billy Idol. A guilty pleasure favourite movie for sure.",10,3,4,28 April 2015
The Pursuit of Happyness," Exhausting, hopeful and well done
","Wow this movie was exhausting. Watching Will Smith as Chris Gardner continually running to keep up, catch up, make ends meet, just make it through one more day did me in. Awesome (Oscar nominated) performance from Will Smith -and his son Jaden too.This is an inspirational fact-based story that really gives you hope concerning a struggling salesman who becomes an unpaid intern with a prestigious brokerage firm as he and his young son become homeless.Particular detail has been paid to small details of the time (1981) including movie posters, adds etc. The bone density scanner almost becomes a character unto itself here, I actually got tired of it and was probably as glad as 'Chris' was when he finally sold the last one. Neat cameo from the real Gardner at the end. 02.09.14",8,0,0,27 October 2014
The Bourne Supremacy," Bourne takes a magazine to a knife fight and wins
","I didn't like this quite as much as the first movie but it's still super good and an excellent follow up in terms of story and well, everything else too.Bourne still can't remember who he is and is still on the run, hiding out in Goa India and having flashbacks when the agency frames him and... does some other nasty stuff. He heads back to Europe (Berlin & Russia this time) and then goes gunning for agency higher ups, re-entering the life he had wanted to leave behind.The final car chase sequence with Karl Urban (as the bad guy) is probably one of the best I have ever seen, it kinda blew my mind, absolutely amazing. And my favourite fight scene would have to be when Bourne takes a magazine to a knife fight and wins, just awesome! 11.13",8,2,2,23 December 2014
The Great Gatsby," Enjoyed this lavish adaption
","Enjoyed this one, an adaption of the classic novel following Toby Maguire as aspiring writer Nick Caraway. I liked Toby's narration and how the story was told from his perspective after he moves next door to aloof millionaire Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). The two from a friendship... of sorts as Gatsby throws ever elaborate parties in the hope of rekindling his romance with Nick's unhappily married cousin Daisy. While these celebrations are spectacular some of the dancing/party scenes went on too long.It's a visually stunning film with glamorous costumes and lavish production design, to the degree that it looks almost artificial or cartoony at times especially the New York scenery/bridge sections.I liked the music (Jay Z ) even if it was jarring because it is so far removed from the period this is set in. Toby's character while, yes meant to be an observer actually got to be a bit creepy as he is always lurking around watching with no real development on his part -flat.Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic as Jay Gatsby, displaying mystery, ego, madness, shy, nervous, longing and ultimately sad and lost. Joel Edgerton, also impressive as was Jason Clarke as George, a scene stealer I'd never head of before.",7,1,1,1 March 2018
The Proposal," Way funnier than I expected
","This was really funny, way better then I thought it was going to be as I'm not usually one for the romantic comedies but The Proposal was kinda clever, had a feasible storyline, great actors (Ryan Reynolds, Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson) and some genuinely hilarious moments. As well as the gorgeous scenery, a male stripper scene (ha) and well, Betty White! What more do you need? I actually laughed out loud in a couple of scenes and Sandra Bullock looked gorgeous especially nude, eat your heart out Jessie James.Here Sandra Bullock forces Ryan Reynolds to marry her in order to avoid deportation back to Canada. 09.11",8,0,1,10 October 2014
Hustle & Flow," Gritty and moving
","Terrence Howard turns in a perfect performance as a pimp, pusher and aspiring rapper, working all the angles to get his first record made and leave the mean Memphis streets behind.This is a gritty and moving story. Its raw (in places), dark and believable, and of course the music is great, I've had that Oscar winning song stuck in my head for days now. Some excellent sections of dialogue too...'I'm here trying to squeeze a dollar out of a dime, and I ain't even got a cent man.' Howard is fantastic but I also reallyfell for the sub cast of extended family and friends; Taryn Manning,Anthony Anderson, DJ Qualls, Taraji P. Henson, all these charactersshow varying degrees of desperation.",6,0,0,2 December 2017
Warm Bodies," A fresh twist to the zombie genre -cute and heartwarming
","This was cute, funny and kinda heartwarming giving a fresh twist to the zombie genre. Based on the book by Isaac Marion, the movie managed to capture 'R's' self deprecating, sarcastic and humorous voice especially in the beginning, as he describes his 'life' to the viewer, what an average day is like for one of the undead shuffling around a post apocalyptic airport. The beginning of this movie was super good. If I'm honest though I did find parts of this(maybe even as a whole) a little slow.R is kinda tortured, seeking a connection as he feels there must be more. After he rescues 'Julie' from a zombie attack the two form a relationship and he experiences a profound transformation, becoming increasingly more human. There is a definite Romeo and Juliet vibe going on here as Julie is the daughter of a military leader (John Malkovich) charged with eradicating the undead. Their romance aspect was cute.Teresa Palmer plays Julie and at times reminded me of Kristen Stewart, something about her look and the frown in her brow, her awkwardness. Nicholas Hoult does an excellent job as R, I enjoyed watching his transformation, his struggle with speech, memory, making his body work properly. I also liked Analeigh Tipton and Rob Corddry in their BFF roles. Dave Franco has a smaller 'brainer' part.The soundtrack mostly consists of 80's music and I should mention the 'Bonies'. They're the bad zombies here and reminded me of those stop motion sword fighting skeletons from that 1963 movie 'Jason and the Argonauts'. Very jerky looking. Not sure if this was intentional or not? 7/1/15",8,1,3,21 July 2015
Sully," A bit dry if I'm honest
","This wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be, kind of dry actually. Clint Eastwood directed this bio pic about airline pilot Sully Sullenberger depicting his successful emergency landing of a disabled airbus on the Hudson river in Jan. 2009 .In the aftermath, that takes up most of the movie Sully must endure sudden, unwanted fame and the FCC trying to prove fault with his decision even though he saved everyone on board. Insurance companies right?! The viewer spends a lot of time following the inquest and watching what if scenarios on flight simulators. Tom Hanks is fantastic throughout, there's a good back up cast with Aaron Eckhart as the copilot and Laura Linney but after the actual landing the rest of the movie was dry, a bit jumpy and even repetitive.",7,0,2,25 October 2019
Valkyrie," High suspense, top notch cast and a history lesson
","This was very good even if it did tend to drag in a couple spots. The level of suspense is pretty high throughout though and the cast is filled with heavy weight actors. Its been based on the true story of a rebel German army officer who along with senior German officers and politicians led a plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and overthrow his ruthless Nazi regime during World War ll.Now of course you know the outcome isn't going to be favourable but I still caught myself hoping and somewhat shocked by the final scene. I also had no idea that these assassination attempts on Hitler even took place, so I learned something here as well. The opening battle scene in Africa is very well done. 08.13",8,0,0,22 December 2014
The Soloist," Foxx is amazing in an okay movie
","Jamie Foxx is Oscar worthy in this, simply amazing, was he nominated? The movie itself is good/okay. It follows Steve Lopez, a down on his luck (and hurting) Los Angeles Times journalist who, while looking for a new article to write about for the paper befriends a homeless Juilliard-trained musician. Foxx plays the schizophrenic former violin prodigy and balances well with Downey.Some moments did feel long winded as we (I guess) enter Nathaniel Ayers' mind and listen to the voices and music with him. I was never much impressed with the music here. Downey is...Downey. Good and kinda cocky as per.The scenes with all the homeless people at the shelter was like something from another world and very impressive. I also appreciated that we are allowed to see the violent side of schizophrenia, Steve Lopez didn't just 'fix' Ayers for a Hollywood HEA. 06/13",7,0,0,22 January 2015

With meager supplies he must find a way to contact Earth, make oxygen and grow some food. Its very funny and Damon seems to be having a great time.It did feel a bit too long but in saying that I also can't think of any scenes that were unnecessary. Great special effects and finally a movie using CGI and green screens to enhance the movie not just BE the movie as is often the case these days, where movies forget about a story and just become special effect extravaganzas.It gets a bit over-the-top towards the end with Damon in his Ironman reminiscent suit but I went with it.

","So I watched another Oscar worthy performance this weekend in The Fighter, well several Oscar worthy actually but Christian Bale stood out in this movie, basically stealing every scene he was in.How he manages to transform himself from one movie role to the next is just amazing. Here he plays a skinny, twitchy, toothless crack addict with a Boston accent.The movie itself was really good too, I've always been a big fan of the boxing movies (blame Rocky) and this is the real life story of Irish' Mickey Ward and his trainer brother Dick Eklund on the rough streets of Lowell, Mass. Chronicling Mickey's struggle to emerge from the shadow of his half brother Dickey -a former champion who lost his career to crack addiction- and also his dysfunctional family, who cripple as much as support his aspiring boxing career.A solid movie, albeit predictable, and filled with strong performances from Melissa Leo as the mother (what a piece of work) and Amy Adams as the girlfriend. Mark Wahlberg does a good job but does tend to get overshadowed. 9/16/15",9,0,0,20 April 2015
Law Abiding Citizen," Super entertaining revenge thriller, with a twist
","I enjoyed this one a lot despite the ridiculous ending. Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler both do a decent job, Foxx plays it cool as the driven prosecutor/dad and Butler, well I was definitely rooting for the bad guy with his character... up to a point, then he just goes from anti-hero to psycho/serial killer, very violent and kinda scary actually as he is unstoppable. A clever plot in that respect.'Release me by 6am.' 'Or what?' 'I kill everyone' -Hard to have much compassion for 'that' guy.The story follows Butler as Clyde Shelton, a family man who takes justice into his own hands after his wife and daughter are brutally murdered in a home invasion and his hotshot prosecutor fails to deliver justice. When a plea bargain sets one of the killers free, he wages a deadly vigilante campaign targeting not only the killer but also the district attorney and others involved in the deal.I liked figuring this one out. Initially not much makes sense and I was surprised by the 10 year time leap as we try to understand why Butler lets himself get arrested (naked) and how he is able to do what he's doing from behind bars. How is he his own accomplice? (this made a whole lot more sense once it was revealed that he had been a former spy/assassin). Sure its all a bit absurd at times, more violent than I expected too but an original thriller that tries to make a social statement; the system is corrupt. 3/17/15",8,0,1,28 March 2015
High Fidelity," Cusack conquers the role
","I loved how this was filmed so that John Cusack (Rob) talks to the camera/audience while going about his messed up life as that of a record store owner and compulsive list maker. He really pulls you into the movie this way and its kinda hilarious watching him suffer an (I don't want to grow up) pre mid-life crisis as he recounts his top five breakups,including the one in progress.I have to say though I actually preferred the book by Nick Hornby and I guess that's why I had a hard time with the Americanized version, I think this would have worked better had it taken place in England.Cusack conquers the role though and is thankfully not as depressing as his literary version. Jack Black stands out as his wacky clerk, as does Lisa Bonet and an American (and very beautiful) Catherine Zeta Jones. 07.13",5,0,0,1 December 2014
The Island," Excellent action/sci-fi thriller with an intricate look at clone society
","I really liked this sci-fi action thriller about a society of clones who try to escape their faux Utopian world when they learn that they are actually harvestable beings, being kept as a source of replacement parts for the wealthy. I loved the intricate look we get into the intriguing, clone world, very cool.There are definite elements of 'Logans Run' and 'BladeRunner' here, and some of the action scenes upon their escape are breathtaking thanks to Michael Bay. It does reach a point though where I found it to be action just for the sake of action. Ewan McGregor is a bonus (and pulls double duty here) although honestly there's not much chemistry between him and Scarlett Johansson, that's just a weird pairing. All-in a great cast; Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, Sean Bean (ha, poor Sean), Djimon Hounsou. 09.13",9,1,1,10 December 2014
