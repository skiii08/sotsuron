The Ring," Cant get it out of my head
","Having just watched The Ring a few nights ago the film is still very vivid and powerful. Leaving a full aray of haunting images that cant be easily forgotten. The story is about a supposed cursed video tape that if watched results in a phone call in where a young girl tells you that in seven days you will die. We see this happen in the opening part of the film. One of the victims is the niece of Rachel Keller(Naomi Watts) who because of the request of her sister digs deeper into the mystery of four young teens who die in mysterious ways all exactly at the same time. The same four friends who watched the video together exactly one week earlier. Her young son, superbly played by David Dorfman and ex boyfriend (Kiwi Martin Henderson) are drawn into the mystery as well. She soon realises she must solve the origins of the tape quickly as she herself recieved the same phone call straight after viewing the cursed tape. Full of some shocking moments and great horror the film has you gripped from beginning to end with one of the most shocking and freaky endings ive seen in a long time..you will never feel the same about your t.v again! With wonderful cinematography and haunting music (also periods of creepy silence) this is a film you cant easily forget or get out of your head!..leaving many unanswered questions at the end.",10,1,1,4 March 2003
