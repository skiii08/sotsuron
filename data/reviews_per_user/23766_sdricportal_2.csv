Conquest 1453," One sided, absurd. Only worth watching for the visuals.
","While the visuals are definitely nice* and the film features great battles the pure stupidity is unbearable.(*Though for some reason the producer decided to use certain light filters which make everything appear surreal. Either you like it, or you hate it. )About the movie:The sultan starts a war and somehow is the 'good guy' being the aggressor; while he is shown with his family friends and having 'meaningful' visions and a 'holy mission' - his enemies are put into an extremely bad light, even when they're just having dinner the music sounds like a death march.While the 'good guys' somehow kill people by hitting their enemies just once with their forhead - one of the tragic heros survives like 8 deadly arrows in his body just long enough to haul their flag.It's not even a surprise. Everything about this movie is just horribly predictable.I just can't bear this movie. It makes me want to slap my forehead with a pile of wood...Extreme muslims might like this; however everybody with another (or no) believe will just shake his head wondering how on earth this film received its great rating.",3,2,4,17 November 2013
Dunkirk," A movie about loss
","We're living in the Micheal Bay generation. If it doesn't explode it boring. Don't let the negative voices fool you. Dunkirk is a great movie - in it's own way. It's about war. It's not about winning a war, but about surviving it. It's about desperation, loss and shame. This is not a movie to watch for spectacular battles, epic adventures or heroic tales. It's movie that captures the mental horrors of war. You need a certain degree of empathy to enjoy it, it's powerful even though there's barely any blood being spilled.
A lot of people watched it with false expectations and were disappointed. It's not a movie for the masses, even though it might have been promoted as such. If you see it for what it is, it's an incredibly good movie movie.",10,2,4,19 February 2018
