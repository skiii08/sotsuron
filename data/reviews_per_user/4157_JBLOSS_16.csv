The Hangover," Charmless, moronic comedy
","I feel like quite a sucker for having bothered to buy and then watch The Hangover. It follows the aftermath of a stag night in Vegas - four friends get drunk, are slipped some drugs and then forget what they did, losing the groom on the way. It struck me that this is 'Dude, Where's My Groom?' - the characters, all uncharismatic, all unfunny wander around Vegas trying to piece together the night before and find the groom. Think of every clich√© concerning Vegas and you will find it here, the writing was not witty, the jokes as such were not especially funny. There was certainly no drama - I could not care about any of these people, definitely a major disappointment and definitely over-rated. There must be better American comedies out there??? Somewhere???",6,3,6,1 April 2010
Unbreakable," Hugely Disappointing
",This was a major disappointment to watch. In fact a number of people actually got bored and left the cinema when I attended. The film plods along without that much drama until the ridiculous last third. Then the plot 'twist' which is both ludicrous and disappointing is revealed. Frankly I would not watch this again it was pitiful particularly when compared to Sixth Sense.,2,0,1,25 June 2001
As Good as It Gets," I must be missing something ?
",I cannot believe that this film is so highly rated. It drags and drags and is possibly one of the most unfunny comedies I have ever had the misfortune to watch. Sure Jack Nicholson has about 2 decent lines but in all other respects it is awful.People walked out of the cinema I was in during this and I wish I'd done the same. Rubbish!!!,3,4,11,24 October 2001
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," What a disappointment
",I have to say that I thought this film was pretty dreadful - I knew the story from the book but of course realised that the film would not be the same - and boy it wasn't. The most interesting plotlines like the sacrifice of Carlo (which is key to the survival of Captain Corelli is glossed over as to be almost invisible - not by any chance to do with the fact that it was a gay subplot???) are missing. There doesn't seem to be much drama and also very little mandolin - I also have to say that I didn't think anyone's performance was good - the acting just came over as being very hammy. You'd also think from this film that the Italians were a nice bunch of lads basically on an army holiday - all they do is sing and dance. Weren't they a fascist army?? Hadn't they been involved in atrocities previously ? It would have been nice to have a more balanced view - the cynic in me would ask the question whether Hollywood was afraid of offending the Italian-American viewing public. All in all this film fails in practically every department - except the cinematography - Cephalonia looks fantastic.,2,2,4,6 July 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good adaption, great sets but not a great film
",Peter Jackson and his set designers should win oscars for the visual brilliance of this film - it looks wonderful. Jackson should also be congratulated that by and large he has stayed faithful to the book - it is notable that there are some similarities to Bakshi's animated version though - Gollum and the beginning sequences spring to mind. However to claim that this is the greatest movie ever made is ridiculous - the film is shackled by its faithfulness to the original text - this does not allow it to flow and in some cases it drags. If you have not read the books it also does not really explain the significance of some of the places or people. Another casualty of the need to try and set things up for the sequels was that most of the characters have not really been fleshed out - only Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen bring depth here. Probably the greatest failing of the film is that there does not feel any great emotional connection with Frodo or the other Hobbits - you can only show so many close ups of Elijah Woods wide eyed look. Having said that easily the worst thing about this film is the music - it has the subtlety of a sledgehammer and really begins to grate with its attempts to capture the mood. Perhaps the Tolkien family had a point when they stated that they did not believe that LOTR was suited to being shot as a film ???,7,0,0,4 January 2002
Cross of Iron," Best War Film there is
","I still rate this as the best and most honest war film I've seen. It ignores the Hollywood schmaltz that spoiled Saving Private Ryan and manages to portray the soldiers as human beings and particularly for German soldiers this is an exception. The battle scenes are expansive and very bloody as we follow the German platoon trying to get back to its own lines. The soldiers are heroes in an unheroic war and the film captures the chaos, cynicism and heroism of the German retreat. Well worth checking out.",8,108,123,6 July 2001
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Not very engaging and lacks the Potter charm
","Firstly I haven't read the book so came deliberately ignorant to this film. As time went on it felt that JK Rowling had watched a few recent Doctor Who's and come up with this...Tardis suitcase anyone? Lead character unable to engage with people? Anyhow the plot of the movie feels a bit contrived with Newt apparently either looking to return a beast to Arizona or to buy a particular one in NY. We have the wizards and witches more underground and frankly far less charming than those of Hogwarts. They basically seem like a neo-fascist bunch that like to keep themselves to themselves and have a penchant for Gestapo style leather coats. The plot then turns to whether Colin Farells character can locate an Obscura or Obscuris... whichever it doesn't really matter and possibly use them for...well presumably something evil...it's never really explained. There are some good parts with the actors who play Credence and Kowalski being very believable. However, Redmayne is not an engaging or warm actor. There are far too many effects, not enough humour and it really doesn't feel...magical. All in all it passed the time but I won't rush to watch it again.",7,1,3,27 November 2016
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Unexpectedly underwhelming
","I must admit that I had high hopes when I went to see The Hobbit, but with a question of how a relatively short book could be turned into 7 or so hours of film over the 3 instalments. I had fond memories of reading the book and I loved the LOTR films. Unfortunately I think the film really suffers from unnecessary padding and action scenes that just add nothing to the story. The film is a little too knowing with references to the later events of LOTR so it loses some of its innocence. The saddest thing is that the film does look great but it just seems to drag - it's overlong and really doesn't benefit from adding in additional Orc encounters or additional characters. The book in my memory is a little bit more lighthearted and innocent compared to LOTR but this gets battered by too much blood and gore. Martin Freeman does a decent job as Bilbo but he doesn't seem to have a massive range of acting skills - he's the same in The Office or Sherlock Holmes and most of the dwarfs are fairly anonymous. I couldn't call it a disaster but it does not meet the high standards of LOTR and I think the decision to go with 3 films is a massive mistake - out of them might come one decent edited version but on present evidence each instalment is going to be bloated and unsatisfying.",7,4,12,2 January 2013
Saving Private Ryan," Great first 30 minutes
",I am not going to write about historical innaccuracies - this is an American film for Americans ( bit like Forrest Gump in that respect ). I thought the first 30 minutes with the assault on the beach was great and very effective - probably the best piece of action I've seen. However the next piece of the film is very average and verges toward sentimentality - if you want to see what this bit could have been like check out 'Cross of Iron'  - and it just seems to peter out toward the end. I wasn't that bothered about what happened to any of them or whether they saved Ryan or not. I think it would have been better if 'mom's apple pie' had been kept out of the last half and it would have been a more honest film.,7,0,1,16 July 2001
The Incredibles," Wonderful animation, mediocre storyline
",After Pixar's previous efforts The Incredibles may suffer by comparison. Yes the animation is wonderful and detailed but the storylne and script leave a lot to be desired. One big disappointment was that there are very few genuinely funny moments and it felt more like an animated action movie. The storyline concerns itself with individuals being proud of their talents and that everyone should try to become the best at what they excel in. This is wrapped together with what is at best a hackneyed spy or action movie storyline that is not going to win any prizes for originality.This is not a bad film but by Pixar's standards is definitely not a great one.,7,4,9,22 November 2004
Hero," Lovely to look at but lacking in spirit
",This film is worth seeing just for the fight scenes and the wonderful scenery and cinematography. However there was just something missing in this film - I think it was the fact that the characterisation wasn't as developed as it could be or perhaps the film structure could have accentuated the varying views of the past a bit more with a bit more pace. The whole audience of the cinema I was in were obviously restless during the last third of the film as the tension had not built enough and although the film is only just over 1.5 hours it felt like it was a lot longer. All in all something that was pleasing to the eye but I felt it could have been so much better.,Null,0,1,4 October 2004
Moulin Rouge!," A shambles of great sets and terrible cliches
",This film looks great - it is visually superb but I  have to agree with many other viewers - some of the editing takes away from the dance scenes and everything tends to blur into a colourful mess. However sets aside the actual film is pretty weak - the singing is mediocre at best and the storyline is not exactly original. I didn't believe that there was this great love between Kidman and McGregor. Definitely one to see in the cinema but in terms of depth not much there.,7,0,0,10 September 2001
Alice in Wonderland," A sorry mishmash of a film - Burton's worst?
","I am slightly in shock as to how disappointing this film turned out to be - with Tim Burton you expect to see something quirky, unusual, funny and memorable. That this film fails on all levels is a real disappointment. The actress who plays Alice may be a pretty girl but she is totally uncharismatic in this film, her character does not develop throughout the film, she is just as bland as at the beginning. The storyline is completely unengaging and to end with a banal fight scene is a real cop-out. Where was the surrealism?..people saying 'oh we are mad we are' or words to that effect does not really do it justice. Depp's turn as the Mad Hatter is again nothing special and his dancing at the end is a cringingly bad scene, I was embarrassed.... At the end of the film the whole cinema quietly sloped away from a mess of a film that seemed to borrow from LOTR, Narnia, Avatar amongst others and became so formulaic as to be the magnolia of films...really very poor.",5,2,5,11 March 2010
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Great adaptation but ordinary film
",Not having read Harry Potter I thought this was a very ordinary movie. It seems to be a combination of so many other films and books - particularly British children's fiction - that there's nothing outstanding or original about it. Probably the best thing about it is the set and the locations that they found - except Kings Cross station of course! The children are a bit stiff in their acting but it was good to see that it hadn't been made into some awful homogenised Hollywood schmaltz. I am sure it'll earn a billion but only because the books have been so successful.Definitely one for avid fans or those yet to reach puberty.,7,0,0,2 December 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Clunkiest Dialogue Ever!
","What a big disappointment this film was! There is little to distinguish it from the first Matrix in terms of the effects - yes they are good mostly, but at times they looked too much like a computer game. However I cannot quite comprehend how awful the script is - it is simply terrible with the most pretentious and empty dialogue I have heard in a long while. Certainly not bothered about seeing the final piece of this trilogy!Q",5,0,0,27 May 2003
Jojo Rabbit," Satirical yet disingenuous
","There are plenty of things to like about Jojo Rabbit, the performances from the actors are all strong and there are some nice moments of comedy and poignancy. However, my big issue with the film was its portrayal of a Germany that in 1945 was on its knees, had been bombed to destruction and yet the street that the lovely Jojo lives on appears untouched. Even when we see the final battle (why oh why was there a need to show both Russian and American soldiers?) and the ruins, Jojo's street remains unblemished. The hidden Jewish girl, Elsa, would have been hiding for many years, unable to go out yet appears almost glowing. Jojo's mother, Scarlet Johansson, dresses well, has lots of make-up. To me this dilutes the power of the film, the fantasy world of Jojo would have been so much more powerful set against a realistic backdrop.
Jojo's interaction with 'Hitler' is also problematic - he's either the product of Jojo's imagination or he isn't, but the way he behaves in some instances feels like he has a life of his own.
This could have been a classic with all the ingredients it has but ended up being a slightly above average comedy.",6,1,4,14 January 2020
