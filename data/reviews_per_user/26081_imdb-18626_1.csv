Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Awesome critic to all points of view
","The essence of this film is to un-naturalize peoples concepts, already naturalized along our life. How do someone look at us, if that someone isn't inserted in our culture? The differences are just different ways to interpret the reality, trough the culture. This movie explores this concepts. Some people said this movie is racist. IT ISN'T. It only shows a racism that isn't the most common. It can result insulting for American people, but only for those that can see beyond their noses. The film tells the story of a young foreign (Borat). He lives in Kazakhstan, and go to the EE.UU. to learn the marvelous life standards and culture that this country constantly tries to make universal for all people around the world, no matters what they think, or what they need. This parody, is trying to show how can any culture be influenced by 'new models' that seems better, but that only can be applied to an specific region or people. Recommended, if you are looking trough critical eyes.",Null,1,5,24 June 2007
