Ford v Ferrari," Like Fast and Furious, but a real movie
","With an amazing production, great acting overall and a story filled with punches for those that don't know what happened (like me), it gets the job done and creates a very entertaining movie.
But I do think the story is too big or epic for its own good.
It feels not long enough to tell the whole thing, but also too long with boring moments or elements. Pass of time is poorly managed and it bothered me quite a few times.The races are perfect though. Visually stunning. And with together with all the car related stuff, made up for the best part of the movie in the perfect second act.
The acting, awesome. But is Bale, who gets the flashier role, that steals the show.
The movie is also quite funny, although not constantly. But when it makes a joke, it lands.I still think is a bit overrated though, because almost none of the emotional plots landed for me, and at times it felt a bit clichÃ©d.",7,0,2,29 November 2019
The Mask," As funny as the Hulk movies!
","Yes. 8 or 11 years old me liked it (I don't remember loving it, even then). But my God this movie is bad. As a non Jim Carrey fan (he has a couple of actual good movies like Eternal Sunshine and Truman Show; actual comedies like Liar Liar and Dumb and Dumber; and awful disasters at comedy like Ace Ventura and Cable guy and at actual movies like Yes Man and Incredible Burt Wonderstone), I find him appealing when surrounded by a structure and story but not when he's just doing dumb faces and sounds with nothing else to support it.And this is just that. Jim Carrey doing Jim Carrey stupidity for no reason without reason and Cameron Diaz being the definition of pretty.Without any enhancing substance, this movie is nothing more than an annoying mess.It's only a two because it does have some fine set pieces in terms of production values.",2,1,13,6 October 2018
The Avengers," Game changing (at least for about 10 years)
","Even if the movie, the story, wasn't that great, this movie changed cinema (for better or worse), creating a path to serialized 'event' movies, all 'important' to have the whole picture of the insane 23 movies arc of the Avengers. Without this movie being this fun, well paced and put together, we wouldn't have the MCU.And it pretty much delivered on what it promised. Without the need to introduce the main characters, the movie ditched the typical structure and started with a bang to never slow down, really. With action from the start, connecting every single character already presented (the six heroes, their recruiter, the villain). The movie assumed we all knew the characters because we saw the other movies (making them literally a 'must watch' to savior all the details and enhance the experience), which was the best decision ever. They didn't follow the rules (they created their own, which will be become stalled later) and made the best possible ensemble movie.But it wasn't just pure action, because with Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, they started (and would continue in the next movies) their philosophical (lightly philosophical, but still) exploration of war against an exterior threat. And they still managed to give the others moments to shine (if not really arcs of their own). Thor and Hulk with their powers; Black Widow's smart spy mind; Fury's uniting the team, etc.The action is insane and the CGI ridiculously perfect. Loki is perfect for a first villain and the dialogue is funny with the needed exposition done well.Having said all that, the second act could be better and parts a bit too childish or just stupid (Loki vs. Hulk; Hulk 'I'm always angry'; Hulk vs. Thor). But ultra minor things. Amazing movie.",10,2,2,10 April 2019
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Slightly worse than the original... but good
","Even more full of action sequences that scream 'big Hollywood production', this is not as good.
The actors are as efficient in their roles, even with the small changes the story has (Watson is about to get married and with that the duo adventures).
The plot takes us outside Great Britain at some point, and the movie takes a hit visually when we part ways with the Victorian period. Besides, more characters are presented (all 'meh') and the scale of the story gets continental, which makes it a bit forced.But all of this is in service of the villain of this story, the Professor Moriarty, and here is the biggest difference with the original. In the other, the villains were ok. But here, the superb Jared Harris gives his character a malicious presence that matches only his genius level intelligence, making the perfect Sherlock adversary. And yes, the plot gets too big and forced, but also ultra epic, and still perfectly told by Ritchie. Again with an amazing conclusion, it makes every 'boring' second in the other acts count. Also, visually and in dialogue, gets to an incredible level (with insightful but cynic words about the inevitability of War, and the conclusion of the battle of the minds between the two geniuses).The especially bad of this movie was the sexist and criminal role for Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, and the pathetic cast of Stephen Fry as Sherlock's brother, failing miserably in his 'comic relief' role.",7,2,3,18 February 2020
The Incredible Hulk," Bad casting. Thin story. Terrible villain. Limited budget. Terrible movie.
","This was BORING.
The Casting was ATROCIOUS.
The CGI and the action, weak.
The Villain, the worst.
..........The best parts of the movie are the non Hulk parts, with Edward Norton's Bruce Banner. And that still wasn't that great, with mediocre performances from both, Live and Edward and less time than probably needed to flash that.Having said that, Hulk is a really hard character to make interesting.",3,0,2,20 August 2018
Mission: Impossible III," The best of the trilogy
","With a frenetic pace more adequate for this genre without any really attention paid to characters personalities more than 'good or bad', Abrams gives us an incredibly entertaining from start to finish without the clearly weaknesses the first two had.The score is even better than the one from the sequel, the script also much better with its twists and turns and pace.But at the same time, it uses all the same elements than the first two, but better. And that also brings the weaknesses, like the weak characters, the forced emotion that just do not really work, the generic third act and the repetition of things that are a mark of this particular IP (the freaking deus ex machina: mask and voice modulator, even if now explained, have to stop).So yeah, it is much better, but it can't solve the problems of the franchise to elevate it into 'great' territory for my taste.",8,0,0,18 June 2020
Requiem for a Dream," TIMELESS!
","I promised myself that I was never going to rewatch this movie. After years and years of the easiest promise ever, I succumbed to the temptation to see if it still holds up.This movie deals with drugs abuse in the least exciting and glorifying way possible.If this isn't film as art... then I don't really know what is. It works at every level. As a message about drugs, as we see the self destruction of four lives in a slow and excruciating demonstration of addiction. Also as an experimental film with weird editing and cinematography and a great score.Also at acting, because we watch a clear descend into drug madness and all the changes the personalities of the characters go through as they fall.It might be a bit over the top here and there, but it is mostly grounded.One of the best decisions was not to pay too much attention at the 'fun' the guys were getting with their hits. They skip the 'fun part' that 90% of movies about the subject get so enamored to.And with that, Darren Aronofsky created a masterpiece that is a punch in the face to Hollywood usual and glorifying portrayal of drugs... the punch goes also to our stomach.",10,1,1,2 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Absurd Star Wars 'political thriller'
","Because maybe in paper, this could've worked. Trying to give the saga more depth. Trying to show the deficiencies of the Democracy/Republic that lead to the rise of the Empire is not a bad idea per se.But mixing the simple galactic adventure (with clear good and evil) with intricate political nuance was a monumentally hard job for even great writers, let alone someone like George Lucas (more of a creator/producer, considering the actually great movie of the saga was the one he didn't write nor direct).The result was this complete disaster of a movie. Absolutely boring, with the editing trying to force dinamism in totally dull plots, full of scenes filled with exposition and no excitement, and for the most part, action without tension, with no credible threats. The characters either pathetically stiff and unnecessarily solemn (both Jedi, Amidala) or annoying (kid Annakin, Jar Jar). And the plot overly complicated only to go nowhere and comeback to where it all started. It was pretty much a waste of time until the end. Anyways...Bad.",2,0,3,5 September 2018
Sucker Punch," Dark; Violent; Beautiful; Depressing; Realistic; Bittersweet; Metaphorical = Zack Snyder
","The Narrative is interesting, even if it is kind of an excuse to get to the action setpieces, because of the weird structure. I loved that.The overall message of the movie is great, but again, he doesn't glamorizes it like Hollywood. He doesn't give you a candy at the end. He just tell stories.In the end, it's a bit tough to watch; It Deals with heavy REAL stuff (it's not about saving the world from Aliens, we have DC/Marvel/Sony for that repetitive trap), without sacrificing the blockbuster aspect (something that deserves credit for, not the other way around, like some people seems to think); And it tells the story in an interesting way.",6,0,0,30 March 2019
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," A borefest
","Maybe the worst of the franchise. Without too many technically poorly done scenes, but at the same time, with too many scenes where nothings happens.Of the little plot there actually is, its development is tv cable television quality level. Melodramatic and with superficial writing, only relevant and with tension for the ultra fans. The rest of us only see characters worried, annoyed, angry or sad, but without doing anything.When there is tension, is absolutely forced by script conveniences, with sudden needs from characters out of nowhere, and wasting opportunities for real tension (that would've required attentive and smarter writing).To end this, the CGI was atrocious, the worst in the saga, and the score was good for the first time in the franchise. About the acting, is hard to blame the performers, considering what it was giving to them. They tried.",2,0,0,6 June 2020
The Hangover," Low brow humor, but kind of smart?
","This comedy is perfect. It doesn't waste a second, because when it's not making you laugh with a joke, it's presenting a funny situation (that would end in a joke to make you laugh later). But the difference here with other low brow comedies is with the other moments, where besides being funny, the movie allows the characters to be real and let us know each of them, their relationships and how those grow. There is space for realistic reactions and emotions in them, even if the situations and the story are exaggerated.Superb acting from the three leads Helms, Cooper and Galifianakis, stealing the show, making every line as funny as possible.The script and dialogue is pretty great, and the direction from Phillips maintains a good enough balance between realism and ridiculousness really hard to hit. The score (or songs used) could've been better, but that's just a minor thing. Awesome low brow comedy, with enough ingenuity to elevate it above something like a Seth Rogen comedy.",10,1,1,24 December 2019
Iron Man 3," I hate this movie, but it has some things going for it
","I like the action sequences (Although the different suits got misused and the ending could've been even better, showing a greater differentiation between the Armors).
I think Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall did a great job to elevate a terrible story/script.
That's all the good on this movie.The rest of the acting was terrible.
Downey Jr was awful because this movie required more than the one note that he nails like few ever (cocky-funny).
The script was awful; the pace terrible, with an incredible boring middle of the movie to show 'the superhero without the suit', including cheesy acting/dialogue. It looked like an early 90's movie... in 2010's. Also the twist sucked and made a mockery of the little tension the movie could've built.Last point. Like Age of Ultron, they throw a gazillion of terrible jokes and one-liners and they only work when they refer to Tony and Peppers relationship.The movie is so bad, that even making almost Avengers movie type of money, it ended Iron Man's franchise movies.",3,2,4,12 April 2019
Child 44," Starts as Political Thriller. 2nd act as: Horror Thriller. 3rd Act: Hollywood happy ending Action Thriller?
","Yeap. Its THAT WEIRD.But even if that 'makes it bad' by definition, all the scenes and segments and sequences are well done, in my opinion. Some better than others, of course.Maybe I just like Tom Hardy that much, but I though it was a good movie, overall, if you can forgive the fact that it jumps from genre to genre (quite clearly, actually). I can do that, do you?",6,1,1,13 August 2018
It," I totally get if you love it!
","But it just didn't work for me. The story is well told, I think. All the arcs 'made sense' (more or less). And the cast is stellar. So if you loved it (as my cousin did when we watched in the theater), I totally get it.Having said that. There is just too much that is weak.1-Pennywise: One of the few great things about the 90's IT, was that Curry made for a freaking scary clown. An adult, going totally insane and terrifyng kids when he should be the one taking care of them. That's scary. In this case, it looked more like punk bored 20 something trying to prank kids for a youtube chanel. Even if Bill Skarsgård was good, he was just too young.2-Horror scenes: At very best 5 good scares (including jumpscares). The use of horror was super weak. We see the clown too much and too often. The first scenes with him should've been teases, but nope, from the start he goes full on 'scary' and then we get 1h 20m of.... pretty much the same. (On the flipside: the 'human' scary scenes were all perfect. Which makes the lack of them really upsetting).3-Updated kids... until we need the old versions: They let the kids swear and make dark jokes to make them look more realistic. And that was awesome. But then, when they needed to use melodramatic speeches (totally dated, by the way), the kids turned back to the old and dated versions. You either update the kids, or you let them fake enough to make those scenes less jarring and eyes rolling.4-Pennywise's powers and needs: It would probably be explained later. But I just coudn't escape the fact that Pennywise made dumb things that made no sense and it wasn't explained. We don't know ANYTHING. Not even hints. We know he wants them with fear because he says so. But other than that, we don't why he makes the other kids float (Beverly because she wasn't scare enough for him to eat her. But then why the others? All of those kids weren't scare neither? Then, he SUCKS at scaring kids. And by the way, our hero kids were super scared through out the movie. Why he didn't eat them then?). A mess.In the end:-It didn't even have good fun jumpscares.
-The clown looked too young and sounded idiotic not threatening.
-Too much clown opening his spidey mouth for nothing.
-Broken updated versions of kids with super old cliché speeches.
-Pennywise powers all over the place, making it incomprehensible.",5,1,3,23 September 2018
Hereditary," You had a PERFECT psychological horror... and the ending made it a good paranormal flick
","What a waste. The first hour is INSANE. The writing is as good as the Godfather or any drama ever. The acting is sensational (Toni Collette, more than anything).And then... slowly... the movie transforms itself into a more typical possession/ghost/cult/insanity/etc type of horror movie. 
You have to watch this... You don't need to give into the exagerated praise... 
Its good. 
Could've been perfect.(The family dinamics after a death in the family are portrayed as well as possible. There are psychological traits for different characters that are interesting and original, and are all well done. How different members of a family deal with tragedy is excellent. Im pretty sure there is a lot of interesting symbolism, but I have to see it again for that. The point is: All that is presented and then thrown away for a purposely confusing conclusion that is just a cheap way of escaping the responsability of answer the questions the movie presented).",7,0,1,4 September 2018
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," So. What the hell was this?
","I have to say it. I shouldn't have seen this movie, but a best friend of mine loves all the types of action movies. So, I watched it just to share a ''fun'' moment with him one random day.Well, into the movie. I just don't understand. I thought the movie would be self aware from the start. Instead what I watched was a ridiculous mashup of ''serious'' Lincoln scenes, exploring his life (maybe not accurately) but with real scenes. And between those moments we got the ridiculous, but expected given the title, scenes where we find out he's more than a political figure growing and finding love, but a Vampire Hunter. After that we switch back to the ''serious'' scene, and we repeat the cicle.And that's when it lost me. As soon as we got serious scenes, relatively well acted, without jokes (that I was aware off) and without a hint of irony (again, that was my impression), the movie completely lost me. Benjamin Walker was ''too good'' for this movie to work. Im pretty sure that's what the directors wanted out of him, but it was a bad decision. He was an imposing figure with a serious face acting as much as he could the weight of his ''growing love'' and ''passion for his country''. And yet those scenes were followed by him talking to a random exposition guy about the need for killing the vampires. It just didn't work. I was bored with the serious scenes and baffled by the admittedly good action scenes.In the end, I don't hate this movie, It's a kind of ridicoulness that do not works with me, where the ''joke'' is the action/blood and not actual jokes or sarcastic/ironic hits at history. But I guess I can understand why some might like and even love the movie.",1,1,2,27 September 2018
Training Day," A masterpiece action thriller (it's not real life bruh)
","So many people almost offended by the 'that's impossible' scenes from this movie just can't enjoy things.At no point I ever thought 'oh this is like real life but onscreen and the director is denouncing police corruption'.It is very obvious, intended by the director/writer or not, that the movie USES real life problems (corruption at every level, starting for the street drug dealers and ending in the judicial system that benefits from it), and like many other great fun movies puts it all together to create and intoxicatingly fun ride of a movie.The fact that Washington, Scott Glenn and the supporting cast gives the characters that much charisma just makes it better, perfect.Some people are bothered by the ending not being realistic enough and too 'happy' or something like that. I personally love bleak films, but expecting a bleak ending from a pretty dark thriller speaks more on the persons expecting than anything else. The ending was fine and not more impossible than the rest of a movie that doesn't make an attempt to recreate life.",10,0,2,7 August 2019
Detroit," As tense as any horror film
","In fact, a lot of horror film techniques are used (non jump scares) and the tension is impossibly high.
I actually didn't like Zero Dark AT ALL. But here, her style works to make an amazing inmersive film.Having said that:
-It feels a bit longer than neccesary.
-the contrasts between 'bad cops' and 'good cops' is a little too huge.
-She points the finger 'this was/is a problem', but she then shows 'but is/was not everybody'.How is it, then? What you are even doing with this? Moral ambiguity is great, but no moral at all, it's actually immoral in my opinion. If you don't want to accuse a race of something bad then don't touch the subject. If you are not willing to make even the smallest of judgement, why not a documentary then?I don't know. Great technique but It feels like a small waste of time.",6,0,2,20 August 2018
John Wick," Its just not my kind of movie
","This movie makes up a terrible excuse for it to exist (and does it this way on purpose). After that, its just action. No story or character. Lots of bullets and action sequences.Normally I would give this type of movie a 5, but in this case, the very few characters we got and the small amount of dialogue we got was just so bad that I had to take a points away. Willem Defoe was atrocious. That's really hard to do!This movie is just bad, even if the action is good (and sometimes great)",4,1,3,20 August 2018
Wind River," Good movie. Good ending. Good performances. Bad taste?
","The story is ok, good. The scenes are often cliché, but some have interesting monologues about suffering and moving on from tragedies, etc. We get a crime and the difficulties to persecute it (geographic, weather, politics, resources, social dynamics) and a more or less slow but really well done process to unravel the truth. The acting is solid at least, with some great moments.What's the bad taste? After the movie ends, we see that a point of the movie is tell the story of the injustice that native American women suffer (and the fact that nobody is paying attention to it).
Why then the story is told by two white leads?
I get the FBI agent, totally, but why Renner then? The story is about Native Americans (and particularly women) suffering, but we experience it by Renner and Olsen, two whites, totally empathic towards these crimes. So, we kind of don't see much of that apathy towards the problem the movie is supposedly denouncing (there are a couple of lines about how the FBI won't care, but it's never clear that is more than typical bureaucracy and not something against the Native American). Also, we get the birth of a friendship/romance between them that gets in the way (more than anything because it is portrayed in the most cliché ways), and makes it lose the focus.
In the end, I still left the movie interested in the problem and subject, so the movie succeeds, even if I question some of the moves and decisions taken.",6,0,3,23 July 2019

I'm indifferent to Teri Polo and Blythe Danner. I love De Niro, yeah, but in a comedy?And yet, everybody just works on this one. I absolutely adore every second of this movie for some reason (James Rebhorn is particularly amazing). I think the script and dialogue is so good that allows everybody to put on great performances. That's all I got. I don't really know why, but I love this movie and I saw it multiple times and it never gets even a bit worse.",10,1,1,23 April 2019
Mulan," Finally!
","This movie is a feminist Disney movie, and for once, they actually don't screw everything up! It's as subtle as a Disney movie could possibly be. It is short and direct and great.But beyond the story, which might be the best Disney story ever (non-Pixar), it has some real flaws in my opinion.1st and worst-English? Seriously? Americans....Americans... Great story, but hearing CHINESE CHARACTERS IN CHINA SPEAKING ENGLISH? C'mon. Disney should remake the audio and incorporate the Chinese option.
2-Music: What the hell? The songs just don't rime, ever! It's insane. Or maybe I just didn't listen well.
3-Animation: Kind of great for moments, but overall not that pretty. The faces are fine, but the desings are not super pretty to be honest.
4-Jokes (some): Even if absolutely great (really, I often laugh very little with Disney jokes, and this character made me laugh and chuckle), the Eddie Murphy character broke the 'Chinese culture' feeling of the movie. It made it funnier, but a bit dumber too.",8,0,1,3 February 2019
Unbreakable," Realistic (or Boring?)
","I have two viewings experiences of this movie.One is the literal superhero origin movie. As that, I have to say, I was bored. I'm all for realistic and gritty movies. I LOVE THAT. But Bruce Willis just bores me. His insistence on denying the use of his abilities was understandable, yet repetetive and boring. The final twist makes it better and overall it would be normal a mediocre, even if interesting, movie.But the other viewing experience is the interpretation I gave to what I was watching, while I was a bit bored with it.
It is quite similar to the story from 'The Incredibles'. Bruce Willis' character left his desires, his dreams, for love. And he has regretted it since.
He choosed 'family' over the individual (himself). He choosed family over his own goals and was dissatisfied with his life years later, which made him and his family unhappy and at the brink of self destruction (well, divorce, I mean). I can go on, but that's basically the metaphor. A man unhappy by the fact that he let what made him a man (the use of his god given abilities) apart, to have a more complacent life that looked great when younger, getting stomped by his wife (the symbolic reason to suppress his abilities, emasculation), his boss in a terrible job (wasting his potential), and his son (that thinks he's a coward for not wanting to accept and use his powers). I could go on... But it has similarities with The Incredibles.That's my interpretation of the movie and in that character study interpretion, I think it is really good although still a bit boring (slightly less important giving the substance).",7,2,4,18 September 2018

Dawn of the Dead," The best 'zombie' movie ever
","The best intro possible for the zombie apocalypse concept. The thrilling set piece is a masterpiece of direction. Yes, haters, it just is.After that, the movie turns into an unstoppable fun ride and survival adventure.The acting is ultra strong and the script lets all of the characters to have highs and lows, and all of them are endearing in their own ways. Most of them have small arcs that are resolved in compelling and beautiful ways.Besides that, the action, the production, the cinematography, is all top notch (and the DVD extras are incredible too).In the end, it doesn't 'transcends the genre'.

Lol. That's a freaking lot and I didn't include Tony's father and alcohol issues. Oh, and War Machine's origin).So yeah. I get it. To some, it's too much. But I absolutely love almost every single scene from this movie. I don't care. I just love every story beat, even if it's not artistically well developed.Sadly, again, ''Iron Man'' doesn't know how to end a movie. We got some dumb villains doing dumb things for some reason, and there is no tension really, and it gets too big in concept but the budget just doesn't allow for it to translate well enough onscreen, and it kind of sucks.

Us," Superb 2nd Act and great Ideas.
","But it was a bit Boring.
Overlong first act, quite pointless? I should rewatch it.After that, the horror starts and its great, and there is also comedy, and Its great too.But then the movie starts to show its cards. There aren't any clear rules, so the movie asks you to come up with explanations for things. Characters do stuff that make no sense unless you start thinking of possible reasons for them. If you can forget about those things, then it would be perfect.The ending, explaining (literally, a character explains everything) is boring and annoying because of the artistic decisions made, and also contradictory and nonsensical (at least at first glance).The themes are there, the ideas are there, the talent is there, but the plot asks too much suspension of disbelief and I don't like over the top endings for 'smart movies' (Hereditary did the same thing). It's wanting to have the cake and eat it too.----------Waiting for a rewatch to change my mind and the score-----",Null,1,3,29 March 2019
Knives Out," Excellent writing still wasted tons of potential
","The movie starts really high. The presentation of characters is superb. Entertaining (and needed) exposition mixed with funny dialogue and great performances, ultra natural. But after 15 great minutes, the real protagonist Marta (Ana de Armas) takes center stage. The movie promised by the trailer ('Clue' but in a movie, and funnier), just wasn't anymore. She was the victim's nurse. The victim was the patriarch of a family, owner of millions and murdered the night of his 85 birthday. The supporting character is detective Blanc (Daniel Craig), motivated by a curious anonymous contract to investigate the crime.From there, the focus is on Marta and her connection with the family and the crime, and the detective trying to unveil the truth, leaving the rest of the cast in the periphery. The film's pace suffers. Even with great writing, the story just gets more conventional. Chris Evan's character, Ramson, gets a bigger part after an hour, but by that time, the movie just had lost the intensity. It ends up being dense. A mix of repetitive 'investigation scenes', good jokes, bad jokes, little twists and bigger twists, and it turns awkward.With a lack of emotional weight and skin deep social commentary, the solved mystery doesn't satisfy.The idealization of the minorities (in this case, Latin-American), creating a character almost impossibly virtuous without any defect, felt clearly condescending.",5,8,15,19 December 2019
Spider-Man 2," Great when not trying to be 1978 Superman... again!
","I thought I would like this one more, considering how many people have this one as a favorite (or top) comic-book movie.
I'm not there. It is one of the best as showing the tool that it takes the responsibility of being a super-hero. That was the only really great thing about this movie. Few had shown this because it is hard. Expert job on it.This movie is great also when Raimi uses techniques more related to horror, on sequences that work perfectly. The action is pretty fun, and the train sequence is still one of the comic-book bests, probably.
There is catch on the horror thing. There are a gazillion woman yelling like a scream queen would, everytime something dangerous may happen to them. It's ridiculous.But the weaknesses of the first movie remained on this one. The villain is better, yes, but his actions are still impacted by the 1978 Superman. He does stuff that makes no sense, and how the city reacts to him is not only unrealistic but quite dumb. Fine for 1978, but in 2004? Nope.
The dialogue is even WORSE. It is really dreadful.
Also, the acting got worse. Tobey MaGuire nails the self-doubt but nothing else. Kirsten is quite bland and with her screen time, she would've been better if having more peaks and valleys on her performance, giving that she changes her mind quite a bit on few scenes. James Franco is as bad as ever.It's good. With great and weak things almost in equal parts.",6,2,4,22 March 2019
The Irishman," Slow, and with the energy of a 75 years old grandpa
","That doesn't mean that every scene in this monstrous and self indulgent 3 and ½ hours movie is boring, but overall, that's how I felt.
The de-aging is distracting. Some De Niro scenes works really well, but for the most part it's just too noticeable. Plus, the younger faces didn't match the tone and energy of their voices and bodies.
So, with that in mind, the performances are ruined with their 'younger versions'. It's a lie. De Niro and Pesci can't act like 20+ years younger.
But. Al Pacino to the rescue! He shines as the only one still capable of talking fast and/or yelling! I'm not saying he created an accurate portrayal of Hoffa. But his energy saved the movie for me and the hour and a half focused on him was the stellar one.The story, another gangster movie, is more 'intimate' or 'sentimental' than the older ones, and it gets more interesting than Casino and Godfellas (bigger political implications, relatively explored in the movie).
In the last 40 minutes Scorsese tries to be Charlie Kaufman (Synecdoche, Adapation) or something. It goes really bad.
With younger people playing the younger versions of the characters? Maybe I can forgive the fact that is too long with better energy from younger actors. With a shorter cut? Maybe I could forget about these old actors failling to act 35+ years younger with the distracting CGI.
But like this, I just can't give this movie more than a five.",5,9,19,30 November 2019
Finding Nemo," For Gods Sake!
","Ellen DeGeneres/Dory: What to say about this? Apparently, if youre famous you can't do anything wrong? She's beyond annoying, but she's never funny. Her voice is disgusting to listen too, so if the intent was to capture how annoying that type of character with a memory problem could be, that was a good job, but totally unnecessary and harmed the movie. That character didn't need a recognizable voice but a sweet one. The situation was annoying (and could've been funny) without an annoying voice.Barry Humphries/Shark Bruce: And then this. My GOD. How can you screw up a shark? The thing of not wanting to eat fish was clever (playing with Sharks sense of smell). But again, the voice was obnoxious (when he was on eating mode) and dumb (otherwise) rather than terrifying and dumb, which is the way it should've been.You had WILLEM DAFOE and GEOFFREY RUSH BUT YOU GAVE THIS PART TO BARRY WHO? ARE YOU STUPID?This movie has an 8. That's disgusting and shows you that you can throw dirt to people's faces, but with the name Pixar/Disney they would love it.",1,1,6,24 August 2018
Blade," Very cool and visually appealing movie. It's just not good.
","It remind me of Venom, which is terrible for 2018 Venom. The way it works it is dated with very little and uninteristing plot, with terrible villains and little character development for our hero (closer to the 80's in that sense).But it is visually really cool (taking in consideration that the special effects are dated) and the cinematography just works overall.
Maybe it was the need for more humor (or better humor) and definitely the need for better exposition scenes, a better plot and better villains and worldbuilding. Well, actually all of those things forced me into a low rating, even if I did enjoy the movie alot, right until the last third.
Still, not awful, just maybe dated and too 80's and 90's, when ridiculous unrealistic human behaviour was totally fine, taking away any sense of realism or plausibility and lessening the enjoyment, at least for me.",4,1,4,3 September 2019
The Mummy," Ok action, but terrible movie. Tiresome even if never totally boring. Mediocre.
","The Story: Not important. Everything is an excuse to move the plot forward to show the next action sequence.Characters: Impossibly shallow. There are no arcs for the characters. None of them grow in any significant way after the story.Acting: Lol. Rachel Weisz was still just a gorgeous woman, but absolutely awful at acting. The rest of the cast weren't and aren't and won't be any good, so yeah. The acting is the worst.Action: Pretty entertaining and the only thing that keeps the ship afloat. Probably less well shot than the Spielberg's Indiana Jones, and copying a bunch from it, is still engaging enough. But also overstays its welcome and ends up being a bit annoying after one hour and a half of the movie.In the end, if had not been almost two hours long, maybe. But there are 20/30 unwelcomed minutes here on a thin plot, zero interesting stuff, plus clichés to move the thing forward. It's bad.",4,1,12,23 March 2019

","I like the pretentious premise. The 'fight against the educational system that suppress individuality, passion and expression and critical thinking in search of pragmatism and efficiency valuing life in dollars/'success' and nothing more'. I like that. Alos, Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke are excellent in the roles of confused young adults/teens. All their scenes are great. But...Insert: Robin Williams. And I just can't. I don't believe a thing about his character. I don't believe he's smart, nor that he's inspiring. His weird methods only made me think he was dumb and weird, more than different and better. Maybe with a better dramatic actor in his place, I would consider good this exact same movie.Besides that, neither the score, nor the dialogue (except for a couple), nor the emotional conclusion of the story were specially great to counter the downside of having Robin Williams.",5,0,4,13 February 2020
Insomnia," Finally watched it from my favorite director. Good is the floor, apparently!
","This was more of a (really) slow burn.
The story is nothing really special, about 'good cops vs. the right way vs. the judicial system vs. the bad cops vs. the bad guys'. Done before and after. It's fine. It's good.Problem is, the clichés that built the story the first 40 minutes are a bit boring to watch.After that, the tension goes up and never goes down. Pacino was really good, in kind of an easy role for him, but contrary to many, I dislike very much Robin Williams in general and he again just doesn't work here. (Awakenings may be the only time I thought it was good on a role).Here, Robin Williams destroys everything with his acting, tone, presence and face. Except for one scene, he fails Pacino and the movie. Put Patrick Wilson (or many others) on the role? This is suddenly much, much better. Swank wasn't that good either. Allison Tolman from Fargo Season 1 would've nailed the part! (with time traveling, I know).In the end, the worst Nolan movie, it is still good.",6,0,0,23 March 2019

","This is probably the best action and the most visually gorgeous super hero movie ever made (or my favorite at least). Maybe Infinity War can compete. Probably. But that's it. James Wan is an artist, at least visually.There are problems, of course:
The humor is hit and miss.
The way the story is told is a bit too repetitive.
Some songs are jaw droppingly bad.
The villains too basic.But the good is great:
The emotion works (barely, but it works).
The arcs of the characters feel totally earned.
Parts of the score are actually pretty awesome.
The villains while basic, help to force our protagonist to become the hero and define him.
Did I mention that the action is insanely good?I often don't care that much about the action.... but there are exceptions and this movie just blew me away without being complemented by an awful story (like Valerian, for example)",8,10,22,14 December 2018

Of course they believe is good, It worked for them!But I got nothing out of this movie. The action was barely serviceable. And almost every scene filmed like a really bad sitcom, with awful 'What we do in the shadows' type of improvised jokes.
They destroyed Thor (Star Lord/Chris Pratt rip off). They buried Loki. And they literally burn Asgard to ashes.
Bad movie with those few laughs and Cate Blanchett's charm and beauty salvaging another terrible Marvel villain.PD: And then, the actually 'good at their job' Russo brothers saved Thor with IW, and with only a few minutes, they honored and used Loki way better than Dumbtiti on an entire movie.",3,5,10,12 April 2019
Resident Evil: Extinction," Not an adaptation anymore. It got out of hand
","They went GLOGBAL with this one, and while we see that, more or less, with some shots of a dessert Earth, this took away the intimacy of the at least a bit 'plausible' story contained in Raccon City in the first two entries.The first 30 minutes are boring and probably filler to get to 1 h 30 m runtime.
I remember fun characters and tension from the jump on the first two, and yet, on this one, there is only exposition (Umbrella), a bit of nothing with a bit of action (Alice) and the presentation of a bunch of new characters that can barely register on your mind.Once it picks up, it's fine, but the Alice's new powers kind of ruin a bit of the fun and tension and the Umbrella scenes were awful. Just a bit.A mediocre entry, with some particular problems (it got too big, the Umbrella scenes were quite awful, the new powers are questionable, filler scenes)",3,0,5,29 March 2019
Zodiac," Probably 'too realistic' for its own good
","The characters are all 'too mundane'. Even the obsessed character (often overacted) is quite bland (not Jake Gyllenhaal's fault, because he's awesome), let alone the incredible amount of police officers and detectives that we came across through the movie.All the performers look bored except Mark Ruffalo (clearly the heart and soul of the film). And even he gets axed for the conclusion in the third act (almost all Jake). I don't understand why Robert Downey Jr. was cast for this. He was pathetic. I didn't believe for a second he was a journalist. Not even a bad one. And he barely matters anyway.In the end, the movie is sterile. Almost like a mediocre documentary that can't create a narrative, this movie jumps so much trough time without giving the characters screentime to reflect and suffer the consequences of an unresolved case, that (probably intentionally) doesn't allow the viewer to feel anything for anybody. The movie wants you to focus on the minutia of the police work and that gets old.",6,3,5,19 September 2019
The Terminator," Organic and well made action movie
","I feel the best thing they did with this one is Linda Hamilton's character, Sarah Connor. They really take their time into making her slowly accept and learns from the crazy situation she finds herself in. Linda is absolutely perfect in the role, and we see a transformation from a normal girl that wanted to have dates to a survivor. Also, the relationship with her protector from the future is also well done. She makes it work, because Michael Biehn absolutely sucks.In that sense, the movie lacks acting quality besides Linda Hamilton (which wasn't amazing, but great for the role). Even Arnold doesn't quite nail the 'machine from the future', in my opinion.The dialogue is awful. Most of the time is terrible exposition, but is also bad when helps the characterization of our leads.But that doesn't matter that much, because it is a pure action/sci-fi movie. The ending ties it all up, and even if the action gets a bit repetitive for me, it still good.",6,1,5,7 November 2019

","With a terrible source material, Spielberg decided to create his Avatar movie. The story is as bad. There are as many clichÃ©s. This movie won't ever surprise you (that might be a staple of the director?).Spielberg knows what to do to create a couple of heroes and villains, and he does just that. The movie is, in reality, an avalanche of references of pop culture with the shape of an action flick and some sparkles of Spielberg sentimentalism (gag inducing, but with professionally placed scenes by Spielberg).The only reason to especially like this movie is the references. I don't care about them (and probably I didn't catch half of them), so.",3,0,2,11 August 2018
Molly's Game," Elevated by Jessica Chastain
","The movie takes too much time to really 'get into it'. The first hour (and probably a bit more) gets a bit boring or tedious, with way too many minutes needed to present Molly and her circumstances to us (childhood, education, etc.), key to comprehend the movie at an emotional level. To understand her motivations. It works, in the end, but that doesn't change the fact that it gets tedious in the first half. The use of voice over doesn't help (does it ever?). Without Jessica Chastain, the character would've been even harder to like, enjoy or appreciate, giving that it has few redeemable traits and a bunch more of bad ones. Because she's the only main character, it's a problem.The story is good but I didn't feel it was as epic as the movie tried convince us it was. This is not really about the intricacies of the corrupt police, political and judicial system allowing the mobs to control and fight over the criminal underworld. It wasn't about foundations and corporations working as money laundering facades nor it was about the fraudulent world of finances ('The Big Short'). Because the story focuses on her, something that could've been epic, gets smaller. The movie tells us is big, but we don't see big.About the performances, Idris Elba is also really good as Molly's moral lawyer, and Kevin Costner makes everything of the few minutes of screentime, helping the movie to land Molly's emotional arc. The score is kind of forgettable. The editing questionable (like I said, some scenes felt boring but in theory they shouldn't have been).The movie is fine, and it's not a waste of time nor it is knowing about this story, but I just can't forget the boring first half and the not so great execution of the second part.",5,2,5,6 February 2020

","With a story and a structure ultra cliche, based in the adventure of 'the chosen one' influenced by 'destiny' or a mentor or both, trying to solve a crisis, save his/her family or the world even, the movie is only acceptable because of how impressive is visually. The colors, animation and overall designs are all incredible. Some details coming from the Maui culture are great too, or at least interesting and different.But the jokes don't work ever, of the six songs, only two are great (the ones representing the protagonists) and the other are awful.

Its something I didn't know that happened, and it is interesting. Without the made up parts, the movie could've been 20/30 minutes shorter, and better, with better pace between the tense scenes of Adam Driver having to prove he wasn't a cop, and Ron's policial work and discussions by phone with Duke. Or you could've shown how the 'non nazis whites' are also part of the problem, instead of just telling us that.",5,5,8,27 March 2019

","This was a good movie.It is funny, for the most part. The movie doesn't try to be more than good, and focus on the characters, with plenty of little scenes that make you laugh and don't need too much exposition to serve a grand story.Because of its simplicity and small scale, we get to see how funny the Spiderman Universe can be under Marvel.There are problems (the bully casting is INSANE. There wasn't enough in the movie to justify why Tom Holland would take the punches without reacting. You are forcing it here! Maybe show how incredibly rich he is, and how he basically buys an entourage, and THAT'S why Tom can't do more than resist).Anyways. Keaton is having fun and that helps too.

The movie uses 'voice-over' for no reason, because It doesn't add anything.
All the scenes that Travis (the protagonist) isn't in, are weak and do not add anything (there aren't too many, to be fair)
Betsy (the blond woman he stalks) accepts to date him for no reason. It is literally ridiculous.

It's compared with James Bond and Mission Impossible, two franchises I never cared about, and makes me want to watch them.I wouldn't say it's perfect because they shouldn't have made Hydra that important of a part. They should've owned the fact that America is as dangerous as other countries for them to have that developed weapon. Not just because 'we might get infiltrated by bad people, but we are good', but because America it is dangerous, period.That fact muddles the message that Captain America learns (don't follow institutions, even Americans ones) and puts the blame exclusively 'on the dangerous others', but still, Steve Rogers' arc keeps developing in coherent ways (something can't be said for all the others).",9,0,2,12 April 2019
Doctor Strange," Potentially better, bogged down by Marvel cookie cutter machine.
","Visually, this might be the best MCU movie (not Avengers). Also, Stephen Strange is not like Tony Stark, like a lot of people and critics said it was. It has similarities (super ego, millionaire, best at his job, ultra smart), but the personalities are clearly different. Also, Benedict Cumberbatch seems to enjoy the dumb comic-book world. The story is another Marvel Origin superhero and 'it works', barely.Now the bad. The jokes do not work, for the most part. The villain is underused and weak. The story already done with Thor (humility and being worthy) in the same MCU, which makes it even less original because it has a similar tone and feel. The powers aren't well explained at all. There are some major dumb things, like the prohibited books section and whatnot.Having said that, the action is fun and different because of the kind of powers Strange has. Also the discussion of the 'Chosen One' and 'breaking the laws of nature' and the moral conundrum of using power 'from the Dark Dimension' and the extent of its use to protect the Earth, etc, is pretty interesting (although again, cut by the Marvel light-hearted formula, it's not the most profound discussion of such things with a conclusion that says: its good when the hero does it).

Its good.The acting is pretty great overall.Now the bad:
-There is a particularly female character that is treated like an idiot for no apparent reason other than make some laugh at her. It seems malicious more than social commentary on that type of personality. Because she isn't a person, really, the way she's writen.
-The Friends of our 'hero?' are DIVERSE. Its too on the nose, and really not particularly interesting giving that they aren't allowed to even be characters (they do little to nothing).

It continues the boring and weak political plot, and develops into an even more boring and bland 'spy movie' lead by the 'cautious' (read: boring) Jedi Obi with a lot of ultra boring Jedi's meetings in between.The disaster is big enough when you can clearly see the intention to put in as much action or chase sequences as possible, most of the overlong and pointless, as a way to distract (or wake up) people between the exposition scenes.

A move Hollywood wouldn't make, and it would've made sense with the characters and situation. It would've made this movie more 'artistic', raising questions about humanity and whatnots.And they said: NOPE, WE'RE NOT DOING THAT.So what there is left is what we see.

The past and origin of the story the trilogy was going to tell, including the races, plus developing our 4 protagonists (Frodo and Sam, Gandalf and Aragorn), show the villains, and leave space for the secondary characters.
This can get tiresome, and for me, it felt boring in the more contemplatives parts, when the elfs where predominant. In a three our epic, having 20+ boring minutes is a flaw, but not a huge deal.The dialogue and psychology of the characters is simplistic (a bit childish), like the overall story (good vs. evil), but that's a happy trade off for this epic and immersive world building. Both characters and dialogue improve in the sequels.With so much time filled with exposition and action/adventure or world building, the director abuses a little of a combination of: slow motion, score and voice eco, to make us feel for our characters. It's not a big deal, but it gets repetetive and quite pointless.The production. Acting. Cinematography. Special effects (for the time). The epic and thrilling adventure. Everything is so perfect that even the people not inclined to like fantasy stories would feel impossible not to finish the story after this one (like myself, when I watched it for the first time). And it only gets better after this one.",7,0,3,31 December 2019
Man of Steel," A true Super Man
","The 1978 is terrible, just acceptable for people from that era.
It presents an awful Superman that is good and does good 'because'. No character development, no psychological weight. A skin deep character that when really analized, it's not what the movie say it is.
He's selfish and vacant. He uses his power to get a girl or without thinking in the awful consequences that they could produce, all for personal reasons (time travel). The rest of the characters aren't better. Lex Luthor's plan is embarrasing and Louis Lane is insultingly superfitial, falling in love, basically, of power. She doesn't know Superman as a man, but she does love his powers. Great. Great character!Anyways. That was 1978. We are better now. And now we have a real human (that's how he grew up after all). Clark is filled with contradictions, complicated feelings and full of fears and weaknesses. He's phisically perfect, but mentally, he's just another boy and man. We see how he becomes Superman, slowly learning from his families (both), and finally making decisions by his own, not for himself, but for the well being of others, even sacrifizing things himself. But not by solving everything with his powers and that's it. No. It's never that easy. There is colateral damage and he has to deal with it and improve. I can love this Superman. Now you can really believe that a man can fly.",10,16,23,9 April 2020
Little Miss Sunshine," They don't all die in the end...That was the only ending that would made me like this crap

That wasn't the ending. Then, I totally HATED this trash",1,0,7,13 August 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Too kid friendly, but good!
","The movie is visually spectacular (with the exceptions of a handful of blurry scenes filled with blues and reds, maybe for 3D purposes?). The colours and character designs are gorgeous. The dynamics of the action and the camera work is superb. All of this is 'all time great' level.But... The story is ultra basic, therefore quite boring for about 45 impossibly predictable minutes. The jokes, while clever for a movie for kids, just didn't make me laugh. Not even one time. I'm not sure why. Also, the story lacks all kinds of depths. It's literally no sense, but I don't think is the focus of the movie, because...What really works is the theme of the film. Everybody can 'wear the mask'. And they proved it by showing it, not depending on melodramatic and cliched monologues, but with the story itself, that included different versions of totally different people 'wearing the masks'.The emotional bits also work well and kind of justify the boring preparation for it, developing Miles Morales origin story and his family and problems really well. Simple, but well done.
For last, the villains and its plans are just almost pointless and beyond under developed. There was probably no enough time to give them better and more coherent plans.
A good movie, visually superior with a well done and coherent message that actually works in the story (sometimes these superhero movies contradict themselves and they are about the 'problem with violence'... by using violence to solve the problem. No here. Spiderman is not white, black, female, old or young. It can be anybody. And they are good).",7,30,50,25 February 2019
American Beauty," Why I waited so long to watch this?
","Just an amazing movie with masterful pace, stories that connect each other and the conclusion is super satisfying. 
But not in a 'everybody lived happy forever after' nor in a 'and everything ended with suffering and pain'. It was a perfect and realistic (for the characters presented in the movie) ending without being unnaturally happy or sad.I loved all the characters (even if not twhat they were doing), which is a huge rarity, and if I don't give this movie a ten, its because even if I loved them, the characters are actually more like archetypes, prepared to make a social commentary in every single one of them and their psychology, which feels a little too structured at certain points (like: one character just does exactly what the archetype would do, instead of a more nuanced reaction, thus helping the movie move forward and making the point).Anyways. Amazing movie.",9,0,0,13 September 2018
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the best Action Movies ever (if not 'the' best)
","Right from the first second, Arnold seems way more comfortable as a robot. Robin Patrick T-1000 is amazing from the start too. The score (including the amazing Guns and Roses song) helped to make the movie more fun, which aligned with Arnold's role as the good guy this time. Furlong was perfect for the typical 90's movies teenager rebel. And Linda Hamilton somehow was even better in this movie, being an amazing 'crazy' badass. A set piece in the hospital is perfect.Again, everything in the story is kind of tied up well (about time travel and the future, etc.).The exposition and dialogue improved a bit (including a theme about machines as better than the fallible humans), but enough is still the weak part of the sequel. The detail or aspect that doesn't allowed it to be a perfect movie. Still, I think is a masterpiece in the action genre.",9,1,1,7 November 2019
Disturbia," Definitely good, the actors make it even better
","A very well done movie full of clichés but all in the right doses. The awkward but interesting teenager (Shia), the beautiful 'out of his league but sympathetic and also interesting' girl Sarah Roemer and the funny comic relief but real friend Aaron Yoo make up the trio of 'investigators' that try to find out if a neighbor is or not a murderer (the great and intimidating David Morse).The more difficult scenes in this type of PG-13 Thriller are the ones with tension, and they are all expertly done here by the director (and probably the editor). The rest of the lighter elements are all so nice. Fast paced, a blend of comedy, tension and suspense with enough twists to complement the good cast.",8,1,3,9 January 2020
Edward Scissorhands," Stop. Just stop.
","Let's just think for a second.What if Ed Scissorhands looks less like Jhonny Depp and more like James Galdonfini. Are you sure you would like it as much?What if instead of leather he wears some blue jeans and a mundane white t-shirt. The character is the same, but now looks like a normal worker. You think you would like the movie the same?OF COURSE NOT! This movie is 100% dependant on you loving this weirdo. Anything and everything else is ridiculous and quite dumb.Or maybe i'm just not the target for this movie for girls and women that love the pornographic 'cuteness' and well, Jhonny Depp.",1,5,12,23 August 2018
Silver Linings Playbook," What the heck was that?
","It was this a comedy? Because I didn't laugh once (maybe once on a rude comment here and there).
Was this a realistic movie about mental problems? Of course not. 
Was this an original mix of genres with great writing? No. It has cliché romance, cliché father/son problems. Cliché violent guy problems. All together with a cliché ending. The only 'different' thing is the performances of mentally unstable people by the gorgeous leads... That's it.It is terrible and overrated",2,0,4,5 August 2018
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Another beast from Fincher
","It's David Fincher. So, the movie is dark, bleak (visually and tone). But it really works in every way here, because of the story. Mikael (Daniel Craig), an investigative reporter denounced for.. basically 'fake news', is hired by a the head of one of the biggest companies of Sweden to investigate an old unresolved crime, which could involve people from within the big family that owns it. The other plot is about Salander (Rooney Mara), a private investigator with psychological problems. Eventually, both would join forces to figure it all out.The acting is really good and convincing (if you don't care that they speak in english. It's a problem...). Rooney Mara makes believable a, sometimes, over the top character. The movie fells like a more realistic and emotional 'Seven'. The editing is superb, without a boring second, even when we have tons of exposition (to make us understand the places, characters and facts of the story). The score is great and the production superb.In some ways, this is like 'Zodiac', but without the 'based on real life' restrictions, the exploration of the characters, victims and victimizers and all in between, felt complete and better. Maybe it's just me, but I think it explores the power dynamics in society that we accept which allows people to suffer alone and lets others to impart suffering 'in front of our eyes'. Anyways, between the great story and the great Fincher, we got a little masterpiece.",10,0,1,23 January 2020
Spider-Man," Great when not just remaking 1978 Superman!
","So.
The first act looks and feels like a normal late 90's movie from the time. There is nothing special. It's ok. The score isn't good. The acting goes from good to bad at random, and the dialogue is kind of weak.
Then we get the core of the movie (Uncle Ben scene) and that's perfect. Few comic-book movies justifiy so perfectly the guilt and heroic responsability for the main character. It's awesome.
After he gets to be Spiderman, the movie improves a lot and is motly pretty good with some exceptions. MJ 'love' relationship with Spiderman is weak and unjustified. Why are Peter and Harry friends? Why is MJ Harry's girlfriend? The movie asks you to believe they all love each other, but we don't see it onscreen in my opinion.
Willem Dafoe's Goblin is... ok. Him trying to get to team up with Spiderman isn't though. Why would Spiderman join him? He's on a personal vendetta, even if Spiderman is a criminal, there is no reason for him to join in.
Whatever. The movie is fine, and the action sequences pretty great. The movie is funny, just not that great.Good movie overall, with great action, a great hero origin story, but weak and stilted dialogue, ok at best villain, and not always great acting. I liked it more at the time, but it may have been because Kirsten Dunst was, understandably, a super crush for me.",6,0,0,22 March 2019
The Fast and the Furious," It was good for a while, but it ended up mediocre.
","I'm watching the whole series (I only saw 1 and 2), so this is the first one. I liked it for what it was when I was 15 or something, but even then I knew it wasn't good.Besides the awful acting and mediocre at best dialogue, I have to say It was good (just that, good) for a while, which was surprising. All the set-up was fun, even if dumb of course, and the 2nd act was good, creating tension for Paul Walker's character.And then... they dropped the ball. They made a scene that could've cut a lot of boring minutes of this movie, and justify the ending at the same time.And yet, they keep going, wasting all the tension just to have a stupid last motivation for the characters to be where the writers wanted them to be. Again, they didn't need the dumb Hollywood 3rd act because by the end of the second they had the characters in good position to finish the movie. But they wanted more chases, and races, and cars blowing up, and they made a bit of a boring flatter ending.It's 'ok fun', 5 points.",5,1,4,24 March 2019
Now You See Me," Lol. People don't understand anything nowadays!
","I liked it in the theater, and I liked it today, when I watched it again.
It had a lesser impact because I knew the twist and turns, but the magic tricks were still awesome, the escalation of the whole con and revenge well done and the movie has no malice, no unnecessary deaths to give it 'meaning', nor any casualties. You have to see this movie. It worths the time.Having said that, It is true though, that the dialogue and parts of the story seemed forced at points. Also, some actors do some amazing work while others are, at least in my opinion, quite awful.Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Freeman and Caine are amazing. Melanie Laurent and Ruffalo do their best effort to sell some too forced story beats, and Ruffalo in particular struggles to give his character any charm or believability, stuck in the middle. Isla Fisher and Dave Franco were a cringe fest.SPOILERS! SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSA LOT of people saying that Mark Ruffalo's character being in the FBI, just to have revenge about his dead father (another magician) is too much work not to be ridiculous.IT WAS 'THE EYE'!!!!! The secret organization called 'The Eye', has enough power (and in a too obvious comparison to the Illuminati) to pull some strings and easily make Ruffalo an FBI agent.Now. You can call the tricks unbelievable to your taste, and that's your taste. But they are more or less as unbelievable as the one of the Ocean's Eleven movies. In my opinion, the movie is good enough to let you forget the implausibility of all and ejoy it",6,0,2,22 September 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Amazing action. Trash everything else.
","Trashy script (the worst in the MCU, by a mile), characters (with minimal motivations, contradictory to the core of the characters, or not motivation at all) and realism (with ridiculous and contradictory actions and consequences, not only to our real life, but even the Mcu itself).But also great visually (with a handful of epic shots), action (in general, but especially the first chase scene) and a perfect conclusion of the movie, even if the way to get there was terrible.Infant level politcs, with infant level motivations for the characters, with infant level justifications for the Accords, with 'naive' worldwide politics (the UN controlling what could be considered the biggest army in the world in the Avengers? That's so stupid).The only real discussion was oversight (Tony doesn't want the blame anymore) or not (Steve Rogers knows that they would become inmoral as soon as their oversight made them do something for the interest of a part against another). And that was about 40 lines and less than 5 minutes. Civil War? Idiotic.Thank God for Black Panther and the action, because the rest was TRASH.",5,0,1,12 April 2020
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," An adolescent tone ruined interesting ideas
","What I mean is that the adventurer tone of the original movies was perfect for the characters. Unwise kids fascinated and scared, reacting to the unknown world. That's fun to watch and the naïve kids discovering how the world works is a blast and believable family entertainment. To me, doing the same thing with adults is often a terrible decision. It could be good but it's harder to pull off. When the characters and overall story are introduced in the first 40 something minutes, the new ideas for this saga feel fresh and interesting (wizards against humans conflict, prejudice, wizards in opposition of how to face their problem with the humans, etc.), but around that time, the 'adventure tone' takes over the movie, with 'sweet' and 'scary' set pieces ala Harry Potter but again, with 30 years old in the places of the kids. The kid friendly tone felt, to me, forced and kind of ridiculous and unbelievable. The jokes; the 'fantastic beasts' introduced; the relationships formed by the characters; felt more appropriated for younger audiences or characters. The 4 leads were basically 4 clichés walking. Reacting exactly in the most generic ways to everything. The villains are done better, but they have little screen time.The visual effects were kind of weak for the most part, although they really delivered in the third act. The score was fine, but it wasn't especially good. The acting was fine too, with only Fogler making a 100% cliché of a character tolerable. A character that could've been pretty annoying in other hands. In the end, it just didn't work for me and if this is the tone the saga is going to go for, it would probably not make me fall in love like the original.",5,0,1,6 February 2020
Ocean's Eleven," A perfect heist movie
","At plain sight, is a pretty standard heist movie. A couple of leaders that wants to do the heist, the recruitment of the people needed with their special abilities, establishing the heist for the spectator and the action.But what's different here is how perfect everything is. The cast is insane, because it's not just about being good actors with these type of movies. You need certain glamour, flair, that can give flavour to the often rigid story related to the heist itself and the required details for it to work and matter. That space given to the actors to spice up the needed exposition is the key to separate themselves from the mediocre ones. The editing and score are important to make the exposition as dynamic as possible too. Finally, the action in the third act has to create tension and surprises related to the original plan, and in this one, is created with perfect timing and subtlety.
Perfect. Perfect heist movie.",10,1,1,9 June 2020

","This might be the smartest kids movie ever. Maybe not the best, nor the more emotional, nor the one with the better message, but the smartest with every single decision being just perfect.
It helps that the voice casting was perfect too.
Some little things: the father was considered dumb by the mother, while she's never seen in any bad light, giving the impression of a perfect woman and a dumb man, for no real reason. Quite insignificant, by the way. Another: it played the stereotypes with the 'emotions' in the protagonist head, and the fact that sadness was fat may be a little... well, questionable. Maybe it isn't. I don't know.Story, design, colors, creativity, coherence, psychology. Everything just works.",10,1,3,25 February 2019
Resident Evil," Good fun movie.
","Entertaining movie based on a video-game. That's not an easy job.They managed to create a compelling personal story for the main protagonist (Mila) and explained the context and plot very efficiently.Once the action kicks in, the pace is great and the survival aspect mesh really well with the intriguing plot. The characters are thin, of course, but they work too, without annoying 'comic-relief only' or 'the defenseless'.I don't know, but I'm sure someone could find plot-holes, but overall, if they exist, you don't notice while watching this good video-game zombi movie.",6,5,6,29 March 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Arrow level first act. GOOD middle. EPIC 3rd act.
","I'm a bit disappointed on the melodramatic first act. It was a really, really poorly written melodramatic first act.It was, with Black Panther and Hulk, the most boring passage of a Marvel MCU movie. Some great parts here and there (mostly Tony, which was basically god like perfect in this movie, including Downey's perfect acting) and Rocket.When the actual movie starts (and stops being basically an epilogue, a bad one, to Infinity War), it gets interesting even if a bit confusing (even with three hours, the plot explanation goes fast).And in the end, the movie lands the epic ending. No words necessary.Also, I would never watch that first hour and a half again. Which is a shame, considering how perfect Infinity War was.-------Oh I forgot (this is an edit). Captain Marvel was in this movie (barely). I absolutely ADORE HER in every aspect. Her attitude. Her character. The actress. The looks.But oh boy, her power level!

No Country for Old Men," Overrated
","Overrated. The ridiculous characters that the Cohen Brothers create are fun to watch, no doubt. There is also something to be said about the amount of action set pieces that you can watch non-stop, without any kind of dialogue or character development. The filmmakers are amazing at visually tell the story, but it gets boring. One guy going after the other for 1 hour straight is too much. So, lets talk about the characters. Like I said, all fun to watch, but...
Our 'hero': purposely made less likeable than typically. The movies asks you the question: 'would you like this guy?' And that was awesome. But after, they make him dumb so the movie can start with the action and persecutions. He goes back to the place where he stole the money because he was guilty about letting a guy die without giving him water. This is insanely stupid and took me out of the movie. Why they would make him like this? Either make him a guy with grey morals towards 'good' or good. This guilt induced stupidity seemed out of character and just needed for the plot.Then you have Chigurh. In the end, we can't really know if he was a myth or not. He might be as terminator as he looked it was, or maybe what we see is not really what it happened. There's no way to know. He was a monster impossible to destroy and more a charicature representing nihilism than anything else.Finally, Tommy Lee Jones absolutely being old very well. You know, because he's old? Im tired already. The movie gets boring, but is still good because it presents some ideas not as often touched on Hollywood, and making fun characters to watch when they stop a bit with the action set pieces. The movie works, but its far from a masterpiece.",6,2,6,5 August 2018
Batman Begins," The real Batman
","After 15 years of the 'not even close' Burton version, Nolan brings the real vigilante to the screen.Based in as much realism as possible, we get to really know Bruce Wayne, his psychology, his philosophy, his traumas and the things that molded his vision to become 'The Batman'.In terms of the plot, in typical Nolan fashion, we have an intricate thread of plots that get tangled all together into a massive story that culminates with Batman taking on itself to improve Gotham. We see how everything that happened to Bruce Wayne lead him to become Batman, and how the villains of this particular movie ended up rounding up his character and beliefs as both Bruce and Batman.
We also see the decayed Gotham, run by the corrupt, as another 'character'.With an amazing cast top to bottom (I guess the Batman voice choice can be questionable) the only bad things are:
-The awful Katie Holmes. 5 more minutes onscreen could've made more damage
-The action, sometimes great and sometimes mediocre
-Maybe the lenght. I don't have that problem, but I like long movies, so I guess it can be bad for some.",10,0,0,14 April 2020
Twilight," So bad it was entertaining
","With undescriptable scenes that don't advance the plot nor develop the characters; rushed scenes that do not connect with what came before or next; and scenes that open questions that are immediately dropped and never answered, this movie is a clear example of 'ironic entertainment'.But it is bad. Just a bad product. The cinematography is bad and repetetive with constant boring close ups, making the movie more dull that already was on paper. The story is minimal and better told, didn't need 2 hours. There is not evolution for the characters that mostly stay the same for entire movie. The motivations for their actions are questionable or abrupt. And last, the acting. With minimal roles for the rest, only the two leads have enough time showcase their talents. I think Pattinson showed potential in spite of the script, while Stewart showed just plain and simple lack of talent. She barely showed any emotion, so she nailed just the parts where her character was confused and failed miserably in all the rest.In the end, I had fun, but it was really bad.",3,1,2,31 May 2020

I just couldn't possibly sympathize with that being such a big deal enough to harm a friendship.It's probably on me, but I couldn't care less if the wedding was the best ever or not, and probably that wasn't even the point, but got in the way of the enjoyment for me. Besides, I just didn't laugh much.BUT. The romance in the movie was actually awesome. I wanted to see it much, much more.

Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Trying to be Marvel is easy... failing is too
","Putting jokes everywhere to cut tension, drama or exposition is a big part of the amazing Marvel formula. It works because, in general, they do a great job with it. Sometimes with bad jokes, but always with great timing.So here we are with an... 'spy movie'? Barely any espionage. Impossible mission? Technically. But there is barely a mission in this movie. It seems more a continuity of improvisations from Ethan Hunt and his team. No tension about the effectivity of a great plan because there is no big plan to begin with. It is more a series of complications to be resolved randomly or sometimes by straight force. The writing just sucks. And because the writing sucks, they try to hide it behind bad jokes that break the tone of this type of movie, but more than anything this franchise, that used humor sparsely before.An spectacular trash of an spy movie.",2,0,2,21 June 2020

Also, the characters are really complex. I was engaged by all their stories and lives.But, I was disgusted by how they approached this story. It reverses the reality and turns our sympathy towards the other side, begging us to understand how unfair this stories usually go in real life. And that's just perverse, knowing (as the creators all should) how big the problem really is, how difficult is to fight back to make it better, and how rare is the occasion were the problem wasn't more than an scam/lie from one side to victimize itself.But even in disgust, I can't deny how good the movie was.",9,1,1,27 October 2019

A pristine presentation of characters and context with subtle and not that subtle social commentary that couldn't possibly feel more true.Then, in the second act, the horror starts to take shape but never really gets into form. Anyways, the set-up for a great finale is there.And then the third act is quite a jump from the rest of the movie. The resolution felt totally fake, out of that world and not true to the characters and context presented in the movie before.The themes are there, the ideas are there, the talent is there, but the plot asks too much suspension of disbelief and I don't like over the top endings for 'smart movies'.

Insidious," Late to the series. It was fine but this is no The Conjuring
","I struggled a bit with this one. To be honest, this might be the worst James Wan movie I've seen so far.He plays, like always, with horror movies clichés, but in this one they are boring. I was bored. Its possible that I just miss Farmiga (just perfect). Rose Byrne is actually pretty good (good in Bridesmaids, excellent in the small roles on the X-men movies). She does fine, but its less memorable.Having said that, It picks up once they finally accept that ghosts exists.
And then it picks up again with the final twist, which I didn't see coming. It just didn't work for me anyways. When i say that 'it picks up' is that the movie starts to go faster, not necessarily better. I didn't love the first slow half, and I didn't love the scares of the second half.",5,0,0,5 August 2018
The Theory of Everything," A better version of 'A Beautiful Mind'
","The focus is more Hawking the person, than Hawking the genious, and giving the complexity of his work, I think that was a smart choice. And it's not completely forgotten. They 'dumb down' the science and try to include it enough to show how smart this guy is, but not to go over the head of the 'not that smart'.A violent score almost force emotion on us. And it kind of works. The movie had me 'almost crying' every 20 minutes or so. A little 'too Disney' at moments, but typical of Hollywood bios. This time, it was effective with me. The acting from Redmayne (Hawking) and Jones (Jane Hawking) were awesome, helped by a bunch of moments to show off (some subtle, some melodramatic).In the end, cliched, with too much melodrama but all well done, the smart decision of not go too much into the absurdly complicated science, good acting and a coherent story of 'overcoming the adversities'.PD: The use of God and Hawking's perspective about it through the film, I think is particularly smart (even I don't like how present God is in the story about a scientist) and I gave an extra point for it.",7,0,1,23 January 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," An unparalleled Epic
","Because this one was built on the foundations of the first one. And it used that advantage to show all the epicism of the Tolkien story. A non-stop story (with the only exception being a sequence to reinforce Aragorn's love story). The scenes either advanced the plot at a brisk pace or were action sequences (that also advanced the plot in one way or another). There's not a lot of character development and that's not a fault. The story and characters remain PG, therefore complexity and nuance storytelling aren't the focus (there is a tiny bit more of light politics with the realms and their conflicts though).Another great thing is that stop abusing the same resources (slow motion with no music and echo voices) in the 'heart fealted moments', either because there aren't as many or because the editing changed. There is a fair amount for a 3 hour Epic, but not more than necessary, like in the first one.Last thing that makes this movie perfect is, of course, the larger role played by Gollum's Andy Serkis, which steals every second he's onscreen. The rest of the acting is equally good than in the first movie, with a special mention for the great David Wenham (Faramir), replacing the great Sean Bean (Boromir)",10,0,0,10 May 2020
The Lion King," Best animation ever and it's not particularly close
","OH MY GOD! With everyone complaining about the 'expressionless animals' I wasn't expecting sooooooo much expression. They do smile (a bit), and express compassion, love and fear (but of course, not like the 94' cartoons, that would be unrealistic and dumb).Did someone notice these guys made animals talk? I repeat. Animals talking! Real animals talking. It's incredible!So:
Visually: Best animation ever
Story: Really good, but it feels a bit for kids, a bit simplistic.And then the problems:
Acting: Some great (Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar and the comedic trio of Rogen as Pumba, Oliver's Zazu and Billy Eichner's amazing Timon), some lackluster (Glover's Simba) and some lame (Beyoncé as Nala)Music: Really bad. I didn't remember the original songs, and now in home I'm listening and they improved 'Be Prepared' (Scar song); and maintained the good Hakuna and Circle of Life.
Other than that, the music is the same with some new ones added. And all of them were AWFUL. Disgusting music. So freaking BORING! I HATED IT. The 'Coco' soundtrack may as well be the entire Johann Sebastian Bach life work compared to this.
And that's why it wasn't perfect.",8,2,9,24 July 2019
The Incredibles," You can't just stop being mature at some point in the movie...
","So. The presentation of the characters and the themes presented about normal human problems (midlife crisis for the 'Family Dad' losing his youth and/or masculinity with a meaningless job; the 'mother' that gave up everything personal to raise the children; socially awkward teenage
uncomfortable with what she is; little kid learning the responsibility and dangers of his powers/virtues) is awesome.
Maybe even a bit too long? I loved it.After that, it gets into the story, the Syndrome (villain) character and the other overall theme: exceptionality. This movie reaffirms that some people are just better than others (which, yeah true I guess?), and every effort to try to make life and rules similar for everybody, is bad (socialism/communism is bad).
As a leftist, I do not agree with the movie, but what they want to communicate, they do and perfectly.My problem is with the characters towards the end. When the 3rd act starts, all the nuanced characterization and matured reaction of every human, is thrown out of the window.
Characters do stuff and the movie never even comes close to make them ponder with what they did. That wouldn't be such a big problem if earlier in the movie, characters reflect on their decisions or think before they act.One example: Mr. Incredible has the chance to do something to try to get the job done, but it is immoral. He doesn't do it, showing that he is, in fact, a hero that deserves the special treatment he asks (and the movie asks) for. Later in the movie, he just does that immoral act, and while totally justifiable, the movie acts like it was nothing, making the earlier scene totally irrelevant, because then, our hero is good because we say it's good, not because of his entire characterization. Anyways. Great movie, but there are some really small things here and there like this.",9,0,0,14 July 2019
A Quiet Place," Thank you people, for recomending this!
","What a piece of. It was a dangerous, difficult idea to make it fun and good.
A family story underdeveloped. 
The Sci-Fi is not explained. 
No twists. 
'Scary scenes' that aren't scary nor originals in any sense. 
Dumb conclusion. 
Paper thin characters. 
Emily Blunt was in the only great and best scene of the movie.
Honestly. There is no reason for this movie to exist.
It could've tried to be súper smart, explaining everything, and showing step by step how to survive this kind of apocalypse. 
Or it could've tried to be dumb, not taking itself too seriously about the story, and having fun.
This was neither. They acted like it was smart, but couldn't sustained it with characters and atention to details, so they put just enough dumb things to make it 'fun'. It was neither.",2,0,1,14 August 2018

","From start to the end, I just liked this movie. It was fun (even if not really that 'funny'. I don't remember great jokes and its more like a fun ride than anything else). It is as sweet as it is unrealistic. The story and plot is perfect. The kids are all stereotypes, which could be problematic for some, but I didn't find any malice in the archetypes presented. I feel it was more about saving time, presenting the characters in ways that everybody would recognize with ease, instead of judging them.

","My God. Even if the first one wasn't technically a good film, at least you could enjoy the weirdness and not get ever bored. That didn't happen with this one. The first hour is almost unwatchable, with a depressed Bella after Edward abandons her.The movie shows us the play Romeo and Juliet, so we can force a conexion with it and the story we watch about these two lovers. But it doesn't work at all, and that forces the writers to make characters act in contradictory ways all of a sudden so they can force the comparison with the classical.What we do have is boring scenes that amount pretty much to nothing until sudden changes force a huge jump in the plot, for then a bunch of scenes of nothing until the next jump, often requiring characters to appear out of nowhere to force those changes. There is no tension because there doesn't seem to be a logical story progression and then we are at the end of the story in the third act, and barely anything happened.A bad, awful 'romantic' teen story. I liked the CGI when used, and some scenes here and there, but this one was bad and boring.",2,0,1,2 June 2020

Non-characters ala 'Dunkirk', but without actually committing to it, giving the two leads a handful of 'emotional moments and lines' (some fine, some absolutely ridiculous and forced) typical of usual archetypes and basic 'emotional arcs'. A gimmick (a really impossibly hard gimmick) 'one shot movie', that is ultra clearly not one shot and requires excessive 'non scenes' where nothing happens other than people slowly walking, slowly crawling, slowly jogging. And a handful of specially great and breathtaking visual sequences that has little to nothing to do with being 'a one shot movie'. Those same sequences in a 'normal movie' would've been incredible too, regardless.So. A zero for the story. A zero for the characters. A zero for the score. A ten for the technical tricks. A ten for the imaginative ways of putting action and the ways there were filmed. A ten for that handful of amazing visual parts. And a zero for the absolutely ridiculous moments that are supposed to give you the chills.I guess if you were 'into the movie' from the start, and the trick one shot made you feel 'there with the protagonists', then those moments would've way more impact to you and increase the enjoyment.

The mystery mishandled (so many chances to build up tension are missed because they basically tell you why the mystery could be so important). Giving the budget, the action scenes are fine, but honestly they mishandled that too, because the character is a reclusive nut from the start, so when things start to get more dangerous, he... is still a reclusive nut.Toooooooo many scenes with his health problem that were almost literally the same.

Dumb and Dumber," All time great
","And it's not nostalgia, because I watched it recently and I still laughed quite a lot, even knowing exactly what was going to happen. And that's because the performances from Carrey and Daniels are impossibly good, lifting a still pretty great script with constant amount of jokes, into a masterpiece. I don't even really like peak Carrey's comedies like 'Ace Ventura' or 'The Mask', but here, he was reigned in and 'unleashed' in enough doses to make the movie better for it and not just his sideshow.And that's because the script allows it, with incessant jokes and gags, while naturally developing the story at the same time, filling the gaps with scenes with heart that counter balance the darker ones. Because the humor comes from how these two idiots see the world and how poorly they interpret what is happening to them, even situations that mostly help to advance the plot are made in a really hilarious way. Yes there is a plot, even if thin.One more thing. For a movie from 1994, is quite surprising how it's not that offensive, without recurring to cheap sexist and racist jokes all the time, like the more lazy or inept writers often do (see, Adam Sandler movies).",10,1,1,10 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Intellectually superior but really flawed movie
","All the themes always touched by the franchise are done with a more sophisticated perspective. Sometimes it contradicts the 'truths' of the Star Wars saga. Good and evil is a bit more complicated of an issue. There is more than rebels and empire, a class of people that benefits from it. The knowledge of 'The Force' shouldn't be only in Jedis hands. The ego in trying to be heroic vs. the real heroic act of sacrifice without wanting to be recognize for it. Etc.Again, most of them are part of the franchise, but are often simplified. The problem is that it sacrificed entertainment to make it happen. The amount of subplots (Luke and The Jedi, Snoke and The Sith, Rey and Kylo, Poe's character development, Finn's character development) and the way they were executed, made the movie a bit tedious.In the end, the core of this movie was the Kylo and Rey 'fight with the Force', their past, and their 'destiny'.

Mission: Impossible II," Like the original, overall it works. Good movie.
","For the first hour it seemed destined to be an improvement on the original, basically because we have less pointless terrible characters to start the movie, just the important ones, and a much better score. The script maybe slightly worse, but with enough intrigue to make it work.But after that first hour, the movie starts to get less intelligent and more pure action, which is very good, but it gets repetitive and generic fast. The problem of mediocre characters is not resolved. The villain is clearly worse. The script loses a bit of attention to details and twists to let the action shine.There some plotholes with the main issue of the movie the disease, and the criminal abuse of the 'mask and voice chip' to trick someone.

","This movie is the worst of the trilogy. It repeats almost everything bit by bit from the original without blushing, taking away any chance of being surprised by it. A copy that only changes little non fundamental details puts the nail in the coffin with a terrible script filled of bad jokes. Like almost every sequel, tries to intensify what it worked in the original, so all the malice and dark humor morphs into just unlikeable and boring situations and 'jokes' (there are exceptions).The directions, score, acting. None of that is bad per se. It's actually on the same level than before, but all of those aspects get bog down with the original scene (copy paste).This is literally a self plagiarism from Phillips, but instead of improving the worst parts and make the good ones even better, everything is just worse. Unfunny jokes and just incredible situations. What was a laugh about something bad that happened to a 'bro', now it is just a total lack of care for each other.

Avengers: Age of Ultron," Broken characters. Broken pace. Broken villain. Broken, but big.
","This one doesn't work. It has a lot of potentially awesome things. Ultron could've been an amazing villain with a philosophy (post-humanism, something that X-Men Apocalypse attempted to do as well), a team broken by their worst nightmares (thanks to Scarlett's powers), and the evolution of the team after their 'first mission' together.
But it just didn't reach the potential.The (a bit) darker story didn't match the light Joss Whedon tone, where everybody speaks with one-liners and witty dialogue (which also sucks, because it makes all the characters pretty much the same thing and it gets old fast).The nightmares were great, but instead of sticking with them, they only helped to break the pace with a bunch of boring angsty scenes that amounted nothing, because the consequences from them were non-existing. Nobody grew from them. Tony's fears made him to commit the same mistake than before (not trusting anybody); Bruce Banner was again weak and even if morally against it, he didn't stop Tony; Hawkeye presented his family, and now we know who he cheated with Black Widow?; Black Widow considered herself a monster because she remembered that she couldn't have kids (what? That makes her the Hulk? What?); Captain America disliked Tony's attitude... again.
Whatever. Ultron was the worst part. He believed in post-humanism (he was that), and yet, the scenes with him were all used to showcase a 'What if Tony Stark were a villain?' instead. Funny to some, I guess, but terrible for a villain.Another thing that changed too fast? Scarlet and Quicksilver going from villains to heroes. Weak.Having said that, the humor works at times, of course, the action is fun even if the stakes low, and the movie goes fast (other than the halt in the middle).",5,1,4,12 April 2019
The Dark Knight," My favorite movie ever!
","This is my favorite movie. It's not even that close, actually.
Before watching TDK, I watched movies and that was it. It was fun or it wasn't. I wasn't (and probably Im not, necessarily) a comic book fan.And then that trailer went up (on TV?) and I just got hyped by the new Joker interpretation. Not because I was already a fan, but because it was taking a cool concept that I knew (like Nicholson's Joker) and make it REAL.
It was obvious that the Joker was a metaphor for terrorists and it became obvious that Batman would be the USA in this 'metaphor'. But I never expected the movie to go as DEEP into this allegories and EXCEED them.The movie not only talked about post 9-11 USA and the 'fight against terror'. Yeah, that's just the most important and obvious layer.
Then you have the literal interpretation: the amazingly fun and intricate (yeah yeah, with a few plot holes) Heist movie.
But a third layer (that I'm aware of, at least) it's the more comicbooky one. The representation of the fight between opposites. Amoral/Chaos vs. Human search for order. Tons of movies have philosophy but this one takes its time to make it compelling, clear, and fun without losing the focus of the other, more grounded layers (symbolic fight vs terror and heist action movie).I have watched this movie, from start to finish without skipping one second, at least 15 times, and I would watch it again sooner or later.Only two things bugged me (on probably the 10 or 12 re-watch):-The School Bus breaks to huge Bank entrance but it's in perfect state when it is aligns itself into the others. Totally done for the cool factor, I would've preferred a less destructive version, with the Buss being parked in front of the bank instead of breaking the bank's gate.
-The other is Two-Faces shooting the driver in the car... while he's still there. Again, done for the (admittedly GREAT) cool factor.But in a 2.30+ hrs movie, those are nitpicks. So yeah, the best ever for me!",10,0,0,28 August 2018

This is a masterpiece on every facet of cinema.
The story is complex, with an original structure and super natural and deep dialogue.
The acting from the protagonists was amazing (hard to believe this was the same actress that made Titanic, and even Jim Carrey disappears on the role, except for two or three moments). Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Dunst weren't that great (in smaller roles) and the rest of the cast was serviceable/good.

","Now having seen all the story, I believe everything died in the third movie, when the love triangle was solved. For better or worst, that was the heart of the franchise (the fantasy world building was always done poorly).
Again the writers elude the real and natural conflicts: Bella's moral dilemma of needing human blood for a while; How is Bella going to disappear from his community now that she can't appear in daylight? Those things are resolved in two short scenes. Basically, 'it doesn't matter'.Ok, then more time for the final conflict between the Cullen and the 'orthodox vampire clan', with two different views of what to do to preserve the entire race survival.But the road to the resolution of that conflict was filled of incredibly boring scenes, with characters without any weight, personality or motivation to participate (even the movie makes fun of how easily they are convinced to do so). About that ending, I can understand some may like it. I just didn't.To end this. It's embarrasing how bad the CGI is (except when the wolfs do not interact with anything), considering how much money these mfs made. The score is also non-existant or lame. The acting, is hard to know with this script, but still: I think Pattinson was at his worst; Stewart confirmed simply lack of talent (at that point, at least); and Taylor Latuner was giving an inexplicable character, and he didn't do anything to make it better.

Mission: Impossible," It works. Forgettable
","A first act, not boring exactly but close, we get to know this group of international agents/spies in a very urgent and important mission. After it goes wrong, the movie actually gets more interesting with the consequences of that failure.
The intricated story and script is by far the better aspect of the movie. From the minute 35 and on, we have a non-stop of a interesting action thriller, with well done tension and good twists.Having said that, the start is somehow slow, even when it is basically a 30' mission. That includes the presentation of a huge bunch of pathetically boring characters, without any personality or charm. Literally non of them is either likeable or memorable. I guess all the attention was paid to the plot, but the lack of good characters contributed for a very dry film.
I also didn't like the editing, that didn't make the first act exciting in any way (again, it was a mission), nor the score that was barely in the movie at the start and by the end was so invasive and loud and pointless (maybe compensating for the lack of good characters?).

","But the movie it is a musical. And even if a couple are fine, and one is excellent ('City of Stars'), the true is that I just can't understand the fascination with these genre. Â¿What is the interesting part of hearing music that you wouldn't ever in your entire life? Music that is not necessarily even good? Sung by actors that aren't close to professional singers/musicians? And with songs that need less harmony and rhyme so they can tell complex stories instead of being beautiful? I just don't get it, unless every song is at the level of 'City...'. It's not the case.Besides that fundamental flaw, the rest of the movie is excellent (even If clichÃ©). The characters are fun and the actors gave them a bit of distinct personality to differentiate them from the archetypes they probably are without them. Even Emma Stone is good on this one (I don't think she's good, but here she is). Visually is excellent. The director of photography catches the attention more than the director here with a gorgeous to look at movie. The script, again, a bit clichÃ©, but it's understandable given the genre, that the movie couldn't get too complex anyway. The music (not musical set pieces) and all that is related to it, is great too (Jazz).In the end, if you enjoy (for some reason) a musical, then you would love this movie.

","The movie has a really well written story, with every detail esencial for the plot, delivered slowly (maybe too slowly) through the lenght of the film. Dialogue just ok. Acting, not even that.
The 'torture porn' aspect is of course off putting to mainstream audiences, and apparently even a portion of horror fans, but for the rest, we appreciate the smarts on how and why is introduced, not only justified, but neccesary to the whole point of the saga (that yes, it has a point too).
Also, Jigsaw is the best horror villain ever. Of course, is not as important as the first ones (Freddy, Jason), because those were pioneers, but overall, there is no debate. Philosophically and psychologically, Jigsaw is a real character, not a fantastical one. It's as real as it gets and as brutal and efficient as the others without the magic/fantasy aspects. He's just perfect, including how iconic he's visually too (the doll, the laugh, the pig mask).Having said that, talking just about this one and not the whole saga, the policial procedure and the dramatic (based on the personal stories of the people involved) parts of the movies that aren't about Jigsaw himself, are pretty mediocre (probably in part because of the acting).

If you don't, this one won't have anything original that would make you like it, but if you do like clever 'cat and mouse' stories, this one is elite.There is the exact amount of tension, never turning into melodrama. Also never stalling, having enough tricks to get the story excitement while the whole heist gets done.Some may think the Jodie Foster character is unnecessary, maybe?

This movie, because its a fantasy, gets to create a world were everything is a charicature, and if this wins an Oscar, then exactly why can't a comic book movie like Logan or the Dark Knight then?Now about sexual diversity. Im all for it (unless it hurts others). But it was neccesary make an R rated Disney fantasy to do so? There aren't smarter or less in-your-face ways? I don't know.The really great thing beyond cinematography? For once Americans authorities are as bad as Russians authorities. But this nuanced view just looks ridiculous in this movie, that has everything except a nuanced approach.So yeah. Really inmature in a lot of senses. But apparently is awesome somehow.",5,1,3,20 August 2018
The Untouchables," Another possible title: 'SCORE: the movie'
","What? All this time thinking this was a classic and 'I should see it'... for this?I gave it a two because of the actors and production. My GOD!This movie is ANNOYING. The score is the most intrusive ever AND its awful anyways. Its also dumb. The Score seems to be a reflection of another movie. Let me explain: Its like if I say 'NO' with my voice, but 'YES' with my head, at the same time. Silly music with heavy visual stuff. Melodramatic music before almost a comedic scene where Kostner's and Connery's characters meet for the first time. And I could go on.The movie is about a real life event and its presented almost as a silly adventure. Its insane. Characters act silly while doing something vile, but then another might react getting grossed out, and the very next one act like a cartoon, while other might not even react at all.Even Michael Bay would make this movie much better (with the same budget and technology). Ok. Maybe not. But you get the point. PD: Cinematography is pretty great, but in this awful movie, its just not as important.",2,5,16,29 September 2018
The Disaster Artist," It works despite Dave Franco
","The movie is more serious than I thought it would be, considering the trailer. It has a lot of comedy, but it's not a parody of Tommy Wiseau and the production of the infamous 'The Room'. A lot of parts end up being funny because of the natural Tommy's extravagance manners, but not because the comedy was forced in. As a bio movie, I think it works well, with an amazing James Franco performance.Having said that, everything that is good is almost destroyed by the terrible Dave Franco casting. Not only he doesn't look the role, but his overenthusiastic overacting simply contradicts the role he needed to play here. He had tons of scenes that required a nuanced and more natural reaction, but almost every scene was ruined by his energy. When he tries to act like a more reserved and shy person, it fails spectacularly.Even then, the story is well told (although some parts didn't happen like that in real life) and it has heart. I was expecting something bizarre but I was pleasantly surprised with an acceptable flick that James Franco makes good.",6,2,3,4 January 2020
Zombieland," Being dumb is fine. Too dumb? That's annoying.
","The movie started well enough, explaining the rules of this world with Jesse Eisenberg's character. It got dumber but cool and fun enough with Woody's introduction, but started to lose strength after twenty plus minutes to never recover. Everything after the introduction of the Emma Stone's character was just not funny, lame, cliché storytelling and ridiculous stuff after ridiculous stuff. There is an audience for that, and they deserve this movie of course, I'm just not part of it.Our protagonists have arcs, we find out at the very... very end of the movie. It serves the only purpose to make sure we all know that the writers know how dumb the movie is, because they know how to write, just that this movie doesn't need them to do it. The 'arcs' come with no emotional weight whatsoever.",2,2,7,27 October 2019
A Beautiful Mind," Crowe and the acting is amazing. The writing is not.
","This is the work of a professional. Ron Howard knows how to manipulate us. Here's the important scene at the start. Here's the big moment, etc. Here it comes the music to help you cry or feel. But in the end, its soulless. Even if Crowe tries, this just wasn't a man. This was an edited life of a real man. Edited enough for you to like him without trying to really understand a troubled man and his problems. Because its 'well done' it gets a five. But it doesn't elevates beyond average.",5,0,1,5 August 2018
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A step back. Extremely boring.
","Again the execution is terrible. The movie has awful pace and no grace. The director choses to make everything slow, like thinking the kids in the audience wouldn't be able to follow a brisker pace, but without filling the scenes with anything other than plot related stuff. So the scenes are filled with exposition and not much else other typical bad jokes here and there. The exception is Kenneth Branagh (with limited time). Other than that, this movie is too boring and dull.And it repeats itself too much with the same structure over and over. Harry investigates; danger; something magical (often from an external source) saves him at the last second; scene is over. Harry investigates; danger; something magical saves him at the last second; scene is over. And repeat. It's lame.The story itself also isn't particularly great, but I guess another director could've created a more enjoying experience out of it.

Psycho," Questionable ending of an amazing thriller
","I would normally discount some points for the sudden conclusion and unnecessary exposition, but considering that it was 1960, maybe it was neccesary.Besides that, the incredible performances from Vera Miles and Anthony Perkins brought to life such a duo of complex and superb characters, with the use of the highest level of acting, including complete body and facial expressions, helped by a great and natural dialogue that made the intriguing plot to grow in tension with every minute, flowing with total harmony right until the last couple of scenes.",10,0,1,21 November 2019
Hercules," Hercules movie, saved by Hades
","It's absolutely criminal that Hades (James Wood), by a large margin the best part of the flick, has so little screen time. Every single one of his interventions and lines was either funny, great (or both). The character's design is strange, but it couldn't be better for this interpretation of Hades. The final act (in which one he participates a lot) is really good and completes a simplistic theme/message in the movie. With all of this, the movie gets a pass as a good film, even if not Disney's best.From the rest, there is little to nothing to praise. The animation and designs are questionable, the score and songs, poor. The voice actors, boring. The jokes, ok at best. The story basic and unremarkable. There is one line 'being famous is not the same as being heroic' that sounds like social commentary (how we are obsessed with being famous/successful while the best thing is being heroic/morally better), but is not supported in the rest of script, so I'm not convinced it is more than a good line and nothing else.",6,0,1,23 November 2019
Wedding Crashers," The story could work with other actors
","I don't hate the story. Actually, it has potential. Two womanizers find that point in life. Go!But the writers and leads fail at making the characters possible of redemption in such a limited time. Plus, the characters don't find love, they find two absolutely devastatingly beautiful women that have ZERO reasons to be with them.In the end, I 'get' why any of you would like it, so, contrary to other cases (like 'Idiocracy' or 'Gamer'), I understand that I might be in the wrong here, giving how little the leads make me laugh in general (Vince Vaughn in particular, its absolutely awful in my opinion).Still, I can't just lie about the fact I didn't laugh more than two or three times, I barely chuckle, and I found the romance to be criminally unearned.",1,1,5,13 September 2018
Joker," One of the hardest things is living to the hype. It's even better.
","Little to say. I expected a masterpiece of a movie only based on comic books, and concentrated only in a character study for the ages.It is.Perfect story. Twists. Real drama. Real pain. Darkly funny at times, but not comedic in the least. It is violent, as it should, but never glorifying violence like the rest of the comic book adaptations (even the ones I love like Man of Steel or Infinity War or...)It is just perfect. I give my 'Thanks' to all the people involved (I gave my money too, which is more important to them).----------- As a negative, It's not particularly original, with too many things (a few times, scenes) from King of Comedy and Taxi Driver.
It is clearly better than those movies though",10,19,38,4 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Well done, visually pleasing mediocrity
","2 movies and more than 5 hours in, I still don't know Pennywise powers (what can and can't he do), the extent of them (limits), what he wants, what he needs, etc. That's a big problem, because while the actors were mostly incredible (with the exception of Jessica Chastain that was fine, but doesn't really look like the same Beverly Sophia Lillis was playing), and the story that was told between the scary sequences was sweet and kind of great, the truth is these 'IT' remakes focus so much on the scary sequences that there is just not time to develop every character's arc. Because there is not time, the movie moves at an insane pace with a very repetitive mold. Literally every single character starts the 'development' in the same way and we see them deal with it one after the other. All this with flashbacks of every character that didn't add anything new to what the first movie showed.Like I say, after boring and repetitive stretches, we end up in the third act where insanity follows (that's a book problem, but the movie didn't solve it) and things just happens and the movie ends. The arcs are all resolved, but again, in such mechanical way that every emotion is dried up by the time it appears on screen. They forced the kids on this movie because we loved them, but they could've used all those minutes to explain better Pennywise (if that's even possible) and develop a more coherent story and a better flow through the plot.",5,1,1,10 September 2019
Stranger Than Fiction," A difficult film to make. Maybe it shouldn't have been made?
","I don't even pay attention to this page ratings anymore. I read one long review with a positive score, one long with a really low score and one that is closer to what I think, and that's it. 7.6? This? Lol.This story was probably really hard to make. It's kind of a really Nolan-like intelligent type of story, that plays with reality, time, and ever changing (or not?) destiny/end. And yet, the execution of this was so stupid, so ridiculous. I feel the producers and director just quit before even trying.And even then, you can cast Will Ferrell and try to take the most humorous parts of the story and tell it that way. If that's what they tried, I just didn't see it, because I didn't laugh (not even chuckle) once. The movie takes itself completely serious even when scene after scene, the acting it's so bad for a realistic take, making it looks worse for itself, second after second.I don't blame Will Ferrell in the least. He put his trust in Marc Foster and the casting director, and they let him down. A scene with Maggie Gyllenhaal in particular was so jarring to see. It was like someone mixed 'Anchorman' with 'You've Got Mail' and couldn't decide the tone they were going for so they just keep it like that instead of re shooting the whole thing.",1,1,10,20 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Good finish for the prequels, only behind Episode V
","One of the most interesting things told in a Star Wars movie, script wise. That last step from Anakin to become the Darth Vader that we already knew. Hayden improves quite a lot and, in general, gives us a fine performance in a hard role to play.Visually, also jumps way ahead of the other two prequels. I'm not saying the CGI looks ultra real or that the movie doesn't overuse it, but it definitely looks better and more refined, for the most part.But there are reasons for this one not to rise as high as 'Empire'.
The action sequences, all of them, are overlong to the point of becoming quite boring. And with one obvious exception, they lack any tension giving how easily the heroes decimate the enemies.
The Obi Wan separated plot is bland, kind of slow and repetetive.
And the acting fails in certain points/scenes (Christensen; Portman; McDiarmid) too. All of that is enough to put it one step behind the best one.",6,0,0,24 June 2020
Inception," This perfection, only in dreams
","All the possibilities of today's (2010) technology in service of a thrilling story. Like always with Nolan, there are intricacies, in this case: the dream levels.Plus, like always, the movie touches the theme of what is reality and what isn't, the relativity of time, it has a clear concept that delivers through the protagonist's actions, and leaves space for your own thoughts and interpretations.The cast it's as good as it gets and literally everybody is perfect.
You don't need jokes (even less so, cheap ones) every 20 seconds to have a fun movie.

Sherlock Holmes," Brutal Sherlock Holmes
","Excellent movie, filled with action but also enough slow moments for the story to unfold, with a mystery worthy of Sherlock Holmes and a good production design destined to evoke the Victorian Age that suits the character so well. Downey at his best, shows off a brutal version of the character, with all the great, good and bad. Maybe for some it would look too much like 'action figure', to extremely capable in combat. But I don't feel that way.Jude Law is very good in the 'sidekick role', although not that sure as 'Watson' (war veteran doctor). Still, he's good.Visually great, with some especially great action sequences, maybe the Irene Adler character (played by the always perfect Rachel McAdams) could've been better. The villains, fine.Maybe the worst thing about this movie is that the action, while always entertaining or better, sometimes can feel a bit like cartoony. Also, some parts in the second act can get slightly boring, but all of them are important in the conclusion, so it's not like they don't matter.",8,2,2,18 February 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," I didn't like it. With 20 minutes left, I struggled to finish it. That never happens to me!
","It's not like this subject matter was never explored before. The movie acted like it was doing something incredible. At some point it says 'people don't like this philosophical crap'.
Excuse me? Psychology? yes. Barely sociological? Maybe.
This can't possibly be considered philosophical.It started really well but by the hour, it started to lose steem. Every second spent on his daughter was unnecessary. Literally, there was no need for her to be a character with scenes on its own. The 'payoff' could've been enough for us to guess their relationship. And that it's the thing. The story doesn't work at all. No matter how good and hard to do is the 'one shot' movie. The thing is the story is not good at all. The actors are all great, but there is nothing else here.I don't know. I don't see it. I would've loved a movie about the hard work and 'crazy backstage' of a new Broadway play, with intricacies about 'how it works', and the politics that are involved into getting the money, the talent, and the critics support (or not). Whatever.",4,0,1,18 March 2019
Wonder Woman," Great superhero origin story
","Patty Jenkins gave the character a softness that was perfectly combined with the harshness of the worlds created by Snyder, where the violence is not funny, the wars leave victims and consequences, and where the evil is defeated but it doesn't wash away the pain it generated. In that dark world, Wonder Woman's (and/or Gal Gadot) light shines brighter.All Themyscira is perfect and beautiful, as it is all Diana's origin. But the story told works in more than the literal level. The script is superb and well above the generic ones. We have the literal Diana's adventure that ends up with her becoming the hero we know. Then we have the interpretation of War in the world. The naive notion that Diana has, about ending the world by defeating one villain. That translates to the believe that in our world there are clear 'good guys and bad guys' and with the defeat of the 'bad one' the wars would stop, when is clearly way more complicated than that.
And it also brings the notion of the people that benefits from War and tries to influence humans to give to them nature of war and conflict, for their benefit. I'm referring to Banks that finance wars, the industrial military complex or just plain and simply the militar arm of x country.And then we have Jenkins really using the Snyder visual style, with amazing sequences and fights choreography with slow motion, but also a bombastic third act that can be a bit much. The villains could've been a bit better. And maybe a bit faster here and there, maybe. Maybe one or two less 'slow motion' scenes.",9,4,13,9 June 2020
Marriage Story," Great acting, great writing = great movie
","I loved the story (about a divorce), regardless of who is based on, or how real is compared to it (the writer/director' life, apparently). The nuanced approach was phenomenal and very much needed for this emotional drama (we often have one sided Hollywood stories).The writing is almost perfect (you can always find lines to dislike if you try to).The acting is absolutely phenomenal, with both Scarlett and Driver, able to nail the most likeable and dislikeable aspects of their characters through the entire film.Like I said, you can always find something. In this one, a handful of 'artsy' scenes (about 10/15 minutes), too 'out there' for me (ridiculous and of questionable relevancy). Still, awesome movie.",9,6,9,10 December 2019
Black Panther," Hey! Your hero is weak! Isnt that GREAT!?
","The first hero that its dependant on stronger women is the black one! LOLAnyways. The movie is fine. Its only probably the most boring one in the entire MCU (not the worst).The villain COULDve been great. It wasn't. It just was better than the average Marvel villain, which is the lowest bar possible. He had a point, so by making it a psycho (kills anybody that gets in the way and cant form any kind of relationship because he's broken and all he has is hate blablal) makes it easier to relativize his ideas, right or wrong. This way, if you want to say 'he's right', you can say the movie supports that. If you want to say, 'of course he was wrong', you can say the movie supports that take. It's cheap. If you don't want to say anything about politics, why even pretend? Just don't touch politics.The hero could've been great. He couldve been this guy which needed tons of help to lead his people, but at least he was strong.
NOPE. He's weak and without the help of his little sister he would be dead. GREAT!And then the scenes in the ethereal world. MY GOD. What a boring waste of time (except the last scene, which should've been the only one there).",5,1,2,20 August 2018

-Great action sequences and score.
-Superb comedic timing with (mostly) good jokes.
-Good and realistic dialogue and actions from the characters.And then the third acts starts.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Glorious even if not perfect
","One of the best of the genre in a style that, by 2016, was already not really appreciated by the masses (or/and the media, influencing the masses).
With an elite script (except for the too fancy Martha thing), with perfect acting, Nolanistic 'realism', psychologically developed deep and real characters, metaphorical, philosophical and socially charged themes and story plots, and the often perfect visual spectacle typical of Zack Snyder (granted, only possible because of the budget).This is not a light movie, with characters with little to no motivations for doing what they do, except maybe the lazy ones 'my loved ones are in danger' crap. There are jokes, but not to cut tension and not to transform all in a dumb comedy after all. And that's good. The rejection for this movie made it one of the last to approach this genre with any intention to comunicate something, emotional, philosophical, social. That makes it more unique. In the future, for those wanting for something like that, with more weight and brain, it would be up there with the Nolan's Batman movies, Man of Steel, X-Men First Class, Winter Soldier, Infinity War, Logan, Joker).For the rest, they would have plenty to see while watching their cellphones and turning they brain off.",10,4,7,9 April 2020
The Emperor's New Groove," One of the funnier Disney movies
","The start is a bit strange, with a really unlikeable protagonist (with the magnificient David Spade interpretation), a particularly original visual design and the inclusion of flashbacks, with the lead remembering how he ended up in the situation that he starts with, also unusual. But the movie gets progressively better and funnier, and when it gets to the half (or start of the third act), everything break loose into a wild, ridiculous and more than anything, impossibly fun half/ending. The jokes are for kids, for adults, fourth wall breaking, and meanwhile we get more and more heartfelt moments, creating an uplifting good story without the need of forced monologues or melodramatics musicals.One last thing: Besides the great Spade, Patrick Warburton as Kronk and Eartha Kitt as Yzma gave a lot of soul to their comedic lines with their acting and voices. Even the awful John Goodman is not a disaster as 'Pacha'.",10,1,3,26 November 2019
Bruce Almighty," Ultra predictable, but entertaining
","This movie rest in the shoulders of Jim Carrey. There is almost literally nothing more.
We see a bit of his life before getting 'God's powers' and then the adventure and predictable tale about 'thinking well what you wish for', basically.
Carrey is not 'The Mask' or 'Ace Ventura' level of obnoxious, so the movie flows well with mostly dumb jokes, some better than others, and a bunch of actual real written jokes too.
Jennifer Anniston is there. It doesn't matter.
Steve Carrell has a criminal ultra small role, but he's the best part of the movie regardless.
It's fine. A good comedy with not much more to it than a predictable but well done message",6,0,0,13 April 2020

The last 30 minutes are better because, well, they are 'something', and that's already better than what we saw before. It finally gets to the point of the movie.
But even then, it wasn't particularly great, I don't think.I absolutely despise this movie. It completely wasted my (even if worthless) time.The wedding. MY GOD THE WEDDING!

Thor: The Dark World," The worst villain(s). I hate every second with the humans. But I love all of Asgard's.
","What can I say? This is not a very good movie for the simple fact that every second we get with the villains or the humans, the movie feels like a Transformers sequel. All the human and villains parts are exactly like Michael Bay's franchise, fill of: pathetic attempts of (very, very) low brow humor, terrible exposition, bad acting.The difference here is that we have another big junk of the movie that involves Thor, Loki and the Asgardians, and it's very good, probably more because of the actors (Hemsworth and Hiddleston are both amazing at what they do) than anything the movie does. Also, like in the first one, all the family drama and storyline is pretty good, and I liked the 3rd act, for the most part.So in the end, the movie is broken. They continued the totally unnecessary connection with the humans by forcing the storyline and they maintained the worst part of the 1st movie, and they sadly wasted an opportunity to make a really good Thor movie, which would end on Kevin's Feige decision to just parody and laugh at Thor in the sequel and last of the trilogy.",5,0,0,12 April 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Welcome to Epic Hell!
","This movie takes off from the already all time high epic ceiling in part II. Still not touched level of epicity.
The acting, the best of the trilogy (probably because this one allowed for more variety of great emotional moments, I believe).
The dialogue and symbolism works even better than before.
The battles and action sequences, insane.But I do feel there are some things that do not work, even if the enjoyment and emotional weight through the end is impossibly high.1) The Eagles. I don't mind the 'Deux Ex Machina'. But contrary to the Ents of the sequel, here the Eagles help the good guys because... There is no explanation why they participate in favor of the heroes, and why in the end and not before. It's a minor thing, but it could've had an explanation, like the Ents.2) The 'Dead Mercenaries'. All that subplot could've been longer, with more adventure and proving a bit more difficult than it was, giving time. I would've been fine with less fight in Tirith or less in the Mordor doors or else. I think it was too easy for how important and decisive ended up being in battle.3) Last. Frodo's arc. We were made to believe he was the hero, because he was the only one strong minded enough to resist temptation. And we saw him struggling to do it, which makes it great. And yet, at the last moment, Frodo ends up being no better than the others, including Isildur. The Ring gets destroyed almost by pure luck. If Gollum isn't there to stop an invisible Frodo, the Rign would still be operating. I don't understand how this improves the story in any way. It's not more mature, because the struggle to not lose the battle against temptation made it mature. This, made it pointless even. Random.
Of course, after that we get the amazing scene with Frodo dying and the symbolysm is beautiful and I don't care anymore, but it does bother me a bit when I think about it.",9,0,0,17 May 2020
Casino," Ridiculous over reliance in voice over
","This is ridiculous. At the 35 minutes mark I was waiting for 'the movie to start'. I really and honestly was waiting for the voice over to stop explaining people's motivations and connections with each other and feelings and risks and problems and desires. Jesus Christ. And even if it went away a bit after that mark, it never completely disappeared. It is the laziest trick to tell a story.If it was needed to tell the complete story in 3 hours, then this story should've been a 'two parts' or a trilogy, without any voice-over whatsoever. I can understand this in fantasy movies like Lord of the Rings, but in a gritty and realistic story? Lame.Also the miscast of De Niro. His character was annoyingly passive and nerdy. He just doesn't give that vibe. Not even close. Awful casting choice.
Also, no matter how awful your characters are, you should find a way to make them entertaining to see. Joe Pesci did that. But De Niro and Stone failed.
I was bored and annoyed by the voice over, and with time, I was bored and annoyed at the characters. I honestly couldn't care less about anything.Good 'based on a real story' movies tend to make you want to find out exactly what happened after watching them. I couldn't care less about this 'Las Vegas' incident after 'Casino'. It's not bad, but it is close.",4,2,10,13 November 2019

And oh boy, it was hard to finish!Im not a space/laser beams wars kind of movie fan anyway. So you aren't winning me over with 'special effects'. You have to have a great story and characters...

The Hangover Part III," Finally a sequel. More entertaining than funny
","In this one Phillips really gives us a sequel. The movie reflex on what happened in the prequels and the characters evolve on a dramatic level. It's funny, but it borrows a lot from the action genre. It's not a recollection of 'what happened last night?', but more about facing the consequences of what happened the last two movies. It smartly uses this to connect it with the leads' journeys, showing a coherent evolution of their personalities and their relationships. And even if it is over the top still, I believe that it all goes back to the first entry levels of plausibility, which is a good thing.The director shows his touch to let the drama sink in and make the characters more human, with realistic and more natural reactions to what is happening to them.The script is pretty good, with a reflexive first half that sets up a crazy second. It's funny throughout, but the first 40 minutes are slower and really well written, without the use of outlandish stuff. Well, except for two really lazy and outdated jokes in the first 15 minutes. Other than that, the humor is really good.Having said that, it doesn't make you fall in love like the first one, with a plot and story filled with action that makes it also a bit more generic.",7,0,2,24 December 2019
Fast Five," The longest and brainless yet! Also the best
","Finally, on 2011 they went all super-hero (or anti-hero, really).And that went well for the series because it meant less emotional/character driven scenes (there are a handful of 2 minutes 'scenes' of such kind, and while bad, they are there just to explain the motivations of the characters).The one thing that made this one better than the original is that there is a more 'Ocean's Eleven' kind of plot, and even if you do have to turn your brain off to enjoy it, it works and its more elaborated than the others of the franchise.Again, not even a bit realistic at anything, but it doesn't really try to be, in my opinion. Less races and more chases with more action improved this thing.",6,0,2,27 March 2019

How? It's not much more than a big cliché made movie!The music tells us when we are supposed to feel things. The stereotypes start and end where generally they do in these type of 'feel good movies', with the mandatory redemptive scenes for both parties, because 'of course we know' are always 'both parties fault', just to make sure nobody gets too offended.Everything is calculated, cold. No decision artistic. Everything 'acceptable' but forgettable.
Anyways. The movie is good, because it looks great, the pace is great, the music and dialogue fun and the actors good.
But still, the movie and story is so simplistic and forgettable, that is a shame this gets to be 'best of the year'.",6,0,0,7 March 2019
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," I have to be honest, it entertained me (no irony). Still, not good.
","Because the construction of scenes is occasionally pathetic, the motivation of the characters not always well done/explained (although better overall than the first two attempts), and there aren't improvements at a technical level (visually, score, editing).And yet. The true is that I can't deny I was mostly unironically entertained with both the 'teen romance story' and the supernatural aspects. Both had more coherence (not even close to perfect, but it was an improvement). The love triangle had a more than a couple of really interesting scenes (even if crazy) and I felt it was more intertwined with the overall story (in the prior movies they were kind of separated blocks). And the development of the supernatural aspects wasn't bad either (it could've been better, of course).Besides that, the acting I think it improved and everybody did the best they could to act what was on page (which lets face it, it is really hard). Even Stewart (the clearly less talented of all).
Ok movie with plenty of bad things, but it was fine.",5,0,0,4 June 2020
Click," Good idea. Totally wasted!
","Of course a great idea it was going to be wasted on Adam Sandler's hands. And its INSANE that this movie has a 6.6 score. INSANE.He has a simple message (oh boy, not really original). 'Life is great, even those little moments that you take for granted'.Ok. Now lets fill the movie with bad jokes, sappy mediocre dramatic moments, unearned emotional grow, etc. What a piece of c...p",1,0,0,17 August 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," It's even worse than the first one (which was already not good)
","One of the most boring movies I've seen that weren't low budget amateur jobs. I recognize certain flair and the good action. But every non-action second was painful. It's seems to be done on purpose. 'How can we make this scene with dialogue/exposition/story, in the most boring way possible?'Honestly, it's like art, only the opposite. I didn't think it was possible for the sequel to be worse than the already not good original. But even with a bigger budget, there is a fundamental problem with this movie and franchise. Maybe if this came out in the 80's/90's? Yeah, maybe then it could be considered good. But if every single superhero movie from any company is more matured, fun, and deep than your action flick, you have a problem.You still have some awesome action sequences, the only (bad) reasons for this 'film' to exist.",3,0,3,17 June 2019
Annihilation," Ilogical characters. Ilogical story. BUT VISUALS!?!?!?!
","So. It seems that its enough to put some fantastical visuals here and there, plus an open ending that doesn't make sense but 'it is cool' to make some get a little bit confused about the quality of a movie.This is trash. All the flaws have excuses 'we are experimenting the events by an unreliable source''the aliens aren't good nor bad and don't want anything and aren't anything but a reflection'... except when the movie needed them NOT TO BE that to make the movie more entertaining. If someone question this: 'We can't be sure if we can trust the one telling the story (unreliable)'.Nah.Besides. The movie is just absolutely boring. And the characters half dimensional and BORING.",1,2,4,17 August 2018
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Bad acting and worse casting, with sparkles of bad dialogue and mediocre story
","Tom Cruise is just not a good actor, but it was worse in a role just not for him. Brad Pitt was too young to make a boring role more than that, boring.Visually, is not that bad. It is fitting and the production value is there.But the dialogue and story are just not good. Some attempts to make the movie deep are left to die alone, between repetitive scenes of Lestat (Cruise) trying to convince Louis (Pitt) to enjoy life as 'above human' vampires. Louis, a depressed human (lost his family) choose survival as a vampire, only to realize how empty life was without love and morals (contrary to the hedonistic antagonist, Lestat, his creator and savor). But again, nothing is really explored. Sometimes, biblical, philosophical and/or poetic phrases come out of the protagonist mouths, but they are so intermittent, they just are not believable. The protagonists IQ go up and down and ideas and themes go nowhere.They missed the chance to at least make a movie about homosexuality in those times (with vampires as the oppressed), because the subtext was there anyways. The vampire that gave eternal life was looking for a companion (a beautiful men) and the man that accepted had lost his wife. But Brokeback Mountain this wasn't.Or maybe it is deeper and I just didn't get it (I won't waste time forcing myself to find meaning, like some vampires did in the movie)Regardless and above anything else, the movie is just too boring.",3,0,9,5 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Its good!
","This is a good movie.... Lets move on!(?)I mean. Considering this movie is for really young kids and the kids on adults hearts... it is really good.The dialogue is still atrocious like in all the Star Wars movies.
The 'acting' is beyong laughable.
The concepts as basic as possible for kids to comprehend (good vs evil part II)But the cinamatography is indeed awsome. And the fact that it doesn't end with the good guys winning is as bold and fantastically done as ever...So.. Yeah.. The best Star Wars.... Low bar indeed.",6,0,3,5 September 2018
Incredibles 2," A sequel from the Franchise that asks us to love the 1%
","(the better people) Smart presentation of the theme. With text and subtext. Almost everytime the movie talks about how special the superheroes are, we can replace that with the 1%.The villain of the movie shows how fake is the reasoning that the superheroes help the rest with their existence (superheroes are the 1%) and they need rules for themselves. The villain says that we (normal people) don't experience life and give up our liberties, freedom and consume the real thing from the safety of our homes, watching the screens (All true in real life, and I'm as guilty as anybody), while the 1% makes the decisions, have power and do and experience for real whatever they want. . The villain is the one that doesn't like the 1% (superheroes).While by text, the movie shows that all the superheroes (1%) want, is 'being treated fairly'. They want the rest to adapt to their exceptionalism 'for the betterment of the world' (if nobody sees the 'don't put taxes on us and we would create jobs', then what can I do? Because it is obvious to me).Besides that, the problem with this movie is that is boring. The lead character was Elastigirl this time. But they didn't go all the way. In the first one, we saw mr Incredible sad and depressed. So the scenes that weren't funny, had a lot of weight, which translated to the story rather well once it picked up the pace.
Here, Elastigirl doesn't have much of an arc. She was a bit indecisive at times, but, just in a few scenes, and it didn't impact the movie. The story was clichÃ© as eff (the dad doesn't know how to do the mommy duties, while the mom was being held back by the antiquated stereotypes of having to stay home, but she's as good or better than the dad at everything).It's so.... boring. Violet's arc was so teen angs lame. Dash didn't have an arc (not even a short one) in this one. Tooooooo much focus on the baby with a gazillion of pathetic jokes (I don't think I laugh/chuckle once in the entire movie).So yeah, the animation improved and it was great, and the action was super fun. But what made the Incredibles better than the rest just wasn't there in this one.",5,3,6,16 July 2019
Her," About the hardships of love
","We see Theodore reconcile with love after a harsh divorce from the woman of his life. We navigate a romance (ok, a weird romance with A.I.) and in that process we get to know about his failed marriage. Would he able to move on?Anyways, the acting is pretty great (Joaquin Phoenix and Amy Adams? Plus a funny small part for Chris freaking Pratt?). The voice acting for the AI is from Scarlett Johansson. I don't know. It was distracting. I didn't like it. It made it weird, because you weren't supposed to know the AI. Having an actress that wasn't well known would've worked better, in my opinion.The dialogue is great and the movie is quite beautiful when is not over Phoenix's face (not that much time).But... the first hour was a bit boring. It takes its time to a fault. And also, the movie could've used a couple more highs and lows, or a couple more complications with the technology or one more twist or something related with Theodore's past. Something else. It didn't and still was really good, just not great.",7,0,0,16 October 2019
Slumdog Millionaire," Super entertaining movie with an incredibly likeable lead
","This movie felt like they were trying to make us know all the things that happen 'normally' in India. I felt that way. So a ton of crap happens to our protagonists. Too much to be realistic.And yet is just so well done that I don't mind.
The pacing (and editing) is ridiculously good. You can't wait to see what's going to happen next.In the end. It might not be the most refined movie ever (again, way too many contrived things happen, plus too many terrible things involve the same set of characters, and the ending is...not subtle), but is well done regardless of that.",6,0,0,5 August 2018
Goodfellas," Not The Godfather
","The first 15' are a masterpiece. The good use of voice over helps to create the perfect origin story for the protagonist, remembering his childhood, while naturally dropping needed exposition for the whole story to work. It's perfect.But I have to be honest, that's kind of the peak of the movie. I just don't think Ray Liotta was good enough to make me enjoy the film, nor it was his character. And I know it was based on real life, but that didn't harm De Niro and Pesci, which were awesome.
And Lorraine Bracco tried but couldn't save another terrible and annoying female character 'written' by Scorsese (with Taxi Driver, a terrible one, with The King of Comedy, an annoying one). To be fair to Scorsese, plenty of his characters are obnoxious, so I'm not sure this is sexism. And yes, the character is based in real life, so maybe, just maybe, he was being true to life to a fault. My point: why she had to have so much screen time if that's all she was (terrible character)? It wasn't really that important to the main plot.Anyways. It is technically, a great movie. It tells a really complex and quite big story, with a brutality that is welcomed, and some scenes are beyond great (all of them involve Pesci and De Niro).But:
He overuses the voice over (it works when the film is a character study or at least when it's only one character doing it).
The insistence on making characters annoying, actually annoyed me.
And the ambivalent performance from the lead (he works well when sentimental and really poorly otherwise), plus the unnecessary large part for 'the annoying wife', all of them converge to create another flawed masterpiece.
Because 'Godfather', this ain't.",7,1,2,29 November 2019
Jurassic Park," The perfect fantasy
","In general, I dislike everything Spielberg, but his vomitive capacity to make movies full on cheap and cheesy sentimentalism, went a bit absent in this massive movie about dinosaurs. As a kid in love of them I can't deny I thank him so much for bringing dinosaurs 'to life' like never before and after in this film, without putting too much attention on the human part of the story, like Godzilla.The 'family' theme is there, but the rest is focus on the moral dilemma of humans 'playing God', creating these creatures that we would never really see, but this film brought to us as close as possible.Little to say. The story is very simple, the science quickly and fantastically explained (whether the science 'makes sense' or not, I don't really know), the escalating tension is well done, the characters believable and, like I said, the balance between plot and spectacle, just perfect.
The acting was really consistent in somewhat easy roles (except for the surprise/admiration/fear of the first encounter with 'real' dinosaurs). The score from Williams, superb. The CGI still holds up 25+ years later, and the practical effects amazing.",10,1,1,6 March 2020
Furious 7," The stupidest one of the series!
","James has an amazing talent, and he used it to create one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. Now, visually, he manages to create some beautiful shots, and some of his action sequences are really great, in the ridiculous and beyond over the top and physics kind of way the franchise turned into. But I have to blame him for making a movie that chose the easiest and dumbest turn every time something remotely interesting or surprising could've happened. And also for the atrocity of the intro, which is basically an MTV music video.But that takes me to the writing. Not untalented, because I really like how they, movie after movie, manage to connect the whole franchise. But as soon as they have to write the dialogue and exposition, they turn into the worst. This might be related to the fact that the lead actors are atrocious, but still.But that takes me to the acting. How can I only blame the writers when they can't expect even one good/decent acting scene from the cast (other than Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson). Vin Diesel's acting is regressing from a very low point. The same is happening with Michelle Rodriguez. The rest never had any potential.Whatever. The movie is terrible, it takes itself way too 90's seriously while they have cars flying in the next scene. It's a mess and a waste of James Wan.",3,0,1,29 November 2019
The Godfather," N° 2 all time
","I won't say much about this. This is perfect at every level. The level of acting/actors and the type of story it reproduces are timeless.My second favorite movie ever (as of today). The production level is perfect too, with an awesome score, costumes, etc.So yeah. Perfect movie: N° 2 of my top/11.",10,1,2,28 August 2018
