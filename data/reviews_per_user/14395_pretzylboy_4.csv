Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," More is not better
",I was disappointed in the Sherlock Holmes movie. I just felt that there was too much mindless combat. It just went on and on and that annoying fiddle. Les combat more rich textured aerials of old London or some Victorian with a gorgeous library.,5,2,5,9 August 2018
Pacific Rim," Mindless Crap.
",Garbage. Mindless crap. This is a bad movie. This movie is not good.,1,1,2,29 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Corny

Sherlock Holmes," Great Movie
",Really enjoyed the chemistry between Law and Downy. Beautifully shot with a dark edge to it. Not too much mindless combat.,8,0,1,9 August 2018
