Marie Antoinette," what was she thinking?
","I had high hopes for this film. Being a fan of fashion and shoes myself, I couldn't wait to see it. I even had to play rock-paper-scissors with my boyfriend. He wanted to see The Prestige and I, Marie Antoinette. Frankly, I wish I had lost.The movie was too thin. The only reason I knew what was going on was because I had researched Marie Antoinette before. Had you known nothing about Marie, you wouldn't have learned anything whatsoever from this film.Also, Marie pops out three kids, with there being no mention of it.Sofia Copolla did not do a good job in instilling humor in to this film. There were attempts, but very weak ones. She should've hired me.Perhaps, a brief narration throughout the film could've helped. It might've assisted those who knew nothing about the Queen.Save your money and don't watch it. I wish I could get my eight bucks back. Sofia, you owe me.",Null,4,6,28 October 2006
