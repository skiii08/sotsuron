The Ring," VERY SCARY!!! but the images they show, are so disturbing.
","I liked this movie, alot, but what they showed, when was on that tape, was so disturbing.  Not so much the tape, but the whole concept of the tape. How the person dies.  Sahara was one freaky chick.  when she comes out of the television.  The way she comes out of the well.  I was so disturbed by the images and the fact that the mother kills her daughter while saying, You'll All I Ever Wanted.  That kid who played Aiden is going to be a huge Hollywood star one day.  I usually don't get scared that easily and horror movies are kind of watered down for me, but as my sister was hiding behind a jacket, I was covering my eyes durring the freaky parts.  If you like horror and being scared, you will LOVE The Ring.",Null,0,0,25 October 2002
Bring It On," Anyone else notice that her name was Torrance, and the teams name was the Torros?
","I know its not the same word, but still, they're close.  I'm actually getting pretty sick of movies where its race against race, black vs. white. The rich white kids from the good side of town, and the poor black kids, from the rough side of town.  Plus, they make cheerleading look like a rough, tough, hard, world.  I'm against cheerleading.  Cheerleaders always get all the breaks, have high expectations for the world, and are always skinny, big chested, kind of (excuse my language) slutty, and all the guys want them.  This movie just makes the world worse.",Null,0,0,15 September 2002
A Walk to Remember," I hate this movie...I want to go back in time, and stop the person from EVER making this movie!
","I hate this movie, Mandy Moore can't act, and this movie is a disgrace to the movie world.  The over do the plot for one!  First of all, its okay they fall in love, then he has to change, then she has to have cancer, and he mom has to be dead, and they have to get married and he becomes a doctor, I have one thing to say... IF YOU ALMOST FAIL THE FIRST 3 AND A HALF YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL, YOU CANT GET GOOD ENOUGH GRADES IN A HALF A YEAR TO GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL!!!!  Its the chick flickiest of all chick flicks!",Null,1,1,24 October 2002
