Ford v Ferrari," Ford vs Ferrari it's Legendary fight ‚ù§
","Ford and Ferrari have certainly seen great competition in the history of the car race. Christian Bale (Kane Miles) and Matt Damon (Carroll Shelby) both had hard work and perseverance. Kane Miles worked hard for 24 Hours of Le Mans, great support from Shelby team and Ford company, family support. Ferrari made the mistake of underestimating the Ford company and once again proved not to judge a book by its cover.",9,1,1,11 January 2020
A Quiet Place," A Quite Place.....
","Quiet place is not really a word used in the movie, but it is a tremendous job to make people understand the whole thing. The Director and the rest of the team did a great job. While the expression of the art was difficult to reduce by the use of words, all the artisans worked hard and played a good role. As shown in Poster, Emily Blunt's (Evelyn Abbott) scene was one of the most difficult scenes in the movie. Awesome acting good directional movie.",10,1,2,11 January 2020
