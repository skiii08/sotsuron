Alien 3," see the special edition
","******Spoilers******when i first saw alien 3 i was a little disappointed but only because it was not as good as alien and aliens, i thought it was a good movie if you didn't compared it to the first two. i bought the alien box est (which if you are an alien fan i inst you bi)the box set has all films in special edition. The special edition to alien 3 is awesome it is such a better movie, it has a different creature to spawn the new alien and some other great scenes. i know think it is better then the first two.the only part of the special edition that let me down was at the end were Ripley through herself into the furnace, the alien doesn't pop out of her, that disappointed me because i always thought it was a very powerful moment but because the special edition was made in 2003 I'm assuming it was to help with the continuity with alien resurrection. The reason why this version is so great is because it includes a lot of things that David Fincher wanted but that were cut and i love David Fincher, its better because the mood and style is much stronger and more both emotional and exciting! if you are not a huge alien fan but liked them and rely want to see the special edition i would still encourage you to bi the box set for just this special edition it rely is money well spent a brilliant piece of film that sadly will be always under ratted because this special edition will not ever be theoretically released. This version is pure Fincher 10/10",10,5,9,9 June 2007
Pulp Fiction," Quentin Tarantino's Mona Licha
","one of the greatest films of all time what Quentin Tarantino has done is inspirational. although some critics have bashed the film for its graphic violence if you look at it its not that violent the scene were Bruce Willis gets the samurai sword and slashes on of the guys raping Marcellus u don't actually see the cut, you see it after but nothing as extreme as kill bill or certain films at the time. also the fact that it is said to have more swearing and or violence then his first film reservoir dogs is not true in Australia (were i live) our rating system used to have everything in levels so if something had small bit of violence as in action violence it would have low level violence if a film such as south park which has lots of swearing has high level coarse language they have this for all things except for references. my point is that reservoir dogs was classed to have high level realistic violence and cars language while pulp only had medium level violence and language",10,0,2,1 February 2007
