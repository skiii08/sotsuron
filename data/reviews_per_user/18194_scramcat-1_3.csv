Blade Runner 2049," Random fragmented sub-plots hinder a touching story about an AI's dream of becoming real
","(Starring Ana de Armas, Pinocchio Gosling, and several other stars who deserve better)While the original Blade Runner followed a group of replicants' quest for full long lives and self-realization, Blade Runner 2049 follows an AI's quest for purpose and meaning beyond her product design. Joi is a virtual domestic companion to LAPD Officer K who helps him stay grounded after a long day terminating stray replicants (he's a replicant who kills replicants, how meta). Projected as a hologram she engages K in 1950's homemaker chit-chat, joins him at the dinner table, helps him vent, and rubs his weary shoulders as best a trick of the light can. She conceptually understands the world outside the apartment's walls but accepts her isolation from it as her lot in life. When K buys Joi a portable Emitter (think the Doctor on Star Trek: Voyager) the walls fall away from her world. The most commonplace activities like embracing K in the rain or accompanying him to the food court fill her with, well, joy, and a passion to connect ever more deeply with K. She watches him ply his detective skills and survive shoot-outs with scavengers her admiration and love for him grows ever more substantial. Joi even realizes a way to share sexual intimacy with K by enlisting a flesh-and-blood body double. Now deeply realized, Joi attains a virtue shared by too few humans: Self-sacrifice. When K must go on the lam Joi volunteers to be deleted from the apartment computer console so she can't be misused by the goons hunting the man she loves. Existing only in the portable Emitter she becomes as vulnerable as him and accepts the risk as the unquestioned price of love. And when her time comes she pays that price unflinchingly.There are several meandering sub-plots that are touched on but never explored and they only waste time and raise more questions. The LAPD police captain fears the discover of a fertile replicant would tear apart society, but her fear mongering has all the authenticity of a click-bait news web site. Bioengineering tycoon Wallace yearns to build more off-world colonies but he can't make enough replicant slave labor and wants Deckard and Rachel's love child so he can learn how to build fertile replicants. Two problems there: Bred replicants would be born as infants but manufactured replicants would be fully grown and ready for the workforce. Also, Wallace was able to build another Rachel so he already has a replicant capable of giving birth, why the murder-filled quest to find the love child? The replicant underground wants the love child because they believe that replicant ability to procreate would lead to their freedom, but there's not a word mentioned of how those dots are connected. When K reunites Deckard with his long-lost daughter it turns out she's been passing as a human for 30 years, so apparently she's not a identifiable as a replicant after all. Why all the turmoil, death, and destruction to find her? The movie could have been trimmed down to a more engaging 100 minutes without all that self-defeating fluff.Joi owns the only story you'll care about.",1,20,39,12 February 2018
Hugo," Cluttered, overbearing, and bloated with its own muchness
","I didn't like the movie 'Hugo'. I can see why many people said Scorsese lost his talent.After watching it all the way through, I could see the story elements and concepts that conveyed the point of the story. And it was a good point: Life is like a complex machine whose purpose isn't necessarily obvious at any isolated moment, and how we all have a function but sometimes that function is to facilitate someone else's purpose and sometimes it's to pass our purpose onto another person. And even after a set of functions becomes apparent and a bigger purpose is accomplished, the machine keeps rolling forward and we shift into new functions for new purposes, sometimes reawakening previous purposes in a new context.Except Scorsese really f'ed it up.The movie was visually ugly. It may have worked on a big theater screen but on TV it was cluttered, overbearing, and bloated with its own muchness. Perhaps in 3D it worked but in 2D it looked gimmicky.The digital effects were heavy-handed and obvious, poorly matching grain and contrast of the film plates. Old school matte paintings on glass would have fit the period better. Gears and machinery were excessive and gratuitous, other than in the clock towers why were there insane amounts of gigantic gears inside the train station walls? And There was no harmony or flow to how the people and trains moved, for a story about the machinery of life everything should have moved like an intricate dance, instead it was a hodge-podge of random collisions.The faux red/blue Technicolor effect was gratuitous and botched. Besides being an anachronism relative to the period of the story, the lighting and contrast were all wrong. In 2-color Technicolor, did you ever see anything back-lit or with intense contrast or white glare? No, you did not. 2-color Technicolor had low to medium contrast at best, lighting was even, and white was avoided because it looked sickly.Ben Kingsley's make-up was an embarrassment. In the flashbacks to when his character Méliès was a movie maker, I couldn't tell if it was a look-alike younger actor under an ill-fitting foam latex mask or a low-res digital overlay on the real Kingsley. And that awful bulbous nose... Yes, Kingsley has a larger nose but between make-up, lighting, and camera positioning it looked like 5 pounds of foam latex covered with Spackle to eliminate every pore or other hint that it might be living flesh. And too often he was shot head-on (for 3D maybe?), making his face look like a lumpfish.Another big problem was that the Hugo character was unlikeable from the start. In the very first shot when we see him peering through the cut-out clock numbers, he looks like he has fetal alcohol syndrome, dim-witted and clueless. It's hard to shake that first impression. The only time he shows any skill or cleverness is when he fixes the broken clockwork mouse (and even then, the digital effect of the toy mouse in action is annoyingly fake). Other than that, Hugo is clumsy, obvious, and lacks any guile or finesse... the opposite of what you would think an child would become when forced to survive alone hiding in the train station walls.The story was propelled by a fragile conceit and the movie would have been over in 5 minutes if the principal characters had a lick of common sense. Imagine the former movie maker confronting Hugo at the toy shop this way:MELIES: Why do you have a notebook full of notes about my automaton? HUGO: It was my father's notebook, we were repairing the automaton together. MELIES: What? You have my automaton? Let's you and I repair it together! (roll end credits)Too many characters keep secrets that aren't secret at all, or evade answering the simplest of questions for no particular reason. I lost count of the number of times Hugo said 'You don't understand!' but never explained anything that would have made sense of his actions.So many stupid unanswered questions. Why didn't Hugo's drunkard uncle tell the station management that he had to take in his orphaned nephew? Why didn't Hugo tell the Station Master that his uncle, a station employee, had disappeared? Why did the story make it seem as if Hugo had been alone for years when, as we find out later, it was only 2 months? Why didn't the station management notice when the uncle didn't collect his pay for 2 months? Why was Hugo so secretive about the automaton when all he had to say was that it was special to his father and he wanted to keep that memory? Why did the girl refuse to tell Hugo where she got the heart-shaped key? Why did the Méliès' wife freak out over the automaton's drawing and give Hugo the bum's rush when all she had to do was say that it would have brought back painful memories for her husband? Why was it so easy for the wife to say just that after the film historian flattered her looks? Why would a giant glass clock face in a high tower have hinged panes just big enough for a child to squirm through? Why didn't Hugo bring the automaton along with the film historian and the projector when they all visited Méliès' home? Why did no one give Hugo a decent meal or at least a healthy snack?I could go on all day.The elements of a very good movie were in there amongst the nonsensical vanity, but the script, director, and designer ruined it. I look forward to the black-and-white real film remake in 10 years by someone who understands that style must never overshadow substance.",3,2,4,29 December 2013
Brave," Mediocre and strictly by the Disney rule book
","I suffered through the endless parade of BRAVE trailers for months. So many months. I began to feel the movie had already come and gone. And the trailers told me the single most important thing about this movie: Pixar hired a crack team of PhD mathematicians, created 5 new fields of modeling mathematics, and bought 27 BlueGene supercomputers just to render the girl's hair.The hair bounces. The hair swings. The hair toussles. The hair drops stray locks here and there. The hair compacts. The hair billows. The hair responds to the wind. The hair responds to momentum and interia. The hair responds to humidity. The hair reflects every known shade or 'firey lass' red along with previously unknown shades the computers postulated and shades the human mind cannot grasp.And the hair is wrapped around a familiar, mediocre, largely predictable story that you've seen several times before in several other 'girls can do anything boys can do' movies and TV sitcom episodes.Don't let Pixar's technical expertise and visual humor distract you from the cold hard truth that the underlying story is pretty pale. The visual styling is dazzling and inspiring, the attention to detail is mind-boggling. Pixar makes unprecedented use of technology to create a previously unseen richness of environment.Which may explain why they had no energy left to craft a story you'd want to sit through.You've seen each fundamental step of the story anywhere from a million to infinity-minus-one times before. Puberty-straddling girl wants to be a free spirit. Girl complains that NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HER. Girl uses various tricks and ruses to try to demonstrate she's capable but only demonstrates that she's impatient and devious. Girl resorts to a dirty trick to manipulate parents who JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HER. The dirty trick back-fires and girl spends most of the rest of the movie trying to undo the harm she caused and mistakenly comes to the conclusion that cleaning up her mess proves she's as cool as she thought she was, and isn't a stubborn, willful, spiteful, selfish, manipulative, deceitful, self-absorbed little bitch, not even a little.Remind you of an episode of 'That's So Raven'? See BRAVE at a second-run dollar cinema. Or wait and see it on NetFlix.",4,293,555,22 June 2012
