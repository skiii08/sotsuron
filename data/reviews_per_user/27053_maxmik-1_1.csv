The Hangover," Not that great but pretty funny
","This movie made me laugh even at times when I didn't fully understand why. So for that I am grateful & got my money's worth. I look forward to the DVD with its deleted scenes etc. The central trio of the movie are such a sad sack bunch of losers they really look funny without having to say or do anything. I also appreciated some of the supporting characters: Heather Graham who deserves better parts, the Asian dude who sparked up events, & even Mike Tyson who I normally would not like at all. Plus the baby Carlos who was so cute.I liked the ending especially with the series of photographs which goes a long way to explain what happened.",8,0,2,10 July 2009
