It," IT was brilliant but not a horror its more a comedy
","this movie was brilliant really enjoyed it, although I thought it would be a horror movie it was more of a comedy, we laughed almost all the way through. Its well worth a watch the acting is superb and I found it to be much better than the first movie, just a shame it weren't scary as we thought it would be, overall id give a 9 out of 10 but think the rating should be a PG :)",Null,11,20,10 September 2017
