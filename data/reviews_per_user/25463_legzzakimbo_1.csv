The Ring," Brilliant, best remake made, doesn't disappoint!
","Tightened script, extraordinary use of visual story telling methods, and well cast actors make this version of The Ring a feast for horror fans. All the gimics of the genre are incorporated, while the suspence of the Japanese original remains intact. Many of the original sequences are reborn and enhanced, and along with this rehashed script, are not dumbed down in anticipation of Hollywood audience prerequisites. The idea of Sadako/Samara is fantastic. Perhaps the main difference in feeling from the original lies with our perception of her: In the original one understands Sadako to be non-human, supernatural, and a product of some ancient sea torment. The Ring (2002) however, portrays Samara as a fundementally evil entity out for revenge. All in all this was an excellent film, a tribute to the first, which adds its own original concepts and visual artistry.",9,1,1,25 March 2003
