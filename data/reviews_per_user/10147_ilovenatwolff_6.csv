Hereditary," I liked it but the ending ruined it
",I watched the movie and thoroughly enjoyed it even though it got a bit confusing and long winded. I really liked the scenes with Alex Wolff going crazy and having hallucinations. The ending ruined that impression. A cult?! Really? You had an amazing set up for a paranormal explanation but you chose a cult? Ugh. Pathetic and just plain laughable.,4,0,4,29 August 2018
Deadpool 2," Actually funny
","I started the movie a little skeptical thinking it couldn't live up to the first one, which was a masterpiece. Then right in the beginning of the movie something seriously sad and uncalled for happens, which I'm still a little mad about. However I actually did make me laugh and it made my boyfriend laugh hysterical. Plenty of physical comedy.",7,1,3,29 August 2018
Ready Player One," The greatest film I have ever seen
",The visuals had me floored. It was spectacular. The story was entertaining throughout. It had me genuinely feeling so many emotions. 30 minutes in I felt like it was an instant classic. It didn't let me down after that initial impression.,10,1,3,20 June 2018
Get Out," Excellent movie
","This movie is really good, definitely worth rewatching. It does a good job of surprising you with the ending. It was scary in ways that weren't over done, did not rely on jump scares and other crap but more on amazing acting and chilling scenes that were done with just enough drama. The ratings on this movie are good for a reason.",9,1,5,29 August 2018
A Quiet Place," Enjoyed great suspense
",I enjoyed this movie. They did a really great job of building suspense. It was scary. Perhaps the best part of the movie was the use of sound. It's quiet for the most part but it really gets you to appreciate small noises like footsteps and wind and corn stalks hitting each other. Its beautifully done.,8,1,3,29 August 2018
Deadpool," Pleasantly surprised
",Let me preface by saying I hate superhero movies. I loved this movie. It was hilarious and fun to watch. Definitely recommend. It's not a corny superhero story at all,8,1,2,10 September 2018
