Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Really boring 2 hours and 16 minutes
","I think Kill Bill vol.1 is the best movie of all time for me, on the other hand the sequel is really awful. It's so boring and there is no action, everything is predictable. Bill is boring as hell and he just can't shut up, talks nonsense through the whole movie. There is no single interesting character, the teacher of Uma Thurman was not funny at all and also was boring. I think everything would be great if it was only Kill Bill 1, even though Bill is not shown, audience can imagine their whole life what happened, and not see this awful movie. All the scenes are far too long and mostly don't make any sense at all. So to warn you guys , PLS don't see this movie.",2,1,4,13 June 2015
