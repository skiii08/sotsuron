Your Name.," Great Animations
","The animation in this movie was absolutely amazing ! Even though people may discount the movie since it's animated but I really recommended everyone to watch. Some parts were humorous, other parts mysterious but the connection that forms is so beautiful and unreal. You really end up embarking on the journey with the characters to discover these beautiful scenery and unravelling truths, it's astounding!",8,9,14,6 April 2017
Split," Overrated
","Not too sure why this title was so highly rated. The synopsis really captivated me and I believe the potential of the movie was vast however, Split did not perform up to my expectations. The movie lacks substance and builds towards a supernatural ending of gore and violence.I like how the theme of abused is being highlighted, yet the movie does very little to build upon it. The possibility of humans having multiple personalities to enhance themselves is a fascinating topic but yet again, the movie did not portray it in a good light.",3,157,366,11 March 2017
