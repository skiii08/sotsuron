Hereditary," AWFUL
","Worst scary movie I have ever seen in my life, the dad gets deep fried by a freaking book, mom won't stop banging her head to the damn ceiling for no reason, the son looks like he's on hella meth and other drugs... and omg the ending was worst than them all... like ain't nobody wants to see bunch of naked 70 years old males... -1/10 don't ever watch it, it's so bad.",Null,1,4,27 June 2018
