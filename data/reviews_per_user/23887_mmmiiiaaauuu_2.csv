Blade Runner 2049," Absolutly brilliant!
","So Before you take in count other reviews claming it has way to many 'plot holes', consider this, you may not have ever watched the first movie, and still be able to get the story, but if you are craving for knowing what happened in the years between the first and new movie, then there are 3 shortstorys that you can find almos anywhere, made by different artists and comisioned by the director Denise Villeneuve, it covers some important facts between the first and this movie, itÂ´s hard to cover every single detail in a movie (it should have been made a series)
So go, watch it!
P.S. the leitmotiv created by Hans Zimmer is absolutly amazing it could be another character.",10,3,10,13 March 2018
Annihilation," If you enjoy science philosophy... go ahead
","So, this is a movie that I enjoyed from the point of philosophy, it´s a bit like prometeus, if you focus on the theory and possible situation, it´s enjoyable, BUT... if you are looking for some great fight scenes, bang bang bang, nudes, and the clichés that usually come with hollywood movies....well, this is not for you.",7,17,36,17 March 2018
