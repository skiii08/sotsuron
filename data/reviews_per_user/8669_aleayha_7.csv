The Blair Witch Project," Horrror-Ible
","I honestly believe that what set this film apart was the low budget and raw material that was used. The idea was honestly great, but it simply didnt deliever. As I patiently waited for the movie to get 'scary' I become increasingly annoyed at Heathers constant belittlement of her counterparts, and her profane mouth. I must say that for a spell I wished to be one of the characters so that I could push Heather off that log and run...run...run....(so I suppose it at the very least got my creative mind working)Anyway, it seems as though the movie is finally getting to those freaky moments that I had heard so much about and then 3 minutes later, ITS OVER. Wow did I feel cheated and gullable.....oh well at least I got out of the house for a wopping hour and twenty minutes.",2,0,1,4 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Please dont waste your time or money
",This movie was weak!!!!! I was so disappointed. I dont normally concede to Hollywood hype but found myself totally caught up in the frenzy. If the movie delivered the same punch the last 5 minutes did I probably would have a different opinion.I think everyone in the theatre felt at least a little jilted judging by the groans when the lights flickered on.,2,0,2,1 August 1999
The Ring," kind of.......lame.
","Well , I cant agree with the general enthusiasim that surrounds this film. What began as a promising story ended up as nothing more than an over rated wanna- be psychological thriller. The film within the film was the best part of the movie. I would like to see the Japanese original, myself.If you want to see a better movie that will creep you out more, then see M Night Shamalans thriller Signs. It is far superior in every way.",5,0,0,12 November 2002
Malcolm X," VERY important film
","Everyone should watch this movie. I never realized what an important person Malcolm X was to every race. I assumed that he was an icon to the black community ONLY.I attended high school in the early 80's and we never studied Malcolm x, so my thoughts and opinions on him where way off. I feel very enlightened and am better for having seen this film. Denzel Washington is fabulous as usual.",7,3,10,12 December 2000
Resident Evil," fun!!!
","If you go to see resident evil- go and see it because you want to have fun. Don't take it too seriously. It has some good special effects and quite a few moments that will make you jump- if not scream.
  My husband and I took my teenage son, and I was pretty skeptical about liking it. But really,- when is the last time you went to the theatre to see a zombie flick? It brought back memories!This movie is NOT for the pre teen or younger set- a young mother chose to bring her little girl- probably 4 or 5 years old - and the child was very frightened. The R rating is appropriate and parents should be aware.    The down note of the film is Michelle Rodreguiz's performance. She tried too hard to be tough- I found it annoying. The rest of the cast was pretty good.
 Go ahead and see the movie- if you liked the video game, or just want to see a good zombie flick.",6,0,0,17 March 2002
Life Is Beautiful," A beautiful love story
","What a wonderful story.This movie fulfilled all that it set out to do...leave people awestruck at the power of love, imagination,sacrifice and the human spirit. I never once thought that the movie was intended to make light light of the holocaust but rather that its primary focus was on that of a beautiful love story. To those who seemingly missed the violence: I think as adults we all well know what happened to the people in the showers, the elderly, the very young and those who had 'doctors appointments' during the holocaust , it was not necessary to see it , it was felt. By leaving those scenes out my  11 year old son was able to watch this movie and love it too. He asked a lot of questions and actually  desired the knowledge of the events that took place. I sincerely believe that it was made perfectly.",10,1,2,28 January 2000
Pulp Fiction," nothing special
","I am with the minority who thought this film was overhyped. I thought it mediocre at best (although the diner scene was cool).If this is a masterpiece , I fear cinema is going to hell in a handbasket. Casino was ten times the movie Pulp Fiction is.",5,2,6,4 October 2000
