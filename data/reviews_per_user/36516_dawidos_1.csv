The Ring," how the hell could one spare himself???
","Please, I am from faraway, so soory for my English:-), i have just seen the Ring. So: How could one survive? You had to copy the cassette and then you had to give it to somebody to see?? And then you survive? I dont understand. If it was in this way, then the mother had had to give it to somebody else to see and then he would die!",Null,0,1,4 March 2003
