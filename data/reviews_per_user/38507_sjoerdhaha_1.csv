It," .
",It is a very good movie and one of the best horror movies I've probably seen. It Has in comparison to a lot of other horror movies a really good story line. Also the characters are played with a lot of emotion so you can feel compassion with them.The only downsite for me was that some of the 'scary' moments in the film were a little far-fetched. In the end. If you like horror movies It is a real must see.,7,4,8,24 September 2017
