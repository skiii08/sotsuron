The Blair Witch Project," A thought from a 'Blair' resident
","Having grown up on that mountain less than a mile from Burkittsville, MD, The only impact this movie - and I use the term loosely - had on me was how I really should go invest in a video camera. Flick very poorly and cheaply done without benefit of any actual research on the history and folklore of the area, Strategy, excellent. A lot of bucks made for spending just enough in productions to peak curiosity. Kudos, wish I'da thought of it. And I may yet do a similar one, made just as cheaply, but based on the stories and lore about restless spirits left over from the atrocities that really happened, and happened there. Not in Seneca Creek or Patapsco State Parks, safely just outside of Baltimore where this was filmed. Blair witch, bull. That was just the rantings of one scared individual in an attempt to avoid being executed for assisting in the murder of kids 65 years ago, and the really sick one behind it was one of the kids. If you're really interested in actual events or the history beyond the twisted fairy tales, look it up for yourself. But if you're not from around there, the spirits don't know you and you shouldn't be there, hanging out at night, treading on grounds that have become sacred to them, that contain their remains. Grounds that you have no respect for. Stay in town where you belong. The truth runs much farther back and is not just a lot stranger than fiction - it's much more terrifying.",1,1,3,15 April 2005
