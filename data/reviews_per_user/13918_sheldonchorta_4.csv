Despicable Me 2," Was this a different movie?!
","I have a feeling that this movie was gonna be the minions movie before they decided to make a sequel instead. That's what I'm gonna question first: WHY ARE MINIONS FUNNY?! Slapstick IS funny, but when you won't laugh when you see that as an entire movie! That's why the Home Alone sequels didn't work, so why are the creators of this movie getting a pass? And the minions' comedy is just that: slapstick overload! So, now that that is out of the way, let's talk about something else. GRU IS BLAND AS HELL!!! Whenever I hear him talk, I hear a bored, uninterested Steve Carrel waiting for his paycheck. And he only cares about himself until someone he knows is in trouble. And the girls! My GOD is this a waste of Miranda Cosgrove! She is a good actress and she was even very good in the first Despicable Me, but she just SUCKS here. The smallest one is a boring character, and I don't remember ONE LINE OF DIALOGUE from the middle child. I would go on and on about all the other characters, but I won't. And the plot just plain up SUCKS!!! Again, it feels like a Minions movie that needed a plot to have a sequel to the first film. It feels slow and boring, and I'm convinced that the script writers were high while writing such inane dialogue, comedy, and characters!!! NEVER WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! EVER!!!!!!",2,1,2,3 July 2015
Independence Day," Meh
","Though this movie does have problems, they are not major and don't really matter. This is because the movie distracts you from the stupidity quite well. For Example, the effects in this movie are great! The aliens are original and the explosions are quite believable, even if they are CGI. The plot is just another alien takeover. Just think of War of the Worlds meets Top Gun. The characters are OK. That's the nicest things to say about them. Jeff Goldblum plays JEFF GOLDBLUM! That's it. The only actor who's trying is Will Smith, but he makes everything he's in awesome! The movie is just OK. The movie is silly, but harmless. It has plot holes, but the action distracts you from them. The movie's stupid, but it is so hilarious in its stupidity. So, yeah. I have a spot in my heart for cheesy blockbusters. And this movie is no exception. Have a happy Independence Day, and watch Independence Day!!!",6,0,0,4 July 2015
Jaws," You're gonna need a bigger boat...
","If you ask me, there are only a hand full of movies that I can call 'perfect', and this is one of them! Jaws tells the story of Martin Brody, the Chief of Police on the quiet island of Amity, and how his life was changed forever one fateful summer. It all starts with the mysterious death of a skinny dipper, soon found in pieces on the shore. Believing it to be a shark attack, Brody attempts to close the beaches, but this upsets the mayor of Amiry Island, who's main goal is to make money off the tourists coming to the island. Things become worse when a little boy is also killed by the same shark, putting fear and anxiety in the hearts of Amity's people. Trying to find a way to stop this shark before he strikes again, he teams up with Matt Hooper, an oceanographer hired to find out more about the shark and how it works, and Quint, a war vet with a terrifying past and a vast amount of sea shanties to sing as he hunts down this great white. Will they find and kill the shark? Or will they be the latest thing on its menu?First thing to comment on, of course, is the story. No other person on this Earth could write a more realistic, terrifying, and classic story like this! The movie is based on the book written by Peter Benchley, so he is given the praise for making one of the best stories ever put on paper and screen! Next up, the acting. Jaws gave us the best performances from Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider, and, most of all, Robert Shaw as Quint. His performance has sent chills doe the spines of many, and those chills never stop. Next, the score. It's John Williams. That's all I need to say. Up next, the effects. This is the only negative part of this movie. The effects are not the greatest, and especially considering the budget of the film, which I calculated as over $35,000,000, it's a wonder how this shark looked so strange. However, you have to admit that it was a good idea to keep the mechanical shark hidden until the final third. The shark may look odd, but it still scares the crap out of me to this day. Finally, the cinematography. The film is very beautiful and you can see that by just looking at the multiple screenshots. It's dark and disturbing when it needs to be, as well as nice and pretty when it needs to. Really, this review can't do this movie justice. All I have to say is watch this movie. Just don't watch it before going to the beach. You never know what could be down there...",10,2,4,1 August 2016
The Croods," The Peter Jackson's Avatar of kids movies in the worst ways possible.
","How can anyone like this pile of uneducated garbage!!! I think people are just too blown away by the animation ( which is this movies only strong point. Seriously, this is Dreamworks' greatest animation since How to Train Your Dragons!) that they don't notice that it is literally a movie done a million times!!! Yes folks, this is the 'paranoid parent doesn't want to let his daughter go/ road trip' movie. Nicholas Cage is OK in this movie, but all I hear is Nic Cage being NIC CAGE! Emma Stone is also a good actress, but I can't say that this is the best film of her career. That being said, it's not the worst film she has been in either. But I'm getting ahead of myself. The one thing that this movie is is UNGODLY FORGETTABLE!!! I can't remember ONE LINE OF DIALOGUE and the comedy is too much slapstick and not a lot of anything else, that the jokes are just as forgettable as the dialogue. Quite literally, this movie is THE AVATAR OF ANIMATED BOX OFFICE MOVIES. It has good actors that don't do as good in the movie as they should, like Avatar. It's visual style is much more memorable than the actual plot, like Avatar. The story is a mix of clichés, like Avatar! It's just Avatar made for kids! Unless you want to see a movie to riff and make fun of, or if you want to see Avatar 2 before they release it in theaters, I wouldn't touch this movie at all!!!",1,2,7,3 July 2015
