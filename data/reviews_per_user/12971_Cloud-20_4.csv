The Blair Witch Project," Brilliant movie, but not as scary as I thought it was going to be
","*Contains Spoilers*I went to go see Blair Witch project this past week. I've heard mixed reviews about it. Some people say it was 'Scary as hell.' I've heard other people say 'This movie is horrible.' I decided to go see it and make my own decision.  A friend and I went to a Matinee, there was about 4 or 5 other people in the theater. Throughout the 90's we've been exposed to some of the most god awful horror movies of our time, but this was a definent change of pace. This movie is a lot better than any horror I've seen in a long time. It doesn't take special fx to scare people, and this movie proves that. I really liked Blair Witch Project, but it didn't scare me much. The last 10mins or so was the only scary part of the movie. The final images in this movie will be in your head for days. Other than the last bit, I wasn't terribly frightened as some people have been. It was more of a thriller.  No one is going to enjoy this film if they didn't pay attention at the beginning when they were interviewing the towns people. If you didn't listen to the conversations you wouldn't understand what was going on in the woods (the piles of rocks, etc). The stupidist people in the world were sitting in front of me during this movie. Halfway through the movie when they come back to the same log they were at eariler, a person in front of us asked, 'Why is she crying? Is that the same log.'   This is a good movie and if your a fan of the horror genre go out and see this, but don't expect to be too terrified.",Null,1,1,1 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awesome
","I went out and saw The Phantom Menace opening night and I wasn't dissapointed. I thought this was a great film. The Critics and fans alike who dislike this film all hate it for the wrong reasons. Fans have spent the last 16 years fantasing about what the new Starwars movie is going to be like. If it wasn't the way they thought it was going to be they didn't like it. I was happy to hear that Roger Ebert gave the film a good review.I enjoyed every part of this movie, even Jar Jar Binks who so many people love to hate. The acting was good with the exception of Jake Lloyd who I felt was a bit too cutsey and overacted his role a bit to much. I do give him credit though since he is young and I don't think anyone else could've done a much better job. Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor all gave outstanding performances along with all the other actors in this movie.Another great aspect of this film was the lightsaber duel between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Obi-Wan Kenobi. That whole scene was incredible and the music fit perfectly with the scene.I've seen this movie 4 times and I plan to see it again. If your a fan of Starwars just ignore the critics and the fans who bash this film. It's a fantastic movie that fits in well with all the other Starwars movies. You won't be dissapointed.",10,0,0,1 August 1999
Akira," Great movie
","When I sat down and watched Akira for the first time about four years ago I didn't like the movie that much. I liked the action but I found the story complicated and the movie was overly bloody. It was my intention to forget this film and never watch it again. A couple months after the first time I watched it I rented it again at a friends house. I started to enjoy the film more. Today this is one of my favourite movies. The main reason I started to like this movie so much is because in time I began to understand the plot more and therefore the movie was more enjoyable. I find that most of the people who hate Akira don't understand the story and don't like the violence and blood. Recently I rented Akira again. I told my friend about it and he said he wanted to watch it with me. I warned him about the blood and that didn't seem to bother him. I also told him that the plot is very difficult to understand. After the movie I asked him what he thought of it. His response was 'What in the hell was going on in that movie?' He didn't really care for the movie but again the main reason was not being able to understand the plot. I think Akira is a great movie but it takes an open mind to enjoy it. Be prepared, the plot is very complex and it might take you a while to fully comprehend it. As I mentioned there is a lot of blood in this movie but if that doesn't bother you then give Akira a try you won't regret it.",10,0,1,21 July 1999
Pitch Black," This movie is terrible!
","My God, talk about a waste of time. This has got to be one of the worst, most friggen corny movies I've seen in my life. From the opening scenes I was left yawning. The only reason I stayed in the whole time was my buddy seemed to be enjoying it, but after it was all said and done, he ended up hating it as well. And talk about the worst plot twists. I won't give anything away, but to those that have seen it, do you recall the part where Riddick or whatever his name is, says to stop the girl from bleeding? C'mon, how could anyone have found that part the least bit interesting. The whole theatre let of this disgusted groan. This was a pure waste of time. Please, do yourself a favor and don't go!",Null,0,0,11 March 2000
