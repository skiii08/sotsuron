Blade Runner 2049," Fan fiction with a giant budget
","There are many flaws with 2049, but none bigger than its fan fiction level plotting. What if Deckard and Rachel somehow had open ended lifespans and they had a baby! It's amateur hour stuff. It treads all over the world created in the masterpiece original. You'd have thought Tyrell might have at least dropped a hint that as well as planting experimental memories in Rachel, he also gave her the ability to have children. The cast is bored throughout. Gosling is flat as ever and mumbles every line. Ford does his usual grumpy old man act. Robin Wright is good for the brief handful of scenes she's in. Sylvia Hoeks is serviceable as a female Terminator. Ana De Armas is one note and her thick accent makes her dialogue difficult to understand. Jared Leto appears to be stoned throughout and is barely audible as his James Bond comedy villain. Visually 2049 has its moments, but they're sandwiched inbetween a lot of daytime sequences which are flat, grey, and foggy. Even the nighttime sequences lack the detail and scale of the original, and the interiors frankly look like they belong in 2001 rather than Blade Runner. The original is a much, much better looking movie. The score is a stand out as it may well be the worst score in motion picture history. Hans Zimmer has taken his war on melody to new levels with this cacophonous wall of random noise. It's painful stuff. He steals a classic Vangelis melody at the end, which only compounds his failure. The day Zimmer retires from film scoring will be a happy day. The film is not entirely without merit. It's nice to see spinners again and some of the nighttime city shots are nice, but that's about it. The original remains a perfect movie. This is anything but. And why does Deckard's daughter have a French accent? Just one of the many baffling decisions in this cinematic mess.",3,3,5,18 March 2018
Pacific Rim," Del Toro has fallen very, very far
","'From the director of Pan's Labyrinth'! Apparently. Not that you would know after watching this utterly derivative and mind numbingly awful film. It's essentially Godzilla meets Evangelion, but with none of the fun of the first, and none of the character development and drama of the second. Instead we get characters which are either bland and generic, or just hateful and moronic. The only exception is Rinko Kikuchi's character, but she can't save this mess of a movie. There are several comic relief characters too, who are all immensely annoying.The CG is nice enough, as is standard now, although the sets look like they've fallen out of a mid 1990s Godzilla film, which is to say, they look incredibly cheap and tacky. Maybe that's the idea, who knows.Del Toro is a director who has proved he can make hugely imaginative, original, and beautiful works. Sadly Pacific Rim also proves that he's equally capable of making utter dross. Please Guillermo, go back to Spain and start making movies again, instead of intros to Sega Saturn games.",2,3,5,25 January 2014
Prometheus," A pointless prequel
","The story in Prometheus simply makes no sense, is full of plot holes, and is the type of anti-science rubbish one would expect from a hack like Lindelof. All it really manages to do, is take a nice little mystery from the first film, - the space jockey - and turn it into something absurd, ridiculous, and unimaginative. The characters are also uninteresting in the extreme, with only Michael Fassbender, playing the same role as Ian Holm and Lance Henricksen did in the first two movies, managing to stand out. Particularly disappointing is Noomi Rapace who sadly isn't shining now she's away from her native Sweden.Prometheus, if nothing else, proves that prequels are pointless and tell stories which need not be told. It doesn't reach Phantom Menace level of awfulness, but it's alarmingly close at times. Ridley, it's time to retire, before you trample over Blade Runner too.",3,3,9,4 June 2012
Back to the Future Part II," Not even 10% of the original's genius
","The original Back to the Future is a perfect movie. Brilliantly written, paced, acted, directed, and edited. There's never a dull moment, the story is great from start to finish, and the fantastical elements are never so far fetched as to break the suspension of disbelief.Not so with the sequel.Taken as a stand alone film, it's complex, very silly, but still entertaining. However, taken as a sequel to such a masterpiece, it's a borderline mess. The story is all over the place, needlessly complex, and incredibly silly. Michael J Fox plays himself and his kids in multiple ways, rendering several scenes as little more than ridiculous farce. The lack of the brilliant Crispin Glover as George McFly is obvious throughout too, with the various out of focus stand ins looking just awful. The movie also fails to build to any sort of climax, with it feeling throughout like a collection of random, often bizarre and unrelated sequences which seem to exist purely to show off prosthetic or split camera effects. Compared to the perfect storytelling and character arcs of the original, it's truly staggering that this script ever got approved.If for some reason you've never seen the Back to the Future films, just see the first and skip the awful sequels.",4,12,23,3 January 2011
