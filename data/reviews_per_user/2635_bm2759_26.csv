Sucker Punch," A good-looking but crap film
","I saw this movie for the first time last night. The story is quite a good choice especially given the focus upon female vulnerability and sexism. Whilst clever it is in my opinion executed poorly.The action sequences are quite enjoyable and entertaining. And also clever as a metaphor. But the dazzle and flair used to thrill the audience with ass-kicking heroines is the only good point of this film. Overall the strangest part of the film is the end credits where the cast performs on stage in a musical. It completely undermines the seriousness, sadness and flinching hope the film attempts to convey (and fails).",4,1,8,24 May 2013
Gravity," Truly amazing
","Believe the hype this is an amazing film. It truly is. You may have seen survival films before but not like this. Go see it now.Unlike many films set in space this focuses on realism. You'll find no aliens in this film, no laser guns and no space battles. Instead this shows us a snap shot of how astronauts working in space, notably the difficulty in operating in a completely hostile environment.Many people will watch this film and love this visuals especially if seen in 3D. Whilst I agree it looks great in 3D seeing this in 2D would still be impressive. But even if the visuals weren't impressive this would still be a very memorable film.I was mostly impressed with how space is presented; not as a beautiful, magical area with endless wonder, exploration and potential for adventure (like sailing the seven seas). But instead space is shown to be an environment where the slightest thing changing or going wrong results in death or the threat of death. Even with high degrees of safety and training we cannot control this environment. And the physics which applies to space I've had a concept of but never seen just how different it is to Earth is shown to be a danger itself. WOW.Onto the characters. There is only two of them. And both do a great job with George Clooney easily portraying the calm, experienced astronaut; Sandra Bullock portraying the technical proficient and capable yet flawed and inexperienced astronaut. Well done to both of them for giving a very memorable performance.Lastly I want to praise the running time of the film. Too often I see movies which run long because it is seen as best practice. The result is a drawn out story which can loose audience interest and therefore fail to entertain us. At 91 minutes long it absolutely captives you from start to finish. I would rather see a very concisely told story that is only 1.5 hours long than sit through a so-called 3 hour epic which is uninteresting, unnecessarily long and not entertaining in segments (e.g. The Hobbit).Go see the film of 2013 today.",10,9,23,25 November 2013
World War Z," Average action film
","First off I wish to say having see this film then going home and playing Left 4 Dead 2 made it more enjoyable. That game is awesome already.But anyway yes this is not faithful to the source material. However I'm judging this as a film alone and not comparing it to the source material.Overall World War Z is an average movie. It doesn't deserve a 0 and definitely is not a 10 film either. The positive aspects are offset by the negative aspects. I left the cinema neither happy nor sad.Pros: good special effects, great scope of destruction, surprisingly good suspense.Cons: uninteresting characters, muse's repetitive use of one song to evoke emotion, plot holes, silly implausible ending.If you are really interested in seeing this film maybe you might enjoy it more than me. But don't expect too much",5,1,3,11 July 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Good follow up
","As a scfi fan quite excited to see this film I unfortunately left disappoint a little. JJ Abrams said this is a stand-alone film where the audience does not need to have seen prior Star Trek films to enjoy. This is true to a certain extent where you realise it references and reuses much Star Trek history. I thought this is a good and bad aspect of the film. The reason is because whilst it is unoriginal to a degree it enables old fans to be acknowledged and new fans to enjoy the film. Old fans might also see the crew, besides Kirk and Spock, have minimal screen time. I was also disappointed with this because they almost disappeared. However those who know the history of this franchise will enjoy it more because of these references to past star trek works.From the beginning of the film action occurs regularly and at varied scales. Any fan of action films will be awed by the large set piece sequences unfolding before them with satisfying SFX, great art designs, and sound. Visuals clearly are one of the strong aspects that most, including me, immediately are impressed by (especially the warp battle scene). Also seeing a futuristic Earth is great and I really wanted to see more of it than we did however what you do see is great.Acting from all was just fine. Not one line of dialogue was out of place.The story itself is good but as said earlier reuses and references too much Star Trek history to be praised for originality. I know this is an alternative universe where events only up to a certain point are changed but the reasons for everything that occurs is largely one persons imagination, i.e. we don't see events which generate the supposedly perpetuated fear. I believe that 'Into Darkness' is an incorrectly chosen title because there isn't much darkness in this film.In critiquing the story think the antagonist's action are too extreme for what he aims to achieve; he is experienced in war, has a calm demeanour, is methodical and is strategic. Somehow despite his motivations for his actions the collateral damage incurred doesn't fit. This makes no sense to me because we find out who his target is all along. If he is very skilled and capable then why kill so many others when one person is your target. Friends have said 'he is a complex bad guy' whereas my impression is his character doesn't match his actions.You shouldn't be surprised that with little screen time the crew of the Enterprise hardly develop as characters, except for Sulu, Kirk and Spock. They do get their screen time but we see no growth or change in the characters. Hence the crew become backdrops to transport Kirk and Spock around to have a swash-buckling adventure.If you are interested in seeing this film please do. You will be entertained and escape from reality for a few hours. Whilst you will have some enjoyment you might leave a little disappointed like I did. The reason is because the story reuses and references too much past material, the antagonist's character and actions are a mis-fit; and the Enterprise crew (besides Kirk and Spock) are minor characters.",7,4,9,30 May 2013
The Book Thief," Refreshing choice of narration and authentic replication
","To my surprise this was a nice film which covered a lot of emotional content and giving us a fictional yet believable story of ordinary people in Germany during WW2.Credit goes to the use of death as the narrator of Liesel's story which was refreshingly different. It enabled the story to be presented in a more pleasant and child-like manner than a typical tragedy of suffering.One further positive is the effort taken to replicate a believable Stuttgart. Characters spoke realistic sounding German, English with a German accent or a mixture of both. Very few films enable the audience to understand another language whilst also telling a story in their own language. Also the use of real propaganda like posters, school choir songs, outfits, living conditions and public atmosphere all benefit the film and allow us to appreciate it better.Each of the 5 main characters are all very well acted. Geoffrey Rush nails a caring yet slightly silly father beautifully as does Emma Watson as the tough mother with a big, yet hidden, heart. The standout is Sophie Nélisse as Liesle portraying wonder, innocence, joy, sadness, or empathy with us ease; they definitely chose the correct actress. Nico Liersch as Rudy was solid as light-hearted, joyful best friend of Liesel. Ben Schnetzer as Max portrayed a Jew in hiding we've not seen before, i.e. confident, understanding and caring towards those who are keeping him alive, without being frightened , tormented or helpless.My main criticisms are:* Mama coming to school to give Liesel good news - why do that and risk being exposed when such news can be delivered at home? * Bodies of those who died from their homes being bombed looking like people asleep. Surely if the filmmakers go to the effort of having vocal coaches for realistic German accents, then why not also give us authentic looking corpses. * Max appearing at the end. Where did he go and how did we survive? Not even some dialogue to explain how or why? His appearance lacks any impact upon the audience and lines up too nicely to be believable, i.e. cheap. * The film skips from sometime in 1943 to 1945 when Americans arrive in Stuttgart. What happened to Liesel in that time? The most interesting part of her story is what happened to her after the town was severely bombed. * The last 5 minutes of the film was quite rushed where it seemed to hurry up and finish the story without giving many details. I wanted to see a little more of what happens to the characters. * The ending is beautiful and a positive. However why can't we see how she ended up in Manhattan, New York. And why New York? Of all the places she would have emigrated to surely choosing New York was too clichéd. I suspect it was chosen because many Europeans emigrated to the USA and New York is likely where they arrive. Despite being an open-minded and multicultural city it is unrealistic she'd remain there her whole life.A few small grievances aside this is a film I'd recommend to anyone wanting to see a story of how regular Germans experienced life under Nazi Germany.",7,2,4,9 March 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," More than a superhero film
","Not being a fan of captain America and not enjoying the first film, because it was full of clichés, I was quite surprised by this movie. It was actually really good! For a Marvel film this is definitely great and one of my favourite superhero films now.It was a welcome change to see a superhero film tell a tale which involves politics, security and the role of authority. Captain America is a great choice for tell us a story because of what he represents: the ideal American in superhero form. Well done to all involved for going beyond a straight-cut comic book-to-film adaptation and making a memorable story.As with any superhero and action film there are movie mistakes, ridiculous moments and inconsistent character actions. Often these can ruin a film however in this instance being a superhero film, and a good story, it doesn't detract at all and instead you'll be interested all the way through.I can easily recommend this to anyone.",8,2,4,8 April 2014
Pacific Rim," I love giants robots fighting
","As a child of the 90s I loved TMNT, robots, ninjas, and more. Seeing a well funded and crafted film with giant robots fighting monsters is great. Had I been born 15-20 years later this film would be the greatest thing I'd have seen.As an adult I still enjoyed watching this. It did take me back, but it's difficult to enjoy it entirely without noticing it's flaws. It has a few but it doesn't stop one enjoyment. They just make you want to question the crew, e.g. why not use swords straight away. Forget the blood theories, the ease of using a sword makes complete sense when punching and pummelling a kaiju causes property destruction and increased chances of death for pilots.Aside from that and some ordinary acting in parts it's a fun film. See it if you have the chance but don't go out of your way.",6,1,3,14 October 2013
Rush," F1 finally has an amazing film
","This is an amazing film. I can't recommend it highly enough for F1 fans like me, sports fans, or anyone interested in a story of rivalry i.e. something different to the unoriginal junk movies which get churned out each year.All the crew involved should pat themselves on the back. They've done a fabulous job making this film critique, explore and honour two memorable F1 drivers.James Hunt's fun, party lifestyle along with his brash and raw driving talent. This is contrasted against Niki Lauda's methodical thinking, technical brilliance and professional lifestyle. These two characters are total opposites but as their lives are explored it also acknowledges the value of an enemy, i.e. something to beat. I believe this is a commentary on human nature in that the best of us shines when we have something to beat or overcome.Do yourself a favour and see it now.",10,243,271,16 September 2013
Man of Steel," Solid return to the cinema
","Man of Steel is a great return for Superman. Great in many aspects and particularly in the beginning half where the back-story is explained.Acting here is good in some parts, bad in others. Everyone except Lois Lane was fine considering this is an interpretation of superman, not a translation. What I thought was unbelievable is Lois Lane and Superman falling for each other. A crush is plausible but Superman is here, there and everywhere. So how can a crush turn into love when he's hardly around Lois to develop anything? Story is also quite good except, again, Lois Lane appearing and going to places she'd never get near. The emotional content around what happens to Krypton is very, very good.A superhero movie that focuses on emotion, story, spectacle, and enjoyment is what I wanted out of this. It delivers.",8,2,6,11 July 2013
Ender's Game," Good and entertaining
","Knowing nothing about this book I was lead to believe this film was going to be action orientated. It is not but that's not a bad thing because it's a character and story focused film. It doesn't go for too long, you aren't bored, and want to see how it ends. I was satisfied.The visuals of this film are great. I particularly enjoyed the zero G room used for the launchies' training exercises. In the future I suggest this be made available for recreation as it looks like a lot of fun. Also worth praising is how battles are shown from the holographic screens which zoom, tilt and pan to give ender the best view possible. It's almost like a video game except I asked 'how can he view battles like this'. Because surely in the heat of battle any drone cameras would be destroyed. But this is a minor grievance of how realistic viewing battles this way would be.All the cast suited their roles except for Ben Kingsley. The could've chosen Temuera Morrison who is a Maori and looks like a soldier for example. But he was in the new star wars trilogy which is why I think he was overlooked. Furthermore his character claims to be ender's enemy during training however he is actually another mentor of Ender's. A mismatch in dialogue and execution I think.At the end I had questions and got locked into discussion all the way home. I thought about events and occurrences not making sense or weren't explained properly. I thought about what I would do in Ender's situation. I thought about what was real and what wasn't. I lastly thought about the last scene and saying 'that isn't believable'. I thought and talking about a lot, but my friends and I agreed; this is a good but not great film yet entertaining nonetheless.I went we read the book and the second book Speaker for the Dead. If Ender's Game was not filmable then Speaker of the Dead is as likely as pigs flying. I also read the author does not want it made into a film.",7,3,8,28 October 2013
The Lego Movie," Best animated film since Toy Story 3
","Thus far this is tied with Her as my favourites for 2014. There is a lot to like about this movie especially having seen it in 3D which enhances just how entertaining this is. A obvious comment - this is Lego brought to life! I loved how well thought through this movie was. Whilst it references popular culture both through characters of other stories but also Internet memes such as Batman's capacity to achieve anything. It has aptly timed humour that was refreshingly unexpected. But most of all I really enjoyed how to the story unfolded with the presence of real world items; the end result being an acknowledgement of the creativity found in a child's mind and how adults can inhibit this. Brilliant.On that note I really appreciated the deeper meaning in this film and how well rounded the message is: creativity shouldn't be limited to those who think freely and originally. Anyone is capable of creativity whether it be complete new, a slight different, or a revised of something already present. But beyond that independent creativity thought should be applauded communal creative thought should be too. As well as creative thought derived from instructions.Toy Story 3 was the last animation film I saw which was explored childhood and what it meanings, including growing up. It was a masterpiece which hasn't been topped. Lego Movie is not as good and is different but what it does share is an equally relevant showcase of experiences children have.I trust you, like me, walked away from this movie wanting to play with Lego, play Mindcraft or do something creative. Wonderful!",9,2,6,26 February 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Oscar winning performances
","Wow. No wonder Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto won Oscars for this film. They're both brilliant in showcasing two faces of AIDS sufferers which oppose each other; one being a fighter doing all they can to prolong their life and the other succumbing to their disease by giving in and not taking their treatment seriously. What's beautiful is the characters themselves are polar opposites and this disease brings them together which results in helping many people.Unlike Philadelphia which gave us a personal story which shows us a complete journey of an AIDS sufferer til death, this film instead chooses to highlight how different people react to a disease differently. It also highlights how much of a joke the US health system is, particularly in how they addressed AIDS - other countries were putting out drugs which were effective and easier to access; whereas the US would put a harmful product out as a reaction to public need without proper analysis whilst also limiting access. When the film ended I wanted to see more of Ron Woodruff's story or at least a photo of what he looked like.It's a must see film that will surprisingly make you laugh too.",9,2,3,7 March 2014
Now You See Me," Refreshingly fun
","How refreshing it is to see a film where the child in you is brought out and bewildered. I found myself smiling from start to finish in awe of the magic and suspense.Perhaps it is the magic or rather trickery that had me smiling; you don't know how they do it and a part of you thinks it is magic. But of course you know it isn't there must be a trick. Either way you have a good time regardless. I found myself agasp much in the same way someone would be if they were personally tricked by a magician.It is cleverly written, humorous, and has action. What more could you ask from such a fun movie?",8,3,8,18 June 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Entertaining if nothing else
","The Desolation of Smaug is a little less boring than the previous instalment, but it's really no better in terms of craft and narrative. Therere is one inspired action sequence in which the dwarfs and Bilbo escape from the elves in barrels. This sequence recalls Jackson's King Kong set pieces where he just builds ideas on top of ideas into an extended adventure. And that's it. Then it's all back to normal.Whilst the Lord of the Rings were Oscar-winning technical marvels, the biggest issue I have with this and Journey is that the story is so mundane that we're left looking for a visual 'wow' factor, and it's not there. The barrel sequence was so clever, I didn't care how the effects looked. The generic archery and dragon hunting wasn't creatively captivating, and it certainly wasn't visually so.Overall it's entertaining and it's quite obvious the source material is so short that the crew had no choice but to embellish on the story. And add plenty of visual effects as filler to prolong this story across three films.If you're seek an absolutely 100% accurate book to film translation you will be unhappy. But if you want to be entertained and can overlook this you'll have a nice time",7,0,2,15 January 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Adventure, charm and good story telling
","Never having seen a Wes Anderson film before allowed me to witness a distinctive way to tell and present story. The way Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) charms everyone in this film and how loyally professional Zero (Tony Revolori) is makes these two a wonderful duo. I can't think of a film that tells an adventurous story whilst also exploring a mentor/protégé relationship so effectively. In fact it left me yearning for a mentor of my own that I have sought and failed to encounter in my own life. Telling a tale in a fictional country that draws upon the culture and history of several countries was very clever Mr Anderson. It is a great device to enable a slightly unbelievable, slightly magical, slightly silly and overall enjoyable story to unfold without us criticising historical accuracy. Yet still the film is presented in a serious enough manner for us not to dismiss everything a stupid. The achieve such a solid balance takes great talent.I only have two complaints with this film: Firstly, the ending is rather abrupt where very major events occur in Zero's life off screen. Why? It prevents us from sympathising and valuing Zero's story to the maximum possible capacity. I can think of multiple reasons but nevertheless it lessened my enjoyment of the film.Secondly, casting F. Murray Abraham as an older Zero is a terrible choice; not because of acting ability but rather his likeness to Tony Revolori. It is hard to believe someone of Guatemalan descent will transform into someone of Syrian descent in later life!",7,0,9,19 March 2014
Behind The Candelabra," A must see
","From the very beginning of the film I knew this was going to be a rock solid drama. The trailer is completely accurately gives you a sneak peak into a great film that has all you want; believable acting, costumes, setting, musical performance and surprisingly comedy.There are sex scenes to those you might be ambiguous about seeing this movie. They are quite tolerable as you don't see any penetration or anything too vulgar. There is one scene with Matt Damon onto top of Michael Douglas that is quick and not graphic. Most of the sex is discussed or occurs of screen.Mostly surprisingly as I mentioned before is the comedy element. It is not obvious if it was intentional or a result of us now knowing what these well dressed men were up to. Either way Rob Lowe's stiff facial expressions are poignantly funny.If you have any interest in seeing this film I highly recommend that you do see it. Films like these don't come along that often; it gives shows us Liberace's lifestyle, his showmanship, the nature of gay relationships in the 70's & 80's, and has a respectfully emotional ending.",9,1,3,17 June 2013
Mr. Nobody," Choices
","Firstly, to see this film you must be in an open mindset. Otherwise you will not understand or receive the topics shown and their meaning.My first thoughts afterwards were appreciation for covering topics which many people seek guidance for and is usually found through various means, e.g. religion, introspection, or other means. Presenting such a story in a nonlinear narrative does make it difficult to understand however it highlights one common factor in all our lives, i.e. choices. These choices all lead to different paths and the possible causative factors which influence these choices (discussing various theories).After the credits rolled I had to think for a minute to explain the ending. Discussing with a friend I watched it with lead us to somewhat understand it all. However ultimately we need to do some research online to read the opinions and explanations of others. It became clear the ending is either shows which choice is the right one or leaves us to interpret it how we want. Either way this an enjoyable and thought provoking movie.",8,1,2,8 December 2013
Frozen," Hateable
","Never before have I walked out of a film. I don't understand why this film is advertised and sold as yet another well rounded hallmark Disney animated film. Instead this is a female centric story focusing on sisterhood, aimed at a female demographic with unnecessarily long songs.Instead of having a story focused upon on the ice queen or her sister, they try and do both. It fails especially because the sister, Anna, is a lonely young girl yet is well adjusted and unrealistically happy in her situation. Her clumsiness and the ridiculous timing of Prince Hans' interactions with her is exactly what we'd find in a romantic comedy; i.e. a clichéd silly, clumsy girl being lovestruck with the perfect gentleman.To top this off in the first 20 mins we have to endure 3 long songs, 3! As if 1 isn't enough. Admittedly I loathe singing in cartoons (because they are a distraction, elongate film, serve little purpose and/or are a clichéd introspective moment where a character finds resolution in song) but I wished the trailer showed this film for what it really is.",2,22,45,26 January 2014
Prisoners," Kept me guessing
","I was rather impressed with this film. It kept me interested all the way to the end with the extra element of mystery, which challenges the viewer to make sense of everything. The acting by all major characters was great particularly Hugh Jackman showing fear and rage at the same time. It's been a while since I seen a film like this.The writers of this film definitely succeeded in creating a story that is cryptic and compelling. At the end I thought back over the film to see how objects, people, and other things were connected to what occurred. I didn't even understand why and how things occurred or were connected which created a lot of discussion afterwards. My partner and I shared our thoughts of what we understood; it took both of us to make sense of it all. Good writing and that correct application of it certain shows when it takes two educated people to understand everything.This film also made me think about justice and what I would do: is the law always correct? Should we take the law into our own hands? Are laws too black and white? Whether intended or not this opens a dialogue about right and wrong, trusting police, and rational thinking.",8,1,2,19 October 2013
2001: A Space Odyssey," A classic
","This truly is the fantastic film everyone says it is... almost. Yes it was ahead of it's time, yes it was groundbreaking in many areas and yes it is memorable. It is the brilliant film people say it is.It is not perfect however. It is slow, has little dialogue, and is cryptic. But these gripes of mine are offset my great cinematography and a powerful soundtrack. In fact the lack of dialogue is used to great effect to enable the viewer to marvel and awe at the beauty of space.I'm glad to have finally seen it and recommend this defining film. Just be aware it is not going to be what you expect as it is unique.",8,1,3,24 May 2013
12 Years a Slave," A very memorable tale
","Chiwetel Ejiofor is an actor I've been a fan of for some time now. I first took notice of him in Serenity, then was quite pleased with his performances in Children of Men, Redbelt, and Salt. 12 Years a Slave shows us just how talent his is. Through him we see joy, contentment, fear, horror, hate, anger, reluctance, hopelessness, and gratitude. He will be remembered as one of the greats.Like many have said this is a very brutally honest depiction of life as a slave. It's truly horrible and Solomon's journey shows us a range of different he encounters. Amongst those who 'own' him we see truly evil people, opportunists, kind-hearted slavers and cruel slavers. Amongst his fellow slaves we see people who are helpful, selfish, indifferent, and traumatised. Through him we experience the worst of human nature and indifference to the suffering of others.Solomon's ordeal shows us that even as a slave not everyone (but almost) enjoyed treating African slaves as property to do with as they wished, and were barely human. This story serves as a reminder of how far Western civilisation has come today, when compared to the rapid industrialist expansion which caused slavery of Africans to begin. Through this story we're able to see that social justice is of utmost importance",8,0,2,26 January 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Possibly the best of 2014
","My first thought afterwards was ' wow a lot of people, particularly men, are going to walk away from this and say 'yeah I wanna be a stock broker too'! regardless of the message told through this movie '. Admittedly I felt the same way, especially seeing Jordan Belfort and his colleagues enjoying themselves so much. I mean c'mon booze, hookers, lavish parties, drugs, good times, who doesn't want that; at least a little bit? But that's the hook all sales jobs promise: if you work hard, don't be discouraged by failures and have the ambition to succeed then you will. Because everyone can be a millionaire right? Wrong. Not everyone can be otherwise millionaires would be everywhere. Truth is you can bust your guts and you may not make anywhere as much as you desired. Big bosses need bums in seats to make them money not you.And that's exactly what Jordan Belfort does. He even admits this during the film. Of course the commission paid to his workers made them a decently living but the real income goes to Belfort. And he makes a lot! To much to know what to do with.Through all the funny situations (and there is plenty of those) we see Belfort and co. revelling in greed and success. This obvious draws the attention of the law and it's their stupidity that becomes their undoing, despite some very lucky turns of fortunate beforehand.The first lesson I learnt from this movie is to name your price and get out when you reach it. That's what a strategically minded investor would do instead of being greedy.The second lesson is if you're doing something illegal and you draw attention to yourself you will get caught eventually. Not if but when.It does have some shortcomings. For the sake of entertainment what they actually sell and how they do it is glossed over because the focus is upon what happens, not why. I also didn't like the pace of the film as it has so much to tell a lot of it is rushed, which explains why they gloss over details for the sake of timing.This is a thoroughly entertaining movie about making money that has more relevance in this decade than prior films before it.",9,0,3,26 January 2014
The Wolverine," More story and character than expected
","To my surprise this film is quite good. Largely because it focuses on story and character with humour thrown in for good measure. Action sequences and the superpowers support this film instead which makes this a far better film than just another superhero movie. The story could be called predictable. Logan is tormented over killing Jean Grey and shes her when awake and sleeping. Her presence and inherent craziness forces him to live as a homeless man in the wild. A chance to say goodbye to an old friend gives him a chance for redemption. Those of us who have seen this story before could predict the outcome however it is still interesting because Japan is an interesting setting, we want Logan to get the peace he deserves, and poignant action scenes give us a chance to see Logan vent his anger.Much better than I expected it to be.",8,16,34,6 August 2013
Flight," A decent enough film
","This is not an amazing movie, nor is it a bad movie. It is enjoyable with all actors involved portraying believable characters.The strongest parts of the film are the first 30 minutes and the last 30 minutes. Your brain can switch off during the middle as it is quite boring and doesn't impact the ending. True it does build the story towards the climax and develops the main character but overall who can miss it and it won't make any difference.Of particular note is the hotel rooms scene near the end. Really funny and brought back memories similar to a friend of mine known also for their 'vices'.",7,1,2,24 May 2013
Her," Best original screenplay in a while
","Jonze's script is smattered with ideas that add to the texture of her. Many scenes show Theodore strolling through the streets, persons around him with their heads down, occupied with their ear pieces. An all-too-familiar image in today's phone-obsessed culture that paints a kind of low-key, apocalyptic picture. The director takes a few jabs at gaming culture too — in the future, video games finally give up and just let all the characters scream swear words, racist insults, and misogynistic non sequiturs familiar to anyone who has spent time playing Call of Duty multiplayer.Her's moral questions dig even deeper than the idea of man/machine relationships. Late in the film, Samantha introduces Theodore to an OS pieced together by the writings of a deceased philosopher. Programmers have revived the dead in A.I. form. And somehow, that's less advanced than what the operating systems are doing on their own.Her is staggering in scope while exploring the tiniest facets of intimacy and attraction. Phoenix's introspection thrives in Jonze's living, breathing sci-fi landscape, accompanied by Arcade Fire's soft piano melodies that feel like Theodore's own digital signal. her builds and builds in unexpected ways as it climbs towards a profound conclusion, as messy, passionate, impactful relationships always do. Examining his own life, Theodore tells Amy that he worries, 'I have felt everything I want to feel.' her digs into that rumination, stretching it across the past, present, and future.The masterfully done science fiction film her features a remarkable performance from Joaquin Phoenix and a moving, intelligent story directed with restraint by Spike Jonze.",9,1,2,5 March 2014
The Great Gatsby," Looks and sounds great with a boring story
","Baz Luhrmann's films each have a distinct visual and aural quality to them. We are witness to vibrant colours, sweeping camera movements, sudden zooming in, and mystery which is supporting by a suitable soundtrack. These features translate well into the 1920's setting to transport the viewer into a bygone era. However despite all these positives even they cannot make a really long, slow and dull story any more watchable. You may argue with me that I don't understand the story. I admit I haven't read the book and went into this completely unaware of what will occur; from what I've read this film is the closest to translate the book into a film correctly. That being said my impression of the metaphors and underlying meanings is a satire of the 1920's; i.e. too much drinking and partying, people talk rubbish, the wealthy have more money than sense, you can't recapture the past, parties are a ruse, and not a lot of meaningful activities occurred (this is what I left the cinema thinking about). That being said I didn't enjoy the story or the characters and was never convinced really liked, cared for or loved each other (which I understood as an intention of the author). Therefore if I understand the story correct then this is one of the most overrated stories (and novels) I've ever encountered. Why is it so memorable? Praise must be given to the use of modern music instead of jazz as it is a clever juxtaposition. Most of us don't enjoy jazz music like those in the film do; we enjoy modern music mostly and its use bridges the gap between us. Therefore we understand how they feel and the parties which ensue. All actors involved were convincing in their roles but no-one here stood out. One thing I did notice was Nick Carraway mentioned several times that Gatsby was the most hopeful person he'd met. We never really saw his hope because he was both cool and calm, scared, worried or lashing out. This is either a failure of the script or a translation of the author's intentions.I applaud those involved for at least making this film watchable for the visual and aural aspects. This almost makes up for a long, slow and dull story.",5,3,7,5 June 2013
