Hereditary," What a Waste Of Time
","A few seconds after the credits start to roll up my thought was only about all those old suspense-horror movies done in the past with so few financial support but with great results in the end.
What happened in the past years with this kind of movies. Did we just forgot how to do it? What a waste of time.",4,1,4,16 September 2018
Prometheus," OK but not the movie I expected
","First of all, was there a need for 3D? I don't think so. Start using 3D where you can get the most of it. Then the movie itself. It seemed that we were going for another Alien kind of movie trip, but then meaning of life and creationism come along, a doctor that after having a self cirurgic intervention still moves faster than anyone and the constant links to Alien Saga made the rest. Visually perfect. But it lacks argument bases. We Had some much noise about these movie previous to his debut that I surely was hopping for something more. Never the less, for lovers of this saga, it's one not to miss. The beginning of the legend is there. Yeah, this is a prequel.",7,0,1,24 June 2012
1408," Whip out your fears
","Mike Enslin (Cusack) wage his life writing books about Hotels which are supposed to be haunted. Until now he his a non-believer and has manage to blow out every single superstition in every single place he has been. But now something different is ahead. A room in the Dolphin Hotel seems to have something more than just a scary story. The room 1408 is the room to whip out all the Enslin fears. Based upon a Stephen King's tale this is one more with is seal. Terror, suspense and something special for the end. However I true think this is not the best of the best and at times it seems you seen it all, but still captivate the eye and it is worth to see.",6,1,2,6 July 2007
Life," Same Old Alien and Starships Storyline
","Although I always try to catch something that really makes the difference in this kind of movie, I think the objective fails in 99% of them. I kept the all movie guessing the next move right and even the even was predictable. This is one time movie for me. Although well done and great cgi (or some like that) effects. It just could not raise a goosebump from me.",6,1,4,10 June 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Yes. Disappointment Lives Here
","What a mess. Although some good scenes and the extreme pace of it this chapter two is a big disappointment. It seems like someone said that it was mandatory to make a second movie only to make money. Something just don't seem to get right. History breaks, things that don't make sense and a confusing shoot out from the beginning to the end. Was not John Wick the top of the top paid assassins?",6,1,3,17 June 2017
