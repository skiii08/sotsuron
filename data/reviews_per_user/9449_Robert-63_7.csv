50 First Dates," Don't think you like Adam Sandler? Try this one
","This is only the second Adam Sandler movie I've actually looked forward to seeing. The first was _Punch-Drunk Love_, and that was something I was eager to see more because of P. T. Anderson than Sandler, but was pleasantly surprised by Sandler's performance. This time around, I went in knowing that Sandler had it in him to entertain me, and he did a good job. His schtick is much more in evidence here than in _Punch-Drunk_, and I imagine from other comments that this is much more of a typical Sandler vehicle. However, it is a very sweet story with a lot of humor and heart, and would be a terrific first Adam Sandler film to see if you don't like him.Drew Barrymore is delightfully fun as Lucy, believably delivering all kinds of unexpected character details like 'feelski' and the way she asks questions about all her old friends. Blake Clark and Sean Astin do the best they can with their rather thinly drawn characters. Clark, as usual, lets his voice do most of his acting for him, but he's a treat here as Lucy's father; likewise, Astin takes a turn at using a distinctive vocal style to give his character depth, but unfortunately misses the mark and winds up being just another caricature in a movie that already has 3 by the time we meet him (Alexa, Ula, and Nick the cook).It is really in the relationship between Lucy and her family that the main weaknesses of this story come out. It seems to me that given how much time the filmmaker spends showing us what a user Henry is, everyone is entirely too trusting of him, though that is probably just a side-effect of the way the movie skips over time as Henry becomes part of their lives. Still, after Marlin's 'anybody who's alright with that ain't alright with me' comment, he seems amazingly quick to accept that Henry means well.I was also disappointed that we never got a payoff from Marlin's photographing Lucy's paintings before painting over them each night. I wonder if that got left on the cutting room floor, and if so why. I thought it showed a real sense of appreciation by him for who she really is. I was also a little disappointed that once the idea is introduced that Lucy can be told the truth, it apparently *never* occurs to anyone that she might be most comfortable hearing the truth *from herself.*This is one of those movies that from the first time I see the trailer, I start wondering, okay, good set-up, but can they end it right? Well, here's where this movie really does remind me of _Punch-Drunk Love_, because for one thing the ending is very satisfying, and for another it arises out of the character's own strengths instead of relying on something out of the blue.Original grade: 8 out of 10. Very good: something I'll want to see again.Revised grade (3/7/2012): 7 out of 10. Worth seeing, but once will probably do.",7,0,0,8 March 2004
World War Z," Seems like a preview of the Director's Cut
","There is so much off-screen violence, so many plot holes, so many places in this film where something starts and then ends without any sense of a middle to it that it feels almost like the version I saw (the PG-13, single-disc DVD version, in case later re-releases muddle the issue) was the edited-for-TV version or the cut they put together just so they could later release a Director's Cut with all the sense put back in.Giving the hero of an action film a family to worry about is a choice filmmakers rarely go for, but it is effective here in establishing his motive for survival. Unfortunately, all the teasing about 'what I used to do' from Brad Pitt never pays off. We never learn that he used to be a sniper assassin or an accountant or anything back when he did whatever it did that was so disturbing in his past. That's just one disappointment the film features. Revealing more would venture into spoiler territory.6 out of 10: Worth seeing, not worth recommending.",6,0,0,18 October 2013
The Hunger Games," Fine adaptation, more action-heavy than the book, well worth seeing.
","This is a fine action film which I think will leave both those who have read and those who have not read the source material pleased. It's faithful to the source in its broad strokes, if a little disappointing in leaving out some key scenes I felt made the book special. I was surprised they kept in as much of the ending as they did, but felt they did it well, considering what they excised in getting there.When a movie is adapted from a well-known book, some people will always have anxiety that lines of dialog, characters, actions, pieces of jewelry will all have some deep hidden meaning that they are somehow missing out on fully appreciating if they have not read the book.Some people recognize that the way to fix this is to read the book before they see the movie. Some people, alas, do not. Instead they see the movie with someone who *has* read the book, and at every change of scene ask, 'What is that, is that important?' apparently completely forgetting the simple dictum of films made for the general public that IF SOMETHING IS REALLY IMPORTANT IT WILL BE EXPLAINED TO YOU.A person of the latter type and his enabling date were sitting behind me for _The Hunger Games_, and it was during the tracker jacker sequence that I nearly had to turn around in my seat and remind him of this simple dictum. In the book, Katniss has a page or two to explain, after she spies the hive, what tracker jackers are. It can take a few minutes to read. In the movie, it takes literally a few seconds for the broadcasters of the Games to explain what is going on, and yet somehow there was time for the anxious gentleman behind me to ask his date, 'What are 'tracker jackers'? Are they important?' *and* for her to actually start answering him before the 0.4 seconds of screen time passed that it took for the characters to answer his question for him.Turning this simple dictum to a later point in the film, I would say that the wild dog beasts are sufficiently well-explained as created by the Gamemakers to provide a new challenge to the Tributes without going into the Muttations as they are explained in the book, and without needing to add the emotional conflict created by the specific origins of these Muttations.I have to say, two fine points of Collins's writing did not strike me until I was watching the movie. One is related to the wild dog Muttations and Peeta's desire to die 'as himself.' The other is the nice touch of the final outcome of the Hunger Games being decided by something they choose to eat.",7,0,5,26 March 2012
Cold Mountain," Mix 1 part Homer's Odyssey, 1 part Gone with the Wind. Chill.
","If someone had told me they were making a movie based in equal parts on Homer's Odyssey and Gone with the Wind, I'd have said 'That could be good.' And indeed, it could have been good. But this isn't.The director seems to have decided, for one thing, that the best way to make the audience really feel the passage of three years is to keep them in the theater for as significant a fraction of that time as possible. The book this movie is based on is about 350 pages long. About two-thirds of the way through the movie, I began to feel like I was in for a page-per-minute interpretation.As little regard as I have for her, I must confess that Renee Zellweger is the only reason to see this movie. Her comic relief, in addition to being much needed, is wonderfully done, and she comes closest to having anything like an accurate dialect.If you've heard like I did that this film got snubbed for Oscar nominations because (a) Nicole looks too glamorous or (b) it was filmed in Europe instead of on location in North Carolina, let me assure you: there are hundreds and hundreds of good reasons this movie didn't get more nominations. You can count them on your watch.Original grade: 6 out of 10, 1 mark above 'never should have been made'Revised grade (3/7/2012): 4 out of 10. Bad. Significantly flawed but gets credit for a worthy attempt.",4,0,0,8 February 2004
City of God," Dazzling, dizzying, but ultimately just another shoot-em-up
","Being based on a true story, having lots of non-actors, making some very imaginative choices in cinematography, and so forth, this film really throws a lot of stuff at you, and it is impressive in its ability to keep a great many plates spinning in the air (although to tell the truth, if the narrator had said 'but it's not time to tell So-and-so's story yet' just one more time, I would have screamed).Unfortunately, the next day when you look back on the experience, you realize that all you really got was a couple of hours worth of just another gangland storyline with a little too much Guy-Ritchie-influenced camera work and more than a few this-will-get-them-talking shock cinema moments.Original grade: 6 out of 10. Worth seeing, probably not worth recommending.Revised grade (3/7/2012): 1 out of 10. Abysmal. Horribly bad in a way that makes me think less of people who think it's good.",1,18,44,14 February 2004
Drive," It's like John Hughes made an ultra-violent action movie
","Between the cheesy font used for the titles and the heavy-handed song placement, this film really is sort of like John Hughes made an ultra-violent action movie.There's as much here to like as there is to groan over, but there's no denying that it is an amusement-park-ride of a film with lots of fun and action-packed sequences, albeit with two of the most taciturn leading roles since 'The Artist.' Carey Mulligan is horribly under-utilized in a role that needed someone just a touch more haggard to be believable; explaining that she's two years younger than her husband thinks she is helps, but doesn't solve the problem. Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman make a great tough-guy duo: I'd much rather see a prequel with them than the inevitable sequel with Gosling's character.",6,1,4,3 April 2012
The Truman Show," Not as original as I thought
","I was one of a great many people who saw this movie and were blown away at how original it was.Then, a few nights ago, while flipping channels, I caught the last five minutes of an episode of Twilight Zone, The (1985). The episode (I've learned after digging a little) was titled 'Special Service' and was episode 3.27, airing in 1988. It concerns a regular guy who discovers that his entire life has been orchestrated and broadcast as a cable TV show.I guess it just goes to show that all of us who thought, 'Man, what a Twilight-Zone concept that movie was!' were more right than we could have known!Grade: 7 out of 10. Good. Worth seeing, but once will probably do.",7,2,3,25 April 2000
