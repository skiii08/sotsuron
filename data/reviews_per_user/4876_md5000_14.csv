The Avengers," The Avengers Real Movie Review
","I just saw The Avengers movie and still don't know what to say about it.Its Funny that real everyday people write real reviews on this moviesite and the next entries placed above the reviews are from fake accounts giving this movie 8 or 10 stars,real talk.This is a 5 star movie.Its good but not great. The Avengers is first of all- Not the best movie ever made nor is The Avengers better than The Dark Knight or even Spiderman 2. If someone tells you different , they may have the mind of a five year old. The action is good and the characters all play their roles great, but something is missing in this movie.If the main villain Loki and his crew of aliens became a threat to any city in the U.S. I would laugh and take my chances. Am I the only one wondering where were the U.S.Airforce ,Marines,Army or even the Navy,when a whole entire city is being attacked ? Who were the aliens shooting at when they came from outerspace ? They sure wasn't hitting the people running around in the middle of the street during the entire battle scene.Did any hardworking bank employee,cop,or other random person running in the street get hurt? I didn't see any. Bad writing and action sequences ruined this movie. I was also wondering,couldn't Thor just electrocute most of the aliens for about 30 mins instead of fighting them one on one? He can control lighting. I would still say this movie is entertaining but watched by fans and viewers with common sense , this movie is a comedy and very very very overrated.",5,6,17,17 May 2012
Iron Man 3," Ironman 3 : Ruined
","I going to start this review like this. I would give this movie a 1 or zero, but for the special effects ,I'll give it a 2 or 3. This is what movie goers get now.Since the Cup Cake Avengers earned half a billon dollars off pure fluff and slapstick comedy , Hollywood and its nerd script writers will continue to release and alter popular novel, comic books, or even movies from the past. I walked away from this movie like WTF did I just watch? Disney has bought Marvel? well. This movie along with the Avengers 2 is going to be the norm. I hope fans don't get their hopes up for Star Wars , there's probably going to be a musical in it and Mickey Mouse is going to have a quick cameo in it along with Justin Biever playing a new Jedi. I'm done with Marvel Cupcake movies , I plan to see The Man of Steel , but seeing reviews on that I'm becoming hesitant.",2,2,5,20 June 2013
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A Real Review of Rogue One- A Star Wars Story
","First off I will like to give praise and thanks to director Gareth Edwards.Finally someone has brought a movie that ADDS something to the Star Wars universe not diminish it. That being said Rogue One is easily the best movie of 2016.The millons of Star wars fans who waited in lines,spent crazy money,and had high hopes for The Force Awakens, your memory of that trash has been Erased. From the characters,storyline, and the fantastic visuals, this movie is grade A. Rogue One is long lost- Real- Star Wars Movie that fans have waited over 20,25 ,30, well any year to be released . This move was done right and this I cant say was done for the garbage that was Force Awakens. JJ Abrams should be embarrassed the trash he put on screen last year. Rogue One gives me hope Disney will do something good with the Star Wars name.",9,4,9,19 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A Real Review of Star Wars The Last Jedi
","After months from the release of this movie , Disney is still paying reviewers to score this movie over 7 or 8 stars. This movie was not only the worst Star Wars movie ever made, it was one of the worst movies in the last 5 to 8 years ever shown on a movie screen. The plot made no sense, the characters made no sense and even the ending of this terrible movie made no sense. After destroying a iconic character like Luke Skywalker in this crap fest movie , I'm done watching anymore Star Wars Universe movies by Disney. And yes the character of Rey is a joke and a over powered Mary Sue character that can never be beaten and never had form of training.",1,15,21,4 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A Real Review of Star Wars The Last Jedi
","There is nothing else to say about his movie . All the negative reviews and reviewers are absolutely right about this movie. This movie is the worst Star Wars movie ever made , the worst common sense movie ever made, the worst plot in a movie ever made and the worst way to treat a character who paved the way for this Star Wars universe to ebe created ever done by a studio . All Disney wants to do is make comedies with these new franchises they have hacked into.No Plot or good story writing or common sense .Disney has ruined the superhero movies along with Star Wars now and are moving to ruin whatever is left of the X-men universe . It's over for good action movies .",1,3,4,31 December 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The Avengers Age of Who???
","I'll be quick on this review. it's funny how people on here give this movie 8 out of 10 stars or say it's the best super hero movie they have seen.The Avengers movie came out in 2012. This movie came out in 2015.This is the Same Exact Formula and Sequences from the First Avenger movie!! A bad guy appears or comes to Earth,he wants to destroy Earth, The Avengers find out about him, the Avengers fight him and lose the first fight,they then regroup and fight not just the bad guy but a bunch of faceless henchmen and they win, Hooray!! And then while you are eating your popcorn near brain dead , The Hulk fights one of the Avengers- Not the bad guy---and tears up something .It really shows people will pay to see anything and there are no more writers or story creators in Hollywood.I can't believe Captain America the Winter Soldier was better than this .",3,31,65,3 May 2015
Don't Breathe," A Real Review of Don't Breathe
","This movie started off pretty interesting. A group of burglars robbing a rich family's house. Why you ask? The audience doesn't know.But we are treated to a bodily fluid screen shot that should have been cut from the film.Right then the movie goes into the gutter.I never seen a group of robbers talk so loud and use guns to open doors and safes in a home invasion. And to top all this off, I've never seen a main character get beaten ,stabbed and shot _ in the same movie_ and still have enough energy to run and fight the villain.This movie was a good concept but ended up being plain stupid.This movie should serve the purpose of how Not to make a horror movie.",2,37,76,11 October 2016
12 Years a Slave," 12 Years A Slave
","I must say this is a powerful film with a lot of emotion and truths about slavery.This film is easily the best film of the year and should win numerous awards.I don't have any dislikes for this film and I have not read the book about the movie so in all I have to say this is a good movie.In reading other reviews on this movie I have to question some movie goers mentality.This movie showed the some of the truths of slavery and the struggle of one man as he experiences these events for the first time.This movie is not Hollywood coated or made to be a comedy with a weak storyline and plot like most movies that are in theaters now.With the terrible movies Hollywood has been churning out over the last few years, this is one of the best screen play and acted dramas to date. This is a must see.",9,2,5,10 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Real Review of Star Wars The Force Awakens
","First I will explain, I'm not a paid critic or fan boy or anything like that I just see some movies and give people a real review of a movie.Its mind blowing to see this movie is receiving ratings of 8 or 10 and people saying this is the best movie they have ever seen.The Star Wars Awaken movie has good visuals,but bad writing,bad story and to make thing worst, a very bad villain.The only thing JJ Abrams has done to the fooled masses is copy the same plot and story break up some of the exact moments in previous movies and tell the world he has directed and created a new Star Wars.I will ask only the few people in the world who have common sense.Why would a newly formed Empire or copy cat Empire i would say ,create another Death Star? This failed before, so someone will make a even bigger one that drains a sun and is bigger than a small galaxy?This is proof scripts in Hollywood are not edited or even looked over by high execs,or even story writers with great ideas with bringing a new experience to movie goers.I have never seen in my years of movies a main villain with power get man handled by weak regular characters.And as a result people around the world praising that this movie is the greatest thing that has ever been on a movie screen.The Star Wars Force Awakens movie is a Billion Dollar Fraud, it has fooled millions there are only a handful in this world it has not fooled.",2,115,197,31 December 2015
Flight," Flight
","Flight is one of the better movies released this year. Its a emotional movie and I think it served this movie well.The entire cast was great, that you can't say for a ton of movies that have been released lately.The story it's self flowed evenly thru the movie.I haven't seen to many negative reviews of this movie and that's a good thing.It shows a lot of reviewers and movie goers know a good movie when they see one.For the few negative reviewers of this movie , I bet Hangover 2 and Transformers are movie master pieces in their eyes.And that's really sad.I hope Hollywood producers and directors take more time to release movies with better story's, plots, and drama.",9,1,4,10 May 2013
Kingsman: The Secret Service," The Kingsmen Review
","Wow,this movie started off good.There was a good story with the son joining the secret Kingsmen just like his father, then stopping someone who wants to cause chaos in the world. I don't know if I watched two movies in one or what ? There first half was good and everything was leading up for this to be a good movie. The second half turned into a complete different movie.This movie is to the point it shouldn't have been released if what you call action is senseless shootings and exploding body parts are all over the screen. I totally forgot what was the point of this movie after the anal sex reference. Where is good writing and screen play for movies ?? This movie could have been a hit but it's a low brow waste of time for me or anyone who has common sense. that's what's missing now in America, common sense.",1,55,102,10 May 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Real Review Of Mad Max : Fury Road
","I will be quick on this review like always.I finally got around to see this movie and I have to say, Fury Road is the best action movie this year.It has a simple script,get to one place and then a lot happens in between.It works for this kind of movie.I thought Hardy and Theron did their roles pretty good.The thing about this movie is your interested and engaged about whats going on the entire movie. Unlike the marvel full comedy hour Avenger movies,the moviegoer feels the action and wants to see what happens next.This is not the best movie made or a super perfect masterpiece like some reviews are raving, but its the best movie out right now.If there is a second Mad Max movie to be made, this kind of formula and filming would be great for this kind of series.",8,3,9,25 May 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," I Had No Idea The Third Installment Would Be The Worst...
","This has to be one of the worst movies filmed or released in 2011.I have never seen a movie that has no storyline, no plot, bad acting ,cut-shots for no reason,and a action sequence that last 60 minutes make- more than 200million at the box office.It really shows how we as Americans support B.S. Hollywood movies, and kept spending our hard earned money on crap.Michael Bay should really stop making movies...starting today.If you have seen Transformers the first installment of the series, just keep that DVD and play that one over and over.Please erase your mind the other Transformer movies were ever released.I really didn't think the movies would get worst but they did.",1,5,11,16 December 2011
The Martian," A Real Review of The Martain
","After watching the movie the Martain I realized something, this movie is very long.There are good moments in this movie and then there are long drawn out moments too.This movie is good ,not fantastic or the best movie of the year crazy talk. Matt Damon plays the main character great,the supporting cast is good and the plot moves along.The main issues about this movie is the suspense or drama I may say.It seems everything works out to easily from the story on down to the characters themselves.There are times some characters are not used enough during this movie and this causes issues with having feelings towards them.This movie can cause a person to fall asleep during its run time, but they will miss a good movie.",7,1,4,29 November 2015
