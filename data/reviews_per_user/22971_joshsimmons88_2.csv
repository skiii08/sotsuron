The Devil's Advocate," Exceeded my expectations.
","This film exceeded my expectations, that's for sure. I thought the ending was a -little- disappointing, which is why I didn't give this film a 10/10, because it was obvious that reporter was Satan, he gave that away earlier in their discussion, and after all Kevin had been through, it was unrealistic that he wanted to go onto 60 Minutes first thing in the morning, but other than that, it was surprisingly excellent. I already knew Al Pacino was very good, nobody plays Satan as good as him (See 'End of Days') and he still blew me away with his incredible performance. However, I was also surprised at how good Keanu Reeves' acting was in this film! We always knew he was a particularly wooden actor, had trouble showing emotions, but he was amazing in this film. 9/10.",9,4,4,12 January 2011
3:10 to Yuma," Worst ending ever.
","I didn't like the ending to this movie at all, and I can't imagine who would. If you were rooting for the bad guy, you would be disappointed, and if you were rooting for the good guy, you would have also been disappointed. Why? Because Russell Crowe's character is inconsistent; you're either a hardened criminal, who kills people without remorse, or you're a criminal with a conscience, which is not the way this character is developed. However, for some reason, Russell Crowe's character decides to shoot dead his entire gang, including his most loyal gang member who threatened the life of another member who wanted to call it quits in trying to break their leader out of custody. Fair enough, right? Remember when another one of his gang members got caught with his guard down? Russell Crowe's character shot him dead. If you were for the good guy, played by Christian Bale, then you would have been disappointed, because he was shot dead by the gang, leaving his family behind, and it was all for nothing, as Russell Crowe's character was going to escape in the end anyway, because he admitted he had escaped from Yuma twice before, and his horse ran after the train at the end. What the hell? Then what? His character would have escaped and found another crew that he could just execute when he felt like it? Maybe he really did grow a conscious at the end there? He would have just escaped and worked at a supermarket or something, right? Stupid, inconsistent, senseless ending that just boggles my mind. 1/10.",1,12,21,12 January 2011
