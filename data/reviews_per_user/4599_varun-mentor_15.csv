Angels & Demons," Mixed reactions! A&D had some good stuff indeed!
","Let me put a perspective on the movie from a non dan brown reader standpoint.A&D starts with Pope's demise and a series of mishappenings calling for Langdon's entry to demystify the mishappenings and save the Vatican from catastrophe of Antimatter annihilation suspectedly stolen from CERN.No prizes for guessing, Langdon saves the Vatican single handedly by solving all the clues leading towards unearthing the biggest scam in Vatican history.The best part of movie which gave me goosebumps sitting in theater was the breathtaking cinematography. Ron howard's work at its best in capturing the pristine beauty and splendor of various basilica, chapels etc of Rome, Vatican. Story was indeed highly predictable, a racy Hollywood thriller, the movie was very well tightly held but the plot could have been a bit deeper and real.Like the most stupid scenes being one single assassin killing entire group of police officials to execute entire plan on his own. And then after battering every thing that moves, he lets away hanks and zurer quoting stupid reason like you are not carrying weapon so i wont kill you etc.Nevertheless with all the flaws this movie had, i felt in the end, the climax came about to be extremely gripping when you felt movie was about to end and I was about to leave theater after Mckenna was about to selected pope and then twist comes in and langdon again comes to the rescue was very interesting.Overall, there could have been improvements in the film as standards set by ron after giving us legendary films like Beautiful mind (probably the best films ever made and most underrated) and Cindrella Man (another underrated but awe inspiring movie) suggest. But overall the movie was good and i liked it and am gonna think of it for next week or so. 8/10",8,0,1,12 June 2009
L.A. Confidential," Hollywood at its brightest!
","I once rented a pile of movies to watch more than a decade ago maybe when I was in very early teenage. And I am really glad I finally watched that last one from that pile today which at that time I thought was some passable flick. And thankfully more glad because I watched it after Scorsese's masterpiece Departed.Because that way I have the best of both the times. And no comparisons as such could suffice the praise I have for L A Confidential. Movie starts with regular charm any mega movie holds and carries it to sparkling sea of reactions throughout the movie right from goosebumps to a bit of chuckle, nerve wrecking dialogues and masterful performances.And Russell crowe comes to the fore again and again and again (sans Maximus, John Nash, Jim braddock, Ef Hoffman, Jeff Wigand the list is endless). And after all those performances I have seen (although not periodically correct) this truly stands out right next to Maximus for a powerful performance that moves the core inside you. Stands next to him is the topsy turvy Guy Pearce with his grey shaded character which actually make you curse and finally like him in the end. Kim basinger deservedly did a supporting actress performance. Rest of the cast and obviously the most brilliant as a character and an actor Spacey couldn't have made this one into a Hollywood Masterpiece.I wouldn't rewind the story but special mention to the striking dialogues and especially the confessions scene where you can feel yourself breaking the chair Bud is holding and grabbing the goon with his collar thumping him over against the wall and getting the truth outta him. Superb cinema and I wonder what made Curtis Hanson stop right there to continue in the lines of Scorsese who never tends to lose the steam.Overall compelling drama and a MUST watch for real drama lovers, do watch it with no sense of story line and will surprise you at every corner right till the last statement!!! 9/10",9,2,3,20 June 2010
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor Ragnarok is the most enjoyable Marvel flicks after Avengers
","Thor Ragnarok is so much better than other Marvel flicks in years, thanks to wonderfully simple story, brilliantly comic timing and witty dialogues peppered throughout the story. Of course, major credit goes to Chris Helmsworth and Tom Hiddleston chemistry but major surprise comes with Dr Banner aka Mark Ruffalo whose character is very well utilized in the movie. Additional amazingly cameo of witty characters played by Jeff Goldblum and Benedict Cumberbatch are fantastic to the entire scheme of the movie. Tessa Thompson looked ravishing and essayed the part well, however, Cate Blanchett at her evil best is also promising. Thor Ragnarok overall should serve as a benchmark for other forthcoming Marvel movies.",8,12,21,8 November 2017
Knocked Up," The most overrated movie on IMDb
","Gosh, whats wrong with all the people commenting on this movie here! Haven't't they actually seen the movie or do they understand the meaning of Comedy? Haven't they seen apatow's other movies as prod or director, 40 yr old virgin, Ron burgundy, step brothers etc! Knocked up is such a big letdown on comedy genre that hardly anything goes as comedy! There were rarely any moments which could be hilarious or anything closer! the only enjoyable part as always is of Paul Rudd, rest of the things are too bland and do not deserve the kinda commendation it has garnered! Seth rogen started with this kinda roles and got type-casted with the same thing all over there on!",3,3,6,21 August 2009
Interstellar," Interstellar is not just a movie, its a journey beyond the unimaginable! Nolan at his peak.
","It is hard to believe that singular person can transcend so many dimensions across movie making spanning Thriller, Drama, Mystery, Action, Sci-Fi and Comic Fantasy and deliver the finest in each genres. Till few hours before, Gravity was the epic flick which immortalized the Sci-Fi Genre and gave us hope that few can better this, if possible, in near future. While going through the teasers earlier, I was feeling that it might not much up to what Nolan has so far delivered. I went into theater watching this movie without any presumption, which all the more led to more exhilarating experience than I could have imagined.Casting couldn't have been more perfect. Matthew has grown into his elements after the Dallas Buyers Club and this movie has another platform to him for exhibiting his finest connect with the audience. His sensitivity coupled with his power-packed performance was worth every moment in the theater. Anne Hathaway was striking as well along-with other star cast. Special mention to the whole and soul character of the movie, Murph played by Foy and Chastain. The deep interstellar inter-dimensional connect beyond boundaries and imagination of love was astounding to say the least. Coupling the deep theorems of Singularity, Quantum theories, Wormholes, Black holes, Space time and gravitational waves, which to a large extent, would be too complicated for layman intertwined into an emotional saga of humanity and love couldn't have been thought through any better. Movie, a tad bit long, but then again there was too much to tell through the different stages of the movie, so it never leaves your attention for a second. And all of it, the theories and the complications, so damn beautifully converging in the second half to give meaning to every frame in the first half is just ultimate storytelling by the master of the craft. Alfonso Cuaron started the experience for the moviegoers to give insight to intergalactic human interaction and Nolan just takes that cue and hit it for home run right into another galaxy altogether. Without giving too much insight into the movies, Wait for the part where Morse code and binary communication will make it all sensible amidst heaps of relativity and string theories peppered all throughout the movie. This movie is just too much awesomeness for one time view and the thrill it gives, especially when the battle for survival begins is totally unexpected, astounding and awe-inspiring.Just make sure, you don't miss watching this in a life-like theater.",10,0,5,8 November 2014
Man of Steel," Ah well, another Superman gone dud
","I am not sure why people are lapping up blindly rave reviews for this but one thing is for sure, Zack Snyder has lost it. Especially, with the name like Christopher Nolan associated with the movie, it should have been something worth remembering as you move out of theater. But all it turned out was something of a big disappointment.Superman franchise is doomed, from the Brendon Routh to Henry Cavil, each movie has almost left the users gasping for a befitting tribute but hardly comes close to doing justice for the ultimate superhero. I am wondering why Christopher Nolan did not take forth the Superman franchise while he ventured on making Batman to be remembered forever. How many superhero movies before Batman do you remember to be of the stature to be remembered forever. Spiderman came quiet close but not the kind.However, comparing Batman and Superman is totally irrational given they are on different plane altogether. But, at least little sanity is required to digest all that superman has in the store.Man of Steel starts slowly with lot more in detail about Krypton and interplanetary details. Russell Crowe plays stone faced role. Movie then starts complicating the matter with Superman's past and present combined intermittently. Later, second half Zod starts coming in with funny lines and movies ends with 'every beginning has an end' a la matrix kind of fight sequences. It turns out to be such a messy and complicated affair, even star trek darkness or for that matter, the superhero of trivia, Iron Man looks like 100 times better than this movie. Some fight sequences are good given the cgi effects are decent but nothing of the scale of what other movies have achieved for e.g. Avatar or Tron. The sequences looked kind of artificial and even 300 was a better effects movie than this one.Only good parts about the movie were the last fight sequences which was highly predictable and high octane but did justice to the sequences. Lois lane looked old and didn't really set the tone going with Batman. Overall, just a decent start but anyone would have done a better job without complicating the situation so much and making a singular track story without too much venturing into interwoven sequences and pushing cgi deeper than the actual scenes.",7,2,5,18 June 2013
Warrior," Whoa!!! Now this one is a killer for performance!
",Tom Hardy is the man to look for! An absolute marvelous all out performance and performance only driven film. Such strong character buildup that at one point I was so strongly feeling the eventuality to not let happen. I wasn't looking for the final fight to happen as it would mean either of the two protagonist to go down which I was so biased towards both of them at the same time.Tom hardy is a winner here and a must honorable mention for any critical award. Plus I am so looking forward to see what successor of heath ledger is going to perform in the greatest sequel thats gonna be here this year.A definite 8/10,8,0,3,13 January 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Kinda over-hyped but worth one time watch for sure!
","Well, for all the hoopla surrounding this title with book and multiple language remake, I watched the original version of The Girl with Dragon Tattoo. First the good part, Noomi Rapace is a standout performance basically due to her excellent subtle wildness, sexily dark and decent performance as the central character of the film (not necessarily).There are few good scenes with the ones worth mentioning with disturbing and gripping tension between the lawyer and lisabeth along-with the climax where serial brutal murders and the psychology behind the motive is described by the killer.Rest, I would say the brutality shown is uncalled for as it was just a way to forcefully make things more gripping which could have been done either ways by improving the screenplay and adding punch moments. Also, all the talk about the 'hacker' girl doing the stuff had no technical relevance imho for the film although its part of the story originally but it should have been more focused on the finer nuances.Overall, do watch it for some sherlock holmes moment to unearth the mystery which is a result of excellent story.",6,0,1,6 January 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Can anyone please pull the plug on this one? The constant high ratings of Guardian of the Galaxy is such a hoax.
","Although, seeing the trailer and from overall idea about comic series about Guardians of the Galaxy, I realised the film will not be worth watching. But the clowns here in the form of critics giving raving ratings to this franchise is just grossly misleading. I am from India and our film industry is undergoing serious 'Rot' with mind numbingly moronic movies raking moolah on the box office motivating hack of the directors to continue their charades. Same pattern seem to be applying now to Hollywood as well.Last over-hyped movie which almost dragged me to theater was latest CGI megamovie and before that, Godzilla redefined which got good ratings despite being a complete lowdown which I had to walk out post interval.I went inside theater with heavy expectations on my head to watch Guardians of the Galaxy deemed by reviewers here as 'One of the greatest superheroes movies of all time'. Some of the reviewers went ahead and even compared it with Avengers and Dark Knight franchise. For those people, I must comment their shallow wisdom in movie nuances if they compare this franchise with the TDK trilogy. This film turned out to be a torrid dampener from 20 mins into the movie. Too much Sci-Fi, comedic scenes peppered in regular intervals, racoon turning out to be saving grace finally became the most stupid of the characters with Emotional Overdose about a tasteless tree character and a host of other flaws movie had.One glimmer of light came in the film with cinematography when Quills saves Saldana in the space. Apart from that moment, rest was pretty predictable, clichéd, covered mostly in trailers so nothing surprising and overall a highly childish drama on the lines of Frozen which it seems has been rated on IMDb mostly by toddlers. An 8.5+ ranking for such films is ridiculously hilarious and a trap zone for wasting time on riding high expectations.",5,4,11,19 August 2014
3 Idiots," Fantabulous Indian cinema - Slow to digest but overall great appeal
","Well, to start with, lemme clarify, I have a knack of bringing down bollywood cinema being a puritanical movie critic. And the only reason I still hold on to Indian Cinema is Aamir khan. His movies have been the cornerstone of generational behavior through the decades. Indians have experiences the best of reelistic emotions, vigor, love, comedy through the works of Aamir. He defines a supreme talent with an eye for every detail that could connect with the audience in the lightest and most deepest of senses. You will never know what hits you when you watch some of his best works.Moving forward, I went to see 3 idiots with the same expectations from an Aamir movie. Starting with the storyline, it was pretty well presented and starting was glitchy which was readily made up by Aamir's presence, which obviously was staged as such but does make a nice impact. His two sideburns namely Sharman and Maddy did a superb job in their own respective way and special mention to Maddy for his subtle way of bringing the best out of a sidekick role. Another special mention goes to a character names Chatur (dunno the real name) for adding superb comic zing to the movie. Gals were passé but were essential. Some of the scenes were long dragged and kinda unnecessary songs as such a repertoire of bollywood, nevertheless, weighing pros against cons which anyways outnumber the cons, I would like to assure the kind of essence movie brings out as a whole is meaningful and thematic in the most lighthearted and fun filled way.Some of the hilarious scenes were so funny that my friend mentioned it to be the best comic scene in Indians cinema. People might point it out as gross or amateurish but it does forms an essential part of college humor which still is gibberish and kindergarten grade compared to western comedies. Aamir does a fantastic job again maybe not that much as the role he portrays but as an overall feel he brings to any movie he forms a part of. Hirani does bring lot of experiences from his part ventures into this movie but they are well figured out and I must admit, he does belong to the best breed of directors in Indian cinema's current generation with the likes of Imtiaz Ali, Vishal Bhardwaj and Prakash jha, masters in their own genre.Overall movie does give you a fantastic feel as you walk out of the theater and is a perfect gift from Aamir to everyone for Christmas. A must watch for Indian cinema buffs and indeed figures as one of the best recent movies with no award winning stuff but just for the flow it controls the psyche of the audience and brings them through all simple emotions with laughter and grit.3.5/5",Null,6,16,24 December 2009
The Wolf of Wall Street," Roller-coaster ride through the secondary wall street!
","Martin Scorsese's craft is unmatched and he has done it time and again reinventing the protagonists in their career best powerful performances. Obviously, when you have Jack Nicholson as The Departed lead, then the comparisons are pale, but when he picks Leo or Ray Liottas of the world, rest ensured, he is going to secrete the maximum outta lead roles. Going into theater, I had good background information being through with Wall St brokering and trading rooms myself as well Boiler Rooms functioning. I had a decent idea about Belfort's history too and his past and present situations. However, if I just consider this movie from the fictional point of view, I must say its quiet believable but when I correlate the movie in a toned down real events version, I would say, the situations depicted are massively outrageous. And all of this anchored on the towering performance by Leo.Movie starts with Belfort's firm's teaser and is intelligently interwoven with past and present instances. Standing at shy of 3 hours duration, the movie only gets better and better as the time progresses and it is hard to take your eyes off the screen. Best parts of the movie for me were when Belfort addresses this staff on his firm's floor on multiple instances. Screenwriter for this movie researched on Belfort, and put him in a room full of Scorsese's crew to assess the hold of the people Belfort has, that is exactly what has transcended in the performance delivered by Leo during these scenes and its, to say the least, gripping.I am amazed by the performance delivered by Jonah too. He has come a long way from being a rookie performer to a neck to neck performance with lords of the craft. Maybe it is Scorsese effect. Or may be he is getting better too. However, despite the controversies movie is going through, it is a must watch just for the sake of the career best performance by Leo. Rest of the story kinda ultra exaggerates the spiraling out lifestyle portrayed by quick money makers on Wall St. If you really are looking to learn the nuances and inside story of Wall St from 'this' movie, you might be in a wrong theater. ]\",9,1,8,6 January 2014
Inception," When dream becomes your reality! - Sheer brilliance!
","I am still under trance after watching this one few hours back. Let me gather my thoughts and pen my experience down.Movie starts at regular pace and doesn't blow you away like every damn frame of TDK, but when you start rolling with the unfolding of the story, you start connecting the dots of every interpretation metamorphosed in reel through reality. Through the realms of dreams and how you realise everything while dreaming but you cannot do anything because you are subconscious. You start realising how you are dreaming and you cannot realise the inception. You always remember the loop when you wake up and sometimes you are just overwhelmed by the sheer enormity of the dream but in real you cannot even remember it well.Inception is not a flick, its a journey into the realms of the basic human experience, a dream world. Much of it has already been realised to human mind through Lewis carroll and Wachowski brothers, but rest is made into a highly believable concept through the sheer brilliance of Nolan. Nothing I would say here can justify the graciousness moviegoers owe it to him, post memento, tdk, this thing is some hell of a film we will keep remembering like we still remember tumbling down the rabbit hole.I am still under subconscious realisation of the realms of dreams one can experience and for the real stuff, pls do not wait one more second to experience this mindblowing cinematic experience which will make you hold your armrests so tight you will clasp for breath as the climax unfolds and unravels the ultimate concepts in digital movie world.9.9999/10",10,4,9,16 July 2010
The Silence of the Lambs," Mindblowing psycho thriller!!! *spoilers*
","I have seen almost all the major titles in IMDb top 100 but this one stands out on its 17 minutes camera time. All the fans must know what that means, Dr Lecter blows your psyche away with those close face camera shots (superb cinematography, best I have seen), penetrating eyes, unflinching wilfuly crafted dialogs and layer by layer account of psycho analysis of a crime and criminal.I watched this movie last night only and I wasn't able to sleep properly, the intense sequences and the confrontations between lecter and clarice were so dramatic and real, they totally grips your psyche and pulls it deeper and deeper inside the mind of a serial criminal slowly making you believe the thin line dilemma between how criminal a crime could be and the other side of the delusion.Silence of the lambs is mainly about 3 characters, Clarice, Lecter and Bill. Clarice (Foster) is a young FBI agent sent as a curve ball after failed attempts to grill Dr Lecter (Hopkins, hail hopkins, generation after generation will praise thy performance as the greatest screen presence and portrayal of a psychotic cannibal), the motive for which changes gradually in getting Lecter to catch a dreaded serial psychopath killer, lady skinner, Buffalo bill. As the movie progresses, you feel the synchronicity between Clarice and Lecter so amazing, their eyes doing the communication and you reading between the intervention.Especially the escape from prison scene of Dr lecter and initial confrontation of Clarice with Dr Lecter when you get the justification for the title is awesome and mind boggling cinema at its best.My personal favorite: Lecter kills the policemen and then looks up with light focused on his face and his face covered with blood while he tuning his finger to symphony with closed eyes in peace.Kudos Hopkins! 10/10",10,2,3,25 May 2009
The Dark Knight Rises," Fitting finale - Great Storytelling - TDK Best Comic Adaptation, period!!!
","The hysteria surrounding the movie is not unnoticed to anyone around the globe. The massive expectations lay on TDKR after the spectacular prequel. Sitting in the theater you could sense the anxiety and restless till the movie starts.Movie from start to end is gripping and intense. The first half will keep you wanting for more and more and the second half is where you are going to realize the greatness. The movie is made of powerful yet flawed script. The different stories and plots intertwined together flow like a symphony. It is a mark of a legendary filmmaker to provide an amazing ending. That is where, the TDKR provides you maximum punch. You have to wait till the very last sequence to realize its greatness. Not just a movie it is, TDKR is a tribute to legendary movies. TDKR is the swan song of Nolan who has showed to the world that brilliance is not a fluke. He has done it from the Memento till TDKR, movie after movie. And he never tires. Like a hardened diamond, he only shines brighter. After watching the movie, you will realize the stark reality thrown in our faces trivializing the brilliantly psychotic but true rants of Heath in TDK against 'civilized society'. Truly sad and appalling tragedy surrounds the movie now. TDKR launch has been doomed with the Aurora Tragedy and legend lives on. Just like Gotham, we the people require an invisible hero who could turn around a catastrophe to its self annihilation. World is in terrible chaos and TDKR doesn't stand a movie anymore but a strong message that Justice has a face unlike the masked evil.Christian Bale provides a much needed respite and towers above all the characters in the movie. TDK is when he was clearly overshadowed by the greatest piece of performance in cinematic history, ever. But this movie is all his to portray his best. Amazing and powerful performance by the man, the Batman. I wonder what is he is like in real life, like Bruce Wayne, Batman or American Psycho. Such wide range of character this man has played. Amazing feat to pull this off with perfection especially the parts which required his best to come out and he delivered. Script has been written in such a way to extract his emotional and angry side. And so does Bale notches up to finish the greatest trilogy in English Cinema apart from obviously, the LOTRs and the Bournes'.Rest nothing much to do for Alfred and Fox but yes, three major characters that are going to stay with you are played by Hathaway, Cotillard and Levitt. Levitt just like Cotillard is of Nolan's camp. And thus must be delivering a powerful performance if they are figuring in back to back blockbusters by the master. As the movie progresses, both Levitt's and Cotillard's characters mature and the ending of the movie packs the amazing surprise which is gonna enthrall the audience. And above all sideys, the best of them is Catwoman - Hathaway. And what a characters she has built, sheer power and Grey shades character.Bane on the other hand is a decent villain but how much ever I might try, I am not getting over the fact that I can't see his expressions at all. All I can see is a big man trying to scare. Overall, if you are sitting in theater and waiting to see the better movie than TDK, please don't put yourself in position of disappointment. TDK is the de-facto standard of Hollywood best comic book adaptation ever and ever immortalized by the great Heath. That happened once and ain't gonna ever happen again. But if you watch TDKR without comparison, you are gonna have a time of your life.For the franchise purpose, for delivering we the people, a treat for the lifetime to sit back and watch the legend unfold, thank you so much Mr Nolan.<ul><li>10/10</li></ul>",10,2,7,20 July 2012
Deadpool," What is with so much hype? Deadpool is a decent movie but it ain't any earth shattering epic!
","Given so much hype had been garnered for this movie, it built so much enthusiasm in me that got me in theater with high expectations. However, as the movie progressed, the anticipation, the enthusiasm started fading away and gave way to restlessness to finish the relentless ordeal.Deadpool in parts is a good movie, it has neatly done action sequences, good cgi and nice humour thrown in between along the way. Reynolds looks fab when within the suit (pun intended). However, everything to do with real guy outta suit is too tad dragging, especially for a superhero movie, I have never witnessed such a dragging back story which did not hold any interest for even a tiny second.Further, the story overall is totally lackluster. Sequencing of the movie is non linear which kinds of takes away the fun sometimes. Antihero played by another mutant is a damp squib with snore worthy ending. After a certain point, all the humor which was holding the movie in first few minutes of the movie starts becoming drab.I have seen reviewers even comparing this movie with TDK and other superhero flicks. Its sad to see the herd mentality over so much hype for the movie which at best deserves a mediocre praising for its cgi, fight sequences, actress and overall attempt to bring out a kickass-as-an-adult comic book caper movie.",6,6,18,15 February 2016
