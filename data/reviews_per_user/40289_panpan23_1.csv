The Blair Witch Project," A great film experience
","This movie was such a great concept and such a great delivery.  I think that people who didn't like it and were expecting more are too wrapped up in bad Hollywood special effects movies to appreciate a really scary movie (such people are the same people who don't appreciate the terror in the shower scene in 'Psycho.'  They look at it and say, ''s not scary.'Anyway, I think that to really appreciate this movie is to buy the 2-tape set of the movie and the 'Curse of the Blair Witch.'  Watch 'Curse' first and then the movie and allow yourself to believe this really happened because that is what makes the movie horrifying.  I sat in the theater feeling terrified ... not because 'something was going to happen,' but because I felt lost along with these kids.  And yeah, I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did, the last shot of the movie just stayed with me ... I can picture it now and it scared the hell out of me.  Of course, you have to pay attention to all the back story to know why it's scary.  And what it does is it leads you to question the existence of the witch and the validity of the 'legend' the movie is created around.Oh, one more comment.  Somebody wrote a review wondering why they didn't take cell phones into the woods and another person wondered how all their electronic equipment stood the test of time.First, the electronic equipment, if you followed the back story, was found in an undisturbed archaeological site.  In other words ... something put it there, but what (the mystery deepens).Second, on cell phones.  The movie takes place in 1994.  That's important for a reason besides the fact that they have been gone for so long.  It wasn't until after the 1996 telecommunications bill was passed that smaller cellular companies and smaller local/long-distance companies started popping up.  In other words, cell phones have been around, but have only been in such widespread use by COLLEGE STUDENTS in the last 3-5 years ... after the movie.  And besides, do you honestly think that they'd be able to get service all the way out in the woods?",Null,0,1,28 July 2000
