The Blair Witch Project," Might have been scary, but all I felt was nausea!
","This is one film I won't be watching again. I actually quite like the idea, however I found the characters annoying and was hoping they would die by the end. The thing that really spoiled it for me most was the fact that by about half way through I began to feel nauseous from the shaking camera work. Once I broke out in a sweat I decided that I best close my eyes to avoid chucking on the people in front. This kind of spoilt the scariness for me.On the other hand most people I know didn't feel like puking so it seems that I had a relatively rare experience.",6,0,0,14 December 1999
