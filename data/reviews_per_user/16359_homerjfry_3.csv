The Ring," Great Suspense and Tension
","I saw this movie on a sneak preview and was not expecting much. After the first 10 minutes I thought i was sitting and watching another crappy teen horror movie, but i was very wrong. This movie was perhaps one of the most well done suspenseful movies in recent memory. I never get scared during crappy horror movies, but this one had me on the edge of my seat. There was some disturbing imagery, and had scenes that were stuck in my head for days to follow. It rivals 'Signs' as one of great suspense movies as of late, and i think even surpasses 'Signs' in that regard. The tension is great, added even more so by a countdown of sorts. It is a phenomenal, tension filled movie that will scare the bejesus out of more people watching it. Very well done movie.",9,0,0,5 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Star Wars is Back
","I saw Episode 2 today, and i must say that i was truly impressed with this effort. After seeing Episode 1, i was greatly disappointed in the plot, and the casting (Jake Loyd was probably the worst Star Wars casting ever, well maybe next to N'Sync) and the amount of crappy religious elements in it. There were many scenes that could have been edited out of it such as the underwater part where they are being chased by that fish. The emaculate conception crap was laugh out loud funny in its lameness as well. I think that Lucas has listened to all the complaints from fans and tried to address them, and for the most part he suceeded. Jar-Jar actually serves a purpose in this film, and Hayden Christianson is very strong as Anakin Skywaker. He plays the role with anger, and saddness, pulling the viewer in to his struggle. Sure he is whiney, but he is also playing like a 17 year old kid so that is fine by me. He has a look about him that seems to scream evil, and he is very good in this role. Ewen McGregor is strong as well as Obi Wan. He really adds a lot to the role. His performance was very good, and he seemed to have that auora of Obi Wan greatness around him. Natalie Prtman was weak as Padame' as her performance was kind of bland and cookie cutter. Although she was the most beautiful i have ever seen her. She was gorgeous. This movie really set up the future of the Star Wars universe such as introducing the storm troopers instead of the droids. The Droids in the first movie really bugged me, as i wanted to see Strom Troopers. I was happy to see them introduced, but was shocked at their role in the movie. There were some complaints such as the Jedi were made to look like weaklings. I will not reveal how, but you will see when you watch the movie. Most of them are just pushovers. I think they tried to hard to make humour with C3PO and R2D2 and a lot of the time it didn't work. It ended up being rather lame. The fight that Yoda had was cool in the beginning, but the more i thought about it, the more laughable it was. I was chuckling when i was watching it because it was pretty outrageous. My final complaint being that Obi Wan was kind of shown to be a loser, as Anakin was correcting him and making him look stupid, and he was getting beaten up a lot, but i guess it is ok because Anakin is suppossed to be the bad ass of the universe.I was not disturbed with Jimmy Smits, as i thought i would be. He was cool in his role. Chancellor Palpatine and Count Dooku were cool as well, as the dark Jedi badasses they are. I was happy to see an amazing battle with Jedi, and droids and troopers. The last half an hour will make up for Episode one ten fold. I enjoyed this movie beter than Spiderman, as the 'love' theme didn't bother me nearly as much in this movie as it did in Spiderman. I was shaking my head during Spiderman because it was so cliche'd and lame with all the 'I love you crap.' There is some lameness in this movie too, but for the most part it was cool, and nice to see.This movie is really some eye candy. The city in the beginnng of the movie is pure beauty, and amazing to watch. When i think about the complaints of this movie, that it is not as good as the originals, and i agree (although i liked this movie better than the first Star Wars). But think about this. These movies have a lot of back story to deal with. And it is hard to cram all of this story together, and make everyone happy. Plus wouldn't you rather the middle movies be the best? I would. They are still amazing to watch today, and i think there is no way to compare them to these. Lucas had a lot more to work with on Episodes 4, 5 and 6, and in these movies he is more limited in his material.It still bothers me that the ships in these movies look a lot better than the ships on the original trilogy, but there are cool precursors to the AT-ATs and Star Destroyers in this movie. As well as a cameo from the 'secret weapon.' All in all i had a blast watching this movie. This was a feeling that i haven't had for a long time. The final battle was incredible, and everything else was amazing to watch. The story really develops as well as Anakin's character (A cool side note my friend pointed out was that Anakin's clothes get darker as the movie progresses) and i can't wait for Episode 3. Episode 2 gave me 'A New Hope' for the series. A great movie, that is amazingly fun to watch and experience. Great Job Lucas and Company. You have me waiting eagerly until 2005. P.S. Anyone who says 'Return of the Jedi' is the best Star Wars movie, isn't a real Star wars fan. We all know it is the 'Empire...' that is the greatest.",7,0,0,16 May 2002
Mulholland Drive," A Masterpiece of Mystery
","It's been a long time since I have seen a movie that made me think this much. Perhaps I have never seen a movie that made me feel this way, but at long last I have, and I am glad I did.  There hasn't been a director since Hitchcock that has made such thought provoking, mysterious pieces, that pull every string in your mind, and doesn't let go. The only difference is that Hitchcock told you the secret, whereas is seems that Lynch  keeps it to himself. He leaves it up to the watcher to figure out what happened, like a detective solving a case. It reminds me of Robert Forester's character in this same movie. He is on screen for about 2 minutes, and it is like we are playing his role, trying to unravel this mystery. All the clues are there, we just have to look hard enough. I know what the ending meant and all that stuff (it required assistance as I only figured out half of it on my own), but it didn't matter if I ever found out because the movie was still enjoyable, and attempting to figure out what happened is most of the fun. Lynch takes us on this wild ride, and t just gets wilder at the end. Who is real? Who isn't? Are people what they appear to be? The answer is no. The details of this movie hung with me the whole day after I saw it, and i spent the entire time trying to piece together what happened myself, and it was a blast. I only hope more writers/directors are talented enough to deliver a genuinely chilling, mystery such as this wonderful film. Watching this movie was creepier than watching any of those crappy 'horror' movies out there. And it was nice to see Lynch get a nod from the Academy for this brilliant work, even though he didn't win. A wonderful movie, with a wonderful cast and an amazing ride.",9,1,1,6 May 2002
