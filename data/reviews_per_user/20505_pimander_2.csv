Black Swan," Feathers
","I came to this with high expectations, and about half of the way through the film I started shuffling my feet, shifting, grimacing, and muttering 'sheesh!' under my breath. The film is about as lacking in nuance as Nina is lacking in sensuality. And heavy handed on the symbolism. The story could have been such a good one! Unfolded with so much subtlety. A young, virginal girl, uptight and perfectionist, cracks under the strain of performing as prima ballerina in Swan Lake, under the demanding glare of her trainer and the smothering influence of a mother who infantilizes her. That ghastly pink bedroom. She must learn to convey the sensuality and evil of the Black Swan in the ballet as well as the fragility and innocence of the White Swan, into which she has been turned (through a curse) in both legend and in worldly ambition. She must learn, in effect, what she has never known-- sexual passion, and to this extent the movie was fairly good. Dancing and sex aren't so anxiously associated for no reason.However, it wasn't clear to me why choreographer chose this brittle virgin for the part, taking an enormous risk in an enormous spotlight when it was clear that she wasn't up to her sensual counterpart, that she was increasingly unstable, and I got tired of the constant rehearsals where this was pointed out. SPOILER: the moment we've been waiting for is magnificent, and magnificently portrayed by.... / / / / a metamorphosis on stage where she literally turns into a great black bird: the itching she feels and the scratches she tries to cover up are in fact the passionate nature she represses. But the filmmaker insisted on bludgeoning us with horror-film clichés and violence ad nauseam (literally... we see her vomit three times, suffer hallucinations where she is ripping her skin off, stabbing someone with a shard of glass, watching while a former ballerina gouges her face with a nail file, etc. etc.). The horror genre has already been there done that with the clichés about the distortions in the mirror, the blood in the bathroom sink, the startling appearance of a reflection or worse. None of this needed to be so over the top or so derivative. The mother and the cruel fellow dancers was enough. I prefer magic realism to horror. It's an entirely different approach to film, and it was done to so much better effect in The Fountain. Best Picture? HARDLY!!",4,17,39,19 December 2010
Interstellar," See this film only at an IMAX because the soundtrack DESTROYS the dialog.
","After I went with a group of angry people to the manager at our local Cinemark, I found out how they show films in the non-IMAX theaters (the 3D IMAX was sold out) and, for that matter, at most non-IMAX complexes: on something like a thumb-drive projected hugely. This guarantees that there's no way to mix the sound. Everything's at the same level. So while I was watching this visually gorgeous film, my whole body vibrating with the force of the sound coming out of the speakers, I couldn't understand a freaking thing spoken during most of the movie. Consequently, I missed the SPOILER! uttered during the SPOILER! that revealed the important plot point SPOILER! that would have shaped my understanding of the SPOILER! Added to that, McConaughey, sexy as he is, mumble/whispers everything he says, and the dialog was transmitted mono-levelly with the score--which knocks you out of your seat--so if the film is ever released on DVD it had better come with subtitles. And since lift-off the 'Gargantuan' music doesn't let up for about two hours. I like Nolan's films, but his choice of sound crew for this one was pretty poor, and it might sink his chances at the Oscars. Either that or he/they don't have any idea how the normal viewer watches a film in a regular theater (on a thumb drive). The plot was great, what I could gather from it, the visuals were fantastic, but I give an F minus to the sound. There is absolutely NO need for important dialog to be taking place during ear-splitting electronic music especially when they're trying to engender awe in you at the expense of idea. Even the tender, whispered, crucial-to-the-story, bed-side SPOILER! could only be partially understood by lip-reading. Go see it in an IMAX where they can adjust the multiple levels. We got our money back, and I wish you a better experience.",Null,1,3,8 November 2014
