Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A future remake
","This one was wrong from the beginning. But with some new story structure and good writing (and deleted characters) it could be good.One day they should remake all these movies using computer generation (ohh..40 years from now) and make them good for 15 and up, instead of OK for someone under the age of 2 that they are now.I love the star wars world and there are lots of possibilities here, just need to stick to the basics character development and use the right characters.More models and real sets. More models that blow up. THey should have duel in a forest of super high ancient tree (representin wisdom and age) and darth maul cuts off limbs of the trees and cuts one completely down to get OB! and QUigonn off. The final battle is over a waterfall with ledges in a clearing. Guidonn dies, ob1 kills Darth maul, or darth maul runs away for later meeting in part 2.",Null,0,4,4 October 2011
