The Blair Witch Project," Then why did so many critics love it then, huh?
","The one thing the haters of this film never want to deal with is this one question: why did so many good movie critics universally hail TBWP as such a great horror film? The college, frat boy crowd who hate this film cannot give an answer, unless they admit that their is some collective insanity that made every important critic in the country get scammed by this so-called bad movie. You and I both doubt this, so this must mean that either you cannot fathom a decent horror movie, or you are sold on the premise that only computer animation and boo/gore effects make a horror movie shine.This is one of the great horror movies of all time, not because of the look of the film, but because of the smart idea of the making of the film and the way the inspiration of the amateur actors seem to gel so completely, almost too perfectly. Everything seemed to work right, even though so much could have gone wrong. The looks on the actors faces, the real fear and real anger made for a great movie, that could have been the bad movie, talentless detractors think it is.Here is why this movie works so well:The experimental nature could have made the film fail, or not be as interesting, but the actors real uncomfortability with the woods and the things that happen make for a real experience, when it could have looked hooky and planned. Without even suspending disbelief, you never thought the movie was fake. It seemed like these were real college kids looking for a witch. You felt their REAL fear, you felt the cold, could sense your own fear and it made you uncomfortable in a way that is seldom seen in horror films. This is a real experience, that goes beyond campfire fun. The horror, that hides in the shadows seems more real, because you feel it. Most horror movies are fun, but this film is too creepy to be the usual fun horror experience. That is what makes haters hate, they do not want to deal with their own discomfort, about this film, and what it did to them.The acting is real. They could have been tongue tied, or had shitty words coming from their mouths, but they did do a smashup job and coming up with plausible dialogue. You have to give it to them, since they had so little to work with.Odd things happen in the film that help the plausibility of the story seem more real. I will not divulge them, but you lovers of this film know what I mean. The directors got very lucky in what happen in the woods. So much could have gone wrong, but didn't.The greatness of this film is not about art--the film is actually not art at all. It is an experiment that works. Look at it that way and give it another try. Put yourself into the shoes of the campers. Maybe the fear will make more sense.The haters of this film merely show their ignorance. You would have to be blind or idiotic to hate this monumental horror classic. For shame.",10,2,5,6 October 2005
