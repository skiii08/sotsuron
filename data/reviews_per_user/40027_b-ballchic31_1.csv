The Legend of Bagger Vance," Why isn't this movie more popular
","Perhaps I am the only person that really understood this movie. Perhaps I m feel a certain nostalgia for the movie because I miss Jack Lemon. Regardless, this is one of those movie that I just plain do no understand why it is not more popular, or why it wasn't better received. And I'm not giving it high praise because of its' wonderful cast and superb director, but because it was also a great story. It's a story that should make the viewer sit back and ponder for a bit before dismissing it. The movie was perfectly shot, and is just gorgeous. Matt and Will and Charlize were great. I loved the movie so much, that when I left the movie theater I would have bet big money it would have been nominated for an Oscar, and how wrong I was. Sadly, this movie made no money, and I wanted to post a good comment regarding it after seeing Matt on Late Night saying how it flopped. It's always the really good movies that seem to lose it's luster behind the big budget blockbuster.",9,1,3,30 July 2004
