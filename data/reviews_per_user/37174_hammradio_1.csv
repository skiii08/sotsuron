Casablanca," Nearly a Perfect Movie
","I watched this movie again just the other day.  A viewer today might be jaded, because half of the lines of the movies are cliches in today's world. But still this movie stands the test of time.  The Shakespearian tragic hero Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) battles the Nazi's and double-crosses the French to set his true love free.  This sacrifice makes this the greatest love story of all time.  Drama, historical significance, smart dialogue, action and humor.  If you wanted to make the perfect movie, you have to use Casablanca as a map.  Wonderful.",10,1,1,9 June 2000
