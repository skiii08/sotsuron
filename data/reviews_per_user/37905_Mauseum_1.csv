War Dogs," Pretty sure I've seen this before...
","I'm not going to harp on about this movie much, just go and watch Lord Of War (2005) and you'll enjoy it more than this movie (thank me later). This movie lacks any major character development (beyond that they like drugs and making money) and it's so boring in its presentation that I was just waiting for the moment they would eventually get caught. The acting is not up to much either, basically cut them their cheques and move on. Jonah Hill just plays the same role he's been doing for about 10 years now and it's getting a little boring. You can tell he's got some skills, such as in Moneyball but we just never really get to see it. Anyway, the true story of War Dogs is far more interesting and amazing and is worth looking up.",3,3,6,8 July 2017
