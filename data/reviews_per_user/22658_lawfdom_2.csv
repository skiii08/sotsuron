The Devil's Advocate," The Devil made me do it.
","How many times do we do something wrong and rather than take personal responsibility we find an excuse, usually, 'the devil made me do it'? This compelling story about an attorney who must win at all cost shows that man is not some puppet being controlled by an invisible force. We have choice and can choose good or evil. Our choice depends on our motivation, on our prerogative, usually, what is best for 'me'. God and the Devil, aware of this human trait, exploit it to their enjoyment. What else do you think they do for fun? No matter what choice we make God or the Devil wins. There are only two choices in life, good or evil. We must choose one. The one great thing about this film, is that it re-asserts for me that we are never forced by God or Satan to act. We are merely presented with opportunities and we take our pick. Perhaps God and the Devil keep score. I believe they are very competitive in nature but would not go as far as to choose for us. There would be no fun in that now, would there? One of the best films of all times.",9,6,10,3 February 2005
Us," Has Potential, but...
","Mostly entertaining, scary at times, but ends with a dud. It's frustrating when it's hard to figure out what a story is trying to say, especially one that is caused by deliberate psychological manipulation.",6,1,1,26 March 2019
