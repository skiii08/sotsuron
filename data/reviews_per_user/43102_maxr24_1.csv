Sucker Punch," Sucker Punch is an offensive piece of garbage.
","This film is the biggest slap in the face the movie industry has ever experienced. I actually found this movie offensive. I came out of the theater to find myself highly frustrated with my experience and I wondered why. Here are the reasons:Sucker Punch does not try to be a movie. I've seen worse acting, screenplay, direction, soundtrack, etc. in other films. But those were entertaining! They were humorous because somebody tried to make a movie and failed miserably at it. It was funny the same way Americas Funniest Home Videos is funny. Snyder, on the other hand, did not try. He deliberately threw enough money to feed a third-world country for a year at a collection of high-tech YouTube videos and then gloated when the revenues from idiot moviegoers like me kicked in. At least for that, I want to punch him in the face.Yes, the visual effects are alright. The women, while definitely not the hottest on the planet, are relatively attractive. But the mere fact that this was a piece of eye candy with no intention of being anything else is disrespectful. If this paragraph is making the reader think 'Hey, hot women and cool visual effects, I should watch this', I have a piece of advice for you. Play World of Warcraft and then watch some porn. These things are much more fulfilling separately, when developed for what they are meant to be. Snyder mates the two to produce a retarded, disturbing child called Sucker Punch.I feel no need to go into the plot or the quality of the acting in great detail. The plot seems to have been conceived by throwing every single thing that is defined as 'cool' by moviegoers with an average IQ of 35 and sprinkling it with a disastrous attempt at being inspirational to the 14-yearold emo girl audience. The acting made me feel like the movie is a trial to see how long I can last before throwing something at the screen. I failed that challenge about 35 minutes in.Finally, I'll mention that this movie had absolutely nothing original about it. No, I don't mean that it didn't tickle your brain in a particular way or that it didn't make you reanalyze the point of your existence. I mean that every single darned concept of this movie has been done somewhere before â€“ and done much better. Sucker Punch is the cacophony of film.In short, Sucker Punch is pure garbage. Please, don't watch this film.",1,20,45,29 March 2011
