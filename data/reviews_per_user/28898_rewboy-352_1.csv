Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," bonnerificnessaboodle!!
","It is bonnerific! It is Like they took a documentary and showed it to a group of teenagers and added everything they said... also has some historical meaningin the film and tought me a little bit of history while i didn't notice and it is probably the first film I've come out of saying 'there is nothing i can add to that to make it better.' Literally speechless and shivered with excitement the whole way through the film, Loads of gore and in 3d its much more exciting, i love it and cant wait for it to come out on DVD, it will be on repeat for the next year Yum. Definitely go see it as soon as you can it is well worth it and teenagers will love it",10,4,8,27 June 2012
