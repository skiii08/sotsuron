Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas is a God, Wake up Jack Asses
","A Phantom Menace is the picture of the year and the best movie ever.  All of the characters should be up for oscars and the screen play and the special effects should win without a doubt.Many people have said that Jar Jar Binks is annoying, but that is what he is supposed to be. He is intended to be a foolish character in order to give you breaks from the more serious scenes of the movie.  This is what great directors are able to do, combine foolishery with perfection.  I can find no complaints about this movie and feel it is perfection.  It ties together everything in the starwars universe and shows many awesom starwars charecteristics that everyone knows but have not seen in 15 years.  In fact, Phantom Menace is better than the other three starwars movies, for the simple fact that there are no flaws.  However the other movies have many flaws",10,0,0,20 May 1999
