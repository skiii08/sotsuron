Hereditary," A definite 'WTF' type of movie!!
","My son & I were excited to see 'Hereditary' especially after all the reviews. We went Thursday 7 June & were severely disappointed with movie. The story line is very flimsy and at the end of the movie, we both look at each other and said spontaneously 'WTF!'. The movie is 2 painstakingly hours long. It really isn't a 'Must see' movie.",1,264,540,9 June 2018
