The King's Speech," Quite remarkable
","This Movie exemplifies how well the Brits. do history, in that their attention to detail is quite remarkable in visuals, characters,etc. The story of the King's problem was known by some, but this film brilliantly depicts the long hard journey he had to follow to overcome his disability. The acting by Colin Firth ensures an Oscar, while Geoffrey Rush was outstanding in a role that stretched his ability to represent the original Mr. Logue. Characters of the time like Churchill, King George V, Chamberlain, etc were truly captured, and it would be unfair not to mention Guy Pearce in the unsympathetic role of Edward VIII. In summing up, one can only rate this film very clearly the best of the Year.",10,0,1,15 February 2011
The Monuments Men," A real let-down.
","I really looked forward to seeing this Film, and regret to say that it was a large disappointment. The story (purported to be true, but clearly over the top!) was poorly scripted, with far too much relying on clever quips, the actors tried to make this believable, but when saddled with some outrageous scenes like the one with the horse, reality went out the window. The best acting came from Cate Blanchett and Hugh Bonneville (so far from Downton Abbey), while Matt Damonseemed to be missing in 75% of the story. It also appeared as if the Cigarette companies sponsored the Movie. There is no question that it will make money, due solely to the names of the Stars, but it certainly misses out in true entertainment and interest.",5,0,0,7 April 2014
Captain Phillips," Harrowing but true
","Despite several people telling me not to bother going to see this film as it was predictable, I went anyway and thought it was quite brilliantly done. True, it was predictable if you knew the story, but to see the re-enactment of the whole sorry situation was a very great experience. The staging was brilliant and the acting by those portraying the Somalis was an eye-opener...the scenes in the lifeboat were harrowing (maybe a bit too drawn out insofar as the film was concerned) but the movie certainly showed how Americans rightly protect their own. Tom Hanks really had to act brilliantly in the last half of the film, after a very standard sort of role in the first half. I felt it was 15 to 20 minutes too long, but also a very good film",8,1,3,19 November 2013
Skyfall," Bond and 'M' - a great pair.
","I have read most of the previous reviews of 'Skyfall', and it makes one realize just how wide are our preferences where Movies are concerned. I felt this is the best Bond movie in a long time, being full of fast-moving (at times impossible) action, and was pleased to see the wonderful Judi Dench as 'M' having a much bigger role than usual, and Daniel Craig doing a great job as Bond, though I do think he is starting to show his age and that will be of concern to the producers. The settings like Shanghai were absolutely wonderful, as was the strong finale in beautiful Scotland. Plaudits go to Xavier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes and the newcomer who played 'Q'. In a nutshell, it was great fun.",8,2,9,20 February 2013
Casablanca," Two letters of Transit = Complete Entertainment
","This film has to be the most talked about movie ever, and yet when you look at it, there are so many holes in the story, but who really cares, when the entertainment contained in 100 minutes is so great.  I must admit that I still do not know after 60 years how ' two letters of transit' enabled anyone to escape as did Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid, but again, why bother about such a minor detail.  The aforementioned stars, along with Humphrey Bogart entered into the mood from the start, and brought us one of the best movies ever.  The supporting cast, particularly Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet and Conrad Veidt were spot on, and added so much to it. Michael Curtiz did a wonderful job as director, while the black and white photography added so much to it.   I still shudder when I think how Jack Warner was considering Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan for the main roles.",10,2,3,22 July 2004
Lone Survivor," Bravery beyond belief!
","When this film began, I feared that I was going to be disappointed...but I was so wrong. The opening sequences certainly set the tone of what was to follow. The acting and setting of the war in Afghanistan came across as 100% believable, and it brought home the bravery of Navy Seals under unimaginable conditions. I am not an American, but was so in awe of the bravery of the real people who are honored in 'Lone Survivor'. Mark Wahlberg grows in every movie he appears, and is brilliant, as is Taylor Kirsch as his superior officer. Good to see Eric Bana too. I must disagree with another reviewer who felt the credits at the end were not suitable - I felt they added quite brilliantly to the veracity and emotion of a very fine Movie. I fully recommend seeing it-",9,1,5,11 March 2014
Argo," Gripping throughout
","First of all, it must be said that Ben Afflect has re-created (and added a bit of fantasy) a situation that gripped the world. He has done this with real imagination, great sets, brilliant acting and an atmosphere that catches all viewers without any slow or boring spots. To add to this , his acting performance as Mendez in first-rate. When doing a review it is usually fashionable to find fault (even to the extent of childish nit-picking), but that is not possible with this truly exciting story of an attempt to rescue American Embassy officials from Iran. Afflect's direction is firm and controlled, and his Movie must be a contender at the Oscars for Best Picture. Do not miss this one!",9,1,3,30 October 2012
Alexander," Saga well done , but far too long!
","This film featured the best and worst for any audience, the worst being it was dragged out for too long and was very wordy - particularly the Anthony Hopkins parts (he was brilliant, as usual, but far too verbose!) - the best were the brilliant scenes of battle, the scenery, and I am delighted to say that the acting was very good. Colin Farrell was a big surprise as Alexander - he did very well (even tho he sometimes fell into his own accent!), while Val Kilmer was unrecognisable, Angelina Jolie was beautiful (but her love of snakes disturbing) and Jared Leto was very effective. How true to History, I do not know, but that is somewhat irrelevant to me providing it is entertainment, and this was that on a grand scale. There is no doubt that Alexander the Great was one of the finest Soldiers of all time, but somehow this was lost a bit in the telling. I do recommend it, as I consider it a very worthwhile effort that must be seen on the big screen.",6,0,2,10 February 2005
Troy," Not historically right, but Oh! what a spectacle
","Critics can clearly argue with the rights and wrongs of the story in its depiction of history, but the film as sheer entertainment is brilliant. Though it lasts for nearly three hours, it did not drag at all, and the cast was extremely good, with particular emphasis on the part played by Peter O'Toole - as always quite brilliant.  Brad Pitt as Achilles played his part very well, and I felt his acting has improved considerably over the years. Eric Bana was really the star performer among the leads, and while he had some fairly ordinary lines to say, he did so with conviction. Bloom as Paris was passable, with not a lot to do for most of the movie.  The 'Trojan Horse' sequence was well done, but seemed to be over a bit too quickly as it was after all supposed to be the real climax to the story.  All in all, a very good spectacle that did not disappoint from an entertainment viewpoint.",9,1,3,6 July 2004
Ed Wood," Depp and Landau are standouts.
","The era and efforts of the worst Director ever, Ed Wood, have been very well recreated in this movie, and the acting of Johnny Depp as the title character and Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi are quite remarkable and the latter clearly deserved his Best Supporting Actor Award. Depp seems to be able to take on the most outlandish of roles, and make them not only, believable, but truly memorable, and that us very much the case in 'ED WOOD'. It is possible, or even probable, some of the events depicted may never have occurred, but it was entertaining and gave a good insight to the Hollywood of that era. I was most surprised to see Bill Murray and Sarah Jessica Parker being cast, and in their somewhat 'weird' roles they carried them off very effectively. The ending, where the film reveals what happened to all the characters made for a very interesting conclusion.",8,3,3,7 September 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Spectacular vision, but still a bummer!
","With all the $ that have gone into this movie for the computer graphics, one would have thought that the producers could have purchased a slightly believable script to go with them!.. The story is atrocious, so far-fetched and unbelievable, that I found it hard to enjoy the spectacular vision generated by computer technology. The ridiculous story line was so out of whack, that the audience when I attended the movie were laughing outright which clearly destroyed any chance of it being a successful film.   There were so many errors in the geography of the film, plus completely unrealistic and nigh impossible rescue situations that leaves you wondering 'why bother?'  The ship floating down the street, missing buildings, was a real 'hoot'.  The actors tried very hard, with Ian Holm being the true professional, but with that story line, I am amazed they could keep a straight face!",4,0,1,6 July 2004
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Not one for the masses.
","I know I am in the minority, but I have just come out of seeing this Film, and , not having read the book, I am completely confused as it jumped from scene to scene introducing numerous new characters, who then disappeared and no real explanation of why the things that happen do happen. The acting is excellent, but one feels if this how MI6 operated during the Cold War, it is wonder that more serious events did not occur. The photography is good, even though most of the buildings, inside and out, were drab, dirty and colorless. A number of relationships were hinted at, but not pursued causing more confusion. Gary Oldman was excellent in a demanding role, and he and his assistant, Peter, were the redeeming features in an overlong, dreary and confusing movie.",4,13,25,7 February 2012
The Aviator," deCaprio and Blanchett are triumphant
","To all who are going to go and see this movie, please keep an open mind beforehand, as it is the story of only a part of Howard Hughes' life and cannot be expected to cover his entire life and career. However, what it does cover is done superbly, and for this, thanks must go to Leonardo de Caprio (absolutely brilliant as Hughes) and Cate Blanchett (who fully deserved her Oscar as Katharine Hepburn) in particular - they are brilliant, and once again de Caprio builds on his stunning performances in 'Gangs of New York' and 'Catch Me If You Can' - the very complex Hughes would have been a real challenge for anyone, but de Caprio nailed it. The supporting cast which includes Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Kate Beckinsale (as Ava Gardner) and Jude Law (he even looks like Errol Flynn) are all fascinating performances - do not let some critics deter you from Seeing 'The Aviator' - it is long but intriguing, but, boy oh boy, what a place Hollywood must have been in the 30's.",8,0,0,23 March 2005
The Bourne Identity," Read the Book then see the Movie!
","Having read the Book, I felt the Movie was going to be a serious let-down - it was just the opposite for me.  It was engrossing from the very start and held your interest the whole way through, and I cannot envisage missing the sequel 'The Bourne Supremacy'.   The scenery was spectacular at all locations while the performance of Matt Damon was really good - he was excellent in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' and he followed that up extremely well here.  The supporting cast of all relative unknowns did first-class jobs.  This is a classic case of where it was better to see the Film after having read the Book.  I have just read some of the 'goofs' printed about this Movie, which, in hindsight was a mistake as one tends to watch out for them, rather than enjoying the entertainment for what it is.",8,2,2,24 July 2004
Gone with the Wind," A Magnificent Film that stands the test of time!
","So much has been written about this film, that was made so many years ago, and that in itself should show just how great it was. Brilliantly cast and photographed, it still stands very high among the best films ever made. Sure there was a huge amount of publicity for it when first released, but it was well merited. Just look at the cast - Vivien Leigh was the ideal choice and if you care to think about today's actresses, who could play the role better? Clark Gable was ideal as Rhett Butler and by today's standards, maybe a bit over the top in some scenes, but still excellent. Melanie, a very difficult part was played to perfection by Olivia de Havilland, while Hattie McDaniel's Mammy was brilliant. You can go through the whole cast and rate them so high. The story was very well done, and the settings of the old South were brilliantly captured. See it for what it was, in its day, and glory in the result.",10,4,6,17 September 2004
No Country for Old Men," Violent, Gripping and a bit too long.
","I found 'NoCountry for Old Men' could have been possibly the best film of 2007 had it been some 15 minutes shorter as there were several scenes that dragged, and were very remotely connected to the plot. The photography was brilliant as the setting presented great opportunities to the Cinematographers, the lack of background music helped the suspense, and the acting of all the leads, in particular Josh Brolin, was exceptional. Sure, it is a very violent movie with more blood spilled in two hours than ever seen before (including Al Pacino's 'Scarface'!), but it was gripping throughout, with the ending very surprising. The Woody Harrelson part was a bit superfluous, but Tommy Lee Jones who makes a somewnat belated appearance was in excellent form. If there is a sequel, then Hannibal Lecter will only be a memory.",8,1,4,7 January 2008
Bridesmaids," Gross and Unfunny!
","I had to brace myself to sit through this Film, as I had read some reviews that actually had praised it, and it was a very long two hours to endure what has to be described as one of the most sleazy movies I have yet seen. The attempts at humor mostly concerned pooping/farting/belching and vomiting, so if that is anyone's idea of a comedy then this is for you! The Wedding shop bathroom scene was the most distasteful of a bad lot, while the Airplane sequence was so unbelievable and overlong, and the other so-called 'highlight' was the 'hens' do' that was so badly staged and overacted that the most predictable ending could not come quick enough! I was so sad to see such a great actress as Jill Clayburgh having to lower her standards to take a role in this disaster.",1,25,52,18 April 2013
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Unusual, but not nearly as funny as it tried to be!
","I really looked forward to seeing this Movie as it has had numerous good reviews, and nominations for Awards. It did prove a disappointment to me, in that the 'humorous' bits mainly turned out to be unfunny, and the slapstick situations had me looking for Inspector Clouseau to appear. The photography was excellent, and a joy to look at. Unfortunately, the most enjoyment I had was looking for the stars as they appeared in cameo parts, such as Edward Norton, F. Murray Abraham and Jude Law, etc. All in all , I fail to see how it was nominated in the Best Picture Category for the Oscars, when there were a number (despite the volume of films that were nominated) that were overlooked.",5,4,7,8 March 2015
Seabiscuit," More than a horse Race
","The story of that wonderful Horse, Seabiscuit is a lot more interesting than one would imagine. There is so much to this film that is uplifting to the spirits and is a step back in time , where the 'little' people can be winners too. The mood of the Great Depression is extremely well captured, as is the excitement of a horse that took the imagination of the American people, at a time of great hardship, and gave them plenty to cheer about. A well produced Movie with some really stirring background music - extremely well-acted with Toby Maguire and Jeff Bridges in great form, and William A. Macy in a cameo performance. It was highly nominated in the Oscars of that year - a well deserved honor.",8,0,0,8 August 2005
Django Unchained," Typical Tarantino
","Reviewing this Movie is a conundrum for me, as I found the violence which runs continually through the film quite overpowering, yet I knew full well that any Quentin Tarantino production would be just that. The cast was excellent, with Leonardo DeCaprio in a very unusual role for him,and believe me I have no criticism in that area. My problem is that the story is so far-fetched, it could have been shortened by some 30 minutes or so, and not suffered. The production was brilliantly mounted and the color quite spectacular, and I know critics world-wide have hailed it as great. I must say that it is a film that will shock and appall many film-goers, but a greater majority will love it.",4,1,6,9 April 2013
Million Dollar Baby," The Characters are Great!
","Do not let anyone tell you that this is not a film about boxing as some critics have said - it is, or at least 85% of it is. But, whether you are boxing fan or not (and I am definitely not!) this is a great film, that is brilliantly acted and directed with the three main characters being stand-outs. Firstly, Clint Eastwood's acting and direction are peerless, while Morgan Freeman brilliantly plays his part in an understated way, but what a performance by Hilary Swank - the Academy had to give her the Oscar. The mood of the boxing game was well-caught, but without giving anything away the last half-hour of this movie is fantastic, and will remain in the memory of all who see 'Million Dollar Baby'. Clearly Eastwood is the premier Director in Hollywood with his great 'Mystic River' and now this.",9,1,3,16 March 2005
Blood Diamond," Human Greed at any cost
","I just have to start by saying this is one of the best films of the last 12 months - violent? Yes! Historically correct -probably! Exciting -Yes! Well-acted - Very much so! Good photography - Yes! The list of positives could go on, as there is so much to this movie, and when one now understands the problems and the travails that Sierra Leone endured in the 1990's, the rest of the world should hang its heads in shame. Leonardo de Caprio reaches his peak thus far, and continues to impress more in each movie I've seen him in - his role is very much an umsympathetic one yet he is able to win you over - Jennifer Connelly is very competent in a smaller role, while the supporting cast are superb, with accolades going to the character of Solomon - a tour-de-force achievement. This film will appal, shock and most of all move you in seeing close up man's inhumanity to man because of greed.",Null,1,2,31 January 2007
Inside Man," Well done, Spike Lee
","I have not always been a great fan of Spike Lee, but with The Inside Man, he has really delivered a very good and authentic film capturing the sound and feel of New York City. The plot is a little confusing at times, and complete concentration is a must, or one can very easily miss a key item. Thanks to Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster and Cheistopher Plummer (in particular), you are treated to great acting and suspense in a story that develops into some really good character revelations...but, in a film such as this, the real test is of the Director to deliver, and Mr. Lee has come through with flying colors. It moves at an excellent pace so that the excitement and mystery never wanes. Well worth the entrance money!",7,2,4,31 December 2007
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Two Stars wasting their talents
","Let me start by saying I think Angelina Jolie is absolutely beautiful, and Brad Pitt has really come of age in his more recent movies, BUT this rubbish has not helped either of them improve their CV's. The plot is a very poor jumbled confused one, and while I know much of it is tongue-in-cheek, it just did not work for me in any way. The gadgetry early was a bit of fun, but there were so many 'goofs'in continuity and factual areas, I found it an utter waste of time and one certainly not worthy of the two stars, and Vince Vaughan was also wasted in his role. The one thing that stood out, however, was the clear physical attraction between Angie and Brad and was almost certainly the catalyst for everything that has occurred in their private lives.",3,0,2,11 December 2006
There Will Be Blood," Daniel Day-Lewis is world's best actor
","If I was rating 'There will be Blood' on acting alone, then a 10 would still not do the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis justice - I cannot recall ever seeing a better performance, and if ever an Academy Award was merited, it is his - the other worthy nominees were very unlucky to come against him. The supporting cast was brilliant particularly the actors who played Eli/Paul and the small son. As to the movie, it was brilliantly made, starkly realistic in every way (although I did have a problem with some of the musical background), and photographed superbly BUT the story was a bit too over the top in several places and I felt left a bit to be desired. It will not appeal to everyone - at the screening I attended a number of people left halfway through. I could never do that when Day-Lewis is on the screen - he truly is a majestic performer.",8,1,4,2 March 2008
The Last King of Scotland," Great Acting, but too much Fiction
","Forest Whitaker's performance as Idi Amin in 'The Last King of Scotland' clearly has Oscar written all over it - it was a magnificent portrayal of a vile dictator who destroyed his country. Unfortunately, for me at least, the fiction around the character of the Doctor played by McAvoy took up far too much of the story - I had hoped more time would have been spent on th factual base of Amin's rise to power, rather than depicting imagined goings-on of his personal physician. However, despite the foregoing, it is a powerful film showing the horrors that occurred under the tyrant's rule and how the economy of Uganda was ruined by him and his 'party'. I guess there have been similar instances of African countries striving for their independence from European countries, and the horrors they have endured, and continue to endure.",7,1,2,14 February 2007
The Sixth Sense," Spellbinding from Go to Whoa!
","This was the surprise packet movie of the Year - and I do not mean just the ending.  It held your interest from the very start, and the ending was incredible and completely a huge surprise.   Joel Haley Osment as the boy 'who can see dead people' showed a talent well beyond his years, while Bruce Willis (who has never beeen one of my favourites) did a great job.  Even after seeing the movie, I tried very hard to remember if there had been any mistakes or clues that gave an insight into the memorable denouement, but the continuity and attention to detail was 1st class .  All the supporting cast were excellent, and I would have to rate this film as one of the best of the year -  BUT, if you have not seen it, DO NOT let anyone tell you the ending.",9,1,1,5 July 2004
Gangs of New York," Brutal, Bloody and Brilliant
","From the very opening, you know how violent 'Gangs of New York' is going to be.  The brief appearance of Liam Neeson as Priest is absolutely brilliant and the tone of the movie is set then.  Everyone knows just what a great actor Daniel Day Lewis is, and he does not let himself down in this one - as the Butcher he is Evil personified, and the surprise to me was the maturity of Leonardo de Caprio as Amsterdam, in such an unusual role for him - he was brilliant and proved he is not the light weight actor that I had previously rated him.  Cameron Diaz was fine, as was the supporting cast.  It is definitely not a movie for everyone as the brutality dominates nearly every scene, but if this bears any resemblance to New York in the 1840's and earlier, then we should all have learned about it.",9,1,2,25 July 2004
