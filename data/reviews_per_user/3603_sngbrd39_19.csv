Vertigo," Obsession and the unexpected
","A couple weeks ago, I wrote a comment about another Hitchcock classic, Rear Window. Tonight, I had the chance to see Vertigo for the first time. While I must admit that I didn't like it quite as much as the former film, Vertigo is still a masterfully crafted work of suspense by the man who did it best.John 'Scottie' Ferguson has just retired from the police force, but he has been persuaded to take on a case privately. A college friend is concerned about his wife who has been acting more and more strangely, and Scottie must follow her to discover where she goes in her frequent flights. What follows is a tale of obsession and the unexpected.The one thing that I liked more about Rear Window than about Vertigo is that we got to know the characters better. In Vertigo, most of the characters are either undergoing insanity or pulling off a deception, meaning that we don't really have insight into who these people are. This does not detract from the intrigue or excitement, but it's just something I personally didn't like as much here.On the upside, though, I do believe that Hitchcock created another great work of suspense here. To me, the film was most enhanced by the wonderful cinematography of Robert Burks and the as-always-expressive score of Bernard Hermann. Everything that is seen and heard in the film enhances the story Hitchcock is presenting to us, and it's really a treat for eyes and ears both.Vertigo is a film full of suspense that will keep you guessing throughout. It provides more evidence of the genius of its director.",9,2,4,21 June 2010
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Still holds up to this day
","I don't cry at movies. ET made me cry. Yes, there are parts that are incredibly cheesy. Yes, this movie did spawn Pod People and Mac and Me, two prime examples of cinematic train-wrecks. Yes, I am fully aware that Steven Spielberg is playing with my emotions.But if anyone is going to toy with my feelings, he's probably about the best one to do it.In so many respects, this 26-year-old film holds up incredibly well. Doubtless, if it were to be released today, the character of E.T. would have been computer animated; indeed, much of the film would have been made using that medium. I'm not sure, though, even with today's advanced technology, that any computer image would have been able to emote so convincingly as the puppet used here. The actors, the puppeteers, the director - everyone worked together to such great effect to make the audience believe in that character. And despite the obvious emotional ploys on the way to the film's conclusion (the near-death, tearful goodbyes, etc.), it just feels natural to want to see E.T. happily home with his family again.Between Spielberg's mastery of the language of film and John Williams' rousing, yet sumptuous score (the man might be one of the greatest composers of our time!), this film is masterfully made and a wonder to watch. Although it seems a cliché by now, don't be afraid to let this film move you!",9,3,5,16 May 2008
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Wow all around...
","A film noir involving corporate intrigue and wacky animation? Who wants to see that movie?? Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the story of Eddie Valiant, a detective who was once famous for tackling 'toon cases along with Teddy, his brother and partner. However, he slips into a life of alcoholism and odd PI jobs after Teddy dies at the hands of a 'toon. But everything changes for Eddie when he is hired by R.K. Maroon, a cartoon studio executive, to investigate some funny business (no pun intended) involving 'toon star Roger Rabbit and his wife Jessica.This film is a marvel, both artistically and technologically. Its special effects still hold up today, 20 years after the film's initial release. If this were all Who Framed Roger Rabbit had going for it, that would be pretty amazing. However, the film also has spot-on performances and a great story and script. A film with such artistic *and* technical merits is really something special.For me, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is also amazing because of how differently I have been able to see it over the years. When my 5-year-old self first saw it on its initial home video release, I loved the colorful world of Toontown, Roger's antics, and seeing my favorite cartoon stars side-by-side in the same movie. (Donald and Daffy in the same scene? That was heaven!) I did, however, run and hide from certain scenes later in the movie that I do not want to spoil for those lucky souls who still have yet to see this. As an adult now, I still love the movie as entertainment, but I can also appreciate all the work that went into its creation. It only takes a viewing of the DVD's special features to see that making this film was a painstaking process. Not to mention, in this age of computer animation, realizing that all the animation in this film was done by hand! Wow! Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a technological marvel, an artistic triumph, and an extremely entertaining film. Highly recommended, especially for animation lovers.",9,0,0,12 October 2008
Beauty and the Beast," Best Disney movie
","Call me a Disney shill, but I have never been able to resist watching a Disney movie, no matter how intrusive the songs, how inappropriate the comic relief, how formulaic the plot. This, however, has got to be my favorite of all of them. Every time I see it, it still creates some sort of magic with me. The story is a good retelling of the original fairy tale, which would have made for a very boring movie. The voices are perfect for their characters, and there is no overtly brash comic relief. The music flows nicely with the story, and I can (and will) still sing many of the songs on demand (or not). If you are one of the very, very few who have not yet seen it, I am telling you to go out and see it as soon as you can.",Null,1,2,21 April 2000
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," At Wit's End
","The first Pirates of the Caribbean film, The Curse of the Black Pearl, was a great bit of fun. It was a pirate film, pretty rare at that time, and it had a bit of everything enjoyable in it: romance, humor, great characters (except, oddly enough, for the two romantic leads), and a few chills. It was a fun watch, and deservedly a huge hit.The second film, Dead Man's Chest, was still pretty cool. The Davy Jones subplot brought a lot more story to the film, which weighed it down a bit, but overall it was still a fun watch. The humor was certainly still there, and Johnny Depp continued to shine as Jack Sparrow. Plus, there were some very memorable scenes and visuals, like the fishy crew of the Flying Dutchman.This review, though, is about the third film, At World's End. The third film in a trilogy has the major task of bringing closure to the story lines that have been introduced throughout the series while still leaving open the possibility for another film in case the filmmakers decide to go for a quadrilogy. Sadly, it is my belief that At World's End did not do this in a satisfactory way.It may have been due to the fact that I hadn't seen Dead Man's Chest in a couple years and kind of lost the story. It may have been because I was watching it on TV, where it was frequently interrupted by commercials and possibly edited down for time. However, to me, it seemed that At World's End was kind of a messy film. By this point, there was soooo much story that the whole endeavor seemed to have been weighed down with the effort of dealing with so many plot lines. To me, it seemed that this was a failed attempt to bring an epic scope to the Pirates of the Caribbean series. Instead of feeling grand, it just got really muddled.This is mostly due to the many dealings with the politics of the pirate world. Trades and alliances and power struggles...this was touched on in the first film, but it never got in the way of the main story. Here, it felt like these elements of the story took up too much time, and they definitely dragged the film down.Even with those elements aside, we still had so much to juggle: Davy Jones/the Flying Dutchman; Bootstrap Bill and Will; Elizabeth's ascension through the ranks of piracy; Calypso's release; the various anti-pirate Englishmen whose names I now fail to remember...I'm all for complex, rich films, but by the end of this one, my brain hurt pretty badly. These elements were all thrown at us hard and fast, which made the film pretty messy in the end.On the positive side, the special effects were still wonderful. Also, there were some pretty cool fight scenes, which helped to keep the film from completely becoming bogged down in itself. By the same token, the wedding of Will and Elizabeth was pretty cool, though, according to the final scene, it appears that their married life won't quite be what they were expecting...On the whole, though, this convoluted film was the weakest of the entire Pirates series. And, help us all, they're making a fourth one...I think I'm all pirated out now.",5,0,0,28 December 2009
Lost in Translation," A beauteous film
","There is a beauty that is pervasive throughout the film Lost in Translation. I see it in the gorgeous photography that shows us the city of Tokyo in all its glory. I hear it in the expressive soundtrack that enhances the emotions experienced throughout. Most of all, though, I feel it in the connection between Bob and Charlotte, two lonely Americans drifting through a brief stay in Japan's capital.Bob is an actor doing promotional work for Santorey Whiskey. Charlotte is accompanying her photographer husband on a job that brings him across the Pacific Ocean. Both characters are married, but experiencing bumps in their marriages and doubts about their spouses. And both are feeling isolated in a city of millions. A series of chance meetings in their hotel draws them together. They are soon experiencing the city together, enjoying each other's company.One of the concerns I had going into this movie was the potential for, for lack of a better word, 'squick' between Bill Murray's and Scarlett Johanssen's characters. Murray is old enough to be Johanssen's father, and I was afraid that the movie was going to take us to very uncomfortable places with that age difference. Thankfully, no such 'squick' occurred. There is certainly an intimacy between them in the way that they share their feelings and concerns, but nothing that feels inappropriate.Overall, Lost in Translation is quite a lovely film. It may take a viewing or two to truly understand or appreciate it; it took me five years before I really got it. But once you get it, it's certainly worth the watch.",8,0,2,5 April 2010
Corpse Bride," Tell me more, Tim!
","First, let me get the negative portion of this review out of the way: I did feel a little let down by this movie. At a very brisk 76 minutes, it seems as if there should have been more story to tell, more details to give...and maybe one or two more Danny Elfman songs (even though he wasn't really at his best in this movie). A few more moments between Victor and Victoria would have been especially wonderful; their characters shared such a special chemistry with each other. The story was so straightforward, and it definitely could have benefited from slowing down the pace a bit more. (But then again, had the movie been any longer, the poor animators would have spent several weeks more finishing it up!!) Otherwise, Corpse Bride was a wonderful movie. I am absolutely a sucker for the Tim Burton 'look', which was here in spades. The slightly macabre, utterly haunting world of the dead, which was placed in direct contrast with the antiseptic, colorless world of Victorian England, conjured up some memories of Nightmare Before Christmas without being a complete retread. Also, the acting in this movie (both by the puppets and the voice actors) was wonderful. Although the characters were pretty much par for the course in this kind of movie, they were acted so wonderfully that we in the audience still cared for them and hoped for Victor, Victoria, and Corpse Bride to all have a happy ending, as they did. And although we knew from the first that Lord Barkin is a rotten apple, we want to know how he's going to get what's coming to him in the end.Though slightly disappointing in the story department, Corpse Bride is still a wonderful film that will tickle your quirky-bone as only Tim Burton can. I definitely recommend this film.",7,2,3,1 October 2005
"Monsters, Inc."," What is this strange feeling?
","I don't believe I've ever had this feeling walking out of a Disney/Pixar film. Oh, sure, it happens during Disney films, but never when Pixar is involved. I can't quite pinpoint what it is. I guess it could be best described as...disappointment.Well, it was unfortunately bound to happen someday. The good folks at Pixar have given us a sub-par (by their very, very high standards) film. Oh, sure, the cast was top-notch, especially Billy Crystal and John Goodman as our protagonists Mike and Sully. The story was awfully creative. Seeing those monsters in our closet as real, working people was a great idea. What went wrong? It felt like the movie was lacking something, that the old charm from the 'Toy Story' movies was gone. Many of the jokes, especially in the first part of the film, fell flat. It felt as if they weren't even trying, or else that they were trying too hard. Much of the first half of the film was spent looking at the screen in bewildered silence. However, there were also some pleasant surprises to be found. Ever since I saw young Boo in the advertisements for this film, I was sure she was going to be one of those characters who was so cute that she made you want to gag. As it turned out, despite one or two sickening moments, she wasn't too bad. The scenes between her and Sully were filled with very well-played emotion, making the audience feel warm and fuzzy instead of nauseous. Also, normally the endings to these movies are pretty weak. Although it was weaker than that of, say, 'Toy Story 2', it was much better than what I expected, filled with both funny and touching moments. So, if you decide to see 'Monsters, Inc.' be forewarned of this: You too may have a slightly hollow feeling inside upon walking out of this film, and you too may ask yourself, 'What's wrong with this picture?'",Null,0,1,24 November 2001
The Princess Bride," 'Is this a kissing book?'
","(Re: the spoiler warning. I put it there just to be safe, because I do discuss one or two plot details. But if you really haven't seen this movie yet, go out and do it. Right now.) Tonight, I had the pleasure of revisiting the movie that has been my favorite since I was a young middle schooler. Each time I watch The Princess Bride, I appreciate it more and more. When I was younger, I was always captured by the beautiful love story between Buttercup and Westley, and I thrilled at his daring escapades to fight through anything, even death (mostly death, at least), to get his true love back from the nasty Prince Humperdinck. Now, dozens of viewings and several readings of the book later, I can appreciate it for its witty asides, the way it gently pokes fun at some conventions of the fantasy genre without being mean-spirited or cynical. I marvel at what might be the best cameo role ever, the Impressive Clergyman. But most of all, I wonder how I can still be drawn into a love story that has its feet so firmly planted in the realm of fantasy; how can it become so real to me every time I watch this film? Because it is so wonderfully acted, written, and directed, and this combination of factors creates a magic that can still make an old girl like me swoon. Of course, the movie has its share of flaws (weird '80s synthesizers in the soundtrack? obvious shots of body doubles doing gymnastics in the Man-in-Black/Inigo fencing scene??), but...well, I really don't care. The good parts of the movie are enough to overcome any complaint I may have.As a parting shot, if you love this movie, you really ought to read the book by William Goldman...erm, S. Morgenstern. It's even better!! (Yes, young Fred Savage, it is a kissing book; but most of us wouldn't have it any other way.)",10,0,1,2 January 2006
Toy Story," The one that started it all
","Toy Story will forever be remembered as the first feature film to be fully animated by computer. Since its debut in 1995, dozens more have joined it, including a sequel (soon to be two sequels as of this writing), as well as several other excellent films from its animation company, Pixar. However, for its unique accomplishment, Toy Story stands alone. It doesn't hurt that even beyond the technical achievement, the film is charming, well-written, and touching.The toys in question belong to Andy, who has a huge variety of them scattered around his room. The unofficial head toy is Woody, a cowboy toy who has 'been Andy's favorite since kindergarten'. Woody loves being the favored toy, but the order is shaken up when Andy receives a surprise present on his birthday: a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who causes Woody to become jealous when he begins to take over the #1 toy position in Andy's playtime.There's a lot of good stuff in this film: The animation, which mostly still works 15 years later; the voice acting, which is carried out excellently; the story, which keeps viewers engaged throughout. What gets me most about Toy Story is the way that both Woody and Buzz must grow throughout the movie. Woody has to let go of his jealousy and accept that things change when someone new enters the mix. Buzz has to learn (the hard way) that he really is a toy, but that he has a very important role as such. This is better character development than we see in some 'more mature' films. It was here that Pixar began a long line of memorable, excellently crafted characters.Pixar has released ten feature films in the past fifteen years. Toy Story 3 this summer will make eleven. They've maintained a very high standard of quality during that time. It definitely helps that, with Toy Story, they were off to an excellent start.",9,1,1,5 June 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," A good story that packs an emotional punch
","In the beginning, Dreamworks Animation had excellent 2-D films such as The Prince of Egypt and Road to El Dorado. I thoroughly enjoyed these films, and they were just as good as what Disney was putting out at the time. These films, while they had good comedic scenes, seemed to have a more serious overall tone to them, and they packed a good emotional punch. Then came 2001, with the release of Shrek. Everything changed for Dreamworks at this point: mostly CG animation, broader comedy, a greater focus on celebrity voices and topical humor. Shrek itself, and its first sequel, were very funny and enjoyable uses of this formula. However, Dreamworks soon pigeonholed itself into that sort of movie, becoming known as second-rate to Pixar in the process.Then came How to Train Your Dragon. This movie is about Hiccup, the son of a Viking leader whose village slays the dragons that steal their food. Hiccup longs to be seen as a man, but he has not shown the skills or strength that a dragon-slayer normally would. One day, he does manage to catch a dragon, whom he eventually names Toothless. Toothless proceeds to change his life, and the life of Hiccup's village, in the process.How to Train Your Dragon felt like a return to the Dreamworks movies from the '90s/early '00s. There were certainly comedic scenes, but the story was focused on the relationships between the characters in a very meaningful way. Through the course of the movie, we see how Hiccup's relationships with Toothless, with his father, and with the other youths in his village grow and develop. Seeing how these characters relate to each other gives this film a certain power that has been missing from many of the more recent Dreamworks films, and it was so much the better for that.In addition to the story, the visuals in this film were remarkable. A good deal of attention was paid to the details in each character, especially in the different types of dragons that were created for the film. And the scenes in which the characters flew were absolutely breathtaking. It helps that I saw this film on a big screen outdoors; the visual and aural spectacle is certainly compounded in that format.If you, too, have felt burned by Dreamworks Animation in recent years, don't hesitate to come see How to Train Your Dragon. It is absolutely a pleasant surprise.",Null,0,0,24 July 2011
The Lion King," It's all there
","To begin with a little side note, it didn't dawn on me until recently that Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane both did voices in this film. Perhaps it was a foreshadowing of their later success on Broadway in 'The Producers'. But that's off the topic. Even though 'Producers' is a great musical, I'm here to talk about 'The Lion King', a great animated musical. To get this video was my most fervent wish for my birthday on the year it came on video. I had missed it in the theater, and I absolutely had to have the video as a result. I wasn't disappointed! Although it's not as great as, say, 'Beauty and the Beast' or 'Aladdin', it's still a movie that I enjoy watching now as much as I enjoyed watching it then. Timon and Pumbaa have to be my favorite characters; it's kind of sad now thinking that they were the last 'comic' sidekicks in a Disney movie who were truly funny. It was probably due to the fact that Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella just made such a good team. Scar and Mufasa made the perfect 'Claudius and Old Hamlet'. Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones did a wonderful job with these two. As always, Disney's high artistic standards were upheld, giving the African jungle all its different facets, from majestic Pride Rock to the eerie Elephant Graveyard. And with Elton John composing the music, how could they go wrong? (As long as he wasn't rehashing any of his old songs...) Overall, 'The Lion King' is a great Disney film, wonderful to watch when one is losing faith in the Disney of today as a reminder that yes, they are capable of good moviemaking.",Null,0,0,22 December 2001
The Emperor's New Groove," A new direction for Disney
","Lately, Disney movies have been on a downward path. Personally, I've found the vast majority enjoyable (with the glaring exception of 'Pocahontas'), but there is still a marked decrease in quality between, say, 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Tarzan'. You could see the movies falling into the same old rut over and over and over again. However, 'Emperor's New Groove' changed all that. Instead of a contrived love story, there's a buddy comedy featuring the hilarious duo of David Spade and John Goodman. Instead of sappy morals (particularly the sappy morals of being yourself and of finding inner beauty), we get hilarious one-liners and laugh-out-loud situations. And instead of the cute comic sidekick, we get doe-eyed characters (particularly the children and the squirrel) with a significant bite. Needless to say, this one had me in stitches. One part of 'Emperor' as well as the new Disney trend in general that somewhat saddens me, though, is the move away from the musical format. I know I'm somewhat part of a minority, but I've always loved the songs from Disney movies, even if they do seem intrusive. (Actually, I never thought of them as intrusive, really, but I know many people think that.) Disney hasn't put out an honest to goodness musical in quite a while. Although I do agree that not all Disney movies should be musicals, I also hope that they decide not to abandon the format entirely. Disney movies have recently been pretty much the only place for musicals on the big screen, so I would hope that they would continue to give us the great musical moments we've come to expect. But enough of my editorial. 'Emperor's New Groove' is one of my favorite Disney movies ever and has surpassed 'Aladdin' as the funniest Disney movie in my mind. So sit back, relax, and forget anything else Disney's ever done. This, I hope, is a sample of the future.",8,1,2,22 June 2001
Rear Window," Quintessential Hitchcock
","Alfred Hitchcock is known as the 'Master of Suspense'. By now, this seems a cinematic cliché, but it is so very true. The man knew how to direct films that keep you riveted to your seat, wondering what will happen next to the characters he has presented to you. Rear Window is a prime example of this.Rear Window is the story of L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart), a photographer who broke his leg while on assignment. While confined to his apartment in a wheelchair, he has three main links to the outside world: his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter); his girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly); and his large rear window, which provides him a view of many goings-on in the surrounding apartment buildings. Jefferies comes to know a lot about the daily routines of these neighbors, and he becomes suspicious when one man begins to act in ways out of the ordinary.In this film, the suspense is layered thickly. There were parts during which I sat with my mouth agape, wondering what would happen next to the characters investigating this potential crime. However, Hitchcock makes this more than simply a suspense film. There is *a lot* of character study here; we learn volumes about both the main characters and the neighbors that they view from the window. There is speculation on the nature and ethics of voyeurism, whether Jefferies, Lisa, and Stella really should be doing what they are doing. There is also a message about what a neighbor truly is, and how that sort of relationship has grown weaker in our modern world. (How much more so now, over 55 years after this movie's release?) Rear Window is quintessential Hitchcock. Admittedly, I have not yet seen many of his films. (Other than this, I have only seen Rebecca and Psycho.) I think it's safe to say, however, that this film provides the same combination of elements that make his other films great: gripping suspense, characters we can really get to know, and thoughtful exploration of the things we humans do.",10,0,1,29 May 2010
The Replacements," A pleasant surprise!!
","OK, normally I'm the person who complains about too many cliches or lack of originality in movies, but I really enjoyed this one. Maybe it was because absolutely everyone else in the theater was laughing. Maybe it was because my friend was almost in tears laughing. Whatever it was, I was almost rolling on the floor during some scenes. Keanu Reeves' performance wasn't groundbreaking or anything; in fact, it was kind of dull. Gene Hackman was the typical 'I love you guys but I'm ready to kick your butts if I need to' coach. All the supporting people were typical sports movie cliches. But it all just worked!! I especially loved Orlando Jones as the fumbling receiver. I never knew that a movie about football, one of my least favorite sports, could be this good!",Null,1,2,17 September 2000
Aladdin," Disney finds its trendiness
","Don't get me wrong, trendiness and pop culture humor do not a good movie make. In 'Aladdin', though, it just worked. Robin Williams pulled it off really well. I love the movie through and through, but I'll say that he was the best part about it, even though it did take me a while to realize who all the people he was impersonating were. It wasn't only Robin Williams, though, so don't think that's what I'm saying. The music was also really good. I tried to learn all the songs from the soundtrack, but I never quite got them all. I just love the movie as a whole. My fondest memory of it is when two of my friends and I tried once to act the whole movie out, but we never got past the scene where Aladdin sings 'One Jump Ahead'. I was the shortest, so I always played Iago and Abu. Not even 'Beauty and the Beast', my favorite Disney movie, has such nostalgic value to me. It's only too bad that neither of the sequels was worthy to carry the Aladdin name.",Null,1,1,24 August 2000
Pocahontas," Nope, sorry
","I first watched this movie with some friends of mine at a party. We were planning to really watch it at first. Instead, we ended up riffing on it 'Mystery Science Theater' style. We just couldn't get past how boring and uninteresting it was. After a while, we just stopped paying attention. It's not only that it butchers history something fierce. Several movies have done that. This one just couldn't get away with it. You see everything that's going to happen in the movie from a million miles away, which really just drains the fun out of it. Except for the song 'Colors of the Wind', the soundtrack wasn't that great, either. And Grandmother Willow? She just seemed to be thrown in to be the person (I'm sorry, tree) who tells the heroine to 'follow your heart'. That's basically all she did! What was the point of having her there? Anyway, 'Pocahontas' just didn't do it for me. Go see 'Hunchback of Notre Dame' instead.",Null,0,2,28 August 2000
The Wedding Singer," More, please
","This is the best Adam Sandler movie I've seen, with the possible exception of 'The Waterboy.' He actually shows that he can do something that doesn't involve a warmed over 'Saturday Night Live' character of his. I hope, even though I know this is a totally outlandish belief, that we can see something else this great from him, but after seeing 'Big Daddy' I'm not so sure that's going to happen soon.",Null,0,1,21 April 2000
The Wizard of Oz," What can I say?
","Everything I like about this movie has already been mentioned by everyone else, so please don't get mad at me if I repeat something. This is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. I didn't see it consciously until I was about nine or ten, but it hooked me right away. I absolutely love watching this movie about the fantastic world of Oz, which was enriched by reading the book afterward. I do understand why the book had to be abridged for the movie as it would have all been too long to put in there, but it would have been nice to see the Quadlings and the Town of China People in it. Well, I also love the music, which I used to have memorized. Judy Garland was an especially good singer and actress, and every time I sing 'Over the Rainbow' to myself or others, I find myself copying her. My personal favorite was, of course, Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion (I can still say the 'Put 'em up, put 'em up' scene by heart). All in all, it is one for the ages.",Null,0,1,21 August 2000
