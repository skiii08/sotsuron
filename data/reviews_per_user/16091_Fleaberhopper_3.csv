Deja Vu," Silly with a capital S
","I guess there will always be a market for movies that have to do with time travel. Unfortunately, when it comes to the gimmick of going back and forth in time, inevitably the writers are confronted with something called 'logic.' That 'logic' is missing in droves in this movie and suspension of disbelief is more than an unusual occurrence.Also, I think it is time that Denzel Washington stops playing cops, whether they belong to the federal branch or not.His acting has become predictable and worse, boring. He is a good actor whose talents are going to waste.Every character in this movie is predictable and never hint to any kind of originality.To make the movie even more unpalatable, Val Kilmer, who is in his own right an extremely talented actor with a powerful range, is totally wasted in this film.He could have e-mailed his lines.Also, I don't know whether he gained weight for the role, but his leading man good looks were left at home and in their place was a pudgy, overweight mug of someone who does not care what he looks like. In Hollywood, that can be dangerous.",3,5,11,23 September 2007
The Secret in Their Eyes," A VERY good film
","This is one of the best movies I've seen in the last 10 years. It is intelligent and crafted to perfection. It also stays two steps in front of the audience trying to guess what is going to happen next.By the looks of it, Argentina is producing movies that are at par with the best of the best.One only has to see Las nueve reinas and El secreto de sus ojos to appreciate first rate cinema.One thing that has surprised me is the lack of reviews from mainstream press in the USA. This movie is better than anything Hollywood has put out in the last 5 years. F",10,20,28,13 February 2010
Bridget Jones's Diary," Poor Jane Austen
","With more than a few moments plagiarized from 'Pride & Prejudice' this movie, in the end, is a dud. Helen Fielding, who wrote the '...Jones Diary' novel and the screenplay should, in the future, try to be more original, and not depend on dead authors for ideas.Also, no matter what Hugh Grant says during TV interviews, Ms Zellweger English accent just does not cut it.
