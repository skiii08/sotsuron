Deja Vu," An interesting movie
","I found Denzel Washington to be excellent, as usual, in this movie. Val Kilmer was good in the role he played. Give the guy a break, we all get older. Some of the better actors in the business today are all 'old farts'. Jim Caviezel fans will enjoy his dark role in this movie.I don't want to give the movie away, but the time travel plot works for this script. As one reviewer noted, time travel, as a movie plot has its problems. The complications of that travel are well written and well worth seeing. This is really a movie that you need to watch 100%, if you are distracted with other things during the viewing process, you will be disappointed.If you like Denzel Washington and if you like Val Kilmer, you will enjoy this movie. Time travel fans will love the plot and all the turns it takes. Remember 'Back to the Future'?",8,1,2,16 September 2014
