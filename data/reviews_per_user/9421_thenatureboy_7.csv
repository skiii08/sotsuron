Catch Me If You Can," A good movie... despite the advertising
","When I saw the advertising for this title, I thought I was in for a joyous romp as Tom Hanks chased Leo all over the board.  Instead, this was a fairly serious movie.  It was way more dramatic than advertised, but still a nice movie.  Not a laugh-fess by any stretch, but a pretty nice movie.P.S. - Walken rules... yet again.",7,0,2,18 May 2003
Spider-Man 2," A very good movie, well worth the price of admission
","If you simply judge this movie as an adaption of a comic book, then it succeeds well beyond most competition (X2 being the closest).  However, to simply call this movie a 'comic book movie' is a short shrift to an excellent piece work.  Here a short list of why this movie was a 9 (I would have called it 8.5 - but since I couldn't I rounded up).The Acting:  Molina and Maguire are both good actors and go a good job with campin' it up (ala Adam West from 'Batman').  Also, Rami has done a good job casting a group of actors that really seem to fit their roles (J.K. Simmons as Jameson; Harris as Aunt May; and Dylan Baker as the Lizard - ere um' Dr. Conners).  The weakest link would be James Franco as Harry Osborn - who still did a pretty good job.The Pacing:  This movie clips along.  It rarely has a dull moment but isn't filled with wall to wall action like a John Woo Special.  2 hours just flew by, which is nice.  Although I'm not a filmmaker, I imagine that the Director, the Editor, and the Screenwriter would take credit for this.The Special Effects:  Unlike the Hulk or Van Helsing, this movie integrates special effects into a scene, rather than standing out like a bad cardboard cutout.  Although I personally think the best special effects in any movie are the size tricks that Jackson pulls with the Hobbit-size versus real-size in the Lord the Rings, this movie really uses the special effects to tell a story (i.e. Spiderman's incredible abilities - and lack thereof at some points).All in all, a very good movie worth the $7.50!",9,0,0,5 July 2004
Troy," A Great Greek Tragedy
","If a Tragedy is making the wrong choice at the wrong time, then the characters in this fine movie have lived (and died) through one.  For example:1) Taking Helen to Troy 2) Defending Paris 3) Attacking the Greeks at Night 4) Taking the Horse into the CityOf course, all of these decisions were made by Trojans, which makes you wonder if they didn't bring it all on themselves in this movie... but I digress.Although Brad Pitt's acting was a little cardboard, his character is basically a characterization.  Hector, being much more human and fallible, came across more as a person - which didn't help him much in his fight with Achilles.The battle scenes were tremendous.  The line between C.G.I. and live action is more blurred every day.  I couldn't point out any obviously bad graphics (unlike the 'burly brawl' in Matrix Reloaded).  I would have liked more of Sean Bean - but Ulysses was always a very interesting character anyway.P.S. to Wolfgang - could somebody remind Orlando Bloom that we are in the Hellenistic Age - not Middle Earth - when using the Bow he morphed into Legolas..... All I needed was an Cave Troll to come up and smite the Greeks.Final Tally - 8 out 10 - with a probable 9 or 9.5 for the inevitable DVD with added scenes.",8,1,2,15 May 2004
Ocean's Twelve," Horrible, a complete waste of a rental... I should have gone with Leonard Part 6
","I have reviewed a few films and voted on many more! This is the lowest ranking I have ever given. Why? Because this movie failed on every possible level. I would have given it a 1 if not for Vincant Cassel - who actually did more than phone in a performance. Where to start..The plot... What plot? It looks like the same crew that brought you the Cannonball Run has decided to do a picture with 'A' list actors. I challenge anyone to find anything remotely plausible about this plot! By the time you see the Oceans 11 crew steal the egg from the courier, you have to wonder what in the heck you were thinking renting this bomb or buying a ticket.The Direction... I can't believe I'm saying this, but Soderbergh couldn't hold the camera still. I thought I was watching my Aunt Petunia's 75 birthday party. I don't get me started about the editing..The Acting.. Now I remember why George Clooney was known as Dr. Doug before he was an 'A' list actor. If he can't manage a better performance than this, he should stick to tongue wrestling with Bill O'Reilly. Really, after Solaris, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and this stinker, I'm ready to crown Noah Wiley as the only star from ER to make it after ER... and thats based on his Librarian movie on TNT. I never thought the Peacemaker would be Dr. Doug's seminal work!People, I love movies. But I sincerely have to warn anyone who expects anything close to the Vegas-Love Fest - completely enjoyable Oceans 11 to avoid this disaster!",2,1,2,18 April 2005
Van Helsing," If you go in expecting Shakespeare...
","you will leave disappointed, BUT, this is a good, fun movie.The Special Effects are great, as is the action.  The plot is a little thin, but I rank it as good as Frank Langella having a mid-air love scene in his 70's version of the Dracula tale.  How much plot do you REALLY expect in a movie with Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein's Monster?  Please!  And, it was pretty obvious that much like the 'mummy' movies, that this one did not take it self too seriously (which doomed 'the matrix' sequels).  Would everyone have felt better if Dracula and Van Helsing had a round table discussion on the Vatican Holy Knights?The bottom line is that if you want some fun, go see this movie.  If not, save the money and buy a Bob Woodward book.",7,1,2,9 May 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Smooth as Butter
","As a preface, I waited for a second viewing before making a vote or comment. That being said, I gave the movie a perfect 10 and can only make positive comments about the movie.First, it is impossible to say that this movie was either better or worse than LOTR/Fellowship of the Rings, because both movies served different purposes.  The first movie devoted much of it's time setting up the story, establishing characters, and familiarizing the viewer with the world of Middle Earth.  The second movie was able to move the entire story along. The much more 'action' nature of the second movie was probably a result of this.  In addition, the Two Towers book also has much more action than the first.  Therefore, those differences in the movies can be explained.Second, just like everyone else on the planet, I would concur that the special effects were amazing (although most of my amazement was with the Gollum and character - versus the Helm's Deep battle).  The Battle of Pellanor Fields will be incredible!Third, the acting was the part of the movie that really kept me in the story.  Lots of movies have big action and cannot keep your attention. The performances by Viggio Mortenson, Bernard Hill, Brad Dourif, and Elijah Wood were very solid.Anyway, many people much more eloquent than me have waxed on about this movie.  This was a very good time.  If the purpose of the middle act of trilogy is to set up the grand finale, this movie was a complete success. However, it was also an entertaining evening in and of itself.",10,0,0,27 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," WAS WORTH NOT GETTING TO SLEEP TO SEE...
","Most times, events which are hyped up never measure up to the expectations (Star Wars Prequels; Godfather III; any of Costner's movies from the last 10 years), but the Return of the King was certainly worth having to go to work on 3 hours sleep to manage the midnight showing I went to on December 16th, 2003.  Here are a few reasons the movie is a work of art:The Acting: 1) Sean Astin was great.  Having seen all 3 movies, although Aragorn and Frodo are heroic, this story seems to be Sam's story.  I found myself caring more about and for his character than any other.2)  Ian McKellen carried the middle portion of the movie.  More than anything else, McKellen's Gandalf brought energy to the screen.  As fantastical as the concept of a 'Wizard' is, McKellen makes Gandalf a real person doing extraordinary things.3)  Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar for best supporting actor. Period.The Directing: If David Lean is the benchmark for 'old' Hollywood, then Peter Jackson is the new king of the CGI era.  He kept the action moving and (other than an ending which lingered on a little) did not disappoint.The Story: Thank you J.R.R. Tolkien for your imagination and depth.I strongly urge people to see this movie.  I am the proud owner of Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers DVD, extended editions.  I am eagerly awaiting the third extended edition so that I can - in one day's sitting - see what Jackson's full vision is for this material.  In the meantime, please catch this movie on the big screen.",10,0,0,18 December 2003
