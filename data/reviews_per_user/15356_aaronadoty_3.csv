It," Strong in parts, IT struggles to stay fresh and maintain cohesion
","With some great set-piece scares and an ensemble of impressive teen actors, IT works well and hews close to the feel and substance of King's source material, even though its narrative core often feels weak. The movie struggles in places to escape clich√© (heavy reliance on a scary house and scary clown being the main offenders), but manages to find disturbing power in the behaviour of the adult (and near adult) citizens of Derry. Writing in Entertainment Weekly, Chris Nashawaty complains of Pennywise the clown, 'the more we see of him, the less scary he becomes'. This is true, but - whether intentionally or not - this truth reflects a central theme of the movie: it is by banding together and overcoming their fear of IT that the 'Losers' club' ultimately prevails.",7,0,1,25 June 2018
Oblivion," Exquisite production and great performers wasted on feeble script
","This film looks beautiful. The ravaged Earth, full of the detritus of civilisation; the lovingly designed aircraft and drones; and the house that looks like something from the Jetsons brought to architect-inspired life. They are all stunning, and the film lingers over them, rightly proud of their magnificent, on-screen realisation. Cruise, Freeman, Riseborough and Kurylenko all turn in solid performances, but the show is stolen by Leo as Sally ('Are you an effective team?') even though she only appears as a video image, and mostly in grainy black and white. GoT's Costner-Waldau is wasted in a cardboard cut-out role.Ultimately, however, the film disappoints time and again through its shoddy script and tiredly predictable, pasted-on action sequences. The film is at its best when nothing much is happening, little or nothing is being said and you have time to just gaze at the gorgeous eye-candy.As with the original cinema release of 'Bladerunner', the expository voice-over narration at the start is a mistake and serves only as the first example of the many disappointments to come in the ham-fisted storytelling.",5,1,1,10 November 2015
Insidious," After a strong start, 'Insidious' fails to deliver
","'Insidious' has a number of things going for it: a stylish credit sequence, with an old- school giallo feel to it, and enhanced by the creepy still images; a gorgeous house as the setting for the first part of the movie, which builds some great atmosphere; and a spookily discordant stringed-instrument score (though it has a tendency to overwhelm the action on occasion). There is also an excellent jump-scare about halfway through that caused me to call out involuntarily as I sat watching the movie in my empty living room. Unfortunately, the shift in action from the 'haunted' house also sees the movie lose its way. The characters proliferate, but fail to add depth, and as Rose Byrne's 'woman on the verge' storyline fades into the background, so does any sense of compelling narrative. The action takes an unwelcome baroque turn, and the attempts at humor do not add to a series of sequences that commit the grievous sin of failing to be even remotely scary. After a promising start, the disappointing second and third acts feel like they have been pasted in from another movie altogether.",5,0,0,5 August 2015
