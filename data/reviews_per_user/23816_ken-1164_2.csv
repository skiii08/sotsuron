The Avengers," Assembles all the right parts
","A movie some four years in the making, from the post-credit teaser of 2008's excellent Iron Man and 2010 sequel, through last year's equally impressive though very different Thor and Captain America movies. The weight of expectation is often a tough one to bear, with the question being could the bringing together of these stories and characters hope to equal the sum of the parts? As a long time comic book fan I would have to say the answer is a resounding 'yes'. In fairness I did have good reason to hope - Joss Whedon is a long time Marvel comics writer, and his speciality is ensemble characters. As with the highly successful Buffy and Angel franchises he has a talent for gel'ing an aparrently incongruous group - exploring the conflicts between the characters with humour to bring them together. Even the relatively underdeveloped characters - Mark Ruffalo as the new Banner / Hulk, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, and Scarlett Johanssen's Black Widow are fleshed out and given fair screen time, each essential to the plot in their own way. Nick Fury and his team of Shield agents also play their part, while Tom Hiddleston's return as the arrogant demi-god Loki provides ample threat, with the feeling of something darker lurking in the wings - make sure you wait for the inevitable post-credit teaser for a clue as to what. True, the movie does rely heavily on super-powered set pieces, from the clashes of egos (and fists, hammers, shields and repulsors) within the group to the incredible city-wrecking finale, but what else would you expect or hope from in a movie like this? From the action-packed set-pieces and great one-liners through to the human interactions Avengers Assembles all of the parts and proves the whole to be greater than the sum.",10,2,6,1 May 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Awful, nothing unexpected about that after Bored of The Rings
","The Hobbit is the novel that made me fall in love with literature when I was 10 years old. I read it every year for at least 15 years, and a few times since and it never fails to amuse and entertain me. Now, I realise that there are lots of people who loved the Lord Of The Rings movie - most of whom had never read the book - it was a typical Hollywood adaptation, all sound and fury signifying nothing. Peter Jackson upset millions of genuine LOTR fans as well as the Tolkien estate by re-writing the novel to make it nothing more than a dull, over-long, self-indulgent CGI popcorn movie. I had hoped, given that The Hobbit is a much simpler and lighter tale that Jackson might restrain himself and just tell the story, but no, once again he has the arrogance to believe he is a greater creator than Tolkien and rewrites massive segments of the story, adding events and characters that didn't exist in the book, and which don't add any value whatsoever to the story. On the contrary, they make the movie dull, flat, boring, and over-long. There is no question that Peter Jackson is just milking this to rake in as many bucks as he can. It's cynical and calculated and lacking any respect for the source material. The addition of characters and story elements from LOTR who were not mentioned in the book is particularly distasteful. I should have expected nothing more after LOTR, so my bad for stumping up my hard- earned cash to go and see it. I came very close to walking out of the cinema in disgust, and I will certainly not be paying to see the sequels.",1,42,82,17 December 2012
