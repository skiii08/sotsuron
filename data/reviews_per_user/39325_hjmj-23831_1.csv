First Man," I don't understand how one of the most interesting stories in modern history made such a boring movie
","I had to watch this movie over two days because how they wasted the cinematic format in retelling this story. This is especially disappointing when you think about who was behind the camera Damian Chazelle, who just a few years prior made Whiplash; a movie about a jazz drummer which felt more a like war film.
However, I cannot give this film a bad review. The performances were good across the board. The score was acceptable but forgettable (again surprising given Chazelle's previous work). The film did great job at letting be a part of the Armstrong's household. But my biggest fault with this picture is the lack of entertainment value.",5,2,4,22 February 2020
