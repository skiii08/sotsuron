Hereditary," It was scary but that's about it
","Very scary and creepy, it definitively can make you cover your face, but the whole plot and ending were not very good, there was a big plot hole that really made no sense to me (the fire situation), I don't care how mysterious the movie is, you have to explain everything, but overall it was ok.",7,0,1,20 June 2018
Meet Joe Black," Interesting piece of crap
","The only reason I give this movie a 5 is because, I have to admit that throughout most of the movie I found interesting the whole idea of death taking the form of a guy and learning to be human and all that. Everything else was just dumb, unrealistic, Hollywood clich√© kind of stuff. Everyone who liked this movie a 100%, was just fascinated with how pretty and cute the protagonists looked together.Superficial BS.Yes it had a good message about life and how we should not take it from granted, but I don't think we need 3 hours of our time to be reminded of that. The acting was OK, the girl's acting was horrible, Brad Pitt was good, Hopkins was OK, everybody else just seemed desperate to look good in from of the camera.",5,0,0,19 October 2015
