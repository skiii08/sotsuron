Miracle," Lake Placid a place like Bern ?
","Watching the Miracle, it is (for a German viewer at least) not easy to resist a comparison with the just released 'Wunder von Bern' (Miracle of Bern) movie linked to the German Soccer Worldcup Win 1954 against the 4 year long undefeated Hungarians. The parallels are easy to draw : Here are the Americans still depressed from the Vietnam drama and suffering additional hits thru recession and hostage taking at their Iranian Embassy (events which are back grounded in the movie), but who rise against and regain their pride thru some All American boys bringing down the unsurmountable Russians (USSR people to be correct at that time)on the ice in Lake Placid to righten the set-up between the 2 world powers. Here are the German Underdogs just 9 years after World War 2 revitalizing a whole Nation and putting them on track for the 'Wirtschaftswunder' (Economic Miracle) that put Germany into the leading group of industrialized Nations. Here is Herb Brooks, the no-nonsense Coaching Guru, there is Sepp (Josef) Herberger, who made a living from one liners like 'The ball is round' and 'The Game lasts 90 Minutes'. But this is also where the difference is : While the Miracle is carried almost only on the shoulders of Kurt Russell as the charismatic coach molding average College Boys into Winners, the main story of the German movie is the reunification of a Father, who is a late returner (9 years after war ended) from Russian prison camp, with his family (Mother, daughter, grown up boy sympathizing with Eastern Socialism and a younger boy he has never seen before. He lost his place as head of the family, as they had to get along without him for 10 years or more and is facing major trouble to find his place in the new Germany. Only in a long and painful process he can fit into his role, culminating in a trip with his younger Boy to the final in Bern, Switzerland, where the boys hero (and preferred father figure as to then) scores the winning goal upon his appearance. This makes the story a lot more heart warming and connected to life compared to the however great impersonation Kurt Russel does. Where the miracle is however stronger, is to show, what are the fundamentals of such miracles : After a lackadaisical test game he lets his boys do the drill (sprinting up and down from goal- to middle line) even when the janitor cuts of the power and the light. He continues until the lights of his boys go out literally....",Null,1,2,4 August 2004
The Usual Suspects," 1001
","Hi, i am just writing this comment to be #1001 commenting here. I need to check out, whether other top 25 titles got a similar high number of comments later. I didn't know what the movie was about when first watching, but it is hard not to like it and be fascinated. And even after knowing the twist, i can easily watch it again and try to find the twists and turns, that should have made me aware of the real story and the real identities. I will not disclose anything here, as you should simply watch yourself, listen, look and learn. Stay away from trivia and goofs until you have gone thru the full movie twice. A very good test whether you can keep focus and intensity beyond the duration of the normal You Tube video.",9,0,0,19 July 2010
Zulu," Great Movie --> no questions asked
","This movie was recently replayed on HBO Asia and it shows the bravery of the English Soldiers being outnumbered 40:1 by enemy Zulus, who (in the movies as well as in history) had just slaughtered a unit of 1.500 Soldiers just before. The movies shows a cast of 'british Allstars' the likes of Stanley Baker, Trevor Howard, Michael Caine still in his early days and familiar faces like John Booth and others. It is impressive, well-crafted, gripping and futile. Definitely a masterpiece of British Film documenting a heroic past long gone. However, the question the film (and none of the actors even in greatest desperation) does not ask is, what in all the world did they do there ? Defending Great Britain, the Empire, Queen Victoria ?? What was their business killing the local people, be they hostile or not ? Possible too much to ask to early for a Film of 1964. I would hope, such questions would be raised in a remake, if it ever to come. Nevertheless 7 of 10 for the 'pure' artistic merit th movie definitely has.",7,0,7,3 September 2005
Downfall," Every now and then, Germany gets out a movie that stands out
","Films about Hitler are always in the dilemma of how to show this inconceivable character, as a crazy maniac, a hatred low level or what ever, risking to make him look human or to blow the chance of showing him as he possibly was. The film sticks reasonably with the credentials given by Traudl Junge, Hitlers private secretary and other eye witnesses of the final days of Hitler. There are two levels of story telling here, on the one side the strange, unreal isolated world of the 'Bunker' into which Hitler retreats when the Russians are taking Berlin, and, on the other hand, the real life, well depicted in gripping battle scenes, army hospitals and interwoven to a no longer 'civil' life of people being forced to arms or being hanged or becoming 'collateral damage' in the fight. Confronted are the end time mood dominating Hitlers bandwagon of Generals, Party Leaders and other strange fellows surrounding him against the useless death of regular soldiers, Volkssturm people and Hitler Youth, with their fanatical will to turn the tide that finally rolls over them. Bruno Ganz, naturally, has the 'best' role here, showing Hitler in a variety, from going berserk on bad news to being almost private as well as tangling himself and his entourage into phantasm of Army groups to relieve him, which have long ceased to exist as fighting units. Also impressive a long cast of German character actors, Corinna Harfouch as the mother taking the live of their 5 children, which shall not face a time without Hitler and National Socialism certainly standing out. Highly impressive, very well done to the small details, this movie can well hold up against any American Movie of the same budget both in quality as well as box office value. Once more a film, that made me happy to have been saved from the terrors of the world wars by the mercy of late birth. 9/10.",9,0,3,3 September 2005
Stalag 17," Droppen Sie dead !
","This is by all means the funny and entertaining version of the POW camp, much less sombre, depressing and hopeless as it is shown in King Rat, similar by location and topic and the ways of the main character. It goes almost close to vaudeville and musical, with the two guys doing the strange show, one wearing his underwear only mostly all of the time. This is some fun, but it has various undertones and a harsh side opening in the scene, when the 2 guys trying to escape are mowed down relentlessly and with an unbelievable amount of ammo being wasted. And it continues, when the assumed traitor is beaten up and threatened by his comrades, but comes to detect the real stoolie and his ways. And it get's deadly serious once more, when a captured pilot is at risk of being shot as a saboteur and must be brought out, still with a traitor trailing every step of the way. The Spoiler tick mark doesn't entitle you to know the final outcome, so go and watch it yourself.",8,1,5,25 September 2005
Saints and Soldiers," Holds well between Band of Brothers and When Trumpets fade
","This is a well thought out and done piece of 2nd world war, placed at the Battle of the Bulge, which seems to fascinate American Movie people in a way, that it was a near defeat of the American Army never expected and only prevented by strong will to hold out in dire circumstances until relieved by Patton and better whether allowing air superiority to kick in. This however, is an almost 'private' affair, a small group of already captured soldiers escaping from Prisonship, collecting on the way a shot-down or crashed pilot with an important message, which strengthens their need to get back to their own lines. There are a lot of small event, only 2 major fighting events but also a lot of good character study. Good to know, that American movie making has a lot to offer in this area, next to the superb Band of Brothers and the surprising sleeper 'When Trumpets Fade'. Seems to run regularly on HBO, and is also on DVD. Don't miss when you can get it.",7,2,5,5 September 2005
