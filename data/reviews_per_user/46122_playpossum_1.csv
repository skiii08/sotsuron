","Spellbinding Horror with a provocative twist set in a realistic urban scene. Tremendous images, cuts to the bone of gut life.  Truly the most under shown film of the new millennium.  A must see for all young impressionable people that might be thinking of taking a walk on the Wild side of Life. Should be mandatory viewing for all secondary level students.  A great film for all to see and learn from in a most horrific manner.",10,0,0,16 January 2001
