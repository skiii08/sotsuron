Casablanca," Does God Exist ?
","We seemingly live in an absurd , and alas ,pointless cosmos. Entropy makes the past poignantly and maddeningly irretrievable and rudimentary inductive logic {90% of all persons who have ever lived are now no more] persuades us that our loved ones are mortal.Yet in 1942 when the NAZI armies and Japanese militarists were unquestionably invincible there was in 'CASABLANCA' chanteuse Madeline Le Beau, there was S.Z. Sakall, Dooley Wilson, Sydney Greenstreet, Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt, Leonid Kinsky,John Qualen {Berger] and the inconceivable Peter Lorre. {also in the cast were Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman , and Humphrey Bogart}.These phenomena challenge the notion that we cogitate in a pointless and absurd realm. The above beings transcended and challenged the notion of the absurdity of the cosmos.",10,1,3,29 May 2002
Lifeboat," Let's here it for our putative deity
","Colleagues and folks:  If a deity exists there were two anguished choices. We could have a world including a film -drama by one Alfred Hitchcock; entited perhaps 'lifeboat' ,included in the cast might have been, Tallulah Bankhead, Wm Bendix, John Hodiak 'whom death may have claimed early' Heather Angel, Hume Cronyn, Canada Lee and several other worthy players.{Not the least of whom was the incomparable and eventually suicidal Walter Slezak' Whatever defamation and denouncement is appropriately due such a deity , we believe she is due praise for deigning to have Hitchcock  film 'lifeboat'.",10,2,6,7 May 2003
Citizen Kane," Betrayal
","Everett Sloan and Josph Cotton were certainly among the most accomplished actors and excellent of their's or any era. If Orson Welles intended a slovenly spoof upon us in Citizen Kane he should have chosen less worthy victims. This is a magnificent achievement and dares us to think if ROSEBUD exceeds all bathetic else that does ensue.We think the past insuperable, magnificenet, irretrievable and which did inspire Welles to attempt it's achievement in Citizen Kane. We think he failed; the past is irretrievable and genius cannot rescue it.",9,0,2,21 May 2003
12 Angry Men," Beyond 10
","We hardly disesteem the evaluative process we are here about; however, to assign this magnificently written, directed and acted work seems to us to act unjustly. Our system does not permit an 11+ {I'm advised an additional 4th line is required and so it is gratuitously here inscribed",10,0,1,8 January 2003
Gone with the Wind," 'But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate this hallowed ground
","I never seen Tara or Miss Scarlett O'Hara but our unit skirted TWELVE OAKS and I waved to Mr Ashley Wilkes. Everytime we met up with Yankees , cavalry or foot, they seemed to crumble and skedaddle. Having come up the beauteous and bountiful Shenandoah valley in early summer of 1863, we were advised that Hill's advanced brigades on July 1 and Longstreet's mighty corps on July 2nd had not been quite able to dislodge the stubborn Yankees and their vaunted Iron Brigade, consisting of dauntless but hardly literate Irish immigrants. We were honored therefore to be assigned to join the division of Major George E. Pickett. Our forces unleashed a devastating and certainly lethal artillery barrage upon the Yankee center on July 3rd and with whoops of confident victory did begin the mile-plus gentle ascent up the meadow to the Yankee bastions.I feared not for my own fate, harkening back to the proud and principled upringing my loving mother had conferred.I was barely deterred when a Yankee minnie-ball tore my left clavicle...brave and valiant cries urged us on...then all went dark.",Null,0,0,20 May 2003
The Pianist," A benevolent deity cannot exist
","If our probabalistic quantum-fluctuation cosmos could have any meaning, all fears of such are put to rest by 'The Pianist'. The ultimate triumph of the valorous human spirit , which we celebrate and marvel at, is the blind , insensate product of random chance and circumstance.  But are we not deeply affected. I,m advised director Polanski is a fugitive from pending charges of cogent merit: further I thought he had his 'Mona Lisa' in 'CHINATOWN'. At any rate,indicted or not, his works give a larger significance to our scrabbling existence on the surface of this planet, which orbits an undistinguished star amid hundreds of billions of stars.",Null,0,0,27 May 2003
The Graduate," Hindu ascetics and Buddist anchorites
","When last formally convened, the above posited that the best and only way that Katharine Ross in the Graduate could be justly appreciated is with a spoon. The acting of Dustin Hoffman, Buck Henry and Anne Bancroft does not admit of any comparisons we would here venture. A couple of magnificent numbers by Simon and Garfunkel including that which hauntingly beseeeches '...where have you gone Joe Dimaggio..' adds grace and charm to that which needs it not.",Null,0,1,2 May 2003
Paths of Glory," My soul is stunned and appalled
","Yes, we live in a world where guiltless gargantuan killer whales, deftly and with agile grace do belly-flop in shallow surf to gulp down baby seals. We cogitating folks live in a more convoluted , subtle world wherein Generals of France ,in elegant splendour and impeccable grace,amid backdrops or Versaille opulence, do with grace and decorum bandy about the most recent or next upcoming carnage with a gelid cynicism of soul that gives evil a bad name. Colonel Dax is impelled to ameliorate the random executions of three soldiers from a unit that did not accomplish a known impossible mission.The darwinian ruthlessness of fate and injustice selects three souls for death {souls as inept, mystified by existence and perplexed as we all.} Perhaps the only humane moment occurs when one of the condemed squashes a cockroach to appease a fellow condemed who decried that the insect on the morrow would have a more robust connection with the deceased's wife than he. Kubrick merits kudos and Adolph Menjou and George MacCready are terror for our souls as the mannerred French Generals. This is an 11.",10,4,9,12 May 2003
From Here to Eternity," colleagues and fellow mortals pray attend
","Were you not thrilled in August of 1953 upon the release of From Here To Etenity. Did not the scene of embrace in the rocky surf cause the auricles and ventricles of your heart to quicken? The magnificience of Montgomery Clift, Ernest Borgnine , Frank Sinatra et.al and so many others  deserve commendation. But did this scene not quicken  our pulse and leave us a tad transcended ? Are we paltry in heart and intellect or can we not like Shakespeare aspire to state our aspirations and recognition of our fiendesh and meagre limits. Colleagues , we can maybe, do as well and better.",Null,0,0,30 April 2003
