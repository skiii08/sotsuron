The Ring," A truly brilliant and gripping film.
","The Ring is a brilliant and gripping film which thriller fans will adore.The story begins after Rachel Keller's (Naomi Watts) niece is found dead, with no explanation for the death. It would appear that her heart just stopped. But the girl's mother asks Rachel, who is a journalist, to try and figure out why she really died. What Rachel discovers is that her niece, along with the three other friends of hers, watched a video tape exactly seven days prior to when they all died simultaneously.The Ring has a rating of MA15+, and it earned it. This is a very scary film that will have you on tenterhooks the whole way through its many twists and turns, but is not exceptionally gory, nor are things jumping out at the central characters every few minutes. The film is scary because of the creepy way it goes about things, letting you only have another piece of the puzzle that Rachel is presented. But the frightening imagery that the film uses makes it creepier then the story would have been. The scenes that stay with you especially are Rachel's encounter with a horse, her final meeting with Richard Morgan, the owner of a horse ranch on Moesko Island, and the gripping finale.But, the powerful imagery doesn't only come in the forms of scares. Certain scenes, like one simple scene where Rachel stands on her apartment's balcony and looks out at other people's lives gives us a snapshot into other people's lives, just showing that everyone you see has a tale to tell, something different from the last, and that people always have secrets.This film for me doesn't come under the 'horror' category, but rather the 'thriller' category, even though it is a very frightening piece of cinema. It is a classic, and even though it's a very scary piece of film, it's easily recommendable.",9,1,2,2 April 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Ground-breaking cinema at its finest.
","One of the most annoying complaints people had for the first film was about the ending. Well, if any of them was a little more interested in it then they would have learned that it was, in fact, a trilogy. Well, duh!The film picks up exactly where the film left off, with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli racing off to try and save their hobbit friends, Merry and Pippin from the fearsome Uruk-Hai who have them in their grasp, and are racing back to Isengard with them for their master, the wizard Saruman, who believes that the two hobbits have the One Ring, which he hopes to get for himself. Saruman betrayed everything he once fought for to join Sauron, but even so, he is subtly trying to make Sauron fall. Our other hobbits, Frodo and Sam, are journeying ever closer to Mordor with each new day, where their journey will end only once Frodo has destroyed the One Ring. But, quickly into the film, the pair capture the creature Gollum, whom they take as their guide to get to Mordor. Is Gollum trustworthy? Who knows. In years gone past, he had possession of the One Ring, and that indeed was the reason he was caught: he was trying to reclaim the Ring for himself. Will his evil alter-ego finally take control of his consciousness? Or will he revert to his former self, Smeagol?With so many people searching for the One Ring, the chances aren't good for Frodo ever making it to Mordor. But if he doesn't, and the Ring goes back to it's master, Sauron, then all of Middle-earth is doomed. This is part of the defining trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, and while all films in the trilogy were critically acclaimed, this received the most acclaim. Personally, I think that the director, Peter Jackson, has saved the best till last, with the Return of the King.But, all of the three films are as good as it gets, and this one is certainly no exception. The stunning special effects thanks to WETA workshops render every orc, troll and other beast that appears in this movie utterly believable. The beautiful landscapes that are the backdrop of this film also give it its credibility. Without doubt, if it had been shot in a studio, there would be no comparison between the two. New Zealand will forever now be considered as Middle-Earth. In shortÂ—groundbreaking cinematic history. It'll be awhile before something quite like this ever pops up again.",9,0,2,4 April 2008
