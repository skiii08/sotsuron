Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I was very surprised!
","Oh yes, I was really surprised, when I saw the film the first time, because everything I heard before made me think of it like it would be a film especially for children. But now I like the film, I am 23 years old, like I have learned to love the three other great adventures in a galaxy far far away.",10,0,0,15 July 1999
