Requiem for a Dream," A joke
","This thing is a joke. I've was a heroin addict for nearly five years. And yeah, it's not a good life, but it's not like this. The appliances never attack you and if you have the drugs life isn't all that bad. I never became a thief, and I never beat people up for money, and I never sold my ass (If I'd been selling no one would have been buying.) Sure, there are drugs that will turn you into some sort of raving psychotic lunatic, but alcohol is worse for you than heroin.Frankly, I liked heroin and I highly recommend it as an occasional thing.I do not recommend being a junkie, it's too expensive, but 4 times a year for partying is fine. What they tell you about how addictive it is is a lie. It's not that bad. It just isn't.",1,4,10,12 December 2006
