The King's Speech," The King's Speech is, simply, Eloquent
","Most of the other reviewers have already summed up what it is about, so I will just say this; I saw this film almost by accident-- my initial first choice was another movie, and I usually don't tend to get too excited about historical and period works. So I nearly passed on this one. Boy, would that ever have been a HUGE mistake! Colin Firth invests the character of the Duke of York (later King George VI) as a man facing a debilitating impediment, with not only humanity and warmth but an incredible sense of humor as well. The relationship between himself and the speech therapist Lionel Logue, at the heart of the story, is movingly portrayed. I was truly, utterly blown away. Do yourself a favor this holiday season, and DON'T miss this one!",9,0,1,27 December 2010
