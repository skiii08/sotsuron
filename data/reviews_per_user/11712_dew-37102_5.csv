It," Reminded me a lot of Nightmare on Elm Street
","This movie is obviously an 80s throwback, and being a fan of 80s movies, I had a lot of fun watching this one. Now, I'm in my mid-20s so I'm not afraid of cgi clowns. But I found the characters likable enough even if some of them were a bit grating at times and the spoooooky parts were creative enough to be at least interesting if not scary.My only major complaint is that the film gets really repetitive and the scenes are sort of awkwardly crammed together sometimes. Overall though, I was pleasantly surprised and I'd recommend seeing it at least once. It's not spectacular but I enjoyed it for what it was.",7,1,8,9 September 2017
It Follows," Starts great, but I was laughing by the end
","Everyone has praised this film's premise and execution and I will say that I found it creepy until I started thinking about it. If it could look like anything, why would it look like an old lady or a brutal rape victim or a giant man? You know, the most obvious things it could possibly be? Still, it was unique and well made so I was willing to overlook that... until it got to the beach scene. How anyone made it through this scene without laughing is beyond me.So the characters decide to run to a beach house and just hang out there waiting for it to arrive. When it finally does, it walks up behind the main character and... strangles her? No. Breaks her neck? No... it gently lifts her hair up... that is to say her hair magically rises into the air by itself. The other guy notices and tries to help her but gets punted right off the screen by nothing. It was seriously hilarious.But nothing topped the climax where it shows up looking like bearded Henry Cavill's Superman and their plan is to push it into a pool and throw toasters in to electrocute it. But instead, it just starts throwing the toasters at the people. Then one of the kids shoots one of the other kids and it was the funniest thing ever.I'd still recommend seeing it for its uniqueness, but seriously... HOW did anyone find this movie scary after that?",6,0,2,31 August 2017
Kong: Skull Island," If you took the big pile of triceratops poop from Jurassic Park...
","...and set it on fire with some leftover napalm from Apocalypse Now, you would get this movie.I was constantly confused by almost every choice made by the film makers and the characters. Can't wait for the inevitably terrible crossover films! Thanks WB!",4,0,1,24 June 2017
Wonder Woman," Has heart, but held back by tired 'super hero movie' tropes
","I enjoyed the movie overall and would recommend it for anyone, except young children, ironically. It has a sympathetic main character with a good arc and some decent action, but it does seem to be borrowing heavily from Captain America. Set during a Great War, stars a hunky blonde guy played by an actor named Chris, centers around a character with a black and white sense of morality slowly learning that there's some gray area in the real world, and has a big dumb ending with a silly villain and lots of explosions. They also rip off the sacrifice scene even though it makes no sense as long as a functioning parachute was on board the plane... and why wouldn't one be?After the dust settles, Wonder Woman was really just another decent super hero movie to add to the pile. If you aren't totally sick of those yet, give it a watch. It has a girl, so it's different I guess.",7,1,6,31 August 2017
Alien: Covenant," Try seeing it as a comedy
","This movie is basically Prometheus 2. It's another 'Alien' movie that focuses on the lore surrounding the Xenomorph because it knows that Xenomorphs themselves have been a dead end since 'Aliens.' If that lore interests you, then I'm sure you'll be pleased with some of the revelations in this movie. If you're like me and you couldn't care less about pale bald space men, I can still recommend this movie... as a comedy. There are some moments of pure slap-stick and plenty of death by face-palm-inducing stupidity. If you're the kind of person who enjoys watching idiots get what's coming to them, then you'll probably like this movie.",6,6,15,20 May 2017
