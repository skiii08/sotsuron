The Ring," Great Horror Flick!
","This film was excellent. The story was great, the acting was amazing, and what can I say of the movie as a whole, nothing less than perfect. I must admit I had to see it twice to actually get it, but after that I couldn't stop watching it. It feels as if this movie sucks you into it and makes you become involve. I recommend this great movie to anyone who wants to be scared and I give it a 9.",9,1,1,13 March 2003
