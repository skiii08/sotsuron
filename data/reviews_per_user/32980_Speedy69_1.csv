Skyfall," The music and the much beloved DB5
","A quick note for the car lovers. Please note the car is spelt Aston Martin and not Astin or Austin-thank you.The times and Bond may have moved on, but this was a really weak film. No wit, no humour, no charm, no fun and the action scenes don't conjure up much suspense or excitement. Why did spending $200 million the end result came out so lame andfairly boring. If there was a sanistised and political corrected film , this was it.Two questions: 
1) Was it intentional to have such a p8ss poor orchestral score with no sense of anticipation,depth,suspense or meaning? Part of watching any Bond film IS to have these dramatic musical injections into a scene.2) Was blowing up the DB5 really neccessary or was it to sybolically and finally kill off any connections with the 'old' style Bond. Regardless of how the films have developed over the years that iconic car should have remained. Ever since being a boy and watching Goldfinger at the Cinema that DB5 stood out as THE Bond car. They have all but killed off any future Bond film that comes out thereafter. Enough said.",Null,2,6,8 May 2018
