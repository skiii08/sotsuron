Your Name.," A totally disappointing Makoto's movie
","A really disappointing animation by Shinkai Makoto. I used to love his work like '5 Centimeters Per Second' but this time he created a mass of kitsch. Yes the animation is beautiful but it can't tell the story. 'Your Name.' is just a bad taste anime to entertain the audience, and show how Makoto lost his own vision and style to made a popular popcorn movie (like Michael Bay did). The thing I can't stand the most is how the people keep hyping this movie (even Makoto told people do not go to the theater watch this movie). The main characters are empty. They didn't have a real interaction, I cannot understand why the people think this is emotional. Okay maybe the emotion doesn't really need to be rational but I hardly feel the characters' mind. At the end, the story cannot express any feeling (the music is not suitable for the mood too).In conclude, the whole anime is disappointing. The reason is not about how bad it is, it's about how Makoto fail to be an artist, and a stylist he could be.",1,7,34,23 August 2018
