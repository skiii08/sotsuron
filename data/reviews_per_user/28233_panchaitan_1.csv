The Expendables 2," This is a big disappointment
","The Expendables 2 turned out to be a big disappointment for me. I felt right from the first 10-20 minutes that now there will be something impressive & by half-time I felt when will this movie end. Really, one expects 'quality' stuff from legends like Stallone, Bruce, Arnold. But the outcomes were very predictable. I saw it in an encoded 4.5 GB Blu-ray 720p version & I expected I was on for one and half hour of extreme & 'quality' action. These legends indeed proved that they should now be in a museum. I am very disappointed. :-( The Expendables 1 had some new & quality stuff in it & the action scenes were indeed good. In this movie, one can feel that the screenplay lagged something. It forced me to think that the screenplay is actually that of a B-grade movie sometimes. I don't know why the movie has got 7.4 votes but I think it's mostly to do with the presence of such college of legends. Indeed 7.4 is very less if one imagines a film to have such a collegium. It may have to do with Ego or something that you can't bring so many legends in one movie.",2,2,4,10 October 2012
