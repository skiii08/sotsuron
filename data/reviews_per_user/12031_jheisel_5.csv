The Blair Witch Project," This is the scariest movie I have ever seen.
","Without a doubt, this movie will frighten you. As we walked home from the theater, we began getting freaked out.Then we decided we needed to drink ourselves to sleep, but the liquor stores were closed.So we decided to drive to another city to see if they sold liquor past 1, and we just ended up freaking ourselves out more.So yeah.The scariest movie ever.",10,5,9,31 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Simply put: The funniest movie I've seen in a long time.
","The last episode of South Park I saw I actually turned off halfway through. It was so bad, I wasn't laughing at anything. So I was a bit wary to see this movie. Then I saw good reviews everywhere, and figured I might as well check it out. And boy am I happy I did! South Park is probably one of the funniest movies to come out in 1999. You know the story, so there's no point on going over it. South Park's creators basically engage in a hilarious self-parody of everything that has happened to South Park and the protests that can be expected from the movie. I've heard more swearing in this movie than I have anywhere else in my life, I think. Some of it seems to just be thrown in for the shock value of hearing little kids saying four letter words, but much of it is pertinent to how kids talk, and very funny. The film also makes fun of the MPAA, among others, with the line, 'You can kill as many people as you want in your movie, but you can't use bad language!' I recommend this movie to everyone on the planet with a sense of humor.",10,0,0,3 July 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," ...Not as bad as I remember it being...
","I just got done watching From Dusk Til Dawn on TV, and I've got to say, it was much better than when I watched it on video a few year's back at a friend's house. While George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino's acting jobs were utterly horrendous, Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel, as usual, were fantastic. However, they could not save this movie. It has an incredibly thin plot, and no character development. I must say the censors at Fox did a great job taking out all the breasts and swearing. I seem to remember Clooney saying three four letter words for every normal word. And the name of the bar on TV was the Kitty Twister, and I seem to remember it being named something *slightly* different when I saw it on video. If it really did have that slightly different name in the uncensored movie, one must really give credit to Fox' censors, as even the LOGO for the bar said Kitty Twister. From Dusk Til Dawn is a bad movie. Unfortunately it takes itself far too seriously to even be laughably bad. Fortunately Fox had the good nature to intersperse the film with commercials every 10 minutes to break up the monotony. On video you won't be quite so lucky. Avoid this.",3,1,2,4 July 1999
Bring It On," I didn't expect much, and this film delivered!
","Low expectations are often a great thing. I was flipping through the channels tonight and since Bring It On was just about to start, I figured I might as well start watching it. I mean, hey, cheerleaders, right?Anyway, the plot is somewhat interesting as an idea, but while I never found myself bored, I never found myself fully interested in the story either. BIO is the sort of movie that just whizzes by and before you know it, it's done.That said, some of the cheerleading scenes are very well choreographed and I'll definitely be watching Nationals for the uh, athletic skills of these young women. Yeah.",4,0,1,4 April 2001
The Sixth Sense," This is the most overrated movie I've seen all summer!
","My friends had all told me that the Sixth Sense was an incredible movie.Some even told me it was better than Blair Witch Project.So, since I had some free passes to the movies, I took my friend Cathy to see it last night.The first 100 minutes or so passed at an incredibly boring pace. Nothing much seemed to happen at all.After being shot by a former patient, child psychologist Bruce Willis decides to help a child who shows the same symptoms that this patient did. At the loss of his family life, he throws himself into helping this boy who can see dead people. That's the basic premise. Boring, I say.The movie plods along at a snail's pace, and the lines are tired cliches, ie: Bruce Willis: 'My plan is blah blah blah'. Boy: 'Will it work?' Bruce: 'I don't know...'Give me a break! Come up with something original! The idea of seeing dead people is pretty interesting, and they could've done something cool with it, but instead you get 100 minutes of boring film stock and tired cliches for dialogue and plot movement. The filmmakers even employed the standard 'shocking' music to get you to jump at the slightest 'gross' thing, things that weren't even scary.In the final 2 or 3 minutes, the film pulls itself together and comes up with a completely amazing ending that made me not hate the film. It did, however, make me angry for not hating the film, and left me wishing that I had left in the middle of the movie so I could have been left with a feeling of utter disappointment.In a summer of movies like American Pie, Blair Witch Project, South Park, Eyes Wide Shut, and Austin Powers 2, maybe I just had too high of expectations. Don't waste your money on this crapfest.",3,1,1,29 August 1999
