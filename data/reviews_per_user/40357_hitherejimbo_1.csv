Casablanca," The various reasons I identify with and love this movie.
","Having lingered too long as a student in Europe and then had an  exciting escape via Lisbon in 1940 I really identified with the 'refugee characters' when I saw 'Casablanca' when it first came out in 1942. I have watched it countless times since and never tire of it.   The characters are like old friends and it is fun to anticipate the dialogue.  So much of it has crept into the language ('I'm shocked, shocked...')   Although most critics list 'Casablanca' as the second greatest American movie after 'Citizen Kane' I would reverse the order.  I admired 'Citizen Kane' for its artistry but love 'Casablanca' for its heart.   And the best scene in this best movie is where Paul Henreid leads everyone in the singing of the 'Marseillaise' to drown out the Nazi singing of Conrad Veidt and his friends.   I love France and every year on Bastille Day, July 14th, France's Fourth of July, I play this segment   Advice to Hollywood.  You have made so many ghastly remakes of classics (e.g. 'Stage Coach','Lost Horizon', 'The Razor's Edge,')  DON'T YOU DARE REMAKE 'CASABLANCA'.",Null,0,0,20 March 2002
