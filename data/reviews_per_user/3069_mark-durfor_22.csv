10 Cloverfield Lane," Mysterious Thriller Delivers on Vague Preview
","10 Cloverfield Lane is exactly why I love doing these previews and reviews. The movie begins, just as the preview suggests, with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) getting into a pretty bad car accident. When she awakens, she is handcuffed to a wall in a bunker. Her captor, or savior, Howard (John Goodman) informs her that it's not safe outside of the bunker. Emmett (John Gallagher Jr) is also in the bunker and appears to be Howard's friend, or co-captor. It takes a little while to reveal this, but Emmett helped Howard build the bunker and begged to be let in when whatever happened outside the bunker happened. Michelle attempts to escape despite Howard's fervent pleas that he is doing this for her own good.The movie was directed by Dan Trachtenberg who really hasn't done much before this release. I love me some John Goodman. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has been around, but isn't a big name actress. She was in A Good Day to Die Hard as John McClane's daughter Lucy and was in a cute film Scott Pilgrim vs. The World as Romona Flowers, Scott's love interest. There's actually a scene in the movie that Die Hard fans will be waiting for Michelle to say, 'Come out to the coast, have a few laughs.' If you don't know what I mean, you aren't a true Die Hard fan. Spoiler alert, she doesn't say it.My point is, you know you're going to get something great from John Goodman and JJ Abrams, but the rest of the cast and crew, along with the preview, leave you wondering what exactly that something is. It's wonderful. It looks like a great thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat and also guessing as to the true motives of Howard and Emmett in the bunker. I had no idea what I was about to get into, but I was excited to see 10 Cloverfield Lane. Just like the ambiguous trailer, the movie itself keeps you guessing as to Howard's true intentions and what, if anything, really happened outside the bunker. It has twists and turns and the last half hour had me saying, 'Wait, what?' 'No way' and 'What the what?' at least 5 times. I anticipated 4.0 stars for a well-written, well-acted, twisting scary movie that I might just want to buy and watch again, and I'm sticking with that. Well worth it and might just add this one to my collected, but definitely want to see again.",8,3,4,21 June 2016
Deepwater Horizon," Deepwater Horizon Is Explosive
","In April of 2010, an offshore drilling rig named Deepwater Horizon exploded resulting in the worst oil spill in U. S. History. If you've read my previous reviews about Eddie the Eagle, Steve Jobs, The Big Short and Spotlight, you know that it's easy to get caught up in the details of how much of the story based on actual events really happened and how much was embellished or altered to make a Hollywood movie. Along the way, I have made a decision to do no research into the facts of the real-life story and just focus solely on the movie itself. I mean, the movie makes no claims to be a historically accurate documentary, so I shouldn't hold it to those standards. And this blog isn't about movies being historically accurate when they don't necessarily claim to be. It's based on two factors: how accurately the movie is portrayed by its preview, and the likelihood of the movie making it to my home collection. With that in mind, here's my review:Mark Wahlberg plays Mike Williams who works on the drilling rig the Deepwater Horizon. But that's the third thing we learn about Williams from the preview. He's a husband and a father first. He says goodbye to his family before being flown by helicopter with his crew to the rig. All his daughter wants is a dinosaur fossil. All his wife (Kate Hudson) wants is for him to return safely. Once aboard the rig, an executive named Vidrine (John Malkovich) and others from British Petroleum are more than anxious to commence with drilling. They skip a concrete test and excuse a failed system test. They are already 43 days behind and over budget and will do whatever it takes to not fall further behind despite Mister Jimmy's (Kurt Russell) stern objections. They should have listened to Mister Jimmy because everyone's worst nightmares explode into reality. Deepwater Horizon marks the reunion of Director Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg who collaborated on Lone Survivor three years ago. It was nominated for Oscars for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing and won the Screen Actors Guild Award for best stunt team performance. While Wahlberg has been nominated for his roles in The Fighter and The Departed, he's one of those reliable actors who makes smart choices. If you've liked one thing Wahlberg has done, odds are,you'll like them all. Most of them won't get nominated for awards, but they will all be entertaining. Berg is in the same category. He's directed some really good movies (Lone Survivor, Battleship, Hancock,The Kingdom), but none that would really break into a critic's top 50 list. Like Wahlberg, if you enjoyed one of Berg's movies, odds are, you'll at least feel you got your money's worth with all of them. From the preview, I said that Deepwater Horizon looked action-packed and visually stunning, but that it also looked predictable with pieces of the rig falling apart or blowing up blocking every turn as Williams and the survivors try to find a way to escape. I anticipated 3 Stars but I'm bumping that up to 4.0 Stars. It was exactly as the preview said it would be and it was absolutely predictable; however, even though you knew what was coming, it was so perfectly executed, it still shocked you. From the beginning, there was no doubt about the fate of the rig as not-so-subtle clues were dropped along the way from his daughter's school presentation, to the tie of the executive, to the helicopter ride to the rig. You knew it was going to happen, but when it did, it choked the breath right out of you and didn't give it back until the very end of the movie. It is worth the money to watch in theatres. Though I'm not sure I'll be owning Deepwater Horizon, I will be watching it again.",8,48,80,27 September 2016
John Wick," Like Neesan in Taken or Stallone in Get Carter, Reeves is perfect in this revenge thriller
","http://marksmoviemind.blogspot.com///john-wick-review.html This movie delivers everything the preview claims it will deliver and once again Keanu Reeves has picked the perfect movie for his acting abilities. The dialogue is limited and there are some good one-liners throughout, but most of it is action. The only criticism I can make, that I noted in my preview, is that some of the gun fights are a little unrealistic. Wick has been out of the scene for 5 years now and makes some comments throughout the movie that he is 'rusty' when he shows up at places with some battle wounds. Yet, when it comes to the gun fights, his aim is dead on perfect while his opponents couldn't hit water if they fell off the Titanic in the middle of the ocean.When Viggo is telling his son about John Wick, he tells the story of a Russian folklore character called the Boogeyman. His son laughs at the idea of Wick being that man and Viggo tells him that Wick is worse, he's the one you send in to kill the Boogeyman. There are two important lessons about being John Wick. First, as I mentioned before referring to the posters for the movie, 'don't set him off'. And these unapologetic punks do just that. The second lesson is don't burn your bridges. In sprite of what John Wick was and what he did, he made some powerful allies and lived by a certain code that helped him many times throughout the movie. It's this code that is more powerful than money that kept Wick alive and helped him to exact his revenge.I predicted 3.5 stars and I'm going to keep that rating. The preview perfectly sets you up for precisely what the movie is. Like Liam Neeson in Taken or Sylvester Stallone in Get Carter, Reeves is the perfect actor to portray John Wick and is believable and enjoyable in the role. It is extremely violent and graphic, but it is also fun and humorous at times. My friend, Nick, feels this is one that should definitely be purchased for a home collection. I'm not sure I'd go that far, but I do think it was worth the price of admission in the theatre and one I would readily watch again when it is available for rent. So, what movie will be on my mind next? We shall see.",7,5,14,19 November 2014
Darkest Hour," Oldman gives Oscar-worthy performance in otherwise dull film
","In the 1930s, Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) spearheaded the efforts to warn about the dangers of Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Germany. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was forced into retirement in May of 1940 when Parliament grew tired of his lack of leadership, foresight and results against the impending War. Churchill replaced Chamberlain as Prime Minister of Great Britain, in the early days of World War II. In the early stages of the war in 1940 and 1941, the British Empire was nearly alone in their opposition to Hitler, and Churchill's speeches and radio broadcasts were a source of inspiration in this dark time. One of his most famous and inspirational speeches included 'we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.'Darkest Hour is the historical story of the early days of World War II as Hitler began his conquest of Western Europe. Churchill had warned about this and now Great Britain was all but solitary in their defiance of the Nazis. A peace treaty was proposed and it was now up to Churchill to decide what to do. According to the treaty, Hitler would stop his war with Western Europe provided that Great Britain did not interfere with his plans to move east and conquer the USSR. Churchill was never a fan of the treaty and felt that bold retaliation, standing their ground against the Nazis, would be their only hope of true survival. But, Churchill faced a lack of support from his own party, and even felt the pressure to not only entertain the idea of the treaty, but to accept it or face his own removal as Prime Minister. While battling with his doubts about the treaty, his doubts about the chances of Great Britain's survival whether they signed the treaty or not, and his own doubts about his ability to properly discern what was best for his country, Churchill took his fears and doubts to the people. They overwhelmingly expressed their disdain for the Nazis and their resolve to never give in. Thus, Churchill rejected the offer. Director Joe Wright is no stranger to epic historical and moving stories as he has already tackled Pride & Prejudice, Anna Karenina, and Atonement which earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Directing in 2008. While Atonement did win for Best Picture, Wright lost out to Julian Schnabel who directed The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. While neither Darkest Hour nor Joe Wright have been nominated for a Golden Globe, Oldman has been nominated for his portrayal of Winston Churchill, and an Oscar nomination is all but guaranteed as he pulled of one of those rare performances where you do not see the actor on the screen, but rather their character come to life. While all the actors who have been nominated and won an Oscar over the last two decades have deserved their recognition, perhaps the most notable was Daniel Day-Lewis's win in 2013 for his performance as Abraham Lincoln. Oldman accomplishes the same brilliant execution. Not once did I notice that it was Gary Oldman, but rather I saw nothing but Sir Winston Churchill in the movie Darkest Hour. It was inspired, flawless and genius.Unfortunately, for me, the rest of the movie just didn't hold up to Oldman's efforts. I expected Wright's latest work to be a moving, gripping and tense look behind the scenes of the early days of World War II. I had high expectations for Darkest Hour and gave a 4 Star Prediction. To me, it was slow, uninspiring, dull and dragging, especially considering the film is about one man's decision in a time that effectively helped to lead his country and the world out of one of the darkest times in world history. It is worth watching, for Oldman's performance alone; however, if you haven't seen it already in the theatres, wait for it to come out for rent. It's definitely worth renting, and I might watch it again, but I'm pretty sure it won't find a home in my permanent collection. Therefore, I'm lowing my rating to 3 Stars. www.marksmoviemind.blogspot.com",6,0,2,5 January 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One Disappoints
","'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away . . .' Those iconic words lit up the screen for the eighth major Star Wars film, just a year after Episode VII: The Force Awakens revitalized the franchise with director J.J. Abrams calling the shots. Star Wars: Rogue One could also be called Episode 3.5 as it takes place approximately 20 years after Episode III ends and leads right into Episode IV: A New Hope. Rogue One was directed by English director Gareth Edwards who directed Monsters (an alien invasion sci-fi drama) and Godzilla in 2014. Both of those films boasted intense special effects which played into his Star Wars debut. A lot happened at the end of Episode III. Obi Wan fought and defeated his apprentice Anakin Skywalker who was burned by lava over most of his body. Anakin was saved and became the dark sith lord Darth Vader made up mostly of machine to keep him alive. He was seduced by the dark side for its potential power, namely that of saving his beloved wife Padme from death. However, Padme died giving birth to twins Luke and Leia. To hide them from Vader, Yoda and Obi Wan (the only remaining Jedi) and Bail Organa (one of the few Senators not deceived by Emperor Palpatine) determined their fate. Bail adopted Leia and raised her to be the princess of Alderaan. Luke was raised by his uncle Owen and aunt Beru Lars on the desert planet of Tatooine with Obi Wan keeping a distant but watchful eye. Rogue One is the story of Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones). As a child, she barely escaped a Stormtrooper attack on her planet. 15 years later, she is a criminal who finds herself in the captivity of the Rebellion. They promise her freedom if she can help find out what the Empire's plans are. In doing so, she learns her father was coerced into helping design the Death Star. This prompts Jyn to not only join the Rebels, but lead their mission to steal the plans to the planet-destroying weapon. The preview for Rogue One looked just as visually stunning as the recently released Episode VII. Of course, I was excited because it's a Star Wars movie and I was also curious to see who of our favorite classic Star Wars characters would make some sort of cameo appearance. We already knew Darth Vader was in the film. Unfortunately, two others showed up, but I'll get to that in a second. I had high hopes for Rogue One, though I cautiously gave it a 4 Star Prediction out of 5 stars. I had hoped that number would go up after seeing it; however, it looks like it's going to go down.If you don't want any spoilers, you should stop right here. Otherwise, here we go. Right from the beginning, a black screen displayed the blue words 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away . . . ' and then it jumped right into the movie. That's right, no scrolling yellow synopsis to let you know what's going to happen. Then, after the first scene, the title popped onto the screen with no traditional Star Wars theme music that was the score for all seven other movies. Next, the movie jumps from planet to planet it seemed every 5 minutes for the first half of the film. Since it jumped around so much, it was hard to keep track, except for the subtitle telling you where you were and what the significance was of its location. Every other Star Wars movie didn't need that because the dialogue effectively let you know where you were. Felicity Jones did great as Jyn Erso, however, like the movie itself, she had the unfortunate task of having to follow Daisy Ridley's performance as Rey in Episode VII and it fell a bit short. She was, however, one of the three bright spots in the movie among a sea of unmemorable characters. And the final gripe I had with Rogue One was the appearances of Princess Leia and Grand Moff Tarkin. So how did a 60 year old Carrie Fisher and a Peter Cushing who passed away 22 years ago reprise their roles? Computer animation. Really good computer animation, but still noticeable and distracting computer animation. Okay, enough with the downers. In addition to an entertaining performance from Felicity Jones, there were two other things that really made this worth watching. The droid K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk) was a security droid for the Empire before being reprogrammed to serve the Rebel Alliance. And he was programmed with a snarky personality that has clever one liners in the movie that made him quite endearing. The other scene that was probably the best scene in the whole movie was Darth Vader showing off what an angry Sith Lord can do with the dark side of the force. In his own words from Empire Strikes Back, it was 'impressive, most impressive.'So, I anticipated 4 Stars, but Rogue One was a bit of a letdown for me. I'm dropping it to 3.5 Stars as my final rating. It's worth watching in the theatre, but more of a rental. I'll definitely be owning it, but that's more because a Star Wars fan has to have all of them in their collection. If this was a stand alone movie, I doubt I would. That being said, it made me even more anxious to see Episode VIII next year.marksmoviemind.blogspot.com",6,7,14,24 December 2016
Creed," Creed a good Rocky Sequel
","Creed is the 7th movie in the Rocky franchise and this time the Italian Stallion is training the son of his former enemy turned best friend, Apollo Creed. Apollo died in Rocky IV during an exhibition match with a steroid-enhanced Soviet monster Ivan Drago. His son, Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan), wasn't even born. Today, he wants to follow in his late father's footsteps as a professional boxer. He seeks the help of the man his father fought, the man his father trained, the man who beat his father and the man who beat the Russian who killed his father, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). After some reluctance, Balboa agrees to train and mentor Adonis.Creed has several pieces of all the previous Rocky movies. The son of Apollo's glove man is now running Creed's gym. There's running down the streets of Philadelphia. Adonis has to deal with being the underdog and a much smaller opponent like in Rocky IV. He trains like Rocky did in Rocky I. He deals with adversity with his trainer like in Rocky III. He starts his training in Mickey's old gym in Philly and winds up completing his training in a rougher part of town, also a la Rocky III.Most of Creed is predictable except for three pretty big things, without giving too much away: First, Adonis is the son of Apollo, though not how you might initially think; second, Rocky is given a surprising twist in the movie; and finally, the big final fight. The most impressive part of the movie is Adonis' first professional fight with Rocky in his corner as his trainer. From the moment he walks into the ring, through the entire first round, through the break between rounds, and until the fight is over midway through the second round is all one continues camera shot. To get the action sequences and dialogue just right in one single take was extremely impressive.Creed is a really good continuation of the Rocky franchise. It was an enjoyable modern take on a 40 year classic. It didn't win any Oscars, though Stallone earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination. One could have made an argument for Johnson to be nominated for Best Actor, but this year was all about Leonardo finally getting his trophy anyway. It was worth the money to watch, entertaining, and I'll probably watch it again on TV, but most likely won't be making it to my home collection, so I'm sticking with my 3.0 Stars.",6,0,2,15 March 2016
Spotlight," Spotilght Slightly Underwhelms
","Spotlight refers to the group of investigative reporters who work for The Boston Globe. The group has been there since the 1970 and will often spend months working on a single story. In 2001, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) comes in from Florida as their new editor-in-chief and asks the current team to put their latest investigation on hold and look into allegations of a Catholic priest's sexual abuse against a minor and the potential cover-up. Retiring editor Walter 'Robbie' Robinson (Michael Keaton) and his team of reporters are hesitant at first, considering Baron to be an outsider just trying to stir things up. Eventually Robbie and his investigators Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) agree to the story and find the truth is much worse than one priest and one child.My only concern was the potential for deep lulls in the movie pulling the investigation and interviews together for their story over the course of the 2 hour and 8 minute film. The 'lulls' of the investigation were actually the driving points of the film. Each stone the team overturned revealed more abuses, more victims and more cover-up on what turned out to be a global scale. I gave Spotlight an anticipatory 3.5 stars as I had a feeling it would be entertaining, moving and bold, but probably one of those films that seeing it once or twice would be enough without feeling the need or desire to own it. I actually lowered it half a star. Again, it's tough to rate these movies on their creative license when they are based on true stories, however, the main purpose of these reviews is to gauge how accurately the film as portrayed in the preview. The preview for Spotlight made it seem like religious leaders, politicians, lawyers and more would be vehemently blocking the team's investigation and story at every turn. In truth, it really wasn't that difficult for them to find attorneys, victims, and even perpetrators who were willing to come forward to help them piece their story together. There was a lot of talk about how powerful the church was and the reach of their control with friends in influential places, but little action to that effect throughout their digging.Spotlight was, as anticipated, disgustingly moving and disturbing. It was well-written and brilliantly acted by the entire team, but a bit less dramatic than the preview lead me to believe. I enjoyed it, might watch it again, but most likely won't be making it to my home collection.",4,3,6,22 March 2016
Concussion," Will Smith Delivers in Concussion
","Mike Webster was a center for the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Kansas City Chiefs from 1974 to 1990. Nicknamed 'Iron Mike', some say Webster is the best center in NFL history. He died at the age of 50 and was the first NFL player to be diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease caused by multiple concussions. Concussion focuses on Nigerian pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) who first diagnosed Webster (David Morse) and embarked on a study of other NFL players. The results of his findings put him at odds with the NFL and some of his fellow doctors as his efforts to bring light to the problem are met with stiff competition to keep him quiet. Omalu, under the supervision of Dr. Cyril Wecht (Albert Brooks), believed the NFL would be pleased to hear of his discovery so they could prevent it from happening any more. Wecht believed Omalu would ultimately become an American hero. Instead, he was met with opposition from the NFL, from fellow doctors, and even received death threats against himself and his family, forcing Omalu to make the impossible decision to continue pressing for his findings to become public knowledge or to retreat for his safety and the safety of those he loves. Webster's death was officially reported as being due to heart failure. Omalu commented that 'cardiac arrest may be how he died, but not why'. More players died, but the NFL continued to silence and shun Omalu until 2009 when Cincinnati Bengals' wide receiver Chris Henry was diagnosed with CTE after his death at the age of 26. Omalu had moved to California with his wife and started a family. He was invited to speak at an NFL convention dealing with head injuries and offered a prominent position at Washington, D.C. Players began to sue the NFL for concealing Omalu's findings. The cases were settled with the condition that what the NFL knew and when would not be revealed. Movies like Concussion are tough. It's based on a true story, but without significant digging, it's hard to know how much of the movie is true and how much has been embellished or changed to make it more of a movie-going draw. The all-star cast would indicate that enough of Hollywood's big hitters felt this was a good enough story to tell. It's a story that has the NFL vigorously figuring out new equipment, new training methods, new treatment and new rules to help prevent CTE from continuing to take lives. I predicted 3.5 stars, thinking it would be a movie I'd enjoy, hopefully be able to discern between fact and fiction, and may or may not make it to my home collection. I thought Will Smith gave a wonderfully honest and subtle performance as Dr. Omalu. The movie is nearly two hours long, but I could have used a little more. There is a scene where Omalu proposes to his girlfriend at a plot of land he has already purchased for the both of them. Later, after being threatened by the FBI, they leave the home to move to California and he is completely broken up about it. I would like to have seen some more of their relationship develop and their investment into the house to support the heartbreak a little more. I felt the explanations of what was going on in the brains of the NFL players was very effectively addressed so that anyone would understand. I bumped up my star rating to 4.0 stars as this was well worth the money to watch it and has a decent chance of making it to my home collection.",8,1,4,2 April 2016
The Revenant," Sympathy Oscar for Just Okay Revenant
","Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a frontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s. It was a particularly dangerous and desperate time as the nearly 300 year old tradition of fur trading was in its waning years. Europeans came to America hoping for gold and silver in the early 1500s. They were disappointed, but found their riches in fur, particularly beavers. By the 1800s, beavers were scarce as they were over-hunted, and they weren't fetching the prices they used to and many turned to logging and working in lumber mills. This particular expedition proved especially treacherous for Glass as he was mauled by a bear and left for dead by his team. Glass made his way home, fueled by anger and his thirst for revenge against John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), the man who left him for dead. The Revenant was nominated for 12 Oscars and took home 3. Alejandro G. Iñárritu took home the Best Director award while the film also won for Best Cinematography. And, of course, DiCaprio finally got his Oscar for Best Actor that many felt was long overdue. It was his fifth nomination for acting as he was previously recognized for his performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, The Aviator, Blood Diamond, and The Wolf of Wallstreet.At first, John Fitzgerald is just a business man. He wants to stay the course and get as many pelts to take home to get as much money as they can. His decision to abandon Glass after the bear mauling was initially just a logical one taking into account Glass' chances of survival versus how much it would hinder their trek home trying to save him. That logic quickly turned vicious as Fitzgerald's greed and desperation turned murderous. I thought there were some great cinematic scenes, but most of them were shown in the brief preview. Of course the big scene is Glass being mauled by a bear which looked mostly realistic. As for the Oscar for Best Actor, I feel this was done out of the same sentiment that kept Tom Hanks from being nominated for Saving Mr. Banks or Captain Philips. Most speculated he was omitted because he's already won and he'll probably win again, so let someone else have a shot. This was the opposite. DiCaprio has been nominated and many feel he should have won already, so they gave it to him. I don't doubt he would have won an Oscar some day, but I don't think this should have been the one that got him there. Hardy was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and, had Mark Rylance not been nominated for his performance in Bridge of Spies (rightly nominated and won as I speculated immediately after seeing the movie), he surely would have won for his performance in The Revenant.I gave The Revenant a hesitant 3.5 star prediction. It dragged and didn't have much of a plot and the cinematography was played out in the preview. I give the movie 2.0 stars but bump it up to 2.5 because of Hardy's performance. It's a renter at best, but wait to catch it on cable and you'll be fine.",3,11,19,20 June 2016
Dallas Buyers Club," Dallas Buyers Club is a so-so movie with brilliant performances
","marksmoviemind.blogspot.comDallas Buyers Club is based on the true story of an electrician / rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) and his unlikely campaign to spread awareness and provide comfort and medicine for those who contracted AIDS. The story is set in Dallas in 1985 where Woodroof works hard and plays even harder, drinking, smoking, abusing illegal drugs and having casual sex. After seeing a doctor after a work-related injury, Woodroof is informed he has the AIDS virus and is given a month to live. At first, his ignorance and bravado prompt a defiant denial. Once he comes to terms and accepts the facts, he refuses to accept that there's nothing he can do. He does whatever he can to find treatments to at least prolong his life. In the process, he befriends and helps others who are afflicted with AIDS, others he would normally have nothing to do with. He dances dangerously between two worlds: the public world in which he provides assistance and medicine, and the private world trying to stay hidden from the FDA and authorities. Dallas Buyers Club has been nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Matthew McConaughey) and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Jared Leto). Leto has been nominated and won dozens of awards for his role as Rayon in Dallas Buyers Club. Rayon is a cross-dressing prostitute who starts as Woodroof's business partner and ends up his friend as Woodroof's greedy nature evolves into compassion. When hospitals refuse to give Woodroof any treatment for his AIDS because the medicine has not been approved by the FDA, his investigation leads him to Mexico. There, Woodroof concocts a scheme to make a lot of money by smuggling the experimental medication into the United States and distributing the drugs to those who need it. In an effort to evade the FDA, Woodroof starts the Dallas Buyers Club and sells memberships, not drugs. The drugs just come with the membership. At first, this is just a way for Woodroof to prolong his own life and make some money in the process. Somewhere along the way, he finds himself compelled to actually fight for the right of those with the AIDS virus to obtain treatment and to be treated not only for their illness, but also as human beings.The movie is exactly what the preview proclaims it to be: the story of Ron Woodroof dealing with contracting the AIDS virus, fighting with hospitals that are handcuffed by the FDA as far as what treatments they are allowed to administer, fighting with the FDA which is less concerned about actual treatment and more concerned about profit, and fighting with stereotypes about those who have contracted the virus. It's a sad story, it's upsetting, and it was brilliantly acted by McConaughey and Leto who definitely deserve the Oscar nominations they have received. But I don't feel the movie itself is worthy of the nomination for best picture of the year. I felt is was slow and boring at times in spite of the outstanding acting performances. I gave it 3.0 stars as I don't feel it was a waste of money, but I'm not excited to see it again and this won't be making it to my personal collection. I'd say it's a good renter or matinée in the theatres.",6,3,6,13 February 2014
Get Out," Get Out thrills and delights
","Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) have been dating for five months and it's time for Chris to meet the parents. He's a bit tentative about the weekend because he's black, she's white, and Rose hasn't told her parents. Chris' best friend Rod (LilRey Howery) advises him not to go to their secluded mansion in the woods, but Rose is able to convince him that it's going to be fine. Chris meets her parents Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener). Dean is a neurosurgeon and Missy is a psychologist skilled in the science of hypnotherapy. At first, they seem like an awkwardly cute, sweet couple trying too hard to be accommodating to their daughter's first black boyfriend, but things turn more than just awkward quickly.Chris meets Georgina (Betty Gabriel) the maid and Walter (Marcus Henderson) the groundskeeper. They are both black. Dean reassures Chris that despite how it looks (white family with black help), Georgina and Walter were brought on to help with his sick parents and they were invited to stay on after their passing, but there is something off about them. They are blank, vacant, almost like the Stepford wives. Their first night there, Chris steps outside for a cigarette and witnesses both Georgina and Walter behaving quite strangely in the middle of the night. He goes back inside to see Missy waiting for him. Rose and her parents are not thrilled with Chris' smoking and Missy has offered her services to hypnotize him to cure him of his addiction. Despite his opposition to the procedure, Missy is very good at what she does. Chris ends up in 'the sunken place' and awakes the next morning in bed, apparently rid of any desires to smoke.Over the weekend, that has turned into a large get together, Chris meets another black man who is a guest at the party. He introduces himself to Logan (Lakeith Stanfield). At first, Chris is relieved to see another black man at the party, someone who isn't employed at the estate, but his relief quickly fades as he finds out that Logan is just like Georgina and Walter: present, but not all there. Chris snaps a picture of Logan and the flash triggers something in him. He charges at Chris warning him to get out. Rod, who also works for the TSA, also warns him to get out when he finds out that black people have gone missing in that area.Chris and Rose go on a walk and eventually Rose agrees that it's an awful weekend. She is embarrassed by her family and friends and the experience Chris is having and agrees they should leave. While packing, Chris finds a hidden box of photos revealing he is not Rose's first black boyfriend. In fact, he recognizes her with Georgina and Walter in the pictures. That's when Chris realizes he was invited for the weekend, but he was never meant to leave.Get Out was written and directed by Jordan Peele of the comedy team Key and Peele. The preview looked completely creepy, a scary thriller with a bit of humor thrown in. I was concerned that it looked like it also might have quite a few of the clichéd 'gotcha' moments. Those are scenes where something is inherently unnerving or unsettling, mildly startling, but you are forced to react more severely because of a sharp music tone, a jarring sound effect, or a sudden camera movement. Personally, I don't care much for the forced jumps in scary movies. I'd rather just let the action or lack of action itself be what is scary on its own. Fortunately, there were only two of those 'gotcha' moments and they did exactly what they were meant to do by shocking the audience. We all immediately laughed at ourselves for falling victim to the ploy.Peele has written for MadTV and Key and Peele and also co-wrote the movie Keanu, a movie about a lost cat that didn't really live up to the hype. Get Out is Peele's second feature film he's written and his directorial debut. It's definitely quite a different genre than Keanu, but I went in to this one with low expectations and only gave it a 2.5 Star Prediction. To my delight, it was much better than I thought. It mixed elements of the creepiness of Deliverance, the Stepford Wives, and the Shining; the music of Jeepers Creepers, Nightmare on Elm Street 2 and Halloween 2; the humor of Django Unchained, Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland; and the triumph of 10 Cloverfield Lane, Alien, and 1408. I thought it was worth the money in the theatres and would recommend watching it with a crowd of at least 30 other people in the theatre who are there to be entertained and you can all experience this film together and out loud. You will laugh, squeal, cringe, gasp and cheer for Get Out. I'm bumping up my rating to 3.5 Stars as not only did I enjoy it in the theatres, I'm heavily inclined to watch it again and might even add this one to my home collection. marksmoviemind.blogspot.com",8,9,18,15 March 2017
Room," Room was touching, heart-warming, gripping, wow
","Room is the story about 5 year old Jack (Jacob Tremblay) and his mother Ma (Brie Larson) who are a typical loving mother and energetic son filled with curiosity and imagination in an anything but typical situation. They are both living, surviving, trapped in a 10 by 10 foot space that Ma has called Room in her best efforts to protect Jack from the absolutely unthinkable nightmare that is the only life he has ever known, a life she isn't sure will ever be anything else. However, miraculously, through Ma's ingenuity and guts and Jack's courage, one day, they escape. With their 10 x 10 Room behind them, they face a new world (literally) of hopes, possibilities, challenges and fears. I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch Room or Spotlight next with the Oscars upon us, but a good friend of mine, Steve Williams, strongly recommended Room. I'll be watching Spotlight next, but thank you to Steve for the recommendation. It was powerful. Larson has had supporting roles in Trainwreck, The Gambler and Don Jon along with multiple TV appearances, but this is her first leading role and she also looks right at home. In fact, her performance has not only earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, but many critics are predicting she will go home with the win and after watching the movie, it would be an award well-deserved. Room opens on Jack's 5th birthday. We find out later that Ma was abducted 7 years earlier and Jack was born and raised in Room. Her abductor makes regular visits (conjugal in nature) with Jack tucked away in Wardrobe. We already know from the preview that they do eventually escape and are given a chance to have a life outside Room, so that's not a spoiler there. I won't give it all away, but the escape will leave you breathless with white knuckles as you cling to whatever you have nearby. I really only had two minor issues with the movie. First, after she is reunited with her parents, Ma is unsettled to discover they had split and her mother (Joan Allen) had met a new man. Her father (William H. Macy) flies home to be there for the reunion, but quickly leaves and can't even look at Jack or address him. And then we don't see him again and are left wondering what happened. The second minor issue I had was that the preview uses part of its limited time to share a scene after their escape between Jack and Ma in which Jack is concerned about their abductor finding them again. Ma reassures him that it will never happen. And it doesn't come up again at all. It's handled just fine in the movie, but the issue is that the preview seemed to indicate it would be a factor in the aftermath. It wasn't. The aftermath of adjusting to the real world was dramatic enough as it was and didn't need to be in the preview.Room is a touching, heart-warming, intense, gripping, original and well-acted and well-told story that I thoroughly enjoyed. I predicted a solid 4 stars: worth the money in the theatre, worth watching again, and has a good chance of making it to my home collection, and that's exactly what I'm sticking with.marksmoviemind.blogspot.com",8,0,5,28 February 2016
Hidden Figures," Hidden Figures is a great story about 3 women at NASA but falls short of the gravity of 1961
","In the early 1960's, America was in the middle of two heated battles. At home, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led the civil movement for racial equality in a time when African Americans were forced to ride separate buses, drink from separate water fountains and just generally were considered less human. In addition to that, women were fighting for their own equal rights. On a global scale, NASA fought to keep ahead of the Soviets in the race to explore space. Hidden Figures is the story of three African American women who fought both battles.Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) work for NASA and are part of a group of mathematical geniuses referred to as human computers since mechanical computers weren't invented yet to perform such difficult calculations. The Russians launched the first ever satellite into space followed by the first man to orbit the earth and Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) is pressured to surpass the Soviet efforts. They don't want to be outdone in the space race, they need to justify a space program that has yet to send a man to space, and they fear the Russians' access to space will allow them to spy on the United States. Desperate to succeed, Katherine is sent to the think tank of all white male human computers. She struggles to fit in and be accepted and respected, but she is determined, eventually winning them over. On the day of the launch of John Glenn aboard the Mercury Friendship 7, the IBM super computer calculations do not match the ones the human computers had figured out and Katherine is called in to confirm the correct numbers. The information must be relayed to Glenn, but her findings are given to Al and she is shut out. Al opens the door and invites her to come witness the achievement she helped to orchestrate. Katherine was also instrumental in the Apollo 11 flight to the moon in 1969. It wasn't until 2015 that she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and until 2016 that NASA renamed the Langley Research Center in Virginia the Katherine G. Johnson Computational Research Facility. Hidden Figures is an amazing story that took entirely too long to come to light. The biggest thing the trio of African American human computer women had going for them in 1961 was that America hated the Soviets just a bit more than they held to their racism and sexism. If Katherine could find a way to beat the Russians, their biases against her skin color and gender were overlooked to defeat the enemy. The preview showed what could be an Oscar nomination worthy performance from Taraji P. Henson in the biggest role of her long career. She has mostly done television work and voice overs with some supporting character roles along the way. Most recently, she has starred in the TV series Empire after she left the hit drama Person of Interest. She was quite comfortable in her role as the leading lady playing the timid and demure mother of 3 trying not to rock the boat at work but also the strong woman who knew when and how to speak up when necessary. Surprisingly, Henson was not nominated for her role, but Octavia Spencer was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and honestly, I feel they got those reversed. While the racial tensions were heated in the United States, the preview showed clips that glossed over the severity of the fight for equality with walls of segregation falling around them both in and out of NASA. There was a lot of humor in the preview and my only concern was how the 2 hour and 7 minute movie would deal with the graphic nature of our countries ugly history at this time. I'm gave Hidden Figures a 3.5 Star Prediction. I am sticking with that 3.5 Star rating. I thought it was missing something and I can't quite put my finger on it. I didn't want the racial issues to be jammed down my throat, but I felt the true weight of the tension of the time wasn't adequately portrayed. We saw clips of segregated buses and schools, white and colored drinking fountains, a special colored only coffee pot for Katherine, but it still didn't quite feel as uncomfortable to a viewer as it should have. I know the main point of the movie was about their accomplishments at NASA during this particular time, but I still think they could have addressed the racial and sexist issues in such a way that it really upset an audience member, thus further emphasizing just how incredible their accomplishments were. Still, I thought it was worth the money to see it in the theatres, I'll probably watch it again, but probably won't be owning this one. marksmoviemind.blogspot.com",7,4,11,27 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Jedi doesn't disappoint with some disappointments included
","Star Wars VIII: The Last Jedi is the second installment in the third trilogy of nine mainstream Star Wars movies that started back in 1977 with Episode IV: A New Hope. Back then, there was no such thing as CGI or 3D. So filmmaker George Lucas invented technology to make his vision come to life. His films were groundbreaking and laid the foundation for some of the greatest advances in cinema. Episodes IV, V, and VI were movies that changed how movies are made. They were ahead of their time and still hold up forty years later. In 1999, Lucas went back to tell us how it all began with Episode I: The Phantom Menace. CGI technology had come a long way, but it wasn't perfect. For his original trilogy, Lucas invented new technology to create what he saw in his mind. He received heavy criticism for Episode I as he seemed instead to settle for what technology was available at the time. He listened to the critics and scaled it back for Episode III, but it still lacked what made the original trilogy so special. In 2015, JJ Abrams and Disney joined forces (pun intended) to release Episode VII: The Force Awakens and it was the perfect blend of technology versus actual characters and actual props. Episode VIII continues Rey's (Daisy Ridley) Jedi training with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).
In my preview post, I spent much of the post drawing parallels between the 7 existing Star Wars movies. There are so many similarities between the plots, the twists, the characters, the scenes. I'll skip most of that, but restate my comparisons between Episode II and Episode V since Episode VIII is the second in the trilogy as well.In Episode II, Anakin's training is progressing rapidly. It is revealed that Senator Palpatin is really the dark Sith Lord they've been looking for and he begins to tempt Anakin with the power of the dark side. During a battle with Count Dooku, Anakin loses his hand. The movie ends with Anakin's arm and prosthetic hand around Padme (Natalie Portman) with C3PO and R2-D2 at their side. In Episode V, Luke's training is progressing rapidly. It is revealed the Darth Vader is actually Luke's father as he begins to try to seduce Luke to the dark side. During a battle with Vader, Luke loses his hand. The movie ends with Luke's arm and prosthetic hand around Leah (Carrie Fisher) with C3PO and R2-D2 at their side. Both movies begin to take a darker turn from their lighter predecessor preparing us for the darkest third installment of Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith. Ironically, the original working title for Episode VI was Revenge of the Jedi, but Lucas changed it to Return because a Jedi does not seek revenge. That is a characteristic of the dark side, hence Revenge of the Sith.
So, if history repeated itself a third time, there should have been some similarities in the newly released Star Wars VIII: The Last Jedi. Rey's training should progress rapidly, and it does. There should be a surprising reveal, but there really wasn't. The previews lead us to believe there could be some darkness in Luke, but there isn't. It's more of his whiny self blaming himself for the fall of the Jedi and hoping his own isolation and death would bring an end to the Jedi. It could also have been in the revealing of who the holographic dark lord Snoke really is. Well, we do get to see Snoke up close and personal, but we still don't know who he really is or where he came from. Kylo Ren will grow more powerful as he is increasingly agitated with the struggle inside himself. That is definitely true. It will be darker than Episode VII: The Force Awakens, but not nearly as dark as Episode IX will be in two more years. It was certainly darker than its predecessor, but only time will tell what Episode IX has in store for us.
So this movie did not exactly follow the previous trilogy formulas of similarity. In fact, The Last Jedi's epic 2 hour and 44 minute adventure had elements of both second and third installments. Rey advances her training with Luke and faces her own demons. No one loses their hand in this movie like Anakin did in Attack of the Clones or like Luke did in Empire Strikes Back. And there really was no dramatic reveal. Yes, we find out who Rey's parents are, but after years of build-up and anticipation, the reveal from Kylo Ren is anti-climactic at best, if what he said is true. And we are given no reason to doubt the veracity of his claim. But that still doesn't explain Rey's connection with Luke and the force. We are also introduced to a new Han Solo type character. While Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) are imprisoned looking for the master hacker, fellow inmate DJ (Benicio Del Toro) helps them escape and vows to assist them in their mission for the right price. He later turns on them for his own freedom and a handsome payoff. He's a much more suitable Han character than Jar Jar Binks was apparently supposed to represent.
But The Last Jedi also had many elements of Episodes III and VI. Kylo Ren takes Rey to Supreme Leader Snoke in cuffs, each hoping to turn the other to their side of the force. Snoke sits confidently in his chair taunting Rey with her lightsaber at his side while the fleeing Rebel forces are under attack from the Galactic Empire. 
I did take issue with a few things in the movie. I didn't care for all the 'connection' scenes between Rey and Kylo Ren. Luke had a similar connection with Darth Vader, but this took it to almost an annoying level. I didn't care for Leah's 'powers' that came out of nowhere. We were given a glimpse of her abilities in Empire Strikes Back when she feels Luke's whereabouts in Cloud City, and Yoda promises there is another hope for the Jedi referring to Leah and Luke says the force is in her, but we see none of it in Return of the Jedi or The Force Awakens. Also, actress Carrie Fisher sadly passed away before the film's release, but her character completed The Last Jedi which means it will have to be addressed in Episode IX. And I didn't care for Luke's trick against Kylo Ren. 
JJ Abrams did not direct The Last Jedi, but handed over the reigns to a fairly new director Rian Johnson who's most notable works are a few episodes of Breaking Bad and the Sci-Fi movie Looper. But, from the previews, Johnson looked like he was more than up for the challenge. Unfortunately, I did feel that a bit of the JJ balance of CGI to real-life was sacrificed in this second installment. It was still leagues ahead of Episodes I-III, but not as flawless as Episode VII. Supreme Leader Snoke was animated with the same facial recognition technology as Lord of the Rings, Planet of the Apes and Avatar. It was good. But his disfigured face and mastery of the dark side were supposed to be menacing. I honestly found the Emperor from Episodes V and VI to be more scary and that was done purely through makeup. It looked like his animation wasn't limited to his face and hands, but included his clothes. For some reason, we can do hair, water, explosions really well, but clothes still elude animators when striving for undetectable perfection.
I gave Episode VII a rare perfect 5 Star rating so I expected the same perfection giving a 5 Star follow-up prediction for Episode VIII: The Last Jedi. I thought most of the animation was fantastic. It was a great story and thoroughly entertaining. I'm glad I saw it in the theatre and it was worth the money. I know I'll be owning it, but I am dropping my rating to 4 Stars.",8,0,2,16 December 2017
La La Land," La La Land was absolutely delightful
","As big and daunting as Los Angeles is, it's also a relatively small town, especially if you're trying to get into show business. Mia (Emma Stone) is one of those many hopefuls. She's working at a coffee shop on the Warner Brothers studio lot, giving the actors who are doing what she longs to do their caffeine fix. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is another hopeful, also currently scraping the bottom of the barrel. To keep the roof over his head in his dumpy apartment and to pay what bills he can, which isn't many, he plays jazz at any club that will have him. Mia and Sebastian first meet in the notorious LA traffic. She is holding up traffic going over lines for an audition, he is stuck behind her. He passes her with a glare, she responds with another unfriendly, but definitely Los Angelan gesture. Their paths cross again later that evening after a party that Mia's roommates encourage her to attend after a bad audition. She leaves on her own, walking home after her car was towed and hears Sebastian playing at a club she passes. She walks in just in time to see him get fired for not sticking to the Christmas set list. She tries to compliment him, but he brushes right by her. Months later at an 80s party, Mia gets some revenge as Sebastian is performing with an 80s tribute band. They end up leaving together in search of their cars and start a wonderful song and dance duet a la Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.After a number of close calls and missed opportunities in La La Land both professionally and personally, Sebastian encourages Mia to write her own show. She agrees, though terrified of failure, and writes a one-woman show she will also perform. All Sebastian wants is to own his own jazz club, but he doesn't have the money, so he reluctantly takes a gig with a fellow musician. The group is very successful, but it's not the type of jazz Sebastian wants to play and it's keeping him apart from Mia. With glimpses of romance with each other and opportunities for success in the dog-eat-dog world of entertainment, the two must make some tough decisions about what they really want out of life. Ultimately, they both decide what is most important to each of them and they live happily ever after . . . though, not quite how you might assume.La La Land was written and directed by Damien Chazelle who recently shot into the spotlight with his critically acclaimed writing and directing achievement with Whiplash. While both deal with music, La La Land is completely different than his dark and torturous Whiplash. If Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Judy Garland, or Fred Astaire were still making musicals today, La La Land would be their product. They don't make movies like this anymore, but hopefully the will after this. We've seen episodes of How I Met Your Mother, Psych, Scrubs, Family Guy and even South Park pay homage to the art of yesterdecade. We've also seen musicals revitalized with Mama Mia!, Moulin Rouge, Rock of Ages, and Jersey Boys. But a musical set today with the feel of the 50's is long overdue and it's been worth the wait as La La Land combines traditional old school movie sets mixed with some of the modern movie special effects that they couldn't even imagine in Singin' in the Rain or Grease.Gosling and Stone lit up the screen in the preview, coming across as the perfect kids you're rooting for, both in their pursuits of their passions and in their blooming romance. They delivered as did La La Land. If you like any of the movies I've named, just watching the preview probably made you smile with anticipation. It just cleaned up at the Golden Globes with wins for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Musical or Comedy, Best Director, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. I gave La La Land a very hopeful 4 Star prediction but I'm boosting it up to 4.5 Stars. It was nearly perfect. Gosling and Stone are a perfect match in their wit, comedic timing, sincerity, romance, singing and dancing. If this is the first of many more modern day musicals to come, then we are in for a real treat. If this doesn't spark more of its kind, it would be a shame, but we were blessed with this rare gem and I'll be adding it to my collection for sure.marksmoviemind.blogspot.com",9,3,10,12 January 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Beauty and the Beast comes to life
","Disney has done it again. We all know the story. It's a 'tale as old as time'. We all know the formula by now. Disney is taking their classic movies and re-making, re-imagining, recreating them (whatever you want to call it) as live-action movies. In 2010, Tim Burton and Disney brought the live-action version of Alice in Wonderland with Johnny Depp to the big screen. Maleficent followed in 2014 starring Angelina Jolie re-telling the story of Sleeping Beauty. Next was Cinderella in 2015 and 2016 gave us Pete's Dragon and The Jungle Book. Now, Emma Watson reprises the role of Belle in Beauty and the Beast. Disney's original groundbreaking animated masterpiece was released in November 1991. It was nominated for Best Picture of the Year, the first of only 3 animated movies to ever be nominated for Best Picture.The preview for Beauty and the Beast looked breathtakingly beautiful. There is so much to show in so little time, so they don't really waste any of it trying to summarize the plot like they do in most previews, assuming you already know the story. Instead, you are given little gems. A glimpse of the Beast that looks like Disney's original animation come to life. Brief shots of our favorite characters: Chip, Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson), Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) and Lumiere (Ewan McGregor). Emma Watson as Belle, who may not be the obvious choice, but looked in the preview to pull off the role quite well, and she does a fantastic job. The CGI that looked like it would hold its own against Disney's latest reinvention of The Jungle Book that just won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. And some of the familiar music that made the first so special.I had extremely high expectations for Beauty and the Beast, but there were a few things that I felt would have to be nailed for this to be perfect. Belle. As I just said, Watson doesn't immediately stand out as the obvious choice for the role. She looked great in the preview, but I wondered if she could hold it with the intelligence, grace, bravery, strength and singing required to match her predecessor's performance. She did. In fact, after seeing her performance and hearing her voice mastering so many iconic songs, I don't know that I could imagine anyone else in the role.I also felt that the animation needed to be flawless. This film had two previous movies to live up to: the original animated version from 1991 that was nominated for Best Picture and the 2016 Jungle Book. Many of the critiques I've read about Beauty and the Beast criticized the CGI, specifically the Beast. They say his eyes are off and the characters are flat. I disagree and wonder if they didn't understand the difference in story-telling between Jungle Book and Beauty and the Beast. Jungle Book was supposed to be much more realistic, aside from talking animals. It wasn't a fantasy world, it wasn't a dream, it was a man-child in the jungle with real animals. Beauty and the Beast is fantasy, a place of Belle's dreams and others' nightmares. A Prince turned into a hideous beast. Servants turned into a candlestick, a clock, a dresser, a teapot and cup. Of course the animation is going to look different. Now, that being said, there were a couple moments with Beast walking that were slightly less perfect than his animation for the rest of the movie. However, the human characters' interactions with the animated ones were seamless.The music. Jungle Book didn't hold back with their musical numbers and I hoped that Beast wouldn't either. They didn't. In fact, we were introduced to a few new songs written just for this live-action version of the classic. We get to see the history of the Prince and why he became such a selfish man. We also got to see what happened to Belle's mother and what drove her father from Paris when she was just a baby. Though they didn't have the same catchy lyrics that will have kids and adults singing for 16 years to come, they fit right in with the story and were welcomed additions to the film.And finally, the ballroom scene. The sweeping shot of the chandelier in the grand ballroom with Belle in her yellow dress and Beast in his blue suit was nothing short of iconic and groundbreaking in the original animation. It's a lot to live up to. They went a slightly different route with the ballroom scene. Instead of one central chandelier, they had several in the room and the sweeping shot around the room revealed instruments on the wall helping to orchestrate their dance. My only criticism of that scene was that the original shone so bright and golden and this version, although beautiful, was a little muted.Beauty and the Beast had a lot to live up to, and the preview made it look like they were up to the task. So I gave it a very enthusiastic and hopeful 4.5 Star Prediction. After watching the movie, I believe they were very successful in paying tribute to the original while making decisions to set their live action version apart and modern-ish for 2017. I enjoyed it completely and thought it nearly perfect except for my few minor criticisms. So I'm sticking with my 4.5 Star rating. marksmoviemind.blogspot.com",9,7,19,17 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," The Guardians are Still Fun and Still Rocking
","Three years ago, the earthling Peter Quill A.K.A. Star Lord (Chris Pratt) acquired a mysterious orb that put his life in danger. Hunted by the villain Ronan the Accuser, Quill assembled a team of intergalactic misfits who teamed up to stop Ronan and save the galaxy in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. Quill was accompanied by Gamora (Zoe Saldana) a green orphan from an alien world raised to be an assassin; a physical brute named Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista); Groot (Vin Diesel) who is basically a giant walking tree with limited communication skills; and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) a raccoon bounty hunter / mercenary.Groot is back and adorable. Though the giant tree perished in Volume 1, Rocket replanted a piece of his friend that has produced the offspring, Baby Groot for Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2. The unspoken sexual tension (ala Sam and Diane from Cheers) between Quill and Gamora is palpable, but endearing and sweet. And, as expected, another epic soundtrack accompanied this movie, including the ending credits from David Hasselhoff. As a child, not knowing who his father was, Quill would tell other children that the Knight Rider was his dad. But Volume 2 answers that question for us.We don't learn too much from the preview. We can tell the action and animation is at least on par with Volume 1. It was. We saw that the humorous one-liners would be flowing plentifully. They were. We know all our favorite characters are back and some new ones will be introduced. But, we don't get too much of a plot reveal from the preview. Well, if you don't want any spoilers, here where you stop reading. Volume 2 opens with Ego (Kurt Russell) and Meredith (Laura Haddock) driving in 1983 with the radio blasting and Meredith singing, truly where Peter got his passion for music. The two young lovebirds run into the woods where Ego shows her a beautiful exotic blue plant. As he vaguely describes what it is, she says she doesn't understand what he's saying but loves the way he says it. She can't believe she fell for a space man.Thirty-four years later, Star-Lord and his fellow Guardians have been hired to fight off an intergalactic monster trying to steal a valuable source of power. It's a cute seen that is pretty much Baby Groot dancing while the Guardians take down the beast. They return to collect their prize for a successful mission: Gamora's sister Nebula (Karen Gillan). They don't get along and Gamora is going to turn her in for the bounty on her. They don't make it that far as their ship is attacked by the very same creatures that employed them because Rocket, couldn't resist stealing some of the valuable cargo they were tasked to protect. They set their course for the nearest safe planet, but they were outnumbered and it looked like all hope was lost until one solo ship appeared and the pursuing armada was completely decimated in an instant. After crashing on the planet, their savior ship appears and Ego emerges, immediately revealing himself as Peter's father. Ego, with his companion Mantis (Pom Klementieff) convince Peter, Gamora and Drax to return to his planet for further explanation while Rocket, Baby Groot and Nebula stay behind with the damaged ship.That's where the big reveal happens. Ego is not a human. He is a god. The planet is his and he is the only inhabitant, other than the alien orphan he has with him, Mantis. He has fathered many children throughout the galaxy, but Peter is the only one who carried his god-gene that Ego needs to take over the universe. The epic battle ensues on many levels, but culminates on Ego's planet as the Guardians again must save the Galaxy. I won't tell you how it all ends, I think I've revealed enough plot-spoilers at this point.Most of the star prediction was based on Volume 1 since the preview didn't reveal much about Volume 2. But it was a successful preview for two reasons. First, there was just too much to reveal. I just scratched the surface of all the plot twists and reveals that are jam-packed into this sequel. In addition to that, there are more characters and special appearances in the film. But, if the preview clued you in to their roles, it wouldn't have been as fun when they popped up on screen. So kudos for keeping those nuggets to themselves. Second, it gave you enough to make you want to come see it. Basically, the preview said, if you liked the first one, everything you loved about it will be in the second one. And it was all there. It was fun, original, enjoyable and more than just a sequel. I gave Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 a 3.5 star prediction: worth the money in the theatres, something I'd watch again, and a contender for my home collection. I was right on and I'm sticking with my 3.5 Stars. Fans of the comic, fans of sci-fi action movies, fans of Marvel, fans of the first movie, they will all be quite pleased with Volume 2. So, what movie",7,3,9,1 May 2017
The Wolf of Wall Street," Disturbingly Graphic Look into the Evil World of Wall Street
","The preview for The Wolf of Wall Street just barely gives you a glimpse into the seedy world of finance that is a breeding ground for complete and utter debauchery and total lack of self-control or inhibition. On Belfort's first day on Wall Street, he is taken to lunch by senior partner Mark Hannah (Matthew McConaughey) who snorts cocaine, drinks martinis and talks about sexual gratification openly with Belfort. Belfort innocently declines the drugs and booze and naively suggests that making money for their clients in the process of making money for themselves would be a good thing. Hannah quickly shuts down that idea and says it's only about making themselves rich. Within months, Belfort is in a strip club, doing enough daily drugs to sedate Manhattan, and drinking excessively. He is making so much money that he snorts a line of cocaine off his desk at work with a hundred dollar bill, crumples the bill and tosses it in a waste basket full of them. He comments that he made forty-nine million dollars last year and that upset him because he was three million shy of a million a week. He is constantly with different women, cheating on both of his wives. He is constantly cheating investors out of their money and training his staff to do the same. This film is graphic and disturbing. I laugh briefly but am quickly nauseated to remember that this actually happened, and probably still happens in the world of finance among those who care for nothing than to have more money than they know what to do with. I don't care to watch it again and it will not be making it into my personal collection. That's exactly what the movie aimed to do. It isn't glorifying this behavior. It's bringing it into the spotlight. It shows how dark and ugly riches can make people. And co-star Johah Hill understood that fully when he took on the role of Belfort's co-founder and best friend Donnie Azoff. 'It was understood going in that there was no holding back. Every day we were doing something crazy, and it's fun and exciting working for Scorsese, and then when I'd be driving home at the end of the day, I'd feel a wave of guilt come over me because I treated people so badly that day.' And Hill was just playing a role. Playing a character. Except these aren't just fictional characters in someone's mind like a psychopath in the mind of Stephen King. These people actually exist and they actually don't have those moments of guilt or remorse for the things they've done or to whom they were done. While the FBI was investigating Belfort and his company, none of his co-workers ratted on anyone, giving the FBI no information at all that could help with their investigation. They presented Belfort with enough evidence that suggested he could go to prison for 20 years to life if he refused to cooperate. In exchange, he would only serve 4 years. He agrees to wear a wire, but slides a note to Azoff alerting him to the fact they were being recorded. The FBI recovers the note and arrests Belfort with no more deals. However, once he tells them everything he knows, his sentence is reduced to a mere 3 years in a facility where he is seen playing tennis daily. Belfort went on to write a best-selling novel about his experience about which this movie was written, he had a guest appearance in the movie, and is currently giving salesmanship seminars. It's disturbing that our financial and our justice system allow and encourage this type of behavior while the hardest working people can barely get by. Matthew McConaughey, Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio give amazing performances and effectively portray the slimiest dirt bags you could possibly imagine. To me, however, it's just sad that even in bringing about such evil to light, the performances and film themselves are rewarded with nominations for the best of the year. Maybe I'm just getting too old and maybe I'm just a prude, but this seems a bit like showing criminals on the news. Yes, it gets ratings, but it also gets them what they want: their moment of fame. In fact, the story of criminality continues for the real Jordan Belfort. He was paid $1.045 million dollars for the rights to his book. According to the government, only $21,000 of that went to repay his victims. In 2003, he was ordered to repay $110.4 million dollars to his victims. He has only paid back $11.6 million. Though it doesn't glorify the behaviors, The Wolf of Wall Street does still show that you can cheat people and make yourself filthy rich, if you don't mind the filthy part. And, even if you get caught, if you have enough money to start with, you'll still end up much better off than most people.",7,1,2,1 February 2014
Arrival," Arrival Delights and Confuses
","The answer to 'Are we alone in the galaxy' has been answered in Arrival as a dozen mysterious spacecraft land in various locations across the earth. The government brings in linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and physicist Ian Donnely (Jeremy Renner) to attempt to communicate with whatever might be inside. She and her team must find a way to discover the truth of their intentions as the world prepares for the possibility of global war.The preview showed two different sides completely sure that their interpretation of the situation is correct. The government and military are convinced that the aliens are here with the intent to destroy while Banks believes they are not our enemy. Making contact with the aliens inside the pods is not a difficult task as they have made themselves available to the human race through an opening in the pod. Once inside, they are separated by a protective barrier, presumably due to atmospheric restraints, but they are able to see and hear each other. The humans rely on pen and paper while the aliens have a sort of squid ink technology coming from one of their appendages that form shapes. Banks is able to interpret the shapes and starts the slow process of communication that will hopefully reveal their intent. She is told they are out of time and that action must be taken. So she does, but it isn't what the military had planned. Those promoting the film promise a surprise ending that will have viewers talking for quite a while after the movie is over.There have been plenty of alien movies throughout the years. While some portray them in a peaceful light (E.T. the Extraterrestrial, StarMan, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Cocoon), others show a very violent side to the visitors (Independence Day, Cowboys & Aliens, The War of the Worlds). Regardless of their intent, it is always a terrifyingly unknown situation and the residents of planet Earth are immediately frightened at the catastrophic possibility rather than optimistic. While Arrival isn't of the variety of blockbuster explosions that made some of the alien movies into hits, it does deliver a gripping and fascinating drama. I'm a huge fan of Amy Adams. She is joined by Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker in what I anticipated to be a very well executed alien film on all fronts: special effects, acting, drama, original story, and intensity leaving you breathless at the end. Well, it didn't exactly leave you breathless . . . more like confused, especially if you haven't read the story on which the movie is based. I gave Arrival a very hopeful and optimistic 4 Star prediction, but I've knocked that down slightly to 3.5 stars. Much of the movie had confusing flashbacks that led to revelations of communication with the aliens. But those confusions only made me more excited to see the big wow ending we were all promised. At the end, I was even more confused as it was no longer clear if the visions Banks had were memories or premonitions. And instead of saying, 'Woah, did that just happen?!' I sat there saying, 'Wait, what just happened?!' I definitely need to watch this again, but I thought Adams and Renner gave wonderful performances, the special effects were perfect, it was original, but I think it missed the ball on driving the whole point home at the end with clarity. Some I've talked to have commented that the book is much more clear and would help make more sense of the movie. I'll be watching this at least one more time; and, who knows, the second time around might tip the scales to me wanting to own Arrival in my personal collection. www.marksmoviemind.blogspot.com",7,0,5,28 November 2016
The Big Short," A Different Look at the Housing Crisis of 2008
","Based on the same housing economic meltdown in 2008, The Big Short covers the story from the different viewpoint of a few who saw it coming. Michael Burry (Christian Bale), was a physician and hedge fund manager, creator of Scion Capital LLC. He was the first to recognize the impending doom of the careless practices by financial institutions and bet heavy on the housing market bubble to burst in a big way. He was so confident in his analysis that he used $1 Billion of his investors money. Some of his investors were more than displeased and pulled out in 2006 and 2007. When the market crashed in 2008, Burry profited $100 million for himself and another $700 for his remaining investors. He was quoted as saying, 'I don't go out looking for good shorts. I'm spending my time looking for good longs.'Banker Jared Vennett (Ryan Gossling) and another hedge fund manager Mark Baum (Steve Carell) caught wind of what Burry was up to and jumped in as well. Some young investors accidentally discovered what Vennett was up to and talked Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), an ex stocks trader, into taking part. The Big Short was nominated for Best Picture of the Year and Bale was nominated for his supporting role. It won for Best Adapted Screenplay. The preview looks to be a stinging look at the corporate greed that rocked the world with a bit of humor as a small group forms a bit of a financial coup. However, the humor is either going to be one of those 'it's funnier because it's true' situations, or it will illicit a sort of 'ha-ha-ouch' at just how crippling their ignorance and greed was, and still remains today.I anticipated rating this 3.5 stars. Throughout the movie, I dropped down to 2.5, but raised it up to a final verdict of 3.0 stars. It's entertaining, well-acted, but sometimes hard to follow. What helped me raise it up was that the movie self-admits that it's own subject matter is boring and confusing. It takes breaks from the film in unique ways to help those of us not in the know what exactly is going on. I was still confused at parts during the film, but those moments of 'banking for dummies' definitely helped. These breaks are done through an artistic method called 'breaking the fourth wall'. In theatre and in film, when you as an audience member are looking at a scene with 3 walls in a room, the fourth wall is assumed to be where the camera is positioned. You take it for granted that there is a fourth wall and don't think about the cameras and cables and directors and monitors, etc that are actually there. When an actor on stage acknowledges the audience by speaking directly to them, or in a movie when you are addressed by the actor breaking away from the movie, they are ultimately admitting that there is no fourth wall, that this is just a play or a movie and that there are people watching in one way or another. Gossling's character helps to drive the story much like a narrator in a Shakespearean play who introduces the plot with a prologue, has a couple recapping monologues and then sums it up with a prologue. Unfortunately for The Big Short, if you watched any television at all or were on the internet or picked up a paper in late 2008, most of the things covered in the movie, we already knew. The banks started making more money off of mortgages by clumping them into bundles. They were secure with the best ratings meaning that there was almost no chance the mortgages wouldn't be paid back. The banks made a ton of money. Eventually, housing for the qualified homeowners started to dry up and the bonuses started to shrink. That's when they started lumping in some riskier mortgages in to the bundle. No one did background checks and the mortgages written were only for a short introductory period that would then balloon into 200 to 300 per cent of the original payback rate. When the introductory period ended and millions found they couldn't afford their payments, millions lost their homes and even more lost their jobs and the banks covered it all up. When the truth was finally discovered, it was too late and the US Government saw no other way to limit and reverse the damages than to shell out billions in taxpayer money to the banks. This money was used to then pay out big bonuses and only one person ever went to jail. And the banks are still doing it today, just with different names. The Big Short was very well-acted, entertaining, confusing, upsetting, but seeing it once was enough for me. I might catch it on TV someday, but it won't be making it to my home collected, hence the 3.0 star rating.",4,0,1,31 March 2016
The Greatest Showman," Entertaining Movie, Oscar Worthy Music
","'Unless a man enters upon the vocation intended for him by nature, and best suited to his peculiar genius, he cannot succeed.' Phineas Taylor Barnum, best known today as simply P.T. Barnum, was born in 1810 in Bethel, Connecticut. In his early 20s, Barnum was a small business owner and founder of a weekly newspaper. He moved to New York in 1934 where his entertainment career began when he purchased Scudder's American Museum that he renamed after himself and transformed into a 'freak show' playing on human curiosity with features like the Feejee mermaid and General Tom Thumb. Later in life, Barnum returned to Connecticut where he served as Mayor in 1875. He was an author, publisher, politician, businessman, and philanthropist, but is best remembered for his showmanship. It is that achievement that has inspired the new musical The Greatest Showman starring Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum.If you have read any of my previous Previews or Reviews for films based on actual events or people, I have given up on doing too much research beforehand as the movies often take many creative liberties with regards to the timeline of events, the location of events, characters involved, roles they played, and more. And they have every right to do so as the films make no claims to be historically accurate or documentaries. The Greatest Showman is based on the life of P.T. Barnum, specifically in regards to his creation of the Barnum & Bailey Circus dubbed The Greatest Show on Earth.Hugh Jackman tackles the title role of Barnum and he is no stranger to singing on stage or in film. Jackman grew up a theatre performer in Australia including musicals. The world was exposed to his singing abilities in 2012 with his role as Jean Valjean in Les Miserables, a performance that earned him the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor. Jackman received both praise and criticism for his vocal performance. I was one of the critics asking the question 'Were you impressed with the performances in Les Miserables because you wouldn't expect Wolverine and Gladiator to be able to sing like that, or did you really think they gave the performances you would expect if you had paid $500 to watch this on Broadway?' Jackman has already been nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance in The Greatest Showman and I enjoyed his singing as Barnum more than I liked his Jean Valjean in Les Miserables.Zac Efron's leading man roles in his career to date have been campy, goofy and sophomoric starring in such movies as Neighbors 1 and 2, Dirty Grandpa, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, and Baywatch. He is slated to play a completely opposite role as Ted Bundy in a film titled Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile that could really reshape his career and propel him to a much higher platform possibly opening many more 'meaty' roles for the young actor. His performance in The Greatest Showman was definitely a huge step in the right direction to separate him as more than just the goofball in crude comedies.Last year, when La La Land came out, I said we were long overdue for a new musical and La La Land was hopefully the first of many. Songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul took home the Oscar for Original Song with their creation of 'City of Stars' from La La Land. They're back and have written the original music for The Greatest Showman and I would be surprised if they didn't get at least one more Oscar nomination this year as it was the music that really stole the show. The Greatest Showman features a modern pop feel as team Pasek and Paul did not confine themselves to the 1830's when the film is set. It was a risk, but a risk that paid off. If they tried to fit the songs to the era of the film, I don't think this movie would have worked at all.I was excited for The Greatest Showman and had high expectations. I gave a 4.5 Star Prediction as I anticipated thoroughly enjoying Jackman and Efron's performances along with co-stars Michelle Williams and Zendaya, the music, and the spectacle from director Michael Gracey who literally made his big screen debut. He's so green, he doesn't even have a completed biography on IMDB. I had a feeling this would just the beginning for Gracey after a hugely successful Greatest Showman. I thought this movie was sweet, charming, electric, exciting, fun, and sensitive. However, I felt it should have been about 20 minutes longer than its 1 hour and 44 minute running time. Barnum didn't come from anything at all and swept his wife away from a lavish, wealthy lifestyle. She didn't care about the money. Their apartment had a leaky roof and no frills at all, but she and their two daughters were happy. After losing another job, Barnum took a risk and convinced a bank to loan him $10,000 so he could purchase a macabre wax museum figuring that human's morbid curiosity would draw them in. His daughters pointed out that it wasn't enough. He needed live spectacles. He agreed and searched for the outcasts, the freaks. He found his Tom Thumb, a bearded lady, the World's Fattest Man, the Irish Giant, the acrobat brother and sister, and many more. And it worked. People lined up and shows were sold out to see something no one had ever seen before.Barnum teamed up with the legitimate theatre producer Phillip Carlyle (Efron) to raise their show to the next level. It takes some convincing but Carlyle gets on board and it isn't long before their entire troop gets an audience with the British Queen. It's there that I feel the movie started rushing things. Providing a better life, a bigger home, ballet lessons, fancy clothes soon wasn't enough for Barnum. He became obsessed with people's opinions about how he obtained his wealth. In England, they meet famed European opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson) and convince her to tour the United States as promoted by Barnum. At her first performance, Barnum became infatuated with the 'legitimate' adulation she received and started hiding his band of freaks to the shadows. It is Carlyle who first questioned Barnum, though he himself wasn't ready to be fully associated with them. His inner conflict was growing, however, as he had fallen in love with acrobat Anne Wheeler (Zendaya). Barnum quite abruptly abandoned his circus as Carlyle abruptly became an outcast to his family and his upper crust associates as he fully embraced his new family in Barnum's absence. Almost as quickly as Barnum threw the origins of his success aside, he flipped a 180 and left Lind to finish her American tour without him so he could return to his wife, his children and his circus family. Local protestors threatened to permanently end their dream, but Carlyle's investments saved the day and the show went on. I really only had two big issues with The Greatest Showman. As described above, the flip-flopping of allegiance of both Barnum and Carlyle could have used a little more time in the film to develop and transition. The second was the character of Tom Thumb as played by actor Sam Humphrey, an Australian actor with a skeletal disorder that keeps the 22-year-old actor at a height of 4'3' tall. But that wasn't short enough for the film as they digitally shortened his legs by what appears to be 6 to 8 inches. The problem is that you can tell he was digitally altered in every full-body shot he is in. He is also obviously missing from some wider shot scenes, when he should be in them. During the number 'This is me', the cast of freaks are out in the public streets all performing together. He is there during close-up scenes, but when the camera pulls out, he is noticeably absent.Other than that, the songs really made this show a spectacle and truly entertaining. It starts with an anthemic performance by Hugh Jackman of the show's opening song 'The Greatest Show' that has a similar feel to Queen's 'We Will Rock You'. Efron and Jackman were the perfect pair in their duet in the bar as they sang 'The Other Side'. Efron had a very heart-felt, sweet, sincere, beautiful duet with Zendaya as they battled with their feelings for each other as they sang 'Rewrite the Stars'. And the Bearded Lady Lettie Lutz (Keala Settle) led the cast of the circus in a triumphant singing of 'This is Me'. While the movie sold itself short in it's character and story execution, a shortcoming that really could have been fixed easily with about 20 minutes more, it more than redeemed those downfalls with some amazing original music that should get a couple Oscar nominations and probably one of them taking home the trophy. So, I predicted 4.5 stars for The Greatest Showman, I'm going to lower it just slightly to 4.0 Stars. It was definitely worth the money in the theatre, I'd see it again, and I'll be owning this once it comes out.",8,18,42,22 December 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Gibson's Triumphant Return in Hacksaw Ridge
","Hacksaw Ridge is the story of an Army Medic Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) who was the first to ever receive the Medal of Honor for bravery without having fired a single shot. His father Tom (Hugo Weaving) fought in World War I and it took its toll on Tom who turned to drinking and was often violent with his family. It was his father's violence that prompted Desmond to commit to the Scripture's command that 'Thou shalt not kill.' He refused to even pick up a gun. Things got even tougher for Tom when both of his sons enlisted in the army after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor launching the United States into World War II.Desmond did not get along with his superiors in boot camp due to his opposition to guns and killing. Refusing to train on Saturdays as it is the Sabbath, didn't earn him any popularity points with his fellow trainees either. Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) made his training as hellish as possible and Desmond was beaten in his barracks by the other soldiers who viewed his conscientious objections as cowardice. But Desmond did not give up their names when asked who attacked him. He took everything they threw at him and persevered. The day the squad was released from training, Desmond was arrested for his insubordination making him miss his own wedding day. Only the testimony of his father saved him from a court martial.Desmond's stand against killing continued in Okinawa, Japan as he refused to take up a weapon against the enemy, even though he believed their cause was just. Instead, he regularly risked his own life, unarmed, to aid his wounded brothers away from the front lines to get medical attention. In all, Desmond rescued over 75 men without ever firing a shot.Hacksaw Ridge marks Mel Gibson's return to the Director's chair after a ten year hiatus after Apocalypto in 2006 and The Passion of the Christ in 2004. Hacksaw Ridge has been nominated for 6 Oscars including Best Picture of the Year, Best Leading Actor (Andrew Garfield) and Best Director (Mel Gibson). Gibson 2 for 2 in Oscar wins, both for Braveheart in 1996 that earned him the Best Picture of the Year and Best Director. Hacksaw Ridge is another installment in brutally graphic, tragically realistic, touching and character-driven movies in Gibson's repertoire. I was concerned about Andrew Garfield in this role. He started gaining major recognition with his role in The Social Network in 2010 followed by a reprized role as Peter Parker / Spider-man in two Spider-man movies. But this is quite a different role for Garfield and he more than rose to the occasion. In fact, his performance earned him a Golden Globe nomination (Casey Affleck won for Best Actor in a Drama) and an Oscar nomination.I was also concerned about Vince Vaughn in this very heavy movie. I love him in his comedies, but he failed to impress in the second season of True Detective. Granted, everyone failed to impress in that series follow-up, but particularly Vaughn who wasn't very convincing in his dramatic role. While he was more than adequate in this role, he still proved to be the dimmest star shining in a sea of brightly burning suns. Vaughn will never be mentioned alongside the greats like R Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket, Louis Gosset Jr. in An Officer and a Gentleman, or Christopher Walken in Biloxi Blues. That being said, early comments on the film, the notoriety of Gibson's previous works and the preview made me very optimistic for Hacksaw Ridge, so I gave it an anticipatory 4.0 Star Prediction. And I'm going to stick with it giving it a solid 4.0 Stars. It really had everything. It started with a tragic family story torn apart by alcohol and violence. It had a beautiful love story that was so pure and sweet. It made you love and support Desmond in boot camp and feel for him as his fellow soldiers attacked him. It ended with a brutal, graphic, realistic war reenactment. That is one of Gibson's specialties: graphic violence that isn't just for the sake of being bloody, but rather because that's what actually happened. And that's how you look at it. You don't ask, 'Why did that movie have to be so violent?' Instead, you realize just how violent the war was and that makes Desmond's heroics just that much more incredible. Hacksaw Ridge was well worth the money in the theatre, definitely worth the 6 nominations, and a contender for a spot in my home collection. marksmoviemind.blogspot.com",9,3,6,21 February 2017
