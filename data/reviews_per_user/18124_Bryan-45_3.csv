The Blair Witch Project," How to save money
","If the big deal about TBWP is that it leaves things up to your imagination, just get yourself a good book from the library.  If you're really scaring yourself you can get much better inspiration from any of thousands of books than you will get from this film.Also I miss out on what is scary because I not worried about getting lost in the woods.  I have simple knowledge of the great outdoors that tells me if I can find freshwater I can survive seven days without food following my compass or a stream and will find something before the end of those seven days that will lead to my rescue or return to civilization.Next point is that if the Blair Witch is out to get you, you're dead meat; a powerful supernatural force that has escaped human recognition for all these years is not going to be uncovered by three bumbling students with camcorders.  Rather than losing your mind inside a tent, open the flap and get killed by the supernatural or find out you were going crazy over nothing.  Do what the audience of the film can't do and take charge of the situation rather than slowly losing your mind, like the tent would protect you if the s**t hit the fan anyway.And if you are impressed by the lack of budget, you are just strange.  It costs you the same to see the movie regardless of what it costs to make; be impressed by their ability to promote the movie on the cheap or applaud their financial success; but in no way should you think a movie is better because it was made for less.  Think if this movie is so good why not impress a studio and get some more money to improve the movie before releasing it to the general public; if they did this you could have gained from the low budget as a two-step production would have shown you a better final product.$800,000 (in 1960 dollars) got you a set that is still standing today, the services of one of the greatest directors of all-time, an actual screenplay, known and quality actors and the greatest horror of all-time.  Psycho got the money it needed to provide the audience with everything it could hope for; TBWP just turned $30,000 (in 1999 dollars) into an immediate profit for a select few and what will be nothing more than obscure movie trivia in a few years for the masses.",1,0,3,11 August 1999
The Exorcist," Shock-and-stop
","A few short little clips and an intense ending.  So what; you have 2 more hours to wade through to see those parts that are far more shocking than scary.  There is no question she's possessed, there is no suspense other than who might die by the end of the movie; but quite simply who cares, I knew so little about the characters from weak acting and story that they could all, or none of them, die.A title that quickly comes up in discussions of scary movies but simply doesn't deliver if you actually watch it.",3,2,7,20 August 1999
There's Something About Mary," Great rental
",Obvious appeal is that Cameron Diaz is HOT!!  It's longer term appeal is that 5 years from now when people are renting movies of 'There's something about Mary' genre people will also pick up the original with a short conversation like.This is supposed to be one of the better shock humor movies that Mary spawnedI've never seen MaryYou haven't? We'll rent it then I haven't seen it in a while.Classic - certainly not - but different enough to stand out in your memory - unquestionably.,9,0,0,20 August 1999
