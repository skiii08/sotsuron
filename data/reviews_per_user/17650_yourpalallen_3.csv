Blade Runner 2049," Doom
","I felt a sense of doom with this dreary endless story and ear aching soundtrack. I hated everything about this movie. No action,no story line of any quality. Poor acting, poor cinematography.",1,7,12,28 November 2019
Aquaman," My favorite super hero movie so far
","I loved the story line and how it was unfolded and told. The trailer and movies posters look cheesy and don't give justice to a nice story. It reminds me of John Carter of Mars which I loved too. Action, alien tech, cool cgi, and a babe love story to boot.",10,0,7,28 November 2019
Arrival," False advertisement
","This looked like an action thriller but turned up to be a crap. Aliens arrive and look like giant blobs of something but you never know because there is a convenient glass screen to blow smoke signals and make blubber whale sounds our something awful. The sounds in the theatre actually caused discomfort. Later I watched another movie with an eerie similar sound, Blade Runner, and guess what? Same sorry director and also a dud movie. Some critic described this as a cerebral experience. Nerds. It's not even close to that either. I'm mad I can't get back that time or money wasted on this trash. It's simply put about language communication and some hidden liberal agenda bs and creating world damage.",1,3,12,28 November 2019
