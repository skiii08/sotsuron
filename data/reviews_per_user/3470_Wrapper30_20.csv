Raiders of the Lost Ark," Cinematic Triumph
","I remember going to an old style cinema in Hertford just before it closed down and watching this film when it as 12. I came out of the film realising what it as like to be a kid. This film is a roller-coaster of fun, emotions, highs, lows and superb action. If you want to watch a film and just relax and not necessarily be intellectually challenged, this is the one. It is a perfect family film for all ages to watch. It also features my favourite scene where Indy shoots the swordsman with a tired sigh. This was an accident as it was supposed to be a massive swordfight but Harrison Ford had dysentery. Tom Selleck was originally required but was busy doing Magnum - thanks the film gods for that! Give me Indy over James Bond any time.",9,0,0,11 January 2011
Monty Python's Life of Brian," The funniest film ever made
","This in my opinion is the funniest film ever made and it makes me laugh out loud every time I watch it. There are so many great scenes. 'Welease Woderwick', 'He is not the messiah he is a very naughty boy' and the classic 'What have the Romans ever done for us' make me laugh every time. It is classic British comedy at its best and is slight better than the Holy Grail and The Meaning of Life as it is consistently funny throughout whereas the other 2 are a bit hit and miss. I really cannot understand the big fuss about the supposed anti religious theme. It is in my opinion simply making an inoffensive film to bring enjoyment to all. It is not meant to offend any religion and I feel that some who have taken offence have not watched the whole film. If you haven't seen it then give it a go and I hope it makes you laugh or at least smile.",9,0,2,12 January 2011
Se7en," Fincher;s Finest work.
","I remember wanting to watch Copycat starring Sigourney Weaver and seeing this as a trailer before and thinking it looked good. I left Copycat thinking it was OK and then saw this a month later. I came out and thought wow what a movie. I have seen it numerous times since and it is such a great film on many levels. Brad Pitt's descent in to despair, Morgan Freeman seeking solace from a nameless city he hates to live in, and a simply ingenious set of murders by a crusading yet mad serial killer played sublimely by Spacey. I love the fact that even the dialogue is not clear along with the story so it is impossible to know what is to happen next. In fact over the next couple of days, I think I will watch it again. Brad's best film.",9,1,2,11 January 2011
Happy Gilmore," My Guilty Pleasure
","Yes it is silly, juvenile, crazy and it is not going to win any awards but hey ho, I love it. Yes you have to like Adam Sandler and you do not need to think much. But it is an hour and a half of pleasure for me and always makes me giggle like a little kid. I love the fact that Shooter is such a numpty and you know he is going down. Carl Weathers as Bubbsy is terrifically over the top and Happy even manages to get his wooden hand destroyed but he gets the alligator he did it. There are also hilarious cameos by Richard Kiel as Happy's ex boss complete with the nail from the nail gun Happy fired at him and causing him to be sacked of course and Ben Stiller as an abusive care home assistant. My favourite scene is Happy's fight with his playing partner at a pro-am tournament who is the guy who presents the Price is Right. 'The Price is Wrong bitch'. I like Adam Sandler a lot as his films are the sort of juvenile mindless fun that always cheers me up.",8,0,2,13 January 2011
Finding Nemo," Watching it with the 3 kids now
","This is my favourite Pixar film and I am actually watching it again now with the kids. The years it took to make this and the fine detail are evident every time you watch this. It is like watching a documentary about the ocean as it is absolutely beautiful. It feels like you are watching a beautiful work of art brought to life. It is also such a great story and has a wealth of different characters that are fabulous. I love Crush the 150 year old turtle, Nigel the Pelican and the hilarious seagulls - Mate Mate Mate Mate Mate Mate Mate Mate Mate Mate. Still makes me giggle. Amazing how these films can turn you in to a 7 year old again. My 3 year old Joe is looking at me as if I am nuts. Willem Defoe is superb as Gill and Ellen DeGeneres is hilarious as Dory. How do Pixar get it so right? Sequel anyone?",9,0,2,12 January 2011
Interstellar," The Emperor's New Clothes
","I sent to see Interstellar on Saturday night and have just spent 45 incredulous minutes reading the reviews. The film I went to see was dull, preposterous and far far far too long. Let's start with the idea. A good one but poorly displayed. I wanted to know more about how humanity was destroying the planet. All I got was old folk I am guessing talking about the duststorms of the 1920's and 1930's? Perhaps they were attempting to lay the foundation for the whole premise of the film? I also wanted to know more about Cooper but we didn't really see how he became a farmer other than the flashback at the start. When did his wife die? Why is his father in law living with him? Did we really get to understand the relevance of the droid they chased in the truck? Unfortunately most of the film is taken up with barely audible dialogue about scientific hypothesis and personal issues intertwined together. This made it very difficult to follow and the interest wanes as a result. BUT the biggest downfall of the film is Matt Damon. I am a fan off his but not in this. He is dreadfully miscast as the villain of the piece of sorts and that whole fight with Cooper and Ryan is poor. It is just not convincing at all and there is no suspense involved in the whole docking scene at all. Cooper just tells him not to dock as he hasn't got the codes but you never felt Ryan was in jeopardy. It was so poorly constructed. Overall vey similar to Inception in that it is at times visually stunning but rather like Inception it is style over substance. Beautiful to look at but like opening a strawberry cream in a box of Quality Street - very disappointing. And the title of my review? I am just a bit fed up that Nolan has made some fine early films and now nobody will criticise him? In The Emperors New Clothes nobody tells the Emperor he is wearing nothing until a little boy informs him. Somebody needs to tell Nolan that he needs to get back to crafting films full of suspense and not a plodding sci-fi full of characters you barely care about.",3,25,53,24 November 2014
The Exorcist," My favourite film of all time.
",This is more than a mere horror film but a classic case of good against evil. The book is excellent and for once a director captures it on film perfectly. All the main parts are played with passion and realism. The story starts slowly with flashes of evil placed to unnerve and keep you on your toes. Then a sudden change in pace whacks you round the head and makes your head spin till the chilling finale. This lived with me for years from my first view at the age of 12. I plucked up the courage to watch it again in my early 30's and learned to appreciate it more. The film has benefited from recent revamps and Mark Kermode's documentary aids to the appreciation. Freidkin is my favourite director for this film alone.,10,2,4,11 January 2011
Insidious," Poorly Executed Good Idea
","I was expecting great things of this after reading good reviews and seeing typically enticing trailers. However, I was enthralled then badly let down. It reminded me of Jeepers Creepers because of the great first half and dreadful second. The first held of the film creates the idea nicely and we work out the different characters and their issues. The boy's fall is handled well and his false coma explained. Then the scares come and they are well done and it reaches the inevitable angst of the parents. A little unneeded humour is added with the paranormal investigators but that is where the film starts getting sillier and your interest wains. Firstly the gas masks - why? Then the inevitable tag-line - it is not your house but your son and it is explained where he is etc and I thought let's forget the silliness and get back to the dread and fear. But the music and feel of the other zone is ruined by the people on the sofa and then the dreadful old style rendition of Tiptoe through the Tulips. Why as it just totally destroyed all tension. And the ending was lazy and totally unsatisfactory. Great idea, good first half but poor second and totally unsatisfactory ending. Don't make a sequel. Just make a better ghost story.",4,0,1,8 October 2011
Jurassic World," A return to the Summer blockbuster
","To be honest I am astounded by the criticism on here and the pedants having a pop about tiny plot holes. At the end of the day it is a welcome return to the summer blockbuster. The best film I have seen since Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and my favourite film alongside Zodiac this century. fast paced, great acting, super effects and monsters. No Jeff Goldblum thankfully so in my view better than all the first 3 films put together. BUT the best thing is Chris Pratt. He was great in Guardians of the Galaxy and now he carries the film manfully on his shoulders. Funny Sexy Clever Passionate and damn fine acting. It was 2 hours of thorough enjoyment. It won't win any Oscars but who cares about those films? Stop thinking about small inaccuracies and enjoy it for the thrill ride it is. ABSOLUTELY FAB!",9,32,93,23 June 2015
The Dark Knight," Heath Ledger RIP
","This is certainly the best Batman film by some distance. Nolan's direction is superb and it is visually stunning. But it is the absolutely outstanding performance by Heath Ledger that launches it from very good to outstanding. He is well assisted by Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart but he takes it to another level. His performance is scarily realistic and makes you believe that throughout all the heartache suffered by the other characters, he is unbreakable. You cannot hurt him mentally or physically unless you kill him. One weak point, Bale's silly gruff accent as Batman is a little absurd. It is an outstanding film nonetheless.",9,1,3,11 January 2011
Midsommar," Perhaps I just don't get it
",Right let's get one thing clear - I hated Hereditary. Well maybe not hated as I found the last 30 minutes hilarious. So I watched Midsommar with an open mind as much as I could.It was awful.The main character didn't help as I could not empathize with her at all. I found her annoying and a blank canvas to be honest. The other characters ranged from equally annoying to uninteresting. So it's very difficult to engage in a movie if the main characters have no endearing qualities or acting qualities leave you cold.The plot? Telegraphed and Cliched I am afraid. It felt like a Swedish rip off of the Wicker Man. There is no real discernable reason for the climax. Yes the main characters were annoying and frankly I could not care less what happened to them but why? Is it a sacrifice to the Gods or a blood lust? Nobody really explained why their customs were such other than a cringeworthy explanation of the suicide of the two elders.The soundtrack was clunky and made you wince. The cinematography made you nauseous but I guess that was deliberate. The ending was bland and at no point during this or any other part of the film did I feel peril or menace. I sat there waiting for it to end as it meandered along like a drunk walking home on a Saturday night. You knew what was going to happen and when it did? Just plain silly.A very good idea wasted by poor acting and a horribly confused and cliched storyline. Avoid. It doesn't come anywhere near to the hype.;,2,13,20,27 September 2019
Once Upon a Time in America," Definitely in my Top 5
",This is in my opinion the greatest of all the gangster movies and certainly the most underrated. I love the way the film slips seamlessly between their 'childhood' to De Niro leaving prison as an adult. James Woods can not have had a finer performance in his career. The score is fantastic and fits like a glove to the action. The ending is as thought provoking as you can get and leaves you asking several questions. The rape scene is undoubtedly shocking but epitomises their relationship and De Niro's frustration and his descent in to madness. For me this is far better than the Godfather movies and slightly more enjoyable than the more modern Goodfellas.,9,0,3,11 January 2011
Jaws," Old but Gold
","I have always loved this film but watching the 2 hour documentary on how it was made recently on the Bio channel, it made me realise what an absolute triumph it was. Spielberg dragged this film up by the scruff of the neck and made this film a classic. It was dogged by technical issues, budget problems and a massive lack of support from the studio. The crux of the film's success lies in the camaraderie between the main characters, most of which were 2nd, 3rd or 4th choices. One of my favourite scenes is where Brodie is brought back to reality by his son imitating him at his dining table. Beautiful. That is why the vast majority of Spielberg's films are so successful because he makes the characters so believable and vulnerable and so we care about them.",9,6,10,11 January 2011
Inception," Very Disappointed
","I couldn't wait to watch this film but boy was it disappointing. It was a fantastic idea and yes it looked great. However, the main problem for me was that the characters were drawn so poorly in conjunction with the visuals that I did not really care what happened to them. I loved Momento and The Dark Knight but the crucial difference is that I cared about Guy Pearce and Christian Bale. It may be perhaps that I do not rate De Caprio but I could care less about what his predicament was. I even tried watching it 3 times to see if I was missing anything but ended up getting annoyed. Visually stunning there is no doubt and an amazing concept but emotionally shallow.",6,8,13,11 January 2011
Sherlock Holmes," Hang your Head in Shame Mr Ritchie
","I had the misfortune to watch this drivel. Well actually it took me 5 attempts to finish it. There are many questions I have. 1. Why reinvent Sherlock Holmes as a bad mannered, oafish, irresponsible buffoon of a man? 2. He is completely devoid of any social skills so how does he develop his insight in to people? 3. Did Guy actually read any of the novels? Arthur Conan Doyle must be turning in his grave. 4. What was the ending all about? It was nonsensical. 5. How could Dr Watson not tell that the villain was dead after being hung? Surely his neck would have been broken. Mind you it was Jude Law which is inept casting at the very least. 6. How does Jude Law get work? 7. How does Rachel McAdams get work? All 3 films I have seen her in have been drivel. I read that another film is being made. Please no no no no. Absolutely dreadful.",2,2,3,14 January 2011
The Conjuring," Great First Half
","I sat down and watched the Conjuring not expecting a lot and then after an hour was pleasantly surprised. It was scary, well crafted, acted well, good rhythm, unobtrusive soundtrack. BUT all is well that ends well. Err no. What happened in the second half. It was hurried, unrealistic and completely out of character for Carolyn Perron up to that point and became simply preposterous. Why do Hollywood do this. Take a good story and chuck in some spectacular (not) exorcism type set-pieces. It has nothing to do with the Devil at all so why change a perfectly good story and sensationalise it. Very very disappointed after an amazing first hour.",5,0,1,9 December 2014
The Silence of the Lambs," Great film based on a super book
","I had read this book by Thomas Harris and thought it would make a great movie but was concerned when I heard that Jonathan Demme was making it. How wrong I was though and I was overwhelmingly surprised. It was the first film about a serial killer where it did not rely on strong elements of violence and gore but simply left it to the imagination. Obviously Hopkins and Foster get all the plaudits and rightly so but this is one of the only films that has so many superb minor characters such as Barney, Ardelia Mapp and Bill himself. I urge those who like this movie to watch the making of documentary as it is truly fascinating. A roller-coaster ride of emotions and tension which I enjoy every time I watch it.",9,3,5,12 January 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Enjoyable yet predictable. Disappointing.
",I sat down last night on New Years Eve replacing the festivities with a big blockbuster that I was looking forward to watching. One word to describe it is disappointing. It just does not reach the heights of the second film and the main reason for that is the villain. This is not the fault of the 3rd film really as Heath Ledger was just fantastic in the 2nd film. It is that Bane is just so one dimensional in comparison and that is not down to Tom Hardy in any way. There just needed to be more mystique and terror around him but he was just a big lump with a fairly incoherent and gruff voice. And Catwoman? Sorry but Anne Hathaway is just not good enough to play this role and her turn to be at Wayne's side at the end-preposterous. And Blake to be Robin was telegraphed from the moment he came on the screen. AND all the police force to get caught down the sewers-ppllleeaasse no. BUT it was worth 8 out of 10 as it was a spectacular blockbuster let down by a little weakness in the plot and one dimensional characterisation.,8,5,9,1 January 2013
Godzilla," Poor
",Really looking forward to a far superior version than the underrated Matthew Broderick Godzilla. More modern and edgier with a far greater fear of peril. However I was very very disappointed. Started promisingly with Bryan Cranston's character and his apparent paranoia over the death of his wife and a cover up involved. Whilst the story centred around him it was an interesting slow burner. However when it shifts to Johnson as the main character that is where the film starts to die a death. He was great in KickAss as an underdog but simply awful and wooden as the main hero of the plot. His range of emotions and expressions are simply not there. A raised eyebrow here and an attempt at angst or fear was just unbelievable. But this wasn't the only gripe about the last hour or so. The main one is the film is just too dark to follow. You cannot really see the special effects and as a result it is confusing and lacks care. A lot of promises but sadly like finding a coffee cream in your box of chocolates. Looked good and promising enough to begin but goes sour and unsatisfying.,4,0,3,24 March 2015
The Social Network," Was it worth the Hype?
","I faced viewing this film for the first time with a lot of doubt and trepidation. The plot and story did not fill me with an overwhelming anticipation or real desire to watch it. I just wanted to see what the fuss was about. However, I was very pleasantly surprised to find I really enjoyed it and found the whole theme riveting and the move experience extremely enjoyable. It was superbly directed and well acted with a storyline that grabbed attention throughout. All the main characters were absolute horrific and people who I would steer well clear from but that is what is so good about the film is that it is so believable. You didn't care who won or lost. In fact you wanted them all to lose. But it was so riveting that you wanted to know what happened. It was a pleasant surprise but i should not have doubted the man who thrilled me with Zodiac and Seven. A modern classic - enjoy!",8,0,0,25 April 2011
