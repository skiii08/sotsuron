The Ring," one sleepless night later...
","I'm not going to write a review of this movie so much as tell you how it has affected me. I am and always have been a horror movie fanatic. I was raised on Puppet Master, Return of the Living Dead, Phantasm, Halloween, etc. I would say that I am pretty desensitized. I WOULD say that, but I won't because apparently I'm not. I watched this film last night with a few friends in my apartment. At the time, it seemed good and scary, just my type of movie. That was until everyone went home and my roommate went to sleep. I blame this on hormones plus it being late, but once I walked into my bedroom, my anxiety skyrocketed. I paced around the apartment for awhile before finally giving in to the possibility of some sleep at about 2 AM. Yeah, right. Radio on, door closed, no closet, lamp on and I still couldn't relax enough to get any shut eye. Every 15 minutes my eyes would fly open and I would peer around the room to get my barings. This is horrible. I have never lost sleep over a movie, and I've seen it all. All of these years I've never understood people who disliked horror films, but I think this one sleepless terrified night is all that it will take to sympathize forever. See it. It's fantastic. I still love a good scary movie, even though it has made me lose one nights sleep. Now I'm just concerned about tomorrow night..",Null,1,1,6 March 2003
Memento," Brilliant film making.
","Christopher Nolan is a phenomenal director. Period. A film this good doesn't even need my praise.Guy Pierce is perfect. As an afterthought, I was rather perturbed by the fact that the Special Edition DVD came out nearly a year after the original DVD. What about those of us who were loyal and had Memento reserved months before it's release? Why do we get screwed? Heather",10,1,2,2 September 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Eye and Ear Candy
","I love this movie! It is the third in Baz Lurhman's 'Red Curtain Trilogy' and by far the most stunning. The same old story, told in an incredible way, Moulin Rouge follows naive Christian (Ewan Mcgregor) into Monte Martre, the world of sin. Here he meets the beautiful Satine (Nicole Kidman), and instantly falls in love. THe plot is predictable, but IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE! This film is a common story told in an extraordinary way. The sets are gorgeous, and Ewan and Nicole have got enough chemistry to carry the film themselves. The supporting cast is wonderful as well, but nothing can compare to the music. Sung by the cast themselves, the collage of modern songs in original ways will take your breath away! Heather",10,1,2,2 September 2002
Heat," A spectacular film about the people behind the drama
","While most movies are too concerned with the crime than the criminals, Heat shows you humanity in the style of Thomas Harris (esp. Red Dragon). They're not just faceless evil, but people. Bob Deniro is fantastic as the leader of a group preparing for another heist, while Al Pacino is the cop in charge of apprehending him. An excellent cast including Tom Sizemore, Amy Brenneman, Val Kilmer, Ted Levine, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Tom Noonan, and young Natalie Portman. Every actor plays a part in this thick and tense drama, and all do it exceptionally. Michael Mann has more than proven himself as a director with this film. The hauntingly beautiful score just adds to the tone of this great film. Set aside a good 3 hours to watch it.",10,0,0,2 September 2002
