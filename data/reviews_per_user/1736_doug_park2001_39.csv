Black Swan," 'It's MY turn!'
","Natalie Portman adequately plays Nina, a slightly over-the-hill ballerina who's subject to hallucinations and self-mutilation, not to mention jealous cohorts, a perverted exploitative slimeball dance director, and a creepy overbearing mother who's a retired ballerina herself. Her primary nemesis--besides, perhaps, herself?--is Lily, a rival fellow dancer and eerie younger lookalike well-played by Mila Kunis.I really tried to like BLACK SWAN. Its whole plot and set-up is something nicely different, and it at least begins to allow us some empathy with a victim of SIB, raising (however briefly) interesting questions regarding victim-victimizer relationships. The whole premise of how ballet imitates life and vice versa and how all the major players here are also dancers in life's suite has a lot of potential; unfortunately, it just doesn't play out as well as it could and probably won't mean that much to the average viewer. This film also constantly tries for scary and suspenseful, but the effect is just silly.This might have worked better as a more conventional drama (keeping the symbolic roles) about the cutthroat competition and jealousies that take place between dancers who try to sabotage each others' careers and performances. It also would have helped immensely if the symphonic soundtrack had been saved for the dance performances and not pervaded the bar scenes, Nina's apartment, and everywhere else.",6,2,3,28 February 2014
Changeling," 'Never pick a fight, but always finish it'
","I expected CHANGELING to be good but, considering its 142-minute length, also expected some draggy spots. I was wrong on the second count: There isn't one dull moment here. This is one of the few films to come out in the last decade or so that I think deserves at least minor classic status. Fine acting (especially by Jolie but by everyone else as well), a riveting yet well-paced and intelligent storyline. . . just a very fine film in every aspect.CHANGELING is frightening, provocative, and heartwarming all at once. One of the many things this story shows us is how a governmental/police bureaucracy can make the most innocent people seem guilty and the most sane people appear nuts. CHANGELING also provides a clear, immediate portrayal of the late 1920s/early 1930s, revealing how, though very different insofar as technology and styles are concerned, this period was much the same as our contemporary age.",10,2,3,5 February 2014
Captain Phillips," 'You're not just a fisherman!'
","All politics aside, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS has a gripping plot with excellent all-around acting and cinematography. The storyline is straightforwardly simple, without a lot of extraneous nonsense. Even though the audience already knows basically what will happen and how it will most likely wind up, there are a number of unexpected minor twists. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS also gives a very convincing portrayal of life on a modern U.S. freighter. Regardless of how faithful to the actual story it is--and there are always some changes in that area--I also like the fact that there are no unconvincing heroics (hair's-breadth rescues, etc) here, with a very believable and effective ending.Some may not like the micro-view this film gives, without anything in the way of news flashes back home, the reactions of the crews' families after the hijacking of the ship, etc. That would, however, have detracted from the tension and forward motion of the film and unnecessarily complicated things. Still, a little more on what happens with the MV Maersk Alabama and the pirate mother-ship later in the story would have been a plus.",8,0,2,28 April 2014
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," 'Let's Go Be Psychos Together'
","THE PERKS of BEING a WALLFLOWER is extremely poignant, well-acted, and well-filmed. It begins, I think deliberately, with the usual clich√©s and stereotypes of high school existence: Charlie the shy little freshman getting his class copy of TO KILL a MOCKINGBIRD ripped up by a bullyish senior, Charlie sitting alone during the big prom, etc. It quickly evolves, however, into something much more realized. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller particularly shine as Charlie's new friends, found seemingly by accident (as they often are), and their entire weird artsy kids circle is SO immediately engrossing and believable.Understandably, many comparisons have been made with THE BREAKFAST CLUB, and, though PERKS is also set in the age of cassette tapes and typewriters, it appeals to the heart in the same timeless way, making it another film that's likely to survive and be watched many years from now.PERKS is not flawless. Some of the themes and details--e.g., elements such as sister Candace's tumultuous relationship with 'Ponytail Derek,' Charlie's abuse as a child at the hands of his now-deceased aunt, Charlie's mental illness--don't always interrelate or play significant roles in the story. Various details--e.g., while this is supposedly set in 1991-2, computers are still apparently unknown--are also out of whack. Yet, these factors apparently don't bother many others, and PERKS is a good enough film that even the imperfections serve to humanize and perhaps even make it better. The more I think about it, everything that goes on here IS quite relevant in simply showing the complexities of growing up and being human.",8,3,7,31 March 2013
Gravity," 'You should see the Sun on the Ganges!'
","GRAVITY is fine if you just take it for what it is: A sci-fi thriller that is watchably compelling, with a number of twists and turnabouts, but without a lot of plot depth, character development, or any of that sort of thing. It has a few stretches and improbabilities, but it's awfully hard to make a film of this sort without some of those. Comparisons have been made with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, but GRAVITY does not begin to hold the slightest nubbin of a candle to a classic of that stature. All the same, good performances by Bullock (Dr. Ryan Stone) and Clooney ('veteran astronaut' Matt Kowalski), who are the only living characters we actually see here. Though the Earth below looks rather artificial, some nice use of gadgetry and special effects.I put off watching GRAVITY because it looked fairly predictable. It does, however, go in some unexpected directions. Yet, the story starts a bit too late: More on the nature of the shuttle mission and the relationships between Stone, Kowalski, and the rest of the crew before the disasters strike would have added something even if it would also have complicated things. Purely a matter of taste, but I think the middle portions would have benefited from more on the angst and strange thoughts that arise while trapped alone in space and less of the constant thriller-diller stuff we have here.",6,0,3,3 March 2014
Lone Survivor," 'There's a storm inside of us'
","Based on the true story of Operation Red Wings, 2005, LONE SURVIVOR is gripping, well-acted, and well-filmed. It shows in no uncertain terms what it's like to train and fight in an outfit like the Navy Seals. Lots of death and violence, but no really blatant gore.LONE SURVIVOR is too grimly realistic to function simply as a cheesy war thriller, which is good. Still, shoot-'em-up scenes in the mountains of Afghanistan very much predominate. That, of course, was mostly what ORW consisted of: Some will like this quality of the film while others won't. Nevertheless, LONE SURVIVOR would have been better if there had been more back-story on local Taliban leader Ahmad Shah's activities, as well as more on the specific politics of the region and the operation. More of an alternating focus on the Seals, the Taliban, and the neighboring villagers would also have been a plus.One small but glaring anachronism: Rattlesnakes? In Afghanistan?",7,1,5,2 March 2014
The Hunger Games," Theseus, Romeo, and Juliet meet Survivor, Rollerball, and Logan's Run
","THE HUNGER GAMES is one of those films that can interpreted a million different ways. . . or can just be just watched for pure entertainment. Excellent cinematography, costume design, and soundtrack along with a very unique storyline help to create a really memorable screen experience. The acting-in-general is contrived and overly perfecto, and there are definitely a few holes and cop-outs in the plot. Yet, THE HUNGER GAMES is so one-of-a-kind that its flaws, some of which would be ruinous in a lesser film, are forgivable.All the same, there are ways that THE HUNGER GAMES might have been better; e.g., it would have been a plus to see more virtually created creature phenomena such as the were-pitbulls (or whatever they are) toward the end. Another thing: Considering the brutality of the premise, what actually happens during the 'game' is fairly tame. Having said that, I'm not sure how it would have worked better--It certainly would NOT have been enhanced by creating a horrific 'It's either me or you' gore-fest. It often descends into sentimental, politically correct, teeny-bopperish romance, but just when things start to get too maudlin, new things arise.I am sure that this film does not do complete justice to the book trilogy, which I have not read but am now very eager to read. The mere fact that the film version made me--and I'm sure many others--want to read the books says something for it.",8,0,4,27 April 2013
The Impossible," As Good as Most People Say It Is
","Though it's a straightforwardly based-upon-a-true story, THE IMPOSSIBLE still has its share of surprises and turnabouts. The cover blurb from Mary Pols (TIME) says 'Emotionally rich and life-affirming.' I agree, but it should also be noted that this film earns every bit of its various life-affirming qualities. The initial scenes of the tsunami and its aftermath are heart-stopping in places: This is definitely one of the more disturbing PG-13s that I've seen. It's also the first film I've seen in a long while that honestly brought tears to my eyes.While the pacing could use a little more of this and a little less of that, THE IMPOSSIBLE is expertly filmed and acted. Lush scenery too: It made me want to go to Thailand in spite of everything shown here. Fine performances by Watts and McGregor, with special kudos going to Tom Holland as eldest son Lucas. The Special Features are all worth a serious look.",9,3,7,2 June 2013
42," An Engaging and Inspiring Bio-Drama
","Though I'm not even a baseball person, I found '42' an utterly compelling and vividly realistic film. The level of empathy the audience attains with Robinson in all the adversity he faces is quite acute. Really fine acting by virtually all of the cast, but most particularly Chadwick Boseman as Robinson, Harrison Ford as the team owner with a most revolutionary idea, and Alan Tudyk as racist Phillies manager Ben Chapman. A fine and convincing script also helps to make this film the success that it is.Still, the scope of the film has its limitations. '42' would have been enhanced by a more all-inclusive biography of Robinson in regard to his earlier life and service in WWII. While in high school and junior college, Robinson excelled at four different sports: Baseball, basketball, football, and track. Some revelation of why he sought to play in the then highly racist--even for that time--Major Leagues would have been a plus. Instead of simply having one of the characters tell us that, while serving as an army officer, he had been court-martialed for refusing to move to the back of a military bus, it would have been nice to actually SEE that happen via flashback. The directors let it be known that Robinson had a fiery temper. More illustration of this quality--and how/why he was forced to restrain it under circumstances that would have tried the most saintly patience--would have made '42' even better.",8,1,1,14 August 2013
Argo," Compelling 1980-like Film
","Tip: If you are unfamiliar with the story and fate of the six Americans who escaped from the U.S. Embassy during the hostage crisis in Tehran, 1980, it might work better if you do not read any more about it before watching this film in order to allow more element of surprise.Either way, however, ARGO is quite gripping, and even those of us who remember the event(s) will find the new information (declassified in 1997) an interesting spin. Moreover, even those who already know how the basic story comes out should find human interest and a compelling narrative in the micro-events of how it all (supposedly) occurred.Many have complained that ARGO has a TV Land feeling to it. I agree, and consider that one of the film's strongest points. It's easy to understand why many who are used to today's finely tuned film production are disappointed or at least dismayed by ARGO's atmosphere. Its subject is neither 'current' nor what most of us consider 'history.' Ergo, the straightforward and unsensationalized cinematography helps to capture the mood of these events and also contributes to the time setting, i.e., really harks back to 1980.Excellent script: Especially insofar as the CIA and State Department are concerned, it made me think, 'That's how the talks must have gone.' The news bits and recreation of the demonstrations in Tehran are equally mesmerizing. There were times when I wished for subtitles of all the chanting and certain other dialogue from the Iranians, but at the same time, I like the way it allows room for anyone not fluent in Farsi to sense the gist of it all.Though his acting performance is stilted, Affleck's direction of this film is truly fine, and the acting by most of the other major players, particularly those who play the would-be hostages and those who play the Iranians, is quite commendable.",8,0,2,21 March 2013
About Time," 'All the time travel in the world can't make someone love you'
","ABOUT TIME is a fantasy-comedy where a subject we often wonder about becomes reality for its protagonist. What if we could go back in time and redo our bad decisions, erase every faux pas, remove all our foots-in-mouth, etc? Though quietly funny and entertaining, the first half-hour or so meanders a bit, but things pick up, and the last half-hour is powerfully moving. ABOUT TIME is seldom just laugh-out-loud funny; however, there is a quietly whimsical humor throughout. Good acting by Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, as well as by everyone else, but the best of all comes from Bill Nighy as Tim's dad, a truly memorable character. The cinematography is also excellent, with some fine views of the Cornwall, England, coast. Great script and great soundtrack too. Despite the fantastic elements, this is a film about real people that, like many British productions, moves at the speed of life. Therefore, people who want a lot of excitement and explosive action may be a little bored with it.",8,3,4,12 April 2014
Spotlight," 'If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to abuse one'
","The single most remarkable thing about this film is how it uses a confined scope to its advantage rather than otherwise, something that would only be possible in a docudrama of this sort. The makers of 'Spotlight' were obviously seeking to avoid cheap sensationalism. There is no use of flashback, and the interviews with the now-adult victims are brief yet detailed enough to make their point. There is little showing of the pedophiliac priests, and the public outcry that followed the first exposures of the scandal in Boston and throughout the world is effectively limited to the after-notes. Yet, it as if you are the proverbial fly on the wall of the 'Boston Globe' and flying along with their reporters on the street. While a film of this sort will never have huge mass appeal--which may in itself be several strikes in its favor--it's two-plus well-worth-it hours for anyone with a serious interest in the whole explosive affair within the Roman Catholic church. I was utterly entranced.The details and complications are hard to completely follow on first view, and the sheer number of characters makes it difficult to place who's-who in some cases. That doesn't, however, conflict too much with the big picture. 'Spotlight' is also quite revealing of the dilemmas and politics that take place within a newspaper office and its dealings with local VIPs.Much of the success of 'Spotlight' is, of course, due to the fine, fine quality of the acting and script. Special kudos to Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and all the actors who play the various victims. The subtle development of 'characters' such as the cantankerous but obsessively dedicated and conscientious attorney Mitchell Garabedian (similarly well-played by Stanley Tucci) is also commendable.",9,3,6,7 December 2015
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Intelligently Done and Believable Spy Film
","During the height of the Cold War in the early '70s, a British In-tel operation is trying to uncover a mole in its ranks who's giving the Soviets some info that's, at least apparently, about as crucial as crucial can be. Although I haven't read the book or seen the original '79 film, I found the whole story and presentation here very engaging. TTSS is one of the few films of its type dealing with some very BIG conflicts yet lacking elements that seem contrived or too much of a stretch. Given close attention, the storyline is lucid enough, has some well-done and believable surprises, and does not just mess with one's head for the sake of it. It's also a very revealing look at the whole cynical business of international spying/intelligence. Fine acting, particularly from Mark Strong, Gary Oldman, David Dencik, and Colin Firth. TTSS is obviously a bit too slow-moving for the fast action crowd. The large cast of characters is also a bit hard to keep track of on first view. Non-British audiences may need the subtitles due to the heavy accents and use of slang in this film. All the same, TTSS should appeal not only to international intrigue aficionados, but to anyone who's ever been in a group situation of any sort that's full of bad politics, everyone suspicious of everyone else, etc.",8,2,3,1 July 2013
The Flowers of War," 'Sometimes the truth is the last thing we need to hear'
","THE FLOWERS of WAR is a disturbing yet touching film that truly captures the horrors of the Japanese occupation of Nanking, 1937. Long, graphically realistic scenes of war violence and carnage, as well as the numerous rapes which often ended in murder. Though the transformation in his character from totally selfish to completely selfless is a little sudden, Christian Bale gives a strong performance as John Miller. Virtually all of the Chinese ladies--both the Winchester Cathedral girls and the courtesans--are similarly well-portrayed. The beautifully peaceful singing by the choir girls provides a believable contrast to the horrors going on all around them. Special mention should also be given to Dawei Tong as Major Li.While THE FLOWERS of WAR puts no blankets over the brutality of this event, it also shows both sides of the Japanese coin. Even at their most barbaric, the marauding soldiers still come across as eminently human. Humans, of course, can be pretty terrible, but regardless, I know of very few western films that succeed so well in portraying the WWII-era Japanese as something other than just faceless, sinister, bestial monsters. The ending is unexpected, heart-rending, but similarly believable.",8,0,0,28 April 2014
The Book Thief," 'Words are life, Liesel'
","THE BOOK THIEF is the most poignant and haunting film that I have seen in some time, one that will stay with me for years. Sophie N√©lisse gives an outstanding performance as Liesel Meminger, an initially illiterate but incredibly imaginative and independent girl who's full of unique metaphors and similes --e.g., 'The sun looks like a silver oyster'--and, with the help of various diverse people, discovers the power of books and the written word while living with foster parents in Hitler's Germany. Virtually every other player in this film gives a fine performance, and the very special narrator, Roger Allam as the somber yet strangely unforbidding voice of Death, adds a distinct touch, coming in at just the right crucial moments.I have never seen anything remotely like THE BOOK THIEF and can only say that I wish there were more like it. The best way I can describe it is like a dark yet ultimately heartwarming Disney film for adults. It is, of course, a Fox 2000 production expertly directed by Englishman Brian Percival, spoken mostly in English--albeit, with some speeches in German w/English subtitles--with a cast of various nationalities. Still, the characters are all most convincingly German. It captures the lives of ordinary German citizens during WWII in a way I've never seen done in any non-German film. The accents and various mannerism are very, very real and immediate. The cinematography is also excellent, with stunning views of the town and countryside and, even when viewed from approaching Allied bombers, the sky above them. THE BOOK THIEF is driven mostly by its characters, themes, and atmosphere. Nevertheless, even if it takes a while to find itself, the plot also makes perfect sense (allowing for the various elements of magical realism), moves at a natural pace, and is ultimately quite gripping.Though I loved every second of this film, a common criticism seems to be that it simply does not do justice to Markus Zusak's original novel. Film adaptations, of course, often make serious departures from the books that spawned them, and it's fairly impossible to completely capture a really great novel on screen. Though I have not yet read the novel, I could tell that the directors and writers had a lot to pick and choose regarding what/whatnot to show. There are a few patchy spots: In particular, I wanted a little better sense of Liesel's origins. In this respect, I can only say that this film should prove an excellent illuminator for the book, which I am now eager to read.",9,9,16,28 February 2014
Life of Pi," 'Hunger can change everything you thought you knew about yourself'
","Having yet to read the book, I watched the film mainly as an illumininator for the novel, which I am now eager to start. I can only say that LIFE of PI is like no other film that I have ever seen. I expected it to be good but also feared it might have some of those fluffy 'Oh, aren't I deep and brilliant?!' qualities. My fears proved baseless. LIFE of PI incorporates mystical and philosophical themes very well without detracting from its very engaging storyline. It's also touching and poignant without being the least bit sentimental. Despite a few choppy bits, there isn't a seriously dull moment here. Suraj Sharma/Irrfan Khan play the protagonist quite convincingly, but it's the fine cinematography that really makes this film. Absolutely stunning views of the ocean and its life and, of course, Richard Parker the tiger and various other animals.",9,1,3,30 July 2013
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," 'Anger begets anger'
","The first half-hour or so vacillates somewhat, going around in apparent circles, but TBOEM delivers quite well in the end. This film is everything a noir comedy should be. It's satirical of many things: love, marriage, family, small town life, small town cops and police-in-general, life and mortality, younger people, and older people. Though, like most noir films, TBOEM is VERY profane, gritty, and violent, a subtle compassion and a definite moral ultimately comes through, and it avoids the pitfall of simply being tasteless for the sake of being tasteless. Fine acting by just about the entire cast, with special kudos going to Frances McDormand and Caleb Jones. Fittingly ironic soundtrack too. The one or two brief scenes which digress from the steady dark humor of the rest of the film are well-done and effective, as is the beautiful scenery and cinematography. Finally, it's extremely gripping, always making you wonder what will happen next, with many surprises.Some of the more critical reviews have noted the various plot-holes in this film, which cannot be denied, but hey, it's comedy, which allows for more than the usual suspension of disbelief. TBOEM easily gets away with its stretches in the end.",8,1,3,26 February 2018
The Lost City of Z," 'Nothing will happen to us that is not our destiny'
","Many people will approach this film expecting to see a riveting historical adventure. While there is a great deal of compelling expos√© of Percy Fawcett and crew's exploration of the Amazon, encounters with Indians, wild beasts, and so forth, as well as some tense battle scenes of the WWI Battle of the Somme, those people are likely to be disappointed in the end. 'The Lost City of Z' is more of a philosophical think-piece and character study of a tragic hero than anything else. The story of how Percy Fawcett must find the Lost City that he has no certainty actually exists, even when it means probable death and neglect of his own family, is thought-provoking, but no more so than many other films of this type. We don't really empathize that much with Fawcett's obsessions, mainly because the film doesn't make the unexplored Amazon seem terribly alluring, nor does it really show what makes him so confident the City is out there somewhere.Some plot-holes and ambiguities, but nothing just ruinous. LCZ is basically watchable, with some pronounced draggy spots. Yet, it lacks that necessary something it needs to make it truly satisfying. The whole mood of the film is somber in a way that's likely to lose much of the audience. There have also been some criticisms of its lack of historical accuracy. I'm not really sure of the real story, but like most 'docudramas,' LCZ should certainly be taken with a dose of salt.All this being said, the acting by all is quite good, and Charlie Hunnam (Fawcett) is an actor we're likely to see more of in the future. Same for the cinematography and directions, particularly in how LCZ utilizes details of its setting in time: It really takes us back to the early 1900s.",7,0,2,24 April 2017
American Hustle," 'The art of survival is a story that never ends'
","American HUSTLE is a whimsical social satire on greed and the amoral rat & mouse game of FBI/governmental entrapment, with a lot of insightful stuff about the world of appearances, selfish human agendas, and the phoniness in general behind them all. Set in the late 1970s, it captures (and ridicules)that era very well, especially with its use of 70s theme music for specific scenes.While American HUSTLE kept my attention throughout its two-plus-hour length, it may move a little too slowly for some tastes and could definitely use more hard tension. Much of the persistent humor is of the smirk-guffaw variety. There are also frequent attempts at lol-slapstick, but the exploding microwaves and one guy beating another over the head with a telephone just aren't particularly funny. This film would probably have worked better if it had just stuck to dry satirical humor, keeping the one hilarious exception of the impromptu after-the-big-bust party by the feds. Anyway, there are some twisty surprises here and there, not all of which are very believable, and it ties up a bit too easily at the end. Though American HUSTLE works well as light but meaningful entertainment, the fact that it just doesn't go as far and deep as it could have keeps it from being the rip-roaring success it might have been. Better plotting, more suspense, and sharper surprise elements could have won that Oscar.All the same, Christian Bale (as not-so-bad-a-guy con artist Irving Rosenfeld), Amy Adams (as Rosenfeld's indispensable cohort Sydney Prosser), and Bradley Cooper (as self-serving FBI agent Richie DiMaso) give some nice performances here, with special kudos going to Jeremy Renner as Mayor/FBI target Carmine Polito.",7,0,2,31 March 2014
The Revenant," 'We are all savages'
","I was utterly entranced for the entire length of this long, sad, and starkly beautiful film and didn't want it to end. The action sequences‚Äîbear attack, attacks by hostile Indians, struggles with other natural elements‚Äîtruly take the audience Right There with their ultra-realistic cinematography, costume design, and sound effects. Very good, often splendid acting by just about everyone, with special kudos going to Will Poulter as young Jim Bridger, and, of course, DiCaprio as protagonist Hugh Glass. Tom Hardy is also great as antagonist John Fitzgerald, a character who, no matter how much the bad guy he is, is still given a sprinkling of sympathetic qualities. The way that Glass and Fitzgerald resemble each other in both appearance and certain mannerisms is another interesting effect.I've noticed some complaints about THE REVENANT's length, and I can see why many will find its 2.5 hours overwhelming and draggy in certain places. The main reason why I can't quite give it ten shiners is that its plot follows the same basic pattern of so many other western vengeance dramas, particularly in its rather predictable ending. Still, the unique details and twists keep this from really hurting the film. The sheer number of supporting characters makes it hard to place who's who; nevertheless, this was obviously hard to avoid and also leaves room for multiple viewings‚ÄîI'm sure many will be as eager as I am to watch it again. Finally, some of the script/dialogue is rather flat and does not convincingly evoke the 1820s; e.g., 'Yep, the Indians are always stealing our s__t!' Some other notable things about THE REVENANT:--Wonderful use of parallels in details such as the bear cubs left motherless, the lone buffalo abandoned by the herd as it's devoured by stalking wolves, and the old Indian left behind in the abandoned village.--Amazing visuals of the Rocky Mountain setting and Glass's dream sequences.--The fact that THE REVENANT is based upon a true story (taking many liberties, of course) and that most of its primary characters were actual people leaves room to read-up and dig a little deeper.",9,0,2,1 February 2016
Silver Linings Playbook," SLP: An Interesting Combination of Qualities
","Some will call it a winning one; some will call it otherwise.SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK doesn't quite work as a conventional comedy because it just *isn't all that funny. As a drama about mental illness, it falls short because it tries too hard to be funny; plus, the lead characters are such stereotypes of bipolar-type people. {And in either case, the scenes of violence are horribly fake.} As a kind of funny-serious social satire on how everyone--along with the society they create and inhabit--is nuts in a myriad of ways, this film works VERY well, even if it does take some time to develop.The first half drags and is a bit unfocused; moreover, it seems overwrought with acting, script, and directions that try a bit too hard to portray crazy people. I found it very frustrating but soon discovered that it provided good set-up for the second half. There is also some nice and subtle foreshadowing here regarding the craziness of Pat (Cooper)'s family and all the other supposedly normal people in the film. While Jennifer Lawrence (as Tiffany) over-acts--just as Cooper does--it helps to elucidate the less stereotypical side of her in the second half. Her script--e.g., 'Humanity's just NASTY and there's NO silver lining!'--and entire character contribute a great deal to this film. The second half is also sometimes repetitive and unfocused, but the whole theme really shines through, and it could not end any better. Tiffany and Pat's dance scene is hypnotic (and I'll admit, pretty funny).In the end, it's fitting that a film about craziness follows such a crazy structure.*Many obviously disagree with me on how funny this film is--I'm just calling it as I see it.",7,0,1,11 June 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," 'Whatever you do, don't eat the f***ing candy!'
","HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS is an hilariously creative film that completely restored my faith in the whole subgenre of horror-comedy-- it's more of the latter, of course. While obviously nothing to be taken too seriously, this film does have a solid, cohesive plot-line with some nice surprises. The Sabbat scene is particularly worthy of mention. Expert filming and settings, makeup, eclectic soundtrack, and intentionally stupid but nonetheless lively script. Great props too--love the automatic crossbows and blunderbusses. While it could have gone a little farther in such areas, it makes some interesting revelations concerning Hansel and Gretel's familiar past, adding some interesting elaborations to the Grimm Bros' original tale as well as the entire mythos regarding 'medieval' witches. While this film is mostly its own original self, the borrowings and bits of spoof on WIZARD of OZ, BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, KING KONG, RED DAWN, and a score of others really add something to the mix.",8,0,1,22 July 2013
Tigerland," 'Why would I want to do that to another human being?'
","TIGERLAND takes place entirely within the confines of Infantry Training at Fort Polk, LA, and its immediate surroundings, 1971. The film itself does NOT actually go to Vietnam.The whole character of Roland Bozz (memorably played by Colin Farrell) is utterly intriguing. He's a bit overblown: A would-be perfect soldier, perfect leader, perfect shot, in perfect physical and mental condition. . .a rough, cynical, yet still paradoxically gentle character who just doesn't like armies and war and killing. Nevertheless, I think it would have detracted from the film if Bozz were not a bit larger-than-life. Ditto for the other characters, including the sergeants (both the cruel, sadistic, war-maddened ones and the tough but professional ones) and the other trainees (an interesting and convincing bunch of mixed motivations). While TIGERLAND's plot is quite gripping, it's essentially a character-driven film in the end, and the exemplary acting by just about everyone is what makes it such a success.I've noticed some other reviewers'--some of whom actually trained at Fork Polk during the Vietnam years--objections to TIGERLAND's depiction of the U.S. Army, particularly in regards to its training methods and employment of borderline-psychotic instructors. Duly noted, but it's safe to say that the U.S. military HAS made ample use of such methods/people at various times and places in the past. The film may not be perfectly realistic in every respect; however, it's also important to remember that it's set at a time when America, though still anemically hoping to win in Vietnam and still sending unfortunate draftees to same, was also trying to extricate itself from a war whose futility was becoming increasingly obvious. TIGERLAND captures the special malaise of the early '70s war with dead-eyed accuracy. Most importantly of all, it's a compelling portrayal of an anti-hero fighting against an army and system that doesn't play by any fair rules--not even its own.",9,5,7,14 June 2013
The Theory of Everything," 'Only time, whatever that may be, will tell'
","'The Theory of Everything' is worth seeing for anyone with a basic interest in Stephen Hawking. A pretty nice job of juxtaposing Hawking's scientific breakthroughs with his own (and everyone else's) human relations is its strongest suit. Eddie Redmayne's performance as this difficult-to-portray character is outstanding: He captures the disabled Hawking's perceptions and point of view very well. The film is slow but evenly paced, with a quiet humor throughout. Yet, the transitions are jerky and abrupt in many places, and we don't really see Jane's reasons for attraction to him, nor how, when, and why the marriage fails. Like many other things here, it all happens suddenly and randomly for no apparent reason. This may have been at least partly deliberate, as universal happenstance is another theme here, but still. . . The time-frames toward the end are also a little unclear, and there is little age-progression in most of the major characters. As others have noted, there is relatively little about Hawking's science in this film, and what there is is pretty basic. 'The Theory of Everything' is not meant, of course, as a detailed expos√© of singularity theory; however, just a bit more in this area would help to illustrate some of the more personal themes here. Most of the dialogue is also pretty ordinary: 'The Theory of Everything' keeps trying to reach for a depth that it never quite achieves. In a number of places, it stops just as things start to get interesting. It seems that the directors of this film were faced with a common dilemma faced when all the central characters are still with us and likely to be among the first viewers: They were making a film centered mostly on the Hawkings' personal life but were compelled to avoid getting TOO personal.Anyway, the theater concession stand attendant told me that she loves everything about this film, as many other people obviously do, so my reasons for being disappointed by certain parts of it are clearly not shared by everyone out there.",7,2,2,8 December 2014
Lincoln," Excellent Historical Drama
","First off, LINCOLN is more about the passage of the 13th Amendment outlawing slavery in the U.S. and all the haggling that took place in the House of Representatives beforehand than it is about Abe Lincoln personally. The entire story takes place in the early months of 1865 as the Civil War is winding down.Lincoln does, of course, play a pivotal role as the central character in his proposal and backing of the Amendment (yet still, kind of not wanting the war to end before it was voted upon in order to keep the Southern delegations out of the vote). There is also a fine subplot concerning Lincoln's life with his wife and sons, all of whom are admirably played. Day-Lewis really shines in his role as a Lincoln who is neither saint nor sinner, with a smooth, velvety, and vaguely southern(!) accent. Many of the supporting cast--most particularly, Jared Harris as Ulysses Grant--are also memorably portrayed.This may not sound terribly exciting to some, but the acting, storyline, scenery and everything else are so arresting that those people are likely to forget not being all that interested. Along with the vital ingredient of plot, some other best things about 'Lincoln' are its setting and costume design: This film probably conveys the Civil War period better than any that I've seen. There isn't much actual showing of the war, but a couple of very brief but vivid and ultra-realistic battleground scenes really spice things up. Both in Washington and in the brief scenes elsewhere, the cinematography takes you there in a powerful way.Finally, this film is very revealing about the 'buying' of votes in Congress and effectively shows how political processes worked and continue to work. A fascinating bit of historical and political intrigue.A couple of tips: --Younger audiences, unless they happen to have an unusual interest in political processes, are likely to be bored with LINCOLN.--If you aren't all that up on Secretary of State William Seward, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, and some of the various other players, it might be helpful to read-up a little on them before watching this.",9,9,15,7 May 2013
Casualties of War," 'Go to hell. . .SIR!'
","CASUALTIES of WAR is one of the very best of the late 80s Vietnam films. Being all about the rape and murder of a young Vietnamese girl by U.S. troops, it's understandable why this film produced much controversy and why there are so many quasi-political reasons for liking/disliking it. CASUALTIES of WAR is 'based on' something that actually happened, and I'm sure there are some departures from how exactly it all happened. While the critical aspects are obviously factual, I'm appraising this film simply as a drama and will let others quibble about how true or untrue the specifics are.Though he comes across as just a little TOO squeaky-clean, Michael J. Fox is decent in the lead role of Private Eriksson. I've noticed a number of criticisms of Sean Penn's portrayal of young charismatic Sergeant Meserve, but I find him to be an utterly convincing and memorable character and think this is one of Penn's very best performances, which is saying a lot. Those who play the other four soldiers in the understrength squad are similarly real, as are many of the supporting cast, particularly Dale Dye as Captain Hill and Ving Rhames as Lieutenant Reilly. Thuy Thu Le's strong performance as the victim is also noteworthy.Viewed simply as a war film, CASUALTIES of WAR has all the elements that anyone would look for in that genre. Before the pivotal event occurs, there is a lot of gripping combat footage of different types in different locations and situations with all the necessary plot, character development, and sense of place. Fine script too, believably quirky without falling to the stereotypical 'soldier-talk' we often encounter in films of this sort. There are also many themes to analyze if you're into it, especially in what this film shows us about the ironies of military 'justice.' And let's not forget the basic conflict of CASUALTIES of WAR. A crime of this nature can never be justified, of course, but this film does the best that can be done in showing the how and why of it all. Some have objected because they think it makes our troops look bad. It's an unavoidable fact, however, that a number of crimes of this magnitude did in fact occur during the Vietnam War, and they occurred more often than we'd probably like to think. At the same time, I do not think it's ever suggested that all or even most American troops in that war committed acts like the one shown here.Finally, CASUALTIES of WAR has a darkly beautiful ending.",9,5,6,15 April 2014
The Adjustment Bureau," 'All I have are the choices that I make'
","THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU revolves around a heady, far-out concept conveyed in simple everyday terms. The concepts/conflicts are all explained away to young maverick aspiring senator David Norris (Matt Damon) by the 'Adjustment Men' who oversee the destiny of the world and everyone in it. This, of course, kills this film's potential as a think-piece that many might want but makes it accessible to a more casual audience. Somehow, it all works splendidly, mostly because of the fine acting by all and the solid human interest story of Norris's love for ballerina Elise Sella, memorably played by Emily Blunt, a relationship that goes against the plans of the mysterious 'Chairman' who makes all the rules and plans our lives for us.This film is the most realistic sort of fantasy. . .or is it really fantasy?. . . that one can imagine. It's also good science fiction, even for people who generally hate science fiction. Finally, there is excellent social satire regarding politics, civilization in general, and all sorts of other things. While THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU takes what it has to say seriously, its mood is light-hearted and funny, without any need for serious violence or gore.As Einstein said, 'If you cannot explain it simply, you do not understand it well enough.' That being said, the creators of this film, based on a short story by the inimitable Philip K. Dick, knew exactly what they were doing.",8,0,1,10 February 2014
Prisoners," 2.5 Hours of Good, Gripping Suspense Drama
","Although a little more development in a few areas and a little less in others might have helped, PRISONERS will probably keep you watching and keep you guessing. Just an ultra-realistic, riveting film that will not end up exactly as you think it will. Nice use of subtle clues in the random bits of dialogue, written notes, and newspaper flashes.A number of sociological and religious themes can be delved from PRISONERS: How the families, police, perpetrators, and community-at-large are all made 'prisoners' by this event; the dangers of preconceived notions about who, why, and how the crime was committed, etc. At the same time, it doesn't just bombard us with deep ulterior meanings, and those who prefer to watch it as a simple 'thriller' may easily do so. Really fine all-around acting: Jake Gyllenhaal and Melissa Leo give especially commendable performances.",8,1,2,13 January 2014
The Fountain," This Film Is Blasphemy!!
","Just kidding.It is, however, a little melodramatic and preachy in places, and the same slow, mournful string concertos played over and over again in the background tend to overdo the intended mood of THE FOUNTAIN. Another thing: Most of the setting is in the darkness of a medical lab, outdoors at night, or in the depths of outer space. There are reasons for this, of course, but all the darkness requires the audience to adjust their senses and heightens the somber mood even more. Just a little more daylight and humor in key places would have been a plus.Nevertheless, THE FOUNTAIN intelligently takes on some big heady concepts, most importantly, our desire for immortality. As medical researcher Tommy explains, 'Death is a disease, just like any other. There is a cure, and I will find it!' Does he succeed? It's all debatable, and THE FOUNTAIN does a nice job of showing and telling us just enough while also leaving just enough for the individual viewer to interpret. There are a number of interesting hints regarding the possibility of reincarnation and, barring that, how we live on regardless of whether we continue to live physically and literally.THE FOUNTAIN seems like another obscurantist trying-too-hard-to-be-brilliant film at first, but if you stick with it past the initial 10-15 minutes, the three interrelated past-present-future stories come together very well. A number of other reviewers have described this film as 'a poem,' and I agree. That being the case, it should appeal to people who like poetry, but those who want a standard movie-film may be a little disconcerted by THE FOUNTAIN.",Null,1,2,26 June 2013
The Departed," 'Honesty is not synonymous with truth'
","THE DEPARTED makes fine use of its high heavens stellar cast. The way that Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Sullivan (Matt Damon) resemble each other can be confusing but still invokes a sort of alter-ego effect. Jack Nicholson also gives a commendable performance as aging Boston Irish Mafia boss Costello, as does Martin Sheen as SIU Chief Detective Queenan. One of the most memorable characters of all is Mark Wahlberg as abrasive meanie SIU detective Dignam.A super-violent film without true heroes, THE DEPARTED views like a sort of mini-epic video novel. Although there's no shortage of surprises and turnabouts, it doesn't have the sharp thrills and twists that many cop films do and doesn't need them. Everything develops at a natural but very compelling pace. The loud, profane, wise-cracking Boston dialogue is also something else: Though I wouldn't want to use many of them against my worst enemy, there are some outstanding insults here.As intense as it is, THE DEPARTED goes way beyond the level of a standard good guy cops versus bad guy criminals shoot-'em-up fest. This film tackles some big themes and is very revealing of what a maddening head-muck detective work can be and how easily destructible everyone is in the end.",9,1,3,18 May 2014
The Witch," 'The Devil holds fast thy eyelids'
","New England, 1630: A family is banished from their plantation community over unspecified practical or doctrinal differences--father William's 'prideful conceit' is all that we are told. They make a rough homestead in the wilderness, where their infant son disappears in the literal wink of an eye while under the care of eldest daughter Thomasin. . .catch the connotations of her name? A lot of creepy stuff follows.While the plot line's a bit too hazy to be truly satisfying, 'The Witch' is better and more original than most recent horror efforts. If more solid folklore and theology were brought in, this film might have been really great. It also could have worked better if the supernatural were left out altogether and everything was kept in the characters' guilt-ridden heads‚Äîor at least implied to be. I got a little restless during the draggy middle portions which, luckily, don't last long. That being said, those who want lots of action and constant surprises probably won't dig 'The Witch.' This film is also quite bleak, so the easily dejected should also perhaps avoid it.An interesting blend of supernatural and psychological horror. Keeps you guessing who's really evil--the parents, the children, neither, or both? Is the rabbit just a rabbit, the goats just goats? Is the silver cup really just an heirloom? Is it deliberate witchcraft, unwitting obsession or possession, or is the family just stir-crazy, overworked, and over-worried about how they'll survive the upcoming winter? Some of the middle details, along with the turnabout at the end, help to answer these questions, though they don't entirely--and who wants them to? The children's attempts at fun and games‚Äîor are they more than that?‚Äî add a great deal. It's easy to see why young kids would be bored out of their minds and willing to do just about anything for entertainment in these surroundings.Obviously fairly low budget, but the directors made good use of what they had to work with. A small cast and narrow use of settings, but good visuals, costume design, and dialogue. The latter is easy enough to understand if you know your basic thee-thou-hithers, etc. Still, it's hard to follow everything in a few places due to the heavy accents and muttering, so subtitles may be necessary‚ÄîI saw this in the theater, where there were none. While 'The Witch' avoids stereotyping the Puritan characters as completely austere and humorless, it conveys the setting pretty convincingly. Good acting by all the main cast, but especially those who play the four children.",8,1,6,14 March 2016
12 Years a Slave," 'I simply ask that you use all of your senses before rendering judgment'
","Directed by Steve McQueen and crew, this is definitely one of the very best films to come out in recent years. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is expertly filmed and gives an immediate recreation of the antebellum South. The acting by just about everyone is similarly outstanding, with special kudos going to Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northrup, Sara Paulson as Mistress Ebs, Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey, and Paul Dano as Tibeats. This film truly captures the barbarity of slavery in America and slavery in general: The empathy with its victims is disturbingly keen. Scenes such as that of the mother being separated from her young children at the auction are realistically heartrending. This film is also revealing of the Biblical justifications that slaveholders often used and the frequency with which female slaves were raped by plantation owners and overseers. At the same time, however, all of the characters are well-rounded. Without sugarcoating anything, 12 YEARS A SLAVE portrays even the cruelest of its subjects as eminently human and shows the varying degrees of humanity and inhumanity among slaveholders. Plenty happens, with a number of reversals and surprises, but, as in many intelligent dramas, there isn't any one defining climactic moment. There are one or two vague spots, and the sheer number of characters can be confusing. Nevertheless, I cannot imagine anyone with a normal attention span and interest in the subject matter failing to be engrossed by 12 YEARS A SLAVE. Yes, this subject has been done before in a number of earlier films, but it's still done very well here.As important as its subject may be, however, 12 YEARS A SLAVE is not just a film about slavery in America during the 1800s. It's about the will to power and the will to survive, human greed, human dignity, human guile and deception, and many other complications that occur between members of the human race. While it never stops to preach, the psychology of it all is powerful stuff, and there are characters in whom any modern person will find her/himself. As odd as this may sound, anyone who's ever worked at a job where they were treated disparagingly or been pressured to downplay their level of education and intelligence in order to avoid offending their 'superiors' should immediately identify with the plights of Solomon Northrup and the other slave characters.Still, if you want to just watch it for the story and don't feel like analyzing its many themes, you may easily do so. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is just a very fine, perhaps even great drama, the sort that can be watched again and again. If you enjoy this film, I might also recommend 1997's ARMISTAD.",9,0,1,12 April 2014
The Woman in Black," 'Don't go chasing shadows, Arthur!'
","Daniel Radcliffe gives a memorable performance as Arthur Kipps, a London solicitor (attorney) and widowed father of a 4-year-old boy who is on thin ice with his firm due to non-productivity because of grief over his wife's passing. He is given one final chance to prove his value to the firm and keep his job: Go to the remote village of Crythin Gifford and settle the probate affairs of the rambling, secluded mansion of Eel Marsh House, whose tenants recently died. He soon discovers and becomes immersed in the macabre secrets of the house and village in this carefully told story.THE WOMAN in BLACK is the sort of thing I didn't think could still be done these days, a Gothic horror story about a haunted house with a clever, original plot and mythos, disturbing images but no schlocky gore for its own sake, and above all, genuinely frightening qualities. The question of whether or not Kipps will keep his job adds to the suspense. The cinematography is first-rate, with bleakly striking views of the English countryside and village. The early 1900s time period is captured most convincingly. Excellent acting by everyone else as well, particularly the various child actors and Ciar√°n Hinds as local resident Sam Daily. Finally, a beautifully unexpected ending.",9,0,1,9 May 2014
Flight," Despite Some Unlikehoods and Ambiguities, FLIGHT Is Far from Being a Disaster (ha-ha)
","Washington is at top-form in the role of an anti-hero: alcoholic, cokehead, ladies' man airline pilot Whip Whitaker. The other fine actors--too many to mention here, but Kelly Reilly's performance is especially noteworthy--also contribute a great deal to FLIGHT. The air altercation is harrowingly realistic, one of the many ways this film puts you right there.On the other hand, FLIGHT tries to compensate for its grittiness (including a gratuitous scene of female nudity at the very beginning) by becoming a sort of 12-step morality play in the middle and latter portions. Alternatively, all the sex, dope, and vulgarity, it seems, are intended to keep the film from being too heavy-handedly moralistic, an odd combination that doesn't entirely work. While FLIGHT is not of an outwardly religious nature, there's much mention of God, which--though as a believer, I like it--hints at some agenda on the part of the film's own creators.FLIGHT becomes repetitively melodramatic toward the middle portions. More on the FTSB's investigations/legal entanglements and less on the turpitude of Whitaker's life would have made this an altogether more interesting film; a more distant point of view focusing less on Whitaker personally and more on the whole big picture would also have been a probable plus. Some choice editing probably could have cut 20-30 unnecessary minutes. There are also a number of 'too easys,' e.g., some of the stuff the pilots' union attorney is able to accomplish with a seeming flick of his hand. Finally, several characters don't contribute all that much to the plot--FLIGHT's a bit too crowded. (I just mentioned Reilly's fine performance, but I'm not sure the character she plays is even that necessary.) Still, for all my criticisms, I can't give FLIGHT anything less than 7 stars. The good aspects of this film (polished acting and cinematography, a number of small but well-earned surprises, its entire generally compelling nature) are good indeed, and those with a little patience should enjoy it.",7,2,3,6 February 2013
The Purge," 'Nothing is ever going to be okay again!'
","Seeing the THE PURGE's rating here and on Amazon, I didn't get my hopes too high. I found it compelling and watchable enough, decently acted, and professionally filmed. Otherwise, it was something of a let-down.As many others have noted, THE PURGE has a very original premise, and there's a lot more that the makers of this film could have done with it. Some of the various themes regarding contemporary America--classism, nationalism, gun-obsession, neighborhood relations and competition, etc--also begged for a little more development. But in the end, THE PURGE just becomes another run-of-the-mill shoot-'em-up fest.It would have done miracles for this film if it had begun a few days BEFORE 'Purge Night,' giving a little more background on the Sandin family's relationship with their neighbors, dad's business relationship with the community, and daughter Zoey's forbidden relationship with boyfriend Henry. That way, what happens during 'Purge Night,' especially at the very end, would be better-earned and make a lot more sense.",5,1,1,8 November 2013
Looper," I Thoroughly Enjoyed LOOPER
","Despite seeing the previews, reading several reviews, and basically knowing beforehand what LOOPER's all about, I have to say that it still took me by surprise in many ways. Really fine acting, script, and cinematography bring about an immediate realism, which is especially important in a film set in the future with numerous science fictional/fantastic elements. I'm distractible and often downright dense but still followed the important points of what's going on here. LOOPER is definitely NOT one of those films that just tries to befuddle us with supposedly brilliant BS. It's one that you can watch again and again, always picking up something new in the way of hints, nuances, and details of plot.There are a few plot holes, which is almost inevitable in a film about time paradoxes, i.e., if time travel ever becomes a reality, will it be possible to go back and change what's already occurred? A few other little imperfections here and there, but it's a film that's good enough to where something is gained even from the blemishes. This is true of anything, I suppose, but if you watch LOOPER expecting it to be good, the various anachronisms and illogicalities shouldn't be too glaring. On the other hand, if you watch it in a really critical frame of mind, on the look-out for defects, said defects may be all too evident.The near future (2044) setting is well-done: A lot of interesting technology, but nothing too 'out there.' It's also interesting to see how Kansas City might look 30 years from now. LOOPER will obviously resonate with many science fiction aficionados, and even many who generally hate this genre will find themselves making an exception here.This is one of Bruce Willis's finest performances. Emily Blunt as Sara is outstanding both actress and character-wise. Last but far from least, Pierce Gagnon as 5-year-old Cid is simply hypnotic and virtually steals the show whenever he's in it.",9,1,4,27 April 2013
Cloud Atlas," 'My Life Extends Far Beyond the Limitations of Me'
","This film's upholders rave about how brilliant and meaningful it is, while its detractors rant about how pretentious and nonsensical it is.I can see both sides of the argument, but let me just say this. One has to have 3 solid hours and a great deal of patience to spare before watching CLOUD ATLAS. Anyone who has those two things and views this film fairly attentively should at least see that the plot-line DOES make sense. Not having read David Mitchell's original novel, I know I missed a few things on first view, and the beginning in particular was mind-blendingly confusing. We generally expect the opening of a story/film to 'hook' us, establish the basic cast of characters and conflicts, and all that sort of stuff. This would be hard to accomplish in a work of this sort, which is a bit like THE MATRIX meets THE English PATIENT.I stayed with CLOUD ATLAS, and though it wore me out, I was able to appreciate the whole story of domino effects spanning over centuries of human history: How acts of both kindness and malice trickle down, ripple out, and so forth. There's nothing 'brilliant' or even particularly original about that, but I know of very few films that tie together so many settings in time and place this well.CLOUD ATLAS may not seem like the sort of thing to see for easy entertainment, but I think the best advice comes from those who recommend just watching this film for 'the ride.' The cinematography, setting and costume design, and special effects are all quite amazing even by today's standards. You don't have to catch all the details to appreciate what's basically going on here, and new stuff will emerge with each re-view.And if you don't like it, well, just turn it off.",8,1,2,21 June 2013
The Social Network," Gripping and Illuminating
","THE SOCIAL NETWORK is very well-filmed, and though the dialogue is sometimes a little TOO ultra-witty, its fine acting helps to bring about an immediate realism. It focuses mainly on the legal complications and conundrums, i.e., lawsuits by Zuckerberg's fellow students at Harvard who played big roles in spawning and developing the whole idea of Facebook. I never would have dreamed it possible that someone could make a legal drama set mostly in depositions rather than trials work so well, but this film accomplishes just that--the fact that it's a true story certainly helps. It gives a well-rounded and convincing picture of the various entanglements Facebook went through in its early stages, also effectively showing how just about any large corporation-to-be experiences similar issues. While Zuckerberg is portrayed as less-than-likable, his precocity is hard to ignore, and THE SOCIAL NETWORK gives a very non-editorialized portrayal of him and all the other players here. There's also a lot of Ivy League-level girl-chasing, partying, and so forth, which, again, is shown so realistically that it's quite engrossing.",8,0,2,10 September 2013
The Martian," 'I'm the first person to be alone on an entire planet'
","I'd heard nothing but great things about this film beforehand. After seeing it, my verdict is 'Good, but far from great.' It certainly keeps your attention, and is an interesting mix of science fiction, survival tale, thriller-diller, and political intrigue. What it shows about NASA's dilemmas in how/when they tell the public what is happening, how they assess the respective risks in their various options, and so forth is pretty convincing. Still, I have to wonder if NASA would really go to all this expense and trouble in trying to save one person whose odds of survival are stacked this high against him.A few other random points: *Some breath-taking Martian and outer space scenery. I would have liked more in this department, particularly on Mars-in-general, but I suppose that one of the film's strengths is that it doesn't try too hard to bedazzle us. The primary mission here is to show one fellow's fight to survive in a distant and hostile environment.*Some real surprises and turnabouts which, particularly toward the end, descend into yeah-right unlikelihoods and too-easies. Many people, it seems, would rather have big stretches and reaches than boring predictabilities, and the whole story is, of course, pretty unlikely, though not impossible. Nevertheless, the makers of this film could have tried a little harder in several key places.*Though I've never been a huge Matt Damon fan, those who are should enjoy his performance as marooned exobotanist Mark Watney. Jessica Chastain, Sean Bean, and a couple of others steal the show insofar as acting goes: It's just unfortunate that we don't see more of them. Much of the dialogue, particularly Watney's‚Äî'In your FACE, Neil Armstrong!' etc--is rather hokey and not quite as clever as intended.*While I'm a novice in these areas, some of the science and technology here is obviously implausible, and I would guess that most rocket scientists and physicists would find it downright ludicrous in a number of spots.*Last but certainly not least, the zero-g scenes are a lot of fun. Trying to leave the stadium-style theater at the end, I was so marvelously disoriented that I walked UP toward the camera portal instead of DOWN toward the exit. (Yes, I mean this in a good way.)",7,6,13,26 October 2015
