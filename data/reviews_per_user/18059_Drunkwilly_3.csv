Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A True Masterpiece!!
","Tarantino has truly outdone himself with the second installment of Kill Bill!!  This movie and its predecessor transcend the normal parameters of, 'sequelness,' and usher an innovative and sheik perspective on film making. The first film was a true, first-rate action movie, driven by frustration, anger, and of course: VENGENCE!  The second was truly a great movie, that wasn't so driven by revenge as it was a critique on motherhood and dysfunctional relationships.  In any case both of these movies compliment each other to no end.  Kill Bill Vol. 2 especially sits close to my heart alongside Vol. I as truly one of my favorite movies!!  It also sits prominently atop the huge mountain made up of vast amounts of movies and their subsequent sequels!!  Thank you Q.T. and the rest of the cast and crew that made it a delight to go to the movies again!!!!",10,0,1,26 April 2004
Batman Begins," Nothing Short of Excellence
","In the days preceding my venture to the movie theatre I couldn't help, but hear all the good things critics, fans, and non-fans were saying about this helping of THE BAT. However, I still had slights skepticism over the film. Could Bale really pull off both Bruce Wayne and Batman? How would Gary Oldman do as the good cop for once? What's up with Liam & Morgan?? Oh, and let me not forget: Cillian Murphy and what's her face?? I loved 28 Days Later, but Dr. Crane/Scarecrow, but absolutely detested Dawson's Creek. Could this all work? The only thing I was sure of was Mikey Cane.I think my subtle doubts were just my way of trying to rationalize and turn my utter subjectivity into an objective & critical approach to a film I WAS VERY EXCITED TO SEE!! Almost like a bit of negative reinforcement. 'No superhero film could be that well received.' And after sitting in a dark movie theatre in about the fifth row from the mammoth movie screen I didn't care about the five months of chiropractic treatment I need from having my neck half cocked back for two plus hours. I was completely blown away. WOW!! A superhero movie that is actually grounded itself in our physical reality. A movie that was dark, but not because the director used an all black color setting (No offense to Mr. Burton-the original Batman will always be a classic, but because we have the appropriate background to gage our hero. We as viewers get to see the twisted and methodical weaving of Bruce Wayne's thought process. We understand the devotion of Alfred to Bruce. We see the connection between Gordon and the BAT. We understand the science behind the BAT devices. We all know how the BAT can defeat the insurmountable odds that face him. We have a psychological thriller in our hands here. The perfect ingredient for bat stew. What could make a man dress like a bat? Now we all know.It's not even worth mentioning the last three movies. They're not even worthy of an annoying internet POP-UP to inform you they suck. This movie eradicates all existing notions, visions, and themes of what was previously Batman and offers a real view of a real man.My hats off to Bale, Freeman, Oldman, Murphy, Liam N.(I forgot how to spell his last name, but I'm too lazy to check), Cane, and even Mrs. Cruise, huh? uh...I mean Ms. Holmes. Also, Gothom city looks amazing!!! It doesn't look like a movie set. It looks like a real city. There's actually scenes with daylight!! Mr. Nolan is exactly what this type of movie needed. I am again BLOWN AWAY.To all those who haven't yet--GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",10,3,4,19 June 2005
Donnie Darko," Mind Blowing
","'Why do you wear that stupid bunny suit? Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?'-Donnie & Frank (the Bunny) This movie is absolutely mind-blowing. It's hard to classify to one specific film genre. It's sardonically dark, edgy, gripping, and tragic. I guess if there is one genre to put it into; it would have to be AWESOME. However, that is only a word and does not do this film proper justice. This movie has changed my opinion of Jake Glynenhaal completely. Prior to viewing 'Donnie D.' if felt he was a blas√© type of actor. I was wrong. I might have to watch all of his films over and re-critique how he formulates the characters he portrays. If you by chance are reading this comment STOP.Only watching this movie(multiple times) could one begin to decipher it's deeper meanings. Enjoy!",10,0,1,12 January 2005
