The Blair Witch Project," What do qualified media profs think!
","Me:  Sir, what did you think of the BWP?Prof:  HahahhaahhaahhahahaehehehehhehohohohohehheehhhahahahaaaaaaaH!!!!!Me:  oh....hehenh....ITS THE WORST!!!!!     I guess because of all the hype about this production...it kinda gave his higher hopes....I honestly don't have to time to list all the terrible things in this 'film' so I'm just going to say this;   It a classic example of the media destroying a film before the audience even had a chance to view it...kinda like an overplayed song on the radio, the BWP served only as a disappointment to many film makers, film students and my mom. I literally laughed through the whole movie...WHEN WAS IT EVER SCARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  pfft!!!!!  thats all I have to say.",3,0,1,21 January 2000
