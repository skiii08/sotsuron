The Benchwarmers," Stink-A-Rooo
","Benchwarmers is a Awful movie in my opinion.It has a Great cast for a comedy, but everything about this movie was just plain dumb.Watching this movie reminded me of the goofy movies they made in the 70's.Rob schneider did a OK job, only because his character was normal.David Spade's worst roll ever.The 3rd retarded kids roll isn't even worthy of me remembering his name, truly awful.Jon Lovitz did a good job, i thought he was funny in his part, but again, he was a normal guy The story lines just dumb, 3 middle aged guys who play baseball against 10-13 year olds who people look at as hero's? The kids in this movie, well, they were kids, lol.I found stupid humor that wasn't even funny. oh well.Absolute WORST movie in their career in my book.I would only recommend this movie if there was no other movie on and they were running my mother the car on very other station.Stink-a-roo",1,1,2,30 October 2008
Knocked Up," i watched 2 years after film, - Stink-A-Roo
","This movie was a 5, average.I found no one likable in this film. wait = Harold Ramas, ben's dad's 5 minute cameo was likable.The movie wasn't too funny. sure parts were, but it was very childish.The biggest part that was actually dumb was the relationship between ben and allison.sure a hotty might bed a slug like seth rogan, but even after getting pregnant, there's nothing realistic between them.seth rogan is a shmuck with no feelings, and not even a girl with low self esteem would want him, let alone allison.the entire cast sucked in this film, even though some are good actors in other stuff.it's worth a free watch on TV, but don't waste your money.",5,3,6,15 October 2009
The Green Mile," A+ Movie - Must See
","A Great Movie! Yes i'm writing this 10 years after it was released, but i was compelled to give my opinion.This movie centers around 1940's death row, and has many interesting characters that center around a head officer and a huge black prisoner. The meek giant has the power to see into people lives and heal the sick.Now throw in a slew of top notch actors and you have yourself a great cast, well written story, and will keep your interest throughout.I liked that this movie didn't really show the racism side of life.It's a long movie, 3 hours with commercials, but it's worth watching.A+ all the way",10,0,2,8 January 2009
