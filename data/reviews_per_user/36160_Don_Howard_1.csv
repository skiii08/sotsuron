Deja Vu," The fun of a Paradox....
","The cycle created can't be started or finished. He started the case because of the ferry incident and finding her body.. then it led up to him going back and stopping it... so nothing can lead to him going back. He left himself clues that helped him get to the point where he can go back and leave himself clues.He saw his own ambulance after the 'new reality' would have taken place. So if a new reality is formed as soon as something changes.. shouldn't it have been a different reality. I mean.. they didn't say when he stops the ferry from exploding did they? They said when something changes.. which it did the second he pulled those doctor's from surgery to revive him. THEN he stole the ambulance.. so why would he have seen it in the other reality's future...Now that I think about it.. there are too many to type. You get the idea.. not the worst time travel movie.. not the best. Time travel never works, but as long as it is entertaining, I guess its OK. I like T2 and it had a paradox too (John sending a man back in time who gets his mother pregnant with him). I am not saying it sucks just felt compelled to type the word paradox and prepare for people to tear this apart.....",4,2,4,25 April 2007
