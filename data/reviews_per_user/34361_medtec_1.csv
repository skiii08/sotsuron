The Blair Witch Project," The most horrifying film I have ever seen.
","This film still sticks in my mind and probably will for days to come.  No blood, no gore; only sheer terror for most of the film.  Not only was I horrified but I felt a strong compassion for the characters as I watched them disintegrate  before my eyes.  When one of the characters apologizes on film I just wanted to let her know it was not her fault.  Unfortunately because of the opening lines in the film I knew her fate was sealed and there wasn't going to be any happy endings.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
