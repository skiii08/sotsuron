Sucker Punch," A mega-dose of SurREALism
","ART LIVES! Zack Snyder PROVES IT!!! This unique film is an outstanding depiction of juxtaposition, at it's best, within reality. I'd watch this film a 100 times rather than watching a 100 films of nauseating scenarios where, most often, people act like idiots. Given their situation, I think the character each girl portrays does real well. As far as any brutalities, well, it's the characters without scruples who are never less than ugly. Dang it! Why can't more people appreciate the compelling beauty of solidarity?! BTW, excellent cinematography & soundtrack! Thanks man, for making a great film for those who don't shrink within their own imaginations.",Null,1,3,10 August 2011
