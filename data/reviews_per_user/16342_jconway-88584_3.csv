Moneyball," Makes you care
","I'm english and know nothing much of baseball, but this film managed to make me care for a team in a league I have no business caring for.Brad, Jonah and their crew really put on a great show worthy of the academy nominations they received.If you don't like the Oakland A's, i think this film will change that.Great stuff",8,5,6,6 August 2019
Fight Club," An epic journey into your psychology
","Fight club is not only thrilling and dangerously entertaining, it also questions the morale nature of humans in an incredibly unique and fresh light. We all desire more from our lives, freedom from the mundane, but to what lengths would you go?Even 20 years later this film holds up an epic standard and I reckon you should watch. I reckon you'd like it.It's also useful if you're interested in investing in the soap industry.",9,0,0,3 August 2019
Drive," Riveting and exciting, excellent cinema
","Ryan Gosling smashes it in this performance. Incredibly enjoyable and unique, one of 2011's finest. Like nothing you've ever seen before. I urge you to watch this movie, you will not regret it and it will fit comfortably amongst your favourites.",9,1,2,3 August 2019
