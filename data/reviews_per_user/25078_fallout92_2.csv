Scarface," an awesome movie
","This movie is freaking awesome if you have not seen it yet,then get your butt off the couch or wherever you are and rent it or buy it. Trust me you won't regret it.Al Pacino greatly portrays the Cuban cocaine sniffing mobster Tony Montana who soon becomes one of Miami's leading mobsters. Tony Montana just doesn't kill the pretty much king pin of the town he marries his wife too.That is how bad this dude is.This movie is so hard core it blows me out of my seat.This movie is full of awesome action and great and crazy characters, it also has a strong story and it keeps you at the edge of your seat the whole movie.So if you want to see a good movie then you should get Al Pacino's Scarface.",10,2,4,26 March 2005
Army of Darkness," Good Bad I'm the Guy with the Gun. Ash is back
","Ash is fighting the evil dead for the third and probably the last time. This movie is priceless I crack up every time I watch this comedy. It just keeps gets funnier and funnier.The lines Good Bad I'm the guy with the gun, or this is my boom stick will always keep me laughing. The movie starts out flash backing to the second movie and shows Ash cutting of his dead hand and putting on his chainsaw and then he gets sucked back in time ware he gets tossed in a monster mid evil pit, fights tiny Ashes at a mill, gets bitten by a book, makes an army to fight the army of darkness, makes out with 2 hot chicks,defeats the army of darkness,and unites two Kingdoms.OH yea and drinks a liquid that sends him back to his own time.Get this movie no mater how expensive it is it is so awesome.I have seen it at Wall Mart for $5.50.",Null,2,3,26 March 2005
