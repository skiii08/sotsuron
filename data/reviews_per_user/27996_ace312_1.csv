The Rock," brilliant
","Sean Connery and Nicolas cage are at there best thats a fact Sean Connery wasn't that good in rising sun nor was Nicolas cage in 8 millimetre. but they are both doing what there meant to and that's to entertain people like me. i think nick and Sean make a better acting duo than Sean and Wesley Sinpes did, not get me wrong it's a brilliant film i was just expecting more from 2 really good actor's.anyone who disagrees can tell me at my e-mail address ace312@hotmail.co.uk. and if any girls want to talk to me they can i'm single and horny 16 and gagging for sex. my names Richard. p.s the rock is the tits!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,2,3,29 September 2006
