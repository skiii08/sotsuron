The New World," Well done though historically inaccurate...
","Terrence Malick, the director, once again creates a film of extraordinary beauty.Yes his films tend to be slower than most Hollywood films. In this case, though, I think the slowness is well suited to what the director is trying to convey.It's my opinion that Malick wanted to bring our 21st century mindsets back to the pacing of life in the early 1600s. Things took time. And in that sense,, he has succeeded.The film unfolds like chapters in a novel. Keeping that analogy, I think it would help the average movie goer to keep this in mind before watching the film. Expectations are always key, so if one goes into this film expecting a slow paced film, I think the viewer will then be able to relax and let the mood of the film do its job.Collin Farrell was fine in his role as Captain John Smith. Unlike his unfortunate portrayal of Alexander in the movie of the same name, here Farrell blends well into the time frame.Q'Orianka Kilcher playing Pocahontas was truly wonderful and handled here role with a wisdom beyond her years.Christian Bale, as usual gives a thoroughly professional performance though his role is small and only in the last forty minutes of the movie or so.Christpher Plummer, also, while in a small role, gives his typical professional job.Malick is famous for his gorgeous cinematography and he doesn't disappoint his fans one bit with this film.I enjoyed the movie quite a lot. I knew going into it, that Malick doesn't always rely solely on narrative structure but uses mood ambiance, the sense of time passing, etc. to help tell his story.That being said, be aware that liberties were taken with historical accuracy. The biggest liberty being the age of Pocahontas.Pocahontas would have been about 10-12 years old when she encountered Captain Smith. Captain Smith's age was accurately portrayed as he would have been around 27 years old, approximately the same age as Mr. Farrell.Historians say that Captain Smith's account of his being saved by Pocahontas were probably embellishments by Captain Smith made many years later to give his story of his time in the new world some excitement.Further, writings by Captain Smith the first winter after his time in the new world, make no mention of the story of Pocahontas saving his life but rather that he was treated as an honored guest of the Powhantan people.So it is a bit unfortunate that Mr Malick in all his efforts to create as accurate a movie as possible, should, for his own devices, fabricate the central story of his movie.For accuracy's sake, he would have been better served to show Pocahontas as the child she was in the beginning of the movie and instead of focusing on her relationship with Captain Smith, focus on her relationship with John Rolfe, who was after all, more central to her life than Captain Smith was.",8,2,5,4 September 2006
Love and Death," Classic Allen/Keaton Pairing!
","Love and Death (1975) Dir: Woody Allen Keaton's third go around with Mr. Allen, who again writes the screenplay as well as directs. And again, it's a hit! Woody and Diane play a Russian couple who wind up attempting to murder Napoleon Bonaparte! Slapstick at it's best. A classic Woody/Diane movie.",10,1,1,27 April 2004
Minority Report," Fun quickly forgotten sci-fi flick with cool gadgets.....
","Thought the movie was fun, certainly nothing you'll remember but entertaining enough for it's running time. Cruise does his usual 'MR.SERIOUS' routine and it was fun seeing newbie Collin Farrell give Cruise the 'I CAN BE SERIOUS TOO' routine right back in his face. You could just tell Farrell was having fun breaking Cruise's balls...At least I hope he was....It's always a pleasure to see Max Von Sydow, a consumate professional. Samantha Morton was good in her role as the 'pre-cog'. I haven't read the source material this movie was based on so as far as that goes I have no idea how faithful it was, not that I really care. Whether the movie is good or bad has nothing to do with it's source material. If the movie's good, then it's good. As I said, this is fun escapist, easily forgotten fluff. Perfect summer stuff to get out of the heat of the day and to enjoy a fun ride.",10,0,1,8 June 2004
The Best Years of Our Lives," Classic American Film!
","The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) - Director: William Wyler The war is over and three veterans return home to small town America and deal with 'readjustment.'  One of the few and one of the best movies ever made to address what happens when the guns stop shooting and soldiers return home to resume their lives. The stellar cast includes Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright and Dana Andrews--all who give touching and human performances.  There are too many famous scenes to name them all, but a favorite one shows wife Myrna Loy caught unaware by a surprise return home by husband Fredric March. Watch her body language as she hears the door of her home open and for a second yells out to her children, asking who's there, then realizing it might, it might...A classic American film.

Shutter Island," Grade C flick straight out of the M. Night Shyamalan school of film-making
","Big disappointment here folks. The movie relies too much on atmosphere and stretches 90 minutes of plot over 2 1/2 hours of film.The film would most definitely have benefited from trimming its running time to 90 minutes. Seriously.Sure DiCaprio is great as ever, but there's just not enough in this movie to sink your teeth into.And it's TOTALLY an M. Night Shyamalan ripoff. Which isn't a compliment by any means! Don't get mislead by some of the other reviewers who try to compare this movie's slowness to say, Hitchcock's Vertigo. Sorry, but no way is the comparison even close! Don't waste your money on this one folks...even if you're a die hard DiCaprio fan.Get the DVD out of your local library for free instead.And by the way, I'm a huge Scorsese fan so you know I'm totally disappointed.",5,5,12,20 February 2010
Lost in Translation," Weak on script, overrated film with good performance by young Scarlett Johanson & good but overrated performance by Bill Murray
","Too much time & effort has been wasted over this movie. When the dust settles, viewers will see it for what it really is. A small movie with a couple of good (though not great) performances with a rather undeveloped script substituting as 'atmosphere'. Bill Murray goes against type (kinda) in this movie. While not opting for the out & out belly laughs, still his character is rather loose & relaxed with a sense of humor at the ready, hardly a stretch and though while he is good in the part, it's not like he delivers a performance full of magical moments or unexpected artistic punches. I can't for the life of me understand why he was nomintated. Scarlett Johnason is good in her role and given the fact that she's so young is even more impressive than Murray's good performance. Ms. Coppola certainly has her father talent for directing unfortunately, her script was rather undeveloped and left the two leads with not much to sink their teeth into. I wouldn't lose sleep if you haven't managed to catch this flick yet.",Null,0,1,21 June 2004
American Beauty," See The Ice Storm instead!
","For movie goers who want to see the same subject matter covered with real depth and nuance, I suggest you see The Ice Storm released in about the same time period and totally overlooked by the Academy Awards. I'm no prude as is evidenced by my recommending The Ice Storm, however, my idea of an opening scene in a movie is not seeing Kevin Spacey masturbating in a shower. I found this movie to be crude, shallow and hugely overrated. Kevin Spacey's acting job is nothing special in this movie and he most definitely did not deserve an Academy award for acting in a lead role! Mr. Chris Cooper was much more effective and  affecting in his smaller role as the conflicted ex-military neighbor.This movie, like Blackhawk down, has all the earmarks of being directed by someone who came out of the MTV school of filmmaking (one of my harshest condemnations! All style, no substance).I'm already seeing this movie noted in film critic's annual MOVIES THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE WON AN OSCAR articles!",1,3,8,12 April 2004
28 Days Later...," All special effects but no soul......
","You see this trend in a lot of films these days. Technology has made it possible to have very cool effects in movies and you see filmmakers relying heavily on these special effects to fill up the minutes in their film. However, you're left watching the movie simply for the effects, like a video game without any caring for the characters and the development of the story. I just finished watching 28 Days Later. There'd been a lot of hype on it, so I figured I give it a shot. Absolutely no emotional connection with this flick. Visually, it played like a long Marilyn Manson video with zombies. Sure there were a couple of jolts in the flick that startle you but that hardly qualifys as true horror. The Blair Witch Project (though hardly a fully realized film and not a movie I particularly liked) provided way more horror without the use of one special effect. Simply a dark forest and a flashlight was able to raise the hair on the back of people's necks in that flick. If you're in the mood to get scared, skip this movie and rent ALIEN instead.",Null,2,3,30 April 2004
The Longest Day," Classic WWII Film!!
","The Longest Day (1962) - CO-Directors: Ken Annakin & Andrew Morton Everyone knows this was producer Darryl F. Zanuck's baby and it earns its place in cinema history as one of those epic style movies that treats its subject matter with the most serious of attitudes. Obviously a war is no laughing matter but, for better or worse, movies tend to simplify logistics while highlighting emotional chords, such as bravery and homemade apple pie. Zanuck, however, wanted the audience to understand the scope and grandeur of an enterprise like D-Day.Utilizing a cast of thousands, half of which seemed to be cameo appearances by major stars of the day, Zanuck presents on wide screen all the action and turmoil that surrounded this turning point of WW II. The ever-fighting Republican John Wayne is there, along with Democrat Henry Fonda, tough guy Bob Mitchum, brooding Richard Burton, sexy Sean Connery and pit bullish Rod Steiger.  Still for my money, one of the best landing on the beach scenes ever filmed.  Sorry Mr.Spielberg. (B&W)",Null,11,11,27 April 2004
Patton," WWII Classic!
","Patton (1970) - Director: Franklin J. Schaffner Yes, this is the one where George C. Scott as General Patton stands in front of that building-sized flag and tells the audience that no poor son of a bitch ever won a war by dying for his country. He wins the war by making the son of a bitch from the other country die. Ah Richard Nixon here we come.This is war film as history for sure and much is made of Patton's obsession with Caesar and lots of mythic posturing runs amok in the film.  The film suffers from a confusion of whether it wants to be a pro or anti war film but it still boasts one of the greatest tour deforce acting jobs ever seen in film.Karl Malden is around as General Omar Bradley having to pick up the broken pieces. If you're feeling cranky, this is the one to watch. (Color)",10,1,5,27 April 2004
Black Hawk Down," All style no substance
","I refer to this kind of film making as the MTV school of film making. All glitz & quick editing . I thought this movie a huge disappointment. I know the movie did well at the box office, but it will not stand the test of time. Basically this movie was a Friday/Saturday night flick for the male teenagers to go see. Lots of action & not very much else.",1,4,11,29 December 2003
2001: A Space Odyssey," Masterpiece of film making.......
","After reading some of the user comments on this film I felt I'd like to add my two cents.I consider this film to be one of the masterpieces in the world of cinema. Would I want every film to be similar in structure? No, I would not. But that does not diminish the accomplishment of this film.I've read comments from users citing the film as boring, hard to understand, pointless & lacking in narrative.I feel these opinions are based more on the expectations of what a film should be and not on what the film actually is.What this film does and brilliantly I might add is to challenge the concept of what the medium of film can be. Instead of using film as a medium to tell a straight forward narrative, the film ascends to loftier goals.  I see the movie as a piece of art. Cinematic art. I liken the experience of watching 2001 as viewing a great masterpiece of art.I don't watch 2001 to merely have some science fiction author's hypothesis of the nature of existence explained to me. I watch it for the visual feast combined with the haunting score and challenging intellectual theories presented. Film is first & foremost a visual medium. The use of sound in the form of scoring compliments the visual for sure. But dialogue between characters is only relied upon in this movie when it is absolutely necessary to further the story.The film is not fast paced. But slow pacing in and of itself does not condemn this or any other film. It's what the creator does with the pace of the film that matters.In many ways, for me, this film is a ballet. Key scenes in the timeline of man are presented and there is this dance of life. Dance of death. The constant struggle to further the awareness of life, the possibilities of existence, the barriers of death of time & of space. It's heady stuff for sure and the movie only presents scenarios, possibilities. It does not provide answers. It only suggests what ifs. And it does it with visuals combined with a perfect score that to this day, inspire film makers & audiences worldwide.",10,23,51,29 December 2003
Invincible," Quality film making from Disney
","Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.No the film does not focus on the Eagles professional sports organization. So if you're looking for a film that does that, you're probably going to be disappointed.The film focuses on our hero and to a large degree his neighborhood friends and what it was like for a 30 year old bartender who only played organized football in high school and how he showed up one Saturday at an unprecedented open try out for a professional football team and how he was selected....not selected to join the team automatically.No, he was only selected for a spot to possibly be on the team. It took a few weeks of being with the team and surviving 'cuts' until he was actually part of the team.The fact that he did make it, against all the odds, is certainly your classic fairy tale come true.Disney manages to show rough guys from a rough part of Philadelpia and rough professional football players realistically without ever having to utter one profanity on the screen or use gratuitous violence or vulgarity to do it. That's an accomplishment Disney should be proud of.Honestly, as a movie buff, it's been a long time since I've gone to the movies where I was able to stay engaged throughout the running time of the movie.The movie isn't pretentious nor does it take the easy way out in telling its story of rough blue collar characters-by employing vulgarity, overt sexuality or excessive violence.It relies on tried and true methods like a good storyline, taking the time to establish a good foundation in the beginning of the movie, letting the audience get to know the characters involved and then when the bigger more dramatic moments come it doesn't need to rely on over the top special affects to get the audience involved.That being said, the actual professional football game scenes are well done with just enough special affects to give the audience the feel that these actors really were on that playing field playing the game.I really can't say enough about this movie. When all the hype fades away on other overly marketed & bigger budgeted movies, it will be a movie like this one, that you'll reach for over and over again in your personal movie library.And while we're at it, hats off to Mark Whalberg for a sensitive, well acted portrayal.",8,78,85,30 August 2006
It's a Wonderful Life," Holiday Classic!
","It's A Wonderful Life (1946- Directed by Frank Capra) I suppose most of us are familiar with this holiday classic.  It's hard to believe that on it's initial release the movie didn't really do well at the box office. Jimmy Stewart plays the Job-like George Bailey who gets taught the lesson of a lifetime by friendly angel Clarence Oddbody played by Henry Travers.  With Donna Reed playing his wife Mary and a host of other familiar character actors, Capra weaves a tale of the importance of a single human life. Old timer Lionel Barrymore (great uncle of current Charlie's Angel, Drew) gives the quintessential performance of a rich soulless banker.What's so great about this movie after repeated viewing is how well the story is constructed.  Every scene ties so well into the overall plot and gives information about the action about to take place or explains events in the past.  So many lines from this movie are quotable that it's hard to chose one for inclusion here.  Although one of the sweetest is early on in the movie, when our heroine Mary, as a child whispers into her already man of her dreams, George's bad ear, 'George Bailey, I'll love you till the day I die.'Don't rent this video. Buy it.",10,1,5,27 April 2004
Love Actually," Hate actually........
","This movie is such tripe that I now understand why a movie that was supposed to be so good did so poorly at the box office. Because the general public knows an over-hyped, shallow, vulgar, piece of crap masking as 'romantic comedy' when it sees it. I should have known that something was up when the credits were barely over & Hugh Grant is narrating about love and how there really is so much love in the world and that we just don't notice it and then he remarks on how the victims of the World Trade Center when they were making their last phone calls to family had nothing but love in their hearts not hatred which is probably true but seemed a very strange choice to use in the beginning of a romantic comedy. Apparently it was a portent of things to come.The movie shoves characters and story lines into our faces without any story development and then expects us to care as every clichéd trick in the book is used to squeeze an emotion out of us. My primary emotion throughout the movie was disgust. On top of this was coarse language totally out of place in a quote un quote light romantic comedy.So many story lines throwing so much out at us and we're supposed to be amused and engaged by all of this. As usual with 'multi' story lines, after the first story is presented, the rest only serve to interrupt and distract or force the audience no matter how unwillingly to choose which storyline they prefer.It's a shame about the movie. There are some good story lines, some fine performances, Laura Linney in particular but again, the movie just jumps in without warming up it's audience so that by the time starts reaching it's dramatic peaks, you're too p***ed to care.And now we get to really bad part of the movie. Hugh Grant practically doing a parody of his on screen self is absolutely, atrociously bad as none other than the Prime Minster of England.He's totally unbelievable in the role.Billy Bob Thorton as President of the United States in a cameo role gives another great performance as a sleazy Clinton-esqe type.Unfortunately the film also includes a rather silly scene where Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister at a press conference with Billy Bob's President makes a rather dumb statement to the press about how the UK is although a small country, a great one and the US has been a big bully so the UK is going to be tough too. Seriously. This is presented as a serious political 'moment' in the film. Besides the fact that the political statement is totally out of place in the film and besides the fact that UK's Prime Minister is standing strong and tall as an ally of the US despite criticism in his own country, besides all this, it's just another incredibly stupid moment in the film. This is one very strange movie.",1,26,50,6 June 2004
Jaws," Beach Horror Classic!
","aws (1975 Dir. Steven Speilberg) Even if you've seen this horror blockbuster a thousand times before you simply have to rent this video during the summer months. For those of you who have been living on Mars for the last thirty years or so and are not familiar with this classic horror flick, a local beach town in peak tourist season is terrorized by one very large and hungry shark.Robert Shaw stars as a classic Captain Ahab type complete with sailing songs, salty language and a fondness for the grape. An early performance by Richard Dreyfuss and '70s star Roy Scheider round out the cast. Steven Speilberg takes the American tradition of fun at the beach and turns it into a classic horror tale of Man vs Nature. For extra points, watch it the night before a planned outing to the shore. If you dare.",10,7,13,27 April 2004
Any Given Sunday," Trash from Stone.......
","After watching this movie, one has to feel sorry for Oliver Stone. His world must be pretty bleak because this movie is nothing but trash. Stone shows absolutely no respect for his characters and presents a world as corrupted as Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. Only he does this not by quality film making, but simply by having his characters cursing and basically behaving like pigs constantly throughout the movie. His editing is from the MTV, how many cuts can we make in 30 seconds school of thought and the soundtrack is down right offensive, unless you're idea of theme music is 'you're my nigger' being played. Apparently this is Stone's idea of racial awareness. Stone takes on too many issues in this movie. Corporate greed, racial injustice, old school vs new school football & more. Halfway thru this 2-1/2 hour music video, Stone throws in the creative towel and literally inserts an MTV style music video into the movie. The setup is that the new quarterback is shooting a commercial for some nutrient. Anyway, this flick is slick, trash, without a soul. I'm no football expert, and I'm sure I'm naive on the inner workings of professional football but I'm also sure that Oliver Stone has made a movie that repels its audience. Near the end of the movie, there's one scene that stands out among the rest. Stone intercuts his movie with the chariot scene from Cecil B. Demille's classic Ben Hur. Unfortunately for Stone, all this scene serves to do is to hi-lite just how soulless & empty his movie by comparison really is.",1,1,4,21 April 2004
Ben-Hur," Worst Movie To Ever Win Best Picture Oscar?
","No long review...I'm gonna keep this short & sweet. This has got to be one of the worst movies ever! Certainly it ranks up there in one of the worst Best Picture Oscar winners.I simply can't understand the popularity of this movie...It just drags and drags and drags.It literally has one scene in the movie that holds any interest for me and of course that's the classic chariot race scene.If you've never seen this movie but you feel you must, I would advise you to get a DVD & immediately click on the chariot scene. If you do that, you'll have seen the only worthwhile part of this movie.If you want to watch a fun, entertaining biblical epic, check out The Ten Commandments, again with Charlton Heston. It tends to lean toward the campy, actually, but that's really what makes it fun. DeMille wound up making a melodrama on the epic scale instead of a ponderous, deadly slow film like Ben Hur.Ben Hur is one BAD movie and I love movies...have seen thousands and I'm telling you: This is THE WORST!!!!",1,25,91,28 July 2006
The Deer Hunter," One of the best movies of the 70s.....
","The Deer Hunter (1978) Another pseudo-war movie, only this time the action revolves around the conflict in Vietnam. Streep effectively portrays a young woman at home in the states who must deal with the effects of the war in her own psyche as well as the men who have gone off to fight.The part, though not a starring role, provides a great deal more screen time than was afforded Streep in Julia. And she makes the most of it. When adding this performance to her body of work, audiences can see a string of unforgettable characterizations that made her, arguably, America's greatest living and working actress.Starring Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken among others, The Deer Hunter, along with another Vietnam movie made the following year, Apocalypse Now, remains one of the greatest war films ever made. It won the Oscar for Best Picture, and is a harrowing and poetic movie, not to be missed.",10,4,10,27 April 2004
Munich," Major Disappointment
","This COULD have been a good film IF the director had been disciplined enough to decide on just what kind of film genre he wanted to make and then stuck to it.Instead Spielberg goes from action/adventure to caper to political thriller to drama all the while throwing in some not so subtle propaganda.No wonder the movie was almost three hours long! The film would have worked so much better if Spielberg had condensed some of the killings into one montage. Not JUST because the movie would have been shorter but because the montage would have emphasized, cinematically, the fact that the killings were starting to get out of control and become blurred...instead of just showing the same basic scene over and over again.Spielberg needs to look at some of Francis Coppola's films to get a lesson in what a good montage scene can do for a film.The other thing that really bothered me about the film is when a director manipulates the audience into thinking that he's somehow above the fray of politics and that the film being shown is somehow morally on a higher ground. It especially bothers me when the film in question, winds up being very politically pointed, though the director would be loathe to admit it.And I'm not arguing whether I agreed or disagreed with the politics in the movie. What I'm saying is that there ARE political sides taken, though perhaps not the obvious ones demonstrated by the characters in the movie, but still, political views, by the director were espoused. So if that's the case, at least be straightforward about it instead of manipulating me and and further publicly stating that the movie was above 'politics'.Case in point: The movie ends when two characters in an outside location in the NY Metropolitan area walk away from each other and the viewer is left with a shot of the skyline of NY City.You guessed it...The twin towers of the World Trade Center are the most noticeable reference point in the shot. Hardly a coincidence in a three hour movie dealing with terrorism.Obviously Spielberg was again, stating his political agenda loud and clear. Which is fine, but the movie, like its director, refuses to accept ownership of its own beliefs.And on a more personal note, I thought one of the later scenes inter-cutting Bana having intercourse with his wife while yet another terrorist attack was being perpetrated was not moving...it was just gross.Again, Mr. Spielberg should watch some of Mr. Coppola's films to see how 'GOOD' montages are done.I do want to say though, that Eric Bana is a strong leading man who has a lot of charisma. He should have a long career ahead of him.",6,2,7,1 September 2006
Gangs of New York," Entertaining movie, but Scorcese's done better.......
","Certainly this is a well done movie. Big budget, A-list stars, one of the world's best directors. Much has been said of the authentic town reconstruction, well done cinematography. Is it one of my favorite films after seeing it? No. Did I enjoy it? Yes I did, but I wouldn't be in a rush to see it again anytime soon. Perhaps a couple of years from now I'll re-watch it and enjoy it more without the expectations that I had going in to the movie. What problems did I have with the movie? Well, it does suffer from what so many movies of our age suffer from and that is that it doesn't know when to end. It's an awfully long movie.  I also felt the movie had a very closed in feeling to it which was a result of Scorcese's decision to shoot as much of the movie as possible in the recreated set made for the movie. Personally I think this choice backfired to a certain degree. Sure you want to present an authentic setting (hence the reason for the realistic set) HOWEVER scene after scene set in the same sets and streets unfortunately gave the film the impression that the budget was in fact smaller than it was and that the whole movie was forced to use these sets because they couldn't afford location shots. It's like they shot the movie on a really cool looking back lot set which is I'm sure the opposite of what Scorcese was trying to accomplish. Ex, there's one scene in particular, where Cameron Diaz's character goes to another part of the city. You only get to see this set once, yet just by virtue of the fact that you're seeing a different locale was a welcome relief. I would have had more shots down by the docks, etc. Just because people lived in those crowded areas doesn't mean that they wouldn't venture to parks, the water's edge, etc to escape the over crowding. Well that overcrowding and constant focus on these built sets gave the film a low budget feel which is ironic of course since the sets cost so much to build. Certainly the casting of Diaz is troubling. Not a highly versatile actress she does what she can but her presence still strikes a jarring modern note while book-ended by the highly talented DiCaprio & Day Lewis immersing themselves in period feel. Where's Cate Blanchett when you need her? I know the movie was well liked when it came out and it is a good movie, but I suspect that over the years, much of the fanfare of this movie (similar to Saving Private Ryan) will die down and it will take its proper place in film history as a good movie that could have been so much more.",Null,0,1,5 May 2004
