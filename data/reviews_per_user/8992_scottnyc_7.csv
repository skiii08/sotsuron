Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Entertaining, but a mere shadow of its great forebears
","George Lucas sacrifices story, theme, character and relationships in favor of wildly lavish production designs and overwhelming special effects.  The movie is entertaining enough; the key pod-racing scene is a brilliant set piece; Liam Neeson's leading performance is excellent; the character of Anakin is original, enormously appealing and beautifully cast in the person of Jake Lloyd; the designs are gorgeous if overstuffed and the special effects are state-of-the-art.  But the movie is nearly ruined by its most remarkable technical accomplishment: that intergallactic hybrid of Roger Rabbit and Step'n'Fetchit, Jar Jar Binks.  Most of all, its thin story lacks any of the mythic richness of the first trilogy, and the characters, with the possible exception of Anakin, are barely introduced as paper cut-outs compared with the characters of the first three movies, and their relationships get no more interesting than the over-obvious effort to foreshadow the future of Anakin and Queen Amidala.  Still, there is cause to hope that in the next two movies Lucas will turn enough of his attention away from his special effects to give full-bodied life to the new chapters of his great cinematic epic.",5,0,1,17 June 2000
Memento," Now that's what I call screenwriting!
","As dazzling a display of the screenwriter's craft as I have ever seen. Thrillingly directed, with a breathtaking ending...um, beginning, well, beginning and ending actually, which means also ending and beginning. Anyway, it's just kick-ass.  I don't know when I have ever put so much energy into giving a movie my full attention, and had my effort so satisfyingly rewarded.",10,0,2,16 November 2003
Memento," Absolutely Riveting
","A thrillingly virtuoso display of the craft of screenwriting.  If the picture as a whole falls just short of greatness, largely because the ending does not reach a deeply visceral level of satisfaction, I still believe I have never seen a more *engrossing* movie--ever.  I was riveted for two solid hours, using last brain cell and loving every minute of it.  Guy Pearce and the rest of the cast are superb, the editing is exquisite, the direction is crackerjack, but the writing, the writing!  Mind-blowing.",10,0,1,18 March 2001
The Shining," Now without doubt a classic
","This is one of those films that age well.  Very controversial in its time, I think it is now clearly a classic.  Should Nicholson have gotten an Oscar over DeNiro's performance in *Raging Bull*?  No, obviously not--Nicholson is borderline hilarious in this, as is Shelley Duvall and for that matter even the great Anne Jackson (Scatman Crothers is, unambiguously, intentionally hilarious).  But Kubrick's movies are not about 'good' acting in the usual sense, and Nicholson's most over-the-top, eyebrow-popping, tongue-flicking, scenery-chewing mugging here works like a charm in a way it could not in any other movie because Kubrick was a complete original and a genius.  This movie simultaneously amuses, engrosses, terrifies AND alienates.  I'm not here to say it's Kubrick's best movie, but it's certainly the one I've gone out of my way to see the most times so I suppose it's my favorite. It's not the scariest movie I've ever seen (that would be *Halloween,* and at least half a dozen movies rank above this one on that scale), but I defy anyone to genuinely watch this film with an open mind and not have the snot scared out of him/her at least 20 times.  And it is certainly more artistically ambitious than all but two or three of the films I've seen that are scarier than this one.I hope my review displaces the absolutely boneheaded one that was up on this movie's page when I checked it out (what exactly is a 'prodding' screenplay?).  This is not one of the 10 best movies I've ever seen, but it may be one of the 100 best, so it deserves more respect than it's getting on this site at the moment.",Null,0,0,11 January 2003
Judgment at Nuremberg," A great humanistic document, compelling and nearly timeless
","I am actually humbled by this film, and I am unusually grateful to have seen it, finally, 45 years after its making.There are some superficial aspects of *Judgement at Nuremberg* that are dated: some of Stanley Kramer's camera-work is unnecessarily showy or gimmicky. Some of the sets are noticeably fake, and some of the dialog is stilted, especially in early scenes outside the courtroom. The music goes momentarily over the top in the climactic confrontation between the key defendant, played by Burt Lancaster, and the chief judge (Spencer Tracy) after the trial.Much more striking, however, are the film's strengths, and how unusually well it holds up. I usually think of Kramer as an overstated liberal autodidact, but here the acting is, for the most part, admirably restrained and authentic. Even *William Shatner*--no kidding--is subtle here. After an unpromisingly sensational opening salvo by Richard Widmark as the chief prosecutor, this movie settles into a gravity, balance and rigorous honesty (both intellectual and emotional) that are utterly necessary for a serious treatment of a subject as overwhelmingly important as the origin and expression of Nazi evil.Balance is a key to this film's greatness. It is not insignificant that it was Maximillian Schell, who played the Nazi judges' defense attorney not as a slimy shyster but as a powerfully rigorous advocate determined to hold the *world's* feet to the fire rather than let his clients become patsies for a vast breakdown of moral responsibility with astonishingly widespread implications. By looking courageously into the teeth of the reality of German society and politics leading up to and during the Second World War and the reality of American, European and Communist moral failings, Abby Mann's great screenplay creates an extraordinarily persuasive context for the extraordinarily powerful thematic statements against Nazi atrocities with which it concludes.Two scenes near the movie's conclusion struck me most powerfully. First, I have never been more sickened, enraged and humbled by visual evidence of the Holocaust than I was when it was presented in the context of the trial at this film's center. Second, I was chilled--frightened in a very contemporary and immediate way--by the great speech of judgment given at the trial's end by Spencer Tracy's Chief Judge Dan Hayward. I urge anyone that is concerned about the erosion of civil liberties in America today to watch this film to better understand how insidiously evil may overtake a modern nation in crisis. More important, I urge anyone that believes that America is today in a crisis that requires extraordinary measures to watch this movie, listen with an open mind to this speech, and consider its implications for the direction of our own country today.Stepping down now from my soap box, let me say more clearly: Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Never mind how old it is or how long it is or how dreary the subject may seem. If you care about the fate of humanity, you too will be grateful.",10,12,14,29 April 2006
Schindler's List," Good, but SO overrated
","This is not a bad movie; it has some excellent performances and cinematography, some good writing, some terrifying and moving imagery.  But the key scene near the end is DREADFUL and the movie, on balance, is the most overrated I can think of.",6,2,6,3 February 2001
The Sixth Sense," A fine movie but certainly not a great one
","Although this is a fine movie, it is one of the most overrated by audiences in recent years.  Among the film's main strengths are the stunning performance of child actor Haley Joel Osment and by the young actress who plays his mother.The script is very clever but also very, very sentimental.  This is not to say that the scene near the end of the picture when the boy connects on a new level is not moving--it is.  But the ending of the story of Willis's character is more effective as a stunt than as a source of honest emotion.I will say, though, that the scenes intended to be scary are really, really scary.  This owes largely to Osment's performance, which draws us into complete identification with the haunted child at the movie's center.  It is also a credit to the screenwriter/director, though the movie's scares are never adequately integrated with the gooey emotion at the movie's heart.I recommend THE SIXTH SENSE, but I insist that it is not the 'great' movie that current popular sentiment suggests.",6,0,0,17 October 1999
