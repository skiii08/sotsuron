Ali," A man that did so much, this movie did nothing for him
","Ali the film had all the right elements, a good budget and good actors, what was missing was real direction, and a real script. This movie had the oppourtunity to go into Ali's entire life where he did real good things, instead I felt it was lazily put together with things that people already know, there was almost less things to take about ali's life in this movie than from When we were kings. I think the person who signaled this script only saw that documentary. The story lacked energy, something that Ali had a lot of, and all I kept feeling was depressed, depressed the story never went back to his childhood or after his win over George, depressed that will smith looked depressed the whole time making this movie, depressed the only dialog they gave us was from interviews that people have already seen. Nothing in this movie has filled in the blanks about ALi's life, except that he cheated on his wives. Something I would have not wanted to see, because it just didn't fit. He is one of my only heros and I was not once impressed with this movie at all, I had low expectations and they were fully satisfied watching it.A man that did so much, this movie did nothing for him. I definitely do not recommend even watching this movie because its too long, and too ugly. Watch 'When we were kings' at least you will appreciate that it is really him on screen.",5,0,1,22 July 2007
Quantum of Solace," Forget the know it all critics, this is a great Bond Film
","Seeing too much negative criticism about this film I had to leave a comment. I hate when people go to an action movie and get upset when they see an action movie. This film has all the Bond glamor, and top notch action sequences I have seen to date. The film is great at developing the bond character, something we never see in old bond films. I feel like after every bond film, his slate is wiped clean and nothing from the previous films affects the character in the next. This movie is propelled by what happened in Casino Royale, and I am very happy the franchise is doing this. Bond's character is being developed, and people find it hard to accept change, which is probably why all the comments are not raving about this film. All I have to say is, see it for yourself, you won't be disappointed. Acting, directing, writing, and action is excellent. I think Daniel Craig has saved this franchise from disappearing.Great film",10,6,12,30 November 2008
Lord of War," The best story ever told about guns in the world.
","I just saw this movie tonight and I have never been more excited and proud to see this great director, come with a full budget he deserved. The film was very realistic in dealing with actual events and countries. With most of Niccol's work, there is always an underlying issue maybe very clear or not but to me I always see something about his stories, and how he incorporates some philosophical ideas in the character development of each main actor. This I like about the movie because you can watch this movie, and feel realism in it, and as well a clear vision of ideas in the way they are executed. By far one of the best movies to spend your money on, even if you don't have any because I know I don't, and it was worth.",10,1,6,16 September 2005
