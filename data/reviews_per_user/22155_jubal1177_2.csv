The Ring," Stupid, Stupid, Stupid
","I don't think I can put into words how stupid this movie was. The other movie I watched today, The Scorpion King, was ten times better than this boring piece of crap. It started out like it was gonna be a spoof of horror movies, but turned out to pretend to be something it wasn't, which is a real horror movie. The Ring wasn't scary in the least, I didn't care about any of the characters, and I really couldn't have cared less about the dumb, meandering, and pointless story. I have seen four movies in the past two days that I never wanted to waste my time seeing. Now that I've seen them (Underworld, Scorpion King, The Ring, and 28 Days Later) I wish I would have stuck with my gut feeling and just not watched any of them. SK was the best of the four, and the other three all sucked about the same amount, although in different ways. If you have not seen this movie yet, heed my advice and stay away from it.",1,0,2,25 May 2004
Underworld," I want the time I wasted watching this crap back
","Has got to be one of the most pointless movies I've ever had the displeasure of viewing. The story was stupid and fragmented and made no sense whatsoever. Underworld went nowhere fast. Just violence that I couldn't have cared less about. If there had been some character development and a story maybe the violence wouldn't have seemed so pointless and empty. I am just glad I didn't waste the money to this in the theater. Luckily I just borrowed it from my sister who buys every piece of crap that comes out. I rate this movie right down there with Pearl Harbor and Ghost Ship. Stupid, Stupid movie. Do not waste your time on trash like this. I want my time back.",3,0,2,24 May 2004
