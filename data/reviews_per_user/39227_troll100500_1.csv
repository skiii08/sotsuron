Iron Man 3," All in all, good
","Just like everybody else I was excited about this movie, but I think I never expected it to be as good as the first one. The only thing I was praying for was for the creators to give me a better experience than the one I had with Iron Man 2. And it did.So, the story involves Tony Stark's confrontation with Mandarin. Not to give anything away, there's a twist connected with the main villain, but any average movie-goer will call it about 40 minutes in. There's also a story going on with Tony's growing paranoia about his and his partner's safety. This is actually my biggest problem with the movie: the writers don't go deep enough into Tony's personal story and development. All his issues seem to be resolved off screen or during one of endless array of fight scenes. With that said, I do believe that Tony's obsession with the suit could make for a great story, which could be told so much better, should the writers skip a few action scenes and devote more time to character development. Aside from that, the story doesn't offer many surprises, but is compelling enough to keep you from being bored, with some genuinely funny jokes and a few really good action scenes. All in all, a good addition to the franchise, definitely better than Iron Man 2. Totally worth seeing just for Robert Downey Jr.'s great (as always) performance and some high-quality action sequences in the frames of a decent story.",8,0,5,5 May 2013
