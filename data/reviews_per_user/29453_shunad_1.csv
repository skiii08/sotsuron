Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Good film with lots of action
","The first film in the series was a good movie, the 2nd was too long and I didn't bother with the 3rd because it was longer. This time it is a decent film but still too long. The story is that after escaping from a hanging Jack Sparrow played by Johnny Depp ends up on the ship of Blackbeard, it was a good idea to put him in this movie cause he's a well known pirate. I thought the humour was the best of all the films because it made me chuckle quite a few times. The acting was up to the standard of the previous films, Johnny Depp did a great job. The characters were good however it has too many new characters and not enough old, all it has is Jack Gibbs and Captain Barbosa. The length was too long, it was a good length for most of the film but dragged on near the end. The action was brilliant, there was a good amount of action scenes for example the mermaids in the sea. Overall this is a good film but the ending was disappointing. I give it 8/10.",8,1,2,1 June 2011
